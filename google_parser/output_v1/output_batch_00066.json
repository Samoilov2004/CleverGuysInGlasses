Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims priority from Australian Patent Application No. 2008903552 filed Jul. 11, 2009, the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to peptide-based compositions, analogs thereof and their use in medicine, for example in a method of diagnosis and/or prognosis and/or therapy of the human or animal body or in an ex vivo method of diagnosis and/or prognosis and/or therapy of the human or animal body.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\nProtein-Protein Interactions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe majority of biological processes in living organisms are mediated by proteins and their interactions with specific ligands e.g., other proteins, antigens, antibodies, nucleic acids, lipids and carbohydrates. Not only are such interactions involved in normal biological processes, protein interactions are also causative of processes involved in diseases or disorders. As a consequence, protein interactions are important targets for the development of new therapeutic compounds.\n\n\n \nCD40 Ligand (CD40L or CD154) and CD40L Signaling Effects\n\n\n \n \n \nCD40 ligand is a trimeric, transmembrane protein of the tumor necrosis factor family. A large variety of immunologic and vascular cells have been found to express CD40, CD40 ligand, or both.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the CD40 ligand (CD40L or CD154), which is not expressed on resting human T cells, is up-regulated on the T-cell surface in response to foreign antigen presentation on MHC-class II molecules, up-regulation of the B7 antigen on the B-cell surface, formation of a complex between T-cells and B-cells via the T-cell receptor (TCR), and antigen recognition. Stimulation through the TCR also activates the T-cells, initiating T-cell cytokine production, interaction between the CD28 antigen on T-cells and the B7 antigen on B cells and binding of CD40L to CD40 receptor on the B-cell surface to thereby stimulate the B-cell to mature into a plasma cell secreting immunoglobulin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe interaction between CD40L and the CD40 receptor may also cause adverse effects and transformed cells from patients with low-grade and high-grade B-cell lymphomas, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Hodgkin's disease express CD40. CD40 expression is also detected in two-thirds of acute myeloblastic leukemia cases and 50% of AIDS-related lymphomas. Immunoblastic B-cell lymphomas frequently arise in immune-compromized individuals such as allograft recipients and others receiving long-term immunosuppressive therapy, AIDS patients, and patients with primary immunodeficiency syndromes such as X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome or Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome (Thomas et al., Adv. Cancer Res. 57, 329 (1991); Straus et al., Ann. Intern. Med. 118, 45 (1993). Malignant B cells from several tumors of B-cell lineage express a high degree of CD40 and appear to depend on CD40 signaling for survival and proliferation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCD40-CD40L interactions may also promote immune-mediated angiogenesis, gut inflammation, acute intestinal injury or chronic intestinal injury, in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). For example, the engagement of CD40L-activated HIF supernatants induce angiogenic events as determined by migration of HUMECs and tubule formation, both of which are inhibited using antibodies that bind to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-8 (IL-8) or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Additionally, CD40-deficient and CD40L-deficient mice are protected from DSS-induced colitis and display significant impairment of gut inflammation-driven angiogenesis, as determined by their microvascular density (Danese et al., Gut 56, 1248-1256, 2007).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCD40-CD40L interaction also activates extracellular signal-regulated \nkinase\n 1/2 and nuclear factor-KB pathways in insulinoma NIT-1 cells, and inhibitors of either pathway suppress cytokine/chemokine production in islets and up-regulate intercellular adhesion molecule-1 associated with inflammation, contributing to early islet graft loss after transplantation (Barbé-Tuana et al., Diabetes 55, 2437-2445, 2006).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell types typically resident in atherosclerotic plaques e.g., endothelial cells, macrophages and smooth muscle cells also express CD40L, and exposure to CD40L stimulates a broad inflammatory response in these cells such as heightened expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, matrix degrading enzymes, and pro-coagulants, thereby leading to atherogenesis and lesion complication (Alderson et al., J Exp Med. 178, 669-674, 1993; Mach et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94, 1931-1936, 1997; Schonbeck et al., Circ Res. 89, 1092-1103, 2001; Mach et al., Nature 394, 200-203, 1998; Bavendiek et al., Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 25, 1244-1249, 2005). Animals that are deficient in CD40L have reduced levels of atherosclerosis on high-cholesterol diets and atherosclerotic lesions in such animals display features associated with plaque stability e.g., reduced macrophage count, reduced lipid content, increased collagen content (Lutgens et al., Nat. Med. 5, 1313-1316, 1999; Schonbeck et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97, 7458-7463, 2000). The soluble 18 kDa CD40L protein released from platelets on platelet activation may identify first or recurrent cardiovascular events, which further supports the pathogenic role of CD40L (Heeschen et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 348, 1104-1111, 2003; Schonbeck et al., Circulation 104, 2266-2268, 2001; Varo et al., Circulation 107, 2664-2669, 2003). Recently, Zirlik et al., Circulation 115, 1571-1580, 2007 demonstrated that CD40L interacts with Mac-1 on monocytes, and functionally enhances Mac-1 dependent monocyte adhesion and migration in vitro, and that inhibition of Mac-1 in vivo in LDLR−/− mice slows lesion development and macrophage accumulation in atherosclerotic plaques. Zirlik et al. suggest that the CD40L-Mac-1 interaction may participate, albeit not necessarily exclusively, in the expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines including MIP-2, interleukin-1β, IL-8, pro-coagulant tissue factor, and in the activation of pro-inflammatory NF-κB. Thus, CD40L not only may attract inflammatory cells via Mac-1, but also induces the expression of a variety of pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant functions that promote atherogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nElevated soluble CD40L is also prognostic of an increased risk of thrombosis and cardiac ischemia.\n\n\n \nModulators of Protein-Protein Interactions\n\n\n \n \n \nTo identify suitable therapeutic compounds, the pharmaceutical industry has particularly focussed on screening processes to identify antibodies, peptides and small molecule compounds capable of interacting with a protein and/or inhibiting a protein interaction. To function as a drug suitable for administration to a subject an antibody, peptide or small molecule must be capable of binding to a target with high affinity and selectivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides offer significant advantages over antibodies in terms of uptake and low immunogenicity, and over small molecules in terms of reduced toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. Molecular Shape Considerations\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOften, small molecules and short peptides do not effectively modulate protein interactions because they do not generally possess a required shape e.g., to fit into complex protein surfaces or bind to relatively featureless interfaces. As a consequence, small-molecules ands short peptides are generally unable to bind to many surfaces of a target protein with sufficiently-high affinity and specificity to modulate binding of a ligand to the target, or to otherwise agonize or antagonize the activity of the target protein. Accordingly, there is a high attrition rate for the screening of such molecules as drug leads for therapeutic applications, particularly for targets such as protein interactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Random Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of example, notwithstanding that short random peptides e.g., peptide aptamers, may be sufficiently small for commercial i.e., large-scale production by chemical synthesis, they generally provide highly-variable bioactivities against target proteins, and interactions with their targets are generally low affinity interactions. For example, in a screen of a random peptide library to identify a peptide capable of dissociating HIV protease fewer than about 1×10-6 peptides displayed the desired activity (Park and Raines Nat. Biotechnol., 18: 548-550, 2000). This low “hit” rate appears to be a result of the inability of the such random peptides to assume stable secondary structure and/or tertiary structure to thereby facilitate binding to a target protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3. Structural Constraint\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn response to the low “hit” rate for identifying new drug leads, the pharmaceutical industry has expended some effort in developing synthetic scaffolds for presenting ligands to proteins, with a view to modulating activity of the target protein. However, such constraint of random peptide libraries has failed to increase the “hit” rate for identifying new drug candidates based on random peptide sequences to a level that makes peptides a viable alternative to small molecules. For example, random peptides have been constrained within scaffold structures e.g., the active site loop of thioredoxin (“Trx”; Colas et al., Nature, 380: 548-550, 1996) and tested for binding to cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (Cdk-2), however fewer than 2×10-5 of the Trx-constrained peptides actually blocked the target. Thus, the provision of synthetic scaffolds does not necessarily enhance “hit” rate. It is also possible that the limited repertoire of artificial scaffolds available to the industry will necessarily limit the diversity of structures that can be produced using such approaches, and may even mask or modify any native structures formed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4. Secondary Structures, Domains, Sub-Domains and Folds\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNative proteins have considerable structural features, including protein “domains” that are generally of functional significance. Until the present invention, such structural features have largely been utilized to determine evolutionary relationships between proteins, and for dissecting dynamic folding pathways i.e., how particular proteins fold. For example, the CATH database (Orengo et al., \nStructure\n 5, 1093-1108, 1997) classifies proteins according to a hierarchy of Class, Architecture, Topology and Homologous superfamily based upon structure, sequence, and functional considerations. In particular, the CATH hierarchy acknowledges three basic structural features i.e., class, architecture and topology. Protein “class” is highest in the CATH hierarchy and, in this context is a reference to the secondary structure composition and packing of a protein i.e., mainly α-helix, mainly β-strand, and α−β including alternating a/β in which the secondary structures alternate along the protein chain, and α+β in which the α and β regions are largely segregated. Thus, the “class” to which a protein belongs is a global assignment based on secondary structure considerations. Protein “architecture” refers to the overall shape of a protein based upon groups of similar secondary structural arrangements irrespective of the order in which they are connected in the protein. Protein “topology” describes the relative associations and orientations of secondary structures in 3D and the order in which they are connected. Protein “folds” are recognized in the CATH hierarchy as a function of topology, however the literature is confusing in this respect, because a fold can adopt a specific architecture e.g., Orengo and Thornton, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 74, 867-900, 2005.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “fold” is therefore taken in its broadest context to mean a tertiary structure formed by the folding of multiple secondary structures including aspects of both architecture and topology. Herein, the term “subdomain” is used interchangeably with the term “fold”. A “fold” may form independently or in association with other parts of a protein or other proteins or a scaffold structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 1 herein includes descriptions of segments of proteins comprising protein domains.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary structures adopted by homologous superfamilies of proteins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure\n\n\nArchitecture and/or topology of folds within proteins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-helix\n\n\nα-helices;

However, the following definitions are provided for clarity below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Meander” is a simple topology of a beta-sheet where any two consecutive strands are adjacent and antiparallel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Up-and-down” is the simplest topology for a helical bundle or folded leaf, in which consecutive helices are adjacent and antiparallel; it is approximately equivalent to the meander topology of a beta-sheet.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Crossover connection” links secondary structures at the opposite ends of the structural core and goes across the surface of the domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Greek-key” is a topology for a small number of beta sheet strands in which some interstrand connections going across the end of barrel or, in a sandwich fold, between beta sheets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Jelly-roll” is a variant of Greek key topology with both ends of a sandwich or a barrel fold being crossed by two interstrand connections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“All-alpha” class has the number of secondary structures in the domain or common core described as 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or multi-helical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Bundle” is an array of alpha-helices each oriented roughly along the same (bundle) axis. It may have twist, left-handed if each helix makes a positive angle to the bundle axis, or be right-handed if each helix makes a negative angle to the bundle axis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Folded leaf” is a layer of alpha-helices wrapped around a single hydrophobic core but not with the simple geometry of a bundle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Array” (of hairpins) is an assembly of alpha-helices that can not be described as a bundle or a folded leaf.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Closed”, “partly opened” and “opened” for all-alpha structures describes the extent in which the hydrophobic core is screened by the comprising alpha-helices. “Opened” means that there is space for at least one more helix to be easily attached to the core.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBeta-sheets can be “antiparallel” (i.e. the strand direction in any two adjacent strands are antiparallel), “parallel” (all strands are parallel each other) or “mixed” (there is one strand at least that is parallel to one of its two neighbours and antiparallel to the other).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“All-beta” class includes two major fold groups: sandwiches and barrels. The “sandwich” folds are made of two beta-sheets which are usually twisted and pack so their strands are aligned. The “barrel” fold are made of single beta-sheet that twists and coils upon itself so, in most cases, the first strand in the beta sheet hydrogen bond to the last strand. The strand directions in the two opposite sides of a barrel fold are roughly orthogonal. Orthogonal packing of sheets is also seen in a few special cases of sandwich folds\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Barrel structures” are usually closed by main-chain hydrogen bonds between the first and last strands of the beta sheet, in this case it is defined by the two integer numbers: the number of strand in the beta sheet, n, and a measure of the extent the extent to which the strands in the sheet are staggered the shear number, S.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Partly open barrel” has the edge strands not properly hydrogen bonded because one of the strands is in two parts connected with a linker of more than one residue. These edge strands can be treated as a single but interrupted strand, allowing classification with the effective strand and shear numbers, n* and S*. In the few open barrels the beta sheets are connected by only a few side-chain hydrogen bonds between the edge strands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is likely that there exists a bias in nature towards particular folds, simply because of the evolutionary constraints applied to protein structure and function determination. For example, approximately 30% of folds and 50% of protein superfamilies are contained within about 4-5 architectures, in particular αβ-sandwiches (two- and three-layer), αβ-barrel, β-barrel, α-updown structures (see Orengo et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem. 74, 867-900, 2005). Many folds are also reported as sharing common structural motifs due to the recurrence of simple structural motifs e.g., αβ-motifs, ββ-motifs, split βαβ-motifs. Nearly 80 different folds are classified as adopting a three-layer αβ-sandwich architecture, and the most highly-populated fold groups adopt regular architectures (e.g., TIM barrel fold, αβ-barrel, Rossman fold; three-layer, αβ-sandwich; αβ-plait, two-layer αβ-sandwich) that may be more stable when mutated (Orengo et al., ibid.). Recent statistical analyses suggest that more highly-represented folds i.e., “superfolds” support a much broader repertoire of primary sequences than other folds (Shakhnovich et al., J. Mol. Biol. 326, 1-9, 2003). For example, the CATH database provides a hierarchical classification of domains, within protein structures, in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; Berman et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 28, 235-242, 2000). There are about 32 architectures described in the CATH database.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5. Peptide Sources\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for producing libraries encoding peptides that correspond to naturally-occurring protein domains and/or sub-domains and/or are capable of forming secondary and/or super-secondary structures are known e.g., as described in International Patent Publication Nos. WO/2004/074479 (International Application No. PCT/AU2004/000214) and WO/2007/097923 (International Application No. PCT/AU2007/097923). The contents of these applications are incorporated herein in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, nucleic acid fragments comprising genomic DNA, cDNA, or amplified nucleic acid derived from one or two or more well-characterized genomes e.g., a prokaryote genome or a eukaryote having a small genome such as a protist, dinoflagellate, alga, plant, fungus, mould, invertebrate or vertebrate may be employed to produce an expression library. Such nucleic acid fragments are derived, for example, from one or two or more of \nAeropyrum pernix, Aquifex aeolicus, Archaeoglobus fulgidis, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella pertussis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Methanococcus jannaschii, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pyrococcus horikoshii, Synechocystis \nPCC 6803, \nThermoplasma volcanium \nand \nThermotoga maritima\n. The nucleic acid fragments are generated using art-recognized methods e.g., mechanical shearing, digestion with a nuclease, digestion with a restriction endonuclease, amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using random oligonucleotide primers, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid fragments are inserted into a suitable expression vector or gene construct in operable connection with a suitable promoter for expression of an encoded peptide in each clone. One approach employs site-specific recombinases to integrate fragments comprising one or two flanking recombination sites into a plasmid vector having compatible recombination sites. Site-specific recombination systems typically comprise one or more proteins that recognize a specific recombination site sequence in a plasmid vector and in the DNA insert, cleave the nucleic acids and ligate them together via cross-over event(s). Several site-specific recombinases are known in the art e.g., the bacteriophage P1 Cre/lox system (Austin et al. \nCell\n 25, 729-736, 1981), the R/RS recombinase system from the pSR1 plasmid of the yeast \nZygosaccharomyces rouxii \n(Araki et al., J. Mol. Biol. 182, 191-203, 1985), the Gin/gix system of phage Mu (Maeser et al., Mol. Gen. Genet. 230, 170-176, 1991), the FLP/FRT recombinase system from the 2 micron plasmid of the yeast \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae \n(Broach et al., Cell 29, 227-234, 1982), and the Integrase from bacteriophage Lambda (Landy et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem. 58, 912-949, 1989; Landy et al., Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 3, 699-707, 1993; Lorbach et al., J. Mol. Biol. 296, 1175-1181, 2000; and WO 01/16345). The integrase system utilizes attachment sites (attB, attP, attL, attR) to facilitate integration of insert nucleic acid into vector, wherein attB sites recombine with attP sites in a reaction mediated by an integrase enzyme to yield attL and attR sites on resulting “entry” plasmid vectors. The DNA inserts are then mobilized into a suitable “destination” expression plasmid by recombination between attL sites and attR sites in a reaction mediated by an integrase enzyme to yield attB and attP sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerine recombinase systems e.g., Sin resolvase system, are also known in the art to provide for recombination between donor and acceptor sites in DNA for cloning purposes. For example, the \nMycobacterium tuberculosis \nprophage-like element ΦRv1 encodes a site-specific recombination system utilizing an integrase of the serine recombinase family, wherein recombination occurs between a putative attP site and the host chromosome, but is unusual in that the attB site lies within a redundant repetitive element (REP13E12) of which there are seven copies in the \nM. tuberculosis \ngenome; and wherein four of these repetitive elements contain attB sites suitable for ΦRv1 integration in vivo. Although the mechanism of directional control of large serine integrases is poorly understood, a recombination directionality factor (RDF) has been identified that is required for ΦRv1 integrase-mediated excisive recombination in vivo. Defined in vitro recombination reactions for both ΦRv1 integrase-mediated integration and excision require the ΦRv1 RDF for excision, but not DNA supercoiling, host factors, or high-energy cofactors (unlike the lambda integrase system). Integration, excision and excise-mediated inhibition of integration require simple substrates sites, indicating that the control of directionality does not involve the manipulation of higher-order protein-DNA architectures as described for the tyrosine integrases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the construct used for expression is determined by the system(s) that will be used to display the encoded peptides for screening purposes e.g., by direct display on a physical medium or by phage display or recombinant expression. Such display generally provides for the peptides to assume a secondary or super-secondary structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, peptide libraries are produced based on source data comprising annotations of primary sequences determined and/or predicted structures for proteins from which the component peptides are derived. For example, source data consisting of protein sequence resources such as PRINTS, Pfam, SMART, Propom, InterPro, TIGRFAMs, ADDA, CHOP, ProtoNet, SYSTERS, iProClass, SWISSPROT, COG/KOG, and protein structure family resources such as CAMPASS (Cambridge University, UK), CATH database (University College, London, UK), CE (SDSC, La Jolla, Calif., USA), DHS (University College, London, UK), ENTREZ/MMDB (NCBI, Bethesda Md., USA), Structural Classification of Protein Database (SCOP) (Andreeva et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 32:D226-D229, 2004), or the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 28: 235, 2000) are used to determine amino acid sequences capable of independently-forming secondary structures and/or assemblies of secondary structures and/or folds suitable for practical application in drug screening. In such an approach, synthetic peptides are produced having the sequences that are capable of forming those secondary structures and super-secondary structures, or alternatively, nucleic acid encoding the amino acid sequences are synthesized and cloned into suitable expression vectors as described herein above. As with libraries produced from genomic fragments, peptide libraries produced using bioinformatics data must be displayed for the purposes of screening to ascertain their bioactivity. Again, display generally provides for the peptides to assume a secondary or super-secondary structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the foregoing methods, each clone of the library encodes, on average, a monomeric peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable display methods for peptide libraries include e.g., arraying the peptides on a solid surface, e.g., a microarray, or on a plurality of solid surfaces, e.g., a plurality of beads, or in microwells. The peptides may be synthesized directly onto a solid surface or immobilized on a solid surface. For example, a parallel array or pool of peptides can be produced by synthetic means and arrayed in a multi-well plate for high-throughput screening. Peptides can also be displayed using recombinant means e.g., by virtue of being expressed on the surface of a phage or a cell or by ribosome display or by in vitro display or within cells. In such methods, peptides are generally displayed (and subsequently screened) as monomers.\n\n\n \nModulators of CD40/CD40L Signaling\n\n\n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies that block the interaction of CD40L with its cognate CD40 receptor to prevent allograft rejection in primates have been described e.g., Kirk et al., Nature Med. 5, 686-693 (1999). Such immunotherapy has also been reported for therapy of animal models of diabetes e.g., Kover et al., Diabetes 49, 1666-1670 (2000) and atherosclerosis e.g., Mach et al., Nature 394, 200-203 (1998). CD40L immunotherapy carries a high incidence of adverse consequences such as thromboembolic complications e.g., Boumpas et al., Arthrtitis Rheum. 48, 719-727 (2003), possibly due to the induction of Fc-mediated platelet aggregation e.g., Langer et al., Thromb Haemost 93, 1137-1146 (2005); Mirabet et al., Mol. Immunol. 45, 937-944 (2008).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA peptide derived from the native CD40-CD40L interface i.e., residues 181-205 of CD40L and a retro-inverso peptide analog thereof are described by Allen et al., J. Peptide Res. 65, 591-604 (2005). The term “native interface” or “native CD40-CD40L interface” or similar means that the peptide comprises a linear sequence of one of the binding partners i.e., CD40 or CD40L that is involved in their interaction, or a reverse sequence thereof e.g., a sequence of a retro-inverted analog. For example, the peptide described by Allen et al. (2005) comprises R203 of CD40L known to be involved in binding to CD40 and flanking sequence. The peptide and its chiral analog were reported to block T-cell proliferation in vitro, and to reduce incidence and severity of experimental encephalomyelitis (EAE) when administered to mice. There are a limited number of primary or secondary or tertiary structure permutations derivable the native interaction interface of CD40 and CD40L, thereby limiting the range of available therapeutics for ameliorating the adverse consequences of CD40-signaling through CD40L.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore recently, phage-expressed 7-mer peptide aptamers that had been disulfide-constrained by cyclization through their N-terminal and C-terminal cysteine residues, have also been described to bind to CD40L in vitro, and a single peptide thereof shown to inhibit CD40-mediated B-cell activation, Ig switching, endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis e.g., Deambrosis et al., J. Mol. Med. 87, 181-197 (2009). As with strategies for peptidomimetics based on the native CD40-CD40L interface, strategies employing disulfide-constrained aptamers of fixed length form a limited number of secondary or tertiary structure permutations, thereby limiting the range of available therapeutics for ameliorating the adverse consequences of CD40-signaling through CD40L. This conclusion is supported by the low primary hit rate in aptamer screens for binding activity and/or high attrition rate of aptamers tested for inhibitory activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is an ongoing need for compounds that ameliorate the adverse effects of CD40L signaling events, including those events mediated by CD40 and/or Mac-1. Inverse agonists and antagonists of CD40L would be particularly useful for providing such benefits.\n\n\n \nGeneral\n\n\n \n \n \nConventional techniques of molecular biology, microbiology, virology, recombinant DNA technology, peptide synthesis in solution, solid phase peptide synthesis, and immunology are described, for example, in the following texts that are incorporated by reference:\n\n \n \n \nSambrook, Fritsch & Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, New York, Second Edition (1989), whole of Vols I, II, and III;\n \nDNA Cloning: A Practical Approach, Vols.

Introduction\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides peptidyl and non-peptidyl compositions that bind to CD40L (CD154) and/or prevent, reduce or inhibit CD40L from interacting with CD40 and/or modulate CD40 signaling and/or modulate CD40L signalling. The invention also relates to the use of such compositions in medicine. In one example, a composition of the present invention is for use in a method of diagnosis and/or prognosis and/or prophylaxis and/or therapy of the human or animal body. In another example, a composition of the present invention is for use or in an ex vivo method of diagnosis and/or prognosis and/or prophylaxis and/or therapy of the human or animal body. In another example, a composition of the present invention is for use in an in vivo or ex vivo method, such as a method of diagnosis and/or prognosis and/or prophylaxis and/or therapy, to ameliorate one or more adverse effects or consequences of CD40L signaling and/or CD40 signaling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is based in part upon the identification by the inventors of compositions e.g., peptides and derivatives and analogs thereof that bind to CD40L e.g., at IC\n50 \nless than about 500 nM, and/or competitively antagonize or inhibit the interaction between CD40L and its cognate receptor CD40, and/or selectively inhibit or reduce CD40L-mediated expression of CD86 on primary B-cells and/or selectively antagonize or inhibit CD40L-mediated T-cell proliferation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides of the present invention are expressed from fragments of prokaryotic and compact eukaryotic genomes, not all of which are native open reading frames of those genomes. The peptides of the present invention are also not aptamers or peptide fragments derived from the native CD40-CD40L interface. For example, the peptides may have no known function or be derived from proteins having functions distinct from CD40 or CD40L. Accordingly, the peptides of the invention do not modulate CD40L-mediated events e.g., when expressed in their native contexts i.e., in the proteins in which they are expressed in nature. Alternatively, or in addition, the peptides of the present invention do not comprise N-terminal and C-terminal flanking cysteine residues, e.g., for conformational stability, as distinct from peptide aptamers. For example, the peptides of the present invention have lengths sufficient to form a secondary structure or super-secondary structure e.g., autonomously, such as without the need for flanking N-terminal and C-terminal cysteines to achieve their cyclization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “CD40L antagonist”, “CD40L peptidyl inhibitor” or “CD40L peptide inhibitor” or “CD40L inhibitor” or similar term shall be taken to mean a composition of the invention that binds to CD40L and inhibits or reduces or delays one or more CD40L-dependent effects in vitro or in vivo, e.g., a peptidyl inhibitor that binds to CD40L and inhibits one or more CD40L-mediated effects such as CD40L-mediated signaling, including CD40-CD40L costimulatory effects such as downstream effect(s) of CD40L-dependent CD40-mediated signaling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is also based on the inventors' understanding that, in general, the serum half-life of a peptide of less than about 50-100 amino acids in length may be short, and that such a peptide may have lower affinity than desirable for pharmaceutical applications. The inventors reasoned that the half-life and/or the affinity of binding between a small peptide and its target may be enhanced inter alia by producing peptide derivatives and analogs such as: (i) a derivative having enhance entropy (e.g., PEGylated and/or HESylated and/or polyglycinated and/or multimeric forms of one or more base peptides having a desired activity); and/or (ii) a derivative comprising a “serum protein moiety” e.g., albumin or ferritin or transferrin or immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin fragment e.g., domain antibody (dAb) or modified Fc component of immunoglobulin lacking effector function or Fc-disable immunoglobulin such as a CovXBody; and/or (iii) a derivative comprising a “serum protein-binding moiety” e.g., albumin-binding peptide, albumin-binding domain (ABD or Affybody) or serum albumin-binding antibody domain (AlbudAb) that binds to albumin or immunoglobulin (Ig) or Ig fragment such as Fc; and/or (iv) an analog comprising D-amino acids e.g., a retro-peptide analog or retro-inverso analog of one or more base peptides and/or derivatives according to any example hereof and having a desired activity. For example, a derivatives or analog of a CD40L peptide inhibitor may have enhanced CD40L inhibitory activity and/or serum half-life compared to a corresponding base peptide from which it has been derived.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, one example of the present invention provides a PEGylated peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signaling. In another example, the present invention provides a HESylated peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signaling. In another example, the present invention provides a polyglycinated peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signaling. In another example, the present invention provides a composition comprising a peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signalling as described according to any example hereof and a serum protein moiety as described according to any example hereof. In another example, the present invention provides a composition comprising a peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signalling as described according to any example hereof and a peptidyl serum protein-binding moiety as described according to any example hereof. In another example, the present invention provides a composition comprising a peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signalling as described according to any example hereof and a non-peptidyl serum protein-binding moiety as described according to any example hereof e.g., a hapten that binds to an Fc-disabled antibody, polyethylene glycol, hydroxyethyl starch (HES), polyglycine, a 4,4-diphenylcyclohexyl moiety or 4-phenylbutanoic acid moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of the present invention provides a PEGylated chiral analog of a peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signalling as described according to any example hereof. In another example, the present invention provides a HESylated chiral analog of a peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signaling as described according to any example hereof. In another example, the present invention provides a polyglycinated chiral analog of a peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signaling as described according to any example hereof. In another example, the present invention provides a composition comprising a chiral analog of a peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signalling as described according to any example hereof and a serum protein moiety as described according to any example hereof wherein the serum protein moiety may itself be a chiral analog such as by comprising D-amino acids, or it may comprise L-amino acids. In another example, the present invention provides a composition comprising a chiral analog of a peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signalling as described according to any example hereof and a peptidyl serum protein-binding moiety as described according to any example hereof, wherein the serum protein-binding moiety may itself be a chiral analog such as by comprising D-amino acids, or it may comprise L-amino acids. In another example, the present invention provides a composition comprising a chiral analog of a peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signalling as described according to any example hereof and a non-peptidyl serum protein-binding moiety e.g., a hapten that binds to Fc, polyethylene glycol, hydroxyethyl starch (HES), polyglycine, a 4,4-diphenylcyclohexyl moiety or 4-phenylbutanoic acid moiety e.g., conjugated to D-lysine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides compositions comprising cysteine-free peptidyl inhibitors of CD40L-dependent signalling, wherein the peptidyl inhibitor moiety lacks cysteine residues e.g., by virtue of substitution of cysteine for another amino acid such as serine. Such compositions may be PEGylated, HESylated, polyglycinated, multimerized, or comprise serum protein moiety or serum protein-binding moiety with or without intervening spacer as described according to any example hereof, and they may be chiral analogs according to any example hereof e.g., retroinverted analogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a multimeric peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signaling. As used in this context, the term “multimeric peptidyl inhibitor” shall be taken to mean that the composition comprises two or more peptidyl inhibitors that each inhibit CD40L-dependent signalling in their monomeric form. In one example, homodimers and heterodimers have enhanced inhibitory activity compared to a monomeric peptide from which it is derived e.g., with respect to CD40L binding to CD40 and/or inhibition of CD40L binding to a cognate binding partner such as CD40 or Mac-1 and/or inhibition of one or more CD40L-dependent effects such as B-cell proliferation or T-cell proliferation. For example, the effect of multimerization is more than the additive effect of either base peptide. A multimeric peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signaling may be PEGylated, HESylated, polyglycinated, multimerized, or comprise a serum protein moiety or a serum protein-binding moiety with or without intervening spacer as described according to any example hereof, and may be a chiral analog according to any example hereof e.g., a retroinverted analog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, another example of the present invention provides a PEGylated peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signalling or a PEGylated multimeric peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signaling, wherein the peptidyl inhibitor lacks cysteine residues e.g., by virtue of substitution of cysteine for another amino acid such as serine, or comprises a single N-terminal or C-terminal cysteine residue. In yet another example, the present invention provides a PEGylated chiral analog of a peptidyl inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signaling, wherein the peptidyl inhibitors lack cysteine residues e.g., by virtue of substitution of cysteine for another amino acid such as serine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also extends to the production and/or use of recombinant combinatorial proteins comprising pluralities of the peptides, derivatives and analogs described according to any example of the invention herein, e.g., recombinantly-produced peptidomimetics comprising one or more protein sub-domains, domains, folds, secondary structures or super-secondary structures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also extends to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the synthetic and recombinant peptide-based i.e., “peptidyl” CD40L-binding compositions described according to any examples hereof, and to the use of such compositions in medicine and/or pharmacy. For example, the peptides and any analogs or derivatives thereof may be formulated with a suitable carrier or excipient e.g., for injection or inhalation or oral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also extends to non-peptidyl equivalents of the exemplified peptides, peptidyl analogs and peptidyl derivatives provided herein, and to compositions comprising same and methods for their production and/or use in medicine and/or pharmacy. For example, the non-peptidyl equivalents may be formulated with a suitable carrier or excipient e.g., for injection or inhalation or oral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also extends to diagnostic, prognostic, prophylactic, therapeutic and research applications of the peptides and compositions of the invention described herein.\n\n\n \n2. General\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “derived from” shall be taken to indicate that a specified integer may be obtained from a particular source albeit not necessarily directly from that source.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word “comprise”, or variations such as “comprises” or “comprising”, will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated step or element or integer or group of steps or elements or integers but not the exclusion of any other step or element or integer or group of elements or integers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout this specification, unless specifically stated otherwise or the context requires otherwise, reference to a single step, composition of matter, group of steps or group of compositions of matter shall be taken to encompass one and a plurality (i.e. one or more) of those steps, compositions of matter, groups of steps or group of compositions of matter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach embodiment described herein is to be applied mutatis mutandis to each and every other embodiment unless specifically stated otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention described herein is susceptible to variations and modifications other than those specifically described. It is to be understood that the invention includes all such variations and modifications. The invention also includes all of the steps, features, compositions and compounds referred to or indicated in this specification, individually or collectively, and any and all combinations or any two or more of said steps or features.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific examples described herein, which are intended for the purpose of exemplification only. Functionally-equivalent products, compositions and methods are clearly within the scope of the invention, as described herein.\n\n\n \n3. Specific Examples\n\n\n \n \n \nThe scope of the invention will be apparent from the claims as filed with the application, which are hereby incorporated into the description. The scope of the invention will also be apparent from the following specific examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne example of the present invention provides a composition comprising one or more peptides, wherein a peptide of the composition comprises a sequence of amino acids other than a sequence of CD40, wherein the peptide binds to CD40 ligand (CD40L) and partially or completely inhibits interaction of CD40 with CD40L and one or more CD40-CD40L costimulatory effects. The peptide that binds to CD40L and partially or completely inhibits interaction of CD40 with CD40L and one or more CD40-CD40L costimulatory effects is a peptidomimetic or other composition not derived from the sequence of CD40 or other binding partner of CD40L e.g., Mac-1, and does not comprise a sequence of CD40 or other binding partner. For example, the peptide is not derived from the native Cd40-Cd40L interface and does not comprise a sequence thereof. In one example, the peptide comprises a sequence encoded by a nucleic acid fragment of a prokaryote genome or a compact eukaryote genome e.g., the peptide comprises a sequence of a natural open reading frame of a prokaryote genome or a compact eukaryote genome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the peptide that binds to CD40L and partially or completely inhibits interaction of CD40 with CD40L and one or more CD40-CD40L costimulatory effects does not comprise both N-terminal and C-terminal cysteine residues for achieving conformational stability e.g., by virtue of disulfide bridge formation leading to cyclic peptide formation, which cyclic peptide formation may be advantageous for aptamer functionality. In another example, the peptide of the present invention comprises a single C-terminal or N-terminal cysteine residue. In another example, the peptide is cysteine-free.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the peptide that binds CD40L and partially or completely inhibits interaction of CD40 with CD40L and one or more CD40-CD40L costimulatory effects comprises one or more non-naturally-occurring amino acids e.g., one or more D amino acids. For example, the peptide is an isostere or a chiral analog such as a retroinverso-peptide analog (i.e., a retro-inverted peptide).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the peptide that binds to CD40L and partially or completely inhibits interaction of CD40 with CD40L and one or more CD40-CD40L costimulatory effects is a peptidyl-fusion. As used herein, the term “peptidyl fusion” means a peptide comprising two or more peptidyl moieties or sub-units linked covalently or non-covalently, with or without intervening linker or spacer moieties separating the peptidyl moieties. Preferred peptidyl fusions comprise two or more peptidyl moieties linked covalently e.g., by means of oxime chemistry or peptide synthesis or recombinant protein synthesis. For example, the peptidyl fusion may comprise a plurality of smaller peptides that each bind CD40L, wherein the peptidyl-fusion has a higher affinity for CD40L and/or enhanced inhibitory activity than a single peptide of the peptidyl-fusion. These smaller peptides that each bind CD40L may be the same or comprise the same sequence or secondary structure, or they may be structurally different e.g., with respect to their primary amino acid sequences or with respect to their secondary structures. For example, the peptidyl-fusion may be a dimer e.g., a homodimer or heterodimer comprising two peptides that each bind CD40L and partially or completely inhibits interaction of CD40 with CD40L and one or more CD40-CD40L costimulatory effects. In another example, a peptidyl-fusion is between a peptide that binds CD40L and a serum protein-binding moiety, or between a peptide that binds CD40L and a protein transduction domain, or between a peptide that binds CD40L and a serum protein-binding moiety. Peptidyl fusions comprising any combination of one or more peptides of the invention that bind CD40L and one or more other moieties e.g., a serum protein-binding moiety and/or a protein transduction domain and/or a serum protein-binding moiety, are also encompassed by the invention. As with base peptides, peptidyl fusions of the present invention may include one or more D-amino acids, and be isosteres or chiral analogs of peptides comprising L-amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides, peptidyl fusions, isosteres and chiral analogs of the invention as described according to any example hereof may further comprise a polyethylene glycol (PEG) residue i.e., they may be PEGylated compositions. For example, the invention provides a peptide that binds to CD40L and partially or completely inhibits interaction of CD40 with CD40L and one or more CD40-CD40L costimulatory effects, wherein the peptide comprises a PEGylated peptide having L-amino acids or a PEGylated chiral analog thereof wherein all amino acids other than glycine have been substituted for D-amino acids. The PEGylated peptides and analogs may lack N-terminal and C-terminal cysteines or they may be cysteine-free.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the present invention provides a composition comprising a peptide that binds to CD40L and partially or completely inhibits interaction of CD40 with CD40L and one or more CD40-CD40L costimulatory effects, wherein the peptide comprises a sequence selected individually or collectively from the group consisting of:\n\n \n \n \n(i) a sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 34 or 44;\n \n(ii) the sequence of a functional fragment of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 34 or 44;\n \n(iii) the sequence of a peptidyl fusion comprising a plurality of sequences at (i) or (ii), optionally wherein at least one of said plurality is separated by a spacer or linker molecule;\n \n(iv) the sequence of (i) or (ii) or (iii) additionally comprising a protein transduction domain, e.g., a HIV tat basic region or a retroinverted analog thereof and/or a serum protein-binding moiety, optionally wherein said peptide is separated from the protein transduction domain and/or serum protein-binding moiety by a spacer or said protein transduction domain and/or serum protein-binding moiety are separated by one or more spacers; and\n \n(v) an analog of any one of (i) to (iv) selected from the group consisting of (a) the sequence of any one of (i) to (iv) comprising one or more non-naturally-occurring amino acids; (b) the sequence of any one of (i) to (iv) comprising one or more non-naturally-occurring amino acid analogs; (c) an isostere of any one of (i) to (iv); (d) a retro-peptide analog of any one of (i) to (iv); and (e) a retro-inverted peptide analog of any one of (i) to (iv).\n \n\n\n \n \n \nFor the purposes of nomenclature, the sequences set forth in SEQ ID Nos: 1 to 44 are representative peptides of the present invention that bind to CD40L and inhibit the interaction of CD40 with a cognate receptor e.g., CD40, and inhibit downstream signaling from CD40L including costimulatory CD40-CD40L signaling e.g., B-cell proliferation such as determined by CD86 expression levels, and T-cell proliferation. Additional specific examples of such peptidyl inhibitors of the present invention are to be found e.g., in Australian Patent Application No. 2008903552 filed Jul. 11, 2009, the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety. It will also be apparent from Example 1 hereof that such peptidyl inhibitors include specific examples of cysteine-free peptides and peptidyl fusions, and retroinverted peptides, in both unmodified form and as PEGylated peptides and peptidyl fusions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further example of the present invention provides a phagemid vector or cell capable of expressing a peptide or peptidyl fusion of the present invention as described according to any example hereof comprising naturally-occurring amino acids or otherwise capable of being expressed by cellular translational machinery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA still further example of the present invention provides an isolated nucleic acid comprising a sequence that encodes a peptide or peptidyl fusion of the present invention as described according to any example hereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the composition of the present invention is suitable for administration to a human or non-human animal. For example, the composition is formulated so as to comprise the active peptidyl agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the composition is a liquid pharmaceutical formulation comprising a buffer in an amount to maintain the pH of the formulation in a range of about pH 5.0 to about pH 7.0. In a further example, the pharmaceutical composition comprises an isotonizing agent in an amount to render same composition near isotonic. Exemplary isotonizing agents include sodium chloride e.g., present in said formulation at a concentration of about 50 mM to about 300 mM, or at a concentration of about 150 mM. Exemplary buffers are selected from the group consisting of succinate, citrate, and phosphate buffers e.g., at a concentration of about 1 mM to about 50 mM. For example, a sodium succinate or sodium citrate buffer at a concentration of about 5 mM to about 15 mM may be employed. In another example, the formulation further comprises a surfactant in an amount from about 0.001% to about 1.0% e.g., \npolysorbate\n 80 which may be present in said formulation in an amount from about 0.001% to about 0.5%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions may be formulated for administration by injection, inhalation, ingestion or topically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the formulation is for inhalation and the subject peptide is present in an amount suitable for administration by inhalation and the carrier or excipient is one suitable for inhalation. Inhalable formulations e.g., comprising an alkyl-saccharide transmucosal delivery-enhancing excipient such as Intraveil (Aegis Therapeutics) are preferred for prophylactic applications e.g., for administration to an asymptomatic subject at risk of developing a condition associated with CD40L signaling or a complication associated therewith e.g., an asymptomatic subject having one or more risk factors for a condition associated with CD40L signaling supra, and/or an asymptomatic subject exposed to an infectious agent, poison, allergen or irritant of the airways that is a risk factor for development of a condition associated with CD40L signaling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “asymptomatic subject” is meant a subject that does not exhibit one or more symptoms of a condition associated with CD40L signaling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the formulation is for injection and the subject peptide is present in an amount suitable for administration by injection e.g., subcutaneously, intravenously, intraperitoneally or intramuscularly, and the carrier or excipient is one suitable for injection e.g., subcutaneously, intravenously, intraperitoneally or intramuscularly. Injectable formulations are preferred for acute phase a condition associated with CD40L signaling or complications associated therewith or where the subject has difficulty inhaling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that it is a preferred embodiment for the peptidyl formulations of the present invention to have CD40L signaling inhibitory activity conferred by the peptide component or peptide analog component of such formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulation may be packaged for multiple administrations e.g., it may be packaged as multiple injectable ampoules, capsules, etc. for repeated administration or repeated dosing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CD40L signaling inhibitor may be a peptidyl or non-peptidyl composition. Suitable peptidyl compounds will be any one or more of the peptides described herein above, or alternatively a different peptide or antibody composition that inhibits CD40L signaling e.g., as described in the ensuing Detailed Description. Suitable non-peptidyl compounds will be apparent to the skilled artisan based on the description herein, and include, for example, a nucleic acid, or a small molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgain, the present invention clearly encompasses formulations comprising mixtures of peptides or peptide analogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, a peptide or analog as described herein above or a peptidyl CD40L signaling inhibitor, is conjugated to or fused to a protein transduction domain. A suitable protein transduction domain will be apparent to the skilled artisan based on the description herein and includes a HIV-tat basic region peptide or a retroinverted analog thereof. Another suitable protein transduction domain is a Kaposi fibroblast growth factor (FGF) hydrophobic peptide protein transduction domain or a retro-inverted analog thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled artisan will be aware that an amount of the active ingredient will vary, e.g., as a result of variation in the bioactivity of an inhibitor, and/or the severity of the condition being treated. Accordingly, the term “amount” is not to be construed to limit the invention to a specific quantity, e.g., weight of active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “suitable carrier or excipient” shall be taken to mean a compound or mixture thereof that is suitable for use in a formulation albeit not necessarily limited in use to that context. In contrast, the term “a carrier or excipient” is compound or mixture thereof that is described in the art only with reference to a use in a formulation. The term “carrier or excipient for inhalation” shall be taken to mean a compound or mixture thereof that is suitable for use in a formulation to be administered to a subject by inhalation e.g., a formulation comprising an alkyl-saccharide transmucosal delivery-enhancing excipient such as Intraveil (Aegis Therapeutics). The term “carrier or excipient for injection” shall be taken to mean a compound or mixture thereof that is suitable for use in a formulation to be administered to a subject by injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA carrier or excipient useful in the formulation of the present invention will generally not inhibit to any significant degree a relevant biological activity of the active compound e.g., the carrier or excipient will not significantly inhibit the activity of the active compound with respect to reducing neutrophilic inflammation. Alternatively, or in addition, the carrier or excipient comprises a compound that enhances uptake and/or delivery and/or efficacy of the active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, or in addition, the carrier or excipient comprises a compound that enhances the activity of a peptide or analog as described herein above or, more generally, an CD40L signaling inhibitor and/or reduces inhibition of said peptide or analog or CD40L signaling inhibitor by degradative enzymes in the site of administration and/or en route to the site of action of a subject and or at the site of action. For example, the carrier or excipient may comprise a protease inhibitor and/or a DNase inhibitor and/or an RNase inhibitor to thereby enhance the stability of a peptide or analog as described herein above or a peptidyl CD40L signaling inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the formulation as described herein according to any embodiment comprises an additional compound, such as, for example, a corticosterioid to further enhance the efficacy of the peptide or analog e.g., in anti-inflammatory applications. Suitable additional compounds will be apparent to the skilled artisan based on the description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method for producing a formulation described herein according to any embodiment.

The peptidyl or non-peptidyl inhibitor may prevent or reduce the ability of CD40L to bind to CD40 and mediate one or more CD40-dependent signaling events. For example, a peptidyl inhibitor capable of binding to CD40L and reducing or preventing CD40-CD40L interaction will inhibit CD40-mediated Cd86 expression and/or one or more downstream CD86-mediated events. In another example, a peptidyl inhibitor capable of binding to CD40L and reducing or preventing CD40-CD40L interaction will inhibit or reduce CD40L-mediated T-cell proliferation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “CD40 signaling” shall be taken to mean one or more downstream pathway steps or effects mediated by CD40 and dependent on CD40L binding to CD40. The term “CD40L-dependent CD40-mediated” also refers to CD40 signaling as defined herein. For example, a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention may modulate e.g., antagonize CD40 signaling by virtue of preventing CD40 from binding to CD40L.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “CD40L signaling” shall be taken to mean one or more downstream pathway steps or effects mediated by CD40L whether or not binding to the cognate CD40 receptor is involved. For example, a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention may modulate e.g., antagonize CD40L signaling that does not involve CD40, by virtue of binding directly to CD40L, or alternatively, a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention may modulate e.g., antagonize CD40L signaling that does involve CD40, by virtue of preventing CD40 from binding to CD40L.\n\n\n \n \n1. Peptidyl Inhibitors of CD40 and/or CD40L Signaling\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA peptidyl inhibitor described herein may be a base peptide or derivative or analog according to any example hereof, that functions as a CD40 signaling inhibitor and/or a CD40L signaling inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “base peptide” refers to a peptide in an unmodified form that possesses a stated inhibitory activity or binding activity, especially CD40L-binding activity and/or CD40L-signaling inhibitory activity and/or CD40-signaling inhibitory activity e.g., by virtue or preventing an interaction between CD40L and CD40 that activates the CD40:CD40L costimulatory pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “derivative” or “analog” in the context of a peptidyl inhibitor refers broadly to a peptide in a modified form that possesses a stated inhibitory activity or binding activity, especially CD40L-binding activity and/or CD40L-signaling inhibitory activity and/or CD40-signaling inhibitory activity e.g., by virtue or preventing an interaction between CD40L and CD40 that activates the CD40:CD40L costimulatory pathway.\n\n\n \nPeptide Synthesis\n\n\n \n \n \nA peptide or an analog or derivative thereof is preferably synthesized using a chemical method known to the skilled artisan. For example, synthetic peptides are prepared using known techniques of solid phase, liquid phase, or peptide condensation, or any combination thereof, and can include natural and/or unnatural amino acids. Amino acids used for peptide synthesis may be standard Boc (Nα-amino protected Nα-t-butyloxycarbonyl) amino acid resin with the deprotecting, neutralization, coupling and wash protocols of the original solid phase procedure of Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 85:2149-2154, 1963, or the base-labile Nα-amino protected 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) amino acids described by Carpino and Han, J. Org. Chem., 37:3403-3409, 1972. Both Fmoc and Boc Nα-amino protected amino acids can be obtained from various commercial sources, such as, for example, Fluka, Bachem, Advanced Chemtech, Sigma, Cambridge Research Biochemical, Bachem, or Peninsula Labs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, chemical synthesis methods comprise the sequential addition of one or more amino acids to a growing peptide chain. Normally, either the amino or carboxyl group of the first amino acid is protected by a suitable protecting group. The protected or derivatized amino acid can then be either attached to an inert solid support or utilized in solution by adding the next amino acid in the sequence having the complementary (amino or carboxyl) group suitably protected, under conditions that allow for the formation of an amide linkage. The protecting group is then removed from the newly added amino acid residue and the next amino acid (suitably protected) is then added, and so forth. After the desired amino acids have been linked in the proper sequence, any remaining protecting groups (and any solid support, if solid phase synthesis techniques are used) are removed sequentially or concurrently, to render the final polypeptide. By simple modification of this general procedure, it is possible to add more than one amino acid at a time to a growing chain, for example, by coupling (under conditions which do not racemize chiral centers) a protected tripeptide with a properly protected dipeptide to form, after deprotection, a pentapeptide. See, e.g., J. M. Stewart and J. D. Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill. 1984) and G. Barany and R. B. Merrifield, The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology, editors E. Gross and J. Meienhofer, Vol. 2, (Academic Press, New York, 1980), pp. 3-254, for solid phase peptide synthesis techniques; and M. Bodansky, Principles of Peptide Synthesis, (Springer-Verlag, Berlin 1984) and E. Gross and J. Meienhofer, Eds., The Peptides: Analysis. Synthesis. Biology, Vol. 1, for classical solution synthesis. These methods are suitable for synthesis of a peptide of the present invention or an analog or derivative thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical protecting groups include t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz); p-toluenesulfonyl (Tx); 2,4-dinitrophenyl; benzyl (Bzl); biphenylisopropyloxycarboxy-carbonyl, t-amyloxycarbonyl, isobornyloxycarbonyl, o-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, cyclohexyl, isopropyl, acetyl, o-nitrophenylsulfonyl and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical solid supports are cross-linked polymeric supports. These can include divinylbenzene cross-linked-styrene-based polymers, for example, divinylbenzene-hydroxymethylstyrene copolymers, divinylbenzene-chloromethylstyrene copolymers and divinylbenzene-benzhydrylaminopolystyrene copolymers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA peptide, analog or derivative as described herein can also be chemically prepared by other methods such as by the method of simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis.

No. 4,631,211.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be apparent to the skilled artisan based on the description herein, an analog or derivative of a peptide of the invention may comprise D-amino acids, a combination of D- and L-amino acids, and various unnatural amino acids (e.g., α-methyl amino acids, Cα-methyl amino acids, and Nα-methyl amino acids, etc) to convey special properties. Synthetic amino acids include ornithine for lysine, fluorophenylalanine for phenylalanine, and norleucine for leucine or isoleucine. Methods for the synthesis of such peptides will be apparent to the skilled artisan based on the foregoing description.\n\n\n \nRecombinant Peptide Production\n\n\n \n \n \nA peptide or analog or derivative thereof or fusion protein may be produced as a recombinant protein. To facilitate the production of a recombinant peptide or fusion protein nucleic acid encoding same is preferably isolated or synthesized. Typically the nucleic acid encoding the recombinant protein is/are isolated using a known method, such as, for example, amplification (e.g., using PCR or splice overlap extension) or isolated from nucleic acid from an organism using one or more restriction enzymes or isolated from a library of nucleic acids. Methods for such isolation will be apparent to the ordinary skilled artisan and/or described in Ausubel et al (In: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, ISBN 047 150338, 1987), Sambrook et al (In: Molecular Cloning: Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, New York, Third Edition 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor expressing protein by recombinant means, a protein-encoding nucleic acid is placed in operable connection with a promoter or other regulatory sequence capable of regulating expression in a cell-free system or cellular system. For example, nucleic acid comprising a sequence that encodes a peptide is placed in operable connection with a suitable promoter and maintained in a suitable cell for a time and under conditions sufficient for expression to occur. Nucleic acid encoding a peptide inhibitor of CD40L-dependent signaling, including CD40L-dependent CD40-mediated signaling event(s), is described herein or is derived from the publicly available amino acid sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “promoter” is to be taken in its broadest context and includes the transcriptional regulatory sequences of a genomic gene, including the TATA box or initiator element, which is required for accurate transcription initiation, with or without additional regulatory elements (e.g., upstream activating sequences, transcription factor binding sites, enhancers and silencers) that alter expression of a nucleic acid (e.g., a transgene), e.g., in response to a developmental and/or external stimulus, or in a tissue specific manner. In the present context, the term “promoter” is also used to describe a recombinant, synthetic or fusion nucleic acid, or derivative which confers, activates or enhances the expression of a nucleic acid (e.g., a transgene and/or a selectable marker gene and/or a detectable marker gene) to which it is operably linked. Preferred promoters can contain additional copies of one or more specific regulatory elements to further enhance expression and/or alter the spatial expression and/or temporal expression of said nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “in operable connection with”, “in connection with” or “operably linked to” means positioning a promoter relative to a nucleic acid (e.g., a transgene) such that expression of the nucleic acid is controlled by the promoter. For example, a promoter is generally positioned 5′ (upstream) to the nucleic acid, the expression of which it controls. To construct heterologous promoter/nucleic acid combinations (e.g., promoter/nucleic acid encoding a peptide), it is generally preferred to position the promoter at a distance from the gene transcription start site that is approximately the same as the distance between that promoter and the nucleic acid it controls in its natural setting, i.e., the gene from which the promoter is derived. As is known in the art, some variation in this distance can be accommodated without loss of promoter function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nShould it be preferred that a peptide or fusion protein of the invention is expressed in vitro a suitable promoter includes, but is not limited to a T3 or a T7 bacteriophage promoter (Hanes and Plückthun \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n94 4937-4942 1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical expression vectors for in vitro expression or cell-free expression have been described and include, but are not limited to the TNT T7 and TNT T3 systems (Promega), the pEXP1-DEST and pEXP2-DEST vectors (Invitrogen).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical promoters suitable for expression in bacterial cells include, but are not limited to, the lacz promoter, the Ipp promoter, temperature-sensitive λL or λR promoters, T7 promoter, T3 promoter, SP6 promoter or semi-artificial promoters such as the IPTG-inducible tac promoter or lacUV5 promoter. A number of other gene construct systems for expressing the nucleic acid fragment of the invention in bacterial cells are well-known in the art and are described for example, in Ausubel et al (In: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, ISBN 047 150338, 1987), U.S. Pat. No. 5,763,239 (Diversa Corporation) and Sambrook et al (In: Molecular Cloning: Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, New York, Third Edition 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous expression vectors for expression of recombinant polypeptides in bacterial cells and efficient ribosome binding sites have been described, and include, for example, PKC30 (Shimatake and Rosenberg, \nNature \n292, 128, 1981); pKK173-3 (Amann and Brosius, \n \nGene\n \n40, 183, 1985), pET-3 (Studier and Moffat, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n189, 113, 1986); the pCR vector suite (Invitrogen), pGEM-T Easy vectors (Promega), the pL expression vector suite (Invitrogen) the pBAD/TOPO or pBAD/thio—TOPO series of vectors containing an arabinose-inducible promoter (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), the latter of which is designed to also produce fusion proteins with a Trx loop for conformational constraint of the expressed protein; the pFLEX series of expression vectors (Pfizer Inc., CT, USA); the pQE series of expression vectors (QIAGEN, CA, USA), or the pL series of expression vectors (Invitrogen), amongst others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical promoters suitable for expression in viruses of eukaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells include the SV40 late promoter, SV40 early promoter and cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, CMV IE (cytomegalovirus immediate early) promoter amongst others. Preferred vectors for expression in mammalian cells (e.g., 293, COS, CHO, 10T cells, 293T cells) include, but are not limited to, the pcDNA vector suite supplied by Invitrogen, in particular pcDNA 3.1 myc-His-tag comprising the CMV promoter and encoding a C-terminal 6×His and MYC tag; and the retrovirus vector pSRαtkneo (Muller et al., \nMol. Cell. Biol., \n11, 1785, 1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide range of additional host/vector systems suitable for expressing a peptide or fusion protein of the present invention are available publicly, and described, for example, in Sambrook et al (In: Molecular cloning, A laboratory manual, second edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other examples, the peptidyl inhibitor, especially any base peptide, is expressed on by phage display, cell display, or in vitro display.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor in vitro display, the expressed peptide is linked to the nucleic acid from which it was expressed such that said peptide is presented in the absence of a host cell. For example, the peptide is displayed by ribosome display, which directly links mRNA encoded by an expression construct to the peptide that it encodes. To display a nascent polypeptide in vitro, nucleic acid encoding it is cloned downstream of an appropriate promoter (e.g., bacteriophage T3 or T7 promoter) and a ribosome binding sequence, optionally including a translatable spacer nucleic acid (e.g., encoding amino acids 211-299 of gene III of filamentous phage M13 mp19) that stabilizes the expressed fusion protein within the ribosomal tunnel. Ribosome complexes are stabilized against dissociation from the peptide and/or its encoding mRNA by the addition of reagents such as, for example, magnesium acetate or chloroamphenicol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor phage display, the expressed peptide is displayed on the surface of a bacteriophage, as described e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,047 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,190,908. In general, nucleic acid comprising a sequence encoding the peptide is fused N-terminally or C-terminally to nucleic acid comprising a sequence encoding a phage coat protein e.g., M13 protein-3 (p3), M13 protein-7 (p7), or M13, protein-8 (p8).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention is expressed C-terminally in a Fos fusion peptide i.e., as Fos-peptidyl inhibitor fusion in the phagemid vector pJuFo. The vector pJuFo also expresses p3 C-terminally in a c-Jun fusion peptide i.e., as c-Jun-p3. By virtue of the interaction between c-Jun and Fos, the inhibitory peptide of the present invention is displayed from pJuFo in trans as a dimer between the Fos-peptidyl inhibitor and c-Jun-p3 fusion peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention is expressed N-terminally as a p3 or p7 or p8 fusion peptide wherein the C-terminus of the peptide is fused to the N-terminus of p3 or p7 or p8. Nucleic acid encoding the peptidyl inhibitor is cloned into an insertion site in a suitable vector e.g., an EcoRI site or other restriction site, positioned such that the encoded peptidyl inhibitor is expressed as an in-frame fusion with the p3 or p7 or p8 protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA leader sequence e.g., PelB, comprising a translation start codon is generally positioned upstream of the insertion site. Preferably, the vector is configured so as to provide for expression of natural open reading frames in the introduced nucleic acid encoding the peptidyl inhibitor e.g., by ensuring the absence of intervening stop codons between the leader sequence and the p3 or p7 or p8 protein. The introduced nucleic acid may also be cloned in different reading frames to achieve this read-through.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, the peptidyl inhibitor-p3 or peptidyl inhibitor-p7 or peptidyl inhibitor-p8 fusion peptide is also a fusion with an intervening haemagglutinin (HA) tag moiety e.g., upstream of the p3/p7/p8 sequence and downstream of the peptidyl inhibitor in the fusion peptide. The nucleic acid encoding the HA tag moiety is generally modified to remove the amber stop codon to thereby permit translational read-through from the 5′-end of sequence encoding the peptidyl inhibitor to the p3 or p7 or 8 moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, the fusion peptide comprises a cysteine residue positioned e.g., at the N-terminus of the peptidyl inhibitor moiety or at the C-terminus of the peptidyl inhibitor moiety or at the N-terminus of the p3 or p7 or p8 moiety or at the N-terminus of a HA-p3 or HA-p7 or HA-p8 moiety. In one example, the phagemid vector is engineered to provide a terminal cysteine residue or internal cysteine residue for the fusion peptide, preferably a single terminal cysteine residue or single internal cysteine residue e.g., introduced by mutation at the 5′-end of the coding sequence of p3 or p7 or p8. The presence of a single cysteine permits the expressed inhibitory peptide to form an intramolecular disulfide bridge between a sulfhydryl residue in the expressed inhibitory peptide, if present, and the N-terminal sulfhydryl residue of the p3 moiety or the p7 moiety or the p8 moiety or the HA-p3 moiety or the HA-p7 moiety or the HA-p8 moiety. Alternatively, the inclusion of a cysteine at the N-terminus or C-terminus of the peptidyl inhibitor permits the expressed inhibitory peptide to form an intramolecular disulfide bridge between the sulfhydryl residue of that cysteine and a sulfhydryl residue in the expressed inhibitory peptide, if present. It is not preferred for the phagemid vector to encode multiple cysteines in that portion of the p3 or p7 or p8 fusion peptide lacking the peptidyl inhibitor, and/or for a peptidyl inhibitor per se to comprise multiple cysteines when the phagemid vector encodes a cysteine residue in that portion of the p3 or p7 or p8 fusion peptide lacking the peptidyl inhibitor. Accordingly, in another example, the phagemid vector encodes a single cysteine in that portion of the p3 or p7 or p8 fusion peptide lacking the peptidyl inhibitor, and/or a peptidyl inhibitor comprises a single cysteine e.g., when the phagemid vector encodes a cysteine residue in that portion of the p3 or p7 or p8 fusion peptide lacking the peptidyl inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sequence encoding a fusion peptide according to any example hereof is displayed from an appropriate vector, e.g., a vector capable of replicating in bacterial cells. Suitable host cells e.g., \nE. coli\n, are then transformed with the recombinant vector. Said host cells are also infected with a helper phage particle encoding an unmodified form of the coat protein to which a nucleic acid fragment is operably linked. Transformed, infected host cells are cultured under conditions suitable for forming recombinant phagemid particles comprising more than one copy of the fusion protein on the surface of the particle. This system has been shown to be effective in the generation of virus particles such as, for example, a virus particle selected from the group comprising λ phage, T4 phage, M13 phage, T7 phage and baculovirus. Such phage display particles are then screened to identify a displayed protein having a conformation sufficient for binding to a target protein or nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeans for introducing the isolated nucleic acid molecule or a gene construct comprising same into a cell for expression are well-known to those skilled in the art. The technique used for a given organism depends on the known successful techniques. Means for introducing recombinant DNA into cells include microinjection, transfection mediated by DEAE-dextran, transfection mediated by liposomes such as by using lipofectamine (Gibco, MD, USA) and/or cellfectin (Gibco, MD, USA), PEG-mediated DNA uptake, electroporation and microparticle bombardment such as by using DNA-coated tungsten or gold particles (Agracetus Inc., WI, USA) amongst others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the peptide derivative comprises an N-terminal and/or C-terminal cysteine residue e.g., to facilitate intramolecular cross-linking or intermolecular cross-linking with another peptide such as the same or a different peptidyl inhibitor e.g., to form a multimeric peptide, or to facilitate intermolecular cross-linking with a different moiety e.g., phage p3 protein, phage p8 protein, PEG, serum protein-binding peptide. In another example, the peptide derivative comprises an N-terminal cysteine residue. In another example, the peptide derivative comprises a C-terminal cysteine residue. In another example, the peptide derivative does not comprise both an N-terminal and a C-terminal cysteine residue e.g., because the peptide autonomously forms a stable conformation thereby avoiding the need for cyclization mediated via disulfide bond/bridge formation between N-terminal and C-terminal cysteine residues. In another example, the peptide derivative is not capable of forming or does not form intramolecular disulfide bonds/bridges or cross-links e.g., because the peptide autonomously forms a stable conformation not requiring intramolecular disulfide constraint.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred CD40- and/or CD40L-signaling inhibitory peptides for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of one or more CD40L-mediated effects, especially one or more adverse consequences of aberrant CD40L-mediated signaling or CD40-mediated signaling are mimetic peptides that do not merely comprise a sequence corresponding to a fragment of a native protein that they inhibit to prevent it binding to its cognate partner or substrate e.g., they are not dominant negative mutants such as fragments of the native CD40-CD40L interface.\n\n\n \nProtein Transduction Domains\n\n\n \n \n \nTo facilitate entry into a cell, a peptidyl inhibitor described herein, including a base peptide or derivative or analog according to any example hereof, may be conjugated to a protein transduction domain, synthesized to include a protein transduction domain, or expressed recombinantly as a fusion protein comprising a protein transduction domain. As used herein, the term “protein transduction domain” shall be taken to mean a peptide or protein that is capable of enhancing, increasing or assisting penetration or uptake of a compound conjugated to the protein transduction domain into a cell either in vitro or in vivo. Those skilled in the art will be aware that synthetic or recombinant peptides can be delivered into cells through association with a protein transduction domain such as the TAT sequence from HIV or the Penetratin sequence derived from the Antennapaedia homeodomain protein (see, for example, Temsamani and Vidal, \nDrug Discovery Today \n9: 1012-1019, 2004, for review).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable protein transduction domain will be known to the skilled artisan and includes, for example, HIV-1 TAT fragment, signal sequence based \npeptide\n 1, signal sequence based \npeptide\n 2, transportan, amphiphilic model peptide, polyarginine, or a Kaposi fibroblast growth factor (FGF) hydrophobic peptide protein transduction domain. Additional suitable protein transduction domains are described, for example, in Zhao and Weisledder \nMedicinal Research Reviews, \n24: 1-12, 2004 and Wagstaff and Jans, \nCurrent Medicinal Chemistry, \n13: 1371-1387, 2006.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA protein transduction domain is covalently attached to the N-terminus or C-terminus of a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention, and may be a chiral analog e.g., a retroinverso peptidyl moiety or PEGylated moiety. For example, a peptidyl fusion comprising a protein transduction domain positioned N-terminal to a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention may be produced by standard peptide synthesis means or recombinant means without the exercise of undue experimentation based on the disclosure herein. Retroinverted peptide analogs comprising a protein transduction domain positioned N-terminal to a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention, wherein the complete sequence is retroinverted are particularly preferred and produced without inventive effort based on the disclosure herein. Peptidyl fusions comprising a protein transduction domain and a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention may comprise a spacer or linker moiety separating protein transduction domain and peptidyl inhibitor. Alternatively, the protein transduction domain and peptidyl inhibitor may be adjacent or juxtaposed in the peptidyl fusion.\n\n\n \nSerum Protein Moieties\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “serum protein moiety” shall be taken to refer to any serum protein, protein fragment or peptide having a long half life e.g., serum albumin, immunoglobulin, antibody fragment, transferrin, ferritin or other serum protein, having a long half life. By “long half life” is meant a half life in serum approximately the same as an albumin protein e.g., human serum albumin. In this respect, it is preferred for a serum protein moiety to confer on a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention administered to a subject, including any base peptide or derivative or analog thereof, a half-life that is at least about 25% or 50% or 75% or 90% or 95% or 99% the half-life of an endogenous serum albumin protein e.g., a murine animal or primate such as a human. For example, human serum albumin has a half life in humans of 19 days e.g., Peters et al., Adv. Protein Chem. 37, 161-245 (1985), and a half-life in mice of about 35 hours e.g., Chaudhury et al., J. Exp. Med. 197, 315-322 (2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred serum protein moiety is an immunoglobulin fragment. By “immunoglobulin fragment” is meant any derivative of an immunoglobulin wherein the undesired effector function of Fc has been disabled or deleted, and wherein the fragment has a long half life. For example, an immunoglobulin fragment may be an Fc-disabled antibody, immunoglobulin isotype not producing undesirable side-effects, or a modified Fc not producing undesirable Fc effector function. One preferred example of an Fc-disabled antibody is a CovXBody comprising a hapten linker and Fc-disabled antibody (CovX Research LLC, San Diego Calif. 92121, USA). The peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention may be linked to a CovXBody via the hapten linker moiety of the CovXBody according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA serum protein moiety is generally covalently attached to the N-terminus or C-terminus of a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention. For example, a peptidyl fusion comprising a serum protein moiety positioned N-terminal or C-terminal to a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention may be produced by standard peptide synthesis means or recombinant means without the exercise of undue experimentation based on the disclosure herein. Peptidyl fusions comprising a serum protein moiety and a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention may comprise a spacer or linker moiety separating serum protein moiety and peptidyl inhibitor. Alternatively, the serum protein moiety and peptidyl inhibitor may be adjacent or juxtaposed in the peptidyl fusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly preferred serum protein moieties for use in the present invention are retro-inverted peptides e.g., comprising a retroinverted analog of one or more serum protein moieties.\n\n\n \nSerum Protein-Binding Moieties\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “serum protein-binding moiety” shall be taken to refer to any peptide or protein having the ability to bind to a serum protein e.g., serum albumin or Fc region of an antibody or transferrin or ferritin or other serum protein having a long half life, to thereby enhance the half-life of a protein, especially a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention. By “long half life” is meant a half life in serum approximately the same as an albumin protein e.g., human serum albumin. In this respect, it is preferred for a serum protein-binding moiety to confer on a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention administered to a subject, including any base peptide or derivative or analog thereof, a half-life that is at least about 25% or 50% or 75% or 90% or 95% or 99% the half-life of an endogenous serum albumin protein e.g., a murine animal or primate such as a human. For example, human serum albumin has a half life in humans of 19 days e.g., Peters et al., Adv. Protein Chem. 37, 161-245 (1985), and a half-life in mice of about 35 hours e.g., Chaudhury et al., J. Exp. Med. 197, 315-322 (2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides and proteins that comprise an amino acid sequence capable of binding to serum albumin and increase the half-life of therapeutically relevant proteins and polypeptides are known in the art. Bacterial and synthetic serum protein-binding peptides are described e.g., in International Patent Publication Nos. WO1991/01743, WO2001/45746 and WO2002/076489. International Patent Publication No. WO2004/041865 describes “nanobodies” directed against serum albumin that can be linked to a protein to increase its half-life. Chaudhury et al., The J. Exp. Med. 3, 315-322 (2003) describe the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) or “Brambell receptor” as an pH-dependent serum protein-binding moiety. US Pat. Publication 20070269422 (Ablynx N.V.) discloses nanobodies or domain antibodies (dAbs) of about 115 amino acids in length and comprising framework regions i.e., FR1 to FR4 and complementarity-determining regions i.e., CDR1 to CDR3, and which have serum half-life of at least about 50% the natural half-life of serum albumin in a primate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred serum protein-binding moieties comprise peptides that consist of or comprise an albumin-binding domain (ABD) or albumin-binding domain antibody (dAb) e.g., as described by Nguyen et al., Protein Eng, Design Sel. 19, 291-297 (2006); Holt et al., Protein Eng, Design Sel. 21, 283-288 (2008); Johnsson et al., Protein Eng, Design Sel. 21, 515-527 (2008), and US Pat. Publication No. 20070202045 (Genentech, Inc.), each of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly preferred peptidyl serum protein-binding moieties for use in the present invention are retro-inverted peptides e.g., comprising a retroinverted analog of one or more serum protein-binding peptidyl moieties described in US Pat. Publication No. 20070202045 or US Pat. Publication 20070269422.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-peptidyl serum protein-binding moieties include e.g., clofibrate, clofibric acid, Tolmetin, Fenoprofen, Diflunisal, Etodolac, Naproxen, Nambutone, Ibuprofen, Chlorothiazide, Gemfibrozil, Nalidixic Acid, Methyldopate, Ampicillin, Cefamandole Nafate, N-(2-Nitrophenyl)-anthranilic Acid, N-Phenylanthranilic Acid and Quinidine Gluconate. The peptidyl inhibitors of the present invention may also be myristoylated, and/or modified by addition of a 4,4-diphenylcyclohexyl moiety e.g., Kurtzhals et al., Biochem. J. 312 (1995); Zobel et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 13, 1513 (2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly preferred non-peptidyl serum protein-binding moieties for use in the present invention include 4-phenylbutanoic acid moieties having hydrophobic substituents on the phenyl ring and conjugated to an amino acid such as a D-amino acid e.g., 4-(p-iodophenyl)butyric acid conjugated to D-lysine through the ε-amino group e.g., Dumelin et al., Agnew. Chem. Int. Ed. 47, 3196-3201 (2008) incorporated herein by reference, and any one of a series of similar conjugates comprising 4-phenylbutanoic acid moieties. Free 4-(p-iodophenyl)butyric acid, or 4-(p-iodophenyl)butyric acid conjugated to D-lysine, is readily conjugated to a peptidyl inhibitor of the invention by condensation between hydrogen of an α-amino or ε-amino group on the peptidyl inhibitor and the hydroxyl group of the 4-(p-iodophenyl)butyric acid moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA serum protein-binding moiety is generally covalently attached to the N-terminus or C-terminus of a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention, and may be a chiral analog e.g., a retroinverso peptidyl moiety or PEGylated moiety. For example, a peptidyl fusion comprising a serum protein-binding moiety positioned N-terminal or C-terminal to a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention may be produced by standard peptide synthesis means or recombinant means without the exercise of undue experimentation based on the disclosure herein. Retroinverted peptide analogs comprising a serum protein-binding moiety positioned N-terminal or C-terminal to a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention, wherein the complete sequence is retroinverted are particularly preferred and produced without inventive effort based on the disclosure herein. Other peptidomimetic strategies include e.g., peptoids, N-methylated peptides etc., which are also encompassed by the present invention. Peptidyl fusions comprising a serum protein-binding moiety and a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention may comprise a spacer or linker moiety separating serum protein-binding moiety and peptidyl inhibitor. Alternatively, the serum protein-binding moiety and peptidyl inhibitor may be adjacent or juxtaposed in the peptidyl fusion. Such configurations are readily modified by the inclusion of a protein transduction domain as described herein.\n\n\n \nSpacers and Linkers\n\n\n \n \n \nEach of the components of a peptidyl inhibitor described herein, including a base peptide or derivative or analog and any protein transduction domain, PEG moiety, serum protein-binding moiety according to any example hereof, may optionally be separated by a spacer or linker moiety. The spacer or linker moiety facilitates the independent folding of each of peptidyl inhibitor component, and/or provides for an appropriate steric spacing between plural peptide components and between peptidyl and non-peptidyl components. A suitable linker will be apparent to the skilled artisan. For example, it is often unfavorable to have a linker sequence with high propensity to adopt α-helix or β-strand structures, which could limit the flexibility of the protein and consequently its functional activity. Rather, a more desirable linker is a sequence with a preference to adopt extended conformation. In practice, most currently designed linker sequences have a high content of glycine residues that force the linker to adopt loop conformation. Glycine is generally used in designed linkers because the absence of a β-carbon permits the polypeptide backbone to access dihedral angles that are energetically forbidden for other amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the linker is hydrophilic, i.e. the residues in the linker are hydrophilic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, a linker is a glycine residue or polyglycine moiety or polyserin moiety. Linkers comprising glycine and/or serine have a high freedom degree for linking of two proteins, i.e., they enable the fused proteins to fold and produce functional proteins. Robinson and Sauer \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n95: 5929-5934, 1998 found that it is the composition of a linker peptide that is important for stability and folding of a fusion protein rather than a specific sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, linkers join identical peptide target binding moieties to form homodimers. In another example, linkers join different peptide target binding moieties to form heterodimers. In another example, the linker separates a peptidyl inhibitor of the invention from a protein transduction domain. In another example, the linker separates a peptidyl inhibitor of the invention from a PEG moiety. In another example, the linker separates a peptidyl inhibitor of the invention from a HES moiety. In another example, the linker separates a peptidyl inhibitor of the invention from a polyglycine moiety. In another example, the linker separates a peptidyl inhibitor of the invention from a serum protein moiety. In another example, the linker separates a peptidyl inhibitor of the invention from a serum protein-binding moiety. In another example, the linker separates a protein transduction domain from a PEG moiety, HED moiety, polyglycine moiety, serum protein moiety or serum protein-binding moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptidyl linkers may also be derivatized or analogs prepared there from according to standard procedures described herein.\n\n\n \nBase Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one example, a base peptide comprises an amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 18 or 44.\n\n\n \nPeptide Derivatives\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also encompasses a derivative of a peptide inhibitor of CD40 and/or CD40L signaling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “derivative” shall be taken to mean a peptide that is derived from an inhibitory peptide of the invention as described herein e.g., a fragment or processed form of the peptide, wherein the active portion of the base peptide is not modified e.g., a functional fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “functional fragment” shall be taken to mean a fragment of a peptide or analog thereof that is capable of binding to CD40L and/or reducing or preventing CD40L binding to CD40 and/or reducing or preventing CD40-mediated signaling and/or CD40L-mediated signaling. In this respect, the activity of a functional fragment need not equivalent to the based peptide (or an analog) from which it is derived. For example, the fragment may have slightly enhanced or reduced activity compared to the peptide or analog from which it is derived by virtue of the removal of flanking sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “derivative” also encompasses fusion proteins comprising a peptide of the invention. For example, the fusion protein comprises a label, such as, for example, an epitope, e.g., a FLAG epitope or a V5 epitope or an HA epitope. For example, the epitope is a FLAG epitope. Such a tag is useful for, for example, purifying the fusion protein. Alternatively, or in addition, a derivative in this context may comprise a peptidyl protein transduction domain and/or serum protein-binding peptide or domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “derivative” also encompasses a derivatized peptide, such as, for example, a peptide modified to contain one or more-chemical moieties other than an amino acid. The chemical moiety may be linked covalently to the peptide e.g., via an amino terminal amino acid residue, a carboxyl terminal amino acid residue, or at an internal amino acid residue. Such modifications include the addition of a protective or capping group on a reactive moiety in the peptide, addition of a detectable label, and other changes that do not adversely destroy the activity of the peptide compound. For example, a derivative may comprise a PEG moiety, radionuclide, colored latex, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA derivative generally possesses or exhibits an improved characteristic relative to a e.g., enhanced protease resistance and/or longer half-life and/or enhanced transportability between cells or tissues of the human or animal body and/or reduced adverse effect(s) and/or enhanced affinity for CD40L and/or enhanced CD40L-signaling inhibitory activity and/or enhanced CD40-signaling inhibitory activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples of peptide derivatives may be employed separately or in combination using standard procedures known to the skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, a peptide derivative comprises a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety e.g., having a molecular mass of about 5 kDa or about 12 kDa or about 20 kDa or about 30 kDa or about 40 kDa. The PEG moiety may comprise a branched or unbranched molecule. A PEG moiety may be added to the N-terminus and/or to the C-terminus of a peptidyl inhibitor of the invention, including a peptide, derivative or analog thereof as described according to any example herein. A PEG moiety may enhance serum half-life of the peptidyl inhibitor e.g., by protecting the peptide from degradation. A PEG moiety may be separated from the N-terminus and/or C-terminus of the peptidyl inhibitor by a spacer e.g., comprising up to 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 carbon atoms such as an 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl spacer. For example, a spacer may reduce steric hindrance of the inhibition of CD40 or CD40L signaling or reduce steric hindrance of inhibition of the CD40-CD40L interaction. Maleimide chemistry may be employed to conjugate a PEG moiety to the peptide e.g., via cysteine residues located either within or at the N-terminal end of the peptide. For peptides that are refractory to conjugation in this manner e.g., by virtue of intramolecular disulfide bridge formation, a variety of other chemistries known to the skilled artisan may be employed to ligate PEG moieties onto the N-terminal and/or C-terminal ends of the peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, a peptide derivative comprises a hydroxyethyl starch (HES) moiety i.e., the peptidyl inhibitor is “HESylated”. The HES moiety may comprise a branched or unbranched molecule. A HES moiety may be added to the N-terminus and/or to the C-terminus of a peptidyl inhibitor of the invention, including a peptide, derivative or analog thereof as described according to any example herein. A HES moiety may enhance serum half-life of the peptidyl inhibitor e.g., by protecting the peptide from degradation. A HES moiety may be separated from the N-terminus and/or C-terminus of the peptidyl inhibitor by a spacer e.g., comprising up to 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 carbon atoms such as an 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl spacer. For example, a spacer may reduce steric hindrance of the inhibition of CD40 or CD40L signaling or reduce steric hindrance of inhibition of the CD40-CD40L interaction. Maleimide chemistry may be employed to conjugate a HES moiety to the peptide e.g., via cysteine residues located either within or at the N-terminal end of the peptide. For peptides that are refractory to conjugation in this manner e.g., by virtue of intramolecular disulfide bridge formation, a variety of other chemistries known to the skilled artisan may be employed to ligate HES moieties onto the N-terminal and/or C-terminal ends of the peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, a peptide derivative comprises a polyglycine moiety e.g., comprising two or three or four or five or six or seven or eight or nine or ten glycine residues covalently linked. A polyglycine moiety may be added to the N-terminus and/or to the C-terminus of a peptidyl inhibitor of the invention, including a peptide, derivative or analog thereof as described according to any example herein, to produce a “polyglycinated” peptide. A polyglycine moiety may enhance serum half-life of the peptidyl inhibitor e.g., by protecting the peptide from degradation. A polyglycine moiety may be further separated from the N-terminus and/or C-terminus of the peptidyl inhibitor by a spacer e.g., comprising up to 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 carbon atoms such as an 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl spacer. Standard recombinant means, oxime chemistry or peptide synthetic means are employed to add a polyglycine moiety to a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention. A polyglycine moiety may also be used in conjunction with another moiety to extend the half-life of a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention as described according to any example hereof, wherein the polyglycine moiety itself may serve further as a spacer between the peptidyl inhibitor and the other moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, a peptide derivative comprises a serum protein moiety or serum protein-binding moiety as described according to any example hereof, which may be added to the N-terminus and/or to the C-terminus of a peptidyl inhibitor of the invention, including a peptide, derivative or analog thereof as described according to any example herein. A serum protein moiety or serum protein-binding moiety may enhance serum half-life of the peptidyl inhibitor or translocation of the peptide in serum. A serum protein moiety or serum protein-binding moiety may be separated from the N-terminus and/or C-terminus of the peptidyl inhibitor by a spacer e.g., comprising up to 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 carbon atoms such as an 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl spacer. For example, a spacer may reduce steric hindrance of the inhibition of CD40 or CD40L signaling or reduce steric hindrance of inhibition of the CD40-CD40L interaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, a peptide derivative comprises a moiety e.g., a peptide, capable of inhibiting binding to Fc and/or otherwise reducing adverse consequences of activating CD40. Such a moiety may be added to the N-terminus and/or to the C-terminus of a peptidyl inhibitor of the invention, including a peptide, derivative or analog thereof as described according to any example herein. Such a moiety may be separated from the N-terminus and/or C-terminus of the peptidyl inhibitor by a spacer e.g., comprising up to 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 carbon atoms such as an 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl spacer. For example, a spacer may reduce steric hindrance of the inhibition of CD40 or CD40L signaling or reduce steric hindrance of inhibition of the CD40-CD40L interaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the peptide derivative comprises an N-terminal and/or C-terminal cysteine residue e.g., to facilitate intramolecular cross-linking or intermolecular cross-linking with another peptide such as the same or a different peptidyl inhibitor e.g., to form a multimeric peptide, or to facilitate intermolecular cross-linking with a different moiety e.g., phage p3 protein, phage p8 protein, serum protein moiety or serum protein-binding moiety. In another example, the peptide derivative comprises an N-terminal cysteine residue. In another example, the peptide derivative comprises a C-terminal cysteine residue. In another example, the peptide derivative does not comprise both an N-terminal and a C-terminal cysteine residue e.g., because the peptide autonomously forms a stable conformation thereby avoiding the need for cyclization mediated via disulfide bond/bridge formation between N-terminal and C-terminal cysteine residues. In another example, the peptide derivative is not capable of forming or does not form intramolecular disulfide bonds/bridges or cross-links e.g., because the peptide autonomously forms a stable conformation not requiring intramolecular disulfide constraint.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the peptide derivative comprises a plurality of peptides of the present invention. Such “chain-extended” variants may bind to CD40L with higher affinity than the monomeric base peptide e.g., by virtue of the larger ligand binding to CD40L over a larger surface area but within the same proximity as the monomeric base peptide. Such chain extended variants may also exhibit increased affinity for CD40L over their monomeric constituent sequences by virtue of increasing local inhibitor concentration and/or by concurrent binding to adjacent CD40L subunits or adjacent sites on the same subunit, thereby benefiting from an avidity effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for producing multimeric proteins include conventional peptide synthesis and recombinant expression means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferred example, the ligand-binding interface with CD40L is extended by directed evolution to achieve multimerization. In this example, a second peptidyl inhibitor is positioned downstream of a first peptidyl inhibitor, wherein said positioning is adjacent or spaced apart e.g., by one or more amino acids or other linker/spacer molecule as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, multimeric proteins are produced by expression in a single phagemid vector having one or more recombination sites for a site-specific recombinase e.g., one or more attachment sites selected from the group consisting of lox, RS, gix, frt, attB, attP, attL and attR. The phagemid vector may be a modified form of any phagemid vector suitable for phage display methodology, the only requirement being the addition of one or more attachment sites for a site-specific recombinase. For example, the filamentous phage may be a single stranded DNA bacteriophage vector, a modified phagemid pIII (syn. P3) or PVIII (syn. P8) display vector comprising one or more attachment sites for a site-specific recombinase, a modified phagemid gIII display vector comprising one or more attachment sites for a site-specific recombinase, a modified pJUFO vector comprising one or more attachment sites for a site-specific recombinase, or a modified pLUCK vector comprising one or more attachment sites for a site-specific recombinase. A preferred form of a suitable phagemid vector for expressing multimeric peptide comprises:\n\n\n \n \n(i) one or more recombination sites for a site-specific recombinase positioned so as to provide for recombination between said vector and a nucleic acid molecule encoding one or more amino acid sequences to be expressed from said vector wherein said recombination provides for expression of a fusion protein between said one or more amino acid sequences and a filamentous phage protein e.g., p3 or p8;\n\n\n(ii) a promoter e.g., a lambda PL promoter, positioned so as to be capable of regulating transcription of nucleic acid encoding the fusion protein at (i);\n\n\n(iii) at least one sequence capable of terminating transcription of nucleic acid encoding the fusion protein at (i);\n\n\n(iv) a replication origin derived from a filamentous phage;\n\n\n(v) a plasmid replication origin; and\n\n\n(vi) at least one selection marker.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the phagemid vector comprises two recombination sites for a site-specific recombinase wherein each of said recombination sites is positioned so as to provide for recombination between said vector and a nucleic acid molecule encoding one or more amino acid sequences to be expressed from said vector wherein said recombination provides for expression of a fusion protein between said one or more amino acid sequences and a filamentous phage protein e.g., p3 or p8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsolated nucleic acid encoding one or more amino acid sequences for multimerization are sub-clones into the phagemid vector, wherein said nucleic acid comprises one or more recombination sites for a site-specific recombinase compatible with one or more recombination sites for the same site-specific recombinase on the phagemid vector. For example, the isolated nucleic acid may encode one or more amino acid sequences wherein each of said amino acid sequences is capable of forming secondary structures and/or super-secondary structures, e.g., a peptidyl inhibitor of the invention, or secondary structure as shown in Table 1 hereof, a fold, or an assembly of secondary structures. Exemplary nucleic acids encode peptide inhibitors of one or more protein-protein interaction(s) and/or one or more biological phenotypes attributable to said protein-protein interaction(s) e.g., nucleic acid encoding one or more CD40L peptide inhibitors of the present invention as described according to any example hereof. Wherein the isolated nucleic acid encodes a single amino acid sequence, the recombination site(s) will generally be positioned at one end or so as to flank the sequence encoding the amino acid sequence being introduced to the vector. Wherein the isolated nucleic acid encodes a plurality of amino acid sequences to be expressed by phage display, the recombination sites will generally be positioned at one end or so as to flank each nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid sequence being introduced to the vector, or alternatively, flanking the nucleic acid encoding all of the amino acid sequences being introduced to the vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe isolated nucleic acid introduced to the vector may comprise a spacer nucleotide sequence, e.g., encoding an amino acid spacer such as a GS linker, to provide for spatial separation between amino acid sequences of interest in the expressed multimeric protein and/or to provide for spatial separation between the nucleotide sequence encoding amino acid sequences of interest and recombination sites e.g., to prevent spurious recombination of functionally-important coding sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further example, a plurality of peptides is expressed in a single phagemid vector, by a method comprising:\n\n\n \n \n(i) providing a phagemid vector having one or more recombination sites for a site-specific recombinase said sites being positioned so as to provide for recombination between said vector and a nucleic acid molecule encoding one or more amino acid sequences to be expressed from said vector;\n\n\n(ii) providing isolated nucleic acid encoding one or more amino acid sequences and wherein said nucleic acid comprises one or more recombination sites for a site-specific recombinase compatible with one or more recombination sites for the same site-specific recombinase on the phagemid vector to which said nucleic acid is to be introduced;\n\n\n(iii) causing recombination to occur between said one or more recombination sites for a site-specific recombinase at (i) and said one or more recombination sites for a site-specific recombinase at (ii) to thereby produce a phagemid vector capable of expressing of a fusion protein between said one or more amino acid sequences at (ii) and a filamentous phage protein e.g., p3 or p8;\n\n\n(iv) providing the phagemid vector produced at (iii) and isolated nucleic acid encoding one or more amino acid sequences, wherein said isolated nucleic acid comprises one or more recombination sites for a site-specific recombinase compatible with one or more recombination sites for the same site-specific recombinase on the phagemid vector produced at (iii); and\n\n\n(v) causing recombination to occur between recombination sites for a site-specific recombinase at (iv) to thereby produce a phagemid vector capable of expressing of a fusion protein between a plurality of amino acid sequences and a filamentous phage protein e.g., p3 or p8.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn integrase e.g., a tyrosine integrase, or serine recombinase may be employed to facilitate recombination events, the only requirements being compatibility of the site-specific recombination sites between the phagemid vector and nucleic acid to be introduced, and the enzyme(s) or enzyme complex(es) used to promote excision and ligation events. Such compatible recombinase systems are known to those skilled in the art when provided with suitable site-specific recombination systems, or described herein, including Sin resolvase, ΦRv1 integrase, lambda integrase, Cre recombinase, R recombinase, Gin recombinase and FLP recombinase, amongst others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo or three or four or five or six or more peptides may be recombined into the same fusion protein for expression with a filamentous phage protein. A limitation to the number of monomers that are introduced into the phage vector may be provided by stability considerations from highly repetitive sequences in the case of homomeric proteins, and the number of units provided in the isolated nucleic acid being introduced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of the present invention provides an isolated phagemid vector having one or more recombination sites for a site-specific recombinase said sites being positioned so as to provide for recombination between said vector and a nucleic acid molecule encoding one or more amino acid sequences to be expressed from said vector. In one example, the isolated phagemid vector comprises one or more recombination sites for a site-specific recombinase positioned so as to provide for recombination between said vector and a nucleic acid molecule encoding one or more amino acid sequences to be expressed from said vector wherein said recombination provides for expression of a fusion protein between said one or more amino acid sequences and a filamentous phage protein e.g., p3 or p8. In another example, the isolated phagemid vector comprises:\n\n\n \n \n(i) one or more recombination sites for a site-specific recombinase positioned so as to provide for recombination between said vector and a nucleic acid molecule encoding one or more amino acid sequences to be expressed from said vector wherein said recombination provides for expression of a fusion protein between said one or more amino acid sequences and a filamentous phage protein e.g., p3 or p8;\n\n\n(ii) a promoter e.g., a lambda PL promoter, positioned so as to be capable of regulating transcription of nucleic acid encoding the fusion protein at (i);\n\n\n(iii) at least one sequence capable of terminating transcription of nucleic acid encoding the fusion protein at (i);\n\n\n(iv) a replication origin derived from a filamentous phage;\n\n\n(v) a plasmid replication origin; and\n\n\n(vi) at least one selection marker.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phagemid vector may comprise one or more recombination sites for a site-specific recombinase wherein a recombination site is selected from the group consisting of lox, RS, gix, frt, attB, attP, attL and attR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the phagemid vector is a single stranded DNA bacteriophage vector. In another example, the phagemid vector is a modified phagemid p3 or p8 display vector comprising one or more attachment sites for a site-specific recombinase. In a further example, the phagemid vector is a modified phagemid gIII display vector comprising one or more attachment sites for a site-specific recombinase. In a further example, the phagemid vector is a modified pJUFO vector comprising one or more attachment sites for a site-specific recombinase. In another example, the phagemid vector is a modified pLUCK vector comprising one or more attachment sites for a site-specific recombinase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further example, the present invention provides for the use of a phagemid vector of the present invention in the expression of a synthetic multimeric protein by phage display. In one example, a combinatorial protein will comprise a plurality of peptide monomers each monomer having the same binding affinity and/or substrate specificity and/or or functionality. The peptide monomers may be closely-related by sequence or divergent e.g., variants of the same base peptide sequence or derived from different peptides. In another example, a combinatorial protein will comprise a plurality of peptide monomers each monomer having a different binding affinity and/or substrate specificity and/or or functionality e.g., wherein the peptide monomers are divergent at the sequence level and/or derived from different peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be apparent to the skilled artisan that means for derivation of a peptide apply equally to any peptidyl inhibitor of the invention, an analog thereof, and any additional peptidyl components of a fusion peptide e.g., a protein transduction domain and/or peptidyl linker or spacer and/or serum protein moiety and/or serum protein-binding moiety to which the peptidyl inhibitor(s) and/or analog(s) is/are attached.\n\n\n \nPeptide Analogs\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another example of the invention, a CD40 and/or CD40L signaling inhibitor is a peptide analog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “analog” shall be taken to mean a peptide wherein the active portion is modified e.g., to comprise one or more naturally-occurring and/or non-naturally-occurring amino acids, provided that the peptide analog is capable of inhibiting or reducing CD40 and/or CD40L signaling. For example, the term “analog” encompasses an inhibitory peptide comprising one or more conservative amino acid changes. In another example, an “analog” comprises one or more D-amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn analog generally possesses or exhibits an improved characteristic relative to a base peptide from which it is derived e.g., enhanced protease resistance and/or longer half-life and/or enhanced transportability between cells or tissues of the human or animal body and/or reduced adverse effect(s) and/or enhanced affinity for CD40L and/or enhanced CD40L-signaling inhibitory activity and/or enhanced CD40-signaling inhibitory activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable peptide analogs include, for example, a peptide comprising one or more conservative amino acid substitutions. A “conservative amino acid substitution” is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art, including basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), β-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt also is contemplated that other sterically similar compounds may be formulated to mimic the key portions of the peptide structure. Such compounds, which may be termed peptidomimetics, may be used in the same manner as a CD40 and/or CD40L signaling peptide inhibitor or derivative thereof. The generation of such an analog may be achieved by the techniques of modeling and chemical design known to those of skill in the art. It will be understood that all such sterically similar peptide analogs fall within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn example of an analog of a peptide of the invention comprises one or more non-naturally occurring amino acids or amino acid analogs. For example, a peptide inhibitor as described herein comprises one or more naturally occurring non-genetically encoded L-amino acids, synthetic L-amino acids or D-enantiomers of an amino acid. For example, the peptide comprises only D-amino acids. For example, the analog comprises one or more residues selected from the group consisting of: hydroxyproline, β-alanine, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, α-aminoisobutyric acid, N-methylglycine (sarcosine), ornithine, citrulline, t-butylalanine, t-butylglycine, N-methylisoleucine, phenylglycine, cyclohexylalanine, norleucine, naphthylalanine, pyridylananine 3-benzothienyl alanine 4-chlorophenylalanine, 2-fluorophenylalanine, 3-fluorophenylalanine, 4-fluorophenylalanine, penicillamine, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-tic isoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid β-2-thienylalanine, methionine sulfoxide, homoarginine, N-acetyl lysine, 2,4-diamino butyric acid, ρ-aminophenylalanine, N-methylvaline, homocysteine, homoserine, ε-amino hexanoic acid, δ-amino valeric acid, 2,3-diaminobutyric acid and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther amino acid residues that are useful for making the peptides and peptide analogs described herein can be found, e.g., in Fasman, 1989, CRC Practical Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, CRC Press, Inc., and the references cited therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention additionally encompasses an isostere of a peptide described herein. The term “isostere” as used herein is intended to include a chemical structure that can be substituted for a second chemical structure because the steric conformation of the first structure fits a binding site specific for the second structure. The term specifically includes peptide back-bone modifications (i.e., amide bond mimetics) known to those skilled in the art. Such modifications include modifications of the amide nitrogen, the α-carbon, amide carbonyl, complete replacement of the amide bond, extensions, deletions or backbone crosslinks. Several peptide backbone modifications are known, including ψ[CH\n2\nS], ψ[CH\n2\nNH], ψ[CSNH\n2\n], ψ[NHCO], ψ[COCH\n2\n], and ψ[(E) or (Z) CH═CH]. In the nomenclature used above, ψ indicates the absence of an amide bond. The structure that replaces the amide group is specified within the brackets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther modifications include, for example, an N-alkyl (or aryl) substitution (ψ [CONR]), or backbone crosslinking to construct lactams and other cyclic structures. Other derivatives of the modulator compounds of the invention include C-terminal hydroxymethyl derivatives, O-modified derivatives (e.g., C-terminal hydroxymethyl benzyl ether), N-terminally modified derivatives including substituted amides such as alkylamides and hydrazides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, a peptide analog is a retro-peptide analog (see, for example, Goodman et al., \nAccounts of Chemical Research, \n12:1-7, 1979). A retro-peptide analog comprises a reversed amino acid sequence of a peptide inhibitor described herein. For example, a retro-peptide analog of a peptide inhibitor comprises a reversed amino acid sequence of a sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 35 to 43 or a reversed sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 34 or 44. Optionally, the peptide analog comprises an additional feature, such as, for example, a protein transduction domain and/or serum protein moiety and/or serum protein-binding moiety, each of which may also be a retro-peptide analog. The retro-peptide analog according to any example hereof may be PEGylated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further example, an analog of a peptide described herein is a retro-inverso peptide (as described, for example, in Sela and Zisman, \nFASEB J. \n11:449, 1997). Evolution has ensured the almost exclusive occurrence of L-amino acids in naturally occurring proteins. As a consequence, virtually all proteases cleave peptide bonds between adjacent L-amino acids. Accordingly, artificial proteins or peptides composed of D-amino acids are preferably resistant to proteolytic breakdown. Retro-inverso peptide analogs are isomers of linear peptides in which the direction of the amino acid sequence is reversed (retro) and the chirality, D- or L-, of one or more amino acids therein is inverted (inverso) e.g., using D-amino acids rather than L-amino acids, e.g., Jameson et al., \nNature, \n368, 744-746 (1994); Brady et al., \nNature, \n368, 692-693 (1994). The net result of combining D-enantiomers and reverse synthesis is that the positions of carbonyl and amino groups in each amide bond are exchanged, while the position of the side-chain groups at each alpha carbon is preserved. An advantage of retro-inverso peptides is their enhanced activity in vivo due to improved resistance to proteolytic degradation, i.e., the peptide has enhanced stability. (e.g., Chorev et al., \nTrends Biotech. \n13, 438-445, 1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRetro-inverso peptide analogs may be complete or partial. Complete retro-inverso peptides are those in which a complete sequence of a peptide descried herein is reversed and the chirality of each amino acid in a sequence is inverted, other than glycine, because glycine does not have a chiral analog. Partial retro-inverso peptide analogs are those in which only some of the peptide bonds are reversed and the chirality of only those amino acid residues in the reversed portion is inverted. For example, one or two or three or four or five or six or seven or eight or nine or ten or eleven or twelve or thirteen or fourteen or fifteen or sixteen or seventeen or eighteen or nineteen or twenty or twenty one or twenty two or twenty three or twenty four or twenty five or twenty six or twenty seven or twenty eight or twenty nine or thirty or thirty one or thirty two or thirty three or thirty four or thirty five or thirty six or thirty seven or thirty eight amino acid residues are D-amino acids. The present invention clearly encompasses both partial and complete retro-inverso peptide analogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this respect, such a retroinverso peptide analog may optionally include an additional component, such as, for example, a protein transduction domain, which may also be retroinverted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a retro-inverso peptide analog comprises an amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 35 to 43, or a retro-inverso peptide analog of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 34 or 44. Optionally, a retro-inverso peptide analog comprises an additional feature, such as, for example, a protein transduction domain and/or serum protein moiety and/or serum protein-binding moiety, each of which may also be a retro-peptide analog. The retro-inverso peptide analog according to any example hereof may also be PEGylated, HESylated or polyglycinated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another example, a base peptide is mutated to thereby improve the bioactivity of the peptide, e.g., the affinity with which the peptide binds to a target molecule and/or the specificity with which a peptide binds to a target molecule. Methods for mutating a peptide will be apparent to the skilled artisan and/or are described herein an include e.g., affinity maturation. For example, diverse amino acid sequences may be derived from a base peptide and peptides produced, by synthetic or recombinant means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor affinity maturation employing synthetic means, the amino acid sequences of a peptide inhibitor is modified in silico e.g., so as to retain secondary structure characteristics of the base peptide, a data set of related sequences is produced, and the peptides are synthesized and screened for activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor affinity maturation employing recombinant means, it is necessary to mutate nucleic acids encoding a diverse set of amino acid sequences by site-directed or random mutagenesis approaches. For example, nucleic acid may be amplified using mutagenic PCR such as by (i) performing the PCR reaction in the presence of manganese; and/or (ii) performing the PCR in the presence of a concentration of dNTPs sufficient to result in misincorporation of nucleotides. Methods of inducing random mutations using PCR are known in the art and are described, for example, in Dieffenbach (ed) and Dveksler (ed) (In: PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratories, NY, 1995). Furthermore, commercially available kits for use in mutagenic PCR are obtainable, such as, for example, the Diversify PCR Random Mutagenesis Kit (Clontech) or the GeneMorph Random Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). For example, a PCR reaction is performed in the presence of at least about 200 μM manganese or a salt thereof, more preferably at least about 300 μM manganese or a salt thereof, or even more preferably at least about 500 μM or at least about 600 μM manganese or a salt thereof. Such concentrations manganese ion or a manganese salt induce from about 2 mutations per 1000 base pairs (bp) to about 10 mutations every 1000 bp of amplified nucleic acid (Leung \net al \nTechnique\n \n \n \n1, 11-15, 1989).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, nucleic acid is mutated by inserting said nucleic acid into a host cell that is capable of mutating nucleic acid. Such host cells are deficient in one or more enzymes, such as, for example, one or more recombination or DNA repair enzymes, thereby enhancing the rate of mutation to a rate that is rate approximately 5,000 to 10,000 times higher than for non-mutant cells. Strains particularly useful for the mutation of nucleic acids carry alleles that modify or inactivate components of the mismatch repair pathway. Examples of such alleles include alleles selected from the group consisting of mutY, mutM, mutD, mutT, mutA, mutC and mutS. Bacterial cells that carry alleles that modify or inactivate components of the mismatch repair pathway are known in the art, such as, for example the XL-1Red, XL-mutS and XL-mutS-Kan\nr \nbacterial cells (Stratagene).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will also be apparent to the skilled artisan that unitary analogs may be produced from any peptidyl inhibitor of the invention, with or without any other peptidyl moieties covalently attached to the inhibitor e.g., as an analog of a fusion peptide comprising e.g., one or more peptidyl inhibitors and an element selected from a protein transduction domain and/or peptidyl linker or spacer and/or serum protein moiety and/or serum protein-binding peptide moiety to which the peptidyl inhibitor(s) is/are attached. Such unitary analogs may be derivatized as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n2. Non-Peptidyl Inhibitors of CD40 and/or CD40L Signaling\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA non-peptidyl inhibitor described herein may be a nucleic acid or small molecule or a derivative or analog thereof according to any example hereof, that functions as a CD40 signaling inhibitor and/or a CD40L signaling inhibitor. Preferred non-peptidyl inhibitors of the present invention are functional equivalents of a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention, however they preferably possess enhanced inhibitory activity or affinity for CD40L, or enhanced pharmaceutical properties e.g., longer half-life, enhanced uptake and/or transportability between cells or tissues of the animal body and/or suitability for a particular mode of administration e.g., injectability, inhalability or modified solubility characteristic. Antibody inhibitors are less preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs with peptidyl inhibitors, a non-peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention will reduce or prevent CD40L-binding activity and/or CD40L-signaling inhibitory activity and/or CD40-signaling inhibitory activity e.g., by virtue or preventing an interaction between CD40L and CD40 that activates the CD40:CD40L costimulatory pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “derivative” or “analog” in the context of a non-peptidyl inhibitor refers broadly to a non-peptidyl composition in a modified form compared to the inhibitory molecule from which it is derived and retains inhibitory activity or possesses enhanced inhibitory activity with respect to CD40L-binding and/or CD40L-signaling and/or CD40-signaling e.g., by virtue or preventing an interaction between CD40L and CD40 that activates the CD40:CD40L costimulatory pathway. A derivative or analog need not possess equivalent inhibitory activity compared to the molecule (or peptide) from which it is derived.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example of the invention, a non-peptidyl inhibitor of CD40 and/or CD40L signaling comprises nucleic acid that reduces or prevents the interaction between CD40 and CD40L e.g., by binding to CD40L at or near the interaction interface or other site required for CD40 and/or CD40L signaling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, a CD40L-signaling inhibitor or CD40-signaling inhibitor is a small molecule. The present invention thus includes a small molecule inhibitor and/or uses thereof for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of one or more conditions associated with aberrant CD40L-signaling or aberrant CD40-signaling and complications thereof. For example, a small molecule inhibitor is used in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of one or more conditions associated with aberrant CD40L-signaling or aberrant CD40-signaling and/or complications thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable small molecule inhibitor is identified from a library of small molecules. Techniques for synthesizing small organic compounds will vary considerably depending upon the compound, however such methods will be well known to those skilled in the art. In one embodiment, informatics is used to select suitable chemical building blocks from known compounds, for producing a combinatorial library. For example, QSAR (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship) modeling approach uses linear regressions or regression trees of compound structures to determine suitability. The software of the Chemical Computing Group, Inc. (Montreal, Canada) uses high-throughput screening experimental data on active as well as inactive compounds, to create a probabilistic QSAR model, which is subsequently used to select lead compounds. The Binary QSAR method is based upon three characteristic properties of compounds that form a “descriptor” of the likelihood that a particular compound will or will not perform a required function: partial charge, molar refractivity (bonding interactions), and logP (lipophilicity of molecule). Each atom has a surface area in the molecule and it has these three properties associated with it. All atoms of a compound having a partial charge in a certain range are determined and the surface areas (Van der Walls Surface Area descriptor) are summed. The binary QSAR models are then used to make activity models or ADMET models, which are used to build a combinatorial library. Accordingly, lead compounds identified in initial screens, can be used to expand the list of compounds being screened to thereby identify highly active compounds.\n\n\n \nAssays to Identify and Isolate Therapeutic and Prophylactic Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nAny assay described herein for identifying binding activity to CD40L and/or an interaction between CD40L and CD40 and/or a functionality of CD40L signaling such as CD40L-induced expression of CD86 and/or CD40L-mediated T cell proliferation and/or CD40L-dependent and CD40-mediated signaling, may be employed to identify a peptidyl or non-peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention. Alternatively, or in addition, one or more accepted animal models of CD40L-dependent signaling (i.e., CD40-mediated event and/or CD40L-dependent CD40-mediated event) may be employed e.g., a murine model of acute airways inflammation, a primate model of allograft rejection, a murine model of diabetes, a murine model of atherosclerosis, a murine model of angiogenesis, a murine EAE model of multiple sclerosis, a rodent model of graft-versus-host-disease, a rodent model of mercuric chloride-induced glomerulonephritis, and a rodent model of inflammatory bowel disease, each of which is known to the skilled artisan. For example, screens for inhibition of CD40L are described herein which can distinguish between peptide inhibitors with distinct modes of action. In one example, competitive inhibitors of the interaction between CD40L and its cognate receptor CD40 are identified. In another example, allosteric inhibitors which alter the conformation of CD40L upon binding, thereby blocking its activity, are identified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a compound library or mixture may be screened e.g., to isolate a compound that antagonizes the interaction between CD40L and CD40 and/or antagonizes CD40L signaling or CD40 signaling or CD40L-induced expression of CD86 or inhibits CD40L-mediated T cell proliferation. This may require repeated screening of pools of compounds in vitro or in vivo to eventually purify the compound free or substantially free of contaminants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a previously-isolated compound not known to have the ability to antagonize the interaction between CD40L and CD40 and/or antagonize CD40L signaling or CD40 signaling or CD40L-induced expression of CD86 or to inhibit CD40L-mediated T cell proliferation, is screened by one or more of the foregoing assays to determine whether or not it has the required property.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that the foregoing assays can be utilized in separately or collectively and in any order determined empirically to identify or isolate the desired product at a level of purity and having a suitable activity ascribed to it e.g., for therapy. The activity and purity of the compounds determined by these assays make the compound suitable of formulations e.g., injectable and/or inhalable medicaments and/or oral formulations for treatment and/or prophylaxis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention encompasses the use of any in silico or in vitro analytical method and/or industrial process for carrying the screening methods described herein into a pilot scale production or industrial scale production of a compound identified in such screens. This invention also provides information for such production method(s). Accordingly, the present invention also provides a process for identifying or determining a compound supra, said method comprising:\n\n \n \n \n(i) performing a method as described herein according to any embodiment to thereby identify a compound;\n \n(ii) optionally, determining the amount of the compound;\n \n(iii) optionally, determining the structure of the compound; and\n \n(iv) providing the compound or the name or structure of the compound such as, for example, in a paper form, machine-readable form, or computer-readable form.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “providing the compound” shall be taken to include any chemical or recombinant synthetic means for producing said compound (with or without derivitization) or alternatively, the provision of a compound that has been previously synthesized by any person or means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the compound or the name or structure of the compound is provided with an indication as to its use e.g., as determined by a screen described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention additionally provides a process for identifying or determining a compound or modulator supra, said method comprising:\n\n \n \n \n(i) performing a method as described herein according to any embodiment to thereby identify or determine a compound;\n \n(ii) optionally, determining the amount of the compound;\n \n(iii) optionally, determining the structure of the compound;\n \n(iv) optionally, providing the name or structure of the compound such as, for example, in a paper form, machine-readable form, or computer-readable form; and\n \n(v) providing the compound.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn the case of a peptide, the method optionally further comprises providing a chemical derivative of the peptide by protection of the amino- or carboxyl-terminus, cyclization of the peptide or construction of the peptide as a retroinverso peptide. The method also optionally involves identifying and/or validating one or more peptidyl compounds such as by displaying a peptide in vitro or on a bacteriophage particle, e.g., using lytic T7-based or non-lytic M13-based phage display, identifying the sequence of the peptide, making the compound by recombinant means or peptide chemistry, and testing the ability of the peptide to produce a desired effect such as reduced or prevented neutrophilic inflammation or inhibition of a specific protein interaction involved in a neutrophilic inflammatory response. Preferably, the peptide is displayed within a protein-based scaffold e.g., a scaffold structure derived from lipocalin, ankyrin repeats, fibronectin, kunitz domains, A-domains, affibodies etc. Alternatively the inhibitory peptide can be grafted into such a protein based scaffold in order to enhance stability or improve stability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the compound or the name or structure of the compound is provided with an indication as to its use e.g., as determined by a screen described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method of manufacturing a compound identified by a screening method described herein according to any embodiment for use in medicine comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(i) performing a method as described herein according to any embodiment to thereby identify or determine a compound; and\n \n(ii) using the compound in the manufacture of a therapeutic for use in medicine.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn one example, the method comprises the additional step of isolating the compound. Alternatively, a compound is identified and is produced for use in the manufacture of a compound for use in medicine.\n\n\n \nFormulations\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides for the use of an inhibitor of the present invention as described according to any example hereof in the preparation of a medicament for treatment of a subject in need thereof e.g., for attenuation or alleviation or amelioration of an inappropriate or adverse humoral immune response, such as an immune response associated with or causative of an autoimmune disease. Alternatively, or in addition, the invention provides for use of an inhibitor of the present invention as described according to any example hereof in the preparation of a medicament for treatment for preventing or reducing an immune response against an antigen having a therapeutic or adaptive benefit to a subject. Alternatively, or in addition, the invention provides for use of an inhibitor of the present invention as described according to any example hereof in the preparation of a medicament for preventing or reducing a counter-adaptive immune response in a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound of the invention as described herein according to any embodiment is formulated for therapy or prophylaxis with a carrier or excipient e.g., suitable for inhalation or injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “carrier or excipient” as used herein, refers to a carrier or excipient that is conventionally used in the art to facilitate the storage, administration, and/or the biological activity of an active compound. A carrier may also reduce any undesirable side effects of the active compound. A suitable carrier is, for example, stable, e.g., incapable of reacting with other ingredients in the formulation. In one example, the carrier does not produce significant local or systemic adverse effect in recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed for treatment. Such carriers and excipients are generally known in the art. Suitable carriers for this invention include those conventionally used, e.g., water, saline, aqueous dextrose, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and glycols are preferred liquid carriers, particularly (when isotonic) for solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers and excipients include starch, cellulose, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, one or more alkylsaccharides, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled artisan will be aware of a suitable carrier or excipient. For example, a carrier or excipient does not inhibit the anti-inflammatory activity of a CD40L-dependent signaling inhibitor. In one example, the carrier or excipient permits the inhibitor to inhibit or reduce inflammation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations can be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical expedients, such as sterilization, and can contain a conventional pharmaceutical additive, such as a preservative and/or a stabilizing agent and/or a wetting agent and/or an emulsifying agent and/or a salt for adjusting osmotic pressure and/or a buffer and/or other additives known in the art. Other acceptable components in the composition of the invention include, but are not limited to, isotonicity-modifying agents such as water and/or saline and/or a buffer including phosphate, citrate, succinate, acetic acid, or other organic acids or their salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an example, a formulation includes one or more stabilizers, reducing agents, anti-oxidants and/or anti-oxidant chelating agents. The use of buffers, stabilizers, reducing agents, anti-oxidants and chelating agents in the preparation of compositions, is known in the art and described, for example, in Wang et al. \nJ. Parent. Drug Assn. \n34:452-462, 1980; Wang et al. \nJ. Parent. Sci. Tech. \n42:S4-S26 (Supplement), 1988. Suitable buffers include acetate, adipate, benzoate, citrate, lactate, maleate, phosphate, tartarate, borate, tri(hydroxymethyl aminomethane), succinate, glycine, histidine, the salts of various amino acids, or the like, or combinations thereof. Suitable salts and isotonicifiers include sodium chloride, dextrose, mannitol, sucrose, trehalose, or the like. Where the carrier is a liquid, it is preferred that the carrier is hypotonic or isotonic with oral, conjunctival, or dermal fluids and has a pH within the range of 4.5-8.5. Where the carrier is in powdered form, it is preferred that the carrier is also within an acceptable non-toxic pH range.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, a formulation as described herein according to any embodiment additionally comprises a compound that enhances or facilitates uptake of a compound. Suitable dermal permeation enhancers are, for example, a lipid disrupting agent (LDA), a solubility enhancer, or a surfactant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLDAs are typically fatty acid-like molecules proposed to fluidize lipids in the human skin membrane. Suitable LDAs are described, for example, in Francoeur et al., \nPharm. Res., \n7: 621-627, 1990 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,503,843. For example, a suitable LDA is a long hydrocarbon chain with a cis-unsaturated carbon-carbon double bond. These molecules have been shown to increase the fluidity of the lipids, thereby increasing drug transport. For example, oleic acid, oleyl alcohol, decanoic acid, and butene diol are useful LDAs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolubility enhancers act by increasing the maximum concentration of drug in a composition, thus creating a larger concentration gradient for diffusion. For example, a lipophilic vehicle isopropyl myristate (IPM) or an organic solvent ethanol or N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are suitable solubility enhancers (Liu et al., \nPharm. Res. \n8: 938-944, 1991; and Yoneto et al., \nJ. Pharm. Sci. \n84: 853-860, 1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurfactants are amphiphilic molecules capable of interacting with the polar and lipid groups in the skin. These molecules have affinity to both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups, which facilitate in traversing complex regions of the dermis. Suitable surfactants include, for example, an anionic surfactant lauryl sulfate (SDS) or a nonionic surfactant polysorbate 80 (Tween 80). Suitable surfactants are described, for example, in Sarpotdar et al., \nJ. Pharm. Sci. \n75: 176-181, 1986)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the formulation is a microemulsion. Microemulsion systems are useful for enhancing transdermal delivery of a compound. Characteristics of such microemulsion systems are sub-micron droplet size, thermodynamic stability, optical transparency, and solubility of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components. Microemulsion systems have been shown to be useful for transdermal delivery of compounds and to exhibit improved solubility of hydrophobic drugs as well as sustained release profiles (Lawrence, et. al. \nInt. Journal of Pharmaceutics \n111: 63-72, 1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, a formulation comprises a peptidyl moiety conjugated to a hydrolysable polyethylene glycol (PEG) essentially as described by Tsubery et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n279 (37) pp. 38118-38124. Alternatively, the formulation comprises a peptidyl moiety conjugated to hydroxyethyl starch (HES) or polyglycine or serum protein moiety or serum protein-binding moiety. Without being bound by any theory or mode of action, such formulations provide for extended or longer half-life of the peptide moiety in circulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, a formulation comprises a nanoparticle comprising the peptide moiety or other active ingredient bound to it or encapsulated within it. Without being bound by any theory or mode of action, delivery of a peptidyl composition from a nanoparticle may reduce renal clearance of the peptide(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, a formulation comprises a liposome carrier or excipient to facilitate uptake of an inhibitor into a cell. Liposomes are considered to interact with a cell by stable absorption, endocytosis, lipid transfer, and/or fusion (Egerdie et al., \nJ. Urol. \n142:390, 1989). For example, liposomes comprise molecular films, which fuse with cells and provide optimal conditions for wound healing (K. Reimer et al., \nDermatology \n195 (\nsuppl. \n2):93, 1999). Generally, liposomes have low antigenicity and can be used to encapsulate and deliver components that cause undesirable immune responses in patients (Natsume et al., \nJpn. J. Cancer Res. \n91:363-367, 2000)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, anionic or neutral liposomes often possess excellent colloidal stability, since substantially no aggregation occurs between the carrier and the environment. Consequently their biodistribution is excellent, and their potential for irritation and cytotoxicity is low.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, cationic liposomal systems, e.g. as described in Mauer et al., \nMolecular Membrane Biology, \n16: 129-140, 1999 or Maeidan et al., \nBBA \n1464: 251-261, 2000 are useful for delivering compounds into a cell. Such cationic systems provide high loading efficiencies. Moreover, PEGylated cationic liposomes show enhanced circulation times in vivo (Semple \nBBA \n1510, 152-166, 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmphoteric liposomes are a recently described class of liposomes having an anionic or neutral charge at pH 7.4 and a cationic charge at \npH\n 4. Examples of these liposomes are described, for example, in WO 02/066490, WO 02/066012 and WO 03/070735. Amphoteric liposomes have been found to have a good biodistribution and to be well tolerated in animals and they can encapsulate nucleic acid molecules with high efficiency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Ser. No. 09/738,046 and U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,797 describe liposomes suitable for the delivery of peptides or proteins into a cell.\n\n\n \nInjectable Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \nInjectable formulations comprising peptide(s) of the invention or other active ingredient and a suitable carrier or excipient preferably have improved stability and/or rapid onset of action, and are for intravenous, subcutaneous, intradermal or intramuscular injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor parenteral administration, the peptidyl component or other active ingredient, may be administered as injectable doses of a solution or suspension in a physiologically acceptable diluent with a pharmaceutical carrier which can be a sterile liquid such as water or oil e.g., petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic oil including any one or more of peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, etc. Surfactant and other pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants or excipients may be included. In general, water, saline, aqueous dextrose or other related sugar solution, ethanol or glycol e.g., polyethylene glycol or propylene glycol, is a preferred carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe injectable formulations may also contain a chelator e.g., EDTA, and/or a dissolution agent e.g., citric acid. Such components may assist rapid absorption of the active ingredient into the blood stream when administered by injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more solubilizing agents may be included in the formulation to promote dissolution in aqueous media. Suitable solubilizing agents include e.g., wetting agents such as polysorbates, glycerin, a poloxamer, non-ionic surfactant, ionic surfactant, food acid, food base e.g., sodium bicarbonate, or an alcohol. Buffer salts may also be included for pH control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStabilizers are used to inhibit or retard drug decomposition reactions in storage or in vivo which include, by way of example, oxidative reactions, hydrolysis and proteolysis. A number of stabilizers may be used e.g., protease inhibitors, polysaccharides such as cellulose and cellulose derivatives, and simple alcohols, such as glycerol; bacteriostatic agents such as phenol, m-cresol and methylparaben; isotonic agents, such as sodium chloride, glycerol, and glucose; lecithins, such as example natural lecithins (e.g. egg yolk lecithin or soya bean lecithin) and synthetic or semisynthetic lecithins (e.g. dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine or distearoyl-phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidic acids; phosphatidylethanolamines; phosphatidylserines such as distearoyl-phosphatidylserine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine and diarachidoylphospahtidylserine; phosphatidylglycerols; phosphatidylinositols; cardiolipins; sphingomyelins. In one example, the stabilizer may be a combination of glycerol, bacteriostatic agents and isotonic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the peptidyl component or other active ingredient of an injectable formulation is provided as a dry powder in a sterile vial or ampoule. This is mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient, and other components of the formulation shortly before or at the time of administration. Such an injectable formulation is produced by mixing components such as a carrier and/or excipient e.g., saline and/or glycerol and/or dissolution agent and/or chelator etc to form a solution to produce a “diluent”, and then and sterilizing the diluent e.g., by heat or filtration. The peptidyl component or other active agent is added separately to sterile water to form a solution, sterile-filtered, and a designated amount is placed into each of a number of separate sterile injection bottles. The peptide or other active agent solution is then lyophilized to form a powder and stored e.g., separately from the diluent to retain its stability. Prior to administration, the diluent is added to the injection bottle containing the dried peptidyl component or other active agent. After the predetermined amount of formulation is injected into the patient, the remaining solution may be stored, e.g., frozen or refrigerated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the formulation is prepared as a frozen mixture ready for use upon thawing. For example, the peptidyl component or other active agent is combined with the diluent, sterile filtered into multi-use injection bottles or ampoules and frozen prior to use.\n\n\n \nIntranasal Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \nFor intranasal administration, powdery preparations having improved absorbability have been proposed. They are prepared e.g., by adsorbing physiologically active linear peptides onto a polyvalent metal compound such as hydroxyapatite or calcium carbonate (e.g., \nEP\n 0 681 833 A2). Peptides can be cyclized to improve their stability and resistance to peptidases in the nasal mucosa e.g., by synthesis as a continuous cyclotide or by oxidation of flanking cysteine residues. Alternatively, peptides may be stabilized in a particular conformation by means of artificially ‘stapling’ using chemical linkers e.g., Walensky et al., Science 305, 1466-1470 (2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the peptide is dispersed homogeneously in and adsorbed homogeneously onto a physiologically acceptable particulate carrier, which can be a physiologically acceptable powdery or crystalline polyvalent metal carrier and/or organic carrier, whose mean particle size is in the range of 20 to 500 microns. In a preferred form, the peptidyl inhibitor according to any example hereof is formulated for intranasal delivery an alkyl-saccharide transmucosal delivery-enhancing excipient such as Intraveil (Aegis Therapeutics).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable polyvalent metal component of the carrier include physiologically acceptable metal compounds having more than 2 valency, and may include, for example, aluminum compounds, calcium compounds, magnesium compounds, silicon compounds, iron compounds and zinc compounds. Such metal compounds are commonly used as excipients, stabilizers, filing agents, disintegrants, lubricants, adsorbents and coating agents for medical preparations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred aluminum compounds include, for example, dry aluminum hydroxy gel, aluminum hydroxychloride, synthetic aluminum silicate, light aluminum oxide, colloidal aluminum silicate hydrate, aluminum magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide gel, aluminum sulfate, dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate, aluminum stearate, natural aluminum silicate, aluminum monostearate and potassium aluminum sulfate. Among them, the preferable aluminum compound is aluminum hydroxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred calcium compounds include, for example, apatite, hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate, calcium disodium EDTA, calcium chloride, calcium citrate, calcium glycerophosphate, calcium gluconate, calcium silicate, calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, calcium stearate, calcium phosphate tribasic, calcium lactate, calcium pantothenate, calcium oleate, calcium palmitate, calcium D-pantothenate, calcium alginate, calcium phosphate anhydride, calcium hydrogenphosphate, calcium primary phosphate, calcium acetate, calcium saccharate, calcium sulfate, calcium secondary phosphate, calcium para-aminosalicylate and bio-calcilutite compounds. Bio-calcilutite compounds such as crystalline calcium pyrophosphate, calcium secondary phosphate, octacalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate and crystalline calcium oxalate are analogous to hydroxyapatite and may also be used as a physiologically acceptable powdery or crystalline carrier. Preferable calcium compounds are hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate or calcium lactate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred magnesium compound components of the physiologically acceptable powdery or crystalline carrier include, for example, magnesium L-aspartate, magnesium chloride, magnesium gluconate, magnesium aluminate silicate, magnesium silicate, magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium stearate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium aluminate metasilicate, magnesium sulfate, sodium magnesium silicate and synthetic sodium magnesium silicate. Among them, preferable magnesium compound is magnesium stearate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther metal compounds with more than 2 valency may be silicon compounds such as silicon oxide hydrate, light silicic anhydride, synthetic hydrotalcite, diatomaceous earth and silicon dioxide; iron compounds such as ferrous sulfate; and zinc compounds such as zinc chloride, zinc stearate and zinc sulfate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticulate organic carriers may be a fine powder from grain, preferably of rice, wheat, buck wheat, barley, soybean, corn, millet, foxtail millet and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch formulations may optionally comprise an absorption enhancer. Preferred absorption enhancers which may be one of the components of the nasally administrable composition is a pharmaceutically acceptable natural (e.g. cellulose, starch and their derivatives) or unnatural polymer material. A preferred embodiment of the cellulose and its derivatives is microcrystalline cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate phthalate, carboxymethyl cellulose, low carboxymethyl cellulose sodium, carboxymethylethyl cellulose and the like. A preferable embodiment of the starch and its derivatives is corn starch, potato starch, rice starch, glutinous rice starch, wheat starch, pregelatinized starch, dextrin, sodium carboxymethyl starch, hydroxypropyl starch, pullulan and the like. Other natural polymers such as agar, sodium alginate, chitin, chitosan, egg yolk lecithin, gum arabic, tragacanth, gelatine, collagen, casein, albumin, fibrinogen, and fibrin may also be used as absorption enhancer. A preferable embodiment of the unnatural polymer is sodium polyacrylate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and the like. Preferred absorption enhancers are fine powder of rice, glutinous rice, starch, gelatine, dextrin, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, egg yolk lecithin, gum arabic, tragacanth or a mixture thereof. More preferable absorption enhancers are fine powder of glutinous rice, starch, gelatine, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, tragacanth or a mixture thereof. Even more preferable absorption enhancers are fine powder of glutinous rice or hydroxypropyl cellulose. Most preferable absorption enhancer is fine powder of glutinous rice. The mean particle size of the absorption enhancer is preferably not more than 250 microns, more preferably from 20 to 180 microns.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above absorption enhancers may be used alone or in combination of two or more absorption enhancers in the physiologically acceptable powdery or crystalline carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWater-soluble carriers are preferred to increase adsorption of the active substance in the nasal mucosa. Alternatively, this is achieved by homogeneous dispersion of the active substance in a water-insoluble carrier e.g., hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate, calcium lactate, aluminum hydroxide or magnesium stearate, preferably in the presence of an absorption enhancer, and homogeneously adsorbing the active substance there onto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCalcium carbonate, calcium lactate, aluminum hydroxide or magnesium stearate is usually used as a stabilizer, lubricant, agent to add lustre, excipient, dispersing agent or coating agent for a pharmaceutical preparation; however, it has been found that these compounds having a mean particle size of not more than 500 microns can be used as a carrier for the intranasal formulations, and promote absorption of a physiologically active substances into the body by nasal administration.\n\n\n \nAdditional Components\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another example of the invention, a formulation comprises an additional component or compound e.g., a cytokine or growth factor, such as, for example, an interleukin e.g., IL-2 or IL-8, IL-10, IL-13 or IL-17 and/or an interferon molecule e.g., IFN-α or IFN-β or IFN-γ or IFN-λ and/or transforming growth factor β and/or platelet derived growth factor and/or nerve growth factor and/or heparin binding epidermal growth factor and/or epidermal growth factor and/or keratinocyte growth factor and/or platelet derived activating factor and/or platelet derived epithelial growth factor and/or a fibroblast growth factor an/or a keratinocyte growth factor. For example, Puolakkainen et al., \nJ. Surg. Res., \n58: 321-329, 1995 describe formulations comprising transforming growth factor β; compositions comprising platelet derived growth factor have been described by Lepisto et al., \nJ. Surg. Res., \n53: 596-601, 1992; formulations comprising fibroblast growth factor are described, for example, in Brown et al., \nSurg., \n121: 372-380, 1997; formulations comprising nerve growth factor are described in, for example, Matsuda et al., \nJ. Exp. Med., \n187: 297-306, 1998.\n\n\n \nModes of Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention contemplates any mode of administration of a medicament or formulation as described herein, however one or a plurality of intranasal and/or injected and/or oral doses is preferred. Combinations of different administration routes are also encompassed e.g., intranasal and/or intravenous and/or oral.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions according to the present invention are administered in an aqueous solution as a nasal or pulmonary spray and may be dispensed in spray form by a variety of methods known to those skilled in the art. Preferred systems for dispensing liquids as a nasal spray are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,511,069. Such formulations may be conveniently prepared by dissolving compositions according to the present invention in water to produce an aqueous solution, and rendering the solution sterile. The formulations may be presented in multi-dose containers, for example in the sealed dispensing system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,511,069. Other suitable nasal spray delivery systems have been described in Transdermal Systemic Medication, Y. W. Chien Ed., Elsevier Publishers, New York, 1985; and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,778,810 (each incorporated herein by reference). Additional aerosol delivery forms may include, e.g., compressed air-, jet-, ultrasonic-, and piezoelectric nebulizers, which deliver the biologically active agent dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutical solvent, e.g., water, ethanol, or a mixture thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNasal and pulmonary spray solutions of the present invention typically comprise the drug or drug to be delivered, optionally formulated with a surface active agent, such as a nonionic surfactant (e.g., polysorbate-80), and one or more buffers. In some embodiments of the present invention, the nasal spray solution further comprises a propellant. The pH of the nasal spray solution is optionally between about pH 6.8 and 7.2, but when desired the pH is adjusted to optimize delivery of a charged macromolecular species (e.g., a therapeutic protein or peptide) in a substantially non-ionized state. The pharmaceutical solvents employed can also be a slightly acidic aqueous buffer (pH 4-6). Suitable buffers for use within these compositions are as described above or as otherwise known in the art. Other components may be added to enhance or maintain chemical stability, including preservatives, surfactants, dispersants, or gases. Suitable preservatives include, but are not limited to, phenol, methyl paraben, paraben, m-cresol, thiomersal, benzylalkonimum chloride, and the like. Suitable surfactants include, but are not limited to, oleic acid, sorbitan trioleate, polysorbates, lecithin, phosphotidyl cholines, and various long chain diglycerides and phospholipids. Suitable dispersants include, but are not limited to, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and the like. Suitable gases include, but are not limited to, nitrogen, helium, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), carbon dioxide, air, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithin alternate embodiments, mucosal formulations are administered as dry powder formulations comprising the biologically active agent in a dry, usually lyophilized, form of an appropriate particle size, or within an appropriate particle size range, for intranasal delivery. Minimum particle size appropriate for deposition within the nasal or pulmonary passages is often about 0.5 micron mass median equivalent aerodynamic diameter (MMEAD), commonly about 1 micron MMEAD, and more typically about 2 micron MMEAD. Maximum particle size appropriate for deposition within the nasal passages is often about 10 micron MMEAD, commonly about 8 micron MMEAD, and more typically about 4 micron MMEAD. Intranasally respirable powders within these size ranges can be produced by a variety of conventional techniques, such as jet milling, spray drying, solvent precipitation, supercritical fluid condensation, and the like. These dry powders of appropriate MMEAD can be administered to a patient via a conventional dry powder inhaler (DPI) which rely on the patient's breath, upon pulmonary or nasal inhalation, to disperse the power into an aerosolized amount. Alternatively, the dry powder may be administered via air assisted devices that use an external power source to disperse the powder into an aerosolized amount, e.g., a piston pump.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDry powder devices typically require a powder mass in the range from about 1 mg to 20 mg to produce a single aerosolized dose (“puff”). If the required or desired dose of the biologically active agent is lower than this amount, the powdered active agent will typically be combined with a pharmaceutical dry bulking powder to provide the required total powder mass. Preferred dry bulking powders include sucrose, lactose, dextrose, mannitol, glycine, trehalose, human serum albumin (HSA), starch e.g., hydroxyethyl starch (HES). Other suitable dry bulking powders include cellobiose, dextrans, maltotriose, pectin, sodium citrate, sodium ascorbate, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStandard methods are used to administer injectable formulations of the present invention.\n\n\n \nMedical Indications\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention can be used for treatment or prophylaxis of any mammalian subject in need of, or already receiving, therapy for one or more consequences of aberrant or inappropriate CD40L-dependent signaling, including CD40L-dependent CD40-mediated signaling or CD40L-mediated signaling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, an inhibitor of the present invention as described according to any example hereof is for treatment or therapy of a subject in need thereof e.g., for attenuation or alleviation or amelioration of an inappropriate or adverse humoral immune response, such as an immune response associated with or causative of an autoimmune disease. Alternatively, or in addition, an inhibitor of the present invention as described according to any example hereof is for preventing or reducing an immune response against an antigen having a therapeutic or adaptive benefit to a subject. Alternatively, or in addition, an inhibitor of the present invention as described according to any example hereof is for use in a method to prevent or reduce a counter-adaptive immune response in a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “treatment” or “therapy” means to improve a subject's clinical state e.g., by reducing, alleviating, ameliorating or preventing one or more adverse indications of a disease, condition or syndrome. The treatment or therapy may involve complete abrogation of adverse indication(s) or comprise a partial improvement therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, an inhibitor of the present invention as described according to any example hereof is for therapy of an autoimmune disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “autoimmune disease” describes a disease state or syndrome whereby a subject's body produces a dysfunctional immune response against the subject's own body components, with adverse effects. This may include production of B cells producing antibodies with specificity for all antigens, allergens or major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens, or it may include production of T cells bearing receptors that recognize self-components and produce cytokines that cause inflammation. Examples of autoimmune diseases include, but are not limited to, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia, autoimmune gastritis, psoriasis, Bechet's disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, Sarcoidois, autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune oophoritis, bullous pemphigoid, phemphigus, polyendocrinopathies, Still's disease, Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome, myasthenia gravis, Goodpasture's syndrome, autoimmune orchitis, autoimmune uveitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, Sjogren's Syndrome and ankylosing spondylitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the autoimmune disease is rheumatoid arthritis e.g., wherein the inhibitor reduces or prevents CD40L-dependent induction of anti-collagen antibodies. In another example, the autoimmune disease is type I diabetes. In another example, the autoimmune disease is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) e.g., wherein the inhibitor reduces or prevents CD40L-dependent anti-dsDNA and anti-nucleosomal autoantibody production. In another example, the autoimmune disease is multiple sclerosis e.g., wherein the inhibitor reduces or prevents CD40L-dependent anti-myelin autoantibody production.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, an inhibitor of the present invention as described according to any example hereof is for therapy of inflammation e.g., inflammation associated with an autoimmune disease, periodic fever syndrome, sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, an inhibitor of the present invention as described according to any example hereof is for therapy of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, an inhibitor of the present invention as described according to any example hereof is for therapy of irritable bowel syndrome/disease (IBD).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, an inhibitor of the present invention as described according to any example hereof is for therapy of one or more CD40L-dependent vascular complication of diabetes e.g., cardiac ischemia, atherosclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention as described according to any example hereof is for reducing the risk of complication of transplantation by blocking a CD40L regulated process involved in graft rejection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, an inhibitor of the present invention as described according to any example hereof attenuates or ameliorates bio-inhibitory humoral immunity against one or more therapeutic proteins e.g., thrombin, clotting factor such as factor VIII, one or more cytokines e.g., an interleukin (IL) such as IL-2 or an interferon (IFN) such as IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ or IFN-λ. For example, in the therapy of hemophilia, subjects at risk of developing humoral immunity to factor VIII may be treated with an inhibitor of the present invention. Similarly, subjects suffering from an autoimmune disease e.g., multiple sclerosis, or a viral infection e.g., HCV infection and receiving interferon therapy may be treated with an inhibitor of the present invention. Procedures for determining whether a subject has developed an inhibitory response against a therapeutic peptide are well known e.g., Hematology: Clinical and Laboratory Practice, vol. 2, Bick, ed., Mosby-Year Book, Inc., publ. (1993), pp. 1544-1548.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject will be a mammalian animal, e.g., a human or non-human animal, such as a domesticated non-human mammal, including a companion or laboratory mammal, e.g., selected from chimpanzees, monkeys, sheep, horses, cattle, goats, pigs, dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, gerbils, rats and mice. For example, the subject may be a subject afflicted with, or at risk of, developing an autoimmune disease or other CD40L-dependent condition such as an exogenous protein inhibitor syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is described further in the following non-limiting examples:\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nIsolation and Characterization of Representative Peptidyl Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example provides representative peptidyl inhibitors of the present invention and describes methods for their isolation and validation. Additional peptidyl inhibitors of the invention are provided in the basic application, incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \nPeptide Display\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing phage display, expression libraries produced from fragments of prokaryote and eukaryote compact genomes, including \nSalmonella enterica, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria innocua, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, Thermotoga maritima, Sulfolobus solfataricus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Deinococcus radiodurans, Campylobacter jejuni, Geobacter sulfurreducens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bordetella pertussis, Haloarcula marismortui \nand \nChlorobium tepidum\n. The genome fragments inserted into the phage display libraries encode peptides, including natural open reading frames, capable of forming secondary structures or super-secondary structures (including folds, domains and sub-domains of proteins). Because the fragments are derived from prokaryotes or non-mammalian eukaryotes having compact genomes, the encoded peptides do not bind CD40L in their native context.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides were displayed in trans with the p3 protein from the vector pJuFo. Alternatively, the peptides were displayed as fusion proteins with the p3 protein, wherein nucleic acid encoding the peptidyl inhibitor was positioned downstream of a PelB leader sequence and upstream of a sequence encoding an HA-p3 fusion moiety, and wherein the vector was configured such that the proportion of natural open reading frames displayed in the PelB-peptidyl inhibitor-HA-p3 fusion peptide is enhanced.\n\n\n \nBase Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nIn primary biopanning with CD40L, the inventors identified peptides that bind to CD40L. Table 2 provides the sequences of representative base peptides i.e., SEQ ID Nos: 1-18.\n\n\n \nModification of Base Peptides by Removal of Internal Cysteine Residues\n\n\n \n \n \nThe sequences of the base peptides having internal or C-terminal cysteine residues were modified by synthesizing the peptides with a serine residues in place of the cysteine. The sequences of the derivative peptides are provided in Table 3 i.e., SEQ ID Nos: 19-34.\n\n\n \nChiral Analogs of Base Peptides and Serine Derivatives\n\n\n \n \n \nThe inventors have also produced retro-inverted analogs of the base peptides comprising e.g., two or more retro-inverted amino acids and preferably, comprising a reversed amino acid sequence wherein all amino other than glycine (which is not chiral) are D-amino acids. The amino acid sequences of representative chiral analogs are set forth in Table 4 i.e., SEQ ID Nos: 35-43.\n\n\n \nModification of Base Peptides by Directed Evolution\n\n\n \n \n \nThe inventors have also produced multimeric forms of the peptides comprising one or two or three CD40L peptide ligands of the invention. In one example, a recombinase-based system of the present invention is used to produce the multimeric peptides. In another example, cysteine-containing linkers have been added to the peptides as described in the preceding paragraph and the peptides have been dimerized by chemical oxidation of the sulfhydryl group on the terminal cysteine residue e.g., using aldrithiol-2. Homodimers and heterodimers have been produced and assayed by chemiluminescent proximity assay for their ability to inhibit CD40L-CD40 interaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, homodimers and heterodimers comprising the \npeptide CD40LM1\n \n \n \n—\n6 were produced, including heterodimers comprising the \npeptide CD40LM1\n \n \n \n—\n6 and a peptide selected from \nCD40LM1\n \n \n \n—\n4, \nCD40LM1\n \n \n \n—\n9, and \nCD40LM7\n \n \n \n—\n189.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, peptide monomers are separated by tetra-glycine spacer or linker. A representative sequence of a heterodimeric peptide is presented in Table 2 (SEQ ID No: 44), which comprises the CD40L M1\n—\n206 monomer fused to a second peptidyl inhibitory monomer via a tetra-glycine spacer.\n\n\n \nModification of Base Peptides by Addition of PEG Moiety\n\n\n \n \n \nThe inventors have also produced, or will produce, derivatives of the peptides and analogs set forth in Tables 2 to 4 (SEQ ID Nos: 1-44) comprising polyethylene glycol or “PEG” (i.e., PEGylated peptides) added to their N-termini.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe N-terminal PEG residues may be separated from the peptidyl inhibitor by a linker or spacer. The linker or spacer may be e.g., an 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl linker, an 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl cysteine spacer, an 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl lysine spacer, an 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl lysyl cysteine spacer, or 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl lysyl-lysyl-cysteine spacer. Exemplary spacers lined to the N-terminus of a peptide are represented schematically in \nFIGS. 1\n \na \nto \n1\n \nc\n. Exemplary peptide dimers separated by spacers are represented schematically in \nFIGS. 1\n \nd \nand \n1\n \ne. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary PEGylated peptides are set forth in Tables 2 to 4 hereof i.e., the peptides for which kinetic data are provided.\n\n\n \nCompetitive Inhibition of Binding to CD40L\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a primary validation assay, the ability of base peptides to bind specifically to CD40L was confirmed by demonstrating that soluble CD40L was able to compete with the peptide displayed by the phage for binding to bound CD40L. In particular, CD40L-binding activity of phage displaying the peptides was inhibited by soluble CD40L with IC\n50 \nvalues of less than 500 nM. Representative data obtained in such assays are presented in \nFIG. 2\n for peptides CD40L M2\n—\n74, CD40L M2\n—\n82, CD40L M2\n—\n83 and CD40L M2\n—\n85. The IC\n50 \nvalues of a sub-set of exemplary peptidyl inhibitors of the invention i.e., \npeptides CD40L M1\n \n \n \n—\n6, \nCD40L M1\n \n \n \n—\n9, CD40L M1\n—\n18, and \nCD40L M1\n \n \n \n—\n50, are also presented in Table 2 hereof.\n\n\n \nDetermination of Association and Dissociation Constants\n\n\n \n \n \nLabel-free analyses of the associations and dissociations of base peptides and serine derivatives of base peptides with the CD40L target protein were performed using the Octet Red system (ForteBio, Inc., USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These analyses provide kinetic constants of CD40L binding activity, especially the association rate constant (K\na\n) and dissociation rate constant (K\nd\n) of binding, i.e., measures of the “on” and “off” rates of the peptides relative to soluble CD40L.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe equilibrium dissociation constant values (K\nD\n) are presented in Tables 2 and 3. Data show that the higher affinity CD40L-binding peptides are generally encoded by natural open reading frames of bacteria or eukaryotes having compact genomes e.g., peptides CD40L M8\n—\n720, CD40L M8\n—\n721, CD40L M8\n—\n747, CD40L M8\n—\n748, CD40L M9\n—\n763, CD40L M9\n—\n780, CD40L M9\n—\n789 (SEQ ID Nos: 12-18), supporting the hypothesis that protein domains have evolved in these organisms to form stable structures. However, high affinity CD40L-binding peptides were also derived from display in pJuFo e.g., \npeptides CD40L M1\n \n \n \n—\n6, \nCD40L M1\n \n \n \n—\n9, CD40L M1\n—\n18 and CD40L M1\n—\n42 (SEQ ID Nos: 1-3 and 5). For those peptides that were modified by substitution of cysteine residues for serine residues, the binding affinity as determined by dissociation constant in the Octet Red assay was generally reduced e.g., compare K\nD \nvalues for peptides in Table 3 to data in Table 2, again supporting the hypothesis that natural open readings represent structures optimized in nature.\n\n\n \nChemiluminescent Proximity Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe specificities of the interactions between CD40L and of base peptides or serine derivatives of base peptides or chiral analogs of base peptides, were also demonstrated by chemiluminescent proximity assay employing (i) streptavidin-coated beads; (ii) a biotinylated phospho-CD40L; and (iii) protein A-conjugated beads having bound thereto CD40 receptor (CD40), wherein the biotinylated phospho-CD40L is captured by the streptavidin-coated donor beads via biotin-streptavidin interaction, and then specific peptides and protein A-conjugated CD40 acceptor beads are added. When the CD40L-CD40 interaction occurs, excitation at 680 nm produces an emission at wavelengths in the range of about 520 nm to about 620 nm. If the interaction is inhibited by the peptides, then emission in the 520-620 nm range is reduced or inhibited.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the Alphascreen assay (PerkinElmer) was employed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alphascreen data presented herein demonstrate that peptides of the invention have high affinities for CD40L and are able to inhibit CD40-CD40L interactions in the nanomolar concentration range. Representative data obtained in Alphascreen assays are presented in \nFIGS. 3\n \na\n-\n3\n \nd \nhereof for \npeptides CD40LM1\n \n \n \n—\n6; \nCD40LM1\n \n \n \n—\n4; \nCD40LM1_CD40LM1\n \n \n \n—\n9; and \nCD40LM7\n \n \n \n—\n189.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData presented in Tables 2 and 3 and 4 hereof show the EC\n50 \nvalues (i.e., the concentration producing a 50% reduction in control emission at 520-620 nm) for monomeric non-PEGylated (unmodified) and monomeric PEGylated base peptides, serine derivatives and chiral analogs. These data shown that the affinity of binding to CD40L to inhibit the CD40-CD40L interaction is generally enhanced for serine derivative and chiral analogs compared to the base peptides, and that PEGylated chiral analogs may exhibit even higher affinity for CD40L in the inhibition of the CD40-CD40L interaction. Representative data provided in \nFIG. 4\n for peptide CD40L M1\n—\n18 support this conclusion, because the PEGylated chiral analog has a significantly higher affinity of binding than the core peptide or the retroinverted form alone, as evidenced by a reduced EC\n50 \nvalue for the PEGylated chiral analog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHomodimers and heterodimers were also assayed by chemiluminescent proximity assay for their ability to inhibit CD40L-CD40 interaction. Data shown in Table 5 and \nFIGS. 5\n \na\n-\n5\n \ne \nhereof for exemplary dimeric forms of the CD40L peptide ligands of the invention demonstrate a significantly higher affinity of binding than a corresponding monomeric peptide, in the chemiluminescent proximity assay. Data presented in Table 2 for SEQ ID NO: 44 also demonstrate a 6-fold higher affinity for CD40L than the base monomeric peptide CD40L M1\n—\n206 which forms the N-terminal moiety of the heterodimer.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase peptidyl inhibitors and kinetic characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n

\nTo further validate the CD40L peptide antagonists identified by the inventors, bioassays are performed which determine the ability of a peptide of the invention or an analog or derivative thereof to inhibit or antagonize one or more CD40L-dependent biological activities known in the art.\n\n\n \n1. Inhibition of Cd86 Expression on Primary B Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one example, the ability of a peptide, analog or derivative of the invention to inhibit or reduce or delay expression of CD86 on primary B-cells was determined in the presence and absence of the peptides, analogs and derivatives of the invention. In particular, CD86 expression was determined by FACS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative data presented in Table 6, and in \nFIGS. 6\n \na \nand \n6\n \nb \ndemonstrate the ability of the monomeric peptide designated M1\n—\n18 to inhibit CD40L-induced expression of CD86 on primary B-cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC\n50 \nof less than 0.5 μM. Similar results were obtained for a variant of the peptide having a C-terminal serine residue i.e., peptide M1\n—18\nS, for which the EC50 value was about 7.426×10-7 M (\nFIG. 5\n \ne\n). In contrast, a control peptide that does not function as a peptidyl inhibitor of the invention failed to provide significant concentration-dependent inhibition at micromolar concentrations (\nFIG. 6\n \nc\n). In these assays, CD40L induced CD86 expression in a concentration-dependent manner in the absence of a peptidyl inhibitor of the present invention with an EC\n50 \nvalue of about 9 nM (\nFIG. 6\n \nd\n, \n6\n \ne\n). As a control in these assays, LPS-induced expression of CD86 mediated by the Toll-\nlike receptors TLR\n 2/4, and TNFα-induced cytoxicity, were also assayed to exclude effects mediated by ligands other than CD40L. As shown in \nFIGS. 6\n \nf \nand \n6\n \ng\n, no significant inhibition of LPS-induced CD86 expression was detected for peptide M1\n—\n18S and, as shown in \nFIGS. 6\n \nh\n-\n6\n \nj\n, none of the peptides designated M1\n—\n2S, M1\n—\n4S, M1\n—\n6S, M1\n—\n7S, M1\n—\n9S or M1\n—\n18S provided significant inhibition of rTNFα-induced cytoxicity.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of CD40L-CD40 interaction by monomeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeptides as determined by inhibition of CD40L-induced\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD86 expression on primary B-cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEC\n50 \nunmodified\n\n\nEC\n50 \nPEGylated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPeptide\n\n\npeptide (nM)\n\n\npeptide (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nM1_6S\n\n\n \n\n\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nM1_9S\n\n\n \n\n\n180\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nM1-\n18S\n \n\n\n \n\n\n90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nM1_30S\n\n\n \n\n\n>2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nM1_42S\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nM1_50S\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nM1_82rd\n\n\n \n\n\n470\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nM7_206rd\n\n\n \n\n\n2,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nM7_217\n\n\n2,500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nS denotes C-terminal serine;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys denotes N-terminal cysteine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a similar series of bioassays, dimeric forms of the CD40L peptide inhibitors were also tested for their ability to inhibit or reduce CD40L-induced expression of CD86 on primary B-cells.

T-Cell Proliferation Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nAn antigen-specific T-cell proliferation assay was used to measure the ability of anti-CD40L-peptides to inhibit CD40L receptor activity displayed natively on the surface of T cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, pooled DLN (consisting parathymic and posterior mediastinal nodes) were collected from transgenic D011.10 mice engineered to express ovalbumin-specific T cell receptors (TCRs). Enriched T-cell suspensions were prepared and stimulated with 10 μg/ml ovalbumin in the presence or absence of 10 μM or 20 μM concentration of anti-CD40L peptidyl inhibitors. The peptides tested were PEGylated serine derivatives and/or chiral analogs of \npeptides CD40L M1\n \n \n \n—\n6, \nCD40L M1\n \n \n \n—\n9, CD40L M1\n—\n18, \nCD40L M1\n \n \n \n—\n30, CD40L M1\n—\n42, \nCD40L M1\n \n \n \n—\n50, CD40L M7\n—\n82 and CD40L M7\n—\n206. Cells were cultured for 24-72 hrs and then pulsed with [\n3\nH]thymidine for another 24 hr to measure T-cell proliferation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative data indicate that, compared to positive control assays i.e., lacking inhibitory peptide, the peptides tested provided about 30% to about 75% inhibition of T-cell proliferation. Te best-performing peptidyl inhibitors in this assay were PEGylated chiral analogs of CD40L M1\n—\n30s and CD40L M1\n—\n42s. In general, PEGylated chiral analogs of serine derivatives performed better than PEGylated serine derivatives."

No. 61/382,485, filed Sep. 13, 2010; all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present disclosure relates to the field of tyrosine kinase enzyme inhibition, in particular anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibition using novel small molecules. Provided are compounds capable to modulate ALK activity, compositions that comprise the compounds, and methods of using the compounds for the treatment or prevention of diseases or conditions that are characterized by ALK activity or expression.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the insulin receptor superfamily and is normally expressed in neural tissues during embryogenesis (Morris et al., \nOncogene, \n1997, 14:2175-2188; Iwahara et al., \nOncogene, \n1997, 14:439-449). In particular, transcripts of ALK gene are highly expressed in specific regions of the central nervous system, including the diencephalon, midbrain, and the ventral half of the spinal cord. In the peripheral nervous system, ALK expression has been detected in the trigeminal, sympathetic, and enteric ganglia. After birth, expression diminishes, but still persists in certain areas such as the olfactory bulb and thalamus. Despite the apparent function of ALK in the development of the nervous system, the physiologic role of ALK is still largely unclear. While the recent studies are proposing that pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine (MK) are cognate ligands for ALK (Stoica et al., \nJ Biol Chem, \n2001, 276(20):16772-16779; Stoica et al., \nJ Biol Chem, \n2002, 277(16):14153-14158), exact mechanisms and biological consequences of ligand-dependent ALK activation are not fully understood at this time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nALK was initially identified because of its involvement in the human non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype known as anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Many cases of ALCL are associated with a reciprocal translocation, t(2;5)(p23;q35), which juxtaposes the gene at 5q35 encoding nucleophosmin (NPM), a nucleolar-associated phosphoprotein, with the gene for a receptor tyrosine kinase, the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), at 2p23. The resulting fusion gene encodes a chimeric 80-kD protein in which 40% of the N-terminal portion of NPM is fused to the complete intracytoplasmic portion of ALK containing the functional tyrosine kinase domain (Morris et al., \nScience, \n1994, 263:1281-1284). Constitutive activation of the NPM-ALK kinase domain stimulates anti-apoptotic and mitogenic signaling pathways such as PI3K-AKT, JAK-STAT, and PLCγ, resulting in cellular transformation (Bai, 1998; Slupianek, 2001; Zamo 2002). The transforming activity of NPM/ALK is dependent on its kinase activity (Bischof 1997). While the most frequently occurring oncogenic ALK fusion in ALK-positive ALCL cases (“ALKomas”) is the NPM-ALK (˜80% of ALK-positive ALCL cases), other ALK gene fusions have been consequently identified in human hematological and solid cancers. These include TPM3-ALK (fusion of \nnon-muscle tropomyosin\n 3 with ALK), TPM4-ALK, ATIC-ALK, CLTC-ALK, RanBP2-ALK, TFGL/S-ALK, CARS-ALK, MSN-ALK and others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll known ALK fusion proteins (These include ALK-positive ALCL, NPM-ALK, TPM3-ALK (fusion of \nnon-muscle tropomyosin\n 3 with ALK), TPM4-ALK, ATIC-ALK, CLTC-ALK, RanBP2-ALK, TFGL/S-ALK, CARS-ALK, MSN-ALK and others) share the essential feature of having some type of the oligomerization domain in the sequence of the ALK fusion partner which mediates constituitive self-association of the ALK fusion that causes constant, ligand-independent ALK kinase domain activation. Similarly to NPM-ALK, the related ALK fusion proteins have been shown to possess transforming and oncogenic potential, apparently mediated by their constitutive kinase activity. Although ALK-positive lymphomas have a relatively benign prognosis, about 40% of patients do not respond or relapse after the standard therapy (CHOP). CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydoxorubicin, oncovin, prednisone) and CHOP-like multi-agent combination chemotherapy regimens that are used for conventional treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphomas including ALCL are associated with considerable acute and chronic toxicities, a problem specifically bothersome in pediatric patients. Therefore, a highly effective and targeted therapy would be beneficial and highly warranted not only for relapsed patients but also as first-line therapy if well tolerated and efficacious.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to ALKomas, several research groups have also described the presence of the NPM-ALK and the related fusion proteins like CLTC-ALK in a rare form of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Rearrangements of ALK gene have been also identified in the inflammatory fibroblastic tumors (IMT). These rare spindle cell proliferations involve malignant myofibroblasts and infiltrating non-malignant inflammatory cells in a collagenous matrix and occur primarily in the soft tissue of children and young adults.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore recently, a novel oncogenic ALK fusion, EML4-ALK, comprising portions of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene, has been implicated in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Soda, 2007). Mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells forced to express this fusion tyrosine kinase generated transformed foci in culture and subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. The EML4-ALK fusion transcript was detected in 6.7% of the 75 NSCLC patients examined; these individuals were distinct from those harboring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. Presence of the oncogenic TPM4-ALK fusion was also detected by proteomics methods in esophageal cancer samples from patients in Iran (Jazii, 2006) and China (Du, 2007). These findings strongly suggest that EML4-ALK and TPM4-ALK fusions are promising candidates for a therapeutic target in a sizable subset of NSCLC and possibly in some esophageal carcinomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain additional facts concerning the possible relevance of deregulated full-length ALK signaling in some types of cancer and utility of the non-rearranged, full-length ALK as a therapeutic target are noteworthy. The small secreted growth factors pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine (MK) have been shown to activate signaling of the normal, full-length ALK receptor protein (Stoica et al., 2001, supra; Stoica et al., 2002, supra). While the exact mechanism and biological significance of ALK stimulation by the different molecular forms of these ligands are not completely understood at this time (Lu, 2005; Perez-Pinera, 2007), a functional connection between PTN and/or midkine and ALK is well established. A large number of studies provide evidence that PTN and MK contribute to tumor growth, abnormal tumor-associated angiogenesis and metastasis (Kadamatsu, 2004; Bernard-Pierrot 2002). For example, both PTN and ALK have been found to be overexpressed in human glioblastomas, and downregulation of ALK expression by ribozymes was shown to suppress human glioblastoma xenograft growth in mice and to prolong the survival of the tumor-bearing animals (Powers 2002; Grzhelinsky 2005). Expression or overexpression of the full-length ALK receptor in certain neuroblastomas, diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, leiomyosarcomas, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath sarcomas have been reported (Pullford et al., \nJ Cell Physiol, \n2004, 199:330-358). Similarly, it has been reported that cell lines established from common solid tumors of ectodermal origin, such as melanoma and breast cancer, exhibit ALK receptor mRNA expression (Pulford, 2004, supra). Additional analyses should elucidate the role of ALK signaling in the genesis and progression of these various cancers over the next few years.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies in which the mouse Alk gene was knocked-out demonstrate that ALK-negative mice show no evident gross anatomical, histological or functional abnormalities and have a normal lifespan (Pulford, 2004, supra). Therefore, the physiological functions of Alk, which is normally expressed primarily in neural tissues, appear to be largely redundant. These observations suggest that therapeutic approaches targeting the aberrant oncogenic functions of ALK are not likely to be associated with limiting toxicities due to concomitant inhibition of normal ALK functions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, both the various cytoplasmic ALK fusion proteins and the full-length ALK in its transmembrane receptor form are valid molecular targets for anticancer drugs. Consequently, small-molecule inhibitors of ALK kinase are likely to be a drug for suppressing of tumor growth and angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently reported preclinical studies have provided compelling proof of principle for the efficacy of the inhibition of NPM-ALK in ALK-positive ALCL, with marked anti-tumor activity observed experimentally. For instance, studies performed by Novartis demonstrated regression of established lymphoma tumors formed by subcutaneous injection of the human NPM-ALK-positive ALCL cell line Karpas-299 in mice when the animals were treated with the small molecule ALK kinase inhibitor NVP-TAE684 (Galkin, 2007).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther experimental approaches for the inhibition of oncogenic ALK signaling have also indicated that the agents blocking this signaling are likely to possess very potent anti-cancer capabilities. Piva and colleagues recently showed that siRNA (small inhibitory ribonucleic acid)-mediated inhibition of NPM-ALK signaling markedly diminished the development of ALCL xenografts in mice (Piva, 2006). Collectively, these data indicate that the inhibition of the aberrant, cancer-causing activity of ALK fusion proteins in ALCL, as well as other ALK-driven malignancies, using small molecule inhibitors is very likely to produce marked anti-tumor responses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO 2004/063151 reported a tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity of pyridones. Pyrroloquinixalinediones and their derivatives were shown to exhibit HIV integrase inhibitory activity (WO2004/096807).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnly a few inhibitors with activity against ALK have been reported. Sauville (Sauville et al, \nJ. Clin. Oncol., \n2001, 19, 2319-2333) disclosed a derivative of the natural product staurosporine having an anti-tumor activity in a patient with an ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma that was refractory to conventional chemo- and radio-therapy. It is important to note that the compound's ability to inhibit ALK was not tested in this study, thus, it has not been formally proven that it is an ALK inhibitor. Indeed, a recent report suggests that staurosporine possesses minimal ability to directly inhibit ALK (Gunby et al., \nHaematologica, \n2005, 90, 988-990). The naturally occurring, structurally related benzoquinone analogues, geldanamycin and 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (Bonvini et al., \nCancer. Res. \n2002, 62, 1559-1566) and herbimycin A (Turturro et al., \nClin. Cancer Res. \n2002, 8, 240-245) have been reported to exert ALK inhibition via heat shock protein pathways, enhancing the proteasome-mediated degradation of the ALK protein. Most recently, a series of pyrazolo[3,4-c]isoquinoline derivatives with ALK-inhibitory activity was published in WO 2005009389.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of the challenges of developing an ATP-competitive small-molecule ALK inhibitor is to provide sufficient selectivity of the compound for ALK versus inhibition of other structurally related protein kinases. Due to the existence of about 520 evolutionary related protein kinases in the human genome, this could be a demanding task. In particular, inhibition of the insulin receptor kinase which is closely structurally related to ALK is highly undesirable due to the risk of blocking insulin action and the resultant hyperglycemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother highly related RTK is Insulin-Like Growth Factor Receptor I (IGF1R). In the recent years, IGF1R emerged as an attractive oncology target in a broad variety of malignancies (Riedman and Macaulay, 2006; Tao et al. 2007). However, suppression of IGF1R signaling may potentially have undesirable side-effects in a clinical context where normal cell/tissue proliferation and development are essential, such as treating pediatric patients (ALCL). Therefore, a sufficiently high selectivity of ALK inhibition versus inhibition of such related RTKs as Insulin Receptor and IGF1R is likely to be a desirable trait in a clinical ALK inhibitor. Conversely, inhibition of a small subset of therapeutically relevant PTKs (multitargeting), in addition to ALK, can improve the efficacy of an oncology drug, especially for solid tumors which are often heterogeneous and have complicated tumor biology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother group of tyrosine kinases evolutionary and structurally related to ALK is, Ret, Ros, Axl, and kinases that are members of Trk family (Trk A, B and C).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that has a role in transducing growth and differentiation signals in tissues derived from the neural crest and is required for normal development of the sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems and the kidney. Gain of function mutations of Ret are associated with the development of several types of human cancers, including medullar thyroid carcinoma and multiple endocrine neoplasias type II and III (or MEN2A and MEN2B). RET mutations have been also identified in a small percentage of pheochromocytomas. Chromosomal rearrangements involving the RET gene are one of the most common causes of a sporadic form of thyroid cancer called papillary thyroid carcinoma (also known as RET/PTC). There is a compelling experimental evidence that thyroid cell transformation to PTC is driven by hyperactivated Ret (Santoro, 2004]. Kinase inhibitors with activity against RET are currently in preclinical or clinical development for these types of cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nROS or ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that has been found to be constitutively activated in a subset of glioblastomas as a result of genomic translocations (Charest, 2003; Charest, 2006) and may represent an emerging therapeutic target in this highly malignant and deadly brain tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAXL is a unique tyrosine kinase receptor, implicated in the inhibition of apoptosis as well as promoting neovascularization, and it is emerging as a viable therapeutic target in a number of malignancies, both solid and hematologic (Holland, 2005). In particular, it is a chronic myelogenous leukemia-associated oncogene (O'Bryan, 1991; Jannsen, 1991) and is also associated with colon, prostate cancer and melanoma (Van Ginkel, 2004; Sainaghi, 2005). Overexpression of Axl in myeloid cells has been shown to be involved in Type II diabetes (Augustine, 1999). Modulation of Axl activity by small-molecule kinase inhibitors may have utility in therapy of the disease states mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTrkA is a receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to a subfamily of tyrosine kinases that also includes TrkB, and TrkC. TrkB and TrkC are structurally closely related to TrkA, but respond to different ligands in the neurotrophin (NT) family. Nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling through TrkA has been well characterized and is similar to signal transduction mechanisms of other tyrosine kinase receptors. As outlined in more detail below, TrkA is a well validated or a potential drug target in a variety of malignancies as well as in neuropathic pain and certain inflammatory diseases. The roles of the two other members of the neurothropin receptor TK family, TrkB and TrkC, in disease states has received less attention, however the emerging evidence implicates both of them in several types of neoplasias.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTrkA gene was originally described as a chimeric oncogene in colon cancer (Martin-Zanca, 1986] and its activating genomic translocations are common in papillary thyroid carcinomas (Bongarzone, 1989; Pierotti, 2006) and occur in breast cancer as well (Brzezianska, 2007). Hyperactivating deletion or fusion mutations of TrkA and TrkC were also identified in some acute myeloid leukemias as well as solid tumors (Reuther, 2000; Eguchi, 2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverexpression of TrkA in malignant versus normal tissues and association with poor prognosis was shown in prostate, pancreatic cancers, melanomas, and mesotheliomas (Festuccia, 2007; Myknyoczki, 1999; Florenes, 2004; Davidson, 2004). TrkA is overexpressed in the majority of prostate carcinomas, and is further increased in androgen-independent tumors (Papatsoris, 2007). In prostatic carcinomas, an autocrine loop involving NGF and TrkA is responsible for tumor progression (Djakiew, 1993). An autocrine NGF/TrkA loop and mitogenic role of NGF has been demonstrated in breast cancer cells as well (Chiarenza, 20011; Dolle, 2003). It has also been shown that NGF signaling has angiogenesis-promoting effect (Cantarella, 2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTrkB, sometimes in conjunction with its ligand BDNF, is often overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, ranging from neuroblastomas to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, in which it may allow tumor expansion and contribute to resistance to anti-tumor agents. TrkB acts as a potent suppressor of anoikis (detachment-induced apoptosis), which is associated with the acquisition of an aggressive tumorigenic and metastatic phenotype in vivo (Desmet, 2006; Douma, 2004). In summary, Trk family members have been implicated as oncogenes in a number of neoplasms including prostate, thyroid, pancreatic, colon, breast, ovarian cancers, melanomas and some leukemias. For prostate cancer and thyroid carcinomas, TrkA is especially well validated as a drug target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStrong and diverse experimental evidence suggests that nerve growth factor (NGF), signaling through TrkA pathway, is a mediator of some persistent pain states, including neuropathic and inflammatory pain (Pezet, 2006; Hefti, 2006; Bennet, 2001). Function-neutralizing anti-NGF and anti-TrkA antibodies demonstrated therapeutic effect in models of inflammatory, neuropathic, skeletal and cancer pain (Ugolini, 2007; Koewler, 2007; Sevcik, 2005). In such disease states as prostate cancer with metastatic bone pain and pancreatic cancer with perineural invasion, cancer progression, pain and TrkA signaling has been shown to be all positively correlated (Dang, 2006; Halvorson, 2005). Inhibition of the NGF/TrkA pathway appears to be very well validated for treatment of chronic pain of different natures: (i) inflammatory pain; (ii) neuropathic pain and (iii) cancer pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is noteworthy that in the skin, TrkA receptor mediates the ability of NGF to stimulate keratinocytes proliferation and inhibit keratinocytes apoptosis. NGF is produced by keratinocytes to stimulate their cell proliferation with an autocrine loop and melanocyte proliferation with a paracrine pathway (Di Marco, 1993; Pincelli, 2000). NGF/TrkA signaling also modulates inflammation (Frossard, 2004) and proliferation of terminal cutaneous nerves (Raychaudhury, 2004), components of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Murine models for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis have been established and K252a and AG879, both potent non-clinical TrkA inhibitors, were demonstrated to have therapeutic effect [Raychaudhury, 2004; Takano, 2007] in the models. This data indicates that TrkA is a potential drug target in skin disorders characterized by keratinocytes hyperproliferation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKelly cell lines are a human neuroblastoma cell line in which a constitutively active mutant (F1174L) ALK promotes cell growth. Various gain-of-function mutations occur in approximately in 8% of primary neuroblastomas and are believed to have a transforming influence. Neuroblastoma most often begins during early childhood, usually in children younger than 5 years. Neuroblastoma often begins in the nerve tissue of the adrenal glands. By the time neuroblastoma is diagnosed, the cancer has usually metastasized (spread), most often to the lymph nodes, bones, bone marrow, liver, and skin. Neuroblastoma, accounts for approximately 15% of all deaths due to childhood cancer. High-risk neuroblastomas are rapidly progressive; even with intensive myeloablative chemotherapy, relapse is common and almost uniformly fatal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, tyrosine kinases are now widely recognized as attractive proteins for molecularly targeted cancer therapy. Blocking the ALK activity (e.g., inhibition of oncogenic ALK fusion proteins (NPM-ALK or others), gain-of-function ALK mutations (F1174L or others), or aberrant overexpression of wild-type or mutant ALK) represents a rational, targeted approach to therapy of various diseases. As there are several tyrosine kinases that are evolutionary and structurally related to ALK, such as Ret, Ros, Axl, and members of Trk family, there is an opportunity to either identify a multitargeted kinase inhibitor with a potential utility in other types of malignancies not targeted by selective ALK inhibition, or to fine-tune the inhibition selectivity towards a particular kinase of interest by lead optimization.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nProvided herein are selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors, compositions that comprise the compounds, and methods of using the compounds for the treatment or prevention of diseases or conditions that are characterized by ALK activity or expression in mammals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProvided herein are selective inhibitors of tyrosine kinases evolutionary and structurally related to ALK, such as Ros, and members of Trk family (Trk A, B and C) and are useful for the treatment or prevention of diseases or conditions characterized by aberrant ALK, ROS, and Trk family of tyrosine kinase activity or expression in mammals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds provided herein are inhibitors of ALK, ROS, and Trk family of tyrosine kinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, this invention is directed to Compound (45) or its stereoisomer, tautomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, or any combination thereof represented by the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, this invention is directed to a compound represented by the structure of formula (IX) or its stereoisomer, tautomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, or any combination thereof:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein R\na \nis optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl;\n\n\nR\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare each independently hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen, cyano, lower alkylamino or di-lower alkylamino; and\n\n\nR\n5 \nis hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen, cyano, lower alkylamino or di-lower alkylamino.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the compounds of this invention are inhibitors of ALK, ROS, and members of Trk family (Trk A, B and C).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, this invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound of this invention or its stereoisomer, tautomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, or any combination thereof and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, excipients or carriers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, this invention is directed to a method of modulating a tyrosine kinase activity comprising the step of contacting the tyrosine kinase with an amount of a compound of this invention effective to modulate the tyrosine kinase activity.

An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is designated (R) or (S) according to the rules of Cahn and Prelog (Cahn et al., 1966\n, Angew. Chem. \n78:413-447\n, Angew. Chem\n., Int. Ed. Engl. 5:385-414 (errata: \nAngew. Chem\n., Int. Ed. Engl. 5:511); Prelog and Helmchen, 1982\n, Angew. Chem. \n94:614-631\n, Angew. Chem. Internat. Ed. Eng. \n21:567-583; Mata and Lobo, 1993\n, Tetrahedron\n: Asymmetry 4:657-668) or can be characterized by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and is designated dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+)- or (−)-isomers, respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of enantiomers is called a “racemic mixture”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the compounds provided herein may possess one or more asymmetric centers; such compounds can therefore be produced as the individual (R)- or (S)-enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. Unless indicated otherwise, for example by designation of stereochemistry at any position of a formula, the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. Methods for determination of stereochemistry and separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art.

The ability to utilize lower dosages of a therapy and/or to administer said therapy less frequently reduces the toxicity associated with the administration of said therapy to a subject without reducing the efficacy of said therapy in the prevention, management or treatment of a disorder. In addition, a synergistic effect can result in improved efficacy of agents in the prevention, management or treatment of a disorder. Finally, a synergistic effect of a combination of therapies may avoid or reduce adverse or unwanted side effects associated with the use of either therapy alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “therapeutic agent” and “therapeutic agents” refer to any agent(s) which can be used in the treatment, management, or amelioration of a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof. In certain embodiments, the term “therapeutic agent” refers to a compound provided herein. In certain other embodiments, the term “therapeutic agent” does not refer to a compound provided herein. In certain embodiments, a therapeutic agent is an agent which is known to be useful for, or has been or is currently being used for the treatment, management, prevention, or amelioration a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof.

The composition or single unit dosage form, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLactose-free compositions provided herein can comprise excipients that are well known in the art and are listed, for example, in the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) SP (XXI)/NF (XVI). In one embodiment, lactose-free compositions comprise an active ingredient, a binder/filler, and a lubricant in pharmaceutically compatible and pharmaceutically acceptable amounts. Exemplary lactose-free dosage forms comprise an active ingredient, microcrystalline cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, and magnesium stearate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProvided herein are anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising active ingredients, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, the addition of water (e.g., 5%) is widely accepted in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. See, e.g., Jens T. Carstensen, Drug Stability: Principles & Practice, 2d. Ed., Marcel Dekker, NY, N.Y., 1995, pp. 379-80. In effect, water and heat accelerate the decomposition of some compounds. Thus, the effect of water on a formulation can be of great significance since moisture and/or humidity are commonly encountered during manufacture, handling, packaging, storage, shipment, and use of formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms provided herein can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise lactose and at least one active ingredient that comprises a primary or secondary amine are in certain embodiments anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and/or storage is expected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn anhydrous pharmaceutical composition should be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions are in certain embodiments packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastics, unit dose containers (e.g., vials), blister packs, and strip packs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProvided herein are pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise one or more compounds that reduce the rate by which an active ingredient will decompose. Such compounds, which are referred to herein as “stabilizers,” include, but are not limited to, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, pH buffers, or salt buffers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions and single unit dosage forms can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Such compositions and dosage forms will contain a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of a prophylactic or therapeutic agent in certain embodiments in purified form, together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions or single unit dosage forms are sterile and in suitable form for administration to a subject, in certain embodiments an animal subject, such as a mammalian subject, particularly a human subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmaceutical composition provided herein is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include, but are not limited to, parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, oral, buccal, sublingual, inhalation, intranasal, transdermal, topical, transmucosal, intra-tumoral, intra-synovial and rectal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, oral, intranasal or topical administration to human beings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures for subcutaneous administration to human beings. In one embodiment, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocamne to ease pain at the site of the injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of dosage forms include, but are not limited to: tablets; caplets; capsules, such as soft elastic gelatin capsules; cachets; troches; lozenges; dispersions; suppositories; ointments; cataplasms (poultices); pastes; powders; dressings; creams; plasters; solutions; patches; aerosols (e.g., nasal sprays or inhalers); gels; liquid dosage forms suitable for oral or mucosal administration to a patient, including suspensions (e.g., aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspensions, oil-in-water emulsions, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsions), solutions, and elixirs; liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient; and sterile solids (e.g., crystalline or amorphous solids) that can be reconstituted to provide liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe composition, shape, and type of dosage forms provided herein will typically vary depending on their use. For example, a dosage form used in the acute treatment of inflammation or a related disorder may contain larger amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than a dosage form used in the chronic treatment of the same disease. Also, the therapeutically effective dosage form may vary among different types of cancer. Similarly, a parenteral dosage form may contain smaller amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than an oral dosage form used to treat the same disease or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese and other ways in which specific dosage forms provided herein will vary from one another will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1990).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ingredients of compositions provided herein are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical dosage forms comprise a compound provided herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or hydrate thereof lie within the range of from about 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg per day. Particular dosage forms have about 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100, 200, 250, 500 or 1000 mg of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOral Dosage Forms\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions provided herein that are suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as, but are not limited to, tablets (e.g., chewable tablets), caplets, capsules, and liquids (e.g., flavored syrups). Such dosage forms contain predetermined amounts of active ingredients, and may be prepared by methods of pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art. See generally, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1990).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the oral dosage forms are solid and prepared under anhydrous conditions with anhydrous ingredients, as described in detail in the sections above. However, the scope extends beyond anhydrous, solid oral dosage forms. As such, further forms are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical oral dosage forms provided herein are prepared by combining the active ingredient(s) in an intimate admixture with at least one excipient according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. Excipients can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. For example, excipients suitable for use in oral liquid or aerosol dosage forms include, but are not limited to, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, and coloring agents. Examples of excipients suitable for use in solid oral dosage forms (e.g., powders, tablets, capsules, and caplets) include, but are not limited to, starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid excipients are employed. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy. In general, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredients with liquid carriers, finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then shaping the product into the desired presentation if necessary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredients in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of excipients that can be used in oral dosage forms include, but are not limited to, binders, fillers, disintegrants, and lubricants. Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, (e.g., Nos. 2208, 2906, 2910), microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of fillers suitable for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof. The binder or filler in pharmaceutical compositions provided herein is typically present in from about 50 to about 99 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable forms of microcrystalline cellulose include, but are not limited to, the materials sold as AVICEL-PH-101, AVICEL-PH-103 AVICEL RC-581, AVICEL-PH-105 (available from FMC Corporation, American Viscose Division, Avicel Sales, Marcus Hook, Pa.), and mixtures thereof. An specific binder is a mixture of microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sold as AVICEL RC-581. Suitable anhydrous or low moisture excipients or additives include AVICEL-PH-103™ and \nStarch\n 1500 LM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisintegrants are used in the compositions to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Tablets that contain too much disintegrant may disintegrate in storage, while those that contain too little may not disintegrate at a desired rate or under the desired conditions. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too much nor too little to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredients should be used to form solid oral dosage forms provided herein. The amount of disintegrant used varies based upon the type of formulation, and is readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. Typical pharmaceutical compositions comprise from about 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, specifically from about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisintegrants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, pre-gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLubricants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethyl laureate, agar, and mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel (AEROSIL 200, manufactured by W.R. Grace Co. of Baltimore, Md.), a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica (marketed by Degussa Co. of Plano, Tex.), CAB-O-SIL (a pyrogenic silicon dioxide product sold by Cabot Co. of Boston, Mass.), and mixtures thereof. If used at all, lubricants are typically used in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms into which they are incorporated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControlled Release Dosage Forms\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActive ingredients such as the compounds provided herein can be administered by controlled release means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; and 4,008,719, 5,674,533, 5,059,595, 5,591,767, 5,120,548, 5,073,543, 5,639,476; 5,354,556, and 5,733,566, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled-release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active ingredients. Thus provided are single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled-release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll controlled-release-pharmaceutical products have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled counterparts. Ideally, the use of an optimally designed controlled-release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled-release formulations include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled-release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the drug, and can thus affect the occurrence of side (e.g., adverse) effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost controlled-release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of drug (active ingredient) that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of other amounts of drug to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of drug in the body, the drug must be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions including, but not limited to, pH, temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParenteral Dosage Forms\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParenteral dosage forms can be administered to patients by various routes including, but not limited to, subcutaneous, intravenous (including bolus injection), intramuscular, and intraarterial. Because their administration typically bypasses patients' natural defenses against contaminants, parenteral dosage forms are in certain embodiments sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to administration to a patient. Examples of parenteral dosage forms include, but are not limited to, solutions ready for injection, dry products ready to be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for injection, suspensions ready for injection, and emulsions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds that increase the solubility of one or more of the active ingredients disclosed herein can also be incorporated into the parenteral dosage forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransdermal, Topical & Mucosal Dosage Forms\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransdermal, topical, and mucosal dosage forms provided herein include, but are not limited to, ophthalmic solutions, sprays, aerosols, creams, lotions, ointments, gels, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, or other forms known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th and 18th eds., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1980 & 1990); and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, 4th ed., Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia (1985). Dosage forms suitable for treating mucosal tissues within the oral cavity can be formulated as mouthwashes or as oral gels. Further, transdermal dosage forms include “reservoir type” or “matrix type” patches, which can be applied to the skin and worn for a specific period of time to permit the penetration of a desired amount of active ingredients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable excipients (e.g., carriers and diluents) and other materials that can be used to provide transdermal, topical, and mucosal dosage forms provided herein are well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts, and depend on the particular tissue to which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form will be applied. With that fact in mind, typical excipients include, but are not limited to, water, acetone, ethanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, mineral oil, and mixtures thereof to form lotions, tinctures, creams, emulsions, gels or ointments, which are non-toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable. Moisturizers or humectants can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms if desired. Examples of such additional ingredients are well known in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th and 18th eds., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1980 & 1990).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the specific tissue to be treated, additional components may be used prior to, in conjunction with, or subsequent to treatment with active ingredients provided herein. For example, penetration enhancers can be used to assist in delivering the active ingredients to the tissue. Suitable penetration enhancers include, but are not limited to: acetone; various alcohols such as ethanol, oleyl, and tetrahydrofuryl; alkyl sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide; dimethyl acetamide; dimethyl formamide; polyethylene glycol; pyrrolidones such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; Kollidon grades (Povidone, Polyvidone); urea; and various water-soluble or insoluble sugar esters such as Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) and Span 60 (sorbitan monostearate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pH of a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form, or of the tissue to which the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is applied, may also be adjusted to improve delivery of one or more active ingredients. Similarly, the polarity of a solvent carrier, its ionic strength, or tonicity can be adjusted to improve delivery. Compounds such as stearates can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms to advantageously alter the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of one or more active ingredients so as to improve delivery. In this regard, stearates can serve as a lipid vehicle for the formulation, as an emulsifying agent or surfactant, and as a delivery-enhancing or penetration-enhancing agent. Different salts, hydrates or solvates of the active ingredients can be used to further adjust the properties of the resulting composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage & Frequency of Administration\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the compound or composition which will be effective in the prevention, treatment, management, or amelioration of a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof will vary with the nature and severity of the disease or condition, and the route by which the active ingredient is administered. The frequency and dosage will also vary according to factors specific for each patient depending on the specific therapy (e.g., therapeutic or prophylactic agents) administered, the severity of the disorder, disease, or condition, the route of administration, as well as age, body, weight, response, and the past medical history of the patient. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary doses of a compound include milligram or microgram amounts of the active peptide per kilogram of subject or sample weight (e.g., about 1 microgram per kilogram to about 500 milligrams per kilogram, about 100 micrograms per kilogram to about 5 milligrams per kilogram, or about 1 microgram per kilogram to about 50 micrograms per kilogram). In one embodiment, the recommended daily dose range of a compound provided herein for the conditions described herein lie within the range of from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg per day, given as a single once-a-day dose in certain embodiments as divided doses throughout a day. It may be necessary to use dosages of the active ingredient outside the ranges disclosed herein in some cases, as will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, it is noted that the clinician or treating physician will know how and when to interrupt, adjust, or terminate therapy in conjunction with individual patient response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifferent therapeutically effective amounts may be applicable for different diseases and conditions, as will be readily known by those of ordinary skill in the art. Similarly, amounts sufficient to prevent, manage, treat or ameliorate such disorders, but insufficient to cause, or sufficient to reduce, adverse effects associated with the compounds provided herein are also encompassed by the above described dosage amounts and dose frequency schedules. Further, when a patient is administered multiple dosages of a compound provided herein, not all of the dosages need be the same. For example, the dosage administered to the patient may be increased to improve the prophylactic or therapeutic effect of the compound or it may be decreased to reduce one or more side effects that a particular patient is experiencing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, administration of the same compound provided herein may be repeated and the administrations may be separated by at least 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, 30 days, 45 days, 2 months, 75 days, 3 months, or 6 months. In other embodiments, administration of the same prophylactic or therapeutic agent may be repeated and the administration may be separated by at least at least 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, 30 days, 45 days, 2 months, 75 days, 3 months, or 6 months.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds according to formula (I) can be prepared according to any method apparent to those skilled in the art. Provided below are exemplary methods for their preparation.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein Z\n1 \nis Cl or I.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein AR is selected from optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis scheme was described in \nJ. Med. Chem. \n35 (1992), 280-285. The racemic compounds can be resolved by any of the resolution methods known in the art, including but not limited to chiral chromatography (e.g.: chromatography on a chiral support column), formation of diastereomeric compounds, either ionic, or covalent, such as chiral tartrate salts\n\n\n \n \n \n \nor salts with any feasible chiral acid, carboxylic, or sulfonic. As an example of covalent compounds the corresponding diastereomeric amides, such as chiral mandelamides, formed by standard non-racemizing amide coupling reactions, followed by separation either by chromatography, or fractional crystallization.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein Y\n2 \nis selected from hydrogen, bromo or iodo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesis of the chiral and/or racemic amines is according to the above general scheme and is a modification of the approach described in: Wagner, Jared M.; McElhinny, Charles J.; Lewin, Anita H.; Carroll, F. Ivy. \nTetrahedron: Asymmetry \n(2003), 14(15), 2119-2125.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are presented in order to more fully illustrate the preferred embodiments of the invention.

An equal volume of RPMI (no FBS) containing drug solution (0.1%) was added. Concentrations ranging from 10\n−10 \nto 10\n−5 \nM were evaluated at half-log intervals in triplicate. The cells were allowed to proliferate for 3 days at the end of which cell viability was determined using WST-1 (Roche) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting absorbance values were represented as a percentage of untreated control and fit using a four parameter logistic model in Sigma Plot© (Systat Software) to determine IC\n50 \nvalues.

Materials and Reagents\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman, monkey, dog, rat, and mouse liver microsomes were purchased from Xenotech, LLC. Solution ‘A’ and ‘B’ for NADPH regenerating system (NRS) solution were obtained from BD Biosciences (Waltham, Mass.). Hepatocyte incubation media and supplemented DMEM with and without Percoll were purchased from Xenotech. Verapamil and other chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\n\n\n \n2. Phase I Microsome Reactions\n\n\n \n \n \nTest compound stock solutions were prepared in 50% acetonitrile/50% water at 50 μM. The stock solutions were added in incubation mixtures to obtain the final drug concentration of 0.5 μM, containing 0.5% acetonitrile. Verapamil was used as a positive control. Human, monkey, dog, rat, mouse microsomes were all utilized at a final concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. Duplicate wells were used for each time point (0, 5, 10, 30 and 60 minutes). Incubation was conducted at 37° C. in a shaking water bath. The final volume for each reaction was 200 μl, composed of: 66 μl of 0.2 M KPO\n4 \nbuffer, (pH 7.4); 72 μl of H\n2\nO, 10 μl of 20 mg/ml microsome stock; 2 μl of compound stock solution, and 50 μl of NRS solution. The NRS solution consisted of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADP\n+\n, MgCl\n2\n, and glucose 6-phosphate, and was prepared as described in manufacturer's instructions. At the end of incubation, the reaction was quenched by mixing with same volume of cold acetonitrile containing internal standard ((R)-2-(4-((3-(2,4-dimethylphenoxy)-2-hydroxypropyl)amino)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridin-3-yl)-6-(1-(2-(methylsulfonyl)ethyl)piperidin-4-yl)-6,7-dihydroimidazo[4,5-f]isoindol-5(3H)-one, 200 nM). Samples were then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4° C. to precipitate protein. Approximately 150 μl of supernantant was subsequently transferred to a new sample block for LC/MS/MS analysis.\n\n\n \n3. LC-MS/MS Analysis:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe analysis of the compounds under investigation was performed using LC-MS/MS system consisting of Agilent 1100 HPLC with an MDS/Sciex 4000 Q-Trap™ mass spectrometer. The separation was achieved using a C18 analytical column (Alltima™, 2.1×100 mm, 3 μm) protected by a C18 guard column (SecurityGuard™ 4.0×2.0 mm ID, Phenomenex). Mobile phase consisted of channel A (95% acetonitrile+5% water+0.1% formic acid) and channel B (95% water+5% acetonitrile+0.1% formic acid) and was delivered at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The volume ratio of acetonitrile and water was optimized for each of the analytes. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scans were made with curtain gas at 30, collision gas at high, nebulizer gas at 30, auxiliary gas at 40, and source temperature at 500° C. Molecular ions were formed using an ion spray voltage of 5500 V (positive mode) and −4500 V (negative mode). Declustering potential, entrance potential, collision energy, product ion mass, and cell exit potential were optimized for each compound.

Caco-2 Cell Permeation Study\n\n\n \n \n \nCaco-2 cells were routinely maintained in T-75 flasks at 37° C. in an atmosphere of 7% CO\n2 \nin DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 20 ug/ml gentamicin, and 2 ug/ml Amphotericin B. Confluent cell monolayers were subcultured weekly by treatment with 0.25% trypsin, counted using a haemocytometer and diluted to 2×10\n6 \ncells and grown in a new T75 flask. For transport studies, cells were seeded onto a 24-well, high density PET transwell membrane inserts, (1.0 μm pore size, 0.31 cm\n2 \nsurface area) at a density of 40,000 cells/cm\n2\n. Caco-2 monolayers were fed with fresh medium 24 h after seeding and then 3 times per week. Caco-2 monolayers were cultured for 21-28 days before use. Prior to all experiments, each monolayer was washed twice with the transport buffer followed by the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) value measurement to ensure the integrity of the monolayers. Lucifer yellow (0.2 mg/ml) and atenolol (50 μM) were co-treated with test compound/positive control to ensure the integrity of monolayers. The positive control compounds (propranolol, 10 μM) were used to assess the suitability of a batch of cells. The apical buffer (Buffer A) consisted of Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, 10 mM D-glucose monohydrate, 20 mM MES Biological Buffer, 1 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1 mM MgCl\n2 \n(pH 6.5). The basolateral buffer (Buffer B) consisted of Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, 10 mM D-glucose monohydrate, 20 mM HEPES Biological Buffer, 1 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1 mM MgCl\n2 \n(pH 7.4). Permeability experiments were performed in the apical-to basolateral (A to B) and the basolateral-to-apical (B to A) directions in triplicate at 37° C. with shaking (100 rpm) for 2 h. Compounds were tested at 10 μM in Buffer A (HBSS-Mes, pH 6.5) for A to B permeability study, and Buffer B (HBSS-Hepes, pH 7.4) for B to A permeability study. Samples for analysis were taken from the basolateral side and mixed with the same volume of ice-cold acetonitrile. The concentrations of the test compounds were analyzed by the following LC/MS/MS method.\n\n\n \n2.

Compound 31 on KELLY Cells\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n \n \n \nRecently several activating ALK mutations have been characterized in neuroblastoma. [George et al. Activating mutations in ALK provide a therapeutic target in neuroblastoma. Nature 455:975, 2008.] F1174L, the most common mutation found in primary tumors is also present in the neuroblastoma cell line KELLY (ATCC)[Janoueix-Lerosey et al. Molecular pathogenesis of peripheral neuroblastic tumors. Oncogene 29:1566, 2010.] When ALK expression is abrogated in KELLY cells using siRNA methods their growth rate is significantly reduced. Also the addition of F1174L-ALK to the mouse B-cell line BaF3 renders them IL-3 independent indicating the transformative capacity of this mutation. When taken together these data suggest KELLY cell growth is ALK dependent. To test the ligands ability to inhibit ALK mediated growth in KELLY cells we performed a 3 day growth study in the presence of increasing concentrations of ligand.\n\n\n \nMethods\n\n\n \n \n \nKELLY cells in log-phase growth were plated using full growth media (RPMI, 10% FBS) in 96-well plates at a density of 3,000 cells per well. An equal volume of RPMI (no FBS) with double the indicated concentration of ligand was also added. Each concentration was performed in triplicate. The cells were allowed to proliferate for 3 days at the end of which cell viability was determined using WST-1 reagent (Roche). The resulting absorbance values were represented as a percentage of untreated control and fit using Sigma-Plot to determine IC\n50 \nvalues.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound\n 1 demonstrated increased potency over 31 in its ability to inhibit ALK mediated KELLY growth. The IC\n50 \nfor Compound 31 (trifluoro-amphetamine) was determined to be 3.15 μM whereas the IC\n50 \nfor Compound 1 (tetrafluoro-amphetamine) 564 nM (\nFIG. 1\n).\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nBioavailability of \nCompound\n 1\n\n\nStudy Design\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) of the University of Tennessee approved the study. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing approximately 250 g, were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, Ind., USA). Animals (n=5 per group) were assigned to receive test compound. Intravenous (I.V.) and oral (P.O.) doses were administered at the following \ndose levels\n 10 mg/kg. Eighteen h before dosing, the animals were catheterized in the right jugular vein. The animals were provided food (Harlan Teklad 22/5 rodent diet) and water ad libitum. Body weights were determined at the time of catheter placement.\n\n\n \nDosing Vehicles\n\n\n \n \n \nDoses were administered in a volume of 1 ml/kg. l.v. Doses were administered via the jugular catheter and the catheter was flushed with 3× the dosing volume of heparinized saline. P.o. Doses were administered via gavage. For racemic PF02341066, the dosing vehicle consisted of a 25:75 mixture of dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) and polyethylene glycol 300 (peg 300). For \nCompound\n 1 the dosing vehicle consisted of a 10:90 mixture of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and polyethylene glycol 300 (peg 300).\n\n\n \nBlood Sampling\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo hundred fifty (250) μL blood samples were drawn from the jugular vein at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480, 720, 1440, and 2880 min following the I.V. dose and 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 480, 720, 1440, and 2880 min following the P.O. dose. Whole blood samples were collected in sodium heparinized tubes and placed on ice until plasma was separated by centrifugation at 1800 g for 15 min. Plasma was stored at −80° C. until analysis.\n\n\n \nAnalytical Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nNon-GLP study sample analysis was performed for rat plasma samples collected below. The study samples were analyzed using a non validated LC-MS/MS testing method.\n\n\n \nPharmacokinetic Data Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe plasma concentration-time data were analyzed by non-compartmental methods using WinNonlin (Phoenix Version 6.0, Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, Calif., USA). The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC) was calculated by the trapezoidal rule with extrapolation to time infinity. The terminal half-life (T\n1/2\n) was calculated as 0.693λ\nz\n \n−1\n, where λ\nz \nwas the terminal phase rate constant. The plasma clearance (CL) was calculated as CL=dose\ni.v\n. AUC\ni.v.\n \n−1\n, where dose\ni.v. \nand AUC\ni.v. \nare the i.v. dose and corresponding area under the curve from \ntime\n 0 to infinity, respectively. The maximal plasma concentration (C\nmax\n) and time at which it occurred (T\nmax\n) for the p.o. doses were determined by visual inspection of the concentration-time profiles. The apparent volume of distribution at equilibrium (V\nss\n) was calculated using: V\nss\n=dose*AUMC\n0→∞\n(AUC\n0→∞\n)\n−2 \nwhere AUMC\n0→∞\n is the area under the first moment of the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity. The mean residence time (MRT) was calculated using: MRT=AUMC\n0→∞\n(AUC\n0→∞\n)\n−1 \nOral bioavailability (F) for each dose was calculated using: F=AUC\np.o \ndose\ni.v.\n(AUC\ni.v.\ndose\np.o.\n)\n−1 \nwhere dose\np.o.\n, dose\ni.v.\n, AUC\ni.v.\nand AUC\np.o.\nare the mean oral dose, mean i.v. dose, and the corresponding mean areas under the curve from \ntime\n 0 to 1440 min, respectively.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-compartmental analysis of 10 mg/kg I.V. doses of racemic \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPF02341066 and \nCompound\n 1 in rats.

The positive control inhibitor E-4031 caused a mean 97.8% inhibition of the hERG current at 0.5 μM, confirming the sensitivity of the assay system to hERG inhibition.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIndividual\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMean %\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nConc.\n\n\nhERG\n\n\nStandard\n\n\n \n\n\nPoints (%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound ID\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\nInhibition\n\n\nDeviation\n\n\nn\n\n\nInhibition)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCompound\n 3\n\n\n3.175\n\n\n 0.3\n\n\n12.2\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n2\n\n\n13.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n 3\n\n\n49.4\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n2\n\n\n49.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n49.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n73.3\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n2\n\n\n75.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n70.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30*\n\n\n84.4\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n2\n\n\n87.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n81.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCompound\n 1\n\n\n6.254\n\n\n 0.3\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n2\n\n\n5.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n 3\n\n\n39.9\n\n\n5.2\n\n\n2\n\n\n43.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n36.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n54.4\n\n\n7.0\n\n\n2\n\n\n59.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n49.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30*\n\n\n66.9\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n2\n\n\n71.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n62.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE4031\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n 0.5\n\n\n97.8\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n3\n\n\n98.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(positive\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n97.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrol)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n98.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*low solubility at this concentration for this compound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nActivities Against ALK Mutants Conferring PF2341066 (Crizotinib) Resistance Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nNPM-ALK was cloned from KARPAS-299 cells and further subcloned into the mammalian expression construct pCR3.I (Invitrogen). An EML4-ALK construct was synthesized (Genscript) using the reference sequence (NM\n—\n019063.3, \ntranscript variant\n 1 E13;A20) and subcloned into pCR3.1. Site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange, Qiagen) was performed on each construct at a single nucleotide whereby upon translation C1156→Y, or F1174→L, or L1196→M, or R1275→Q. All of these mutants except R1275Q have been found in tumor biopsies of patients refractory to PF2341066 (crizotinib) therapy (Sakamoto H, Tsukaguchi T, Hiroshima S, Kodama T, Kobayashi T, Fukami T A, Oikawa N, Tsukuda T, Ishii N, Aoki Y CH5424802, a selective ALK inhibitor capable of blocking the resistant gatekeeper mutant. \nCancer Cell \n(2011) 19:679-90): FLT3-ITD was cloned from the MRV411 cell line and further subcloned into pCR3.1.

An equal volume of RPMI (no FBS) containing drug solution (0.1%) was added. Concentrations ranging from 10\n−10 \nto 10\n−5\nM were evaluated at half-log intervals in triplicate. The cells were allowed to proliferate for 3 days at the end of which cell viability was determined using WST-1 (Roche) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Most ALK translocations are thought to be cytomplasmic and include a normally cytoplasmic N-terminal partner and the intracellular kinase domain of ALK. (\nFIG. 8\n). For PF-02341066, the F1174L resistance requires N-terminal fusion partner in the cellular context as no resistance is seen in cell-free assays (Table 15). By \ncomparison Compound\n 45 demonstrated 10-fold cell free resistance in F1174L mutant which was not reflected in EML4-ALK BaF3 cells and 2-fold L1196M resistance (similar to cellular models) which is an improvement over the 9×L1196M resistance observed for PF-02341066. \nCompound\n 45 had 4-fold R1275Q resistance compared to 2-fold for PF-02341066. Compound 1 (S-isomer) demonstrated nearly identical cell free activities to Compound 45, consistent with small changes to amphetamine ring which is not expected to interact directly with F1174 and R1275.
