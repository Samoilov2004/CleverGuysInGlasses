Diabetes mellitus may be divided into two clinical syndromes, that is, type I diabetes mellitus and type II diabetes mellitus. Type I diabetes mellitus, also known as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), is caused by an autoimmune process which destroys the insulin-producing pancreas beta cells, and requires regular administration of external insulin. Type II diabetes mellitus, also known as noninsul in-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), is caused by the loss of capability of adequately controlling blood glucose level. Type II diabetes mellitus is characterized by people having an insulin secretion defect or insulin resistance, in other words, they have insufficient insulin or cannot effectively use insulin. \n\n\n <3> In diabetes mellitus patients, a glucose level is accumulated within blood and urine, which causes excessive urination, thirst, hunger, fat or protein metabolism-related problems. Such diabetes mellitus may cause life threatening complications (e.g. sight loss, renal failure, and heart disease), and damage to the retina on the eye's inner surface, and increases risk of cataractsand glaucoma. Also, diabetes mellitus is related to a nerve damage of thelegs and feet, which reduces of the capacity to feel pain, and causes serious infections. \n\n\n <4> At present, treatments of diabetes mellitus include insulin, insulin secretagogue, glucose- lowering effectors, a peroxisom prol i ferators-act ivated receptor (PPAR) activators, etc. However, there are problems related to the \n\n KR2011/005268 \n\n\ncurrently available treatments such as hypoglycemia, weight gain, a decrease in reactivity on treatment with the passing of time, gastro-intestinal tract problems, and edema. \n\n\n <5> In order to introduce a novel and more effective treatment onto the market, research aiming at various areas has been conducted. One particular target is GPR119. GPR119 is a G-prote in-coupled receptor (GPCR) which is mainly expressed in the pancreas, small intestine, colon, and adipose tissue. A GPR119-expression profile is a target for treatment of obesity and diabetes mellitus and shows a latent availability of GPR119. It was proven that GPR119 activation stimulates cAMP, thereby inducing secretion of lucose-dependent GLP-1 and insulin (T. Soga et al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communication 326 (2005) 744-751).

The cells were dissolved, and D2-labeled cAMP and crypt ate- labeled anti-cAMP antibody were used to measure cAMP level through a competitive immunoassay. Fluorescence was read by a Flex Station (Molecular Devices). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) occurs between D2 and cryptate when D2 and cryptate come close to each other. FRET is measured as fluorescence ratio (665/620nm) . Non-labeled cAMP within a cell lysate competed with D2-labeled cAMP, against crypt ate- labeled antibody. The reduction of obtained FRET signal corresponds to cAMP level within cells. The compound activity was calculated by a change in FRET signals through DMSO control. The results are noted in Table 2 below. \n\n\n [Table 2] \n\n\n\n\nExam le EC50 (nM) \n\n\n 1 5 \n\n\n 2 30 \n\n\n 3 10 \n\n\n 4 45 \n\n\n 12 21 \n\n\n 13 51 \n\n\n 15 110 \n\n\n 27 27 \n\n\n 28 100 \n\n\n 32 40 \n\n\n 37 3.2 \n\n\n 39 3.2 \n\n\n 40 3.2 \n\n\n 41 30 \n\n\n 44 3.2 \n\n\n 47 23 \n\n\n 49 40 \n\n\n<52i> Example 56:0ral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) \n\n\n <522> Male C57/6J mice (8 to 10 weeks old) were acclimated for at least 7 days.

Description\n\n\n\n\n GROWTH HORMONE CONJUGATES \n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The present invention relates to growth hormone conjugates comprising a bile acid derivative. The conjugates are useful in treatment of growth hormone deficiencies or other treatments where human growth hormone is usually applied. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n Growth hormone (GH) is a polypeptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary in mammals. Dependent on species GH is a protein composed of approximately 190 amino acid residues corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 22 kDa. GH binds to and signals through cell surface receptors, the GH receptors (GHR). GH plays a key role in promoting growth, maintaining normal body composition, anabolism and lipid metabolism. It also has direct effects on intermediate metabolism, such as decreased glucose uptake, increased lipolysis, amino acid uptake and protein synthesis. The hormone also exerts effects on other tissues including adipose tissue, liver, intestine, kidney, skeleton, connective tissue and muscle. Recombinant hGH has been produced and commercially available as, for ex: Genotropin™ (Pharmacia Upjohn), Nutropin™ and Protropin™ (Genentech), \n\n\nHumatrope™ (Eli Lilly), Serostim™ (Serono), Norditropin (Novo Nordisk), Omnitrope \n\n\n(Sandoz), Nutropin Depot (Genentech and Alkermes). Additionally, an analogue with an additional methionine residue at the N-terminal end is also marketed as, fx: Somatonorm™ (Pharmacia Upjohn/Pfizer). \n\n\n GH shares a common topology with the other members of the GH-family of proteins, Prolactin (PRL) and Placental Lactogen (PL). GH is classified as a four-helix bundle protein (Figure 1 ) exhibiting an \"up-up-down-down\" topology with two conserved disulphide linkages. Specifically, wild-type human GH (hGH) is composed of 191 amino acid residues and has four cysteine residues at positions 53, 165, 182 and 189, which stabilizes the three dimensional structure of the protein by forming two intramolecular disulphide bonds connecting C53 with C165 and C182 with C189, respectively (Figure 1 ). The structure of hGH has been experimentally determined by X-ray crystallography in the free form \n\n\n(Chantalet L. et al Protein and Peptide Letters (1995) 3, 333-340) and in complex with its binding protein (the extra cellular domain of the human GHR (hGHR)) (Devos, A. M. ef al. Science (1992) 255, 306-312). These structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and are publicly available (PDB accession codes 1 HGU and 1 HWG, \n\n\nrespectively). Thus, from the published hGH structures residues important for hGH binding to \n\n hGHR can be identified. Furthermore, the dynamic properties of hGH has been studied by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Kasimova M.R. et al. J. Mol. Biol. (2002) 318, 679-695). In combination, the X-ray and NMR data can distinguish regions of hGH which are well structured and well defined from regions which are less structured and dynamic. Less structured and dynamic regions of hGH are expected to be particularly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage and proper stabilization of such regions would lead to improved proteolytic stability. \n\n\n hGH has been subject to extensive mutagenesis in attempts to produce hGH analogues with desired chemical or biological properties. Specifically, cysteine mutants for several purposes have been described. \n\n\n US 2003/0162949 disclose cysteine variants of members of the GH supergene family. A general method is provided for creating site-specific, biologically active conjugates of these proteins. The method involves adding cysteine residues to non-essential regions of the proteins or substituting cysteine residues for non-essential amino acids in the proteins using site-directed mutagenesis and then covalently coupling a cysteine-reactive polymer or other type of cysteine-reactive moiety to the proteins via the added cysteine residue \n\n\n WO 02/055532 describes genetically engineered hGH mutants having at least one non-polypeptide moiety covalently attached, particularly hGH mutants where a introduced cysteine residue was used for pegylation. \n\n\n US 5,951 ,972 describes physiologically active derivatized natural and recombinant mammalian and human proteins and polypeptides wherein at least one-naturally-occurring or incorporated cysteine residue within the protein is derivatized with various substituents. \n\n\n The proteolytic cleavage of hGH has been studied in detail. The long loop composed of residues 128 to 154 has putative cleavage sites for several proteases, such as thrombin, plasmin, collagenase, subtilisin and chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. \n\n\n Accordingly, this part of hGH has been shown to be particularly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage (Lewis, U.J. Ann. Rev. Physiol. (1984) 46, 33-42). Enzymes reported to degrade hGH include thrombin, plasmin, subtilisin, chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases and kallikreins. \n\n\n The degradation of hGH in rat tissue has been investigated (Garcia-Barros et al. J.\n\n\nEndocrinol. Invest. (2000) 23, 748-754). \n\n\n In rat thyroid gland chymotrypsin-like proteases, favouring cleavage at bulky and lipophilic amino acid residues, were found initially to cleave the peptide bond between Y143 and S144 resulting in a two chain molecule, followed by cleavage between Y42 and S43, liberating the N-terminal peptide F1 -Y42. The split loop in the two chain molecule is \n\n processed further by cleavage between F146 and D147 by chymotrypsin-like proteases and further by the action of carboxypeptidases. \n\n\n Several methods to produce hGH analogues stabilized towards proteolytic degradation have been reported. \n\n\n Alam et al., J. Biotech. (1998) 65, 183-190 designed hGH mutants resistant to thrombin and plasmin by specific point mutations. Thrombin cleaves hGH specifically between R134 and T135, and the double mutant R134D, T135P yielded a hGH variant resistant to cleavage by thrombin, and the triple mutant R134D, T135P, K140A resulted in resistance to plasmin. Furthermore, the latter hGH mutant was resistant to proteolysis by human plasma over a period of 7 days. \n\n\n EP 534568 describes hGH mutants stabilized towards proteolytic degradation by mutating R134 to alanine, leucine, threonine, phenylalanine, proline or histidine. \n\n\n WO 2004/022593/Nautilus describes general high through-put directed evolution methods to produce modified cytokines, including GH variants, with increased proteolytic stability. \n\n\n WO 2006/048777/Nautilus specifically describes modified hGH analogues with improved proteolytic stability. The analogues contain one to five mutations at positions 1 -55, 57, 58, 60-63, 67-87, 89-91 , 93, 95-100, 102-128, 131 -132, 135-139, 141 , 142, 144, 148- 182, 184, 185 and 187-191 . Introduction of cysteine residues can potentially lead to the formation of undesired disulfide linked dimers and in WO 2006/048777 the substitution of amino acid residues by cysteine is specifically excluded from the scope; in WO 2006/048777 (p. 65) it is stated: \"The replacement of amino acids by cysteine residues is explicitly avoided since this change would potentially lead to the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds\". \n\n\n There is an obvious need to develop hGH compounds which are resistant to proteolytic degradation. Such stabilized compounds should exhibit increased stability towards proteolytic cleavage while retaining the desired biological properties of hGH. Such GH molecules would have increased stability, slower clearance and/or prolong in vivo half- life. \n\n\n Furthermore protein therapeutics generally needs to be administered intravenously or subcutaneously because they are generally not sufficiently orally available. The low oral bioavailability of proteins is partly due to proteolytic degradation in the gastrointestinal tract. Hence, there is also a need to develop hGH compounds that can be administered orally to treat hGH related disorders. \n\n\n Naturally occurring bile acids are tightly constrained within the enterohepatic loop through the action of a series of transporter proteins (Carey, M. C; Cahalane, M. J. Entero- \n\n hepatic Circulation. In The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology, 2nd ed.; Raven Press: Ltd, New York, 1988; Chapter 33, pp 573-616). This enteric and hepatic uptake mechanisms ensure that about 90 % of bile acids excreted into the intestine is reabsorbed in the ileum and recycled in what is referred to as the enterohepatic circulation, transferring the bile salts from the intestinal system back to the liver and the gallbladder. \n\n\n A growth hormone compound or conjugate that poses properties similar to naturally occurring bile acids may show oral bioavailability as well as pharmacological relevant hepatic levels and a high liver-to-plasma (or -tissue) ratio and is therefore an high attractive compound. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The present invention describes growth hormone conjugates having a bile acid co- valently bond. The bile acid may as described herein be attached to various growth hormone compounds, such as protease stabilized growth hormone variant. \n\n\n The invention in an aspect relates to a growth hormone conjugate which include a bile acid residue linked to a growth hormone compound. Such growth hormone conjugate may be described by formula (I) \n\n\n A-W-B-GH (I) \n\n\n wherein \n\n\n GH represents a growth hormone compound, \n\n\n A represents a bile acid residue, \n\n\n B represents a hydrophilic spacer covalently linked to GH, \n\n\n W is a chemical group linking A and B; \n\n\n and pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In further embodiments of the invention the growth hormone compound (GH) is a human growth hormone (SEQ ID NO 1 ) or a variant thereof, having one or more amino acid substitutions. \n\n\n The invention in further aspects relate to any use of such growth hormone conjugates, such as it's use in methods of treatment of growth hormone deficiency. \n\n\n The invention in a further aspect relates to a method of preparing a growth hormone conjugate which include a bile acid residue linked to a growth hormone compound, wherein said bile acid residue is covalently linked to the growth hormone compound. \n\n DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \n\n\nFigure 1 \n\n\n Structure of hGH bound to two copies of the hGH binding protein (PDB 1 HWG).

The helix definitions refer to hGH in complex with its binding protein (PDB 1 HWG). \n\n\nDEFINITIONS \n\n\n In the present context, the terms \"peptide\" and \"polypeptide\" are used \n\n\ninterchangeably and are intended to indicate the same. The terms \"peptide\" or \"polypeptide\" are intended to indicate a sequence of two or more amino acids joined by peptide bonds, wherein said amino acids may be natural or unnatural. The constituent amino acids may be from the group of the amino acids encoded by the genetic code and they may be natural amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code, as well as synthetic amino acids. Natural amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code are e.g. Hyp (hydroxy- proline), y-carboxyglutamate, Orn (ornithine), phosphoserine, D-alanine and D-glutamine. Synthetic amino acids comprise amino acids manufactured by chemical synthesis, such as D-isomers of the amino acids encoded by the genetic code such as D-alanine and D-leucine, Aad (a-aminoadipic acid), Aib (a-aminoisobutyric acid), Abu (a-aminobutyric acid), Agl (a - amino-glycine), Asu (a-aminosuberic acid), Cha (β-cyclopentyl-alanine), Chg (cyclohexyl glycine), Dab (α,γ-diaminobutyric acid), Dap (α, β -diaminopropanic acid), Hey \n\n\n(homocysteine), Hpr (homoproline), Nle (Norleucine), Phg (phenylglycine), Hph \n\n\n(homophenylalanine), 1 Nal ( -(l -naphthyl-alanine), 2Nal (p-(2-naphthyl-alanine), 2Pal (-(2- pyridyl)-alanine, 3Pal -(3-pyridyl)-alanine), Pip (4-amino-piperidine-4-carboxylic acid), Pra (propargyl-glycine), Pyr (pyroglutamic acid), Gla (γ-carboxy-glutamic acid), Hci \n\n (homocitruline), Nva (norvaline), Tie (iert-butylglycine), β-alanine, 3-aminomethyl benzoic acid and anthranilic acid. \n\n\n The term also encompasses the term \"proteins\", which may consists of one polypeptide chain, or two or more polypeptide chains held together by non-covalent or covalent interactions, such as for instance cysteine disulfide bridges. \n\n\n It is to be understood that the term is also intended to include peptides, which have been derivatized, for instance by attaching moieties such as, but not limited to, PEG, carbohydrates, fatty acids, albumin binders, alkyl chains, lipophilic groups, vitamins, bile acids, or spacers to the side chains or main chain of the peptide in addition to comprising the additional disulfide bonds. The term peptide includes any suitable peptide and may be used synonymously with the terms polypeptide and protein, unless otherwise stated or \n\n\ncontradicted by context, provided that the reader recognize that each type of respective amino acid polymer-containing molecule may be associated with significant differences and thereby form individual embodiments of the present invention (for example, a peptide such as an antibody, which is composed of multiple polypeptide chains, is significantly different from, for example, a single chain antibody, a peptide immunoadhesin, or single chain immunogenic peptide). Therefore, the term peptide herein should generally be understood as referring to any suitable peptide of any suitable size and composition (with respect to the number of amino acids and number of associated chains in a protein molecule). Moreover, peptides described herein may comprise non-naturally occurring and/or non-L amino acid residues, unless otherwise stated or contradicted by context. \n\n\n The term peptide, unless otherwise stated or contradicted by context, (and if discussed as individual embodiments of the term(s) polypeptide and/or protein) also encompasses derivatized peptide molecules. A derivatized peptide molecules is one in which one or more of the amino acid residues of the peptide have been chemically modified (for instance by alkylation, acylation, ester formation, or amide formation) or associated with one or more non-amino acid organic and/or inorganic atomic or molecular substituents (for instance a polyethylene glycol (PEG) group, a lipophilic substituent (which optionally may be linked to the amino acid sequence of the peptide by a spacer residue or group such as β-alanine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), L/D-glutamic acid, succinic acid, and the like), a fluorophore, biotin, a radionuclide, etc.) and may also or alternatively comprise non-essential, non-naturally occurring, and/or non-L amino acid residues, unless otherwise stated or contradicted by context (however, it should again be recognized that such derivatives may, in and of themselves, be considered independent features of the present invention and inclusion of such molecules within the meaning of peptide is done for the sake of \n\n convenience in describing the present invention rather than to imply any sort of equivalence between naked peptides and such derivatives). \n\n\n Non-limiting examples of such amino acid residues include for instance 2-amino- adipic acid, 3-aminoadipic acid, β-alanine, β-aminopropionic acid, 2-aminobutyric acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, 6-aminocaproic acid, 2-aminoheptanoic acid, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, 3-aminoisobutyric acid, 2-aminopimelic acid, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, desmosine, 2,2'-di- aminopimelic acid, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, N-ethylglycine, N-ethylasparagine, hydroxy- lysine, allohydroxylysine, 3-hydroxyproline, 4-hydroxyproline, isodesmosine, alloisoleucine, N-methylglycine, N-methylisoleucine, 6-N-methyllysine, N-methylvaline, norvaline, nor- leucine, ornithine, propargyl-glycine and statine halogenated amino acids. \n\n\n A \"compound\" described in the present invention may be a \"protein\" or \"peptide\" or \"polypeptide\" which may be an \"analogue\" or a \"variant\", which retains desired biological activities similar to wthGH, irrespective to the manner it has been modified. \n\n\n The term \"analogue\" or \"variant\" as used herein when referring to a polypeptide, means a modified version of said peptide wherein one or more amino acid residues of the peptide have been substituted by other amino acid residues and/or wherein one or more amino acid residues have been deleted from the peptide and or wherein one or more amino acid residues have been added to the peptide. Such substitution or addition or deletion of amino acid residues can take place at the N-terminal of the peptide and/or at the C-terminal of the peptide and/or in between N- or C-terminal of the peptide. All amino acids for which the optical isomer is not stated are to be understood to mean the L-isomer. \n\n\n The terms \"disulphide bond\" or \"disulphide bridge\" are used interchangeably and intended to indicate the same. A \"disulphide bond\" or \"disulphide bridge\" in proteins is formed between the thiol groups of cysteine residues. \n\n\n The term \"additional cysteine\" or \"introduced cysteine\" are used interchangeably and are intended to indicate the same. The terms are intended to include a cysteine residue not present in wild type hGH. To minimize structural changes the cysteine residue(s) are usually introduces by substitution of amino acid residue(s), whereby the length of hGH is maintained. Insertion of an additional cys residue may be tolerated in loop sections or at the boarders of the helixes, whereas introduction of cys residues within the helix'es is less attractive. \n\n\n The term \"additional disulphide bond\" or \"introduced disulphide bond\" are used interchangeably and are intended to indicate the same. The terms are intended to include disulphide bonds formed between two cysteine residues of which at least one is not present in wild type hGH. \n\n The term \"single point mutation\" is used herein to indicate a mutation (compared to hGH as defined in SEQ ID NO 1 ). The term \"additional single point mutation\" may be used to specify that a single point mutation is unrelated to any disulphide bridge forming additional cysteine mutations introduced into the growth hormone compound. The term \"additional single cys mutation\" may be used to specify a point mutation which introduces a cysteine residue. Such a mutation may be the \"additional single point mutation\" or an even further mutation in hGH. \n\n\n The term \"conjugate\" as used herein for defining the invention indicates a peptide or polypeptide, wherein one or more amino acid residues of the peptide have been covalently linked to a bile acid residue. The term \"conjugate\" is thus for the present invention used as a term to distinguish bile acid conjugates from alternative derivatives. It is although noticed that other documents use the terms \"conjugate\" and \"derivative\" interchangeably, so when referring to other documents the terms may be use interchangeably. As a verb, the term is intended to indicate the process of bonding a moiety (here a bile acid residue or linker) to a protein or polypeptide. \n\n\n The term \"derivative\" as used herein refers to a peptide or polypeptide, wherein one or more amino acid residues of the peptide have been chemically modified by introduction of a polymer such as PEG, carbohydrate moieties, albumin binders, fatty acids, lipophilic groups, vitamins or spacers to the side chains or main chain of the growth hormone compound. The chemical modifications may also be transient in nature, i.e. they may readily be removed in vivo. The chemical modifications can be post-translationally introduced, for instance by the cell itself or by chemical modifications performed on the peptide after expression. \n\n\n In the present context, the words \"human growth hormone (hGH)', \"hGH wt\" and \"wild type hGH (wthGH)\" are used interchangeably and refer both to a protein with an amino acid sequence as SEQ ID No.1. \n\n\n The term \"identity\" as known in the art, refers to a relationship between the sequences of two or more peptides, as determined by comparing the sequences. In the art, \"identity\" also means the degree of sequence relatedness between peptides, as determined by the number of matches between strings of two or more amino acid residues. \"Identity\" measures the percent of identical matches between two or more sequences with gap alignments (if any) addressed by a particular mathematical model or computer program (i.e., \"algorithms\"). Identity of related peptides can be readily calculated by known methods. Such methods include, but are not limited to, those described in Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A. M., ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 1988; Biocomputing: Informatics and \n\n Genome Projects, Smith, D. W., ed., Academic Press, New York, 1993; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part 1 , Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds., Humana Press, New Jersey, 1994; Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic Press, 1987; \n\n\nSequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M. Stockton Press, New York, 1991 ; and Carillo et al., SIAM J. Applied Math. (1988) 48, 1073. \n\n\n Preferred methods to determine identity are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Methods to determine identity are described in publicly available computer programs. Preferred computer program methods to determine identity between two sequences include the GCG program package, including GAP (Devereux et al., Nucl. Acid. Res. (1984) 12, 387; Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin,\n\n\nMadison, Wis.), BLASTP, BLASTN, and FASTA (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. (1990) 215, 403- 410). The BLASTX program is publicly available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and other sources (BLAST Manual, Altschul et al. NCB/NLM/NIH \n\n\nBethesda, Md. 20894; Altschul et al., supra). The well known Smith Waterman algorithm may also be used to determine identity. \n\n\n For example, using the computer algorithm GAP (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.), two peptides for which the percent sequence identity is to be determined are aligned for optimal matching of their respective amino acids (the \"matched span\", as determined by the algorithm). A gap opening penalty (which is calculated as 3. times, the average diagonal; the \"average diagonal\" is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used; the \"diagonal\" is the score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the particular comparison matrix) and a gap extension penalty (which is usually {fraction (1/10)} times the gap opening penalty), as well as a comparison matrix such as PAM 250 or BLOSUM 62 are used in conjunction with the algorithm. A standard comparison matrix (see Dayhoff ef al., Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structured 978) 5 for the PAM 250 comparison matrix; Henikoff et al., PNAS USA (1992) 89, 10915-10919 for the BLOSUM 62 comparison matrix) is also used by the algorithm. \n\n\n Preferred parameters for a peptide sequence comparison include the following: Algorithm: Needleman et al., J. Mol. Biol. (1970) 48, 443-453; Comparison matrix: BLOSUM 62 from Henikoff et al., PNAS USA (1992) 89, 10915-10919; Gap Penalty: 12, Gap Length Penalty: 4, Threshold of Similarity: \n\n\n The GAP program is useful with the above parameters.

Used in connection to a hGH compound of the invention, the terms are intended to indicate that the polypeptide chain of said hGH compound is cleaved at a slower rate, compared to wild type hGH, by a protease under specific conditions. \n\n\n The rate of proteolytic cleavage of a protein may be measure by several techniques known to the person skilled in the art. An example of an assay measuring the rate of degradation of hGH or a hGH compound is described in Example 5. \n\n\n The term \"functional in vivo half-life\" is used in its normal meaning, i.e., the time at which 50% of the biological activity of the peptide, for instance a growth hormone compound, wherein the growth hormone compound is still present in the body/target organ, or the time at which the activity of the peptide, for instance growth hormone compound is 50% of its initial value. As an alternative to determining functional in vivo half-life, \"in vivo plasma half-life\", and protracted action may be determined, i.e., the time at which 50% of the peptide circulate in the bloodstream prior to being cleared.

The conjugates may in one embodiment be described by formula (I) \n\n\n A-W-B-GH (I) \n\n\n wherein \n\n\n GH represents a growth hormone compound, \n\n\n A represents a bile acid residue, \n\n\n B represents a hydrophilic spacer covalently linked to GH, \n\n\n W is a chemical group linking A and B; \n\n\n and pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. \n\n\nAs described herein below, the components of such conjugates can be varied by including different growth hormone variants or derivatives, providing additional functionalities while maintaining the stimulating effect on the growth hormone receptor. \n\n\n Additionally, the major functionalities of human growth hormone are usually maintained in the growth hormone conjugate. The in vitro and in vivo activity of a human growth hormone conjugate may be test as any growth hormone compound. \n\n Growth hormone compound \n\n\n According to the invention the growth hormone compound retain the major functionalities of human growth hormone and may in one embodiment be identical to human growth hormone (SEQ ID NO 1 ). \n\n\n In one embodiment of the present invention a growth hormone compound is a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence having at least 20%, such as at least 30%, for instance at least 40%, such as at least 50%, for instance at least 60%, such as at least 70%, for instance at least 80%, such as at least 90% identity, for instance at least 95%, such as at least 96%, for instance at least 97%, such as at least 98% identity to SEQ ID No. 1 . \n\n\n In one embodiment the growth hormone compound has an in vitro activity which is comparable to the in vitro activity of hGH defined by SEQ ID NO 1. In vitro activity of growth hormone compounds is preferably measured in a BAF assay as described in Method 5 herein. \n\n\n In further embodiments as described herein below the growth hormone compound has growth hormone activity of at least 1 %, such as at least 5%, for instance at least 10%, such as at least 25% of the activity of hGH as determined in a BAF assay (described in Method 5 and/or as determined in hyposectomized rats (described in Method 6). \n\n\n In one embodiment the compound may have an in vitro activity which is different from the in vitro activity of hGH. As described above a lower in vitro activity may be compen- sated by other functionalities. \n\n\n In one embodiment the in vitro activity may be such as at least 1 %, such as at least 5%, for instance at least 10%, such as at least 25% of the activity of hGH. In a further embodiment the EC\n50\n ratio for a compound relative to wild type hGH defined by SEQ ID No. 1 is not more that 10, not more than 8, not more than 6, not more than 4, not more than 2. In an embodiment the EC\n50\n ratio for said compound compared to wild type hGH defined by SEQ ID No. 1 is from 5-0.01 or such as from 3-0.01 or such as is from 2-0.01. In an alternative the EC\n50\n may according to the invention be measure by Surface Plasmon Resonance analysis (SPR ) as described in Method 7. In corresponding embodiments the in vitro activity determined by SPR, may be such as at least 1 %, such as at least 5%, for instance at least 10%, such as at least 25% of the activity of hGH. In further embodiments the EC\n50\n ratio for a compound relative to wild type hGH defined by SEQ ID No. 1 determined by SPR is not more that 10, not more than 8, not more than 6, not more than 4, not more than 2. In one embodiment the EC\n50\n ratio for said compound compared to wild type hGH defined by SEQ ID No. 1 is from 5-0.01 or such as from 3-0.01 or such as 2-0.01 . \n\n To avoid doubt, a growth hormone compound may also have a higher activity than hGH in these assays. \n\n\n In one embodiment, where the growth hormone compound is derivatized in some way (additional to the bile acid conjugation), the activity of the growth hormone in relation to hGH may be measured on the un-derivatized growth hormone compound, as the \n\n\nderivatization may change the activity significantly. For instance in the case of a growth hormone compound derivatized with a property-modifying group that prolongs the functional in vivo half-life of the growth hormone compound, the activity of the derivatized growth hormone compound may be much lower than the activity of hGH, which decrease is counteracting by the prolonged residence time. \n\n\n In an alternative embodiment the growth hormone activation may be measured on the derivatized growth hormone compound. And in further embodiments the growth hormone activity is measured on the growth hormone conjugate (including bile acid conjugation) and any additional property modifying chemical modification to ensure that such conjugation and/or modification does not interfere with receptor interaction. It should be noted that the test are to be compared to hGH on a molar basis or on the relative protein/peptide content e.g. the weight of any derivation or conjugation should not be included. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the growth hormone compound is a fragment of such a polypeptide, which fragment has retained a significant amount of the growth hormone activity as described above. \n\n\n In one embodiment the growth hormone compound is a truncated version of hGH, i.e. one or more amino acid residues have been deleted from the N- and/or C-termini corresponding to SEQ No. 1 wherein the said compound retain desired biological properties of wild type hGH. \n\n\n In one embodiment the growth hormone compound has increased in vivo half life.\n\n\nIn one embodiment the growth hormone compound has increased shelf life. \n\n\n In one embodiment the growth hormone compound may be a fusion protein. \n\n\n In one embodiment of the present invention the growth hormone compound is chemically modified (additional to the bile acid conjugate) via attaching moieties such as, but not limited to, PEGs, carbohydrates, albumin binders, fatty acids, alkyl chains, lipophilic groups, vitamins or spacers to the side chains or main chain of the growth hormone compound. \n\n\n In one embodiment the growth hormone compound is chemically modified in order to facilitate transport across the epithelia when compared to hGH or a hGH variant not chemically modified. The chemical modification may be such as the conjugation of a cholic \n\n acid residue as describe herein. Different assays such as a Caco-2 cell assay or a MDCK cell assay may be used to estimate transport of growth hormone compounds across a cell layer. \n\n\n In one embodiment the growth hormone compound of the present invention is chemically modified in order to obtain a prolonged duration of in vivo action. \n\n\n In one embodiment of the present invention a growth hormone compound is chemically modified in order to obtain a prolonged duration of functional in vivo half-life. \n\n\n In one embodiment the chemical modifications of the growth hormone compound may be transient in nature, i.e. they may readily be removed in vivo. \n\n\n In one embodiment the growth hormone compound modifications can take place at any amino acid residue not interfering with binding of the growth hormone compound to the human growth hormone receptor (hGHR). \n\n\n In further embodiments as described below the conjugation may occur at different positions selected from wt hGH residues and from mutant residues. \n\n\n In one embodiment the conjugation is attached via the N-terminal or the C-terminal.\n\n\nIn one embodiment the conjugation is attached via a Gin residue, such as Gin 40 or\n\n\nGin 141 . \n\n\n In such further embodiments where either the bile acid linker (or an alternative derivative) is attached to GH via a mutant residue the GH of the conjugate may have a single Cys mutation selected from any one of a single Cys mutation in the N-terminal, H1 , L1 , H2, L2 or H3 regions of GH. \n\n\n In further such embodiments, the single Cys mutation is positioned in the N-terminal, the mutation being such as any one of T3C, P5C, S7C, or in H1 (corresponding to AA 9-35), the mutation being such as any one of D1 1 C, H18C, Q29C, E30C, E33C, A34C, Y35C or in L1 corresponding to AA 36-71 , the mutation being such as any one of Q40C, K41 C, Y42C, S55C, S57C, S62C or in H2, L2 or H3 (corresponding to AA 72-98, AA 99-106 and AA 107- 127), the mutation being such as any one of E88C, Q91 C, S95C, A98C, N99C, S100C, L101 C, V102C, Y103C, D107C, S108C, D1 12C, Q122C and G126C of hGH (SEQ ID NO:1 ). If the single Cys mutation is present in an hGH variant the mutation is located in correspond- ing amino acid residues. \n\n\n Further embodiments includes GH conjugates wherein the single Cys mutation in GH is selected from any one of: T3C, P5C, S7C, D1 1 C, H18C, Q29C, E30C, E33C, A34C, Y35C, Q40C, S55C, S57C, S62C, E88C, Q91 C, S95C, A98C, N99C, S100C, L101 C, V102C, Y103C, D107C, S108C, D1 12C, Q122C and G126C of hGH (SEQ ID NO:1 ), such as any one of Q40C, S62C and L101 C. \n\n In even further embodiments the single Cys mutation is located within AA 93-106 in hGH or corresponding residues in hGH variants. \n\n\n In further specified embodiments the single Cys mutation is located within L2, such as within AA 99-106 or AA 99-103 or corresponding residues. \n\n\n In order to obtain a growth hormone conjugate with prolonged in vivo residence time it is attractive to optimise the stability of the growth hormone compound, and especially to apply growth hormone compounds which are less susceptible to protein degradation. \n\n\n In one embodiment the growth hormone compound has increased protease stability.\n\n\nIn one embodiment the growth hormone compound has increased stability towards proteolytic cleavage. \n\n\n In one embodiment the growth hormone compound has increased stability towards proteolytic degradation by a pancreatic protease. \n\n\n In one embodiment the growth hormone compound has increased stability towards proteolytic degradation by proteases present in the gastrointestinal tract. \n\n\n In one embodiment the growth hormone compound has increased stability towards proteolytic degradation by proteases present in mammalian plasma. \n\n\n In one embodiment the growth hormone compound has one or more additional disulphide bond(s). The disulphide bonds are formed between pairs of cysteines of which one or both are introduced by point mutations in the wild type hGH sequence. The sites of muta- tion are chosen such that the introduced cysteine residues are appropriately placed in the three dimensional structure of the folded protein to allow for the formation of a disulphide bond. If only one cysteine is introduced, its partner in forming a disulphide bond will include one of the four cysteine residue present in wild type hGH. The folded protein with the additional disulphide bond may be obtained by expressing the appropriate cysteine mutant of hGH in soluble form by a suitable host organism, or recovered from inclusion bodies using standard refolding conditions for growth hormone compounds, which are well known to those skilled in the art (Cabrita and Bottomley, Biotechnology Annual Review (2004) 10, 31 -50). The identification of candidate positions for introduction of additional disulphide bonds can be aided by computational methods, e.g. using the experimentally determined three dimensional structure of hGH (PDB accession code 1 HWG) in complex with two copies of its binding protein. Selection of appropriate positions for introduction of disulphide bond can be based distance and geometry criteria for disulphide bonds described in Dombkowski A., A., Bioinfor- matics (2003) 19, 1852-1853 and Petersen et al., Protein Eng. (1999) 12, 535-548. \n\n\n The cysteine mutants are chosen such that the introduced disulphide bonds do not disrupt the native structure of the protein and have minimal negative impact on the desired \n\n biological activity associated with hGH. Thus, the compounds are constructed such that the introduced disulphide bonds do not impair interaction with hGHR. The regions in hGH important for receptor interaction have been identified from 1 HWG. Thus, the selection of appropriate positions for introducing disulphide bonds, which are neutral with respect to biological activity, can be guided by analyzing the 1 HWG structure. \n\n\n The cysteine mutants may be chosen such that the introduced disulphide bonds provide increased stability towards proteolytic cleavage. The susceptibility of a protein to protease cleavage is defined in part by the primary amino acid sequence of said protein. Proteases may be relatively unspecific or may, with variable degree of selectivity, recognize specific motifs in the primary amino acid sequence. However, the three dimensional structure and dynamics of the protein molecule acting as a substrate strongly influence proteolytic stability. Highly flexible and dynamic loop structures are particularly vulnerable to protease catalyzed cleavage, whereas well structured regions are generally less so. Thus, protection against proteolytic cleavage can be obtained by stabilizing dynamic regions of a protein by introducing disulphide bonds. \n\n\n For disulphide bridges between two cysteine residues, the cysteine residues may be introduced or substituted in any of the regions or positions as defined herein in order to facilitate formation of one or more additional disulphide bonds. Substitution and insertions of amino acid residues can be carried out by standard techniques known to a person skilled in the art. \n\n\n In one embodiment the growth hormone compound comprises one or more additional disulfide bond(s) compared to hGH as defined by SEQ ID NO 1 . As described herein above the polypeptide of a growth hormone compound according to the invention preferably has a high level of identity to human growth hormone identified by SEQ ID NO 1. \n\n\n Accordingly, stable GH compounds made resistant to proteolytic degradation by introduction of one or more additional disulphide bonds in hGH as defined by SEQ ID No.1 is subject to conjugation of a bile acid residue as described herein. In one embodiment the growth hormone compound is stabilized towards proteolysis. \n\n\n In one embodiment the increased proteolytic stability of growth hormone compound is achieved by introducing a disulphide bond between a loop segment and a helical structure. \n\n\n In one embodiment the increased proteolytic stability of growth hormone compound is achieved by introducing a disulphide bond within a loop segment. \n\n\n In one embodiment the increased proteolytic stability of growth hormone compound is achieved by introducing a disulphide bond between loop segments. \n\n In one embodiment the increased proteolytic stability of growth hormone compound is achieved by introducing a disulphide bond between helices. \n\n\n In one embodiment at least one of the introduced disulphide bonds links two cysteine residues of a growth hormone compound, wherein at least one of said cysteine residues is not present in wild type hGH. \n\n\n In one embodiment the introduced disulphide bond(s) of the growth hormone compound stabilize the loop connecting H3 and H4 (L3, residues 128-154), i.e. at least one of the cysteines in the introduced disulphide bond is positioned in the segment comprising residues 128-154 (Figure 1 and 2). \n\n\n In one embodiment the introduced disulphide bonds of a growth hormone compound are positioned between cysteine residues that are selected using distance and geometry criteria described in Dombkowski A., A., Bioinformatics (2003) 19, 1852-1853 and Petersen et al., Protein Eng. (1999) 12, 535-548. \n\n\n As described above the growth hormone compound comprising an additional disulfide bond connecting a loop segment and a helical segment or within a loop segment or connecting loop segments or connecting helical segments of the polypeptide. The location of any such additional disulfide bond is for the purpose of this application described with reference to the polypeptide of hGH as defined in SEQ ID NO 1. Non limiting examples of Cys mutations providing linkage connecting helix's, loops and a loop and a helix are listed in the table below. \n\n\n First Amino Acid as Second Amino Acid Secondary

Further included are natural variants of hGH, such as the 20 kDa described by Masuda.N et al, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 949 (1988) (1 ), 125-131. \n\n\n In all embodiments described herein it is a further option that the growth hormone compound has a Gly residue in a position corresponding to position 120 of SEQ ID NO 1. \n\n\n The growth hormone polypeptides described herein can be prepared according to Method 1 and 2 and as described herein below by the person skilled in the art. \n\n\n The production of polypeptides is well known in the art. For example, polypeptides may be produced by classical peptide synthesis, e.g. solid phase peptide synthesis using iert-Boc or Fmoc chemistry or other well established techniques, see e.g. Greene and Wuts, \"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis\", John Wiley & Sons, 2006. \n\n\n The polypeptides may also be produced by a method which comprises culturing a host cell containing a DNA sequence encoding the polypeptide and capable of expressing the polypeptide in a suitable nutrient medium under conditions permitting the expression of the peptide. For polypeptides comprising non-natural amino acid residues, the recombinant cell should be modified such that the non-natural amino acids are incorporated into the polypeptide, for instance by use of tRNA mutants. \n\n\n The polypeptides may also be produced using cell-free in vitro transcription/- translation systems. A polypeptide containing novel unnatural amino acids may also be produced using frame shift or nonsense suppression systems e.g. as described in J. Am. Chem. Soc. (2003) 125, 1 1782-1 1783, Science (2003) 301, 964-967, Science (2001 ) 292, 498-500, Science (2004) 303, 371 -373 and references herein. \n\n\n The medium used to culture the cells may be any conventional medium suitable for growing the host cells, such as minimal or complex media containing appropriate \n\n\nsupplements. Suitable media are available from commercial suppliers or may be prepared according to published recipes (e.g. in catalogues of the American Type Culture Collection). The peptide produced by the cells may then be recovered from the culture medium by conventional procedures including separating the host cells from the medium by \n\n centrifugation or filtration. For extra cellular products the proteinaceous components of the supernatant are isolated by filtration, column chromatography or precipitation, e.g. \n\n\nmicrofiltration, ultrafiltration, isoelectric precipitation, purification by a variety of \n\n\nchromatographic procedures, e.g. ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like, dependent on the type of polypeptide in question. For intracellular or periplasmic products the cells isolated from the culture medium are disintegrated or permeabilised and extracted to recover the product polypeptide or precursor thereof. \n\n\n The DNA sequence encoding the polypeptide may suitably be of genomic or cDNA origin, for instance obtained by preparing a genomic or cDNA library and screening for DNA sequences coding for all or part of the peptide by hybridisation using specific DNA or RNA probes in accordance with standard techniques (see, for example, Sambrook, J, Fritsch, EF and Maniatis, T, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 1989). The DNA sequence encoding the polypeptide may also be prepared synthetically by established standard methods, e.g. the phosphoamidite method described by Beaucage and Caruthers, Tetrahedron Letters (1981 ) 22, 1859-1869, or the method described by Matthes et al., EMBO Journal (1984) 3, 801 -805. The DNA sequence may also be prepared by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers, for instance as described in US 4,683,202 or Saiki et al., Science (1988) 239, 487-491 . \n\n\n The DNA sequence encoding the peptide to be expressed may be inserted into any vector which may conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures, and the choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector which exists as an extra- chromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. \n\n\n The vector may be an expression vector in which the DNA sequence encoding the polypeptide is operable linked to additional segments required for transcription of the DNA, such as a promoter. The promoter may be any DNA sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell. Examples of suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the DNA encoding the peptide to be expressed in a variety of host cells are well known in the art, cf. for instance Sambrook ef a/., supra. \n\n The DNA sequence encoding the peptide to be expressed may also, if necessary, be operably connected to a suitable terminator, polyadenylation signals, transcriptional enhancer sequences, and translational enhancer sequences. The recombinant vector of the invention may further comprise a DNA sequence enabling the vector to replicate in the host cell in question. \n\n\n The vector may also comprise a selectable marker, for instance a gene the product of which complements a defect in the host cell or one which confers resistance to a drug, for instance ampicillin, kanamycin, tetracyclin, chloramphenicol, neomycin, hygromycin or methotrexate. For large scale manufacture the selectable marker may for instance not be antibiotic resistance, e.g. antibiotic resistance genes in the vector may be excised when the vector is used for large scale manufacture. Methods for eliminating antibiotic resistance genes from vectors are known in the art, see e.g. US 6,358,705 which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n To direct the peptide to be expressed into the secretory pathway of the host cells, a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepro-sequence or pre- sequence) may be provided in the recombinant vector. The secretory signal sequence is joined to the DNA sequence encoding the peptide in the correct reading frame. Secretory signal sequences are commonly positioned 5' to the DNA sequence encoding the peptide. The secretory signal sequence may be that normally associated with the peptide or may be from a gene encoding another secreted protein. \n\n\n The procedures used to ligate the DNA sequences coding for the peptide to be expressed, the promoter and optionally the terminator and/or secretory signal sequence, respectively, and to insert them into suitable vectors containing the information necessary for replication, are well known to persons skilled in the art (cf., for instance, Sambrook et al., supra). \n\n\n The host cell into which a DNA sequence or recombinant vector is introduced may be any cell which is capable of producing the present peptide and includes bacteria, yeast, fungi and higher eukaryotic cells. Examples of suitable host cells well known and used in the art are, without limitation, E. coil, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or mammalian BHK or CHO cell lines. The peptide to be expressed can also be produced by using in vitro \n\n\ntranscription/translation systems commonly known in the art. \n\n\nBile acid linker \n\n\n The present invention in an aspect relates to a bile acid linker. A growth hormone conjugate according to the invention may be prepared as described in the Chemistry section \n\n below. The method of conjugation involves covalent linkages of a bile acid linker, which dependent on the method employed may be described by the formulas: \n\n\n A-W-BI -NH2, A-W-B1-CHO, A-W-B1-LG, A-W-B1-C(0)NHCH\n2\n-CH=CH\n2\n and \n\n\n O \n\n\n A-W-B1 -NHC(0)CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n- N \n\n\n O \n\n\nwherein A represents a bile acid residue, B1 represents a hydrophilic spacer, and W is a chemical group linking A and B1. Further details with regards to A, W and B1 is provide below in relation to the bile acid residue, the spacer and the linking group W. \n\n\nB1 may be seen as a part of B as described in the following: \n\n\n A-W-BI -NH\n2\n -> A-W-B1-NH-GH -> A-W-B-GH (B = B1-NH) \n\n\n A-W-B1-CHO -> A-W-BI -CH\n2\n-GH -> A-W-B-GH (B = B1-CH\n2\n-) \n\n\n A-W-B1-LG -> A-W-B1-GH -> A-W-B-GH (B1 = B) \n\n\n A-W-B1-C(0)NHCH\n2\n-CH=CH\n2\n -> A-W-B1-C(0)NHCH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-GH -> A-W-B-GH (B = B1-C(0)NHCH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-) and \n\n\nA-W-B-GH \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBile acid residue \n\n\n Bile acids occur in nature in various forms which may additionally be subject to modification prior to conjugation to the growth hormone compound. \n\n\n According to the invention the growth hormone conjugate comprise a bile acid residue (A) selected from the group consisting of: cholanic acid, cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, glycocholate, glycodeoxycho- late, glycochenodeoxycholate, taurocholate, taurodeoxycholate and taurochenodeoxycho- late. \n\n\n In one embodiment the bile acid linker and/or the growth hormone conjugate comprises a bile acid residue (A) selected from the group consisting of: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Deoxycholic acid Deoxycholic acid Litocholic acid \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Taurocholate Taurocholate \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein ( \n*\n ) represents the attachment point to the hydrophilic spacer (B) through W. \n\n\n In one embodiment the bile acid residue (A) is a cholic acid residue, such a cholic acid residue is selected from: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cholic acid Cholic acid \n\n\n and wherein ( \n*\n ) represents the attachment point to the hydrophilic spacer (B) through W. \n\n\n As seen from the above the cholic acid residue may in one embodiment be linked to the hydrophilic spacer (B) through W via position \"3\", \"7\", \"12\" or \"24\" of the cholic acid residue. \n\n\n In one embodiment the the cholic acid residue is linked to the hydrophilic spacer (B) through W via position \"3\", \"7\" or \"12\". \n\n\n In one embodiment the the cholic acid residue is linked to the hydrophilic spacer (B) through W via position \"3\". \n\n\n In one embodiment the the cholic acid residue is linked to the hydrophilic spacer (B) through W via position \"7\" . \n\n\n In one embodiment the the cholic acid residue is linked to the hydrophilic spacer (B) through W via position \"12\". \n\n\nHydrophilic spacer \n\n\n The bile acid linker and/or growth hormone conjugate is further characterized by the presence of a hydrophilic spacer. The hydrophilic spacer is aimed and providing a suitable distance from the growth hormone compound and the bile acid residue in order to optimize the functionality of the bile acid linker. Additional functionalities may be associated with groups of spacers as well as individual linkers, such as superior synthesis of conjugates or superior secondary effects. \n\n\n Solubility of a hydrophilic spacer can be described by its logP value. LogP, also known as the partition coefficient, is the logarithm of the ratio of concentrations of a com- \n\n pound in the two phases of a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium. Typically one of the solvents is water while the second is selected from octan-1 -ol, chloroform, cyclohex- ane and propylene glycol dipelargonate (PGDP). LogP values measured in these different solvents show differences principally due to hydrogen bonding effects. Octanol can donate and accept hydrogen bonds whereas cyclohexane is inert. Chloroform can donate hydrogen bonds whereas PGDP can only accept them. \n\n\n In one embodiment of the invention, the hydrophilic spacer has a LogP below -0.5 in either octan-1 -ol, chloroform, cyclohexane and propylene glycol dipelargonate (PGDP). \n\n\n In a further embodiment, the hydrophilic spacer has a logP below -1 in either octan- 1 -ol, chloroform, cyclohexane and propylene glycol dipelargonate (PGDP). \n\n\n Alternatively, the LogP value can be calculated as mLogP and/or cLogP for the hydrophilic spacer part using published algorithms (J. Am. Chem. Soc.(1964), 86 5175-5180 \"A New Substituent Constant, Derived from Partition Coefficients\", C. A. Lipinski et al. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, (1997) 23 3-25, \"Experimental and Computational Approaches to Estimate Solubility and Permeability in Drug Discovery and Development Settings\" and I. Moriguchi, S. Hirono, I. Nakagome, H. Hirano, Chem. and Ph arm. Bull., (1994) 42 976-978 \"Comparison of Reliability of logP Values for Drugs Calculated by Several Methods\". \n\n\n In one embodiment of the present invention the hydrophilic spacer has a mLogP < 0. In a further embodiment, the mLogP of the hydrophilic space is below -0.50, such as below -1 .00. such as below -1 .50, -2.00, -2.50, -3.00, -3.50, -4.00 or 4.50. \n\n\n In one embodiment of the present invention the hydrophilic spacer has a cLogP < 0. In a further embodiment, the cLogP of the hydrophilic space is below -0.50, such as below -1 .00. such as below -1 .50, -2.00, -2.50, -3.00, -3.50, -4.00 or 4.50 or such as below -5.00, - 5.50 or -6.00. \n\n\n When conjugating property modifying groups, such as a cholic acid residue, to polypeptides and proteins the distance between the protein and the cholic acid residue may influence the functionality of the final compound, and thus the use of a hydrophilic spacer may be advantageous. The use of a hydrophilic spacer may increase aqueous solubility of the final compound as well as increase yield and ease of synthesis of such compounds as the conjugation reaction between a linker including a hydrophilic spacer and the protein, usually is performed in a buffered aqueous environment. As seen here below, a hydrophilic spacer as used in the present invention provides a number of negative charges in the form of COOH groups and/or additional polarity in the from of (-CH2-CH2-0-)n repeats, which may both in- dividally influence the solubility positively. \n\n In one embodiment the hydrophilic spacer is a spacer that separates a growth hormone compound and the bile acid residue with a chemical moiety which comprises at least 5 nonhydrogen atoms where 30-50% of these are either N or O. \n\n\n In one embodiment the hydrophilic spacer is a spacer that separates a growth hor- mone compound and the bile acid residue with a chemical moiety which comprises from 0 to 5 COOH groups. \n\n\n In one embodiment the hydrophilic spacer is a spacer that separates a growth hormone compound and the bile acid residue with a chemical moiety which comprises from 0 to 100 -CH2-CH2-O- groups. \n\n\n In one embodiment the hydrophilic spacer (B) comprises at least one OEG motif, the radical 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanic acid, i.e. -NH-(CH\n2\n)2-0-(CH\n2\n)2-0-CH\n2\n-CO-. In further embodiments the hydrophilic spacer comprises at least two OEG motifs. The orientation of such OEG motif(s) is in one embodiment so that the -CO- is closest to the growth hormone compound and the -NH- is closest to the albumin binding residue. \n\n\n In additional embodiments comprising two OEG motifs the two motifs have identical orientation or different orientation. In an embodiment two such OEG motifs are located adjac- tant to each other whereas in alternative embodiments such OEG motifs are separated by one or more atoms covalently linked. \n\n\n In an embodiment the hydrophilic spacer comprise at lease one glutamic acid resi- due. The glutamic acid comprises two carboxylic acid groups. Its gamma-carboxy group may be used for forming an amide bond with the epsilon-amino group of lysine, or with an amino group of an OEG molecule, if present, or with the amino group of another Glu residue, if present. The alfa-carboxy group may alternatively be used for forming similar amide bond with the epsilon-amino group of lysine, or with an amino group of an OEG molecule, if present, or with the amino group of another Glu residue, if present. The amino group of Glu may in turn form an amide bond with the carboxy group of the albumin binding residue, or with the car- boxy group of an OEG motif, if present, or with the gamma-carboxy group or alfa carboxy group of another Glu, if present. \n\n\n In one embodiment the hydrophilic spacer (B) may comprises two or more glutamic acid residue. The linkage of the amino group of one Glu to a gamma-carboxy group of a second Glu may be referred to as a \"gamma-Glu\" motif. \n\n\n In one embodiment the hydrophilic spacer comprise at lease one combined OEG- Glu motif (-NH-(CH\n2\n)2-0-(CH2)2-0-CH2-CO-NH-CH(-COOH)-(CH\n2\n)2-CO-) or at least one combined Glu-OEG motif (-NH-CH(-COOH)-(CH\n2\n)2-CO-NH-(CH2)2-0-(CH2)2-0-CH\n2\n-CO-) or combination here of, where in such Glu-OEG and OEG-Glu motifs may be separated by one \n\n or more covalently liked atoms or directly bond to each other by an amide bond of the Glu's foming a gammal-Glu. \n\n\n In one embodiment the hydrophilic spacer (B) has the formula\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein \n\n\n Xi is -W\n1\n-[(CHR\n3\n)\nl1\n-W\n2\n]\nm1\n-{[(CH\n2\n)\nn1\nE1 ]\nm2\n-[(CHR\n4\n)\nl2\n-W\n3\n]\nm3\n}n2-, \n\n\n X\n2\n is -[(CHR\n5\n)\nl\n3-W4]\nm\n4-{[(CH\n2\n)\nn3\nE2]\nm5\n-[(CHR\n6\n)\nl\n4-W\n5\n] m6}n4 \n\n\n X\n3\n is -[(CHR\n7\n)\nI5\n-W\n6\n]\nm7\n-, \n\n\n X\n4\n is F-D1 -(CH\n2\n)i6-D2-, \n\n\n 11 , I2, I3, I4, I5 and I6 independently are selected from 0-10, \n\n\n ml , m3, m4, m6 and m7 independently are selected from 0-6, \n\n\n m2 and m5 independently are selected from 0-6, \n\n\n n1 , n2, n3 and n4 independently are selected from 0-6, \n\n\n F is aryl, hetaryl, pyrrolidine-2,5-dione or a valence bond, \n\n\n wherein the aryl and hetaryl groups are optionally substituted with halogen, -CN,\n\n\n-OH, -C(0)OH, -C(0)NH\n2\n, -S(0)\n2\nOH or d\n-6\n-alkyl, \n\n\n R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n and R\n7\n independently are selected from hydrogen, -C(0)OH, -C(0)NH\n2\n, -S(0)OH, -S(0)\n2\nOH, -NH-C(=NH)-NH\n2\n, C\n1-6\n-alkyl, aryl or hetaryl; \n\n\n wherein the alkyl, aryl and hetaryl groups optionally are substituted with halogen, -C(0)OH, -C(0)NH\n2\n, -S(0)OH, -S(0)\n2\nOH, -CN or -OH, \n\n\n D1 , D2, E1 and E2 independently are selected from -0-, -N(R\n8\n)-, -N(C(0)R\n9\n)- or a valence bond; wherein R\n8\n and R\n9\n independently represent hydrogen or Ci\n-6\n-alkyl, Wi to W\n6\n independently are selected from -NH-, -C(0)NH-, -NHC(O)-, -C(0)N HCH\n2\n , -CH\n2\nNHC(0)-, -C(0)NHS(0)\n2\n-, -S(0)\n2\nNHC(0)-, -OC(0)NH-, -NHC(0)0-, \n\n\n -C(0)CH\n2\n-, -NHC(0)Ci\n-6\n-alkyl, -C(0)NHCi\n-6\n-alkyl, -CH\n2\nC(0)-, -C(0)CH=CH-, -CH=CHC(0)-, -(CH\n2\n)\ns2\n-, -C(O)-, or a valence bond; wherein s2 is 0 or 1. \n\n\nIn further specified embodiments the space is as defined above, wherein \n\n\n11 , I2, I3, I4, I5 and I6 independently are 0-6, \n\n\nml , m3, m4, m6 and m7 independently are 0-6, \n\n\nm2 and m5 independently are 0-6, and \n\n\nn1 , n2, n3 and n4 independently are 0-6. \n\n\n In further specified embodiments the space is as defined above, wherein D1 and D2 are independently selected from -O- or a valence bond. \n\n In further specified embodiments the space is as defined above, wherein E1 and E2 are independently selected from -O- or a valence bond. \n\n\n In further specified embodiments the space is as defined above, wherein W-i through W\n6\n independently are selected from the group consisting of: -NH-, -C(0)NH-, -NHC(O)-, -CH\n2\nNHC(0)-, -C(0)NHS(0)\n2\n-, -S(0)\n2\nNHC(0)-, -NHC(0)d\n-6\n-alkyl or -C(0)NHCi\n-6\n-alkyl and a valence bond. \n\n\n In further specified embodiments the space is as defined above, wherein R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n and R\n7\n independently are selected from hydrogen, -C(0)OH, -C(0)NH\n2\n, -S(0)\n2\nOH or Ci\n-6\n- alkyl; wherein the alkyl group optionally is substituted with -C(0)OH, -C(0)NH\n2\n or -S(0)\n2\nOH. \n\n\n In an additional embodiment of the invention the growth hormone conjugate comprises a hydrophilic spacer (B) selected from: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical linking group \n\n\n The bile acid linker and/or growth hormone conjugate is further characterized by the chemical linking group (w) which is determined by the method of synthesis of the cholic acid linker.

General method for preparing a hGH compounds. \n\n\n The gene coding for the growth hormone compound was inserted recombinant into a plasmid vector. Mutations were introduced by using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A suitable E.coli strain was subsequently transformed using the plasmid vector. Protein was expressed as soluble protein with an N-terminal Histidine rich peptide tag suitable for immobilised metal affinity chromatography purification. hGH or GH variants may be expressed with an N-terminal methionine or as a MEAE fusion from which the MEAE sequence is subsequently cleaved off. \n\n\n Cell stock was prepared in 50% glycerol and stored at -80 °C. Glycerol stock strain was inoculated into LBA plates and subsequently incubated at 37 °C overnight. The content of each plate was washed with LB medium and diluted into 500 mL LB+AMP medium for expression. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm until OD\n6\noo 0.6 was reached. Succeeding induction was performed using 0.2 mM IPTG at 30 °C for 6 hrs, giving a final OD\n6\noo of 2.0. Cells were finally harvested by centrifugation. \n\n\n Cells were subsequently suspended in 20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.5 and disrupted using \n\n a cell disrupter at 30kPSI. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation and subsequently subjected to chromatographic purification. \n\n\n The purification was performed using immobilized metal affinity chromatography as capturing step, followed by removal of the peptide tag using di-amino-peptidase from \n\n\nUnizyme. Final purification was achieved by ion-exchange chromatography. The purification could also be achieved by using but not limited to ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, size exclusion chromatography and membrane based separation techniques known to a person skilled in the art. \n\n\nMethod 2. Isolation and purification of Cys mutated GH protein: \n\n\n The method is exemplified using MEAE-hGH[Q84C, Y143C, L101 C]. Alternative mutants may be isolated and purified in a similar way possible with minor modification to the isolation and purification scheme based on common general knowledge in the art. \n\n\n Cells are harvested by centrifugation (6056xG for 30 min) and may be stored at -80 °C. Homogenization: Cell pellets (2580 g) were dissolved in ca. 20 kg buffer (20 mM Tris, 0.1 % Tween-20, 5 mM EDTA, pH = 8.5) and pH adjusted to 8.5 followed by homogenization with two pressures drops 1000 and 200 bar. The cell homogenate (-20 kg) was diluted 1 :1 in 8M urea, resulting in a 4M urea concentration. To this solution was added cystamine 2HCI (18 g) (0.9 g/L) and the resulting mixture incubated over night at 5 °C with gentle stirring. Filtration: The homogenate was filtered by dead end filtration 1.0 and 0.5 μιη resulting in approx. 42 kg permeate. Purification of MEAE-hGH[Q84C, Y143C, L101 C] consists of three chromatographic steps and an enzyme digestion to remove the N-terminal MEAE-sequence. MEAE-hGH[Q84C, Y143C, L101 C] was captured using Q Sepharose XL (GE Healthcare) and eluted by linear gradient elution in a Tris-NaCI buffer, pH 8.5. To the collected pool was added 1 .0 M NaCI before loading onto Phenyl Sepharose 6FF (high sub) (GE Healthcare). Step elution in WFI was used to elute the protein and lower the conductivity for enzyme digestion. \n\n\n The MEAE-sequence was removed using the enzyme DAPI (dipeptidylaminopepti- dase 1 ). DAPI cleaves the two N-terminal amino acids off at a time and stops after AE as the second amino acid in hGH is a proline residue, providing a natural stop for DAPI digestion. Digestion was carried out at 40 °C at a protein concentration of 2 mg/mL, pH 4.3. The reaction was followed by LC-MS and stopped after approx. 60 min when digestion was complete. After cooling to 5 °C, 39% v/v cold ethanol (99%) was added to iso-precipitate the protein and pH was adjusted to 4.9. The reaction mixture was stored at 5 °C for at least 2 hrs. to precipitate the protein. \n\n Precipitated hGH[Q84C, Y143C, L101 C] was re-dissolved in a 7 M urea- triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.5, and purified on Source 30Q (GE Healthcare) to separate target protein from minor amounts of un-cleaved material and other impurities. Final product is eluted by linear gradient elution in a triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.5. Product purity is >97% by RP-HPLC analysis (UV 214 nm). \n\n\nMethod 3. Methods for preparing cholic acid conjugated compounds. \n\n\n1. Coupling of bile acid linker of general formula A-W-B1-CHO to the N-terminal phenylalanine of GH compound (I): \n\n\n The bile acid linker of interest is typically synthesized as dialkyl acetal (i.e. A-W-B1 - CH(OR)\n2\n), and need to be converted into free aldehyde before conjugation. This can be done as follows: The bile acid linker dialkyl acetal is treated with acid (e.g. TFA) and evaporated to dryness. The free aldehyde obtained is used without further purification. \n\n\nA solution of GH in buffer (f.ex. HEPES, pH 7.0) is then added portion wise while maintaining pH at 7.0 by addition of 1 N NaOH. NaCNBH\n3\n dissolved in water is then added portions wise with intervals of 5 min. Typically, a clear solution is obtained after 1 hr. of stirring. The reaction flask is wrapped in tin-foil and the reaction mixture gently stirred at room temperature over night. A reaction sample is analyzed by LC/MS to verify product formation. \n\n\nThe hGH conjugate is then purified using a combination of IEX and HIC chromatography, size exclusion column and ultra-filtration. Usually conjugates are obtained having 95% purity or above. \n\n\n2. Coupling of bile acid linker of general formula A-W-B1-NH2 to transaminated and oxidised GH compound (I) \n\n\n The use of a transglutaminase to attach an aldehyde handle to GH on glutamine residues has previously been described in WO2005/070468. The method may be used in accordance with the present invention for attachment of a bile acid based linker of formula A- W-B1 -NH2. The TGase used is microbial transglutaminase from Streptoverticillium mo- baraense according to US5156956. \n\n\nThe reaction may be performed as follows: GH (I) is initially transaminated with 1 ,3-diamino- 2-propanol (II) as described in WO2005/070468: \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n Gln\n40\n/Gln\n141\n Gln\n40\n/Gln\n141\n \n\n\n I I I I \n\n\nIn next step, transaminated GH (III) is added periodate. The oxidation is typically done at low temperature, such as 4-10 °C over 30 min. optionally in the dark. Periodate may oxidize metheonine residues in GH to their corresponding metheonine sulfoxide residues. To mini- mize this oxidation risk, small molecule organic thioethers may be added during periodate oxidation. A suitable organic thioether is 3-methylthiopropan-1 -ol but the skilled person will be able to suggest others. \n\n\nOxidation of transaminated GH compound (III): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Gin\n40\n Gin\n40\n \n\n\n III IV \n\n\nBuffer change may be performed in order to obtain an acid solution required for efficient sodium cyano borohydride reduction. Typically, an excess of A-W-B1 -NH2 amine is used, and sodium cyanoborohydride may be added in smaller portions over time. \n\n\nReductive amination of (IV) with bile acid linker (V): \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe later reaction may be performed as follows: \n\n\n A solution of oxidized transaminated GH (IV) is added a solution of bile acid linker (V) in a mixture of AcOH (1 ,5 mL) and 50 mM MES (0,5 mL) at pH 6.00. The resulting reaction mixture is gently shaken at RT for 30 min. at which time a NaCNBH\n3\n solution (15 μΙ_, (22 mg NaCNBH\n3\n dissolved in 500 μΙ_ Milli-Q water + AcOH (15 μΙ_))) is added. The sample is covered with tin foil and stirrer over night at RT. \n\n\n The conjugate can be isolated by anion exchange chromatography as follows: Acetic acid is removed by buffer changed with pure water (3X) using Amicon Ultra15 devices (Ultracel 10K tubes) by centrifugation at 4000 rpm/min. for 3 x 8 min. The mixture is then buffer changed to 20 mM TEA, pH: 8.50 using Amicon Filter devises and diluted to a final volume of 50 mL with 20 mM TEA, before loading it on a HiLoad Q Sepharose, 26/10 column. The column is initially washed with 20 mM TEA, pH 8.50 (buffer A) and then eluted with 20 mM TEA, 500 mM NaCI, pH 8.50 (buffer B) using a 0-100%(B) gradient over 20 CV, with a flow rate of 2 mL/min. The pooled fractions were buffer changed 5 times to 10 mM ammo- niumbicarbonate buffer in pure water using Amicon Ultra15 devices (Ultracel 10K tubes) by centrifugation at 4000 rpm/min. for 3 x 8 min. 3. Coupling of bile acid linker of general formula A-W-B1-LG (VIII) to GH compound (VII) having an internal free single cys. \n\n\n 1 ) Liberation of free Cys GH (VII) via reduction of disulfide (VI) with a suitable selective reducing agent [H]: \n\n\n 2) Alkylation of free Cys GH (VII) with a leaving group (LG) activated bile acid linker (VIII) affording Cys conjugated GH compound (IX) \n\n\n \n\n The cysteine residue is optionally protected as a mixed disulfide (GH-S-S-R (VI)) with R being a small organic moiety. Non limited examples of mixed disulfides may include disulfides between cystamine (R = -CH\n2\nCH\n2\nNH\n2\n); cysteine (R = -CH\n2\nCH(C(0)OH)NH\n2\n); homocysteine (R = -CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH(C(0)OH)NH\n2\n); and gluthatione (R = -CH\n2\nCH(C(0)NH- CH\n2\nC(0)OH)NH-C(0)CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH(C(0)OH)NH\n2\n). \n\n\n The derivatization process utilise a bile acid linker A-W-B1 -LG wherein LG represent an inorganic leaving group such as -CI, -Br, -I or an organic leaving group such as mesylate or tosylate. Conjugation of GH with A-W-B1 -LG occurs via nucleophilic substitution (VII -> IX). If the derivatization process emploies maleimides of acryl functionalities as reactive group, conjugation occur by sulfide addition to the double bond of the maleimide or the acry- late functionality. \n\n\n GH conjugates prepared as described in the invention may be purified by standard methods sych as HPLC, size exclussion chromatography and by ion-exchange chromatog- raphy. \n\n\n It should be noted, that the general coupling methods described above merely serves for illustration purposes and a person skilled in the art may chose other buffer solutions, purification methods, and reaction condition for preparing the conjugates. \n\n\nMethod 4. Protein chemical characterization of purified growth hormone compounds. Maldi-Tof mass spectrometry \n\n\n Molecular weights were determined using the Autoflex Maldi-Tof instrument \n\n\n(Bruker). Samples were prepared using alfa-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid as matrix. \n\n\n The intact purified protein was analysed using MALDI-MS. The observed mass corresponded to the theoretical mass deduced from the amino acid sequence. \n\n\n The linkage of the disulfide bonds in each compound may be demonstrated by peptide mapping using trypsin and AspN digestion followed by MALDI-MS analysis of the digest before and after reduction of the disulfide bonds with DTT. \n\n\nCapillary electrophoresis \n\n\n Capillary electrophoresis was carried out using an Agilent Technologies 3DCE sys- tern (Agilent Technologies). Data acquisition and signal processing were performed using Agilent Technologies 3DCE ChemStation. The capillary was a 64.5 cm (56.0 cm efficient length) 50 μιη i.d. \"Extended Light Path Capillary\" from Agilent. UV detection was performed \n\n at 200 nm (16 nm Bw, Reference 380 nm and 50 nm Bw). The running electrolyte was phosphate buffer 50 mM at pH 7 (method A). The capillary was conditioned with 0.1 M NaOH for 3 min, then with Milli-Q water for 2 min and with the electrolyte for 3 min. After each run, the capillary was flushed with milli-Q water for 2 min, then with phosphoric acid for 2 min, and with Milli-Q water for 2 min. The hydrodynamic injection was done at 50 mbar for 4.0 sec. The voltage was +25 kV. The capillary temperature was 30 °C and the runtime was 10.5 min. \n\n\nRP-HPLC \n\n\n RP-HPLC analysis was performed on an Agilent 1 100 system using a Vydac 218TP54 4.6 mm x 250 mm 5 μιη C-18 silica column (The Separations Group, Hesperia). Detection was by UV at 214 nm, 254 nm, 280 nm and 301 nm. The column was equilibrated with 0.1 % TFA H\n2\n0 and the sample was eluted by a suitable gradient of 0 to 90% MeCN against 0.1 % TFA/H2O. \n\n\nLC-MS \n\n\n LC-MS analysis was performed on a PE-Sciex API 100 or 150 mass spectrometer equipped with two Perkin Elmer Series 200 Micro-pumps, a Perkin Elmer Series 200 auto- sampler, a Applied Biosystems 785A UV detector and a Sedex 75 Evaporative Light scattering detector. A Waters Xterra 3.0 mm x 50 mm 5μ C-18 silica column was eluted at 1 .5 mL/min at RT. It was equilibrated with 5% MeCN/0.1 % TFA H\n2\n0 and eluted for 1 .0 min with 5% MeCN/0.1 % TFA/H\n2\n0 and then with a linear gradient to 90% MeCN/0.1 % TFA/H\n2\n0 over 7 min. Detection was by UV detection at 214 nm and Evaporative light Scattering. A fraction of the column eluate was introduced into the ionspray interface of a PE-Sciex API 100 mass spectrometer. The mass range 300 - 2000 amu was scanned every 2 seconds during the run. \n\n\nQuantification of protein \n\n\n Protein concentrations were estimated by measuring absorbance at 280 nm using a\n\n\nNanoDrop ND-1000 UV-spectrophotometer. \n\n\nEnzymatic peptide mapping for determination of site(s) of derivatization \n\n\n Peptide mapping was performed using Asp-N digestion of the reduced and alkylated protein. First the protein was treated with DTT and iodoacetamide according to standard pro- cedures. The alkylated product was purified using HPLC. Subsequently the alkylated purified product was digested overnight with endoprotease Asp-N (Boehringer) at an \n\n enzyme:substrate ratio of 1 :100. The digest was HPLC separated using a C-18 column and standard TFA MeCN buffer system. The resulting peptide map was compared to that of un- derivatized hGH and fractions with different retention times were collected and further analyzed using Maldi-tof mass spectrometry. SDS page \n\n\n SDS poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using NuPAGE 4% - 12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen NP0321 BOX). The gels were silver stained (Invitrogen LC6100) or Coomassie stained (Invitrogen LC6065). Protein chromatography \n\n\n Protein chromatography was performed on an Akta Explorer chromatographic system and columns from GE Health Care. Anion exchange was done using a Q-Sepharose HP 26/10 column. Starting buffer was 20 mM triethanolamine buffer pH 8.5 and eluting buffer was starting buffer + 0.2 M NaCI. The compounds were typically eluted with a gradient of 0- 75% eluting buffer over 15 column volumes. De-salting and buffer exchange was performed using a HiPrep 26/10 column. \n\n\nTNBS test \n\n\n A solution of 10% DIPEA in DMF (solution 1 ) and a solution of 1 M aqueous TNBS (solution 2) was prepared. A few resin beads were placed in a small test tube and 1 -3 drops of each solution (1 and 2) were added. After a short mixing time the mixture was left at RT for 10 min. followed by inspection of the beads. Intensely orange or red beads indicate positive results (i.e presence of free amines); yellow or slightly orange beads indicate slightly positive and colorless beads are negative. Method 5. Analysis of the biological activity of the purified growth hormone \n\n\ncompounds. \n\n\n The biological activity of hGH compounds are measured in a cell based receptor potency proliferation assay, namely a BAF assay. The method is general for the hGH compounds. \n\n\n The BAF-3 cells (a murine pro-B lymphoid cell line derived from the bone marrow) is\n\n\nIL-3 dependent for growth and survival. IL-3 activates JAK-2 and STAT which are the same mediators GH is activating upon stimulation. \n\n The BAF-3 cells are transfected with a plasmid containing the hGH receptor. \n\n\nClones able to proliferate upon stimulation with hGH are turned into hGH-dependent cell lines hereafter referred to as BAF3-GHR. The cell lines respond to GH with a dose-related growth pattern and can therefore be used to evaluate the effect of different hGH compounds in a proliferation assay. \n\n\n The BAF-3GHR cells are grown in starvation medium (culture medium without GH) for 24 hrs. at 37 °C, 5% C0\n2\n. The cells are centrifuged, the medium is removed and the cells are re-suspended in starvation medium to 2,22x10\n5\n cells/ml. Portions of 90 μΙ_ of the cell supernatant are seeded into microtiter plates (96 well NUNC-clone). Different concentrations of growth hormone compound are added to the cells, and the plates are incubated for 72 hrs. at 37 °C, 5% C0\n2\n. \n\n\n AlamarBlue is a redox indicator, AlamarBlue® (BioSource cat no Dal 1025) which is reduced by reactions innate to cellular metabolism and, therefore, provides an indirect measure of viable cell number. The AlamarBlue® is diluted 6 times (5 μΙ_ AlamarBlue® + 25 μΙ_ starvation medium) and 30 μΙ_ of the diluted AlamarBlue® is added to each well. The cells are then incubated for another 4 hrs. Finally the metabolic activity of the cells is measure in a fluorescence plate reader using an excitation filter of 544 nM and an emission filter of 590 nM. \n\n\n The result for a given compound is expressed as the ratio between EC\n50\n of said compound and the EC\n50\n of wthGH run in parallel. \n\n\nMethod 6. In vivo dose-response study in hypophysectomised Sprague Dawley rats Previous 3A \n\n\n The in vivo dose-response relationship may be studied in hypophysectomised male Sprague Dawley rats. The hypophysectomised rat is a well known and recognised animal model of growth hormone deficiency, where no production of growth hormone occurs after the surgical removal of the pituitary gland. This also leads to low circulating levels of insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF-1 ) another important clinical feature of growth hormone deficiency in humans. \n\n\n The hypophysectomy are performed on 4 week old male rats weighing 90-100 g. The animals entered the study 3-4 weeks after the surgery weighing 100-1 10 g. Animals with a body weight gain of more than 10% during the 3-4 weeks after surgery were not allowed to enter the study. \n\n\n Usually seventy hypophysectomised Sprague Dawley rats are randomly allocated to seven dosing groups with ten animals in each group. One group receives vehicle only and \n\n served as an untreated control group. Three groups receives test compound (such as a hGH variant) 33, 3.3 and 0.33 nmol respectively and three groups received hGH as a comparator 50, 5.0 and 0.5 nmol respectively. Both compounds and vehicle were administered as a single subcutaneous dose in the neck. The body weight are measured daily between 8-10am for one week. \n\n\n Evaluation of a dose-dependent increase in body weight may be obtained by com- pareing body weight on Day 0 with that of Day 7. \n\n\n A sigmoidal dose-response equation is fitted to the experimental data (increase in body weight between Day 0-7) by non-linear regression analysis in order to calculate pa- rameter estimates of E\nmax\n, E\n0\n and ED\n50\n. The equation has a sigmoidal dose-response built-in equation in GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, USA). Data including parameter estimates and 95% confidence intervals are usually presented. \n\n\n No difference in parameter estimates of E\n0\n and E\nmax\n was observed for hGH[Q84C, Y143C] and hGH. However ED\n50\n was significantly lower for hGH[Q84C, Y143C] compared to hGH indicating an increased in vivo potency of hGH[Q84C, Y143C]. \n\n\nMethod 7. Receptor interaction studies by Surface plasmon resonance analysis. \n\n\n Receptor interaction of hGH compounds may be analyzed using surface plasmon resonance analysis. The method is general for the hGH compounds. The interaction of hGH and analogues with hGH binding protein (hGHBP) are studied by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore T100 instrument (GE Healtcare, Sweden). Anti-hGH mAb \n\n\n(Fitzgerald Industries International, USA, #10G05B) is immobilized onto a CM-5 chip according to manufacturers instruction at a level of typically 5000 RU. wthGH or analogues were captured at 10-25 μg mL in running buffer (10 mM HEPES, 0.15 M NaCI, 30 mM EDTA, 0.05% Surfactant P20, pH 7.4), which resulted in 250-400 RU captured ligand. hGHBP at a concentration of 0-800 nM is subsequently injected over the surface at 30 μΙ_Ληίη. A surface with immobilized anti-hGH mAb but without captured hGH is used as reference. \n\n\n Kinetic data is analyzed with Biacore™ Evaluation Software 2.0 with the 1 :1 \n\n\nLangmuir binding model. Method 8. Assay for measuring rate of protease degradation of wild type hGH and GH compounds \n\n\n The compound of interest is digested by a relevant protease (Trypsin, \n\n\nChymotrypsin, Pepsin, Elastase, Factor Vila, Factor Xa, Proteinase K, Carboxy peptidase, \n\n DPPIV, Neutral Endopeptidase, Granzyme B, Proline-endopeptidase, Staphylococcal peptidase I, Thermolysin, Thrombin, Arg-C proteinase, Asp-N endopeptidase, Caspase 1 -10, Clostripain, Enterokinase, Glutamyl endopeptidase, Granzyme B, LysC, LysN, Proline- endopeptidase and Staphylococcal peptidase I or tissue extracts.) in an appropriate buffer (e.g. PBS or ammonium bicarbonate) at 37 °C for up till 24 hrs. Proteolytic degradation is assessed by a HPLC assay. \n\n\nProteolytic digestion: \n\n\n 100 μΙ_ of test compound solution at 1 mg/mL in ammonium bicarbonate buffer is degraded by enzyme for up till 24 hrs. at 37 °C. Sub-samples are taken to various time points and the proteolytic reaction is stopped by acidifying the sample by 10 times dilution into 1 % TFA. These diluted samples are analysed by reversed phase HPLC to estimate the degree of proteolytic digestion. \n\n\nHPLC method: \n\n\n 10 μί of the above solution is injected on a reversed phase Vydac C4 2x150 mm column eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1 % TFA in water to 100% MeCN containing 0.1 % TFA over a period of 30 min. at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Detection of peaks is performed at 214 nm UV absorption. % intact compound at time point t=T is calculated from the peak area at time point t=T (A\nT\n) and the peak area at t=0 (A\n0\n) as (Α\nτ\n/Α\n0\n)\nχ\n100%. \n\n\n The results provided in the examples below were obtained after 4 hrs. (T=4 in above equation). % intact compound is plotted against time using GraphPad Prims software ver. 5.01 . T\n½\n is calculated as one phase decay also by GraphPad Prism software. Enzymes used in the example are elastase (Sigma from porcine pancrease) and chymotrypsin (Roche sequencing grade). Buffer is 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.5. \n\n\nMethod 9. Pharmacokinetic properties of growth hormone compounds by intra- intestinal and i.v. administration to Gottingen minipigs \n\n\n Usually eight Gottingen male minipigs obtained from Ellegaard Gottingen Minipigs A S weighing approximately 30 kg are used at the study. After a two week acclimatisation period the animals are subjected to surgery, where two central venous catheters are inserted in each animal. After surgery the animals are housed in their normal individual pens. The animals are weighed prior to dosing. For animals that receive intra-intestinal dosing, straw and bedding material are removed from the pens 2 days prior to dosing in order to ensure absence of foreign material in the Gl tract. \n\n For i.v. dosing 20 nmol/kg is given through the central short catheter, which is flushed with 2 mL saline post administration. \n\n\n For intra-intestinal dosing 800 nmol/kg is administered by an endoscope (Pentax gastroscope). The gastroscope is inserted orally and passed through the oesophagus and ventricle through the pylorus to the jejunum. The test formulation is released in the jejunum and the gastroscope is withdrawn. The minipigs are sedated with Sedator and Propofol during the dosing procedure, and Antisedan is given intramuscularly after the procedure. \n\n\n Bloods samples are usually collected at the following time points: \n\n\ni.v. dosing: Predose, 5 min., 15 min., 30 min., 45 min., 1 , 1 .5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hrs. after dosing. \n\n\n Intra-intestinal dosing: Predose, 15 min., 30 min., 45 min., 1 , 1 .5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hrs. after dosing. \n\n\n At each sampling time 2 mL of blood is drawn from each animal. The blood samples are taken through the central catheter. After each blood sample the catheter is rinsed with 5 mL heparin (10 U/mL) in saline. During sampling the first ml blood is discarded. Aseptic techniques are required during the blood sampling in order to avoid bacterial contamination and the risk of clotting. \n\n\n Blood samples are collected in test tubes containing EDTA 8 mM. Blood samples are kept on ice for max. 20 min. before centrifugation (4000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min.). Plasma is collected immediately and stored at -20 °C until assayed. Plasma samples are analysed for test compounds. \n\n\n Test compound concentrations are determined by a sandwich ELISA using a guinea pig anti-hGH polyclonal antibody as catcher, and biotinylated hGH binding-protein (soluble part of human GH receptor) as detector. The limit of detection of the assay is 0.2 nM. \n\n\n For i.v. administration the compounds are dissolved to 0.6 mM in Glycine 20 mg/ml, Mannitol 2 mg/mL, NaHC0\n3\n 2.4 mg/mL, pH adjusted to 8.2. \n\n\n For intra-intestinal administration the compounds are dissolved to 6 mM in Glycine 20 mg/mL, Mannitol 2 mg/mL, NaHC0\n3\n 2.4 mg/mL, pH adjusted to 8.2. Method 10. Pharmacokinetic properties of growth hormone compounds by intra- intestinal administration to Sprague Dawley rats \n\n\n Usually 24 Sprague Dawley rats, approx. 250-300 g are obtained from Taconic M&B (Rekv. No. 2010 0824). The animals are housed in type IV cages with 4-5 animals in each cage. The rats have free access to drinking water (tap water) during the study, but are fasted \n\n for 18 hrs. prior to dosing. During the fasting the animals are placed in cages on grid without bedding or nesting material and the food is removed at 2pm on the day before dosing in order to ensure a fasting period of at least 18 hrs. During the fasting period the animals have free access to drinking water. \n\n\n At the day of the operation the rats are weighted prior to the anaesthesia in order to make accurate dose calculations of the analgesics. Immediately after weighing, the animals receive a pre-analgesic dose of Rimadyl Vet. 50 mg/mL diluted in Saline (1 +9), 0.1 mL/100 g s.c. \n\n\n Although the study is not a sterile study the operative procedures are carried out as aseptic as possible. The operation area is disinfected with 70% ethanol and precautions are made to minimize the contamination of the surgical area. \n\n\n The rats are anaesthetised with Isofluran 3% in the initial phase until the animals are at sleep, then the Isofluran is reduced to 2-2.5% during the rest of the surgery. The abdomen is shaved and disinfected with 70% ethanol before surgery. \n\n\n Immediately before surgery each rat receives an s.c. dose of Temgesic 0.3 mg/mL diluted in Saline (1 +9), 0.125 mL/100 g. The same dose is given again 1 hr. after dosing and 6-8 hrs. after dosing if the animals are kept overnight. \n\n\n During the anaesthesia the rats are monitored continuously with special emphasis on skin colour and respiration. Since the use of opioids can cause loss of body heat (hypo- thermia), the rats are placed in the heating cupboard at 37 °C during the study. \n\n\n The anaesthetised rats are placed on their backs on a thermic blanket or an insulation plate. A midline incision is made in the skin. A 2 cm incision into the abdominal cavity is made along the linea alba starting approximately 1 cm below the xiphoid cartilage (processus xiphoideus). A section of the jejunum approximately 50-60 cm from the pylorus that makes a significant bend is indentified below a layer of abdominal fat. The test compounds (0.2 mL per animal) are delivered to the jejunum by intra-intestinal injection using a G27 syringe. After dosing the needle is withdrawn carefully and the injection hole closed with a droplet of Histoacryl®. After 30 sec. the intestine is returned into the abdomen and the abdominal wall is closed by surgical sutures (Vicryl 4-0) ensuring that the wound ends are matching closely together. The skin is closed using wound clips. After the wound has been closed the rat is given 2 mL Saline s.c. in the flank to avoid dehydration and is placed in a special recovery cage under a heating lamp. \n\n\n When the animals have completely recovered from the anaesthesia they are placed in the normal cage in the heating cupboard. \n\n 200 μΙ_ blood samples are collected from the tail vein from all animals at the following time points: Predose, 0.5, 1 , 2, 3, 4 and 6 hrs. post injection. Blood samples are collected in test tubes containing EDTA 8 mM. Blood samples are kept on ice for max 20 min. before centrifugation (4000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min.). Plasma samples are collected immediately and stored at -20 °C until assayed. Plasma samples are analysed for test compounds. Test compound concentrations are determined by a sandwich ELISA using a guinea pig anti-hGH polyclonal antibody as catcher, and biotinylated hGH binding-protein (soluble part of human GH receptor) as detector. The limit of detection of the assay is 0.2 nM. \n\n\n For intra-intestinal administration the compounds are dissolved to 1 .5 mM in Glycine 20 mg/mL, Mannitol 2 mg/mL, NaHC0\n3\n 2.4 mg/mL, pH adjusted to 8.2. \n\n\nMethod 11 - Caco-2 permeability assay \n\n\n Caco-2 cells has been used for measuring transport of test compounds across a monolayer of cells. The Caco-2 cell line is derived from a human colorectal carcinoma and is videly use for prediction of drug absorption across the human intestine. A cell layer of differentiated Caco-2 cells resemple the small intestinal columnar epithelium and is therefore use- full for testing transport properties of compound. The apparent permeability coefficients (Pa ) obtained from Caco-2 cell transport studies have been shown to correlate to human intestinal absorption (J.D Irvine et al. J.Pharm.Sci. (1999) 88 and P. Artursson. J.Pharm.Sci. (1990) 79). The assay is performed culturing the cells on semi-permeable membrane. Test compounds are added to the apical side of the cell layer and their appearance on the basolateral side is measured over time and the calculated P\napp\n represents intestinal absorption. \n\n\nMaterials \n\n\n Caco-2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). All cell culture reagents were purchased from LONZA BioWhittaker, unless otherwise noted. Trypsin-EDTA 0,25% from Invitrogen, Gibco (Denmark). MEM (nonessential amino acids) from Invitrogen, Gibco (Denmark), FBS HI from Invitrogen, Gibco (Denmark) and Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) Cat no. 14025 and HEPES Cat no. 15630, were purchased from Invitrogen, Gibco (Denmark). Mannitol, D-[1 -\n3\nH(N)]-, was purchased from Perkin Elmer Danmark A-S. Microscint 40, scintillation fluid, was obtained from Packard Bioscience (Groningen, The Netherlands). \n\n\nCell culture \n\n Caco-2 cells were seeded in culture flasks and passaged ( using DPBS and Trypsin 0,25%- EDTA ) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with Ultraglutamine, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin (100 U/mL and 100 μg mL, respectively), and 1 % nonessential amino acids. The cells (between passages 23-40) were seeded onto tissue culture-treated Transwells™ (Costar, NY, USA) at a density of 10\n5\n cells/cm\n2\n. Transport experiments were subsequently performed on days 22-24 after seeding. Caco-2 cell monolayer cultures were grown in an atmosphere of 5% C0\n2\n-95%0\n2\n and 90% humidity at 37 °C. Growth media were replaced every other day. TEER was measured in Ω cm\n2\n, at 37 °C, using an epithelial voltohmmeter (Millicell® -ers; Millipore, Denmark), the ma- ture Caco-2 cell monolayer exhibited a TEER.> 600 Ω cm\n2\n prior to use in transport experiments. \n\n\nPermeability assay \n\n\n The integrity of the Caco-2 was evaluated via measurement of Mannitol, D-[1 - \n3\nH(N)]-, (0.8 μθί/ιηί) P\napp\n and monitoring the change in TEER over the course of a 2 h experiment. Prior to the experiment, growth media was removed from the mature Caco-2 cells and the monolayers were rinsed once with 37 °C HBSS. All compound transport experiments were carried out using a 200 μΜ solution of the test compound and the apical volume was 400 μΙ_ and the basolateral volume was 1000 μΙ_. In the transport experiments, test com- pounds were added in the apical compartment at pH 7.4 and 200 μΙ_ was removed from the basolateral compartment at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 120 min, and the basolateral compartment was then replenished with 200 μΙ_ of fresh, preheated buffer. At 120 min, a 2x10 μΙ_ sample was taken from the donor compartment in order to establish the concentration of compound at the end of the experiment. All experiments were conducted at 37 °C for 2 h. Samples con- taining radioactive controls Mannitol, D-[1 -\n3\nH(N)], were analyzed using TopCount NXT from Packard, while samples containing test compound were analyzed using using Luminescence Oxygen Channeling Immunoassay (LOCI), which is a homogenous bead based assay. LOCI reagents include two latex bead reagents and a biotinylated antibody, which is one of the antibodies in the sandwich. One of the bead reagents was a generic reagent (donor beads) coated with streptavidin and containing a photosensitive dye. The second bead reagent (acceptor beads) was coated with the other antibody making up the sandwich. During the assay the three reactants combine with analyt to form a bead-aggregate-immune complex. Illumination of the complex releases singlet oxygen from the donor beads which channels into the acceptor beads and triggers chemiluminescence which was measured in the EnVision plate \n\n reader. The amount of light generated was proportional to the concentration of test compound. Sample/calibrator/control were diluted 10x in assay buffer. 1 μΙ_ diluted sample/calibrator/control was applied in 384-well LOCI plates. 15 μΙ_ of a mixture of biotinylated mAb HGH-7 (ES 7) and mAb HGH-3A7 (ES3) -conjugated acceptor-beads was added to each well (21 -22 °C). The plates were incubated for 1 h at 21-22 °C. 30μΙ_ streptavidin coated donor-beads (67 μg mL) was added to each well and all were incubated for 30 minutes at 21 -22 °C. The plates were read in an Envision plate reader at 21 -22 °C with a filter having a bandwidth of 520-645 nm after excitation by a 680 nm laser. The total measurement time per well was 210 ms including a 70 ms excitation time. \n\n\nCalculation of permeability \n\n\n The accumulated amount of test compound appearing in the basolateral compartment over time, dQ/di, was used to calculate the P\napp\n using the following equation: P\napp\n =dQ/dtxM(AC\n0\n), where A is the area of the filter (1 cm\n2\n ) and C\n0\n is the initial concentration in the donor compartment. \n\n\nPreparation of bile acid linkers Linker 1 : - NN-AU-0087 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials \n\n\n Solid Support: PAM resin 0.7-1.3 mmol/g, 100-200 mesh, Sigma. \n\n\n Fmoc-8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctonic acid, MSNT (1 -(Mesitylene-2-sulfonyl)-3-nitro-1 ,2,4-triazole) (from Chemimpex), Fmoc-Glu-O'Bu (Novabiochem), Fmoc-Gly-OH (GL Biochem), cholic acid (Sigma). \n\n Attachment of Fmoc-Gly-OH to PAM resin \n\n\n PAM resin (3 g, 3.3 mmol) was swelled in dry DCM (distilled over P\n2\n0\n5\n) for 1 hr. Fmoc-Gly-OH (4.9 g, 5 eq, 16.5 mmol), MSNT (4.9 g, 5 eq, 16.5 mmol), N-methyl imidazole (0.75 mL, 3.75 eq, 12.4 mmol) was dissolved in dry DCM (20 mL) containing 2-3 drops of THF. This solution was then added to the pre-swelled resin. The resin was allowed to rotate in a Robbins scientific rotator at RT. After 2 hrs. of reaction the resin was filtered and washed with DCM (6 x 10 mL) and DMF (6 x 10 mL). The process was repeated once again in identical conditions. Removal of Fmoc group of Fmoc-Gly-PAM: \n\n\n The Fmoc group of the Fmoc-Gly-PAM was deprotected by treating it twice with a solution of 20% (v/v) piperidine/DMF (15 mL) for 5 and 15 min. respectively. The resin was then filtered and washed with DMF (10 x 5 mL), DCM (6 x 10 mL) and DMF (6 x 10 mL). The deprotection of Fmoc group was confirmed by positive ninhydrin test. \n\n\nGeneral procedure for successive coupling of Fmoc-amino acids/linker/cholic acid. \n\n\n The Fmoc-deprotected amine resin was swelled in DMF. Pre-activated solution of Fmoc protected amino acid (5 equiv. respective to resin loading) HOBt (5 equiv.) and DIC (5 equiv.) in dry DMF was added to the pre-swelled resin and the reaction mixture was rotated at RT for 3 hrs. The resin was filtered and washed with DMF (6 x 5 mL), DCM (6 x 5 mL) and DMF (6 x 5 mL). The completion of coupling reaction was confirmed by negative ninhydrin test. \n\n\nGeneral procedure for coupling of cholic-succinic acid. \n\n\n The Fmoc-deprotected amine resin was swelled in DMF. Pre-activated solution of cholic-succinic acid (3 equiv. respective to resin loading), HOBt (3 equiv.) and DIC (3 equiv.) in dry DMF was added to the pre-swelled resin and the reaction mixture was rotated at RT for 16 hrs. The resin was filtered and washed with DMF (6 x 5 mL), DCM (6 x 5 mL) and DMF (6 x 5 mL). The completion of coupling reaction was confirmed by negative ninhydrin test. \n\n\nCleavage of f-Butyl groups from peptidyl resin \n\n\n After the sequential attachment of target molecule to solid phase, the resin was washed with ether (6 x 10 mL) and dried in a vacuum desiccator overnight. The cleavage of the peptides from the solid support was achieved by treating the peptide-resin with a cleav- age cocktail consisting of 95% TFA, 2.5% TIS, 2.5% water (25 mL) at RT for 1 hr. The resin \n\n was then washed with DCM (2 x 5 mL), DMF (2 x 5 mL), DCM (2 x 5 mL). The dried i-butyl side chain cleaved peptide resin was treated with a mixture of CHCI\n3\n / aminoacetalde- hydedimethylacetal (54:36) mL at 45 °C for 26 hrs. After cleavage the resin was drained and washed with DCM, MeOH, H\n2\n0, 0.1 % TFA, HFIP, DCM, MeOH and DCM. Filtrates were polled and evaporated in vacuum and the resulting oil dissolved in a given volume of distilled water. The pH was adjusted to 7 with TFA and the solution was freezed and lyophilized to yield crude product. The crude product was purified by preparative HPLC affording 263 mg of the compound which identity was confirmed by LC-MS.

The ice bath was removed and the mixture stirred for 80 min. at which time it was re-cooled and tert- butanol (300 mL, 3.16 mol) added. After stirring for 7 hrs at RT, aq. ammonia (280 mL, 25% w/w) was added with cooling, keep the temperature below 20 °C, and the solution was left for 12 hrs. at RT. Another portion of aq. ammonia (100 mL) was added and after a further 4 hrs at RT the mixture was partitioned between diethyl ether (2 L) and water (1 L). (The progress of trifluoroacetate hydrolysis is monitored by TLC with EtOAc as eluent RF = 0.4). The organic phase was washed with 2N NaOH solution (6 x 1 L), water (6 x 1 L), brine (1 L) and dried over sodium sulphate. The organic phase was filtered and the volatiles evaporated un- der reduced pressure affording cholic acid iert-butyl ester as a solid (54 g, 95%), pure by TLC and \n1\nH-NMR. \n\n\nStep-2: Synthesis of cholic-ONH\n2\n from cholic acid tert butyl ester: \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n Cholic acid t-butyl ester Cholic acid t-butyl ester ONH\n2\n \n\n\nCholic iert-butyl ester (15 g, 32.3 mmol) was dissolved in THF (150 ml_). Triphenyl phosphine (16.9 g, 2 eq, 64.6 mmol) and N-hydroxyphthalimide (10.5 g, 2 eq, 64.6 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture at 0 °C. DEAD (13 mL, 2.5 eq, 80.8 mmol) was added dropwise over a period of 1 hr. After complete addition the reaction mixture was allowed to reach RT and stirred over night. The volatiles were removed under reduced pressure. The residual oil was dissolved in EtOH (100 mL), hydrazine hydrate (12 mL, 247.3 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was heated at 45 °C for 3 hrs at which point TLC indicated completeness of the reaction.
