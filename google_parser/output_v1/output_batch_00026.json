The best known of these is ubiquitin's role in protein degradation, where covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a target protein enables that target protein to be recognized and destroyed by the 26S proteasome (see Wilkinson, Semin. Cell Devel. Biol. 11(3): 141-148 (2000)). Protein kinase regulation of various signaling pathways has also been correlated with ubiquitination (see Sun and Chen, Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 16: 119-126 (2004)). For example, phosphorylation of IκB by IκB kinase permits ubiquitination of IκB and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome; because IκB is an inhibitor of NFκB, the degradation of IκB activates NFκB (Ghosh and Karin, Cell 109 (Suppl.): S81-S96 (2002); Palombella et al., Cell 78: 773-785 (1994)). Ubiquitination also mediates DNA repair (see Sun and Chen, Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 16:119-126 (2004)). After DNA is damaged, monoubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) activates damage-tolerant polymerases which are able to synthesize DNA despite any DNA lesions (Stelter and Ulrich, Nature 425: 188-191 (2003). Other physiological processes in which ubiquitination is known to be involved include cell division, cell growth, cell movement, and apoptosis/cell death (Johnson, Nat. Cell Biol. 4:E295-E298 (2002); Pickart, Mol. Cell. 8: 499-504 (2001)).\n\n\nThe covalent attachment of ubiquitin, a 76 amino acid protein, to a target protein is a three-step enzymatic process (Pickart, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 70: 503-533 (2001)). First, ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 forms an ubiquitin-E1 thioester in an ATP-dependent reaction. The ubiquitin is transferred from the ubiquitin-E1 thioester to a member of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) family in the second step. In the third step, with the assistance of a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3), an isopeptide bond is formed between the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin and the ε-amino group of a lysine residue on the target protein. Enzymes termed deubiquitinases remove ubiquitin moieties from target proteins (Guterman and Glickman, Curr. Prot. Pep. Sci. 5: 201-210 (2004)). Highlighting ubiquitin's role as an important regulatory molecule, the human genome contains many different proteins involved in ubiquitination or deubiquitination: at least 40 different E2s, 500 different E3s, and 80 different deubiquitinases have been identified thus far (Wong et al., Drug. Discov. Today 8: 746-754 (2003)).\n\n\nUbiquitin contains seven lysine residues (Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys33, Lys29, Lys48, and Lys63), and thus ubiquitin itself may serve as a target protein for ubiquitination (Peng et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 21: 921-926 (2003); Pickart and Fushman, Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 8:610-616 (2004)). The molecule produced upon ubiquitination of a ubiquitin protein is termed a polyubiquitin molecule, and may comprise two or more ubiquitin moieties. Ubiquitination of ubiquitin may theoretically occur at any of the seven lysine residues (Peng et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 21: 921-926 (2003)), so that different species of polyubiquitins exist having isopeptide bonds to different lysine residues within ubiquitin. It is possible that a single polyubiquitin molecule with greater than two ubiquitin moieties may have more than one type of lysine linkage. Studies have shown that the E2 enzyme influences the type of lysine linkage created between one ubiquitin molecule and another (Tenno et al., Genes to Cells 9: 865-875 (2004); Deng et al. (2000); Hofmann and Pickart (2001)). Polyubiquitin and ubiquitin exist both as free molecules and in covalent attachment with a target protein.\n\n\nLike ubiquitin, polyubiquitin involvement has been found in many cellular processes, including intracellular trafficking, endocytosis, gene expression/silencing, proteolysis, kinase activation, translation, and DNA repair (Hoege et al., Nature 419:135-141 (2002); Spence et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 15:1265-1273 (1995); Hofmann and Pickart, Cell 96: 645-653 (1999). Polyubiquitin and polyubiquitination can have strikingly different physiological roles than monoubiquitin and monoubiquitination in the same pathways, however. For example, whereas monoubiquitination of PCNA after DNA damage results in the activation of error-prone DNA polymerases, polyubiquitination of PCNA at the identical residue where monoubiquitination is observed results in activation of error-free DNA repair (Stelter and Ulrich, Nature 425: 188-191 (2003); Hoege et al., Nature 419:135-141 (2002); Spence et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 15:1265-1273 (1995); and Hofmann and Pickart, Cell 96: 645-653 (1999)).\n\n\nEven polyubiquitins having different lysine linkages appear to play different physiological roles. The two best-studied are the Lys48-linked and Lys63-linked polyubiquitins, and structural studies of the two suggest that different lysine-linked polyubiquitins may adopt markedly different conformations, thus permitting different interactions with selected binding partners (Tenno et al., Genes to Cells 9: 865-875 (2004)). Covalent modification by Lys48-linked polyubiquitin typically marks the target protein for proteolytic degradation, though there is some evidence that Lys48-linked polyubiquitin may also regulate certain proteins by non-proteolytic means (Chau et al., Science 243: 1576-1583 (1989); Finley et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 14: 5501-5509 (1994); Flick et al., Nat. Cell. Biol. 6:634-641 (2004)). Lys63-linked polyubiquitins, in contrast, have been linked to a variety of nonproteolytic intracellular pathways, including DNA repair (yeast cells expressing K63R-ubiquitin are defective in DNA repair), kinase activation, intracellular trafficking, and translation (Pickart and Fushman, Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 8: 610-616 (2004); Hicke and Dunn, Annu Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 19: 141-172 (2003); Spece et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 15: 1265-1273 (1995); Ulrich, Eukaryot. Cell 1: 1-10 (2002); Spence et al., Cell 102: 67-76 (2000); Seibenhener et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 24(18): 8055-8068 (2004)). In one specific example, synphilin-1 is normally ubiquitinated with K63-linked polyubiquitin by parkin in a proteasomal-independent manner, but synphilin-1 can alternately be targeted for destruction by ubiquitination with K48-linked polyubiquitin (Lim et al., J. Neurosci. 25(8): 2002-9 (2005)). An analysis of subjects with Parkinson's disease shows that K63-polyubiquitination of synphilin-1 may be involved in the formation of Lewy body inclusions associated with that disease (Lim et al., J. Neurosci. 25(8): 2002-9 (2005)).\n\n\nOther lysine-linked polyubiquitins have not been studied extensively, largely because of the difficulty in distinguishing between them. Studies have thus far relied on cells expressing mutagenized ubiquitins in which one or more lysines have been removed, on enzymatically synthesized polyubiquitins of particular linkages, or on techniques such as mass spectrometry to distinguish between one type of polyubiquitin and another. Each of those methodologies is ill-suited or cumbersome for analysis of the normal physiological behavior of particular lysine-linked polyubiquitins. While antibodies exist that are specific for polyubiquitin as opposed to monoubiquitin (Fujimoro et al., FEBS Lett. 349: 173-180 (1994)), there are as yet no antibodies that can distinguish between polyubiquitins of different lysine linkages.\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, given their important roles in a variety of cellular processes, ubiquitin and polyubiquitins have also been implicated in many diseases (see Argiles, Ubiquitin and Disease, R. G. Landes (1998)). Ubiquitin dysregulation is observed in muscle wasting (Mitch and Goldberg, New Engl. J. Med. 335: 1897-905 (1996); Bodine et al., Science 294: 1704-1708 (2001)). Several genetic diseases have been linked to aberrant ubiquitin activity, including cystic fibrosis (Ward et al., Cell 83: 121-127 (1995)), Angelman's syndrome (Kishino et al., Nature Genet. 15: 70-73 (1997)), and Liddle syndrome (Staub et al., EMBO J. 16: 6325-6336 (1997)). Ubiquitin also plays a role in immune and inflammatory responses; for example, extracellular ubiquitin has been found to act as a sort of cytokine, inhibiting the TNFα response to endotoxin in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and regulating endotoxin hyporesponsiveness (Majetschak et al., Blood 101: 1882-1890 (2003); Ciechanover, EMBO J. 17: 7151-7160 (1998)). Also, both ubiquitin and polyubiquitin have been found in human serum, with higher levels of both molecules observed in the serum of patients having parasitic and allergic disease (Takada et al., Clinical Chem. 43: 1188-1195 (1997)).\n\n\nDysregulation of several ubiquitin-mediated pathways are also involved in cancer (Spataro et al., Br. J. Cancer 77: 448-55 (1998); Beckmann et al., Hum. Mutat. 25: 507-12 (2005)). For example, mutations in the heterodimeric ubiquitin ligase BRCA1-BARD1 are correlated with breast cancer (Hashizume et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276: 14537-40 (2001)), mutations that disrupt the ability of Myc to be degraded by the ubiquitin pathway activate the oncogenic potential of c-Myc (Salghetti et al., EMBO J. 18: 717-726 (1999)), and transformed v-Jun is unable to be ubiquitinated and degraded as its non-oncogenic correlate, c-Jun, is, giving rise to uncontrolled growth (Ciechanover, EMBO J. 17: 7151-7160 (1998); Trier et al., Cell 78: 787-798 (1994)).\n\n\nUbiquitin and polyubiquitin have particularly been studied in the context of neurological diseases (Chung et al., TINS 24(11 Suppl.) S7-S14 (2001)). The inclusions, bodies, and neurofibrillary tangles that accumulate in Huntington's disease, Spinocerebellar ataxia, prion encephalopathies, Pick's disease, Lewy body disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease stain immunopositively for mono and/or polyubiquitin (Alves-Rodrigues et al., Trends Neurosci. 21: 516-520 (1998); Cammarata et al., Neurosci Lett. 156: 96-98 (1993); Kalchman et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271: 19385-94 (1996); Holmberg et al., Human Mol. Genet. 7: 913-918 (1998); Yedidia et al., EMBO J. 20: 5383-91 (2001); Mori et al., Science 235: 1641-44 (1987); Leigh et al., ActaNeuropathol. (Berl.) 79: 61-72 (1989); and Kuzuhara et al., ActaNeuropathologica 75: 345-353 (1988)). Several forms of Parkinson's disease have been linked to mutations in the ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) gene, a deubiquitinase (Leroy et al., Nature 395: 451-452 (1998)), while other forms of Parkinson's have been linked to inactivating mutations in Parkin, an E2-dependent ubiquitin-protein ligase known to interact with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbCH7 and to ubiquitinate synphilin-1 (Shimura et al., Nature Genet. 25: 302-305 (2000), Zhang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 97: 13354-13359 (2000); Lim et al., J. Neurosci. 25(8): 2002-9 (2005)). Both types of mutations result in aberrant proteolytic processing and the inappropriate aggregation of proteins (see McNaught et al., Nature Rev. Neurosci. 2: 589-594 (2001)). UCH-L1 mutations have also been found to segregate with Huntington's disease (Naze et al., Neurosci. Lett. 328: 1: 1-4 (2002)). A mutant form of ubiquitin has been identified in the brains of Alzheimer's patients that is very efficiently incorporated into polyubiquitin chains, but is refractory to deubiquitination once formed, potentially leading to dominant inhibition of the normal cellular proteolytic processing system (Lam et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 97: 9902-9906 (2000)).\n\n\nIt is clear that it would be beneficial not only to have compositions and methods that can distinguish between polyubiquitins of different lysine linkages, but also to have compositions and methods that are effective in targeting and modulating ubiquitin and polyubiquitin-mediated pathways.

H3 side chain within 4.2 Å of diubiquitin, and ubiquitin side chains within 4.2 Å of H3, are shown as sticks. Residues labeled in bold are ubiquitin residues while the other (non-bold) labeled residues are Fab residues. K63 in the acceptor ubiquitin is shown as a sphere. \nFIG. 2B\n depicts a comparison of K63-linked (upper) and K48-linked (lower) diubiquitin structures. In both cases, the lysine acceptor ubiquitin is to the left and the donor ubiquitin is to the right of the figure. The K48-linked diubiquitin forms a more compact shape with the chain extending perpendicular to the ubiquitin dimer as compared to the K63 dimer, where the chain extends in a more elongated manner. \nFIG. 2C\n is a superimposition of the Apu2.16 crystal structure shown in \nFIG. 2A\n superimposed on the crystal structure of Apu3.A8, showing the location of the two changes in L2 (S52R) and H3 (S52T) introduced during the affinity maturation process to create Apu3.A8. \nFIG. 2D\n shows a comparison of the structures of Apu2.16, Apu3.A8 and a variant of humanized 4D5 (pdb 1FVE). The Fv regions of Apu2.16 and Apu3.A8 are shown as tubes and superimposed on the Fv region of the humanized anti-Her2 antibody 4D5 variant. In the top view, the CDR regions are labeled; in the bottom view, the Fv regions are rotated by 90 degrees to show the N-termini. \nFIG. 2E\n depicts the charge complementarity between Apu3.A8 (lower) and diubiquitin (upper). Electrostatic surfaces were calculated with PyMol.

The figure shows the poor binding of the parental Apu2.16 IgG to either immobilized K63-linked di- to heptaubiquitin or immobilized K48-linked di- to heptaubiquitin. The figure also shows the binding of each of the affinity-matured anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies Apu3.A12, Apu3.B3, and Apu3.A8 to immobilized K63-linked di- to heptaubiquitin and the absence of binding to immobilized K48-linked di- to heptaubiquitin.\n\n\n \nFIG. 5\n depicts the results of western blotting experiments described in Example 2. The figure shows that though the parental anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibody Apu2.16 was not able to detect K63-linked ubiquitinated Traf6, the affinity-matured antibodies Apu3.A12, Apu3.B3, and Apu3.A8 were able to specifically detect K63-linked ubiquitinated Traf6 in a western blot format.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 6A-B\n depict the results of a western blotting experiment to assess the ability of various anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies to immunoprecipitate K63-linked Traf6 from cellular lysates, as described in Example 2. The affinity-matured antibodies Apu3.A8, Apu3.B3, and Apu3.A12 were better able to immunoprecipitate K63-linked polyubiquitinated Traf6 than the parental antibody Apu2.16.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 7A-K\n depict the results of confirmatory mass spectrometry experiments, as described in Example 3. \nFIG. 7A\n depicts the results of mass spectrometry experiments to confirm that the proteins immunoprecipitated by affinity-matured antibodies Apu3.A8, Apu3.B3, and Apu3.A12 were mainly K63-linked ubiquitinated, as described in Example 2. \nFIG. 7B\n shows that the K48 linkage was not enriched using this approach, hence showing specificity of the K63 antibody towards the K63 chain linkage. \nFIGS. 7C-F\n show bar graphs of data obtained from immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-K48-linked polyubiquitin antibody Apu2.07, anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibody Apu3.A8, or an isotype control antibody (anti-Her2), followed by mass spectrometric analysis to determine the total amount of ubiquitin immunoprecipitated (\nFIG. 7C\n), as well as the types of polyubiquitin linkages present in the lysate (\nFIG. 7D\n) and antibody-specific immunoprecipitates (anti-K48-linked polyubiquitin in \nFIG. 7E\n; anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin in \nFIG. 7F\n). \nFIG. 7G\n schematically depicts the MuRF1 autoubiquitination reactions performed in vitro with WT, K48R or K63R ubiquitin followed by immunoprecipitation with Apu2.07, Apu3.A8, or an isotype-matched control antibody.

For the purpose of describing this figure only, the blots are assigned sequential numbers from 1 to 7, with the topmost blot having assigned \nnumber\n 1 and the bottom-most blot having assigned \nnumber\n 7. The \nblot\n 6 includes samples that were immunoprecipitated with anti-K48-linked IgG to capture K48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins. The \nblot\n 7 includes samples that were immunoprecipitated with a 1:1 cocktail of Apu3.A8 and Apu3.B3 to capture K63-linked polyubiquitinated proteins. Both blots were stained with an anti-RIP antibody. The blots 1-3 show control western blots to demonstrate that the levels of RIP and tubulin remain relatively constant during TNFα treatment (blots 1 and 3), while IκBα levels decrease upon TNFα treatment (blot 2). \n \nBlots\n \n 4 and 5 show control western blots to demonstrate that RIP is co-precipitated during an immunoprecipitation for TNFR1 (blot 4), and that the levels of TNFR1 remain constant during TNFα treatment (blot 5). \nFIG. 9B\n schematically depicts the cellular pathway by which K63-linked polyubiquitin is added to RIP and replaced with K48-linked polyubiquitin by A20.\n\n\n \nFIG. 10\n shows the results of experiments described in Example 3(B) assessing the polyubiquitination state of IRAK1 after IL-1β stimulation of cells.

Such techniques are explained fully in the literature, such as, “Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual”, third edition (Sambrook et al., 2001); “Oligonucleotide Synthesis” (M. J. Gait, ed., 1984); “Animal Cell Culture” (R. I. Freshney, ed., 1987); “Methods in Enzymology” (Academic Press, Inc.); “Current Protocols in Molecular Biology” (F. M. Ausubel et al., eds., 1987, and periodic updates); “PCR: The Polymerase Chain Reaction”, (Mullis et al., ed., 1994); PCR 2: A Practical Approach (M. J. MacPherson, B. D. Hames and G. R. Taylor eds. (1995)); Harlow and Lane, eds. (1988) Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual; “A Practical Guide to Molecular Cloning” (Perbal Bernard V., 1988); and “Phage Display: A Laboratory Manual” (Barbas et al., 2001).\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms “ubiquitin” and “monoubiquitin” are used interchangeably, and are defined as all species of native human and synthetic ubiquitin substantially similar to a 76-amino acid protein having at least one lysine residue at \namino acid\n 6, \namino acid\n 11, amino acid 27, \namino acid\n 29, \namino acid\n 33, \namino acid\n 48, and/or \namino acid\n 63.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “polyubiquitin” is defined as all species of native human and synthetic polymeric chains of ubiquitin which fall within human and synthetic classes of different polymeric linkages of ubiquitin, including, but not limited to, K6-linked polyubiquitin, K11-linked polyubiquitin, K27-linked polyubiquitin, K29-linked polyubiquitin, K33-linked polyubiquitin, K48-linked polyubiquitin and K63-linked polyubiquitin. Polyubiquitin may be of any length, and includes at least two ubiquitin moieties. Polyubiquitin is distinguished from tandem repeats of ubiquitin that are originally expressed as a single protein.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms “K*-linked polyubiquitin” and “Lys*-linked polyubiquitin” are interchangeable, and refer to a polyubiquitin molecule comprising at least one isopeptide bond between the C-terminus of one ubiquitin moiety and a lysine at position * in another ubiquitin moiety. For example, a “K63-linked polyubiquitin” is used interchangeably with a “Lys63-linked polyubiquitin”, and both terms refer to a polyubiquitin molecule comprising an isopeptide bond between the C-terminus of one of the ubiquitin moieties in the molecule and the lysine at \nposition\n 63 in another ubiquitin moiety in the molecule.\n\n\nAs used herein, a statement that a first lysine linkage “differs” from a second lysine linkage indicates that the first lysine linkage between one ubiquitin moiety and another ubiquitin moiety involves a different lysine residue (e.g., K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and/or K63) than the second lysine linkage between one ubiquitin moiety and another ubiquitin moiety.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “ubiquitin pathway” refers to a biochemical pathway in a cell or reconstituted in vitro that includes ubiquitin and/or polyubiquitin.\n\n\nAn “isolated” antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with research, diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In one embodiment, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by, for example, the Lowry method, and in some embodiments more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of, for example, a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using, for example, Coomassie blue or silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms “anti-ubiquitin antibody” and “anti-monoubiquitin antibody” are used interchangeably, and refer to an antibody that is capable of specifically binding to a ubiquitin molecule.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “anti-polyubiquitin antibody” refers to an antibody that is capable of specifically binding to a polyubiquitin molecule.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “anti-K48-linked polyubiquitin antibody” refers to an antibody that is capable of specifically binding to K48-linked polyubiquitin.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibody” refers to an antibody that is capable of binding to K63-linked polyubiquitin.\n\n\nThe phrase “substantially similar,” “substantially the same”, “equivalent”, or “substantially equivalent”, as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (for example, one associated with a molecule and the other associated with a reference/comparator molecule) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and/or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values, anti-viral effects, etc.). The difference between said two values is, for example, less than about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, and/or less than about 10% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator molecule.\n\n\nThe phrase “substantially reduced,” or “substantially different”, as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values (generally one associated with a molecule and the other associated with a reference/comparator molecule) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is, for example, greater than about 10%, greater than about 20%, greater than about 30%, greater than about 40%, and/or greater than about 50% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator molecule.\n\n\n“Binding affinity” generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, “binding affinity” refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the “Kd” or “Kd value” according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (\n125\nI)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (Chen, et al., (1999) \nJ. Mol Biol \n293:865-881). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 μg/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23° C.). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [\n125\nI]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of an anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., (1997) \nCancer Res. \n57:4593-4599). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., 65 hours) to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 μl/well of scintillant (MicroScint-20; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25° C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at ˜10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 μg/ml (˜0.2 μM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 μl/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. In each experiment, a spot was activated and ethanolamine blocked without immobilizing protein, to be used for reference subtraction. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25° C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 μl/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n. See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al., (1999) \nJ. Mol Biol \n293:865-881. If the on-rate exceeds 10\n6 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nby the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25° C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.\n\n\nAn “on-rate” or “rate of association” or “association rate” or “k\non\n” according to this invention can also be determined with the same surface plasmon resonance technique described above using a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25° C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at ˜10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 μg/ml (˜0.2 μM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 μl/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25° C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 μl/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n. See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al., (1999)\nJ. Mol Biol \n293:865-881. However, if the on-rate exceeds 10\n6 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nby the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25° C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.\n\n\nThe term “vector,” as used herein, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a “plasmid”, which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as “recombinant expression vectors” (or simply, “recombinant vectors”). In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, “plasmid” and “vector” may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector.\n\n\n“Polynucleotide,” or “nucleic acid,” as used interchangeably herein, refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase, or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present, modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after synthesis, such as by conjugation with a label. Other types of modifications include, for example, “caps,” substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, ply-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotides(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid or semi-solid supports. The 5′ and 3′ terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2′-O-methyl-, 2′-O-allyl, 2′-fluoro- or 2′-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, α-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs and basic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(O)S (“thioate”), P(S)S (“dithioate”), “(O)NR\n2 \n(“amidate”), P(O)R, P(O)OR′, CO or CH2 (“formacetal”), in which each R or R′ is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (—O—) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and DNA.\n\n\n“Oligonucleotide,” as used herein, generally refers to short, generally single-stranded, generally synthetic polynucleotides that are generally, but not necessarily, less than about 200 nucleotides in length. The terms “oligonucleotide” and “polynucleotide” are not mutually exclusive. The description above for polynucleotides is equally and fully applicable to oligonucleotides.\n\n\n“Antibodies” (Abs) and “immunoglobulins” (Igs) are glycoproteins having the same structural characteristics. While antibodies exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen, immunoglobulins include both antibodies and other antibody-like molecules which generally lack antigen specificity. Polypeptides of the latter kind are, for example, produced at low levels by the lymph system and at increased levels by myelomas.\n\n\nThe terms “antibody” and “immunoglobulin” are used interchangeably in the broadest sense and include monoclonal antibodies (e.g., full length or intact monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, monovalent, multivalent antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity) and may also include certain antibody fragments (as described in greater detail herein). An antibody can be chimeric, human, humanized and/or affinity matured.\n\n\nThe “variable region” or “variable domain” of an antibody refers to the amino-terminal domains of heavy or light chain of the antibody. These domains are generally the most variable parts of an antibody and contain the antigen-binding sites.\n\n\nThe term “variable” refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions both in the light-chain and the heavy-chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.\n\n\nPapain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called “Fab” fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual “Fc” fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab′)2 fragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.\n\n\n“Fv” is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. In a two-chain Fv species, this region consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv species, one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a “dimeric” structure analogous to that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n\nThe Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab′ fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab′-SH is the designation herein for Fab′ in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab′)2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab′ fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.\n\n\nThe “light chains” of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (κ) and lambda (λ), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.\n\n\nDepending on the amino acid sequences of the constant domains of their heavy chains, antibodies (immunoglobulins) can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, IgG\n4\n, IgA\n1\n, and IgA\n2\n. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called α, δ, ε, γ, and μ, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known and described generally in, for example, Abbas et al. Cellular and Mol. Immunology, 4th ed. (2000). An antibody may be part of a larger fusion molecule, formed by covalent or non-covalent association of the antibody with one or more other proteins or peptides.\n\n\nThe terms “full length antibody,” “intact antibody” and “whole antibody” are used herein interchangeably, to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form, not antibody fragments as defined below. The terms particularly refer to an antibody with heavy chains that contain the Fc region.\n\n\n“Antibody fragments” comprise only a portion of an intact antibody, wherein the portion retains at least one, and as many as most or all, of the functions normally associated with that portion when present in an intact antibody. In one embodiment, an antibody fragment comprises an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen. In another embodiment, an antibody fragment, for example one that comprises the Fc region, retains at least one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region when present in an intact antibody, such as FcRn binding, antibody half life modulation, ADCC function and complement binding. In one embodiment, an antibody fragment is a monovalent antibody that has an in vivo half life substantially similar to an intact antibody. For example, such an antibody fragment may comprise an antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring in vivo stability to the fragment.\n\n\nThe term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus, the modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies. Such monoclonal antibody typically includes an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that binds a target, wherein the target-binding polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that includes the selection of a single target binding polypeptide sequence from a plurality of polypeptide sequences. For example, the selection process can be the selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones, such as a pool of hybridoma clones, phage clones or recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that the selected target binding sequence can be further altered, for example, to improve affinity for the target, to humanize the target binding sequence, to improve its production in cell culture, to reduce its immunogenicity in vivo, to create a multispecific antibody, etc., and that an antibody comprising the altered target binding sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibody preparations are advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including, for example, the hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler et al., Nature, 256: 495 (1975); Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2\nnd \ned. 1988); Hammerling et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981)), recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), phage display technologies (See, e.g., Clackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597 (1992); Sidhu et al., J. Mol.

Methods 284(1-2): 119-132 (2004), and technologies for producing human or human-like antibodies in animals that have parts or all of the human immunoglobulin loci or genes encoding human immunoglobulin sequences (see, e.g., WO98/24893; WO96/34096; WO96/33735; WO91/10741; Jakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., Nature 362: 255-258 (1993); Bruggemann et al., Year in Immunol. 7:33 (1993); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,016; Marks et al., Bio. Technology 10: 779-783 (1992); Lonberg et al., Nature 368: 856-859 (1994); Morrison, Nature 368: 812-813 (1994); Fishwild et al., Nature Biotechnol. 14: 845-851 (1996); Neuberger, Nature Biotechnol. 14: 826 (1996) and Lonberg and Huszar, Intern. Rev. Immunol. 13: 65-93 (1995).\n\n\nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81:6851-6855 (1984)).\n\n\n“Humanized” forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In one embodiment, a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and/or capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al., \nNature \n321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., \nNature \n332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, \nCurr. Op. Struct. Biol. \n2:593-596 (1992).

Transactions \n23:1035-1038 (1995); Hurle and Gross, \nCurr. Op. Biotech. \n5:428-433 (1994).\n\n\nThe term “hypervariable region”, “HVR”, or “HV”, when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or form structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six hypervariable regions; three in the VH (H1, H2, H3), and three in the VL (L1, L2, L3). A number of hypervariable region delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used (Kabat et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops (Chothia and Lesk \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901-917 (1987)). The AbM hypervariable regions represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and Chothia structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling software. The “contact” hypervariable regions are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these hypervariable regions are noted below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop\n\n\nKabat\n\n\nAbM\n\n\nChothia\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL1\n\n\nL24-L34\n\n\nL24-L34\n\n\nL26-L32\n\n\nL30-L36\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL2\n\n\nL50-L56\n\n\nL50-L56\n\n\nL50-L52\n\n\nL46-L55\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL3\n\n\nL89-L97\n\n\nL89-L97\n\n\nL91-L96\n\n\nL89-L96\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1\n\n\nH31-H35B\n\n\nH26-H35B\n\n\nH26-H32\n\n\nH30-H35B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Kabat Numbering)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1\n\n\nH31-H35\n\n\nH26-H35\n\n\nH26-H32\n\n\nH30-H35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Chothia Numbering)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2\n\n\nH50-H65\n\n\nH50-H58\n\n\nH53-H55\n\n\nH47-H58\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH3\n\n\nH95-H102\n\n\nH95-H102\n\n\nH96-H101\n\n\nH93-H101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypervariable regions may comprise “extended hypervariable regions” as follows: 24-36 or 24-34 (L1), 46-56 or 50-56 or 49-56 (L2) and 89-97 or 89-96 (L3) in the VL and 26-35 (H1), 50-65 or 49-65 (H2) and 93-102, 94-102, or 95-102 (H3) in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al., supra, for each of these definitions.\n\n\n“Framework” or “FR” residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.\n\n\nThe term “variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat” or “amino acid position numbering as in Kabat,” and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991). Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a “standard” Kabat numbered sequence.\n\n\n“Single-chain Fv” or “scFv” antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see Pluckthun, in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).\n\n\nThe term “diabodies” refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH-VL). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO93/1161; and Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448 (1993).\n\n\nA “human antibody” is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and/or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues.\n\n\nAn “affinity matured” antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more HVRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). In one embodiment, an affinity matured antibody has nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. \nBio/Technology \n10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and/or framework residues is described by: Barbas et al. \nProc Nat. Acad. Sci. USA \n91:3809-3813 (1994); Schier et al. \nGene \n169:147-155 (1995); Yelton et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n155:1994-2004 (1995); Jackson et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins et al, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n226:889-896 (1992).\n\n\nA “blocking” antibody or an “antagonist” antibody is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. Certain blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen.\n\n\nAn “agonist antibody”, as used herein, is an antibody which mimics at least one of the functional activities of a polypeptide of interest.\n\n\nA “disorder” is any condition that would benefit from treatment with an antibody of the invention. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Non-limiting examples of disorders to be treated herein include cancer, muscular disorders, ubiquitin-pathway-related genetic disorders, immune/inflammatory disorders, neurological disorders, and other ubiquitin pathway-related disorders.\n\n\nThe terms “cell proliferative disorder” and “proliferative disorder” refer to disorders that are associated with some degree of abnormal cell proliferation. In one embodiment, the cell proliferative disorder is cancer.\n\n\n“Tumor,” as used herein, refers to all neoplastic cell growth and proliferation, whether malignant or benign, and all pre-cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues. The terms “cancer,” “cancerous,” “cell proliferative disorder,” “proliferative disorder” and “tumor” are not mutually exclusive as referred to herein.\n\n\nThe terms “cancer” and “cancerous” refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth/proliferation. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma (e.g., Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, leukemia and other lymphoproliferative disorders, and various types of head and neck cancer.\n\n\nThe term “muscular disorder” refers to or describes the physiological condition in muscle-containing animals that is typically characterized by deterioration or weakening of skeletal and/or smooth muscle such that normal muscular function is significantly reduced. Examples of muscular disorders include, but are not limited to, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Isaac's syndrome; stiff-person syndrome; familiar periodic paralyses, myopathy, myotonia, rhabdomyolyses, muscle atrophy, and various types of muscle weakness and muscle rigidity.\n\n\nThe term “ubiquitin pathway-related genetic disorder” refers to or describes a genetically-based disorder that is typically characterized by or contributed to by aberrant functioning of the ubiquitin pathway. Examples of ubiquitin pathway-related genetic disorders include, but are not limited to, cystic fibrosis, Angelman's syndrome, and Liddle syndrome.\n\n\nThe terms “neurological disorder” or “neurological disease” refer to or describe a disease or disorder of the central and/or peripheral nervous system in mammals that is typically characterized by deterioration of nervous tissue or deterioration of communication between cells in nervous tissue. Examples of neurological disorders include, but are not limited to, neurodegenerative diseases (including, but not limited to, Lewy body disease, postpoliomyelitis syndrome, Shy-Draeger syndrome, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, striatonigral degeneration, tauopathies (including, but not limited to, Alzheimer disease and supranuclear palsy), prion diseases (including, but not limited to, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, scrapie, Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome, kuru, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, chronic wasting disease, and fatal familial insomnia), bulbar palsy, motor neuron disease, and nervous system heterodegenerative disorders (including, but not limited to, Canavan disease, Huntington's disease, neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis, Alexander's disease, Tourette's syndrome, Menkes kinky hair syndrome, Cockayne syndrome, Halervorden-Spatz syndrome, lafora disease, Rett syndrome, hepatolenticular degeneration, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, and Unverricht-Lundborg syndrome), dementia (including, but not limited to, Pick's disease, and spinocerebellar ataxia.\n\n\nThe terms “inflammatory disorder” and “immune disorder” refer to or describe disorders caused by aberrant immunologic mechanisms and/or aberrant cytokine signaling. Examples of inflammatory and immune disorders include, but are not limited to, autoimmune diseases, immunologic deficiency syndromes, and hypersensitivity.

In principle, synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage libraries containing phage that display various fragments of antibody variable region (Fv) fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of binding to the desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non-binding clones in the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen, and can be further enriched by additional cycles of antigen adsorption/elution. Any of the anti-polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone of interest followed by construction of a full length anti-polyubiquitin antibody clone using the Fv sequences from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region (Fc) sequences described in Kabat et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest\n, Fifth Edition, NIH Publication 91-3242, Bethesda Md. (1991), vols. 1-3.\n\n\nThe antigen-binding domain of an antibody is formed from two variable (V) regions of about 110 amino acids, one each from the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains, that both present three hypervariable loops or complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Variable domains can be displayed functionally on phage, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments, in which VH and VL are covalently linked through a short, flexible peptide, or as Fab fragments, in which they are each fused to a constant domain and interact non-covalently, as described in Winter et al., \nAnn. Rev. Immunol., \n12: 433-455 (1994). As used herein, scFv encoding phage clones and Fab encoding phage clones are collectively referred to as “Fv phage clones” or “Fv clones”.\n\n\nRepertoires of VH and VL genes can be separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and recombined randomly in phage libraries, which can then be searched for antigen-binding clones as described in Winter et al., \nAnn. Rev. Immunol., \n12: 433-455 (1994). Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive repertoire can be cloned to provide a single source of human antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al., \nEMBO J, \n12: 725-734 (1993). Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning the unrearranged V-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro as described by Hoogenboom and Winter, \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n227: 381-388 (1992).\n\n\nFilamentous phage is used to display antibody fragments by fusion to the minor coat protein pIII. The antibody fragments can be displayed as single chain Fv fragments, in which VH and VL domains are connected on the same polypeptide chain by a flexible polypeptide spacer, e.g. as described by Marks et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n222: 581-597 (1991), or as Fab fragments, in which one chain is fused to pIII and the other is secreted into the bacterial host cell periplasm where assembly of a Fab-coat protein structure which becomes displayed on the phage surface by displacing some of the wild type coat proteins, e.g. as described in Hoogenboom et al., \nNucl. Acids Res., \n19: 4133-4137 (1991).\n\n\nIn general, nucleic acids encoding antibody gene fragments are obtained from immune cells harvested from humans or animals. If a library biased in favor of anti-polyubiquitin clones is desired, the subject is immunized with polyubiquitin to generate an antibody response, and spleen cells and/or circulating B cells or other peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) are recovered for library construction. In one embodiment, a human antibody gene fragment library biased in favor of anti-human polyubiquitin clones is obtained by generating an anti-human polyubiquitin antibody response in transgenic mice carrying a functional human immunoglobulin gene array (and lacking a functional endogenous antibody production system) such that polyubiquitin immunization gives rise to B cells producing human antibodies against polyubiquitin. The generation of human antibody-producing transgenic mice is described in Section (II)(b) below.\n\n\nAdditional enrichment for anti-polyubiquitin reactive cell populations can be obtained by using a suitable screening procedure to isolate B cells expressing polyubiquitin-specific membrane bound antibody, e.g., by cell separation with polyubiquitin affinity chromatography or adsorption of cells to fluorochrome-labeled polyubiquitin followed by flow-activated cell sorting (FACS).\n\n\nAlternatively, the use of spleen cells and/or B cells or other PBLs from an unimmunized donor provides a better representation of the possible antibody repertoire, and also permits the construction of an antibody library using any animal (human or non-human) species in which polyubiquitin is not antigenic. For libraries incorporating in vitro antibody gene construction, stem cells are harvested from the subject to provide nucleic acids encoding unrearranged antibody gene segments. The immune cells of interest can be obtained from a variety of animal species, such as human, mouse, rat, lagomorpha, luprine, canine, feline, porcine, bovine, equine, and avian species, etc.\n\n\nNucleic acid encoding antibody variable gene segments (including VH and VL segments) are recovered from the cells of interest and amplified. In the case of rearranged VH and VL gene libraries, the desired DNA can be obtained by isolating genomic DNA or mRNA from lymphocytes followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers matching the 5′ and 3′ ends of rearranged VH and VL genes as described in Orlandi et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci\n. (\nUSA\n), 86: 3833-3837 (1989), thereby making diverse V gene repertoires for expression. The V genes can be amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA, with back primers at the 5′ end of the exon encoding the mature V-domain and forward primers based within the J-segment as described in Orlandi et al. (1989) and in Ward et al., Nature, 341: 544-546 (1989). However, for amplifying from cDNA, back primers can also be based in the leader exon as described in Jones et al., \nBiotechnol., \n9: 88-89 (1991), and forward primers within the constant region as described in Sastry et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci\n. (\nUSA\n), 86: 5728-5732 (1989). To maximize complementarity, degeneracy can be incorporated in the primers as described in Orlandi et al. (1989) or Sastry et al. (1989). In certain embodiments, the library diversity is maximized by using PCR primers targeted to each V-gene family in order to amplify all available VH and VL arrangements present in the immune cell nucleic acid sample, e.g. as described in the method of Marks et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n222: 581-597 (1991) or as described in the method of Orum et al., \nNucleic Acids Res., \n21: 4491-4498 (1993). For cloning of the amplified DNA into expression vectors, rare restriction sites can be introduced within the PCR primer as a tag at one end as described in Orlandi et al. (1989), or by further PCR amplification with a tagged primer as described in Clackson et al., \nNature, \n352: 624-628 (1991).\n\n\nRepertoires of synthetically rearranged V genes can be derived in vitro from V gene segments. Most of the human VH-gene segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in Tomlinson et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n227: 776-798 (1992)), and mapped (reported in Matsuda et al., \nNature Genet., \n3: 88-94 (1993); these cloned segments (including all the major conformations of the H1 and H2 loop) can be used to generate diverse VH gene repertoires with PCR primers encoding H3 loops of diverse sequence and length as described in Hoogenboom and Winter, \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n227: 381-388 (1992). VH repertoires can also be made with all the sequence diversity focused in a long H3 loop of a single length as described in Barbas et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n89: 4457-4461 (1992). Human Vκ and Vλ segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in Williams and Winter, \nEur. J. Immunol., \n23: 1456-1461 (1993)) and can be used to make synthetic light chain repertoires. Synthetic V gene repertoires, based on a range of VH and VL folds, and L3 and H3 lengths, will encode antibodies of considerable structural diversity. Following amplification of V-gene encoding DNAs, germline V-gene segments can be rearranged in vitro according to the methods of Hoogenboom and Winter, \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n227: 381-388 (1992).\n\n\nRepertoires of antibody fragments can be constructed by combining VH and VL gene repertoires together in several ways. Each repertoire can be created in different vectors, and the vectors recombined in vitro, e.g., as described in Hogrefe et al., \nGene, \n128: 119-126 (1993), or in vivo by combinatorial infection, e.g., the loxP system described in Waterhouse et al., \nNucl. Acids Res., \n21: 2265-2266 (1993). The in vivo recombination approach exploits the two-chain nature of Fab fragments to overcome the limit on library size imposed by \nE. coli \ntransformation efficiency. Naive VH and VL repertoires are cloned separately, one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector. The two libraries are then combined by phage infection of phagemid-containing bacteria so that each cell contains a different combination and the library size is limited only by the number of cells present (about 10\n12 \nclones). Both vectors contain in vivo recombination signals so that the VH and VL genes are recombined onto a single replicon and are co-packaged into phage virions. These huge libraries provide large numbers of diverse antibodies of good affinity (K\nd\n \n−1 \nof about 10\n−8 \nM).\n\n\nAlternatively, the repertoires may be cloned sequentially into the same vector, e.g. as described in Barbas et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n88: 7978-7982 (1991), or assembled together by PCR and then cloned, e.g. as described in Clackson et al., \nNature, \n352: 624-628 (1991). PCR assembly can also be used to join VH and VL DNAs with DNA encoding a flexible peptide spacer to form single chain Fv (scFv) repertoires. In yet another technique, “in cell PCR assembly” is used to combine VH and VL genes within lymphocytes by PCR and then clone repertoires of linked genes as described in Embleton et al., \nNucl. Acids Res., \n20: 3831-3837 (1992).\n\n\nScreening of the libraries can be accomplished by any art-known technique. For example, polyubiquitin can be used to coat the wells of adsorption plates, expressed on host cells affixed to adsorption plates or used in cell sorting, or conjugated to biotin for capture with streptavidin-coated beads, or used in any other art-known method for panning phage display libraries.\n\n\nThe phage library samples are contacted with immobilized polyubiquitin under conditions suitable for binding of at least a portion of the phage particles with the adsorbent. Normally, the conditions, including pH, ionic strength, temperature and the like are selected to mimic physiological conditions. The phages bound to the solid phase are washed and then eluted by acid, e.g. as described in Barbas et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n88: 7978-7982 (1991), or by alkali, e.g. as described in Marks et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n222: 581-597 (1991), or by polyubiquitin antigen competition, e.g. in a procedure similar to the antigen competition method of Clackson et al., \nNature, \n352: 624-628 (1991). Phages can be enriched 20-1,000-fold in a single round of selection. Moreover, the enriched phages can be grown in bacterial culture and subjected to further rounds of selection.\n\n\nThe efficiency of selection depends on many factors, including the kinetics of dissociation during washing, and whether multiple antibody fragments on a single phage can simultaneously engage with antigen. Antibodies with fast dissociation kinetics (and weak binding affinities) can be retained by use of short washes, multivalent phage display and high coating density of antigen in solid phase. The high density not only stabilizes the phage through multivalent interactions, but favors rebinding of phage that has dissociated. The selection of antibodies with slow dissociation kinetics (and good binding affinities) can be promoted by use of long washes and monovalent phage display as described in Bass et al., \nProteins, \n8: 309-314 (1990) and in WO 92/09690, and a low coating density of antigen as described in Marks et al., \nBiotechnol., \n10: 779-783 (1992).\n\n\nIt is possible to select between phage antibodies of different affinities, even with affinities that differ slightly, for polyubiquitin. However, random mutation of a selected antibody (e.g. as performed in some of the affinity maturation techniques described above) is likely to give rise to many mutants, most binding to antigen, and a few with higher affinity. With limiting polyubiquitin, rare high affinity phage could be competed out. To retain all the higher affinity mutants, phages can be incubated with excess biotinylated polyubiquitin, but with the biotinylated polyubiquitin at a concentration of lower molarity than the target molar affinity constant for polyubiquitin. The high affinity-binding phages can then be captured by streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. Such “equilibrium capture” allows the antibodies to be selected according to their affinities of binding, with sensitivity that permits isolation of mutant clones with as little as two-fold higher affinity from a great excess of phages with lower affinity. Conditions used in washing phages bound to a solid phase can also be manipulated to discriminate on the basis of dissociation kinetics.\n\n\nAnti-polyubiquitin clones may be activity selected. In one embodiment, the invention provides anti-polyubiquitin antibodies that block the binding between a polyubiquitin ligand and polyubiquitin, but do not block the binding between a polyubiquitin ligand and a second protein. Fv clones corresponding to such anti-polyubiquitin antibodies can be selected by (1) isolating anti-polyubiquitin clones from a phage library as described in Section B(I)(2) above, and optionally amplifying the isolated population of phage clones by growing up the population in a suitable bacterial host; (2) selecting polyubiquitin and a second protein against which blocking and non-blocking activity, respectively, is desired; (3) adsorbing the anti-polyubiquitin phage clones to immobilized polyubiquitin; (4) using an excess of the second protein to elute any undesired clones that recognize polyubiquitin-binding determinants which overlap or are shared with the binding determinants of the second protein; and (5) eluting the clones which remain adsorbed following step (4). Optionally, clones with the desired blocking/non-blocking properties can be further enriched by repeating the selection procedures described herein one or more times.\n\n\nDNA encoding the Fv clones of the invention is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. by using oligonucleotide primers designed to specifically amplify the heavy and light chain coding regions of interest from hybridoma or phage DNA template). Once isolated, the DNA can be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as \nE. coli \ncells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of the desired monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of antibody-encoding DNA include Skerra et al., \nCurr. Opinion in Immunol., \n5: 256 (1993) and Pluckthun, \nImmunol. Revs, \n130: 151 (1992).\n\n\nDNA encoding the Fv clones of the invention can be combined with known DNA sequences encoding heavy chain and/or light chain constant regions (e.g. the appropriate DNA sequences can be obtained from Kabat et al., supra) to form clones encoding full or partial length heavy and/or light chains. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE constant regions, and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species. A Fv clone derived from the variable domain DNA of one animal (such as human) species and then fused to constant region DNA of another animal species to form coding sequence(s) for “hybrid”, full length heavy chain and/or light chain is included in the definition of “chimeric” and “hybrid” antibody as used herein. In one embodiment, a Fv clone derived from human variable DNA is fused to human constant region DNA to form coding sequence(s) for all human, full or partial length heavy and/or light chains.\n\n\nThe antibodies produced by naive libraries (either natural or synthetic) can be of moderate affinity (K\nd\n \n−1 \nof about 10\n6 \nto 10\n7 \nM\n−1\n), but affinity maturation can also be mimicked in vitro by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries as described in Winter et al. (1994), supra. For example, mutation can be introduced at random in vitro by using error-prone polymerase (reported in Leung et al., \nTechnique, \n1: 11-15 (1989)) in the method of Hawkins et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n226: 889-896 (1992) or in the method of Gram et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n89: 3576-3580 (1992). Additionally, affinity maturation can be performed by randomly mutating one or more CDRs, e.g. using PCR with primers carrying random sequence spanning the CDR of interest, in selected individual Fv clones and screening for higher affinity clones. WO 9607754 (published 14 Mar. 1996) described a method for inducing mutagenesis in a complementarity determining region of an immunoglobulin light chain to create a library of light chain genes. Another effective approach is to recombine the VH or VL domains selected by phage display with repertoires of naturally occurring V domain variants obtained from unimmunized donors and screen for higher affinity in several rounds of chain reshuffling as described in Marks et al., \nBiotechnol., \n10: 779-783 (1992). This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the 10\n−9 \nM range.\n\n\nOther Methods of Generating Anti-Polyubiquitin Antibodies\n\n\nOther methods of generating and assessing the affinity of antibodies are well known in the art and are described, e.g., in Kohler et al., Nature 256: 495 (1975); U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986; Kozbor, \nJ. Immunol., \n133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., \nMonoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications\n, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987; Munson et al., \nAnal. Biochem., \n107:220 (1980); Engels et al., \nAgnew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., \n28: 716-734 (1989); Abrahmsen et al., \nEMBO J., \n4: 3901 (1985); \nMethods in Enzymology\n, vol. 44 (1976); Morrison et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n81: 6851-6855 (1984).\n\n\nGeneral Methods\n\n\nIn general, the invention provides affinity-matured anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies. These antibodies have increased affinity and specificity for K63-linked polyubiquitin relative to the antibodies described in US Patent Publication No. US2007-0218069, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The best anti-K63-linked Fab identified in that publication (Apu2.16) has a Kd of approximately 100 nM and a small amount of artifactual binding to K48-linked polyubiquitin. The improved Fabs and antibodies provided herein are affinity-matured versions of Apu2.16, and the best binders (see, for example, the Fabs Apu3.A8, Apu3.A12, and Apu3.B3 and antibody versions thereof) have a greater than ten-fold increase in affinity over Apu2.16 for K63-linked polyubiquitin and negligible binding to K48-linked polyubiquitin. This increase in affinity and sensitivity permits the molecules of the invention to be used for applications and methods that are benefited by (a) the increased sensitivity of the molecules of the invention and/or (b) the tight binding of K63-linked polyubiquitin by the molecules of the invention and/or (c) the increased specificity of the molecules of the invention for K63-linked polyubiquitin relative to K48-linked polyubiquitin, relative to the parental molecule Apu2.16.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the invention provides anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies that are useful for treatment of K63-linked polyubiquitin-mediated disorders in which a partial or total blockade of one or more K63-linked polyubiquitin activities is desired. In one embodiment, the anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention are used to treat cancer. In another embodiment, the anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies provided herein are used to treat muscular disorders, such as those indicated above. In another embodiment, the anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies provided herein are used to treat neurological disorders, such as those indicated above. In another embodiment, the anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies provided herein are used to treat genetic disease. In another embodiment, the anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies provided herein are used to treat immune/inflammatory disorders.\n\n\nThe unique properties of the anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention make them particularly useful for distinguishing between different lysine-linked forms of polyubiquitin in a cellular system without resorting to cumbersome and expensive genetic manipulation or biophysical methods such as mass spectrometry. The anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can be used to characterize the function(s) and activities of K63-linked polyubiquitins both in vitro and in vivo. For example, as shown herein, both RIP and IRAK1 are modulated in function and activity by alternative tagging with either K48-linked or K63-linked polyubiquitin due to TNFα or IL-1β stimulation, respectively. The anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention permit the sensitive and specific detection of the K63-ubiquitinated versions of, e.g., RIP and/or IRAK in straightforward and routine biomolecular assays such as immunoprecipitations, ELISAs, or immunomicroscopy without the need for mass spectrometry or genetic manipulation. In turn, this provides a significant advantage in both observing and elucidating the normal functioning of these pathways and in detecting when the pathways are functioning aberrantly.\n\n\nThe anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can also be used to determine the role of specific lysine-linked polyubiquitins in the development and pathogenesis of disease. For example, as described above, the anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can be used to determine whether RIP or IRAK1 are aberrantly K63-polyubiquitinated, which in turn provides information about the normal or aberrant functioning of TNFα or IL-1β signaling, which can be correlated with one or more disease states.\n\n\nThe anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can further be used to treat diseases in which one or more K63-linked polyubiquitins are aberrantly regulated or aberrantly functioning without interfering with the normal activity of polyubiquitins for which the anti-polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention are not specific.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention find utility as reagents for detection and isolation of K63-linked polyubiquitin, such as detection of K63-linked polyubiquitin in various cell types and tissues, including the determination of K63-linked polyubiquitin density and distribution in cell populations and within a given cell, and cell sorting based on the presence or amount of K63-linked polyubiquitin. The antibodies of the invention are able to specifically bind not only to isolated K63-linked polyubiquitin of various chain lengths, but also to proteins which have been polyubiquitinated with K63-linked polyubiquitin, and thus detection and binding to either free (i.e. unconjugated to a heterologous protein) or K63-linked polyubiquitinated protein (i.e., conjugated to a heterologous protein) and/or both is contemplated herein.\n\n\nIn yet another aspect, the present anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies are useful for the development of polyubiquitin antagonists with blocking activity patterns similar to those of the subject antibodies of the invention. For example, anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can be used to determine and identify other antibodies that have the same K63-linked polyubiquitin binding characteristics and/or capabilities of blocking K63-linked polyubiquitin-mediated pathways.\n\n\nAs a further example, anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can be used to identify other anti-polyubiquitin antibodies that bind substantially the same antigenic determinant(s) of K63-linked polyubiquitin as the antibodies exemplified herein, including linear and conformational epitopes.\n\n\nThe anti-polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can be used in assays based on the physiological pathways in which K63-linked polyubiquitin is involved to screen for small molecule antagonists of K63-linked polyubiquitin which will exhibit similar pharmacological effects in blocking the binding of one or more binding partners to K63-linked polyubiquitin as the antibody does. For example, K63-linked polyubiquitin is known to be involved in DNA repair (see, e.g., Pickart and Fushman, Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 8: 610-616 (2004)), and thus the activity of anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies to antagonize a DNA repair pathway may be compared to the activity of one or more potential small molecule antagonists of K63-linked polyubiquitin in that same DNA repair pathway. Similarly, in another example, K63-linked polyubiquitin is known to be involved in formation of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (see, e.g., Lim et al., J. Neurosci. 25(8): 2002-9 (2005)), and thus the activity of anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies to antagonize the formation of Lewy bodies may be compared to the activity of one or more potential small molecule antagonists of K63-linked polyubiquitin in antagonizing the formation of Lewy bodies.\n\n\nGeneration of antibodies can be achieved using routine skills in the art, including those described herein, such as the hybridoma technique and screening of phage displayed libraries of binder molecules. These methods are well-established in the art.\n\n\nBriefly, the anti-polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can be made by using combinatorial libraries to screen for synthetic antibody clones with the desired activity or activities. In principle, synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage libraries containing phage that display various fragments of antibody variable region (Fv) fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of binding to the desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non-binding clones in the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen, and can be further enriched by additional cycles of antigen adsorption/elution. Any of the anti-polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone of interest followed by construction of a full length anti-polyubiquitin antibody clone using the Fv sequences from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region (Fc) sequences described in Kabat et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest\n, Fifth Edition, NIH Publication 91-3242, Bethesda Md. (1991), vols. 1-3. See also PCT Pub. WO03/102157, and references cited therein.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, anti-polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention are monoclonal. Also encompassed within the scope of the invention are antibody fragments such as Fab, Fab′, Fab′-SH and F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments, and variations thereof, of the anti-polyubiquitin antibodies provided herein. These antibody fragments can be created by traditional means, such as enzymatic digestion, or may be generated by recombinant techniques. Such antibody fragments may be chimeric, human or humanized. These fragments are useful for the experimental, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes set forth herein.\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies can be obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus, the modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies.\n\n\nThe anti-polyubiquitin monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made using a variety of methods known in the art, including the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., \nNature, \n256:495 (1975), or alternatively they may be made by recombinant DNA methods (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567).\n\n\nVectors, Host Cells and Recombinant Methods\n\n\nFor recombinant production of an antibody of the invention, the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The choice of vector depends in part on the host cell to be used. Host cells include, but are not limited to, cells of either prokaryotic or eukaryotic (generally mammalian) origin. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE constant regions, and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species.\n\n\nGenerating Antibodies Using Prokaryotic Host Cells\n\n\nVector Construction\n\n\nPolynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide components of the antibody of the invention can be obtained using standard recombinant techniques. Desired polynucleotide sequences may be isolated and sequenced from antibody producing cells such as hybridoma cells. Alternatively, polynucleotides can be synthesized using nucleotide synthesizer or PCR techniques. Once obtained, sequences encoding the polypeptides are inserted into a recombinant vector capable of replicating and expressing heterologous polynucleotides in prokaryotic hosts. Many vectors that are available and known in the art can be used for the purpose of the present invention. Selection of an appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acids to be inserted into the vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various components, depending on its function (amplification or expression of heterologous polynucleotide, or both) and its compatibility with the particular host cell in which it resides. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to: an origin of replication, a selection marker gene, a promoter, a ribosome binding site (RBS), a signal sequence, the heterologous nucleic acid insert and a transcription termination sequence.\n\n\nIn general, plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example, \nE. coli \nis typically transformed using pBR322, a plasmid derived from an \nE. coli \nspecies. pBR322 contains genes encoding ampicillin (Amp) and tetracycline (Tet) resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells. pBR322, its derivatives, or other microbial plasmids or bacteriophage may also contain, or be modified to contain, promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for expression of endogenous proteins. Examples of pBR322 derivatives used for expression of particular antibodies are described in detail in Carter et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,237.\n\n\nIn addition, phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For example, bacteriophage such as λGEM™-11 may be utilized in making a recombinant vector which can be used to transform susceptible host cells such as \nE. coli \nLE392.\n\n\nThe expression vector of the invention may comprise two or more promoter-cistron pairs, encoding each of the polypeptide components. A promoter is an untranslated regulatory sequence located upstream (5′) to a cistron that modulates its expression. Prokaryotic promoters typically fall into two classes, inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoter is a promoter that initiates increased levels of transcription of the cistron under its control in response to changes in the culture condition, e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.\n\n\nA large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. The selected promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding the light or heavy chain by removing the promoter from the source DNA via restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the isolated promoter sequence into the vector of the invention. Both the native promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and/or expression of the target genes. In some embodiments, heterologous promoters are utilized, as they generally permit greater transcription and higher yields of expressed target gene as compared to the native target polypeptide promoter.\n\n\nPromoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the PhoA promoter, the β-galactamase and lactose promoter systems, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac or the trc promoter. However, other promoters that are functional in bacteria (such as other known bacterial or phage promoters) are suitable as well. Their nucleotide sequences have been published, thereby enabling a skilled worker operably to ligate them to cistrons encoding the target light and heavy chains (Siebenlist et al. (1980) Cell 20: 269) using linkers or adaptors to supply any required restriction sites.\n\n\nIn one aspect of the invention, each cistron within the recombinant vector comprises a secretion signal sequence component that directs translocation of the expressed polypeptides across a membrane. In general, the signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it may be a part of the target polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence selected for the purpose of this invention should be one that is recognized and processed (i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the signal sequences native to the heterologous polypeptides, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group consisting of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, Ipp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II (STII) leaders, LamB, PhoE, PelB, OmpA and MBP. In one embodiment of the invention, the signal sequences used in both cistrons of the expression system are STII signal sequences or variants thereof.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the production of the immunoglobulins according to the invention can occur in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and therefore does not require the presence of secretion signal sequences within each cistron. In that regard, immunoglobulin light and heavy chains are expressed, folded and assembled to form functional immunoglobulins within the cytoplasm. Certain host strains (e.g., the \nE. coli \ntrxB\n−\n strains) provide cytoplasm conditions that are favorable for disulfide bond formation, thereby permitting proper folding and assembly of expressed protein subunits. Proba and Pluckthun \nGene, \n159:203 (1995).\n\n\nAntibodies of the invention can also be produced by using an expression system in which the quantitative ratio of expressed polypeptide components can be modulated in order to maximize the yield of secreted and properly assembled antibodies of the invention. Such modulation is accomplished at least in part by simultaneously modulating translational strengths for the polypeptide components.\n\n\nOne technique for modulating translational strength is disclosed in Simmons et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,523. It utilizes variants of the translational initiation region (TIR) within a cistron. For a given TIR, a series of amino acid or nucleic acid sequence variants can be created with a range of translational strengths, thereby providing a convenient means by which to adjust this factor for the desired expression level of the specific chain. TIR variants can be generated by conventional mutagenesis techniques that result in codon changes which can alter the amino acid sequence. In certain embodiments, changes in the nucleotide sequence are silent. Alterations in the TIR can include, for example, alterations in the number or spacing of Shine-Dalgarno sequences, along with alterations in the signal sequence. One method for generating mutant signal sequences is the generation of a “codon bank” at the beginning of a coding sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence of the signal sequence (i.e., the changes are silent). This can be accomplished by changing the third nucleotide position of each codon; additionally, some amino acids, such as leucine, serine, and arginine, have multiple first and second positions that can add complexity in making the bank. This method of mutagenesis is described in detail in Yansura et al. (1992) \nMETHODS: A Companion to Methods in Enzymol. \n4:151-158.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a set of vectors is generated with a range of TIR strengths for each cistron therein. This limited set provides a comparison of expression levels of each chain as well as the yield of the desired antibody products under various TIR strength combinations. TIR strengths can be determined by quantifying the expression level of a reporter gene as described in detail in Simmons et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,523. Based on the translational strength comparison, the desired individual TIRs are selected to be combined in the expression vector constructs of the invention.\n\n\nProkaryotic host cells suitable for expressing antibodies of the invention include Archaebacteria and Eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms. Examples of useful bacteria include \nEscherichia \n(e.g., \nE. coli\n), Bacilli (e.g., \nB. subtilis\n), Enterobacteria, \nPseudomonas \nspecies (e.g., \nP. aeruginosa\n), \nSalmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescans, Klebsiella, Proteus, Shigella, Rhizobia, Vitreoscilla\n, or \nParacoccus\n. In one embodiment, gram-negative cells are used. In one embodiment, \nE. coli \ncells are used as hosts for the invention. Examples of \nE. coli \nstrains include strain W3110 (Bachmann, \nCellular and Molecular Biology\n, vol. 2 (Washington, D.C.: American Society for Microbiology, 1987), pp. 1190-1219; ATCC Deposit No. 27,325) and derivatives thereof, including strain 33D3 having genotype W3110 ΔfhuA (ΔtonA) ptr3 lac Iq lacL8 ΔompTΔ(nmpc-fepE) degP41 kan\nR \n(U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,635). Other strains and derivatives thereof, such as \nE. coli \n294 (ATCC 31,446), \nE. coli \nB, \nE. coli\n \nλ\n1776 (ATCC 31,537) and \nE. coli \nRV308 (ATCC 31,608) are also suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Methods for constructing derivatives of any of the above-mentioned bacteria having defined genotypes are known in the art and described in, for example, Bass et al., \nProteins, \n8:309-314 (1990). It is generally necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration replicability of the replicon in the cells of a bacterium. For example, \nE. coli, Serratia\n, or \nSalmonella \nspecies can be suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such as pBR322, pBR325, pACYC177, or pKN410 are used to supply the replicon. Typically the host cell should secrete minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes, and additional protease inhibitors may desirably be incorporated in the cell culture.\n\n\nAntibody Production\n\n\nHost cells are transformed with the above-described expression vectors and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\nTransformation means introducing DNA into the prokaryotic host so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride is generally used for bacterial cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers. Another method for transformation employs polyethylene glycol/DMSO. Yet another technique used is electroporation.\n\n\nProkaryotic cells used to produce the polypeptides of the invention are grown in media known in the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells. Examples of suitable media include luria broth (LB) plus necessary nutrient supplements. In some embodiments, the media also contains a selection agent, chosen based on the construction of the expression vector, to selectively permit growth of prokaryotic cells containing the expression vector. For example, ampicillin is added to media for growth of cells expressing ampicillin resistant gene.\n\n\nAny necessary supplements besides carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic phosphate sources may also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. Optionally the culture medium may contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione, cysteine, cystamine, thioglycollate, dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol.\n\n\nThe prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures. For \nE. coli \ngrowth, for example, growth occurs at a temperature range including, but not limited to, about 20° C. to about 39° C., about 25° C. to about 37° C., and at about 30° C. The pH of the medium may be any pH ranging from about 5 to about 9, depending mainly on the host organism. For \nE. coli\n, the pH can be from about 6.8 to about 7.4, or about 7.0.\n\n\nIf an inducible promoter is used in the expression vector of the invention, protein expression is induced under conditions suitable for the activation of the promoter. In one aspect of the invention, PhoA promoters are used for controlling transcription of the polypeptides. Accordingly, the transformed host cells are cultured in a phosphate-limiting medium for induction. In one embodiment, the phosphate-limiting medium is the C.R.A.P medium (see, e.g., Simmons et al., \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n(2002), 263:133-147). A variety of other inducers may be used, according to the vector construct employed, as is known in the art.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the expressed polypeptides of the present invention are secreted into and recovered from the periplasm of the host cells. Protein recovery typically involves disrupting the microorganism, generally by such means as osmotic shock, sonication or lysis. Once cells are disrupted, cell debris or whole cells may be removed by centrifugation or filtration. The proteins may be further purified, for example, by affinity resin chromatography. Alternatively, proteins can be transported into the culture media and isolated therein. Cells may be removed from the culture and the culture supernatant being filtered and concentrated for further purification of the proteins produced. The expressed polypeptides can be further isolated and identified using commonly known methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blot assay.\n\n\nIn one aspect of the invention, antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a fermentation process. Various large-scale fed-batch fermentation procedures are available for production of recombinant proteins. Large-scale fermentations have at least 1000 liters of capacity, for example about 1,000 to 100,000 liters of capacity. These fermentors use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients, especially glucose (a common carbon/energy source). Small scale fermentation refers generally to fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity, and can range from about 1 liter to about 100 liters.\n\n\nIn a fermentation process, induction of protein expression is typically initiated after the cells have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density, e.g., an OD\n550 \nof about 180-220, at which stage the cells are in the early stationary phase. A variety of inducers may be used, according to the vector construct employed, as is known in the art and described above. Cells may be grown for shorter periods prior to induction. Cells are usually induced for about 12-50 hours, although longer or shorter induction time may be used.\n\n\nTo improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention, various fermentation conditions can be modified. For example, to improve the proper assembly and folding of the secreted antibody polypeptides, additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins, such as Dsb proteins (DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, DsbD and or DsbG) or FkpA (a peptidylprolyl cis,trans-isomerase with chaperone activity) can be used to co-transform the host prokaryotic cells. The chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells. Chen et al. (1999) \nJ Bio Chem \n274:19601-19605; Georgiou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,083,715; Georgiou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,027,888; Bothmann and Pluckthun (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275:17100-17105; Ramm and Pluckthun (2000) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n275:17106-17113; Arie et al. (2001) \nMol. Microbiol. \n39:199-210.\n\n\nTo minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins (especially those that are proteolytically sensitive), certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the present invention. For example, host cell strains may be modified to effect genetic mutation(s) in the genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III, OmpT, DegP, Tsp, Protease I, Protease Mi, Protease V, Protease VI and combinations thereof. Some \nE. coli \nprotease-deficient strains are available and described in, for example, Joly et al. (1998), supra; Georgiou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,365; Georgiou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,508,192; Hara et al., \nMicrobial Drug Resistance, \n2:63-72 (1996).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, \nE. coli \nstrains deficient for proteolytic enzymes and transformed with plasmids overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins are used as host cells in the expression system of the invention.\n\n\nAntibody Purification\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the antibody protein produced herein is further purified to obtain preparations that are substantially homogeneous for further assays and uses. Standard protein purification methods known in the art can be employed. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures: fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns, ethanol precipitation, reverse phase HPLC, chromatography on silica or on a cation-exchange resin such as DEAE, chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75.\n\n\nIn one aspect, Protein A immobilized on a solid phase is used for immunoaffinity purification of the antibody products of the invention. Protein A is a 41 kD cell wall protein from \nStaphylococcus aureas \nwhich binds with a high affinity to the Fc region of antibodies. Lindmark et al (1983) \nJ. Immunol. Meth. \n62:1-13. The solid phase to which Protein A is immobilized can be a column comprising a glass or silica surface, or a controlled pore glass column or a silicic acid column. In some applications, the column is coated with a reagent, such as glycerol, to possibly prevent nonspecific adherence of contaminants.\n\n\nAs the first step of purification, the preparation derived from the cell culture as described above can be applied onto a Protein A immobilized solid phase to allow specific binding of the antibody of interest to Protein A. The solid phase would then be washed to remove contaminants non-specifically bound to the solid phase. Finally the antibody of interest is recovered from the solid phase by elution.\n\n\nGenerating Antibodies Using Eukaryotic Host Cells\n\n\nThe vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.\n\n\n(i) Signal Sequence Component\n\n\nA vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell may also contain a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide of interest. The heterologous signal sequence selected generally is one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available.\n\n\nThe DNA for such precursor region is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the antibody.\n\n\n(ii) Origin of Replication\n\n\nGenerally, an origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors. For example, the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter.\n\n\n(iii) Selection Gene Component\n\n\nExpression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, where relevant, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media.\n\n\nOne example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.\n\n\nAnother example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody nucleic acid, such as DHFR, thymidine kinase, metallothionein-I and -II (e.g., primate metallothionein genes), adenosine deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, etc.\n\n\nFor example, cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene may first be identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive antagonist of DHFR. Appropriate host cells when wild-type DHFR is employed include, for example, the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in DHFR activity (e.g., ATCC CRL-9096).\n\n\nAlternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR) transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody, wild-type DHFR protein, and another selectable marker such as \naminoglycoside\n 3′-phosphotransferase (APH) can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin, neomycin, or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,199.\n\n\n(iv) Promoter Component\n\n\nExpression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of interest (e.g., an antibody). Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3′ end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3′ end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.\n\n\nAntibody polypeptide transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells can be controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, or from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.\n\n\nThe early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,601,978. See also Reyes et al., \nNature \n297:598-601 (1982) on expression of human β-interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively, the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.\n\n\n(v) Enhancer Element Component\n\n\nTranscription of DNA encoding an antibody polypeptide of the invention by higher eukaryotes can often be increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, α-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv, \nNature \n297:17-18 (1982) on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a \nposition\n 5′ or 3′ to the antibody polypeptide-encoding sequence, but is generally located at a \nsite\n 5′ from the promoter.\n\n\n(vi) Transcription Termination Component\n\n\nExpression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells will typically also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5′ and, occasionally 3′, untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding an antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94/11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.\n\n\n(vii) Selection and Transformation of Host Cells\n\n\nSuitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include higher eukaryote cells described herein, including vertebrate host cells. Propagation of vertebrate cells in culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., \nJ. Gen Virol. \n36:59 (1977)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/-DHFR (CHO, Urlaub et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n77:4216 (1980)); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, \nBiol. Reprod. \n23:243-251 (1980)); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TRI cells (Mather et al., \nAnnals N.Y. Acad. Sci. \n383:44-68 (1982)); \nMRC\n 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma line (Hep G2).\n\n\nHost cells are transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n(viii) Culturing the Host Cells\n\n\nThe host cells used to produce an antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in Ham et al., \nMeth. Enz. \n58:44 (1979), Barnes et al., \nAnal. Biochem. \n102:255 (1980), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762; 4,560,655; or 5,122,469; WO 90/03430; WO 87/00195; or U.S. Pat. Re. 30,985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN™ drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\n(ix) Purification of Antibody\n\n\nWhen using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, are generally removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.\n\n\nThe antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being a generally acceptable purification technique. The suitability of affinity reagents such as protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human γ1, γ2, or γ4 heavy chains (Lindmark et al., \nJ. Immunol. Meth. \n62:1-13 (1983)). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human γ3 (Guss et al., \nEMBO J. \n5:15671575 (1986)). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain, the Bakerbond ABX™ resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE™ chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.\n\n\nFollowing any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to further purification steps, as necessary, for example by low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, generally performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25M salt).\n\n\nIt should be noted that, in general, techniques and methodologies for preparing antibodies for use in research, testing and clinical use are well-established in the art, consistent with the above and/or as deemed appropriate by one skilled in the art for the particular antibody of interest.\n\n\nActivity Assays\n\n\nAntibodies of the invention can be characterized for their physical/chemical properties and biological functions by various assays known in the art.\n\n\nPurified antibodies can be further characterized by a series of assays including, but not limited to, N-terminal sequencing, amino acid analysis, non-denaturing size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry, ion exchange chromatography and papain digestion.\n\n\nWhere necessary, antibodies are analyzed for their biological activity. In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention are tested for their antigen binding activity. The antigen binding assays that are known in the art and can be used herein include without limitation any direct or competitive binding assays using techniques such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), “sandwich” immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, fluorescent immunoassays, and protein A immunoassays.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the invention contemplates an altered antibody that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desirable candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions (such as complement and ADCC) are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments, the Fc activities of the antibody are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks FcγR binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcγRIII only, whereas monocytes express FcγRI, FcγRII and FcγRIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, \nAnnu. Rev. Immunol \n9:457-92 (1991). An example of an in vitro assay to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 or U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. \nPNAS \n(\nUSA\n) 95:652-656 (1998). C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n202:163 (1996), may be performed. FcRn binding and in vivo clearance/half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art.\n\n\nAntibody Fragments\n\n\nThe present invention encompasses antibody fragments. In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments, rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance, and may lead to improved access to solid tumors.\n\n\nVarious techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24:107-117 (1992); and Brennan et al., Science, 229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab, Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from \nE. coli\n, thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab′-SH fragments can be directly recovered from \nE. coli \nand chemically coupled to form F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments (Carter et al., Bio/Technology 10: 163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment with increased in vivo half-life comprising salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). See WO 93/16185; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,894; and 5,587,458. Fv and sFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions; thus, they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. sFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an sFv. See Antibody Engineering, ed. Borrebaeck, supra. The antibody fragment may also be a “linear antibody”, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.\n\n\nHumanized Antibodies\n\n\nThe invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are known in the art. For example, a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as “import” residues, which are typically taken from an “import” variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al. (1986) \nNature \n321:522-525; Riechmann et al. (1988) \nNature \n332:323-327; Verhoeyen et al. (1988) \nScience \n239:1534-1536), by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such “humanized” antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.\n\n\nThe choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies can be important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called “best-fit” method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody (Sims et al. (1993) \nJ. Immunol. \n151:2296; Chothia et al. (1987) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901. Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al. (1992) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n89:4285; Presta et al. (1993) \nJ. Immunol., \n151:2623.\n\n\nIt is further generally desirable that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to one method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.\n\n\nHuman Antibodies\n\n\nHuman anti-polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can be constructed by combining Fv clone variable domain sequence(s) selected from human-derived phage display libraries with known human constant domain sequences(s) as described above. Alternatively, human monoclonal anti-polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can be made by the hybridoma method. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described, for example, by Kozbor \nJ. Immunol., \n133: 3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., \nMonoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications\n, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987); and Boerner et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n147: 86 (1991).\n\n\nIt is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g. mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (JH) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n90: 2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., \nNature, \n362: 255 (1993); Bruggermann et al., \nYear in Immunol., \n7: 33 (1993).\n\n\nGene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from non-human, e.g. rodent, antibodies, where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting non-human antibody. According to this method, which is also called “epitope imprinting”, either the heavy or light chain variable region of a non-human antibody fragment obtained by phage display techniques as described above is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes, creating a population of non-human chain/human chain scFv or Fab chimeras. Selection with antigen results in isolation of a non-human chain/human chain chimeric scFv or Fab wherein the human chain restores the antigen binding site destroyed upon removal of the corresponding non-human chain in the primary phage display clone, i.e. the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of the human chain partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining non-human chain, a human antibody is obtained (see PCT WO 93/06213 published Apr. 1, 1993). Unlike traditional humanization of non-human antibodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human antibodies, which have no FR or CDR residues of non-human origin.\n\n\nBispecific Antibodies\n\n\nBispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In certain embodiments, bispecific antibodies are human or humanized antibodies. In certain embodiments, one of the binding specificities is for polyubiquitin including a specific lysine linkage and the other is for any other antigen. In certain embodiments, bispecific antibodies may bind to two different polyubiquitins having two different lysine linkages. Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab′)\n2 \nbispecific antibodies).\n\n\nMethods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities (Milstein and Cuello, \nNature, \n305: 537 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829 published May 13, 1993, and in Traunecker et al., \nEMBO J., \n10: 3655 (1991).\n\n\nAccording to a different embodiment, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion, for example, is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. In certain embodiments, the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1), containing the site necessary for light chain binding, is present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94/04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., \nMethods in Enzymology, \n121:210 (1986).\n\n\nAccording to another approach, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The interface comprises at least a part of the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory “cavities” of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.\n\n\nBispecific antibodies include cross-linked or “heteroconjugate” antibodies. For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (WO 91/00360, WO 92/00373, and EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.\n\n\nTechniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., \nScience, \n229: 81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab′ fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab′-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab′-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab′-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.\n\n\nRecent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab′-SH fragments from \nE. coli\n, which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., \nJ. Exp. Med., \n175: 217-225 (1992) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecule. Each Fab′ fragment was separately secreted from \nE. coli \nand subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.\n\n\nVarious techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n148(5):1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab′ portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The “diabody” technology described by Hollinger et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n152:5368 (1994).\n\n\nAntibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n147: 60 (1991).\n\n\nMultivalent Antibodies\n\n\nA multivalent antibody may be internalized (and/or catabolized) faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies (which are other than of the IgM class) with three or more antigen binding sites (e.g. tetravalent antibodies), which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. The dimerization domain comprises (or consists of), for example, an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario, the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino-terminal to the Fc region. In one embodiment, a multivalent antibody comprises (or consists of), for example, three to about eight, or four antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain (for example, two polypeptide chains), wherein the polypeptide chain(s) comprise two or more variable domains. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise VD1-(X1)n-VD2-(X2)n-Fc, wherein VD1 is a first variable domain, VD2 is a second variable domain, Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region, X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide, and n is 0 or 1. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise: VH-CH1-flexible linker-VH-CH1-Fc region chain; or VH-CH1-VH-CH1-Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein may further comprise at least two (for example, four) light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may, for instance, comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and, optionally, further comprise a CL domain. Antibody Variants\n\n\nIn some embodiments, amino acid sequence modification(s) of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody nucleic acid, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.\n\n\nA useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called “alanine scanning mutagenesis” as described by Cunningham and Wells (1989) \nScience, \n244:1081-1085. Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (e.g., alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.\n\n\nAmino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme (e.g. for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.\n\n\nAnother type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table A under the heading of “preferred substitutions”. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated “exemplary substitutions” in Table A, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOriginal\n\n\nExemplary\n\n\nPreferred\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResidue\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla (A)\n\n\nVal; Leu; Ile\n\n\nVal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArg (R)\n\n\nLys; Gln; Asn\n\n\nLys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsn (N)\n\n\nGln; His; Asp, Lys; Arg\n\n\nGln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsp (D)\n\n\nGlu; Asn\n\n\nGlu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys (C)\n\n\nSer; Ala\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln (Q)\n\n\nAsn; Glu\n\n\nAsn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlu (E)\n\n\nAsp; Gln\n\n\nAsp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly (G)\n\n\nAla\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis (H)\n\n\nAsn; Gln; Lys; Arg\n\n\nArg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle (I)\n\n\nLeu; Val; Met; Ala;\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPhe; Norleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeu (L)\n\n\nNorleucine; Ile; Val;\n\n\nIle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMet; Ala; Phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLys (K)\n\n\nArg; Gln; Asn\n\n\nArg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet (M)\n\n\nLeu; Phe; Ile\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe (F)\n\n\nTrp; Leu; Val; Ile; Ala; Tyr\n\n\nTyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro (P)\n\n\nAla\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer (S)\n\n\nThr\n\n\nThr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr (T)\n\n\nVal; Ser\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrp (W)\n\n\nTyr; Phe\n\n\nTyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr (Y)\n\n\nTrp; Phe; Thr; Ser\n\n\nPhe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal (V)\n\n\nIle; Leu; Met; Phe;\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAla; Norleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains (in A. L. Lehninger, in Biochemistry, second ed., pp. 73-75, Worth Publishers, New York (1975)):\n\n \n \n(1) non-polar: Ala (A), Val (V), Leu (L), Ile (I), Pro (P), Phe (F), Trp (W), Met (M)\n \n(2) uncharged polar: Gly (G), Ser (S), Thr (T), Cys (C), Tyr (Y), Asn (N), Gln (O)\n \n(3) acidic: Asp (D), Glu (E)\n \n(4) basic: Lys (K), Arg (R), His (H)\n \n\n\nAlternatively, naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:\n\n\n(1) hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile;\n\n\n(2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln;\n\n\n(3) acidic: Asp, Glu;\n\n\n(4) basic: His, Lys, Arg;\n\n\n(5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro;\n\n\n(6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.\n\n\nNon-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or, into the remaining (non-conserved) sites.\n\n\nOne type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have modified (e.g., improved) biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (e.g. 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to at least part of a phage coat protein (e.g., the gene III product of M13) packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g. binding affinity) as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, scanning mutagenesis (e.g., alanine scanning) can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to techniques known in the art, including those elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening using techniques known in the art, including those described herein, and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.\n\n\nNucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the antibody.\n\n\nIt may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of antibodies of the invention, thereby generating an Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (e.g. a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine.\n\n\nIn accordance with this description and the teachings of the art, it is contemplated that in some embodiments, an antibody of the invention may comprise one or more alterations as compared to the wild type counterpart antibody, e.g. in the Fc region. These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild type counterpart. For example, it is thought that certain alterations can be made in the Fc region that would result in altered (i.e., either improved or diminished) C1q binding and/or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC), e.g., as described in WO99/51642. See also Duncan & Winter \nNature \n322:738-40 (1988); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,648,260; 5,624,821; and WO94/29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides antibodies comprising modifications in the interface of Fc polypeptides comprising the Fc region, wherein the modifications facilitate and/or promote heterodimerization. These modifications comprise introduction of a protuberance into a first Fc polypeptide and a cavity into a second Fc polypeptide, wherein the protuberance is positionable in the cavity so as to promote complexing of the first and second Fc polypeptides. Methods of generating antibodies with these modifications are known in the art, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,168.\n\n\nImmunoconjugates\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides immunoconjugates, or antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, a drug, a growth inhibitory agent, a toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate).\n\n\nThe use of antibody-drug conjugates for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents, i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer (Syrigos and Epenetos (1999) Anticancer Research 19:605-614; Niculescu-Duvaz and Springer (1997) Adv. Drg Del. Rev. 26:151-172; U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,278) allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors, and intracellular accumulation therein, where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated (Baldwin et al., (1986) Lancet pp. (Mar. 15, 1986):603-05; Thorpe, (1985) “Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review,” in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological And Clinical Applications, A. Pinchera et al. (ed.s), pp. 475-506). Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies (Rowland et al., (1986) Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 21:183-87). Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and vindesine (Rowland et al., (1986) supra). Toxins used in antibody-toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin, plant toxins such as ricin, small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin (Mandler et al (2000) Jour. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 92(19):1573-1581; Mandler et al (2000) Bioorganic & Med. Chem. Letters 10:1025-1028; Mandler et al (2002) Bioconjugate Chem. 13:786-791), maytansinoids (EP 1391213; Liu et al., (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8618-8623), and calicheamicin (Lode et al (1998) Cancer Res. 58:2928; Hinman et al (1993) Cancer Res. 53:3336-3342). The toxins may effect their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubutin binding, DNA binding, or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.\n\n\nZEVALIN® (ibritumomab tiuxetan, Biogen/Idec) is an antibody-radioisotope conjugate composed of a murine IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes and \n111\nIn or \n90\nY radioisotope bound by a thiourea linker-chelator (Wiseman et al (2000) Eur. Jour. Nucl. Med. 27(7):766-77; Wiseman et al (2002) Blood 99(12):4336-42; Witzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(10):2453-63; Witzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(15):3262-69). Although ZEVALIN has activity against B-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), administration results in severe and prolonged cytopenias in most patients. MYLOTARG™ (gemtuzumab ozogamicin, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), an antibody drug conjugate composed of a hu CD33 antibody linked to calicheamicin, was approved in 2000 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia by injection (Drugs of the Future (2000) 25(7):686; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,970,198; 5,079,233; 5,585,089; 5,606,040; 5,693,762; 5,739,116; 5,767,285; 5,773,001). Cantuzumab mertansine (Immunogen, Inc.), an antibody drug conjugate composed of the huC242 antibody linked via the disulfide linker SPP to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is tested for the treatment of cancers that express CanAg, such as colon, pancreatic, gastric, and others. MLN-2704 (Millennium Pharm., BZL Biologics, Immunogen Inc.), an antibody drug conjugate composed of the anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) monoclonal antibody linked to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is tested for the potential treatment of prostate tumors. The auristatin peptides, auristatin E (AE) and monomethylauristatin (MMAE), synthetic analogs of dolastatin, were conjugated to chimeric monoclonal antibodies cBR96 (specific to Lewis Y on carcinomas) and cAC10 (specific to CD30 on hematological malignancies) (Doronina et al (2003) Nature Biotechnology 21(7):778-784) and are under therapeutic development.\n\n\nChemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of immunoconjugates are described herein (above). Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, Aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, \nPhytolaca americana \nproteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), \nmomordica charantia \ninhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, and the tricothecenes. See, e.g., WO 93/21232 published Oct. 28, 1993. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include \n212\nBi, \n131\nI, \n131\nIn, \n90\nY, and \n186\nRe. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis-(p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntoluene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al., Science, 238: 1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94/11026.\n\n\nConjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins, such as a calicheamicin, maytansinoids, dolostatins, aurostatins, a trichothecene, and CC1065, and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity, are also contemplated herein.\n\n\nMaytansine and Maytansinoids\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules.\n\n\nMaytansinoids are mitotic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub Maytenus serrata (U.S. Pat. No. 3,896,111). Subsequently, it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids, such as maytansinol and C-3 maytansinol esters (U.S. Pat. No. 4,151,042). Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,137,230; 4,248,870; 4,256,746; 4,260,608; 4,265,814; 4,294,757; 4,307,016; 4,308,268; 4,308,269; 4,309,428; 4,313,946; 4,315,929; 4,317,821; 4,322,348; 4,331,598; 4,361,650; 4,364,866; 4,424,219; 4,450,254; 4,362,663; and 4,371,533.\n\n\nMaytansinoid drug moieties are attractive drug moieties in antibody drug conjugates because they are: (i) relatively accessible to prepare by fermentation or chemical modification, derivatization of fermentation products, (ii) amenable to derivatization with functional groups suitable for conjugation through the non-disulfide linkers to antibodies, (iii) stable in plasma, and (iv) effective against a variety of tumor cell lines.\n\n\nExemplary embodiments of maytansinoid drug moieties include: DM1; DM3; and DM4. Immunoconjugates containing maytansinoids, methods of making same, and their therapeutic use are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020, 5,416,064 and \nEuropean Patent EP\n 0 425 235 B1, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Liu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8618-8623 (1996) described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells, and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al., Cancer Research 52:127-131 (1992) describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines, or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER-2/neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1-maytansonoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3, which expresses 3×10\n5 \nHER-2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug, which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7-maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.\n\n\nAntibody-maytansinoid conjugates can be prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 (the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference). An average of 3-4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody, although even one molecule of toxin/antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Maytansinoids include, but are not limited to, maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule, such as various maytansinol esters.\n\n\nThere are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, including, for example, those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 or \nEP Patent\n 0 425 235 B1, Chari et al., Cancer Research 52:127-131 (1992), and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/960,602, filed Oct. 8, 2004, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Antibody-maytansinoid conjugates comprising the linker component SMCC may be prepared as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/960,602, filed Oct. 8, 2004. The linking groups include disulfide groups, thioether groups, acid labile groups, photolabile groups, peptidase labile groups, or esterase labile groups, as disclosed in the above-identified patents. Additional linking groups are described and exemplified herein.\n\n\nConjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis-(p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntoluene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). Coupling agents include, but are not limited to, N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) (Carlsson et al., Biochem. J. 173:723-737 (1978)) and N-succinimidyl-4-(2-pyridylthio)pentanoate (SPP) to provide for a disulfide linkage.\n\n\nThe linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions, depending on the type of the link. For example, an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C-3 position having a hydroxyl group, the C-14 position modified with hydroxymethyl, the C-15 position modified with a hydroxyl group, and the C-20 position having a hydroxyl group. In one embodiment, the linkage is formed at the C-3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.\n\n\nAuristatins and Dolostatins\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to dolastatins or dolostatin peptidic analogs and derivatives, the auristatins (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,635,483; 5,780,588). Dolastatins and auristatins have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics, GTP hydrolysis, and nuclear and cellular division (Woyke et al (2001) Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. 45(12):3580-3584) and have anticancer (U.S. 5663149) and antifungal activity (Pettit et al (1998) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42:2961-2965). The dolastatin or auristatin drug moiety may be attached to the antibody through the N (amino) terminus or the C (carboxyl) terminus of the peptidic drug moiety (WO 02/088172).\n\n\nExemplary auristatin embodiments include the N-terminus linked monomethylauristatin drug moieties DE and DF, disclosed in “Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands”, U.S. Ser. No. 10/983,340, filed Nov. 5, 2004, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nExemplary auristatin embodiments include MMAE and MMAF. Additional exemplary embodiments comprising MMAE or MMAF and various linker components (described further herein) include Ab-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF, Ab-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE, Ab-MC-MMAE and Ab-MC-MMAF.\n\n\nTypically, peptide-based drug moieties can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and/or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared, for example, according to the liquid phase synthesis method (see E. Schröder and K. Lübke, “The Peptides”, \nvolume\n 1, pp 76-136, 1965, Academic Press) that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry. The auristatin/dolastatin drug moieties may be prepared according to the methods of: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,635,483; 5,780,588; Pettit et al (1989) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111:5463-5465; Pettit et al (1998) Anti-Cancer Drug Design 13:243-277; Pettit, G. R., et al. Synthesis, 1996, 719-725; and Pettit et al (1996) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1 5:859-863. See also Doronina (2003) Nat Biotechnol 21(7):778-784; “Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands”, U.S. Ser. No. 10/983,340, filed Nov. 5, 2004, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety (disclosing, e.g., linkers and methods of preparing monomethylvaline compounds such as MMAE and MMAF conjugated to linkers).\n\n\nCalicheamicin\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics is capable of producing double-stranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,712,374, 5,714,586, 5,739,116, 5,767,285, 5,770,701, 5,770,710, 5,773,001, and 5,877,296 (all to American Cyanamid Company). Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include, but are not limited to, γ\n1\n \nI\n, α\n2\n \nI\n, α\n3\n \nI\n, N-acetyl-γ\n1\n \nI\n, PSAG and θ\nI\n \n1 \n(Hinman et al., Cancer Research 53:3336-3342 (1993), Lode et al., Cancer Research 58:2925-2928 (1998) and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid). Another anti-tumor drug to which the antibody can be conjugated is QFA, which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore, cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.\n\n\nOther Cytotoxic Agents\n\n\nOther antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the antibodies of the invention include BCNU, streptozoicin, vincristine and 5-fluorouracil, the family of agents known collectively LL-E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,053,394, 5,770,710, as well as esperamicins (U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,296).\n\n\nEnzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, Aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, \nPhytolaca americana \nproteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), \nmomordica charantia \ninhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin and the tricothecenes. See, for example, WO 93/21232 published Oct. 28, 1993.\n\n\nThe present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity (e.g., a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease; DNase).\n\n\nFor selective destruction of the tumor, the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At\n211\n, I\n131\n, I\n125\n, Y\n90\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188\n, Sm\n153\n, Bi\n212\n, P\n32\n, Pb\n212 \nand radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the conjugate is used for detection, it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies, for example Tc\n99m \nor I\n123\n, or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging (also known as magnetic resonance imaging, MRI), such as iodine-123 again, iodine-131, indium-111, fluorine-19, carbon-13, nitrogen-15, oxygen-17, gadolinium, manganese or iron.\n\n\nThe radio- or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example, the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving, for example, fluorine-19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as Tc\n99m \nor I\n123\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188 \nand In\n111 \ncan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium-90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method (Fraker et al (1978) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80: 49-57) can be used to incorporate iodine-123. “Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy” (Chatal, CRC Press 1989) describes other methods in detail.\n\n\nConjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis-(p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntoluene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al., Science 238:1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94/11026. The linker may be a “cleavable linker” facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker, peptidase-sensitive linker, photolabile linker, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linker (Chari et al., Cancer Research 52:127-131 (1992); U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020) may be used.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention expressly contemplate, but are not limited to, ADC prepared with cross-linker reagents: BMPS, EMCS, GMBS, HBVS, LC-SMCC, MBS, MPBH, SBAP, SIA, SIAB, SMCC, SMPB, SMPH, sulfo-EMCS, sulfo-GMBS, sulfo-KMUS, sulfo-MBS, sulfo-SIAB, sulfo-SMCC, and sulfo-SMPB, and SVSB (succinimidyl-(4-vinylsulfone)benzoate) which are commercially available (e.g., from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, Ill., U.S.A). See pages 467-498, 2003-2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.\n\n\nPreparation of Antibody Drug Conjugates\n\n\nIn the antibody drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention, an antibody (Ab) is conjugated to one or more drug moieties (D), e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody, through a linker (L). The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes, employing organic chemistry reactions, conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent, to form Ab-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with a drug moiety D; and (2) reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent, to form D-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group of an antibody. Additional methods for preparing ADC are described herein.\n\n\nAb-(L-D)\np\n  I\n\n\n\nThe linker may be composed of one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6-maleimidocaproyl (“MC”), maleimidopropanoyl (“MP”), valine-citrulline (“val-cit”), alanine-phenylalanine (“ala-phe”), p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (“PAB”), N-Succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate (“SPP”), N-Succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 carboxylate (“SMCC”), and N-Succinimidyl (4-iodo-acetyl) aminobenzoate (“SIAB”). Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described herein. See also “Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands”, U.S. Ser. No. 10/983,340, filed Nov. 5, 2004, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the linker may comprise amino acid residues. Exemplary amino acid linker components include a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a tetrapeptide or a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include: valine-citrulline (vc or val-cit), alanine-phenylalanine (af or ala-phe). Exemplary tripeptides include: glycine-valine-citrulline (gly-val-cit) and glycine-glycine-glycine (gly-gly-gly). Amino acid residues which comprise an amino acid linker component include those occurring naturally, as well as minor amino acids and non-naturally occurring amino acid analogs, such as citrulline. Amino acid linker components can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzyme, for example, a tumor-associated protease, cathepsin B, C and D, or a plasmin protease.\n\n\nExemplary linker component structures are shown below (wherein the wavy line indicates sites of covalent attachment to other components of the ADC):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional exemplary linker components and abbreviations include (wherein the antibody (Ab) and linker are depicted, and p is 1 to about 8):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNucleophilic groups on antibodies include, but are not limited to: (i) N-terminal amine groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol). Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody (or fragment thereof) by introducing one, two, three, four, or more cysteine residues (e.g., preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non-native cysteine amino acid residues).\n\n\nAntibody drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties, which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized, e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage, or may be reduced, e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment, reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug (Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques). In another embodiment, proteins containing N-terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (Geoghegan & Stroh, (1992) Bioconjugate Chem. 3:138-146; U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,852). Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.\n\n\nLikewise, nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include, but are not limited to: amine, thiol, hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups.\n\n\nAlternatively, a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made, e.g., by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent to one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the antibody may be conjugated to a “receptor” (such streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pre-targeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a “ligand” (e.g., avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a radionucleotide).\n\n\nAntibody (Ab)-MC-MMAE may be prepared by conjugation of any of the antibodies provided herein with MC-MMAE as follows. Antibody, dissolved in 500 mM sodium borate and 500 mM sodium chloride at pH 8.0 is treated with an excess of 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). After incubation at 37° C. for about 30 minutes, the buffer is exchanged by elution over Sephadex G25 resin and eluted with PBS with 1 mM DTPA. The thiol/Ab value is checked by determining the reduced antibody concentration from the absorbance at 280 nm of the solution and the thiol concentration by reaction with DTNB (Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wis.) and determination of the absorbance at 412 nm. The reduced antibody dissolved in PBS is chilled on ice. The drug linker reagent, maleimidocaproyl-monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), i.e. MC-MMAE, dissolved in DMSO, is diluted in acetonitrile and water at known concentration, and added to the chilled reduced antibody 2H9 in PBS. After about one hour, an excess of maleimide is added to quench the reaction and cap any unreacted antibody thiol groups. The reaction mixture is concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration and 2H9-MC-MMAE is purified and desalted by elution through G25 resin in PBS, filtered through 0.2 μm filters under sterile conditions, and frozen for storage.\n\n\nAntibody-MC-MMAF may be prepared by conjugation of any of the antibodies provided herein with MC-MMAF following the protocol provided for preparation of Ab-MC-MMAE.\n\n\nAntibody-MC-val-cit-PAB-MMAE is prepared by conjugation of any of the antibodies provided herein with MC-val-cit-PAB-MMAE following the protocol provided for preparation of Ab-MC-MMAE.\n\n\nAntibody-MC-val-cit-PAB-MMAF is prepared by conjugation of any of the antibodies provided herein with MC-val-cit-PAB-MMAF following the protocol provided for preparation of Ab-MC-MMAE.\n\n\nAntibody-SMCC-DM1 is prepared by conjugation of any of the antibodies provided herein with SMCC-DM1 as follows. Purified antibody is derivatized with (Succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC, Pierce Biotechnology, Inc) to introduce the SMCC linker. Specifically, antibody is treated at 20 mg/mL in 50 mM potassium phosphate/50 mM sodium chloride/2 mM EDTA, pH 6.5 with 7.5 molar equivalents of SMCC (20 mM in DMSO, 6.7 mg/mL). After stirring for 2 hours under argon at ambient temperature, the reaction mixture is filtered through a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate/50 mM sodium chloride/2 mM EDTA, pH 6.5. Antibody-containing fractions are pooled and assayed.\n\n\nAntibody-SMCC prepared thusly is diluted with 50 mM potassium phosphate/50 mM sodium chloride/2 mM EDTA, pH 6.5, to a final concentration of about 10 mg/ml, and reacted with a 10 mM solution of DM1 in dimethylacetamide. The reaction is stirred at ambient temperature under argon for 16.5 hours. The conjugation reaction mixture is filtered through a Sephadex G25 gel filtration column (1.5×4.9 cm) with 1×PBS at pH 6.5. The DM1 drug to antibody ratio (p) may be about 2 to 5, as measured by the absorbance at 252 nm and at 280 nm.\n\n\nAb-SPP-DM1 is prepared by conjugation of any of the antibodies provided herein with SPP-DM1 as follows. Purified antibody is derivatized with N-succinimidyl-4-(2-pyridylthio)pentanoate to introduce dithiopyridyl groups. Antibody (376.0 mg, 8 mg/mL) in 44.7 mL of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing NaCl (50 mM) and EDTA (1 mM) is treated with SPP (5.3 molar equivalents in 2.3 mL ethanol). After incubation for 90 minutes under argon at ambient temperature, the reaction mixture is gel filtered through a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with a 35 mM sodium citrate, 154 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA buffer. Antibody-containing fractions were pooled and assayed. The degree of modification of the antibody is determined as described above.\n\n\nAntibody-SPP-Py (about 10 μmoles of releasable 2-thiopyridine groups) is diluted with the above 35 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.5, to a final concentration of about 2.5 mg/mL. DM1 (1.7 equivalents, 17 μmoles) in 3.0 mM dimethylacetamide (DMA, 3% v/v in the final reaction mixture) is then added to the antibody solution. The reaction proceeds at ambient temperature under argon for about 20 hours. The reaction is loaded on a Sephacryl S300 gel filtration column (5.0 cm×90.0 cm, 1.77 L) equilibrated with 35 mM sodium citrate, 154 mM NaCl, pH 6.5. The flow rate may be about 5.0 mL/min and 65 fractions (20.0 mL each) are collected. The number of DM1 drug molecules linked per antibody molecule (p′) is determined by measuring the absorbance at 252 nm and 280 nm, and may be about 2 to 4 DM1 drug moieties per 2H9 antibody.\n\n\nAntibody-BMPEO-DM1 is prepared by conjugation of any of the antibodies provided herein with BMPEO-DM1 as follows. The antibody is modified by the bis-maleimido reagent BM(PEO)4 (Pierce Chemical), leaving an unreacted maleimido group on the surface of the antibody. This may be accomplished by dissolving BM(PEO)4 in a 50% ethanol/water mixture to a concentration of 10 mM and adding a tenfold molar excess to a solution containing antibody in phosphate buffered saline at a concentration of approximately 1.6 mg/ml (10 micromolar) and allowing it to react for 1 hour to form an antibody-linker intermediate, 2H9-BMPEO. Excess BM(PEO)4 is removed by gel filtration (HiTrap column, Pharmacia) in 30 mM citrate, \npH\n 6 with 150 mM NaCl buffer. An approximate 10 fold molar excess DM1 is dissolved in dimethyl acetamide (DMA) and added to the 2H9-BMPEO intermediate. Dimethyl formamide (DMF) may also be employed to dissolve the drug moiety reagent. The reaction mixture is allowed to react overnight before gel filtration or dialysis into PBS to remove unreacted DM1. Gel filtration on S200 columns in PBS is used to remove high molecular weight aggregates and to furnish purified 2H9-BMPEO-DM1.\n\n\nAntibody Derivatives\n\n\nAntibodies of the invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. In one embodiment, the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble polymers. Non-limiting examples of water soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1,3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either homopolymers or random copolymers), and dextran or poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers, prolypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary, and if more than one polymer is attached, the polymers can be the same or different molecules. In general, the number and/or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including, but not limited to, the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved, whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions, etc.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, conjugates of an antibody and nonproteinaceous moiety that may be selectively heated by exposure to radiation are provided. In one embodiment, the nonproteinaceous moiety is a carbon nanotube (Kam et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 102: 11600-11605 (2005)). The radiation may be of any wavelength, and includes, but is not limited to, wavelengths that do not harm ordinary cells, but which heat the nonproteinaceous moiety to a temperature at which cells proximal to the antibody-nonproteinaceous moiety are killed.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Formulations\n\n\nTherapeutic formulations comprising an antibody of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (\nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)), in the form of aqueous solutions, lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, histidine and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\nThe formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, including, but not limited to those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.\n\n\nThe active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsule and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsule, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).\n\n\nThe formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.\n\n\nSustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the immunoglobulin of the invention, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsule. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and γ ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated immunoglobulins remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37° C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S—S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.\n\n\nUses\n\n\nAn antibody of the invention may be used in, for example, in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo therapeutic methods. Antibodies of the invention can be used as an antagonist to partially or fully block the specific antigen activity in vitro, ex vivo and/or in vivo. Moreover, at least some of the antibodies of the invention can neutralize antigen activity from other species. Accordingly, antibodies of the invention can be used to inhibit a specific antigen activity, e.g., in a cell culture containing the antigen, in human subjects or in other mammalian subjects having the antigen with which an antibody of the invention cross-reacts (e.g. chimpanzee, baboon, marmoset, cynomolgus and rhesus, pig or mouse). In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention can be used for inhibiting antigen activities by contacting the antibody with the antigen such that antigen activity is inhibited. In one embodiment, the antigen is a human protein molecule.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, an antibody of the invention can be used in a method for inhibiting an antigen in a subject suffering from a disorder in which the antigen activity is detrimental, comprising administering to the subject an antibody of the invention such that the antigen activity in the subject is inhibited. In one embodiment, the antigen is a human protein molecule and the subject is a human subject. Alternatively, the subject can be a mammal expressing the antigen with which an antibody of the invention binds. Still further the subject can be a mammal into which the antigen has been introduced (e.g., by administration of the antigen or by expression of an antigen transgene). An antibody of the invention can be administered to a human subject for therapeutic purposes. Moreover, an antibody of the invention can be administered to a non-human mammal expressing an antigen with which the antibody cross-reacts (e.g., a primate, pig or mouse) for veterinary purposes or as an animal model of human disease. Regarding the latter, such animal models may be useful for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies of the invention (e.g., testing of dosages and time courses of administration). Antibodies of the invention can be used to treat, inhibit, delay progression of, prevent/delay recurrence of, ameliorate, or prevent diseases, disorders or conditions associated with abnormal expression and/or activity of polyubiquitins and polyubiquitinated proteins, including but not limited to cancer, muscular disorders, ubiquitin-pathway-related genetic disorders, immune/inflammatory disorders, neurological disorders, and other ubiquitin pathway-related disorders.\n\n\nIn one aspect, a blocking antibody of the invention is specific for a polyubiquitin having a K63 lysine linkage, and inhibits normal K63-linked polyubiquitin activity by blocking or interfering with the interaction between a K63-linked polyubiquitin and a protein that interacts with that K63-linked polyubiquitin, thereby inhibiting the corresponding signal pathway and other associated molecular or cellular events. In another aspect, a blocking antibody of the invention specific for K63-linked polyubiquitin interacts with one or more proteins conjugated with K63-linked polyubiquitin, thereby inhibiting the interaction of the protein with signal pathways or other binding partners and interfering with associated molecular or cellular events.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, an immunoconjugate comprising an antibody of the invention conjugated with a cytotoxic agent is administered to the patient. In some embodiments, the immunoconjugate and/or antigen to which it is bound is/are internalized by cells expressing one or more proteins on their cell surface which are associated with K63-linked polyubiquitin, resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy of the immunoconjugate in killing the target cell with which it is associated. In one embodiment, the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with nucleic acid in the target cell. Examples of such cytotoxic agents include any of the chemotherapeutic agents noted herein (such as a maytansinoid or a calicheamicin), a radioactive isotope, or a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease.\n\n\nAntibodies of the invention can be used either alone or in combination with other compositions in a therapy. For instance, an antibody of the invention may be co-administered with another antibody, and/or adjuvant/therapeutic agents (e.g., steroids). For instance, an antibody of the invention may be combined with an anti-inflammatory and/or antiseptic in a treatment scheme, e.g. in treating any of the diseases described herein, including cancer, muscular disorders, ubiquitin-pathway-related genetic disorders, immune/inflammatory disorders, neurological disorders, and other ubiquitin pathway-related disorders. Such combined therapies noted above include combined administration (where the two or more agents are included in the same or separate formulations), and separate administration, in which case, administration of the antibody of the invention can occur prior to, and/or following, administration of the adjunct therapy or therapies.\n\n\nAn antibody of the invention (and adjunct therapeutic agent) can be administered by any suitable means, including parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. In addition, the antibody is suitably administered by pulse infusion, particularly with declining doses of the antibody. Dosing can be by any suitable route, e.g. by injections, such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.\n\n\nThe location of the binding target of an antibody of the invention may be taken into consideration in preparation and administration of the antibody. When the binding target is an intracellular molecule, certain embodiments of the invention provide for the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof to be introduced into the cell where the binding target is located. In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention can be expressed intracellularly as an intrabody. The term “intrabody,” as used herein, refers to an antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof that is expressed intracellularly and that is capable of selectively binding to a target molecule, as described in Marasco, Gene Therapy 4: 11-15 (1997); Kontermann, Methods 34: 163-170 (2004); U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,004,940 and 6,329,173; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0104402, and PCT Publication No. WO2003/077945. Intracellular expression of an intrabody is effected by introducing a nucleic acid encoding the desired antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof (lacking the wild-type leader sequence and secretory signals normally associated with the gene encoding that antibody or antigen-binding fragment) into a target cell. Any standard method of introducing nucleic acids into a cell may be used, including, but not limited to, microinjection, ballistic injection, electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation, liposomes, and transfection with retroviral, adenoviral, adeno-associated viral and vaccinia vectors carrying the nucleic acid of interest. One or more nucleic acids encoding all or a portion of an anti-polyubiquitin antibody of the invention can be delivered to a target cell, such that one or more intrabodies are expressed which are capable of intracellular binding to a polyubiquitin and modulation of one or more polyubiquitin-mediated cellular pathways.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, internalizing antibodies are provided. Antibodies can possess certain characteristics that enhance delivery of antibodies into cells, or can be modified to possess such characteristics. Techniques for achieving this are known in the art. For example, cationization of an antibody is known to facilitate its uptake into cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,703,019). Lipofections or liposomes can also be used to deliver the antibody into cells. Where antibody fragments are used, the smallest inhibitory fragment that specifically binds to the binding domain of the target protein is generally advantageous. For example, based upon the variable-region sequences of an antibody, peptide molecules can be designed that retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence. Such peptides can be synthesized chemically and/or produced by recombinant DNA technology. See, e.g., Marasco et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n90: 7889-7893 (1993).\n\n\nEntry of modulator polypeptides into target cells can be enhanced by methods known in the art. For example, certain sequences, such as those derived from HIV Tat or the Antennapedia homeodomain protein are able to direct efficient uptake of heterologous proteins across cell membranes. See, e.g., Chen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1999), 96:4325-4329.\n\n\nWhen the binding target is located in the brain, certain embodiments of the invention provide for the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof to traverse the blood-brain barrier. Certain neurodegenerative diseases are associated with an increase in permeability of the blood-brain barrier, such that the antibody or antigen-binding fragment can be readily introduced to the brain. When the blood-brain barrier remains intact, several art-known approaches exist for transporting molecules across it, including, but not limited to, physical methods, lipid-based methods, and receptor and channel-based methods.\n\n\nPhysical methods of transporting the antibody or antigen-binding fragment across the blood-brain barrier include, but are not limited to, circumventing the blood-brain barrier entirely, or by creating openings in the blood-brain barrier. Circumvention methods include, but are not limited to, direct injection into the brain (see, e.g., Papanastassiou et al., Gene Therapy 9: 398-406 (2002)), interstitial infusion/convection-enhanced delivery (see, e.g., Bobo et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91: 2076-2080 (1994)), and implanting a delivery device in the brain (see, e.g., Gill et al., Nature Med. 9: 589-595 (2003); and Gliadel Wafers™, Guildford Pharmaceutical). Methods of creating openings in the barrier include, but are not limited to, ultrasound (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0038086), osmotic pressure (e.g., by administration of hypertonic mannitol (Neuwelt, E. A., Implication of the Blood-Brain Barrier and its Manipulation, \nVols\n 1 & 2, Plenum Press, N.Y. (1989))), permeabilization by, e.g., bradykinin or permeabilizer A-7 (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,112,596, 5,268,164, 5,506,206, and 5,686,416), and transfection of neurons that straddle the blood-brain barrier with vectors containing genes encoding the antibody or antigen-binding fragment (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0083299).\n\n\nLipid-based methods of transporting the antibody or antigen-binding fragment across the blood-brain barrier include, but are not limited to, encapsulating the antibody or antigen-binding fragment in liposomes that are coupled to antibody binding fragments that bind to receptors on the vascular endothelium of the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20020025313), and coating the antibody or antigen-binding fragment in low-density lipoprotein particles (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040204354) or apolipoprotein E (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040131692).\n\n\nReceptor and channel-based methods of transporting the antibody or antigen-binding fragment across the blood-brain barrier include, but are not limited to, using glucocorticoid blockers to increase permeability of the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2002/0065259, 2003/0162695, and 2005/0124533); activating potassium channels (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0089473), inhibiting ABC drug transporters (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0073713); coating antibodies with a transferrin and modulating activity of the one or more transferrin receptors (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0129186), and cationizing the antibodies (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,004,697).\n\n\nThe antibody composition of the invention would be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibodies of the invention present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein, or about from 1 to 99% of the dosages described herein, or in any dosage and by any route that is empirically/clinically determined to be appropriate.\n\n\nFor the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention (when used alone or in combination with other agents such as chemotherapeutic agents) will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the type of antibody, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 μg/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1 mg/kg-10 mg/kg) of antibody can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 μg/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment would generally be sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg. Thus, one or more doses of about 0.5 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg (or any combination thereof) may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently, e.g. every week or every three weeks (e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty, or e.g. about six doses of the antibody). An initial higher loading dose, followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg/kg of the antibody. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.\n\n\nArticles of Manufacture\n\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment, prevention and/or diagnosis of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, etc. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a composition which is by itself or when combined with another composition effective for treating, preventing and/or diagnosing the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is an antibody of the invention. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice. Moreover, the article of manufacture may comprise (a) a first container with a composition contained therein, wherein the composition comprises an antibody of the invention; and (b) a second container with a composition contained therein, wherein the composition comprises a further cytotoxic or otherwise therapeutic agent. The article of manufacture in this embodiment of the invention may further comprise a package insert indicating that the compositions can be used to treat a particular condition. Alternatively, or additionally, the article of manufacture may further comprise a second (or third) container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.\n\n\nThe following are examples of the methods and compositions of the invention. It is understood that various other embodiments may be practiced, given the general description provided above.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nAffinity Maturation of a K63-Linked Diubiquitin-Specific Antibody Fragment\n\n\nPanels of antibodies able to discriminate between K48-linked polyubiquitin and K63-linked polyubiquitin were described in US Patent Publication No. US2007-0218069, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The affinity and specificity of the best anti-K63-linked Fab identified in that publication (Apu2.16, Kd of approximately 100 nM and a small amount of artifactual binding to K48-linked polyubiquitin) was inferior to the affinity and specificity of the best anti-K48-linked Fab identified in that publication (Apu2.07, Kd of approximately 1 nM, no observed binding to K63-linked polyubiquitin). An improved K63-linked polyubiquitin-specific Fab/antibody was sought to facilitate applications in which greater specificity or affinity of the Fab/antibody would be desirable.\n\n\n(A) Library Generation\n\n\nThe Apu2.16 anti-K63-linked diubiquitin antibody fragment (Fab) was subjected to mutagenesis in order to affinity mature the antibody. \n \nResidues\n \n 49, 50, 52, and 53 of CDR L2 and \nresidues\n 50, 52, 53, 54, and 56 of CDR H2 were selected for mutagenesis based on their contact with K63-linked diubiquitin, as shown in the co-crystal structure of Apu2.16 and K63-linked diubiquitin (see \nFIG. 2\n and US Patent Publication No. US2007-0218069, incorporated herein in its entirety). An Apu2.16 stop template with TAA stop codons at \npositions\n 51 of CDR L2 and 52a of CDR H2 was used to force mutagenesis of both CDR regions. Expression of this construct was under the control of the bacterial alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) promoter. Both the light chain and the heavy chain contained an amino terminal bacterial stII signal sequence to permit secretion in \nE. coli\n. The heavy chain carboxyl terminus was fused in-frame to an amber stop codon followed by gene product III of the M13 bacteriophage, allowing for monovalent Fab display on phage when expressed in an amber suppressor \nE. coli \nstrain. Degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized to soft-randomize the positions of contact so that 50% of the time the Apu2.16 wild-type residue would be retained and 50% of the time one of the remaining 19 amino acids would be encoded. To achieve soft randomization, oligonucleotides were designed such that certain nucleotide positions were occupied 70% of the time with the indicated base and 10% of the time occupied by one of the three other bases (Gallop et al., J. Med. Chem. 37: 1233 (1994)). Where such soft randomization was included at a particular base, the presence of the soft randomization is indicated by the presence of a number at that base position. The number “5” indicates that the base adenine was present 70% of the time at that position, while the bases guanine, cytosine, and thymine were each present 10% of the time. Similarly, the number “6” refers to guanine, “7” to cytosine, and “8” to thymine, where in each case, each of the other three bases was present only 10% of the time.\n\n\nMutagenic oligonucleotides 310887 (CCGAAGCTTCTGATT857876GCA877567CTCTACTCTGGAGTC) (SEQ ID NO: 1) and 310890 (GGCCTGGAATGGGTTGCA858ATT878CCT858858GGC 878ACTTCTTATGCCGATAGC) (SEQ ID NO: 2) were used with 40 μg of Kunkel DNA of the Apu2.16 stop template in a Kunkel mutagenesis reaction (see Kunkel, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82: 488 (1985) and Sidhu et al., Meth. Enzymol. 328: 333 (2000)). The mutagenesis reaction was electroporated into ElectroTen Blue \nE. coli \n(Stratagene) and recovered in 25 mL of SOC medium for 45 minutes at 37° C. with shaking. Twenty microliters were removed and ten-fold serial dilutions were plated onto solid agar plates containing carbenicillin and grown overnight at 37° C. to determine the library size. The remaining culture was transferred to 500 mL of 2YT broth containing 50 μg/mL carbenicillin, 50 μg/mL kanamycin, and 10\n10 \nphage/mL M13K07 helper phage (New England Biolabs). The culture was grown for 14 hours at 30° C. with shaking. The library contained approximately 3×10\n10 \nCFUs. The phage were purified from the culture supernatant by two rounds of precipitation with ⅕ volume of 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG)/2.5 M NaCl.\n\n\n(B) Library Sorting\n\n\nAmplified phage were used in sorting against enzymatically synthesized K63-linked diubiquitin (Boston Biochem) immobilized on 96-well Maxisorb immunoplates (Nunc). The plates were coated overnight at 4° C. with 5 μg/mL K63-linked diubiquitin in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The coated plates were blocked with 2.5% milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) for one hour at 25° C. with shaking. The phage were diluted to an OD\n268 \nof 5.0 in 2.5% milk/PBST and incubated on ice for one hour. After blocking, the plate was washed five times with PBST. One hundred microliters/well of the phage was added and incubated at 25° C. for one hour with shaking. After binding, the plate was washed ten times with PBST. Phage were eluted with 100 μL/well of 100 mM HCl for 20 minutes at 25° C. with shaking. The eluate was neutralized with 1/10 volume 1 M Tris, pH 11.0 and subsequently propagated in XL-1 blue \nE. coli \n(Stratagene) with the addition of M13K07 helper phage.\n\n\nAmplified phage were used in subsequent rounds of sorting. The second sort was performed as described above, with the exception that 100 nM biotinylated K63-linked diubiquitin was used as a target in solution and the phage were used at an OD\n268 \nof 1.0. The biotinylated K63-linked diubiquitin along with bound phage were captured on 5 μg/mL neutravidin-coated immunoplates. The third sorting round was performed similarly to the second round, with the addition of soluble 100 nM K48-linked diubiquitin and 100 nM monoubiquitin (Boston Biochem) as competitors in the phage blocking and phage binding steps. In the fourth sorting round the biotinylated K63-linked diubiquitin target concentration was decreased to 10 nM and the K48-linked diubiquitin and monoubiquitin competitor concentrations were increased to 1 μM each. Enrichment for binding to biotinylated K63-linked diubiquitin compared to neutravidin alone was observed after rounds three and four.\n\n\nNinety-six individual clones from the fourth sort were grown up in a 96-well format in 1 mL of 2YT broth containing 50 μg/mL carbenicillin and 10\n10 \nphage/mL M13K07 helper phage. Supernatants from those cultures were used in high-throughput phage ELISAs for binding to K63-linked diubiquitin, K48-linked diubiquitin, monoubiquitin, or the uncoated wells of the plate. Fifty-one clones demonstrated specific binding to K63-linked diubiquitin and their DNA was sequenced using standard procedures. The sequences of CDRs L2 and H2 for each clone are shown in Table B. CDRs L1, L3, H1, and H3 were not sequenced, but since they were not targeted for mutagenesis they were expected to retain the Apu2.16 template CDR L1 sequence (RASQSVSSAVA) (SEQ ID NO: 3), CDR L3 sequence (QQYSSYSSLFT) (SEQ ID NO: 4), CDR H1 sequence (VKTGLI) (SEQ ID NO: 5), and CDR H3 sequence (EYYRWYTAI) (SEQ ID NO: 6), which had not been targeted for mutagenesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

by a signal ratio of greater than ten for binding to K63-linked diubiquitin relative to K48-linked diubiquitin in the phage spot ELISA described above) were selected for soluble Fab production. Plasmids encoding these Fabs were transformed into \nE. coli \nand plated on solid agar containing carbenicillin. Single colonies were used to inoculate 25 mL of 2YT broth containing 50 μg/mL carbenicillin. Cultures were grown overnight at 37° C. and 5 mL were used to inoculate 500 mL of complete C.R.A.P. media (3.57 g (NH\n4\n)\n2\nSO\n4\n, 0.71 g sodium citrate 2H\n2\nO, 1.07 g KCl, 5.36 g yeast extract, 5.36 g Hycase SF (Sheffield), pH adjusted to 7.3 by addition of KOH and volume adjusted to 872 mL with ultrapure water, autoclaved, cooled to 55° C., to which was added (per L) 110 mL 1 M MOPS pH 7.3, 11 \nmL\n 50% glucose, and 7 mL 1 M MgSO\n4\n) with 50 μg/mL carbenicillin. Cultures were grown at 30° C. for 24 hours with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and pellets were stored at −20° C. Fabs were purified by resuspending each pellet in 35 mL cold wash buffer (PBS+150 mM NaCl) containing 10 μg/mL DNase I, 0.2 mg/mL lysozyme, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride (PMSF). Pellets were resuspended by vortexing rapidly for 45 minutes at 25° C. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation and lysates were loaded on 1 mL protein A-sepharose columns (GE Health Sciences) preequilibrated with cold wash buffer. The columns were washed with 50 mL cold wash buffer, eluted with 3 mL 0.1 M acetic acid, and neutralized with 150 μL of 2M Tris, pH 11.0. The Fabs were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units (5 KD cut-off, Millipore). The resulting Fab concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, and the concentrated Fabs were stored at 4° C.\n\n\n(D) Affinity Analysis of Isolated Fabs\n\n\nThe affinities of the 24 selected Fabs (see Example 1(C), above), were determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using a BIACORE™ A100 system (Biacore). Approximately 50 resonance units of K63-linked diubiquitin or K48-linked diubiquitin were immobilized in two of the four flow cells of a CM5 chip using the amine coupling protocol supplied by the manufacturer. One flow cell on each CM5 chip was activated and ethanolamine blocked without immobilizing protein, to be used as a reference. Two-fold serial dilutions (31.25-500 nM) of each Fab were injected (60 μL total at a flow rate of 30 μL/min) over each flow cell. The reference signal was subtracted from each flow cell signal. Following a dissociation period (10 minutes), the chip surface was regenerated with 15 μL of 10 mM HCl. Kinetic constants and binding constants were simultaneously calculated by nonlinear regression analysis, using software provided by the manufacturer, and are shown in Table C. The average (Avg) from three separate measurements of the kinetic constants and binding constants of the parental Apu2.16 Fab, and from single measurements for the 24 affinity matured Fabs are shown. Neither the parental Apu2.16 Fab, nor any of the 24 affinity matured Fabs demonstrated detectable binding to K48-linked diubiquitin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding Constants for Affinity Matured Anti-K63-linked Polyubiquitin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFabs Binding to K63-linked Diubiquitin as Measured by SPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nclone\n\n\nkon (1/Ms)\n\n\nkoff (1/s)\n\n\nKd (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu2.16 Avg\n\n\n4.9 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n5.4 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStandard\n\n\n0.49 × 10\n5\n \n \n \n\n\n2.0 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndeviation for\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu2.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmeasurements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.A8\n\n\n1.7 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.4 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n8.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.A9\n\n\n2.3 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n9.9 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.A12\n\n\n9.9 × 10\n9\n \n\n\n6.2 × 10\n1\n \n \n \n\n\n6.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.B3\n\n\n4.8 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.9 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n6.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.B5\n\n\n1.0 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n4.6 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.C1\n\n\n4.3 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n7.8 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.C4\n\n\n4.7 × 10\n8\n \n\n\n3.4 × 10\n1\n \n \n \n\n\n73\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.C5\n\n\n1.0 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.9 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.D3\n\n\n7.9 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n6.1 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.D7\n\n\n8.1 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n3.7 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.D8\n\n\n3.9 × 10\n8\n \n\n\n4.4 × 10\n0\n \n \n \n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.E1\n\n\n1.1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.1 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.E2\n\n\n1.0 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n3.0 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.E4\n\n\n7.2 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n8.2 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.E5\n\n\n1.0 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.6 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.F1\n\n\n8.3 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n2.3 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.G1\n\n\n6.5 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n5.4 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n84\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.G2\n\n\n6.1 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n5.4 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.G3\n\n\n1.0 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n4.1 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.G4\n\n\n7.3 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n2.4 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.G5\n\n\n1.1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n3.1 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.H5\n\n\n1.0 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.9 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.H6\n\n\n3.6 × 10\n9\n \n\n\n7.8 × 10\n1\n \n \n \n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApu3.H7\n\n\n2.0 × 10\n4\n \n\n\n9.2 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(E) Western Blots of Affinity Matured Fabs\n\n\nThe binding constants obtained from the SPR analysis in Example 1(D) indicated that three clones (Apu3.A8, Apu3.A12, and Apu3.B3) displayed single digit nanomolar binding. These three Fabs along with the parental Apu2.16 Fab were tested for detection of K63-linked diubiquitin and K48-linked diubiquitin in a western blot. Six concentrations of K63-linked diubiquitin (31-1000 ng) and three concentrations of K48-linked diubiquitin (250-1000 ng) were run on a 4-12% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen), transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, and blotted with the parental clone and the three affinity-matured Fabs. The Fabs contained a carboxy-terminal 6×-His tag and were thus detected with an anti-pentaHis-HRP conjugated secondary antibody (Qiagen) followed by chemiluminescence development. All four Fabs specifically detected K63-linked diubiquitin (see \nFIG. 3\n). No binding to K48-linked diubiquitin was observed for any of the four Fabs tested.\n\n\n(F) Conversion to IgG\n\n\nThe parental Fab Apu2.16 and the three affinity-matured Fabs Apu3.A8, \nApu3.A\n 12, Apu3.B3 were expressed in HEK293 cells as human IgGs. Expression constructs were generated by cloning the Fab variable domains into pRK mammalian expression constructs encoding the heavy and light chains of human IgG (Gorman et al., DNA Prot. Eng. Tech. 2: 3-10 (1990)). IgGs were purified by affinity chromatography on protein A-sepharose columns by standard methodologies.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nDetection of Endogenously Ubiquitinated Proteins\n\n\nThe activity of the affinity-matured anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin IgGs described in Example 1(F) was assessed. For western blot analyses, polyubiquitin or polyubiquitinated proteins were run on polyacrylamide gels and the contents of the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose blots following standard procedures in the art. The resulting nitrocellulose blots were blocked for approximately an hour in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) containing 5% non-fat milk powder. The primary anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibody (either the parental Apu2.16 antibody in IgG format, or Apu3.A8, Apu3.A12, or Apu3.B3 in IgG format) was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/mL for a minimum of 1 hour at room temperature. Overnight incubations were performed at 4° C. The blots were washed three times in TBST, 10 minutes per wash. Bound anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies were detected with peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG (ICN Cappel) diluted 1:10,000 in TBST containing 5% non-fat milk powder. After one hour at room temperature, the blots were washed 3-6 times in TBST, incubated in Supersignal (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and exposed to film. For the western blots of endogenously ubiquitinated proteins, 293T cells were transfected with or without a vector expressing 3×HA-tagged TRAF6 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested two days post-transfection after culture in 25 μM MG-132 (Calbiochem) for the final hour. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then protein extracts were prepared in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 135 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM N-ethyl-maleimide) supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche).\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIGS. 4 and 5\n, each of the three tested affinity-matured anti-K63-linked IgGs worked better in western blots than the parental Apu2.16 IgG. \nFIG. 4\n depicts the results of a western blot against immobilized purified K48-linked or K63-linked polyubiquitin containing two to seven ubiquitin subunits. The parental IgG Apu2.16 did not detect K63-linked or K48-linked polyubiquitin of any number of ubiquitin subunits at any concentration tested. Affinity matured IgGs Apu3.A8, Apu3.A12, or Apu3.B3 detected K63-linked polyubiquitin containing 2 to 6 subunits at each concentration tested, and of seven subunits at all but the lowest concentration tested. No nonspecific binding to K48-linked polyubiquitin was observed with any of the three affinity-matured IgGs. To ascertain whether the affinity-matured antibodies were able to detect endogenously ubiquitinated proteins, 293T cells were transfected with TRAF6 and treated with MG-132, which has been found to result in K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 in vivo (Wertz et al., Nature (2004) 430: 694-699). Similar to the western blot with immobilized purified polyubiquitin in \nFIG. 4\n, the parental Apu2.16 IgG was not able to detect K63-linked polyubiquitinated TRAF6 or any other K63-linked polyubiquitinated proteins in a western blot assay (\nFIG. 5\n). However, each of antibodies Apu3.A8, Apu3.A12, and Apu3.B3 specifically detected K63-linked polyubiquitinated TRAF6 and other K63-linked polyubiquitinated proteins in the same western blot assay (\nFIG. 5\n).\n\n\nThe preceding experiments confirmed that the affinity-matured antibodies were capable of detecting immobilized polyubiquitinated proteins. Further experiments were performed to ascertain whether these antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate polyubiquitinated proteins. For immunoprecipitation assays, the previously described lysis buffer also contained 6 M urea and the cells were lysed at room temperature for 15 minutes. Insoluble material was then removed by centrifugation and the soluble lysate diluted in regular lysis buffer to lower the urea concentration to 0.29M. Lysates were precleared with protein A-sepharose (GE) for 1 hour at 4° C. and then incubated with 5 μg of the antibody indicated for 1 hour at 4° C. Antibody complexes were captured with protein A-sepharose at 4° C. for 1 hour, washed extensively in lysis buffer, and eluted by boiling in Novex Tris-glycine SDS-sample buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol.\n\n\nWhen TRAF6-containing lysates were denatured in the presence of 1% SDS to dissociate it from other ubiquitinated proteins, and immunoprecipitations were performed following dilution of the SDS to as low as 0.05%, no TRAF6 was captured by the K63-specific antibodies (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation of TRAF6 was successful, however, when TRAF6-expressing cells were lysed in the presence of an alternate denaturant: 6M urea. As shown in \nFIG. 6A\n, the three affinity-matured antibodies immunoprecipitated K63-linked polyubiquitinated Traf6 better than the parental antibody Apu2.16, showing that the affinity-matured antibodies were improved in binding to endogenously K63-ubiquitinated proteins in solution as compared to the parental anti-K63-polyubiquitin antibody. In further experiments, treatment of the immunoprecipitated K63-linked polyubiquitinated material with the promiscuous deubiquitinating enzyme Usp2 for increasing periods of time collapsed the smear of higher molecular weight bands observed in \nFIG. 6A\n and in the second lane of \nFIG. 6B\n, confirming that the immunoprecipitated TRAF6 was ubiquitinated (\nFIG. 6B\n, lanes 3-5). Non-specific proteolytic activity potentially associated with Usp2 was unlikely to have been responsible for the observed disappearance of the slower migrating species because inhibition of Usp2 deubiquitinating activity using the cysteine protease inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) prevented collapse of the smear (\nFIG. 6B\n, lane 6). A portion of the TRAF6 immunoprecipitated by the K63-specific antibody Apu3.A8 appeared, by its migration, to be unmodified TRAF6, likely attributable to over-expression of TRAF6 inducing the formation of self-oligomers that trap unmodified TRAF6.\n\n\nThese results were confirmed by mass spectrometry experiments. When polyubiquitin chains are digested with trypsin, unique peptides corresponding to each of the 7 different types of lysine linkage may be observed. This follows the general consensus of a GlyGly motif on a miscleaved lysine. Each of the seven possible polyubiquitin chain linkages yields a unique peptide with a unique mass (when measured at 10 ppm mass accuracy) and also a unique fragmentation pattern upon collision-induced dissociation. Therefore using a high resolution mass spectrometer, along with targeted analysis against the specific signature peptides of interest one can monitor and quantitate the levels of abundance of either the K48 or K63 polyubiquitin chain linkage. Briefly, immunoprecipitation reactions from BJAB cells were performed as described above using an anti-K48-linked antibody, a mixture of the three affinity-matured anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin IgGs Apu3.A8, Apu3.A12, and Apu3.B3, or a control antibody (Herceptin®). Proteins were extracted from the beads chemically using acetonitrile:water+0.1% TFA, reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin. A hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to a nanoACQUITY™ UPLC (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) was used at a flow rate of 1 μL/minute with a one hour gradient (solvent A: water+0.1% formic acid; solvent B: acetonitrile+0.1% formic acid). The instrument was calibrated and tuned using tryptically digested synthetic tetraubiquitin (Boston Biochem) to validate optimum charge states for targeted analysis studies. The determined m/z for the K48-linked polyubiquitin were 487.6, 730.89, and 1460.78, and the determined m/z for the K63-linked polyubiquitin were 561.80, 748.73, and 1122.6. After tryptic digestion, reverse phase separation and targeted tandem mass spectrometry the ion chromatograms for the K48 and K63 polyubiquitin peptides were extracted and the peak area was calculated to infer concentration.\n\n\nThe results of the immunoprecipitation analyses are set forth in \nFIGS. 7A and 7B\n. As shown in \nFIG. 7A\n, the mixture of the three affinity-matured anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies specifically immunoprecipitated K63-linked polyubiquitinated proteins. The results in \nFIG. 7B\n show that the anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies are not cross-reactive for K48-linked polyubiquitin peptides (whereas for comparison the K48-linked polyubiquitin antibody shows substantial enrichment for the K48-linked polyubiquitin peptides).\n\n\nIn further mass spectrometry experiments, polyubiquitinated proteins were immunoprecipitated from human BJAB cells as described above, and then resolved by SDS-PAGE using standard methods. The immunoprecipitated gel-resolved proteins were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and then analyzed using a variation of the ubiquitin-AQUA method (Kirkpatrick et al., Nat. Cell Biol. 8: 700-710 (2006)). Briefly, the trypsin digests were supplemented with isotope-labeled internal standard peptides representing each polyubiquitin chain linkage and unbranched ubiquitin, and then the standards plus their corresponding native analytes were detected in high-resolution precursor ion scans using narrow range-extracted ion chromatograms (Crosas et al., Cell 127: 1401-1413 (2006)). The abundance of each polyubiquitin chain linkage and the total amount of ubiquitin in the BJAB immunoprecipitates was quantified by comparing the signal from each digested peptide relative to its corresponding internal standard. Specifically, BJAB cells were cultured in spinner flasks in the high-glucose version of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 μM L-asparagine, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells (>10\n9\n) were washed in PBS and lysed for 30 minutes at room temperature in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 135 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) containing 6 M urea, 2 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and then the lysate was diluted to 4 M urea with lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, 2 mM NEM and 1 mM DTT. After preclearing with Protein A-sepharose (GE Healthcare) for one hour, the lysate was divided into three samples that received 30 μg of either Apu3.A8 anti-K63 (in IgG format), Apu2.07 anti-K48 (in IgG format), or isotype control antibody (anti-Her2). Samples were incubated at room temperature for two hours and subsequently centrifuged to remove precipitated material. Further antibody (10 μg) was added to the soluble lysate as well as Protein A-sepharose and samples were incubated at room temperature overnight. The sepharose beads were washed extensively in lysis buffer, then in PBS. The beads were eluted in reducing SDS sample buffer, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and then resolved by SDS-PAGE in 4-20% Tris glycine gels (Invitrogen). All areas of the gel (except for the 25 and 55 kDa regions representing the heavy and light chains from the precipitating antibodies) were excised, crushed, washed in 25 mM NH\n4\nHCO\n3 \nin 50:50 acetonitrile:water and dehydrated. The gel was then rehydrated in 25 mM NH\n4\nHCO\n3 \ncontaining trypsin (Promega) and incubated overnight at 37° C. The reaction was quenched by addition of 0.008% TFA. Peptides were extracted in 5% acetic acid and then twice in 100% acetonitrile. These samples were spiked with AQUA peptide standards (1 pmol) and injected via an auto-sampler for separation by reverse phase chromatography on a NanoAcquity HPLC system (Waters). Peptides loaded onto a pre-column (5 μm Symmetry® C18, 180×20 mm) were separated using an analytical column (1.7 μm BEH-130 \nC18 column\n 100×100 mm (Waters)) with a flow rate of 1 μL per minute and a gradient of 2% solvent B to 90% Solvent V (where Solvent A is water+0.1% formic acid and solvent B is 100% acetonitrile+0.1% formic acid) applied over 70 minutes with a total analysis time of 90 minutes. Peptides were eluted directly into a nanospray ionization source with a spray voltage of 2 kV and were analyzed using an LTQ XL-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher). Precursor ions were analyzed in the FTMS at 60,000 resolution. Quantitation was performed by comparing peak areas for the heavy and light version of each peptide, extracting the ion chromatograms at 10 ppm mass accuracy to 4 decimal places.\n\n\nMuRF1 autoubiquitination reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boston Biochem). For immunoprecipitations, samples were diluted 100-fold in lysis buffer containing 4 M urea, precleared with Protein A-sepharose, and then immunoprecipitated overnight with antibody (20 μg) and Protein A-sepharose. Total ubiquitin was blotted with P4D1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). MuRF1 samples analyzed by mass spectrometry were resolved on an Agilent 1100 LC module with a 15 minute gradient from 5% solvent B to 30% Solvent B and a total analysis time of 30 minutes. Ion chromatograms were created by extracting a window ±15 ppm from the expected m/z.\n\n\nAnti-K48-linked polyubiquitin antibody Apu2.07, the anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibody Apu3.A8 and an isotype control antibody recognizing Her2 immunoprecipitated 49.1 pmol, 2.2 pmol and 0.2 μmol of total ubiquitin, respectively (\nFIG. 7C\n). This result was in keeping with the observation that K48-linked polyubiquitin chains were more abundant than K63-linked polyubiquitin chains in the input lysate used for the immunoprecipitations (\nFIG. 7D\n). Direct examination of the polyubiquitin linkages immunoprecipitated by the anti-K48 antibody revealed 12.7 pmol of K48-GG signature peptide and residual amounts of the signature peptides for certain other linkages (0.1 pmol K63, 1.1 pmol K11, and 2.0 pmol K6) (\nFIG. 7E\n). Similarly, polyubiquitin chains immunoprecipitated by the anti-K63 linked polyubiquitin antibody Apu3.A8 mainly produced the K63-GG signature peptide (0.3 pmol K63), and lesser amounts of other linkage peptides (0.18 pmol K48, 0.08 pmol K11, and 0.06 pmol K6) (\nFIG. 7F\n). Given the strong binding preferences seen for the anti-polyubiquitin antibodies by surface plasmon resonance, these mass spectrometry results suggest that a significant fraction of cellular substrates modified by ubiquitin exhibit heterogeneous polyubiquitin chain linkages.\n\n\nTo confirm that these “off-target” linkages immunoprecipitated from BJAB cell lysates were derived from substrates bearing heterogeneous polyubiquitin chains, as opposed to non-specific binding, the necessity of the target linkage for immunoprecipitation of the “off target” linkages was investigated. Mixed linkage polyubiquitin chains lacking either the K48 or the K63 linkage were generated in vitro using E3 MuRFI in combination with the promiscuous E2 enzyme UbCH5c (Kim et al. J. Biol. Chem. 282: 17375-17386 (2007)). The K48 or K63 linkage was excluded from the MuRFI autoubiquitination reactions using mutant ubiquitin that had either K48 or K63 mutated to arginine (\nFIG. 7G\n). By western blotting with a pan-ubiquitin antibody, MuRF-1 autoubiquitination reactions produced high molecular weight smears irrespective of whether wild-type, K48R, or K63R ubiquitin was used (\nFIG. 7H\n, \n \nlanes\n \n 1, 5, and 9). Ubiquitin-AQUA analysis of the reaction with wild-type ubiquitin revealed three main linkages: K48, K63, and K11 (\nFIG. 7I\n, lane 1). As expected, reactions performed with K48R ubiquitin lacked K48-linked polyubiquitin chains (\nFIG. 7I\n, lane 9). Both the anti-K48-linked and anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies immunoprecipitated polyubiquitinated species when MuRF1 was modified with wild-type ubiquitin (\nFIG. 7H\n, lanes 3-4), but each antibody failed to do so if the target linkage for which it was specific was absent (\nFIG. 7H\n, \nlanes\n 7 and 12). An isotype-matched control antibody (anti-HER2) did not immunoprecipitate ubiquitinated MuRFI from any of the reactions (\nFIG. 7H\n, \n \nlanes\n \n 2, 6, and 10). Ubiquitin-AQUA analysis of the immunoprecipitated species form the wild-type Ub reaction demonstrated the presence of K48-, K63-, and K11-linked chains regardless of the antibody used for enrichment (\nFIG. 7J\n, \nlane\n 3 and \nFIG. 7K\n, lane 4). As predicted by Western blotting (\nFIG. 7H\n, \nlanes\n 7 and 12), K11-linked chains were immunoprecipitated by both the anti-K48-linked and the anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies only if their target linkage was also present (\nFIGS. 7J and 7K\n). These results demonstrated that the anti-K48-linked and anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies retain their fidelity in the context of immunoprecipitation. Further, they indicate that alternative linkages immunoprecipitated from cells by the anti-K48-linked and anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies must stem from individual substrates bearing both target and off-target linkages.\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nUbiquitination Pathway Detection Using Affinity-Matured Antibodies\n\n\nA number of cellular pathways have been identified that are regulated by polyubiquitination of key proteins. The affinity-matured anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention were used to determine the extent of K63-linked polyubiquitination of particular proteins in the cell, helping to elucidate cellular signaling pathways where ubiquitination with K63-linked polyubiquitin plays a role.\n\n\n(A) TNFα Activation of TNFR1\n\n\nTNFα activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) leads to RIP and TRAF2 association (see \nFIG. 8A\n). TRAF2 adds K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to RIP which allows recruitment of TAK1/TAB2/TAB3 and subsequent activation of the NFκB signaling pathway (see Wertz et al., Nature (2004) 430: 694-699). Downregulation of signaling through this pathway occurs by the deubiquitinase A20 removing the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on RIP and replacing them with K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, targeting RIP to the proteasome for degradation. The affinity matured anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention were used to assess the degree and type of polyubiquitination of RIP during various perturbations of the pathway.\n\n\nBriefly, HeLa S3 cells were treated with 21 μM MG-132 for ten minutes. The cells were subsequently treated with 100 ng/mL TNF from 0 to 25 minutes. At each timepoint, the cells were pelleted and washed once with PBS. The washed pellet was lysed in 20 mL TNFR1 immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM EDTA) including protease inhibitors, 25 μM MG-132, 10 mM N-ethyl maleimide (NEM), and 50 mM NaF for 10 minutes at 4° C. with rotation. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000×g for 5 minutes. The cleared lysate was incubated with 200 μL Protein A beads for one hour at 4° C. with rotation. Beads and debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 5 minutes. Samples were taken from each timepoint lysate for western blot analysis as described above. For immunoprecipitation samples, 20 μL anti-TNFR1 antibody was added to each sample, and the samples were rotated at 4° C. for 2.5 hours. 200 μL unblocked protein A beads were added to each sample, and the samples were again rotated at 4° C. for 2.5 hours. The beads were washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer, twice in immunoprecipitation buffer including 1 M NaCl, and twice in immunoprecipitation buffer. Proteins specifically bound to the beads were recovered by treatment with ubiquitin chain lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 135 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol) containing 6 M urea and gentle agitation for 15 minutes at room temperature. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation. Supernatants were diluted 25-fold with ubiquitin chain lysis buffer including protease inhibitors, 10 mM NEM and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, followed by preclearing with 50 μL Protein A beads+10 μg Herceptin for 2 hours. Anti-K48-linked polyubiquitin antibodies and anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibodies (1:1 mixture of Apu3.A8 and Apu3.B3) were pre-coupled to protein A beads for 3 hours at 4° C. Immunoprecipitation reaction samples were combined with one of the precoupled antibodies and rotated for 2 hours at 4° C., followed by washing in lysis buffer and the addition of sample buffer. Samples were reduced and alkylated and run on 4-12% Tris/Gly 1.5 mm 15-well Novex gels, followed by transfer, immunoblotting, and western blot analysis according to the procedures described above in Example 2.\n\n\nA simplified form of the known RIP modification pathway is shown schematically in \nFIG. 9B\n. Treatment of HeLa S3 cells with TNFα stimulates K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIP, which is in a complex with TNFR1. A two-stage immunoprecipitation (first immunoprecipitating the TNFR1 complex, then immunoprecipitating K48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins, or K63-linked polyubiquitinated proteins) permitted an analysis of the ubiquitination state of RIP upon TNFα treatment. As depicted in \nFIG. 9A\n, RIP protein quickly associates with TNFR1 within the first five minutes of TNFα treatment, and the amount of associated RIP remains constant regardless of the time of TNFα treatment thereafter (blot 4). The RIP that is initially associated with TNFR1 is K63-linked polyubiquitinated, but longer treatment with TNFα leads to chain editing, resulting in K48-linked polyubiquitinated RIP (compare \nblots\n 6 and 7). Thus the ability to discriminate between RIP bearing a K63-linked polyubiquitin label versus RIP bearing a K48-linked polyubiquitin label provides important information about a cellular pathway triggered by TNFα, and the affinity-matured antibodies of the invention provide a convenient and useful tool for examining this RIP-mediated pathway without performing mass spectrometry or other biophysical analyses.\n\n\n(B) Polyubiquitin Chain Editing of IRAK1\n\n\nGiven that the kinase RIP1 is modified sequentially by K63- and then K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, the latter being conferred by the E3 deubiquitinase A20, and that A20 is also a known negative regulator of signaling by certain TLRs (Boone et al. Nat. Immunol. 5: 1052-1060 (2004)), other kinase adaptors recruited to TLRs and the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) were investigated for regulation in a similar fashion. IRAK1 was a potential candidate for undergoing polyubiquitin chain editing because post-translationally modified IRAK is recruited rapidly to activated receptor complexes and subsequently is degraded (Yamin and Miller J. Biol. Chem. 272: 21540-21547 (1997)). 293 cells stably expressing IL-1R and IL1R-AcP were treated with 25 μM MG-132 just prior to the addition of 10 ng/mL IL-1β (eBIoscience). Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in IRAK IP buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM NaF, 2 mM DTT, and 0.5% Triton X-100) containing 6 M urea. Soluble lysates were diluted approximately 20-fold in lysis buffer and immunoprecipitations with either anti-K48-linked polyubiquitin antibody Apu2.07 or a 1: mix of anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibody Apu3.A8 and Apu3.B3 were performed as described above in Example 3(A) for RIP1. The IRAK1 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.\n\n\nUpon treatment with IL-1β, cells stably expressing the IL-1R revealed a smear of modified IRAK1 within two minutes (\nFIG. 10A\n). The slower-migrating forms of IRAK1 were more abundant at 10 minutes and could be converted to the unmodified form of IRAK1 by Usp2 in an NEM-sensitive manner. These results suggested that the higher molecular weight forms of IRAK1 are due to ubiquitination. The appearance of ubiquitinated IRAK1 coincided with activation of downstream NF-κB signaling as evidenced by IκBα degradation (\nFIG. 10B\n). At different times after treatment with IL-1β, cell lysates were prepared in 6 M urea and immunoprecipitated with linkage-specific polyubiquitin antibodies prior to Western blotting for IRAK1 (\nFIG. 10C\n). IRAK1 modified with K63-linked polyubiquitin chains was detected at 5 minutes after IL-1β treatment and was maximal by 30-60 minutes post treatment, mirroring the timing of appearance of the high molecular weight IRAK1 smear (compare the upper panel of \nFIG. 10B\n with the lower panel of \nFIG. 10C\n). The amount of K48-linked polyubiquitin evident on IRAK1 peaked at 90-150 minutes, after which time the intensity of the total IRAK1 signal began to subside. When cells were treated with IL-1β in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, this degradation of ubiquitinated IRAK1 was inhibited (\nFIG. 10D\n), consistent with the K48-linked polyubiquitin chains targeting IRAK1 for proteasomal degradation. Thus polyubiquitin chain editing of IRAK1 in cells treated with IL-1β resembles that of RIP1 in cells treated with TNF and this process of polyubiquitin chain editing may represent a general mechanism of terminating downstream signaling events. As described above for RIP, the ability to discriminate between IRAK1 bearing a K63-linked polyubiquitin label versus IRAK1 bearing a K48-linked polyubiquitin label provides important information about a cellular pathway triggered by IL-1β (see \nFIG. 8B\n), and the affinity-matured antibodies of the invention provide a convenient and useful tool for examining this IRAK1-mediated pathway without performing mass spectrometry or other biophysical analyses.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nCrystal Structure of Apu3.A8 in Complex with K63dUB\n\n\nTo understand the structural consequences of the observed affinity and specificity improvements in Apu3.A8, the Fab fragment was crystallized in complex with K63-linked diubiquitin and the structure was solved to 2.6 Å resolution (\nFIG. 2C\n). Briefly, the Fab fragment of Apu3.A8 was expressed in \nE. coli\n, purified using Protein G-sepharose, and eluted with 0.58% acetic acid. Fab-containing fractions were purified using an SP HiTrap column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mM MES pH 5.5 and eluted with an NaCl gradient. The protein was further purified by passing it over an S-200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl. K63-linked diubiquitin was produced by incubating 4.1 mM ubiquitin (K63R and D77), 0.1 μM E1 (Boston Biochem), and 20 μM E2 (UbcH13/Uev1a for K63) (Boston Biochem) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM DTT, 2.5 mM ATP overnight at 37° C. (see, e.g., Pickart and Raasi, Meth. Enzymol. 399: 21-36 (2005)). Diubiquitin was purified using a MonoS cation exchange column in a NaCl gradient and 20 mM MES pH 5.5, and then concentrated to 0.5 mg/mL. Diubiquitin-Fab complexes were prepared from 3-fold molar excess of Fab with diubiquitin. The protein complex was purified over a Superdex 75 column in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl. Complex fractions were pooled and concentrated to 17 mg/mL for crystallization screening trials. Crystals of K63R diubiquitin-Apu3.A8 (90 μm×90 μm×150 μm) grew after two weeks at 18° C. in sitting drops from 1:1 mixtures of protein (17 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl) and well solution (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1.6 M LiSO\n4\n). Crystals were cryoprotected using well solution with the addition of 30% glycerol. Crystallographic data was collected at SSRL beamline 7-1 (Table D) and was processed with HKL (HKL). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program PHASER (CCP4) followed by refinement with REFMAC5 (CCP4). The Apu3.A8 complex was solved using the refined Apu2.16 complex as a search model (see \nFIG. 2A\n and US Patent Publication No. US2007-0218069) (\nFIGS. 2C and 2D\n).

Excluding differences in the conformation of CDR L3 and the N-terminal strand of the light chain, both of which are attributable to differences in crystal packing, the structure of the A8 Fab is virtually identical to the structure of the parental A16 Fab (rmsd 0.08 Å on 412 C-α atoms). Both structures were compared to the Fv region of the humanized anti-HER2 antibody 4D5 (\nFIG. 2D\n). The conformation of L1 and the N-termini of the three Fabs differ considerably. The C-alpha atom of T5 is displaced by 14 Angstroms between the structures of either Apu2.16 or Apu3.A8 and humanized 4D5, despite identical sequences among the three structures in these regions. The conformation and sequence of L3 differs considerably as well. These differences combined to affect the position of Q90 in Apu3.A8 such that it occupies the space normally occupied by the N-terminal strand, resulting in displacement of this strand with concomitant rearrangement of L1. Comparison of the structure of K63 diubiquitin in the above co-crystal structure that of a crystal structure of K63-diubiquitin alone (pdb code 2JF5) or to either the crystal or solution structures of K48 diubiquitin (Cook et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 16467-16471 (1992); Varadan et al., J. Mol. Biol. 324: 637-647 (2002)) demonstrates that the Fabs recognize a specific conformation of diubiquitin that is unique to the K63 linkage.\n\n\nSurprisingly, neither R52 in L2 nor T52 in H2 is in intimate contact with the diubiquitin, and neither residue contributes much to the ubiquitin-binding surface on Apu3.A8. Instead, the effect of these two mutations appears to be driven largely by improved electrostatic compatibility between the surface of the K63-acceptor ubiquitin and the light chain (\nFIG. 2E\n). In the Apu3.A8 light chain, R52 (which was introduced in Apu3.A8) and R66 contribute to a positive region that is in close proximity to a negatively charged region on the ubiquitin surface, created in part by residues D21, D58, and E18 from the K63-acceptor ubiquitin.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nLocalization of Polyubiquitin Chains within Cells\n\n\nThe preceding experiments demonstrate that the affinity-matured antibodies of the invention are capable of sensitive and specific detection of K63-linked polyubiquitinated proteins in the context of a western blot, are able to specifically immunoprecipitate K63-linked polyubiquitinated proteins from cellular lysates, and can be used to assist in the elucidation of cellular pathways involving K63-linked polyubiquitination of one or more proteins. Further experiments were performed to ascertain the ability of the antibodies be used in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy for visualization of polyubiquitinated species within cells, and where any such detected proteins localize. HeLa cells grown in 2-well chamber slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 minutes, rinsed twice with PBS, and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes. After blocking in Earle's balanced salt solution supplemented with 10% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% saponin for one hour, cells were labeled overnight at 4° C. with 1 μg/mL Apu2.07 anti-K48, 1 μg/mL Apu3.A8 anti-K63, or 5 μg/mL PW8155 anti-proteasome antibodies (Biomol International) in blocking solution. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and then incubated with 4 drops of Image-IT Fx signal enhancer (Invitrogen) for 15 minutes. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, then stained for 1 hour with Cy2-conjugated anti-human and Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in blocking solution. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, rinsed twice with water, and then mounted with ProLong Gold™ containing DAPI (Invitrogen) and a 1.5 mm coverslip. Cells were examined under an \nAxioplan\n 2 light microscope (Zeiss) and images were recorded with a CoolSNAP\nHQ \nCCD camera (Photometrics) controlled by SlideBook™ software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). In addition, Z-series images were acquired and analyzed by deconvolution microscopy, using SlideBook™ or AutoQuant™ (Media Cybernetics) software (data not shown). To confirm the localization of the signal, samples were also examined with an LSM510 META laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss). All of the images presented are single-capture wide-field fluorescent micrographs.\n\n\nThe results are shown in \nFIG. 11\n. The anti-K48-linked polyubiquitin antibody Apu2.07 stained both the nucleus and cytoplasm of HeLa cells, but did not label nucleoli (\nFIG. 11A\n). This pattern of staining coincided almost completely with proteasomes labeled with a polyclonal antibody recognizing the core 20S subunits (\nFIGS. 11B\n and C), consistent with the idea that K48-linked polyubiquitin chains generally target proteins for proteasomal degradation. K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, but not proteasomes, were detected at the midbody during mitosis. In contrast, HeLa cells stained with the anti-K63-linked polyubiquitin antibody Apu3.A8 labeled cytoplasmic speckles that varied both in number and size between individual cells (\nFIG. 1\n ID). No co-localization of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains with proteasomes was detected in those speckles (\nFIGS. 11E\n and F). In control experiments, staining by the linkage-specific antibodies could be competed by synthesized polyubiquitin chains only if the target linkage was present (data not shown). These results indicate that K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains can occur in distinct subcellular regions, and that antibodies Apu2.07 and Apu3.A8 are able to detect K48-linked or K63-linked polyubiquitin in indirect immunofluorescence assays."

The invention further relates to diagnostic, prognostic, prophylactic and therapeutic methods and compositions useful in the treatment of cancers that express PSCA.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCancer is the second leading cause of human death next to coronary disease. Worldwide, millions of people die from cancer every year. In the United States alone, as reported by the American Cancer Society, cancer causes the death of well over a half-million people annually, with over 1.2 million new cases diagnosed per year. While deaths from heart disease have been declining significantly, those resulting from cancer generally are on the rise. In the early part of the next century, cancer is predicted to become the leading cause of death.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWorldwide, several cancers stand out as the leading killers. In particular, carcinomas of the lung, prostate, breast, colon, pancreas, ovary, and bladder represent the primary causes of cancer death. These and virtually all other carcinomas share a common lethal feature. With very few exceptions, metastatic disease from a carcinoma is fatal. Moreover, even for those cancer patients who initially survive their primary cancers, common experience has shown that their lives are dramatically altered. Many cancer patients experience strong anxieties driven by the awareness of the potential for recurrence or treatment failure. Many cancer patients experience physical debilitations following treatment. Furthermore, many cancer patients experience a recurrence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWorldwide, prostate cancer is the fourth most prevalent cancer in men. In North America and Northern Europe, it is by far the most common cancer in males and is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. In the United States alone, well over 30,000 men die annually of this disease - second only to lung cancer. Despite the magnitude of these figures, there is still no effective treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Surgical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, hormone ablation therapy, surgical castration and chemotherapy continue to be the main treatment modalities. Unfortunately, these treatments are ineffective for many and are often associated with undesirable consequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the diagnostic front, the lack of a prostate tumor marker that can accurately detect early-stage, localized tumors remains a significant limitation in the diagnosis and management of this disease. Although the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) assay has been a very useful tool, however its specificity and general utility is widely regarded as lacking in several important respects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProgress in identifying additional specific markers for prostate cancer has been improved by the generation of prostate cancer xenografts that can recapitulate different stages of the disease in mice. The LAPC (Los Angeles Prostate Cancer) xenografts are prostate cancer xenografts that have survived passage in severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice and have exhibited the capacity to mimic the transition from androgen dependence to androgen independence (\nKlein et al., 1997, Nat. Med. 3:402\n). More recently identified prostate cancer markers include PCTA-1 (\nSu et al., 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93: 7252\n), prostate-specific membrane (PSM) antigen (\nPinto et al., Clin Cancer Res 1996 Sep 2 (9): 1445-51\n), STEAP (\nHubert, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Dec 7; 96(25): 14523-8\n) and prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) (\nReiter et al., 1998, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95: 1735\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile previously identified markers such as PSA, PSM, PCTA and PSCA have facilitated efforts to diagnose and treat prostate cancer, there is need for the identification of additional markers and therapeutic targets for prostate and related cancers in order to further improve diagnosis and therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 3 percent of adult malignancies. Once adenomas reach a diameter of 2 to 3 cm, malignant potential exists. In the adult, the two principal malignant renal tumors are renal cell adenocarcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis or ureter. The incidence of renal cell adenocarcinoma is estimated at more than 29,000 cases in the United States, and more than 11,600 patients died of this disease in 1998. Transitional cell carcinoma is less frequent, with an incidence of approximately 500 cases per year in the United States.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurgery has been the primary therapy for renal cell adenocarcinoma for many decades. Until recently, metastatic disease has been refractory to any systemic therapy. With recent developments in systemic therapies, particularly immunotherapies, metastatic renal cell carcinoma may be approached aggressively in appropriate patients with a possibility of durable responses. Nevertheless, there is a remaining need for effective therapies for these patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf all new cases of cancer in the United States, bladder cancer represents approximately 5 percent in men (fifth most common neoplasm) and 3 percent in women (eighth most common neoplasm). The incidence is increasing slowly, concurrent with an increasing older population. In 1998, there was an estimated 54,500 cases, including 39,500 in men and 15,000 in women. The age-adjusted incidence in the United States is 32 per 100,000 for men and eight per 100,000 in women. The historic male/female ratio of 3:1 may be decreasing related to smoking patterns in women. There were an estimated 11,000 deaths from bladder cancer in 1998 (7,800 in men and 3,900 in women). Bladder cancer incidence and morality strongly increase with age and will be an increasing problem as the population becomes more elderly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost bladder cancers recur in the bladder. Bladder cancer is managed with a combination of transurethral resection of the bladder (TUR) and intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy. The multifocal and recurrent nature of bladder cancer points out the limitations of TUR. Most muscle-invasive cancers are not cured by TUR alone. Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion is the most effective means to eliminate the cancer but carry an undeniable impact on urinary and sexual function. There continues to be a significant need for treatment modalities that are beneficial for bladder cancer patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn estimated 130,200 cases of colorectal cancer occurred in 2000 in the United States, including 93,800 cases of colon cancer and 36,400 of rectal cancer. Colorectal cancers are the third most common cancers in men and women. Incidence rates declined significantly during 1992-1996 (-2.1% per year). Research suggests that these declines have been due to increased screening and polyp removal, preventing progression of polyps to invasive cancers. There were an estimated 56,300 deaths (47,700 from colon cancer, 8,600 from rectal cancer) in 2000, accounting for about 11% of all U.S. cancer deaths.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt present, surgery is the most common form of therapy for colorectal cancer, and for cancers that have not spread, it is frequently curative. Chemotherapy, or chemotherapy plus radiation, is given before or after surgery to most patients whose cancer has deeply perforated the bowel wall or has spread to the lymph nodes. A permanent colostomy (creation of an abdominal opening for elimination of body wastes) is occasionally needed for colon cancer and is infrequently required for rectal cancer. There continues to be a need for effective diagnostic and treatment modalities for colorectal cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere were an estimated 164,100 new cases of lung and bronchial cancer in 2000, accounting for 14% of all U.S. cancer diagnoses. The incidence rate of lung and bronchial cancer is declining significantly in men, from a high of 86.5 per 100,000 in 1984 to 70.0 in 1996. In the 1990s, the rate of increase among women began to slow. In 1996, the incidence rate in women was 42.3 per 100,000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLung and bronchial cancer caused an estimated 156,900 deaths in 2000, accounting for 28% of all cancer deaths. During 1992-1996, mortality from lung cancer declined significantly among men (-1.7% per year) while rates for women were still significantly increasing (0.9% per year). Since 1987, more women have died each year of lung cancer than breast cancer, which, for over 40 years, was the major cause of cancer death in women. Decreasing lung cancer incidence and mortality rates most likely resulted from decreased smoking rates over the previous 30 years; however, decreasing smoking patterns among women lag behind those of men. Of concern, although the declines in adult tobacco use have slowed, tobacco use in youth is increasing again.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment options for lung and bronchial cancer are determined by the type and stage of the cancer and include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. For many localized cancers, surgery is usually the treatment of choice. Because the disease has usually spread by the time it is discovered, radiation therapy and chemotherapy are often needed in combination with surgery. Chemotherapy alone or combined with radiation is the treatment of choice for small cell lung cancer; on this regimen, a large percentage of patients experience remission, which in some cases is long lasting. There is however, an ongoing need for effective treatment and diagnostic approaches for lung and bronchial cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn estimated 182,800 new invasive cases of breast cancer were expected to occur among women in the United States during 2000. Additionally, about 1,400 new cases of breast cancer were expected to be diagnosed in men in 2000. After increasing about 4% per year in the 1980s, breast cancer incidence rates in women have leveled off in the 1990s to about 110.6 cases per 100,000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the U.S. alone, there were an estimated 41,200 deaths (40,800 women, 400 men) in 2000 due to breast cancer. Breast cancer ranks second among cancer deaths in women. According to the most recent data, mortality rates declined significantly during 1992-1996 with the largest decreases in younger women, both white and black. These decreases were probably the result of earlier detection and improved treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaking into account the medical circumstances and the patient's preferences, treatment of breast cancer may involve lumpectomy (local removal of the tumor) and removal of the lymph nodes under the arm; mastectomy (surgical removal of the breast) and removal of the lymph nodes under the arm; radiation therapy; chemotherapy; or hormone therapy. Often, two or more methods are used in combination. Numerous studies have shown that, for early stage disease, long-term survival rates after lumpectomy plus radiotherapy are similar to survival rates after modified radical mastectomy. Significant advances in reconstruction techniques provide several options for breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Recently, such reconstruction has been done at the same time as the mastectomy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLocal excision of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with adequate amounts of surrounding normal breast tissue may prevent the local recurrence of the DCIS. Radiation to the breast and/or tamoxifen may reduce the chance of DCIS occurring in the remaining breast tissue. This is important because DCIS, if left untreated, may develop into invasive breast cancer. Nevertheless, there are serious side effects or sequelae to these treatments. There is, therefore, a need for efficacious breast cancer treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere were an estimated 23,100 new cases of ovarian cancer in the United States in 2000. It accounts for 4% of all cancers among women and ranks second among gynecologic cancers. During 1992-1996, ovarian cancer incidence rates were significantly declining. Consequent to ovarian cancer, there were an estimated 14,000 deaths in 2000. Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are treatment options for ovarian cancer. Surgery usually includes the removal of one or both ovaries, the fallopian tubes (salpingo-oophorectomy), and the uterus (hysterectomy). In some very early tumors, only the involved ovary will be removed, especially in young women who wish to have children. In advanced disease, an attempt is made to remove all intra-abdominal disease to enhance the effect of chemotherapy. There continues to be an important need for effective treatment options for ovarian cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere were an estimated 28,300 new cases of pancreatic cancer in the United States in 2000. Over the past 20 years, rates of pancreatic cancer have declined in men. Rates among women have remained approximately constant but may be beginning to decline. Pancreatic cancer caused an estimated 28,200 deaths in 2000 in the United States. Over the past 20 years, there has been a slight but significant decrease in mortality rates among men (about -0.9% per year) while rates have increased slightly among women.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are treatment options for pancreatic cancer. These treatment options can extend survival and/or relieve symptoms in many patients but are not likely to produce a cure for most. There is a significant need for additional therapeutic and diagnostic options for cancers. These include the use of antibodies, vaccines, and small molecules as treatment modalities. Additionally, there is also a need to use these modilities as research tools to diagnose, detect, monitor, and further the state of the art in all areas of cancer treatment and studies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic utility of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (\nG. Kohler and C. Milstein, Nature 256:495-497 (1975\n)) is being realized. Monoclonal antibodies have now been approved as therapies in transplantation, cancer, infectious disease, cardiovascular disease and inflammation. Different isotypes have different effector functions. Such differences in function are reflected in distinct 3-dimensional structures for the various immunoglobulin isotypes (\nP.M. Alzari et al., Annual Rev. Immunol., 6:555-580 (1988\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause mice are convenient for immunization and recognize most human antigens as foreign, mAbs against human targets with therapeutic potential have typically been of murine origin. However, murine mAbs have inherent disadvantages as human therapeutics. They require more frequent dosing as mAbs have a shorter circulating half-life in humans than human antibodies. More critically, the repeated administration of murine antibodies to the human immune system causes the human immune system to respond by recognizing the mouse protein as a foreign and generating a human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response. Such a HAMA response may result in allergic reaction and the rapid clearing of the murine antibody from the system thereby rendering the treatment by murine antibody useless. To avoid such affects, attempts to create human immune systems within mice have been attempted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInitial attempts hoped to create transgenic mice capable of responding to antigens with antibodies having human sequences (See \nBruggemann et al., Proc. Nat'1. Acad. Sci. USA 86:6709-6713 (1989\n)), but were limited by the amount of DNA that could be stably maintained by available cloning vehicles. The use of yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) cloning vectors led the way to introducing large germline fragments of human Ig locus into transgenic mammals. Essentially a majority of the human V, D, and J region genes arranged with the same spacing found in the human genome and the human constant regions were introduced into mice using YACs. One such transgenic mouse strain is known as XenoMouse(r) mice and is commercially available from Abgenix, Inc. (Fremont CA).\n\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides antibodies as well as binding fragments thereof and molecules engineered therefrom, that bind to PSCA proteins and polypeptide fragments of PSCA proteins.

Expression of PSCA protein in recombinant murine, rat and human cell lines, The indicated murine, rat, and human cell lines were infected with retroviruses carrying the human PSCA cDNA and a neomycin resistance gene or control virus with only the neomycin resistance gene. Stable recombinant cell lines were selected in the presence of G418. PSCA expression was determined by FACS staining with the 1G8 anti-PSCA MAb (5 ug/ml). Shown is the FACS profile of each cell line demonstrating a fluorescent shift only in the PSCA infected line indicative of cell surface PSCA expression. These lines are useful in MAb development as immunogens, MAb screening reagents, and in functional assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6\n.

Shown is an SDS-PAGE Coomasie blue stained gel of the glutathione eluted fractions containing GST-PSCA. Indicated are the intact GST-PSCA fusion protein and a minor degradation product containing GST. This protein is useful as a MAb and pAb immunogen and as an Ab screening reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 9\n. Screening for human PSCA antibodies by FACS. Antibody concentration from supernatants was determined by ELISA. 50ul/well of (neat) was added to 96-well FACS plates and serially diluted. PSCA-expressing cells were added (endogenous or recombinant, 50,000 cells/well) and the mixture incubated at 4°C for two hours. Following incubation, the cells were washed with FACS Buffer and further incubated with 100ul of detection antibody (anti-hIgG-PE) for 45 minutes at 4°C. At the end of incubation, the cells were washed with FACS Buffer, fixed with formaldehyde and analyzed using FACScan. Data were analyzed using CellQuest Pro software. Solid histograms represent data from negative control cells and open histograms indicate data from PSCA-positive cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 10\n. Relative affinity ranking of PSCA MAbs by FACS. 21 serial 1:2 dilutions of each PSCA antibody was incubated with SW780 cells (50,000 cells per well) over night at 4°C (final MAb concentrations ranged from 40nM to 0.038pM). At the end of the incubation, cells were washed and incubated with anti-hIgG-PE detection antibody. After washing the unbound secondary antibodies, the cells were analyzed by FACS and the mean fluorescence intensity of each point obtained using CellQuest Pro software. Affinity was calculated withGraphpad Prism software using a Sigmoidal Dose-Response (variable slope) equation. A representative FACS analysis depicting the binding titration for PSCA MAb 4,121 is presented in the figure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 11\n.

Two days following transfection, cells were harvested and stained with either human anti-PSCA MAb Ha1-4.117 or murine MAb 1G8 (5 ug/ml). Shown is the FACS profile demonstrating that MAb Ha1-4.117 raised to the human PSCA protein binds to both murine and simian PSCA protein expressed in 293T cells. The murine 1G8 MAb binds to simian PSCA but not to murine PSCA. Such results demonstrate the ability to select MAbs that crossreact with antigen from other species. Crossreacting MAbs will be useful for studying expression and toxicity in those species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 12\n. Internalization of PSCA following incubation with Mab 4.121, PSCA MAb 4.121 was incubated with PC3-PSCA cells at 4°C for 90 min to allow binding of the antibodies to the cell surface. The cells were then split into two aliquots and incubated at either 37°C (to allow antibody internalization) or \nt\n 4°C (control no internalization). Following incuabation at 37°C or 4°C , the remaining PSCA MAb 4.121 bound to the cell surface was removed with an acid wash. Subsequent permeablization and incubation with a secondary detection antibody allowed detection of internalized PSCA MAb 4.121. Cells were analyzed using FACS or observed under the fluorescence microscope. Approximately 30% of PSCA Mab 4.121 was internalized after incubation at 37°C for two hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 13\n. Antibodies to PSCA mediate saporin dependent killing in PSCA expressing cells. B300.19 cells (750 cells/well) were seeded into a 96 well plate on \nday\n 1. The following day an equal volume of medium containing a 2X concentration of the indicated primary antibody together with a 2 fold excess of anti-human (Hum-Zap) or anti-goat (Goat-Zap) polyclonal antibody conjugated with saporin toxin (Advanced Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA) was added to each well. The cells were allowed to incubate for 5 days at 37 degrees C. At the end of the incubation period, MTS (Promega) was added to each well and incubation continued for an additional 4 hours. The OD at 450 nM was determined. The results in \nFigure 13(A)\n show that PSCA antibodies HA1-4.121 and HA1-4.117 mediated saporin dependent cytotoxicity in B300.19-PSCA cells while a control, nonspecific IgG\n1\n antibody, had no effect. The results in \nFigure 13(B)\n show that the addition of a secondary saporin conjugated antibody that did not recognize human Fc, failed to mediate cytotoxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 14\n. Complement mediated cytotoxicity of PSCA Mabs. PSCA antibodies (0-50 µg/ml) were diluted with RHB buffer (RPMI 1640, Gibco Life Technologies, 20 mM HEPES). B300.19-PSCA expressing cells were washed in RHB buffer and resuspended at a density of 106 cells/ml. In a typical assay, 50 µl of PSCA antibody, 50 µl of diluted rabbit complement serum (Cedarlane, Ontario, Can), and 50 µl of a cell suspension were added together into a flat-bottom tissue culture 96-well plate. The mixture was incubated for 2 hr. at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator to facilitate complement-mediated cell lysis. 50 µl of Alamar Blue (Biosource Intl. Camarillo, CA) was added to each well and incubation continued for an additional 4-5 hr at 37°C. The fluorescence in each well was read using a 96-well fluorometer with excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm. The results show that PSCA antibodies having an IgG\n1\n (HA1-4.121) or an IgG\n2\n isotype (HA1-5.99.1) but not an IgG\n4\n isotype (HA1-6.46) were able to mediate complement dependent lysis of target cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 15\n. Generation of F(ab')2 fragments of MAb Ha1-4.121 by pepsin digestion. 20 mgs of MAb Ha1-4.121 in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 4.5 was incubated with and without immobilized pepsin (Pierce. Rockford IL) for the indicated times. Intact MAb and digested Fc fragments were removed by protein A chromatography. Shown is a SDS-PAGE Coomasie stained gel of intact undigested unreduced MAb, unreduced aliquots of digested material taken at the indicated times, and a reduced sample of the final digested F(ab')2 product,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 16\n. Binding of recombinant anti-PSCA human mAb to PSCA by flow cytometry. (16A) 293T cells were transfected with expression constructs encoding the heavy and light chains of anti-PSCA human mAb. Supernatant was collected after 48 hours and assayed for binding to PSCA. (16B) Anti-PSCA human mAb was purified from hybridoma supernatant and used for PSCA binding assays. PSCA binding was tested as follows. PC3 parental or PC3-PSCA cells were incubated with the anti-PSCA human mAbs described above for 30 minutes on ice. The cells were washed and incubated with PE-conjugated anti-human Ig for 30 minutes on ice. The cells were washed and then assayed by flow cytometry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 17\n. Detection of PSCA protein by immunohistochemistry. Expression of PSCA protein in tumor specimens from cancer patients was detected using the antibody HA1-4.117. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues were cut into 4 micron sections and mounted on glass slides. The sections were dewaxed, rehydrated and treated with antigen retrieval solution (Antigen Retrieval Citra Solution; BioGenex, 4600 Norris Canyon Road, San Ramon, CA, 94583) at high temperature. Sections were then incubated in fluorescein conjugated human monoclonal anti-PSCA antibody, Ha1-4.117, for 16 hours at 4°C. The slides were washed three times in buffer and further incubated with Rabbit anti-Fluorescein for 1 hour and, after washing in buffer, immersed in DAKO En Vision+™ peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin secondary antibody (DAKO Corporation, Carpenteria, CA) for 30 minutes. The sections were then washed in buffer, developed using the DAB kit (SIGMA Chemicals), counterstained using hematoxylin, and analyzed by bright field microscopy. The results show expression of PSCA in the tumor cells of prostate adenocarcinoma (Panel A, Panel B), bladder transitional carcinoma (Panel C) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Panel D). These results indicate that PSCA is expressed in human cancers and that antibodies directed to this antigen are useful as diagnostic reagents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 18\n. PSCA MAb Ha1-4.120 Inhibits the Growth of Subcutaneous Prostate Cancer Xenografts. LAPC-9AI tumor cells (2.0 x 106 cells) were injected subcutaneously into male SCID mice.

PSCA Mab HA1-4.121 Inhibits the Growth of Established Androgen-dependent Human Prostate Cancer Xenografts. LAPC-9AD tumor cells (2.5 x 106 cells) were injected subcutaneously into male SCID mice. When the tumor volume reached 40 mm3, the mice were randomized into groups (n=10 in each group) and treatment was initiated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with increasing concentrations of HA1-4.121 or isotype MAb control as indicated. Animals were treated twice weekly for a total of 7 doses until \nstudy day\n 21. Tumor growth was monitored using caliper measurements every 3 to 4 days as indicated. The results from this study demonstrated that HA1-4.121 inhibited the growth of established subcutaneous human androgen-dependent prostate xenografts in SCID mice. The results were statistically significant for the 300 ug dose group on \n \ndays\n \n 14, 17 and 21 (p< 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test, two-sided with α=0.05) and for the 700 ug dose group on \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 10, 14, 17 and 21 (p< 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test, two-sided with α=0.05).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 21\n. Patient-derived, androgen-dependent, LAPC-9AD tumor cells (2.0 x 106 cells) were injected into the dorsal lobes of the prostates of male SCID mice. The tumors were allowed to grow for approximately 10 days at which time the mice were randomized into groups. Treatment with human 500 ug of HA1-4.117, HA1-4.121 or Isotype control MAb was initiated 10 days after tumor implantation. Antibodies were delivered intraperitoneally two times a week for a total of 7 doses. Four days after the last dose, animals were sacrificed and primary tumors excised and weighed. The results show that Human anti-PSCA monoclonal antibodies Ha1-4.121 (p< 0.01) and Ha1-4.117 (p< 0.05) significantly inhibited the growth of LAPC-9AD prostate cancer xenografts orthotopically implanted in SCID mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 22\n. PSCA MAb HA1-4.121 Prolongs the Survival of SCID Mice with Established Orthotopic Human Androgen-Dependent Prostate Tumors. Patient-derived, androgen-dependent, LAPC-9AD tumor cells (2.0 x 106 cells) were injected into the dorsal lobes of the prostates of male SCID mice. The tumors were allowed to grow for approximately 9 days at which time the mice were randomized into groups. The animals randomized into the survival groups include 11 mice in the isotype MAb control and 12 mice in the HA1-4.121 treated group. Animals were treated i.p. with 1000 ug Ha1-4.121 or 1000 ug of isotype MAb control twice weekly for a total of 9 doses. The results demonstrated that HA1-4.121 significantly (log-rank test: p<0.01) prolonged the survival of SCID mice with human androgen-dependent prostate tumors. Two mice in the HA1-4.121 treated group remained free of \npalpable tumors\n 110 days after the last treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 23\n. Enhanced Inhibition of Prostate Tumor Growth with HA1-4.21 and Taxotere Combination Therapy. LAPC-9AI tumor cells (2 x 106 cells per animal) were injected subcutaneously into male SCID mice. When the tumor volume reached 65 mm3, animals were randomized and assigned to four different groups (n=10 in each group) as indicated. Beginning on \nday\n 0, Ha1-4.121 or isotype MAb control were administered i.p. two times a week at a dose of 500 ug for a total of 6 doses. The last dose was given on \nday\n 17. Taxotere was given intravenously at a dose of 5 mg/kg on \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 0, 3 and 7. Tumor growth was monitored every 3-4 days using caliper measurements. The results from this study demonstrate that HA1-4.121 as a single agent inhibited the growth of androgen-independent prostate xenografts in SCID mice by 45% when compared to control antibody treatment alone on day 28 (ANOVA/Tukey test: p<0.05). Administration of the isotype MAb control plus taxotere inhibited tumor growth by 28% when compared to control antibody treatment alone, which was not statistically significant. Administration of HA1-4.121 in combination with Taxotere, enhanced the effect and resulted in a 69% inhibition of tumor growth when compared to control antibody alone (ANOVA/Tukey test: p<0.01). A statistically significant difference was also demonstrated when the HA1-4.121 plus Taxotere combination group was compared to either the HA1-4.121 or isotype MAb control plus Taxotere groups (ANOVA/Tukey test: p<0.05).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 24\n. Human PSCA MAbs Inhibit the Growth of Pancreatic Cancer Xenografts in SCID mice/ Human HPAC. Pancreatic cancer cells (2 x 106/ mouse) were injected subcutaneously into immunodeficient ICR SCID mice (Taconic Farm, Germantown, NY). The mice were randomized into groups (n= 10 animals/group) and treatment with the indicated humanPSCA monoclonal antibody initiated the same day. Antibodies (500 mg/mouse) were delivered intraperitoneally two times a week for a total of 8 doses. The results demonstrated that human anti-PSCA monoclonal antibodies Ha1-4.121, Ha1-4.117 and Ha1-1.16 significantly inhibited the growth of human pancreatic cancer xenografts subcutaneously implanted in SCID mice. Statistical analyses were performed using a t test (two-sided, α=0.05).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 25\n. PSCA MAb HA1-4.121 Inhibits the Growth of Pancreatic Tumors Implanted Orthotopically in SCID Mice. HPAC cells (3.0 x 106 cells) were implanted orthotopically into the pancreata of SCID mice. Mice were randomly assigned to three groups (n=9 in each group) as indicated. Treatment with HA1-4.121 (250 ug or 1000 ug) or isotype MAb control (1000 ug) was initiated on the day of implantation. Antibodies were administered i.p. twice weekly for a total of 10 doses. Thirteen days after the last dose, animals were sacrificed and primary tumors excised and weighed. The results from this study demonstrated that HA1-4.121 significantly inhibited the orthotopic growth of human pancreatic cancer xenografts in SCID mice at both dose levels examined. Treatment with 250 ug and 1000 ug AGS-PSCA inhibited tumor growth by 66% and 70%, respectively (Kruskal-Wallis/Tukey test: p<0.01 and p<0.01, respectively).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 26\n. PSCA MAb HA1-4.121 inhibits matastases. At autopsy, visible metastases to lymph nodes and distant organs were observed in the control antibody treated group. No visible metastases were observed in both HA1-4.121 treated groups. Lymph nodes, lungs and livers were removed from all animals and examined histologically for the presence of metastatic tumor. Sections from the lungs and lymph nodes removed from each animal were stained for human cytokeratin and the number of metastases determined microscopically. The results from the histologic analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in lymph node (LN) metastases in animal treated with HA1-4.121 (p= 0.0152 as detected by Fishers exact test). The incidence of metastasis and invasion was also decreased significantly in animals treated with both concentrations of HA1-4.121 (p= 0.0152 as detected by Fishers exact test), The number of lung metastases decreased significantly in mice treated with the 1.0 mg dose of HA1-4.121 only (p= 0.0498 as detected by Fishers exact test).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 27\n.

Definitions:\n\n\n \n \n \nUnless otherwise defined, all terms of art, notations and other scientific terms or terminology used herein are intended to have the meanings commonly understood by those of skill in the art to which this invention pertains. In some cases, terms with commonly understood meanings are defined herein for clarity and/or for ready reference, and the inclusion of such definitions herein should not necessarily be construed to represent a substantial difference over what is generally understood in the art. Many of the techniques and procedures described or referenced herein are well understood and commonly employed using conventional methodology by those skilled in the art, such as, for example, the widely utilized molecular cloning methodologies described in \nSambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual 2nd. edition (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y\n. As appropriate, procedures involving the use of commercially available kits and reagents are generally carried out in accordance with manufacturer defined protocols and/or parameters unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"advanced prostate cancer\", \"locally advanced prostate cancer\", \"advanced disease\" and \"locally advanced disease\" mean prostate cancers that have extended through the prostate capsule, and are meant to include stage C disease under the American Urological Association (AUA) system, stage C1 - C2 disease under the Whitmore-Jewett system, and stage T3 - T4 and N+ disease under the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) system. In general, surgery is not recommended for patients with locally advanced disease, and these patients have substantially less favorable outcomes compared to patients having clinically localized (organ-confined) prostate cancer. Locally advanced disease is clinically identified by palpable evidence of induration beyond the lateral border of the prostate, or asymmetry or induration above the prostate base. Locally advanced prostate cancer is presently diagnosed pathologically following radical prostatectomy if the tumor invades or penetrates the prostatic capsule, extends into the surgical margin, or invades the seminal vesicles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Altering the native glycosylation pattern\" is intended for purposes herein to mean deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in native sequence PSCA (either by removing the underlying glycosylation site or by deleting the glycosylation by chemical and/or enzymatic means), and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the native sequence PSCA. In addition, the phrase includes qualitative changes in the glycosylation of the native proteins, involving a change in the nature and proportions of the various carbohydrate moieties present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"analog\" refers to a molecule which is structurally similar or shares similar or corresponding attributes with another molecule (e.g. a PSCA-related protein). For example, an analog of a PSCA protein can be specifically bound by an antibody or T cell that specifically binds to PSCA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"antibody\" is used in the broadest sense unless clearly indicated otherwise. Therefore, an \"antibody\" can be naturally occurring or man-made such as monoclonal antibodies produced by conventional hybridoma technology. Anti-PSCA antibodies comprise monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies as well as fragments containing the antigen-binding domain and/or one or more complementarity determining regions of these antibodies. As used herein, the term \"antibody\" refers to any form of antibody or fragment thereof that specifically binds PSCA and/or exhibits the desired biological activity and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (\ne.g\n., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they specifically bind PSCA and/or exhibit the desired biological activity. Any specific antibody can be used in the methods and compositions provided herein. Thus, in one embodiment the term \"antibody\" encompasses a molecule comprising at least one variable region from a light chain immunoglobulin molecule and at least one variable region from a heavy chain molecule that in combination form a specific binding site for the target antigen. In one embodiment, the antibody is an IgG antibody. For example, the antibody is a IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 antibody. The antibodies useful in the present methods and compositions can be generated in cell culture, in phage, or in various animals, including but not limited to cows, rabbits, goats, mice, rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, sheep, dogs, cats, monkeys, chimpanzees, apes. Therefore, in one embodiment, an antibody of the present invention is a mammalian antibody. Phage techniques can be used to isolate an initial antibody or to generate variants with altered specificity or avidity characteristics. Such techniques are routine and well known in the art. In one embodiment, the antibody is produced by recombinant means known in the art. For example, a recombinant antibody can be produced by transfecting a host cell with a vector comprising a DNA sequence encoding the antibody. One or more vectors can be used to transfect the DNA sequence expressing at least one VL and one VH region in the host cell. Exemplary descriptions of recombinant means of antibody generation and production include \nDelves, ANTIBODY PRODUCTION: ESSENTIAL TECHNIQUES (Wiley, 1997\n); \nShephard, et al., MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (Oxford University Press, 2000\n); \nGoding, MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES: PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE (Academic Press, 1993\n); \nCURRENT PROTOCOLS IN IMMUNOLOGY (John Wiley & Sons\n, most recent edition). An antibody of the present invention can be modified by recombinant means to increase greater efficacy of the antibody in mediating the desired function. Thus, it is within the scope of the invention that antibodies can be modified by substitutions using recombinant means. Typically, the substitutions will be conservative substitutions. For example, at least one amino acid in the constant region of the antibody can be replaced with a different residue. See, \ne.g\n., \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,624,821\n \n, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,194,551\n \n, \n \nApplication No. WO 9958572\n \n; and \nAngal, et al., Mol. Immunol. 30 : 105-08 (1993\n). The modification in amino acids includes deletions, additions, substitutions of amino acids. In some cases, such changes are made to reduce undesired activities, e.g., complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Frequently, the antibodies are labeled by joining, either covalently or non-covalently, a substance which provides for a detectable signal. A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known and are reported extensively in both the scientific and patent literature. These antibodies can be screened for binding to normal or defective PSCA. See \ne.g\n., \nANTIBODY ENGINEERING: A PRACTICAL APPROACH (Oxford University Press, 1996\n). Suitable antibodies with the desired biologic activities can be identified the following \nin vitro\n assays including but not limited to: proliferation, migration, adhesion, soft agar growth, angiogenesis, cell-cell communication, apoptosis, transport, signal transduction, and the following \nin vivo\n assays such as the inhibition of tumor growth. The antibodies provided herein can also be useful in diagnostic applications. As capture or non-neutralizing antibodies, they can be screened for the ability to bind to the specific antigen without inhibiting the receptor-binding or biological activity of the antigen. As neutralizing antibodies, the antibodies can be useful in competitive binding assays. They can also be used to quantify the PSCA or its receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"antibody fragment\" is defined as at least a portion of the variable region of the immunoglobulin molecule that binds to its target, \ni.e.,\n the antigen-binding region. In one embodiment it specifically covers single anti-PSCA antibodies and clones thereof (including agonist, antagonist and neutralizing antibodies) and anti-PSCA antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity. The antibody of the present methods and compositions can be monoclonal or polyclonal. An antibody can be in the form of an antigen binding antibody fragment including a Fab fragment, F(ab')\n2\n fragment, a single chain variable region, and the like. Fragments of intact molecules can be generated using methods well known in the art and include enzymatic digestion and recombinant means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, any form of the \"antigen\" can be used to generate an antibody that is specific for PSCA. Thus, the eliciting antigen may be a single epitope, multiple epitopes, or the entire protein alone or in combination with one or more immunogenicity enhancing agents known in the art. The eliciting antigen may be an isolated full-length protein, a cell surface protein (\ne.g\n., immunizing with cells transfected with at least a portion of the antigen), or a soluble protein (\ne.g\n., immunizing with only the extracellular domain portion of the protein). The antigen may be produced in a genetically modified cell. The DNA encoding the antigen may genomic or non-genomic (\ne.g\n., cDNA) and encodes at least a portion of the extracellular domain. As used herein, the term \"portion\" refers to the minimal number of amino acids or nucleic acids, as appropriate, to constitute an immunogenic epitope of the antigen of interest. Any genetic vectors suitable for transformation of the cells of interest may be employed, including but not limited to adenoviral vectors, plasmids, and non-viral vectors, such as cationic lipids. In one embodiment, the antibody of the methods and compositions herein specifically bind at least a portion of the extracellular domain of the PSCA of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof provided herein may be conjugated to a \"bioactive agent.\" As used herein, the term \"bioactive agent\" refers to any synthetic or naturally occurring compound that binds the antigen and/or enhances or mediates a desired biological effect to enhance cell-killing toxins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the binding fragments useful in the present invention are biologically active fragments. As used herein, the term \"biologically active\" refers to an antibody or antibody fragment that is capable of binding the desired the antigenic epitope and directly or indirectly exerting a biologic effect. Direct effects include, but are not limited to the modulation, stimulation, and/ or inhibition of a growth signal, the modulation, stimulation, and/ or inhibition of an anti-apoptotic signal, the modulation, stimulation, and/ or inhibition of an apoptotic or necrotic signal, modulation, stimulation, and/ or inhibition the ADCC cascade, and modulation, stimulation, and/ or inhibition the CDC cascade.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Bispecific\" antibodies are also useful in the present methods and compositions. As used herein, the term \"bispecific antibody\" refers to an antibody, typically a monoclonal antibody, having binding specificities for at least two different antigenic epitopes. In one embodiment, the epitopes are from the same antigen. In another embodiment, the epitopes are from two different antigens. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. For example, bispecific antibodies can be produced recombinantly using the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain/light chain pairs. See, e.g., \nMilstein et al., Nature 305:537-39 (1983\n). Alternatively, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. See, \ne.g\n., \nBrennan, et al., Science 229:81 (1985\n). Bispecific antibodies include bispecific antibody fragments. See, \ne.g\n., \nHollinger, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90:6444-48 (1993\n), \nGruber, et al, J. Immunol. 152:5368 (1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \"chimeric\" antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they specifically bind the target antigen and/or exhibit the desired biological activity (\n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567\n \n; and \nMorrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81: 6851-6855 (1984\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"Chemotherapeutic Agent\" refers to all chemical compounds that are effective in inhibiting tumor growth. Non-limiting examples of chemotherapeutic agents include alkylating agents; for example, nitrogen mustards, ethyleneimine compounds and alkyl sulphonates; antimetabolites; for example, folic acid, purine or pyrimidine antagonists; mitotic inhibitors; for example, vinca alkaloids and derivatives of podophyllotoxin, cytotoxic antibiotics, compounds that damage or interfere with DNA expression, and growth factor receptor antagonists. In addition, chemotherapeutic agents include cytotoxic agents (as defined herein), antibodies, biological molecules and small molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"codon optimized sequences\" refers to nucleotide sequences that have been optimized for a particular host species by replacing any codons having a usage frequency of less than about 20%. Nucleotide sequences that have been optimized for expression in a given host species by elimination of spurious polyadenylation sequences, elimination of exon/intron splicing signals, elimination of transposon-like repeats and/or optimization of GC content in addition to codon optimization are referred to herein as an \"expression enhanced sequences.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"combinatorial library\" is a collection of diverse chemical compounds generated by either chemical synthesis or biological synthesis by combining a number of chemical \"building blocks\" such as reagents. For example, a linear combinatorial chemical library, such as a polypeptide (\ne.g\n., mutein) library, is formed by combining a set of chemical building blocks called amino acids in every possible way for a given compound length (\ni.e\n., the number of amino acids in a polypeptide compound). Numerous chemical compounds are synthesized through such combinatorial mixing of chemical building blocks (\nGallop et al., J. Med. Chem. 37(9); 1233-1251 (1994\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation and screening of combinatorial libraries is well known to those of skill in the art. Such combinatorial chemical libraries include, but are not limited to, peptide libraries (see, \ne.g\n., \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,010,175\n \n, \nFurka, Pept. Prot. Res. 37:487-493 (1991\n), \nHoughton et al., Nature, 354:84-88 (1991\n)), peptoids (\n \nPCT Publication No WO 91/19735\n \n), encoded peptides (\n \nPCT Publication WO 93/20242\n \n), random bio- oligomers (\n \nPCT Publication WO 92/00091\n \n), benzodiazepines (\n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,288,514\n \n), diversomers such as hydantoins, benzodiazepines and dipeptides (\nHobbs et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6909-6913 (1993\n)), vinylogous polypeptides (\nHagihara et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 114:6568 (1992\n)), nonpeptidal peptidomimetics with a Beta-D-Glucose scaffolding (\nHirschmann et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 114:9217-9218 (1992\n)), analogous organic syntheses of small compound libraries (\nChen et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 11b:2661 (1994\n)), oligocarbarnates (\nCho, et al., Science 261:1303 (1993\n)), and/or peptidyl phosphonates (\nCampbell et al., J. Org. Chem. 59:658 (1994\n)). See, generally, \nGordon et al., J. Med. Chem. 37:1385 (1994\n), nucleic acid libraries (see, \ne.g\n., Stratagene, Corp.), peptide nucleic acid libraries (see, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. Patent 5,539,083\n \n), antibody libraries (see, \ne.g.\n, \nVaughn et al., Nature Biotechnology 14(3): 309-314 (1996\n), and \n \nPCT/US96/10287\n \n), carbohydrate libraries (see, \ne.g.\n, \nLiang et al., Science 274:1520-1522 (1996\n), and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,593,853\n \n), and small organic molecule libraries (see, e.g., benzodiazepines, \nBaum, C&EN, \n); isoprenoids, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,569,588\n \n; thiazolidinones and metathiazanones, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,549,974\n \n; pyrrolidines, \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,525,735\n \n and \n \n5,519,134\n \n; morpholino compounds, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,506,337\n \n; benzodiazepines, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,288,514\n \n; and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDevices for the preparation of combinatorial libraries are commercially available (see, e.g., 357 NIPS, 390 NIPS, Advanced Chem Tech, Louisville KY; Symphony, Rainin, Woburn, MA; 433A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA; 9050, Plus, Millipore, Bedford, NIA). A number of well-known robotic systems have also been developed for solution phase chemistries. These systems include automated workstations such as the automated synthesis apparatus developed by Takeda Chemical Industries, LTD. (Osaka, Japan) and many robotic systems utilizing robotic arms (Zymate H, Zymark Corporation, Hopkinton, Mass.; Orca, Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, Calif.), which mimic the manual synthetic operations performed by a chemist. Any of the above devices are suitable for use with the present invention. The nature and implementation of modifications to these devices (if any) so that they can operate as discussed herein will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art. In addition, numerous combinatorial libraries are themselves commercially available (see, \ne.g.\n, ComGenex, Princeton, NJ; Asinex, Moscow, RU; Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO; ChemStar, Ltd, Moscow, RU; 3D Pharmaceuticals, Exton, PA; Martek Biosciences, Columbia, MD; etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"conservative substitution\" refers to substitutions of amino acids are known to those of skill in this art and may be made generally without altering the biological activity of the resulting molecule. Those of skill in this art recognize that, in general, single amino acid substitutions in non-essential regions of a polypeptide do not substantially alter biological activity (see, \ne.g.\n, \nWatson, et al., MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE GENE, The Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co., p. 224 (4th Edition 1987\n)). Such exemplary substitutions are preferably made in accordance with those set forth in Table(s) III(a-b). For example, such changes include substituting any of isoleucine (I), valine (V), and leucine (L) for any other of these hydrophobic amino acids; aspartic acid (D) for glutamic acid (E) and vice versa; glutamine (Q) for asparagine (N) and vice versa; and serine (S) for threonine (T) and vice versa. Other substitutions can also be considered conservative, depending on the environment of the particular amino acid and its role in the three-dimensional structure of the protein. For example, glycine (G) and alanine (A) can frequently be interchangeable, as can alanine (A) and valine (V). Methionine (M), which is relatively hydrophobic, can frequently be interchanged with leucine and isoleucine, and sometimes with valine. Lysine (K) and arginine (R) are frequently interchangeable in locations in which the significant feature of the amino acid residue is its charge and the differing pK's of these two amino acid residues are not significant. Still other changes can be considered \"conservative\" in particular environments (see, \ne.g.\n Table III(a) herein; \npages 13-15 \"\nBiochemistry\n\" 2nd ED. Lubert Stryer ed (Stanford University\n); \nHenikoff et al., PNAS 1992 Vol 89 10915-10919\n; \nLei et al., J Biol Chem 1995 May 19; 270(20):11882-6\n). Other substitutions are also permissible and may be determined empirically or in accord with known conservative substitutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"cytotoxic agent\" refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the expression activity of cells, function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes, chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including fragments and/or variants thereof. Examples of cytotoxic agents include, but are not limited to auristatins, auristatin e, auromycins, maytansinoids, yttrium, bismuth, ricin, ricin A-chain, combrestatin, duocarmycins, dolostatins, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, taxol, cisplatin, cc1065, ethidium bromide, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicine, dihydroxy anthracin dione, actinomycin, diphtheria toxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) A, PE40, abrin, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, gelonin, mitogellin, retstrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, curicin, crotin, calicheamicin, Sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, and glucocorticoid and other chemotherapeutic agents, as well as radioisotopes such as At\n211\n, I\n131\n, I\n125\n, Y\n90\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188\n, Sm\n153\n, Bi\n212\n or \n213\n, P\n32\n and radioactive isotopes of Lu including Lu\n177\n. Antibodies may also be conjugated to an anti-cancer pro-drug activating enzyme capable of converting the pro-drug to its active form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"diabodies\" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) connected to a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) in the same polypeptide chain (V\nH\n-V\nL\n). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, e.g., \n \nEP 404,097\n \n; \n \nWO 93/11161\n \n; and\n Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-48 (1993\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \"gene product\" is used herein to indicate a peptide/protein or mRNA. For example, a \"gene product of the invention\" is sometimes referred to herein as a \"cancer amino acid sequence\", \"cancer protein\", \"protein of a cancer listed in Table I\", a \"cancer mRNA\", \"mRNA of a cancer listed in Table I\", etc. In one embodiment, the cancer protein is encoded by a nucleic acid of \nFigure 1\n. The cancer protein can be a fragment, or alternatively, be the full-length protein encoded by nucleic acids of \nFigure 1\n. In one embodiment, a cancer amino acid sequence is used to determine sequence identity or similarity. In another embodiment, the sequences are naturally occurring allelic variants of a protein encoded by a nucleic acid of \nFigure 1\n. In another embodiment, the sequences are sequence variants as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Heteroconjugate\" antibodies are useful in the present methods and compositions, As used herein, the term \"heteroconjugate antibody\" refers to two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies can be prepared using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including using crosslinking agents. See, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,676,980\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"High throughput screening\" assays for the presence, absence, quantification, or other properties of particular nucleic acids or protein products are well known to those of skill in the art. Similarly, binding assays and reporter gene assays are similarly well known. Thus, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,559,410\n \n discloses high throughput screening methods for proteins; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,585,639\n \n discloses high throughput screening methods for nucleic acid binding (\ni.e.\n, in arrays); while \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,576,220\n \n and \n \n5,541,061\n \n disclose high throughput methods of screening for ligand/antibody binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, high throughput screening systems are commercially available (see, \ne.g.\n, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ; Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, MA; Air Technical Industries, Mentor, OH; Beckman Instruments, Inc. Fullerton, CA; Precision Systems, Inc., Natick, MA; etc.). These systems typically automate entire procedures, including all sample and reagent pipetting, liquid dispensing, timed incubations, and final readings of the microplate in detector(s) appropriate for the assay. These configurable systems provide high throughput and rapid start up as well as a high degree of flexibility and customization. The manufacturers of such systems provide detailed protocols for various high throughput systems. Thus, \ne.g.\n, Zymark Corp. provides technical bulletins describing screening systems for detecting the modulation of gene transcription, ligand binding, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"homolog\" refers to a molecule which exhibits homology to another molecule, by for example, having sequences of chemical residues that are the same or similar at corresponding positions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the antibody provided herein is a \"human antibody.\" As used herein, the term \"human antibody\" refers to an antibody in which essentially the entire sequences of the light chain and heavy chain sequences, including the complementary determining regions (CDRs), are from human genes. In one embodiment, human monoclonal antibodies are prepared by the trioma technique, the human B-cell technique (see, \ne.g.\n,\n Kozbor, et al., Immunol. Today 4: 72 (1983\n), EBV transformation technique (see, \ne.g.\n, \nCole et al. MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AND CANCER THERAPY 77-96 (1985\n)), or using phage display (see, \ne.g.\n, \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222:581 (1991\n)). In a specific embodiment, the human antibody is generated in a transgenic mouse. Techniques for making such partially to fully human antibodies are known in the art and any such techniques can be used. According to one particularly preferred embodiment, fully human antibody sequences are made in a transgenic mouse engineered to express human heavy and light chain antibody genes. An exemplary description of preparing transgenic mice that produce human antibodies found in Application No. \n \nWO 02/43478\n \n and United States Patent \n \n6,657,103\n \n (Abgenix) and its progeny. B cells from transgenic mice that produce the desired antibody can then be fused to make hybridoma cell lines for continuous production of the antibody. See, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,569,825\n \n; \n \n5,625,126\n \n; \n \n5,633,425\n \n; \n \n5,661,016\n \n; and \n \n5,545,806\n \n; and \nJakobovits, Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 31:33-42 (1998\n); \nGreen, et al., J. Exp. Med. 188:483-95 (1998\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Human Leukocyte Antigen\" or \"HLA\" is a human class I or class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) protein (see, \ne.g.\n, \nStites, et al., IMMUNOLOGY, 8TH ED., Lange Publishing, Los Altos, CA (1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"humanized antibody\" refers to forms of antibodies that contain sequences from non-human (\ne.g.\n, murine) antibodies as well as human antibodies. Such antibodies are chimeric antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. See \ne.g.\n, \n \nCabilly U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n; \nQueen et al. (1989) Proc. Nat'1 Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029-10033\n; and \nANTIBODY ENGINEERING: A PRACTICAL APPROACH (Oxford University Press 1996\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"hybridize\", \"hybridizing\", \"hybridizes\" and the like, used in the context of polynucleotides, are meant to refer to conventional hybridization conditions, preferably such as hybridization in 50% formamide/6XSSC/0.1% SDS/100 µg/ml ssDNA, in which temperatures for hybridization are above 37 degrees C and temperatures for washing in 0.1XSSC/0.1% SDS are above 55 degrees C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrases \"isolated\" or \"biologically pure\" refer to material which is substantially or essentially free from components which normally accompany the material as it is found in its native state. Thus, isolated peptides in accordance with the invention preferably do not contain materials normally associated with the peptides in their in situ environment. For example, a polynucleotide is said to be \"isolated\" when it is substantially separated from contaminant polynucleotides that correspond or are complementary to genes other than the PSCA genes or that encode polypeptides other than PSCA gene product or fragments thereof. A skilled artisan can readily employ nucleic acid isolation procedures to obtain an isolated PSCA polynucleotide. A protein is said to be \"isolated,\" for example, when physical, mechanical or chemical methods are employed to remove the PSCA proteins from cellular constituents that are normally associated with the protein. A skilled artisan can readily employ standard purification methods to obtain an isolated PSCA protein. Alternatively, an isolated protein can be prepared by chemical means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable \"labels\" include radionuclides, enzymes, substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, fluorescent moieties, chemiluminescent moieties, magnetic particles, and the like. Patents teaching the use of such labels include \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 3,817,837\n \n; \n \n3,850,752\n \n; \n \n3,939,350\n \n; \n \n3,996,345\n \n; \n \n4,277,437\n \n; \n \n4,275,149\n \n; and \n \n4,366,241\n \n. In addition, the antibodies provided herein can be useful as the antigen-binding component of fluorobodies. See \ne.g.\n, \nZeytun et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 21:1473-79 (2003\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"mammal\" refers to any organism classified as a mammal, including mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, cats, cows, horses and humans. In one embodiment of the invention, the mammal is a mouse. In another embodiment of the invention, the mammal is a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"metastatic prostate cancer\" and \"metastatic disease\" mean prostate cancers that have spread to regional lymph nodes or to distant sites, and are meant to include stage D disease under the AUA system and stage TxNxM+ under the TNM system. As is the case with locally advanced prostate cancer, surgery is generally not indicated for patients with metastatic disease, and hormonal (androgen ablation) therapy is a preferred treatment modality. Patients with metastatic prostate cancer eventually develop an androgen-refractory state within 12 to 18 months of treatment initiation. Approximately half of these androgen-refractory patients die within 6 months after developing that status. The most common site for prostate cancer metastasis is bone. Prostate cancer bone metastases are often osteoblastic rather than osteolytic (\ni.e.\n, resulting in net bone formation). Bone metastases are found most frequently in the spine, followed by the femur, pelvis, rib cage, skull and humerus. Other common sites for metastasis include lymph nodes, lung, liver and brain. Metastatic prostate cancer is typically diagnosed by open or laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy, whole body radionuclide scans, skeletal radiography, and/or bone lesion biopsy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"modulator\" or \"test compound\" or \"drug candidate\" or grammatical equivalents as used herein describe any molecule, \ne.g.\n, protein, oligopeptide, small organic molecule, polysaccharide, polynucleotide, etc., to be tested for the capacity to directly or indirectly alter the cancer phenotype or the expression of a cancer sequence, \ne.g.\n, a nucleic acid or protein sequences, or effects of cancer sequences (\ne.g.\n, signaling, gene expression, protein interaction, etc.) In one aspect, a modulator will neutralize the effect of a cancer protein of the invention. By \"neutralize\" is meant that an activity of a protein is inhibited or blocked, along with the consequent effect on the cell. In another aspect, a modulator will neutralize the effect of a gene, and its corresponding protein, of the invention by normalizing levels of said protein. In preferred embodiments, modulators alter expression profiles, or expression profile nucleic acids or proteins provided herein, or downstream effector pathways. In one embodiment, the modulator suppresses a cancer phenotype, \ne.g.\n to a normal tissue fingerprint. In another embodiment, a modulator induced a cancer phenotype. Generally, a plurality of assay mixtures is run in parallel with different agent concentrations to obtain a differential response to the various concentrations. Typically, one of these concentrations serves as a negative control, \ni.e.\n, at zero concentration or below the level of detection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModulators, drug candidates or test compounds encompass numerous chemical classes, though typically they are organic molecules, preferably small organic compounds having a molecular weight of more than 100 and less than about 2,500 Daltons. Preferred small molecules are less than 2000, or less than 1500 or less than 1000 or less than 500 D. Candidate agents comprise functional groups necessary for structural interaction with proteins, particularly hydrogen bonding, and typically include at least an amine, carbonyl, hydroxyl or carboxyl group, preferably at least two of the functional chemical groups. The candidate agents often comprise cyclical carbon or heterocyclic structures and/or aromatic or polyaromatic structures substituted with one or more of the above functional groups. Modulators also comprise biomolecules such as peptides, saccharides, fatty acids, steroids, purines, pyrimidines, derivatives, structural analogs or combinations thereof. Particularly preferred are peptides. One class of modulators are peptides, for example of from about five to about 35 amino acids, with from about five to about 20 amino acids being preferred, and from about 7 to about 15 being particularly preferred. Preferably, the cancer modulatory protein is soluble, includes a non-transmembrane region, and/or, has an N-terminal Cys to aid in solubility. In one embodiment, the C-terminus of the fragment is kept as a free acid and the N-terminus is a free amine to aid in coupling, \ni.e.\n, to cysteine. In one embodiment, a cancer protein of the invention is conjugated to an immunogenic agent as discussed herein. In one embodiment, the cancer protein is conjugated to BSA. The peptides of the invention, \ne.g.\n, of preferred lengths, can be linked to each other or to other amino acids to create a longer peptide/protein. The modulatory peptides can be digests of naturally occurring proteins as is outlined above, random peptides, or \"biased\" random peptides. In a preferred embodiment, peptide/protein-based modulators are antibodies, and fragments thereof, as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModulators of cancer can also be nucleic acids. Nucleic acid modulating agents can be naturally occurring nucleic acids, random nucleic acids, or \"biased\" random nucleic acids. For example, digests of prokaryotic or eukaryotic genomes can be used in an approach analogous to that outlined above for proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"monoclonal antibody\", as used herein, refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, \ni.e.\n, the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic epitope. In contrast, conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations typically include a multitude of antibodies directed against (or specific for) different epitopes. In one embodiment, the polyclonal antibody contains a plurality of monoclonal antibodies with different epitope specificities, affinities, or avidities within a single antigen that contains multiple antigenic epitopes. The modifier \"monoclonal\" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by \nKohler et al., Nature 256; 495 (1975\n), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567\n \n). The \"monoclonal antibodies\" may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in \nClackson et al., Nature 352: 624-628 (1991\n) and \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597 (1991\n), for example. These monoclonal antibodies will usually bind with at least a Kd of about 1 µM, more usually at least about 300 nM, typically at least about 30 nM, preferably at least about 10 nM, more preferably at least about 3 nM or better, usually determined by ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"motif\", as in biological motif of a PSCA-related protein, refers to any pattern of amino acids forming part of the primary sequence of a protein, that is associated with a particular function (\ne.g.\n protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, etc) or modification (\ne.g.\n that is phosphorylated, glycosylated or amidated), or localization (\ne.g.\n secretory sequence, nuclear localization sequence, etc.) or a sequence that is correlated with being immunogenic, either humorally or cellularly. A motif can be either contiguous or capable of being aligned to certain positions that are generally correlated with a certain function or property. In the context of HLA motifs, \"motif\" refers to the pattern of residues in a peptide of defined length, usually a peptide of from about 8 to about 13 amino acids for a class I HLA motif and from about 6 to about 25 amino acids for a class II HLA motif, which is recognized, by a particular HLA molecule. Peptide motifs for HLA binding are typically different for each protein encoded by each human HLA allele and differ in the pattern of the primary and secondary anchor residues. Frequently occurring motifs are set forth in Table V.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"pharmaceutical excipient\" comprises a material such as an adjuvant, a carrier, pH-adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, wetting agents, preservative, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Pharmaceutically acceptable\" refers to a non-toxic, inert, and/or composition that is physiologically compatible with humans or other mammals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"polynucleotide\" means a polymeric form of nucleotides of at least 10 bases or base pairs in length, either ribonucleotides or deoxynucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide, and is meant to include single and double stranded forms of DNA and/or RNA. In the art, this term if often used interchangeably with \"oligonucleotide\". A polynucleotide can comprise a nucleotide sequence disclosed herein wherein thymidine (T), as shown for example in \nFigure 1\n, can also be uracil (U); this definition pertains to the differences between the chemical structures of DNA and RNA, in particular the observation that one of the four major bases in RNA is uracil (U) instead of thymidine (T).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"polypeptide\" means a polymer of at least about 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 amino acids. Throughout the specification, standard three letter or single letter designations for amino acids are used. In the art, this term is often used interchangeably with \"peptide\" or \"protein\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn HLA \"primary anchor residue\" is an amino acid at a specific position along a peptide sequence which is understood to provide a contact point between the immunogenic peptide and the HLA molecule. One to three, usually two, primary anchor residues within a peptide of defined length generally defines a \"motif\" for an immunogenic peptide. These residues are understood to fit in close contact with peptide binding groove of an HLA molecule, with their side chains buried in specific pockets of the binding groove. In one embodiment, for example, the primary anchor residues for an HLA class I molecule are located at position 2 (from the amino terminal position) and at the carboxyl terminal position of a 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 residue peptide epitope in accordance with the invention. Alternatively, in another embodiment, the primary anchor residues of a peptide binds an HLA class II molecule are spaced relative to each other, rather than to the termini of a peptide, where the peptide is generally of at least 9 amino acids in length. The primary anchor positions for each motif and supermotif are set forth in Table IV(a). For example, analog peptides can be created by altering the presence or absence of particular residues in the primary and/or secondary anchor positions shown in Table IV. Such analogs are used to modulate the binding affinity and/or population coverage of a peptide comprising a particular HLA motif or supermotif.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Radioisotopes\" include, but are not limited to the following (non-limiting exemplary uses are also set forth in Table IV(I)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"randomized\" or grammatical equivalents as herein applied to nucleic acids and proteins is meant that each nucleic acid and peptide consists of essentially random nucleotides and amino acids, respectively. These random peptides (or nucleic acids, discussed herein) can incorporate any nucleotide or amino acid at any position. The synthetic process can be designed to generate randomized proteins or nucleic acids, to allow the formation of all or most of the possible combinations over the length of the sequence, thus forming a library of randomized candidate bioactive proteinaceous agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a library is \"fully randomized,\" with no sequence preferences or constants at any position. In another embodiment, the library is a \"biased random\" library. That is, some positions within the sequence either are held constant, or are selected from a limited number of possibilities. For example, the nucleotides or amino acid residues are randomized within a defined class, \ne.g.\n, of hydrophobic amino acids, hydrophilic residues, sterically biased (either small or large) residues, towards the creation of nucleic acid binding domains, the creation of cysteines, for cross-linking, prolines for SH-3 domains, serines, threonines, tyrosines or histidines for phosphorylation sites, etc., or to purines, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"recombinant\" DNA or RNA molecule is a DNA or RNA molecule that has been subjected to molecular manipulation \nin vitro\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"single-chain Fv\" or \"scFv\" or \"single chain\" antibody refers to antibody fragments comprising the V\nH\n and V\nL\n domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V\nH\n and V\nL\n domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv, see \nPluckthun, THE PHARMACOLOGY OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-limiting examples of \"small molecules\" include compounds that bind or interact with PSCA, ligands including hormones, neuropeptides, chemokines, odorants, phospholipids, and functional equivalents thereof that bind and preferably inhibit PSCA protein function. Such non-limiting small molecules preferably have a molecular weight of less than about 10 kDa, more preferably below about 9, about 8, about 7, about 6, about 5 or about 4 kDa. In certain embodiments, small molecules physically associate with, or bind, PSCA protein; are not found in naturally occurring metabolic pathways; and/or are more soluble in aqueous than non-aqueous solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"specific\" refers to the selective binding of the antibody to the target antigen epitope. Antibodies can be tested for specificity of binding by comparing binding to appropriate antigen to binding to irrelevant antigen or antigen mixture under a given set of conditions. If the antibody binds to the appropriate antigen at least 2, 5, 7, and preferably 10 times more than to irrelevant antigen or antigen mixture then it is considered to be specific. In one embodiment, a specific antibody is one that only binds the PSCA antigen, but does not bind to the irrelevent antigen. In another embodiment, a specific antibody is one that binds human PSCA antigen but does not bind a non-human PSCA antigen with 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or greater amino acid homology with the PSCA antigen. In another embodiment, a specific antibody is one that binds human PSCA antigen and binds murine PSCA antigen, but with a higher degree of binding the human antigen. In another embodiment, a specific antibody is one that binds human PSCA antigen and binds primate PSCA antigen, but with a higher degree of binding the human antigen. In another embodiment, the specific antibody binds to human PSCA antigen and any non-human PSCA antigen, but with a higher degree of binding the human antigen or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Stringency\" of hybridization reactions is readily determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art, and generally is an empirical calculation dependent upon probe length, washing temperature, and salt concentration. In general, longer probes require higher temperatures for proper annealing, while shorter probes need lower temperatures. Hybridization generally depends on the ability of denatured nucleic acid sequences to reanneal when complementary strands are present in an environment below their melting temperature. The higher the degree of desired homology between the probe and hybridizable sequence, the higher the relative temperature that can be used. As a result, it follows that higher relative temperatures would tend to make the reaction conditions more stringent, while lower temperatures less so. For additional details and explanation of stringency of hybridization reactions, see \nAusubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Interscience Publishers, (1995\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Stringent conditions\" or \"high stringency conditions\", as defined herein, are identified by, but not limited to, those that: (1) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example 0.015 M sodium chloride/0.0015 M sodium citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50°C; (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 50% (v/v) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Ficoll/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone/50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM sodium citrate at 42°C; or (3) employ 50% formamide, 5 x SSC (0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5 x Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 µg/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42°C, with washes at 42°C in 0.2 x SSC (sodium chloride/sodium. citrate) and 50% formamide at 55°C, followed by a high-stringency wash consisting of 0.1 x SSC containing EDTA at 55°C. \"Moderately stringent conditions\" are described by, but not limited to, those in \nSambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, New York: Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1989\n, and include the use of washing solution and hybridization conditions (e.g., temperature, ionic strength and %SDS) less stringent than those described above. An example of moderately stringent conditions is overnight incubation at 65°C in a solution comprising: 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5M sodium phosphate pH7.5, 1.25mM EDTA, and 7% SDS 5 x SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), followed by washing the filters in 2 x SSC/1% SDS at 50°C and 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 50°C. The skilled artisan will recognize how to adjust the temperature, ionic strength, etc. as necessary to accommodate factors such as probe length and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn HLA \"supermotif\" is a peptide binding specificity shared by HLA molecules encoded by two or more HLA alleles. Overall phenotypic frequencies of HLA-supertypes in different ethnic populations are set forth in Table IV (f). The non-limiting constituents of various supertypes are as follows:\n\n \n \n \nA2: A*0201, A*0202, A*0203, A*0204, A* 0205, A*0206, A*6802, A*6901, A*0207\n \nA3: A3, A11, A31, A*3301, A*6801, A*0301, A*1101, A*3101\n \nB7: B7, B*3501-03, B*51, B*5301, B*5401, B*5501, B*5502, B*5601, B*6701, B*7801, B*0702, B*5101, B*5602\n \nB44: B*3701, B*4402, B*4403, B*60 (B*4001), B61 (B*4006)\n \nA1: A*0102, A*2604, A*3601, A*4301, A*8001\n \nA24: A*24, A*30, A*2403, A*2404, A*3002, A*3003\n \nB27: B*1401-02, B*1503, B*1509, B*1510, B*1518, B*3801-02, B*3901, B*3902, B*3903-04, B*4801-02, B*7301, B*2701-08\n \nB58: B*1516, B*1517, B*5701, B*5702, B58\n \nB62: B*4601, B52, B*1501 (B62), B*1502 (B75), B*1513 (B77)\n \n\nCalculated population coverage afforded by different HLA-supertype combinations are set forth in Table IV(g).\n    \n \n \n \nAs used herein \"to treat\" or \"therapeutic\" and grammatically related terms, refer to any improvement of any consequence of disease, such as prolonged survival, less morbidity, and/or a lessening of side effects which are the byproducts of an alternative therapeutic modality; as is readily appreciated in the art, full eradication of disease is a preferred out albeit not a requirement for a treatment act.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"transgenic animal\" (\ne.g.\n, a mouse or rat) is an animal having cells that contain a transgene, which transgene was introduced into the animal or an ancestor of the animal at a prenatal, \ne.g.\n, an embryonic stage. A \"transgene\" is a DNA that is integrated into the genome of a cell from which a transgenic animal develops.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an HLA or cellular immune response \"vaccine\" is a composition that contains or encodes one or more peptides of the invention. There are numerous embodiments of such vaccines, such as a cocktail of one or more individual peptides; one or more peptides of the invention comprised by a polyepitopic peptide; or nucleic acids that encode such individual peptides or polypeptides, \ne.g.\n, a minigene that encodes a polyepitopic peptide. The \"one or more peptides\" can include any whole unit integer from 1-150 or more, \ne.g.\n, at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, or 150 or more peptides of the invention. The peptides or polypeptides can optionally be modified, such as by lipidation, addition of targeting or other sequences. HLA class I peptides of the invention can be admixed with, or linked to, HLA class II peptides, to facilitate activation of both cytotoxic T lymphocytes and helper T lymphocytes. HLA vaccines can also comprise peptide-pulsed antigen presenting cells, \ne.g.\n, dendritic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"variant\" refers to a molecule that exhibits a variation from a described type or norm, such as a protein that has one or more different amino acid residues in the corresponding position(s) of a specifically described protein (\ne.g.\n the PSCA protein shown in \nFigure 1\n. An analog is an example of a variant protein. Splice isoforms and single nucleotides polymorphisms (SNPs) are further examples of variants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \"PSCA-related proteins\" of the invention include those specifically identified herein, as well as allelic variants, conservative substitution variants, analogs and homologs that can be isolated/generated and characterized without undue experimentation following the methods outlined herein or readily available in the art. Fusion proteins that combine parts of different PSCA proteins or fragments thereof, as well as fusion proteins of a PSCA protein and a heterologous polypeptide are also included. Such PSCA proteins are collectively referred to as the PSCA-related proteins, the proteins of the invention, or PSCA. The term \"PSCA-related protein\" refers to a polypeptide fragment or a PSCA protein sequence of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, or more than 25 amino acids; or, at least 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150, 155, 160, 165, 170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 330, 335, 339 or more amino acids.\n\n\n \nII.) PSCA Polynucleotides\n\n\n \n \n \nOne aspect of the invention provides polynucleotides corresponding or complementary to all or part of a PSCA gene, mRNA, and/or coding sequence, preferably in isolated form, including polynucleotides encoding a PSCA-related protein and fragments thereof, DNA, RNA, DNA/RNA hybrid, and related molecules, polynucleotides or oligonucleotides complementary to a PSCA gene or mRNA sequence or a part thereof, and polynucleotides or oligonucleotides that hybridize to a PSCA gene, mRNA, or to a PSCA encoding polynucleotide (collectively, \"PSCA polynucleotides\"). In all instances when referred to in this section, T can also be U in \nFigure 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmbodiments of a PSCA polynucleotide include: a PSCA polynucleotide having the sequence shown in \nFigure 1\n, the nucleotide sequence of PSCA as shown in \nFigure 1\n wherein T is U; at least 10 contiguous nucleotides of a polynucleotide having the sequence as shown in \nFigure 1\n; or, at least 10 contiguous nucleotides of a polynucleotide having the sequence as shown in \nFigure 1\n where T is U.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolynucleotides encoding relatively long portions of a PSCA protein are also within the scope of the invention. For example, polynucleotides encoding from about amino acid 1 (or 20 or 30 or 40 etc.) to about \namino acid\n 20, (or 30, or 40 or 50 etc.) of the PSCA protein \"or variant\" shown in \nFigure 1\n or \nFigure 3\n can be generated by a variety of techniques well known in the art. These polynucleotide fragments can include any portion of the PSCA sequence as shown in \nFigure 1\n.\n\n \n \n \nII.A.) Uses of PSCA Polynucleotides\n\n \nII.A.1. Monitoring of Genetic Abnormalities\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe polynucleotides of the preceding paragraphs have a number of different specific uses. The human PSCA gene maps to the chromosomal location set forth in the Example entitled \"chromosomal Mapping of PSCA.\" For example, because the PSCA gene maps to this chromosome, polynucleotides that encode different regions of the PSCA proteins are used to characterize cytogenetic abnormalities of this chromosomal locale, such as abnormalities that are identified as being associated with various cancers. In certain genes, a variety of chromosomal abnormalities including rearrangements have been identified as frequent cytogenetic abnormalities in a number of different cancers (see e.g. \nKrajinovic et al., Mutat. Res. 382(3-4): 81-83 (1998\n); \nJohansson et al., Blood 86(10): 3905-3914 (1995\n) and \nFinger et al., P.N.A.S. 85(23): 9158-9162 (1988\n)). Thus, polynucleotides encoding specific regions of the PSCA proteins provide new tools that can be used to delineate, with greater precision than previously possible, cytogenetic abnormalities in the chromosomal region that encodes PSCA that may contribute to the malignant phenotype. In this context, these polynucleotides satisfy a need in the art for expanding the sensitivity of chromosomal screening in order to identify more subtle and less common chromosomal abnormalities (see \ne.g.\n \nEvans et al., Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol 171(4): 1055-1057 (1994\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, as PSCA was shown to be highly expressed in prostate and other cancers, PSCA polynucleotides are used in methods assessing the status of PSCA gene products in normal versus cancerous tissues. Typically, polynucleotides that encode specific regions of the PSCA proteins are used to assess the presence of perturbations (such as deletions, insertions, point mutations, or alterations resulting in a loss of an antigen etc.) in specific regions of the PSCA gene, such as regions containing one or more motifs. Exemplary assays include both RT-PCR assays as well as single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis (see, \ne.g.\n, \nMarrogi et al., J. Cutan. Pathol. 26(8): 369-378 (1999\n), both of which utilize polynucleotides encoding specific regions of a protein to examine these regions within the protein.\n\n\n \nII.A.2. Antisense Embodiments\n\n\n \n \n \nOther specifically contemplated nucleic acid related embodiments of the invention disclosed herein are genomic DNA, cDNAs, ribozymes, and antisense molecules, as well as nucleic acid molecules based on an alternative backbone, or including alternative bases, whether derived from natural sources or synthesized, and include molecules capable of inhibiting the RNA or protein expression of PSCA. For example, antisense molecules can be RNAs or other molecules, including peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) or non-nucleic acid molecules such as phosphorothioate derivatives that specifically bind DNA or RNA in a base pair-dependent manner. A skilled artisan can readily obtain these classes of nucleic acid molecules using the PSCA polynucleotides and polynucleotide sequences disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntisense technology entails the administration of exogenous oligonucleotides that bind to a target polynucleotide located within the cells. The term \"antisense\" refers to the fact that such oligonucleotides are complementary to their intracellular targets, \ne.g.\n, PSCA. See for example, \nJack Cohen, Oligodeoxynucleotides, Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, 1989\n; and \nSynthesis 1:1-5 (1988\n). The PSCA antisense oligonucleotides of the present invention include derivatives such as S-oligonucleotides (phosphorothioate derivatives or S-oligos, see, Jack Cohen, \nsupra\n), which exhibit enhanced cancer cell growth inhibitory action. S-oligos (nucleoside phosphorothioates) are isoelectronic analogs of an oligonucleotide (O-oligo) in which a nonbridging oxygen atom of the phosphate group is replaced by a sulfur atom. The S-oligos of the present invention can be prepared by treatment of the corresponding O-oligos with 3H-1,2-benzodithiol-3-one-1,1-dioxide, which is a sulfur transfer reagent. See, \ne.g.\n, \nIyer, R. P. et al., J. Org. Chem. 55:4693-4698 (1990\n); and \nIyer, R. P. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 112:1253-1254 (1990\n). Additional PSCA antisense oligonucleotides of the present invention include morpholino antisense oligonucleotides known in the art (see, \ne.g.\n, \nPartridge et al., 1996, Antisense & Nucleic Acid Drug Development 6: 169-175\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PSCA antisense oligonucleotides of the present invention typically can be RNA or DNA that is complementary to and stably hybridizes with the first 100 5' codons or last 100 3' codons of a PSCA genomic sequence or the corresponding mRNA. Absolute complementarity is not required, although high degrees of complementarity are preferred. Use of an oligonucleotide complementary to this region allows for the selective hybridization to PSCA mRNA and not to mRNA specifying other regulatory subunits of protein kinase. In one embodiment, PSCA antisense oligonucleotides of the present invention are 15 to 30-mer fragments of the antisense DNA molecule that have a sequence that hybridizes to PSCA mRNA. Optionally, PSCA antisense oligonucleotide is a 30-mer oligonucleotide that is complementary to a region in the first 10 5' codons or last 10 3' codons of PSCA. Alternatively, the antisense molecules are modified to employ ribozymes in the inhibition of PSCA expression, see, \ne.g.\n, \nL. A. Couture & D. T. Stinchcomb; Trends Genet 12: 510-515 (1996\n).\n\n\n \nII.A.3. Primers and Primer Pairs\n\n\n \n \n \nFurther specific embodiments of these nucleotides of the invention include primers and primer pairs, which allow the specific amplification of polynucleotides of the invention or of any specific parts thereof, and probes that selectively or specifically hybridize to nucleic acid molecules of the invention or to any part thereof. Probes can be labeled with a detectable marker, such as, for example, a radioisotope, fluorescent compound, bioluminescent compound, a chemiluminescent compound, metal chelator or enzyme. Such probes and primers are used to detect the presence of a PSCA polynucleotide in a sample and as a means for detecting a cell expressing a PSCA protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of such probes include polypeptides comprising all or part of the human PSCA cDNA sequence shown in \nFigure 1\n. Examples of primer pairs capable of specifically amplifying PSCA mRNAs are also described in the Examples. As will be understood by the skilled artisan, a great many different primers and probes can be prepared based on the sequences provided herein and used effectively to amplify and/or detect a PSCA mRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PSCA polynucleotides of the invention are useful for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to their use as probes and primers for the amplification and/or detection of the PSCA gene(s), mRNA(s), or fragments thereof; as reagents for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of prostate cancer and other cancers; as coding sequences capable of directing the expression of PSCA polypeptides; as tools for modulating or inhibiting the expression of the PSCA gene(s) and/or translation of the PSCA transcript(s); and as therapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes the use of any probe as described herein to identify and isolate a PSCA or PSCA related nucleic acid sequence from a naturally occurring source, such as humans or other mammals, as well as the isolated nucleic acid sequence per se, which would comprise all or most of the sequences found in the probe used.\n\n\n \nII.A.4. Isolation of PSCA-Encoding Nucleic Acid Molecules\n\n\n \n \n \nThe PSCA cDNA sequences described herein enable the isolation of other polynucleotides encoding PSCA gene product(s), as well as the isolation of polynucleotides encoding PSCA gene product homologs, alternatively spliced isoforms, allelic variants, and mutant forms of a PSCA gene product as well as polynucleotides that encode analogs of PSCA-related proteins. Various molecular cloning methods that can be employed to isolate full length cDNAs encoding a PSCA gene are well known (see, for example, \nSambrook, J. et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d edition, Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York, 1989\n; \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology. Ausubel et al., Eds., Wiley and Sons, 1995\n). For example, lambda phage cloning methodologies can be conveniently employed, using commercially available cloning systems (\ne.g.\n, Lambda ZAP Express, Stratagene). Phage clones containing PSCA gene cDNAs can be identified by probing with a labeled PSCA cDNA or a fragment thereof. For example, in one embodiment, a PSCA cDNA (\ne.g.\n, \nFigure 1\n) or a portion thereof can be synthesized and used as a probe to retrieve overlapping and full-length cDNAs corresponding to a PSCA gene. A PSCA gene itself can be isolated by screening genomic DNA libraries, bacterial artificial chromosome libraries (BACs), yeast artificial chromosome libraries (YACs), and the like, with PSCA DNA probes or primers.\n\n\n \nII.A.5. Recombinant Nucleic Acid Molecules and Host-Vector Systems\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also provides recombinant DNA or RNA molecules containing a PSCA polynucleotide, a fragment, analog or homologue thereof, including but not limited to phages, plasmids, phagemids, cosmids, YACs, BACs, as well as various viral and non-viral vectors well known in the art, and cells transformed or transfected with such recombinant DNA or RNA molecules. Methods for generating such molecules are well known (see, for example, Sambrook \net al.\n, 1989, \nsupra\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides a host-vector system comprising a recombinant DNA molecule containing a PSCA polynucleotide, fragment, analog or homologue thereof within a suitable prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell. Examples of suitable eukaryotic host cells include a yeast cell, a plant cell, or an animal cell, such as a mammalian cell or an insect cell (\ne.g.\n, a baculovirus-infectible cell such as an Sf9 or HighFive cell). Examples of suitable mammalian cells include various prostate cancer cell lines such as DU145 and TsuPr1, other transfectable or transducible prostate cancer cell lines, primary cells (PrEC), as well as a number of mammalian cells routinely used for the expression of recombinant proteins (\ne.g.\n, COS, CHO, 293, 293T cells). More particularly, a polynucleotide comprising the coding sequence of PSCA or a fragment, analog or homolog thereof can be used to generate PSCA proteins or fragments thereof using any number of host-vector systems routinely used and widely known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide range of host-vector systems suitable for the expression of PSCA proteins or fragments thereof are available, see for example, Sambrook \net al.\n, 1989, \nsupra\n; Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1995, \nsupra\n), Preferred vectors for mammalian expression include but are not limited to pcDNA 3.1 myc-His-tag (Invitrogen) and the retroviral vector pSR□tkneo (\nMuller et al., 1991, MCB 11:1785\n). Using these expression vectors, PSCA can be expressed in several prostate cancer and non-prostate cell lines, including for example 293, 293T, rat-1, NIH 3T3 and TsuPr1. The host-vector systems of the invention are useful for the production of a PSCA protein or fragment thereof. Such host-vector systems can be employed to study the functional properties of PSCA and PSCA mutations or analogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant human PSCA protein or an analog or homolog or fragment thereof can be produced by mammalian cells transfected with a construct encoding a PSCA-related nucleotide. For example, 293T cells can be transfected with an expression plasmid encoding PSCA or fragment, analog or homolog thereof, a PSCA-related protein is expressed in the 293T cells, and the recombinant PSCA protein is isolated using standard purification methods (\ne.g.\n, affinity purification using anti-PSCA antibodies). In another embodiment, a PSCA coding sequence is subcloned into the retroviral vector pSRαMSVtkneo and used to infect various mammalian cell lines, such as NIH 3T3, TsuPr1, 293 and rat-1 in order to establish PSCA expressing cell lines. Various other expression systems well known in the art can also be employed. Expression constructs encoding a leader peptide joined in frame to a PSCA coding sequence can be used for the generation of a secreted form of recombinant PSCA protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed herein, redundancy in the genetic code permits variation in PSCA gene sequences. In particular, it is known in the art that specific host species often have specific codon preferences, and thus one can adapt the disclosed sequence as preferred for a desired host. For example, preferred analog codon sequences typically have rare codons (\ni.e.\n, codons having a usage frequency of less than about 20% in known sequences of the desired host) replaced with higher frequency codons. Codon preferences for a specific species are calculated, for example, by utilizing codon usage tables available on the INTERNET such as at URL dna.affrc.go.jp/∼nakamura/codon.html.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional sequence modifications are known to enhance protein expression in a cellular host. These include elimination of sequences encoding spurious polyadenylation signals, exon/intron splice site signals, transposon-like repeats, and/or other such well-characterized sequences that are deleterious to gene expression. The GC content of the sequence is adjusted to levels average for a given cellular host, as calculated by reference to known genes expressed in the host cell. Where possible, the sequence is modified to avoid predicted hairpin secondary mRNA structures. Other useful modifications include the addition of a translational initiation consensus sequence at the start of the open reading frame, as described in \nKozak, Mol. Cell Biol., 9:5073-5080 (1989\n). Skilled artisans understand that the general rule that eukaryotic ribosomes initiate translation exclusively at the 5' proximal AUG codon is abrogated only under rare conditions (see, \ne.g.\n, \nKozak PNAS 92(7): 2662-2666, (1995\n) and \nKozak NAR 15(20): 8125-8148(1987\n)).\n\n\n \nIII.) PSCA-related Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention provides PSCA-related proteins. Specific embodiments of PSCA proteins comprise a polypeptide having all or part of the amino acid sequence of human PSCA as shown in \nFigure 1\n, preferably \nFigure 1A\n. Alternatively, embodiments of PSCA proteins comprise variant, homolog or analog polypeptides that have alterations in the amino acid sequence of PSCA shown in \nFigure 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmbodiments of a PSCA polypeptide include: a PSCA polypeptide having a sequence shown in \nFigure 1\n, a peptide sequence of a PSCA as shown in \nFigure 1\n wherein T is U; at least 10 contiguous nucleotides of a polypeptide having the sequence as shown in \nFigure 1\n; or, at least 10 contiguous peptides of a polypeptide having the sequence as shown in \nFigure 1\n where T is U.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid abbreviations are provided in Table II. Conservative amino acid substitutions can frequently be made in a protein without altering either the conformation or the function of the protein. Proteins of the invention can comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 conservative substitutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmbodiments of the invention disclosed herein include a wide variety of art-accepted variants or analogs of PSCA proteins such as polypeptides having amino acid insertions, deletions and substitutions. PSCA variants can be made using methods known in the art such as site-directed mutagenesis, alanine scanning, and PCR mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis (\nCarter et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 13:4331 (1986\n); \nZoller et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 10:6487 (1987\n)), cassette mutagenesis (\nWells et al., Gene, 34:315 (1985\n)), restriction selection mutagenesis (\nWells et al., Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London SerA, 317:41 (1986\n)) or other known techniques can be performed on the cloned DNA to produce the PSCA variant DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScanning amino acid analysis can also be employed to identify one or more amino acids along a contiguous sequence that is involved in a specific biological activity such as a protein-protein interaction. Among the preferred scanning amino acids are relatively small, neutral amino acids. Such amino acids include alanine, glycine, serine, and cysteine. Alanine is typically a preferred scanning amino acid among this group because it eliminates the side-chain beyond the beta-carbon and is less likely to alter the main-chain conformation of the variant. Alanine is also typically preferred because it is the most common amino acid. Further, it is frequently found in both buried and exposed positions (\nCreighton, The Proteins, (W.H. Freeman & Co., N.Y\n.); \nChothia, J. Mol. Biol., 150:1 (1976\n)). If alanine substitution does not yield adequate amounts of variant, an isosteric amino acid can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs defined herein, PSCA variants, analogs or homologs, have the distinguishing attribute of having at least one epitope that is \"cross reactive\" with a PSCA protein having an amino acid sequence of \nFigure 1\n. As used in this sentence, \"cross reactive\" means that an antibody or T cell that specifically binds to a PSCA variant also specifically binds to a PSCA protein having an amino acid sequence set forth in \nFigure 1\n. A polypeptide ceases to be a variant of a protein shown in \nFigure 1\n, when it no longer contains any epitope capable of being recognized by an antibody or T cell that specifically binds to the starting PSCA protein. Those skilled in the art understand that antibodies that recognize proteins bind to epitopes of varying size, and a grouping of the order of about four or five amino acids, contiguous or not, is regarded as a typical number of amino acids in a minimal epitope. See, e.g., \nNair et al., \n; \nHebbes et al., Mol Immunol (1989) 26(9):865-73\n; \nSchwartz et al., J Immunol (1985) 135(4):2598-608\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther classes of PSCA-related protein variants share 70%, 75%, 80%, 85% or 90% or more similarity with an amino acid sequence of \nFigure 1\n, or a fragment thereof. Another specific class of PSCA protein variants or analogs comprises one or more of the PSCA biological motifs described herein or presently known in the art. Thus, encompassed by the present invention are analogs of PSCA fragments (nucleic or amino acid) that have altered functional (\ne.g.\n immunogenic) properties relative to the starting fragment. It is to be appreciated that motifs now or which become part of the art are to be applied to the nucleic or amino acid sequences of \nFigure 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed herein, embodiments of the claimed invention include polypeptides containing less than the full amino acid sequence of a PSCA protein shown in \nFigure 1\n. For example, representative embodiments of the invention comprise peptides/proteins having any 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or more contiguous amino acids of a PSCA protein shown in \nFigure 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPSCA-related proteins are generated using standard peptide synthesis technology or using chemical cleavage methods well known in the art. Alternatively, recombinant methods can be used to generate nucleic acid molecules that encode a PSCA-related protein. In one embodiment, nucleic acid molecules provide a means to generate defined fragments of a PSCA protein (or variants, homologs or analogs thereof).\n\n\n \nIII.A.) Motif-bearing Protein Embodiments\n\n\n \n \n \nAdditional illustrative embodiments of the invention disclosed herein include PSCA polypeptides comprising the amino acid residues of one or more of the biological motifs contained within a PSCA polypeptide sequence set forth in \nFigure 1\n. Various motifs are known in the art, and a protein can be evaluated for the presence of such motifs by a number of publicly available Internet sites (see, \ne.g.\n, URL addresses: pfam.wustl.edu/; searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu/seq-search/struc-predict.html; psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/; ebs.dtu.dk/; ebi.ac.uk/interpro/scan.html; expasy.ch/tools/scnpsitl.html; Epimatrix™ and Epimer™, Brown University, brown.edu/Research/TB-HIV_Lab/epimatrix/epimatrix.html; and BIMAS, bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMotif bearing subsequences of all PSCA variant proteins are set forth and identified in Tables V-XVIII and XXII-LI.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable IV(h) sets forth several frequently occurring motifs based on pfam searches (see URL address pfam.wustl.edu/). The columns of Table IV(h) list (1) motif name abbreviation, (2) percent identity found amongst the different member of the motif family, (3) motif name or description and (4) most common function; location information is included if the motif is relevant for location.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides comprising one or more of the PSCA motifs discussed above are useful in elucidating the specific characteristics of a malignant phenotype in view of the observation that the PSCA motifs discussed above are associated with growth dysregulation and because PSCA is overexpressed in certain cancers (See, \ne.g.\n, Table I). Casein kinase II, cAMP and camp-dependent protein kinase, and Protein Kinase C, for example, are enzymes known to be associated with the development of the malignant phenotype (see \ne.g.\n \nChen et al., Lab Invest., 78(2): 165-174 (1998\n); \nGaiddon et al., Endocrinology 136(10): 4331-4338 (1995\n); \nHall et al., Nucleic Acids Research 24(6): 1119-1126 (1996\n); \nPeterziel et al., Oncogene 18(46): 6322-6329 (1999\n) and \nO'Brian, Oncol. Rep. 5(2): 305-309 (1998\n)). Moreover, both glycosylation and myristoylation are protein modifications also associated with cancer and cancer progression (see \ne.g.\n \nDennis et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1473(1):21-34 (1999\n); \nRaju et al., Exp. Cell Res. 235(1): 145-154 (1997\n)). Amidation is another protein modification also associated with cancer and cancer progression (see \ne.g.\n \nTreston et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. (13): 169-175 (1992\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, proteins of the invention comprise one or more of the immunoreactive epitopes identified in accordance with art-accepted methods, such as the peptides set forth in Tables V-XVIII and XXII-LI. CTL epitopes can be determined using specific algorithms to identify peptides within a PSCA protein that are capable of optimally binding to specified HLA alleles (\ne.g.\n, Table IV; Epimatrix™ and Epimer™, Brown University, URL brown.edu/Research/TB-HIV_Lab/epimatrix/epimatrix.html; and BIMAS, URL bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/.) Moreover, processes for identifying peptides that have sufficient binding affinity for HLA molecules and which are correlated with being immunogenic epitopes, are well known in the art, and are carried out without undue experimentation. In addition, processes for identifying peptides that are immunogenic epitopes, are well known in the art, and are carried out without undue experimentation either \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso known in the art are principles for creating analogs of such epitopes in order to modulate immunogenicity. For example, one begins with an epitope that bears a CTL or HTL motif (see, \ne.g.\n, the HLA Class I and HLA Class II motifs/supermotifs of Table IV). The epitope is analoged by substituting out an amino acid at one of the specified positions, and replacing it with another amino acid specified for that position. For example, on the basis of residues defined in Table IV, one can substitute out a deleterious residue in favor of any other residue, such as a preferred residue; substitute a less-preferred residue with a preferred residue; or substitute an originally-occurring preferred residue with another preferred residue. Substitutions can occur at primary anchor positions or at other positions in a peptide; see, \ne.g.\n, Table IV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of references reflect the art regarding the identification and generation of epitopes in a protein of interest as well as analogs thereof. See, for example, \n \nWO 97/33602 to Chesnut et al.\n \n; \nSette, Immunogenetics 1999 50(3-4): 201-212\n; \nSette et al., J. Immunol. 2001 166(2): 1389-1397\n; \nSidney et al., Hum. Immunol. 1997 58(1): 12-20\n; \nKondo et al., Immunogenetics 1997 45(4): 249-258\n; \nSidney et al., J. Immunol. 1996 157(8): 3480-90\n; and \nFalk et al., Nature 351: 290-6 (1991\n); \nHunt et al., Science 255:1261-3 (1992\n); \nParker et al., J. Immunol. 149:3580-7 (1992\n); \nParker et al., J. Immunol. 152:163-75 (1994\n)); \nKast et al., 1994 152(8): 3904-12\n; \nBorras-Cuesta et al., Hum. Immunol. 2000 61(3): 266-278\n; \nAlexander et al., J. Immunol. 2000 164(3); 164(3): 1625-1633\n; \nAlexander et al., PMID: 7895164, UI: 95202582\n; \nO'Sullivan et al., J. Immunol. 1991 147(8): 2663-2669\n; \nAlexander et al., Immunity 1994 1(9): 751-761\n and \nAlexander et al., Immunol. Res. 1998 18(2): 79-92\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelated embodiments of the invention include polypeptides comprising combinations of the different motifs set forth in Table(s) IV(a), IV(b), IV(c), IV(d), and IV(h), and/or, one or more of the predicted CTL epitopes of Tables V-XVIII and XXII-LI, and/or, one or more of the predicted HTL epitopes of Tables XLVIII-LI, and/or, one or more of the T cell binding motifs known in the art. Preferred embodiments contain no insertions, deletions or substitutions either within the motifs or within the intervening sequences of the polypeptides. In addition, embodiments which include a number of either N-terminal and/or C-terminal amino acid residues on either side of these motifs may be desirable (to, for example, include a greater portion of the polypeptide architecture in which the motif is located). Typically, the number of N-terminal and/or C-terminal amino acid residues on either side of a motif is between about 1 to about 100 amino acid residues, preferably 5 to about 50 amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPSCA-related proteins are embodied in many forms, preferably in isolated form. A purified PSCA protein molecule will be substantially free of other proteins or molecules that impair the binding of PSCA to antibody, T cell or other ligand. The nature and degree of isolation and purification will depend on the intended use. Embodiments of a PSCA-related proteins include purified PSCA-related proteins and functional, soluble PSCA-related proteins. In one embodiment, a functional, soluble PSCA protein or fragment thereof retains the ability to be bound by antibody, T cell or other ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides PSCA proteins comprising biologically active fragments of a PSCA amino acid sequence shown in \nFigure 1\n. Such proteins exhibit properties of the starting PSCA protein, such as the ability to elicit the generation of antibodies that specifically bind an epitope associated with the starting PSCA protein; to be bound by such antibodies; to elicit the activation of HTL or CTL; and/or, to be recognized by HTL or CTL that also specifically bind to the starting protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPSCA-related polypeptides that contain particularly interesting structures can be predicted and/or identified using various analytical techniques well known in the art, including, for example, the methods of Chou-Fasman, Garnier-Robson, Kyte-Doolittle, Eisenberg, Karplus-Schultz or Jameson-Wolf analysis, or based on immunogenicity. Fragments that contain such structures are particularly useful in generating subunit-specific anti-PSCA antibodies or T cells or in identifying cellular factors that bind to PSCA. For example, hydrophilicity profiles can be generated, and immunogenic peptide fragments identified, using the method af \nHopp, T.P. and Woods, K.R., 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78;3824-3828\n. Hydropathicity profiles can be generated, and immunogenic peptide fragments identified, using the method of \nKyte, J. and Doolittle, R.F., 1982, J. Mol. Biol. 157:105-132\n. Percent (%) Accessible Residues profiles can be generated, and immunogenic peptide fragments identified, using the method of \nJanin J., 1979, Nature 277:491-492\n. Average Flexibility profiles can be generated, and immunogenic peptide fragments identified, using the method of Bhaskaran R., \nPonnuswamy P.K., 1988, Int. J. Pept. Protein Res, 32:242-255\n. Beta-turn profiles can be generated, and immunogenic peptide fragments identified, using the method of \nDeleage, G., Roux B., 1987, Protein Engineering 1:289-294\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCTL epitopes can be determined using specific algorithms to identify peptides within a PSCA protein that are capable of optimally binding to specified HLA alleles (\ne.g.\n, by using the SYFPEITHI site at World Wide Web URL syfpeithi.bmi-heidelberg.com/; the listings in Table IV(A)-(E); Epimatrix™ and Epimer™, Brown University, URL (brown.edu/Research/TB-HIV_Lab/epimatrix/epimatrix.html); and BIMAS, URL bimas.dert.nih.govl). Illustrating this, peptide epitopes from PSCA that are presented in the context of human MHC Class I molecules, \ne.g.\n, HLA-A1, A2, A3, A11, A24, B7 and B35 were predicted (see, \ne.g.\n, Tables V-XVIII, XXII-LI). Specifically, the complete amino acid sequence of the PSCA protein and relevant portions of other variants, \ni.e.\n, for HLA Class I \npredictions\n 9 flanking residues on either side of a point mutation or exon junction, and for HLA \nClass II predictions\n 14 flanking residues on either side of a point mutation or exon junction corresponding to that variant, were entered into the HLA Peptide Motif Search algorithm found in the Bioinformatics and Molecular Analysis Section (BIMAS) web site listed above; in addition to the site SYFPEITHI, at URL syfpeithi.bmi-heidelberg.com/.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HLA peptide motif search algorithm was developed by Dr. Ken Parker based on binding of specific peptide sequences in the groove of HLA Class I molecules, in particular HLA-A2 (see, \ne.g.\n, \nFalk et al., Nature 351: 290-6 (1991\n); \nHunt et al., Science 255:1261-3 (1992\n); \nParker et al., J. Immunol. 149:3580-7 (1992\n); \nParker et al., J. Immunol. 152:163-75 (1994\n)). This algorithm allows location and ranking of 8-mer, 9-mer, and 10-mer peptides from a complete protein sequence for predicted binding to HLA-A2 as well as numerous other HLA Class I molecules. Many HLA class I binding peptides are 8-, 9-, 10 or 11-mers. For example, for Class I HLA-A2, the epitopes preferably contain a leucine (L) or methionine (M) at \nposition\n 2 and a valine (V) or leucine (L) at the C-terminus (see, \ne.g.\n, \nParker et al., J. Immunol. 149:3580-7 (1992\n)). Selected results of PSCA predicted binding peptides are shown in Tables V-XVIII and XXII-LI herein. In Tables V-XVIII and XXII-XLVIII, selected candidates, 9-mers and 10-mers, for each family member are shown along with their location, the amino acid sequence of each specific peptide, and an estimated binding score. In Tables XLVIII-LI, selected candidates, 15-mers, for each family member are shown along with their location, the amino acid sequence of each specific peptide, and an estimated binding score. The binding score corresponds to the estimated half time of dissociation of complexes containing the peptide at 37°C at pH 6.5. Peptides with the highest binding score are predicted to be the most tightly bound to HLA Class I on the cell surface for the greatest period of time and thus represent the best immunogenic targets for T-cell recognition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActual binding of peptides to an HLA allele can be evaluated by stabilization of HLA expression on the antigen-processing defective cell line T2 (see, \ne.g.\n, \nXue et al., Prostate 30:73-8 (1997\n) and \nPeshwa et al., Prostate 36:129-38 (1998\n)). Immunogenicity of specific peptides can be evaluated \nin vitro\n by stimulation of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in the presence of antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be appreciated that every epitope predicted by the BIMAS site, Epimer™ and Epimatrix™ sites, or specified by the HLA class I or class II motifs available in the art or which become part of the art such as set forth in Table IV (or determined using World Wide Web site URL syfpeithi.bmi-heidelberg.com/, or BIMAS, bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/) are to be \"applied\" to a PSCA protein in accordance with the invention. As used in this context \"applied\" means that a PSCA protein is evaluated, \ne.g.\n, visually or by computer-based patterns finding methods, as appreciated by those of skill in the relevant art. Every subsequence of a PSCA protein of 8, 9, 10, or 11 amino acid residues that bears an HLA Class I motif, or a subsequence of 9 or more amino acid residues that bear an HLA Class II motif are within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \nIII.B.) Expression of PSCA-related Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nIn an embodiment described in the examples that follow, PSCA can be conveniently expressed in cells (such as 293T cells) transfected with a commercially available expression vector such as a CMV-driven expression vector encoding PSCA with a C-terminal 6XHis and MYC tag (pcDNA3.1/mycHIS, Invitrogen or Tag5, GenHunter Corporation, Nashville TN). The Tag5 vector provides an IgGK secretion signal that can be used to facilitate the production of a secreted PSCA protein in transfected cells. The secreted HIS-tagged PSCA in the culture media can be purified, e.g., using a nickel column using standard techniques.\n\n\n \nIII.C.) Modifications of PSCA-related Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nModifications of PSCA-related proteins such as covalent modifications are included within the scope of this invention. One type of covalent modification includes reacting targeted amino acid residues of a PSCA polypeptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C- terminal residues of a PSCA protein. Another type of covalent modification of a PSCA polypeptide included within the scope of this invention comprises altering the native glycosylation pattern of a protein of the invention. Another type of covalent modification of PSCA comprises linking a PSCA polypeptide to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, \ne.g.\n, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes, in the manner set forth in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 4,640,835\n \n; \n \n4,496,689\n \n; \n \n4,301,144\n \n; \n \n4,670,417\n \n; \n \n4,791,192\n \n or \n \n4,179,337\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PSCA-related proteins of the present invention can also be modified to form a chimeric molecule comprising PSCA fused to another, heterologous polypeptide or amino acid sequence. Such a chimeric molecule can be synthesized chemically or recombinantly. A chimeric molecule can have a protein of the invention fused to another tumor-associated antigen or fragment thereof, Alternatively, a protein in accordance with the invention can comprise a fusion of fragments of a PSCA sequence (amino or nucleic acid) such that a molecule is created that is not, through its length, directly homologous to the amino or nucleic acid sequences shown in \nFigure 1\n. Such a chimeric molecule can comprise multiples of the same subsequence of PSCA. A chimeric molecule can comprise a fusion of a PSCA-related protein with a polyhistidine epitope tag, which provides an epitope to which immobilized nickel can selectively bind, with cytokines or with growth factors. The epitope tag is generally placed at the amino- or carboxyl- terminus of a PSCA protein. In an alternative embodiment, the chimeric molecule can comprise a fusion of a PSCA-related protein with an immunoglobulin or a particular region of an immunoglobulin. For a bivalent form of the chimeric molecule (also referred to as an \"immunoadhesin\"), such a fusion could be to the Fc region of an IgG molecule. The Ig fusions preferably include the substitution of a soluble (transmembrane domain deleted or inactivated) form of a PSCA polypeptide in place of at least one variable region within an Ig molecule. In a preferred embodiment, the immunoglobulin fusion includes the hinge, CH2 and CH3, or the hinge, CHI, CH2 and CH3 regions of an IgGI molecule. For the production of immunoglobulin fusions see, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,428,130 issued June 27, 1995\n \n.\n\n\n \nIII.D.) Uses of PSCA-related Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nThe proteins of the invention have a number of different specific uses. As PSCA is highly expressed in prostate and other cancers, PSCA-related proteins are used in methods that assess the status of PSCA gene products in normal versus cancerous tissues, thereby elucidating the malignant phenotype. Typically, polypeptides from specific regions of a PSCA protein are used to assess the presence of perturbations (such as deletions, insertions, point mutations etc.) in those regions (such as regions containing one or more motifs). Exemplary assays utilize antibodies or T cells targeting PSCA-related proteins comprising the amino acid residues of one or more of the biological motifs contained within a PSCA polypeptide sequence in order to evaluate the characteristics of this region in normal versus cancerous tissues or to elicit an immune response to the epitope. Alternatively, PSCA-related proteins that contain the amino acid residues of one or more of the biological motifs in a PSCA protein are used to screen for factors that interact with that region of PSCA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPSCA protein fragments/subsequences are particularly useful in generating and characterizing domain-specific antibodies (\ne.g.\n, antibodies recognizing an extracellular or intracellular epitope of a PSCA protein), for identifying agents or cellular factors that bind to PSCA or a particular structural domain thereof, and in various therapeutic and diagnostic contexts, including but not limited to diagnostic assays, cancer vaccines and methods of preparing such vaccines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProteins encoded by the PSCA genes, or by analogs, homologs or fragments thereof, have a variety of uses, including but not limited to generating antibodies and in methods for identifying ligands and other agents and cellular constituents that bind to a PSCA gene product. Antibodies raised against a PSCA protein or fragment thereof are useful in diagnostic and prognostic assays, and imaging methodologies in the management of human cancers characterized by expression of PSCA protein, such as those listed in Table I. Such antibodies can be expressed intracellularly and used in methods of treating patients with such cancers. PSCA-related nucleic acids or proteins are also used in generating HTL or CTL responses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious immunological assays useful for the detection of PSCA proteins are used, including but not limited to various types of radioimmunoassays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), enzyme-linked immunofluorescent assays (ELIFA), immunocytochemical methods, and the like. Antibodies can be labeled and used as immunological imaging reagents capable of detecting PSCA-expressing cells (\ne.g.\n, in radioscintigraphic imaging methods). PSCA proteins are also particularly useful in generating cancer vaccines, as further described herein.\n\n\n \nIV.) PSCA Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention provides antibodies that bind to PSCA-related proteins. Preferred antibodies specifically bind to a PSCA-related protein and do not bind (or bind weakly) to peptides or proteins that are not PSCA-related proteins under physiological conditions. In this context, examples of physiological conditions include: 1) phosphate buffered saline; 2) Tris-buffered saline containing 25mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl; or normal saline (0.9% NaCl); 4) animal serum such as human serum; or, 5) a combination of any of 1) through 4); these reactions preferably taking place at pH 7.5, alternatively in a range of pH 7.0 to 8.0, or alternatively in a range of pH 6.5 to 8.5; also, these reactions taking place at a temperature between 4°C to 37°C. For example, antibodies that bind PSCA can bind PSCA-related proteins such as the homologs or analogs thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPSCA antibodies of the invention are particularly useful in cancer (see, \ne.g.\n, Table I) diagnostic and prognostic assays, and imaging methodologies. Similarly, such antibodies are useful in the treatment, diagnosis, and/or prognosis of prostate and other cancers, to the extent PSCA is also expressed or overexpressed in these other cancers. Moreover, intracellularly expressed antibodies (\ne.g.\n, single chain antibodies) are therapeutically useful in treating cancers in which the expression of PSCA is involved, such as advanced or metastatic prostate cancers or other advanced or metastatic cacners.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides various immunological assays useful for the detection and quantification of PSCA and mutant PSCA-related proteins. Such assays can comprise one or more PSCA antibodies capable of recognizing and binding a PSCA-related protein, as appropriate. These assays are performed within various immunological assay formats well known in the art, including but not limited to various types of radioimmunoassays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), enzyme-linked immunofluorescent assays (ELIFA), and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunological non-antibody assays of the invention also comprise T cell immunogenicity assays (inhibitory or stimulatory) as well as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, immunological imaging methods capable of detecting prostate cancer and other cancers expressing PSCA are also provided by the invention, including but not limited to radioscintigraphic imaging methods using labeled PSCA antibodies. Such assays are clinically useful in the detection, monitoring, and prognosis of PSCA expressing cancers such as prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPSCA antibodies are also used in methods for purifying a PSCA-related protein and for isolating PSCA homologues and related molecules. For example, a method of purifying a PSCA-related protein comprises incubating a PSCA antibody, which has been coupled to a solid matrix, with a lysate or other solution containing a PSCA-related protein under conditions that permit the PSCA antibody to bind to the PSCA-related protein; washing the solid matrix to eliminate impurities; and eluting the PSCA-related protein from the coupled antibody. Other uses of PSCA antibodies in accordance with the invention include generating anti-idiotypic antibodies that mimic a PSCA protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious methods for the preparation of antibodies are well known in the art. For example, antibodies can be prepared by immunizing a suitable mammalian host using a PSCA-related protein, peptide, or fragment, in isolated or immunoconjugated form (\nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual, CSH Press, Eds., Harlow, and Lane (1988\n); \nHarlow, Antibodies, Cold Spring Harbor Press, NY (1989\n)). In addition, fusion proteins of PSCA can also be used, such as a PSCA GST-fusion protein. In a particular embodiment, a GST fusion protein comprising all or most of the amino acid sequence of \nFigure 1\n is produced, then used as an immunogen to generate appropriate antibodies. In another embodiment, a PSCA-related protein is synthesized and used as an immunogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, naked DNA immunization techniques known in the art are used (with or without purified PSCA-related protein or PSCA expressing cells) to generate an immune response to the encoded immunogen (for review, see \nDonnelly et al., 1997, Ann. Rev. Immunol, 15:617-648\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequence of a PSCA protein as shown in \nFigure 1\n can be analyzed to select specific regions of the PSCA protein for generating antibodies. For example, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity analyses of a PSCA amino acid sequence are used to identify hydrophilic regions in the PSCA structure. Regions of a PSCA protein that show immunogenic structure, as well as other regions and domains, can readily be identified using various other methods known in the art, such as Chou-Fasman, Garnier-Robson, Kyte-Doolittle, Eisenberg, Karplus-Schultz or Jameson-Wolf analysis. Hydrophilicity profiles can be generated using the method of \nHopp, T.P. and Woods, K.R., 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:3824-3828\n. Hydropathicity profiles can be generated using the method of \nKyte, J. and Doolittle, R.F., 1982, J. Mol. Biol. 157:105-132\n. Percent (%) Accessible Residues profiles can be generated using the method of \nJanin J., 1979, Nature 277:491-492\n. Average Flexibility profiles can be generated using the method of \nBhaskaran R., Ponnuswamy P.K., 1988, Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 32:242-255\n. Beta-turn profiles can be generated using the method of \nDeleage, G., Roux B., 1987, Protein Engineering 1:289-294\n. Thus, each region identified by any of these programs or methods is within the scope of the present invention. Preferred methods for the generation of PSCA antibodies are further illustrated by way of the examples provided herein. Methods for preparing a protein or polypeptide for use as an immunogen are well known in the art. Also well known in the art are methods for preparing immunogenic conjugates of a protein with a carrier, such as BSA, KLH or other carrier protein. In some circumstances, direct conjugation using, for example, carbodiimide reagents are used;.in other instances linking reagents such as those supplied by Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL, are effective. Administration of a PSCA immunogen is often conducted by injection over a suitable time period and with use of a suitable adjuvant, as is understood in the art. During the immunization schedule, titers of antibodies can be taken to determine adequacy of antibody formation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPSCA monoclonal antibodies can be produced by various means well known in the art. For example, immortalized cell lines that secrete a desired monoclonal antibody are prepared using the standard hybridoma technology of Kohler and Milstein or modifications that immortalize antibody-producing B cells, as is generally known. Immortalized cell lines that secrete the desired antibodies are screened by immunoassay in which the antigen is a PSCA-related protein. When the appropriate immortalized cell culture is identified, the cells can be expanded and antibodies produced either from \nin vitro\n cultures or from ascites fluid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies or fragments of the invention can also be produced, by recombinant means. Regions that bind specifically to the desired regions of a PSCA protein can also be produced in the context of chimeric or complementarity-determining region (CDR) grafted antibodies of multiple species origin. Humanized or human PSCA antibodies can also be produced, and are preferred for use in therapeutic contexts. Methods for humanizing murine and other non-human antibodies, by substituting one or more of the non-human antibody CDRs for corresponding human antibody sequences, are well known (see for example, \nJones et al., 1986, Nature 321: 522-525\n; \nRiechmann et al., 1988, Nature 332: 323-327\n; \nVerhoeyen et al., 1988, Science 239: 1534-1536\n). See also, \nCarter et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 4285 \nand \nSims et al., 1993, J. Immunol. 151: 2296\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for producing fully human monoclonal antibodies include phage display and transgenic methods (for review, see \nVaughan et al., 1998, Nature Biotechnology 16: 535-539\n). Fully human PSCA monoclonal antibodies can be generated using cloning technologies employing large human Ig gene combinatorial libraries (\ni.e.\n, phage display) (Griffiths and Hoogenboom, Building an \nin vitro\n immune system: human antibodies from phage display libraries. In: \nProtein Engineering of Antibody Molecules for Prophylactic and Therapeutic Applications in Man, Clark, M. (Ed.), Nottingham Academic, pp 45-64 (1993\n); Burton and Barbas, Human Antibodies from combinatorial libraries. \nId.\n, pp 65-82). Fully human PSCA monoclonal antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice engineered to contain human immunoglobulin gene loci as described in \n \nPCT Patent Application WO98/24893, Kucherlapati and Jakobovits et al., published December 3, 1997\n \n (see also, \nJakobovits, 1998, Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs 7(4): 607-614\n; \n \nU.S. patents 6,162,963 issued 19 December 2000\n \n; \n \n6,150,584 issued 12 November 2000\n \n; and, \n \n6,114598 issued 5 September 2000\n \n). This method avoids the \nin vitro\n manipulation required with phage display technology and efficiently produces high affinity authentic human antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReactivity of PSCA antibodies with a PSCA-related protein can be established by a number of well known means, including Western blot, immunoprecipitation, ELISA, and FACS analyses using, as appropriate, PSCA-related proteins, PSCA-expressing cells or extracts thereof. A PSCA antibody or fragment thereof can be labeled with a detectable marker or conjugated to a second molecule. Suitable detectable markers include, but are not limited to, a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, a bioluminescent compound, chemiluminescent compound, a metal chelator or an enzyme. Further, bi-specific antibodies specific for two or more PSCA epitopes are generated using methods generally known in the art. Homodimeric antibodies can also be generated by cross-linking techniques known in the art (\ne.g.\n, \nWolff et al., Cancer Res. 53: 2560-2565\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides for monoclonal antibodies identified as Ha1-1.16, Ha1-5.99, Ha1-4.117, Ha1-4.20, Ha1-4.121, Ha1-4.37 were sent (via Federal Express) to the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), P.O. Box 1549, Manassas, VA 20108 on 04-May-2005 and assigned Accession numbers PTA-6698 and PTA-6703 and PTA-6699 and PTA-6700 and PTA-6701 and PTA-6702 respectively.\n\n\n \nV.) PSCA Cellular Immune Responses\n\n\n \n \n \nThe mechanism by which T cells recognize antigens has been delineated. Efficacious peptide epitope vaccine compositions of the invention induce a therapeutic or prophylactic immune responses in very broad segments of the world-wide population. For an understanding of the value and efficacy of compositions of the invention that induce cellular immune responses, a brief review of immunology-related technology is provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA complex of an HLA molecule and a peptidic antigen acts as the ligand recognized by HLA-restricted T cells (\nBuus, S. et al., Cell 47:1071, 1986\n; \nBabbitt, B. P. et al., Nature 317:359, 1985\n; \nTownsend, A. and Bodmer, H., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 7:601, 1989\n; \nGermain, R. N., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 11:403, 1993\n). Through the study of single amino acid substituted antigen analogs and the sequencing of endogenously bound, naturally processed peptides, critical residues that correspond to motifs required for specific binding to HLA antigen molecules have been identified and are set forth in Table IV (see also, \ne.g.\n, \nSouthwood, et al., J. Immunol. 160:3363, 1998\n; \nRammensee, et al., Immunogenetics 41:178, 1995\n; \nRammensee et al., SYFPEITHI, access via World Wide Web at URL (134.2.96.221/scripts.hlaserver.dll/home.htm\n); \nSette, A. and Sidney, J.

Immunogenetics 1999 Nov; 50(3-4):201-12\n, Review).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, x-ray crystallographic analyses of HLA-peptide complexes have revealed pockets within the peptide binding cleft/groove of HLA molecules which accommodate, in an allele-specific mode, residues borne by peptide ligands; these residues in turn determine the HLA binding capacity of the peptides in which they are present. (See, \ne.g.\n, \nMadden, D.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 13:587, 1995\n; \nSmith, et al., Immunity 4:203, 1996\n; \nFremont et al., Immunity 8:305, 1998\n; \nStem et al., Structure 2:245, 1994\n; \nJones, E.Y. Curr, Opin. Immunol. 9:75, 1997\n; \nBrown, J. H. et al., Nature 364:33, 1993\n;\n Guo, H. C. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:8053, 1993\n; \nGuo, H. C. et al., Nature 360:364,1992\n; \nSilver, M. L. et al., Nature 360:367, 1992\n; \nMatsumura, M. et al., Science 257:927, 1992\n; \nMadden et al., Cell 70:1035, 1992\n; \nFremont, D. H. et al., Science 257:919, 1992\n; \nSaper, M. A., Bjorkman, P. J. and Wiley, D. C., J. Mol. Biol. 219:277, 1991\n.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the definition of class I and class II allele-specific HLA binding motifs, or class I or class II supermotifs allows identification of regions within a protein that are correlated with binding to particular HLA antigen(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, by a process of HLA motif identification, candidates for epitope-based vaccines have been identified; such candidates can be further evaluated by HLA-peptide binding assays to determine binding affinity and/or the time period of association of the epitope and its corresponding HLA molecule. Additional confirmatory work can be performed to select, amongst these vaccine candidates, epitopes with preferred characteristics in terms of population coverage, and/or immunogenicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious strategies can be utilized to evaluate cellular immunogenicity, including:\n\n \n \n \n1) Evaluation of primary T cell cultures from normal individuals (see, \ne.g.\n, \nWentworth, P. A. et al., Mol. Immunol. 32:603, 1995\n; \nCelis, E. et al., Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:2105, 1994\n; \nTsai, V. et al., J. Immunol. 158:1796, 1997\n; \nKawashima, I. et al., Human Immunol. 59:1, 1998\n). This procedure involves the stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from normal subjects with a test peptide in the presence of antigen presenting cells \nin vitro\n over a period of several weeks. T cells specific for the peptide become activated during this time and are detected using, \ne.g.\n, a lymphokine- or 51Cr-release assay involving peptide sensitized target cells.\n \n2) Immunization of HLA transgenic mice (see, \ne.g.\n, \nWentworth, P. A. et al., J. Immunol. 26:97, 1996\n; \nWentworth, P. A. et al., Int. Immunol. 8:651, 1996\n; \nAlexander, J. et al., J. Immunol. 159:4753, 1997\n). For example, in such methods peptides in incomplete Freund's adjuvant are administered subcutaneously to HLA transgenic mice. Several weeks following immunization, splenocytes are removed and cultured \nin vitro\n in the presence of test peptide for approximately one week. Peptide-specific T cells are detected using, \ne.g.\n, a 51Cr-release assay involving peptide sensitized target cells and target cells expressing endogenously generated antigen.\n \n3) Demonstration of recall T cell responses from immune individuals who have been either effectively vaccinated and/or from chronically ill patients (see, \ne.g.\n, \nRehermann, B. et al., J. Exp. Med. 181:1047, 1995\n; \nDoolan, D. L. et al., Immunity 7:97, 1997\n; \nBertoni, R. et al., J. Clin. Invest. 100:503, 1997\n; \nThrelkeld, S. C. et al., J. Immunol. 159:1648, 1997\n; \nDiepolder, H. M. et al., J. Virol. 71:6011, 1997\n). Accordingly, recall responses are detected by culturing PBL from subjects that have been exposed to the antigen due to disease and thus have generated an immune response \"naturally\", or from patients who were vaccinated against the antigen. PBL from subjects are cultured \nin vitro\n for 1-2 weeks in the presence of test peptide plus antigen presenting cells (APC) to allow activation of \"memory\" T cells, as compared to \"naive\" T cells. At the end of the culture period, T cell activity is detected using assays including 51 Cr release involving peptide-sensitized targets, T cell proliferation, or lymphokine release.\n \n\n\nVI.) PSCA Transgenic Animals\n\n\n \n \n \nNucleic acids that encode a PSCA-related protein can also be used to generate either transgenic animals or \"knock out\" animals that, in turn, are useful in the development and screening of therapeutically useful reagents. In accordance with established techniques, cDNA encoding PSCA can be used to clone genomic DNA that encodes PSCA. The cloned genomic sequences can then be used to generate transgenic animals containing cells that express DNA that encode PSCA. Methods for generating transgenic animals, particularly animals such as mice or rats, have become conventional in the art and are described, for example, in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 4,736,866 issued 12 April 1988\n \n, and \n \n4,870,009 issued 26 September 1989\n \n. Typically, particular cells would be targeted for PSCA transgene incorporation with tissue-specific enhancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransgenic animals that include a copy of a transgene encoding PSCA can be used to examine the effect of increased expression of DNA that encodes PSCA. Such animals can be used as tester animals for reagents thought to confer protection from, for example, pathological conditions associated with its overexpression. In accordance with this aspect of the invention, an animal is treated with a reagent and a reduced incidence of a pathological condition, compared to untreated animals that bear the transgene, would indicate a potential therapeutic intervention for the pathological condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, non-human homologues of PSCA can be used to construct a PSCA \"knock out\" animal that has a defective or altered gene encoding PSCA as a result of homologous recombination between the endogenous gene encoding PSCA and altered genomic DNA encoding PSCA introduced into an embryonic cell of the animal. For example, cDNA that encodes PSCA can be used to clone genomic DNA encoding PSCA in accordance with established techniques. A portion of the genomic DNA encoding PSCA can be deleted or replaced with another gene, such as a gene encoding a selectable marker that can be used to monitor integration. Typically, several kilobases of unaltered flanking DNA (both at the 5' and 3' ends) are included in the vector (see, \ne.g.\n, \nThomas and Capecchi, Cell, 51:503 (1987\n) for a description of homologous recombination vectors). The vector is introduced into an embryonic stem cell line (\ne.g.\n, by electroporation) and cells in which the introduced DNA has homologously recombined with the endogenous DNA are selected (see, \ne.g.\n, \nLi et al., Cell, 69:915 (1992\n)). The selected cells are then injected into a blastocyst of an animal (\ne.g.\n, a mouse or rat) to form aggregation chimeras (see, \ne.g.\n, \nBradley, in Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach, E. J. Robertson, ed, (IRL, Oxford, 1987), pp. 113-152\n). A chimeric embryo can then be implanted into a suitable pseudopregnant female foster animal, and the embryo brought to term to create a \"knock out\" animal. Progeny harboring the homologously recombined DNA in their germ cells can be identified by standard techniques and used to breed animals in which all cells of the animal contain the homologously recombined DNA. Knock out animals can be characterized, for example, for their ability to defend against certain pathological conditions or for their development of pathological conditions due to absence of a PSCA polypeptide.\n\n\n \nVII.) Methods for the Detection of PSCA\n\n\n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention relates to methods for detecting PSCA polynucleotides and PSCA-related proteins, as well as methods for identifying a cell that expresses PSCA. The expression profile of PSCA makes it a diagnostic marker for metastasized disease. Accordingly, the status of PSCA gene products provides information useful for predicting a variety of factors including susceptibility to advanced stage disease, rate of progression, and/or tumor aggressiveness. As discussed in detail herein, the status of PSCA gene products in patient samples can be analyzed by a variety protocols that are well known in the art including immunohistochemical analysis, the variety of Northern blotting techniques including in situ hybridization, RT-PCR analysis (for example on laser capture micro-dissected samples), Western blot analysis and tissue array analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, the invention provides assays for the detection of PSCA polynucleotides in a biological sample, such as serum, bone, prostate, and other tissues, urine, semen, cell preparations, and the like. Detectable PSCA polynucleotides include, for example, a PSCA gene or fragment thereof, PSCA mRNA, alternative splice variant PSCA mRNAs, and recombinant DNA or RNA molecules that contain a PSCA polynucleotide. A number of methods for amplifying and/or detecting the presence of PSCA polynucleotides are well known in the art and can be employed in the practice of this aspect of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a method for detecting a PSCA mRNA in a biological sample comprises producing cDNA from the sample by reverse transcription using at least one primer; amplifying the cDNA so produced using a PSCA polynucleotides as sense and antisense primers to amplify PSCA cDNAs therein; and detecting the presence of the amplified PSCA cDNA. Optionally, the sequence of the amplified PSCA cDNA can be determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a method of detecting a PSCA gene in a biological sample comprises first isolating genomic DNA from the sample; amplifying the isolated genomic DNA using PSCA polynucleotides as sense and antisense primers; and detecting the presence of the amplified PSCA gene. Any number of appropriate sense and antisense probe combinations can be designed from a PSCA nucleotide sequence (see, \ne.g.\n, \nFigure 1\n) and used for this purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides assays for detecting the presence of a PSCA protein in a tissue or other biological sample such as serum, semen, bone, prostate, urine, cell preparations, and the like. Methods for detecting a PSCA-related protein are also well known and include, for example, immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemical analysis, Western blot analysis, molecular binding assays, ELISA, ELIFA and the like. For example, a method of detecting the presence of a PSCA-related protein in a biological sample comprises first contacting the sample with a PSCA antibody, a PSCA-reactive fragment thereof, or a recombinant protein containing an antigen-binding region of a PSCA antibody; and then detecting the binding of PSCA-related protein in the sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for identifying a cell that expresses PSCA are also within the scope of the invention. In one embodiment, an assay for identifying a cell that expresses a PSCA gene comprises detecting the presence of PSCA mRNA in the cell. Methods for the detection of particular mRNAs in cells are well known and include, for example, hybridization assays using complementary DNA probes (such as in situ hybridization using labeled PSCA riboprobes, Northern blot and related techniques) and various nucleic acid amplification assays (such as RT-PCR using complementary primers specific for PSCA, and other amplification type detection methods, such as, for example, branched DNA, SISBA, TMA and the like). Alternatively, an assay for identifying a cell that expresses a PSCA gene comprises detecting the presence of PSCA-related protein in the cell or secreted by the cell. Various methods for the detection of proteins are well known in the art and are employed for the detection of PSCA-related proteins and cells that express PSCA-related proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPSCA expression analysis is also useful as a tool for identifying and evaluating agents that modulate PSCA gene expression. For example, PSCA expression is significantly upregulated in prostate cancer, and is expressed in cancers of the tissues listed in Table I. Identification of a molecule or biological agent that inhibits PSCA expression or over-expression in cancer cells is of therapeutic value. For example, such an agent can be identified by using a screen that quantifies PSCA expression by RT-PCR, nucleic acid hybridization or antibody binding.\n\n\n \nVIII.) Methods for Monitoring the Status of PSCA-related Genes and Their Products\n\n\n \n \n \nOncogenesis is known to be a multistep process where cellular growth becomes progressively dysregulated and cells progress from a normal physiological state to precancerous and then cancerous states (see, \ne.g.\n, \nAlers et al., Lab Invest, 77(5): 437-438 (1997\n) and \nIsaacs et al., Cancer Surv. 23: 19-32 (1995\n)). In this context, examining a biological sample for evidence of dysregulated cell growth (such as aberrant PSCA expression in cancers) allows for early detection of such aberrant physiology, before a pathologic state such as cancer has progressed to a stage that therapeutic options are more limited and or the prognosis is worse. In such examinations, the status af PSCA in a biological sample of interest can be compared, for example, to the status of PSCA in a corresponding normal sample (\ne.g.\n a sample from that individual or alternatively another individual that is not affected by a pathology). An alteration in the status af PSCA in the biological sample (as compared to the normal sample) provides evidence of dysregulated cellular growth. In addition to using a biological sample that is not affected by a pathology as a normal sample, one can also use a predetermined normative value such as a predetermined normal level of mRNA expression (see, \ne.g.\n, \nGrever et al., J. Comp. Neurol. 1996 \n and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,837,501\n \n) to compare PSCA status in a sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"status\" in this context is used according to its art accepted meaning and refers to the condition or state of a gene and its products. Typically, skilled artisans use a number of parameters to evaluate the condition or state of a gene and its products. These include, but are not limited to the location of expressed gene products (including the location of PSCA expressing cells) as well as the level, and biological activity of expressed gene products (such as PSCA mRNA, polynucleotides and polypeptides). Typically, an alteration in the status of PSCA comprises a change in the location of PSCA and/or PSCA expressing cells and/or an increase in PSCA mRNA and/or protein expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPSCA status in a sample can be analyzed by a number of means well known in the art, including without limitation, immunohistochemical analysis, in situ hybridization, RT-PCR analysis on laser capture micro-dissected samples, Western blot analysis, and tissue array analysis. Typical protocols for evaluating the status of a PSCA gene and gene products are found, for example in \nAusubel et al. eds., 1995, Current Protocols In Molecular Biology, Units 2 (Northern Blotting), 4 (Southern Blotting), 15 (Immunoblotting) and 18 (PCR Analys\nis). Thus, the status of PSCA in a biological sample is evaluated by various methods utilized by skilled artisans including, but not limited to genomic Southern analysis (to examine, for example perturbations in a PSCA gene), Northern analysis and/or PCR analysis of PSCA mRNA (to examine, for example alterations in the polynucleotide sequences or expression levels of PSCA mRNAs), and, Western and/or immunohistochemical analysis (to examine, for example alterations in polypeptide sequences, alterations in polypeptide localization within a sample, alterations in expression levels of PSCA proteins and/or associations of PSCA proteins with polypeptide binding partners). Detectable PSCA polynucleotides include, for example, a PSCA gene or fragment thereof, PSCA mRNA, alternative splice variants, PSCA mRNAs, and recombinant DNA or RNA molecules containing a PSCA polynucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression profile of PSCA makes it a diagnostic marker for local and/or metastasized disease, and provides information on the growth or oncogenic potential of a biological sample. In particular, the status of PSCA provides information useful for predicting susceptibility to particular disease stages, progression, and/or tumor aggressiveness. The invention provides methods and assays for determining PSCA status and diagnosing cancers that express PSCA, such as cancers of the tissues listed in Table I. For example, because PSCA mRNA is so highly expressed in prostate and other cancers relative to normal prostate tissue, assays that evaluate the levels of PSCA RNA transcripts or proteins in a biological sample can be used to diagnose a disease associated with PSCA dysregulation, and can provide prognostic information useful in defining appropriate therapeutic options.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression status af PSCA provides information including the presence, stage and location of dysplastic, precancerous and cancerous cells, predicting susceptibility to various stages of disease, and/or for gauging tumor aggressiveness. Moreover, the expression profile makes it useful as an imaging reagent for metastasized disease. Consequently, an aspect of the invention is directed to the various molecular prognostic and diagnostic methods for examining the status of PSCA in biological samples such as those from individuals suffering from, or suspected of suffering from a pathology characterized by dysregulated cellular growth, such as cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, the status of PSCA in a biological sample can be examined by a number of well-known procedures in the art. For example, the status of PSCA in a biological sample taken from a specific location in the body can be examined by evaluating the sample for the presence or absence of PSCA expressing cells (\ne.g.\n those that express PSCA mRNAs or proteins). This examination can provide evidence of dysregulated cellular growth, for example, when PSCA-expressing cells are found in a biological sample that does not normally contain such cells (such as a lymph node), because such alterations in the status of PSCA in a biological sample are often associated with dysregulated cellular growth. Specifically, one indicator of dysregulated cellular growth is the metastases of cancer cells from an organ of origin (such as the prostate) to a different area of the body (such as a lymph node). In this context, evidence of dysregulated cellular growth is important for example because occult lymph node metastases can be detected in a substantial proportion of patients with prostate cancer, and such metastases are associated with known predictors of disease progression (see, \ne.g.\n, \nMurphy et al., Prostate 42(4): 315-317 (2000\n);\nSu et al., Semin. Surg. Oncol. 18(1): 17-28 (2000\n) and \nFreeman et al., J Urol 1995 Aug 154(2 Pt1):474-8\n),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides methods for monitoring PSCA gene products by determining the status of PSCA gene products expressed by cells from an individual suspected of having a disease associated with dysregulated cell growth (such as hyperplasia or cancer) and then comparing the status so determined to the status of PSCA gene products in a corresponding normal sample. The presence of aberrant PSCA gene products in the test sample relative to the normal sample provides an indication of the presence of dysregulated cell growth within the cells of the individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides assays useful in determining the presence of cancer in an individual, comprising detecting a significant increase in PSCA mRNA or protein expression in a test cell or tissue sample relative to expression levels in the corresponding normal cell or tissue. The presence of PSCA mRNA can, for example, be evaluated in tissues including but not limited to those listed in Table I. The presence of significant PSCA expression in any of these tissues is useful to indicate the emergence, presence and/or severity of cancer, since the corresponding normal tissues do not express PSCA mRNA or express it at lower levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a related embodiment, PSCA status is determined at the protein level rather than at the nucleic acid level. For example, such a method comprises determining the level of PSCA protein expressed by cells in a test tissue sample and comparing the level so determined to the level of PSCA expressed in a corresponding normal sample. In one embodiment, the presence of PSCA protein is evaluated, for example, using immunohistochemical methods. PSCA antibodies or binding partners capable of detecting PSCA protein expression are used in a variety of assay formats well known in the art for this purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, one can evaluate the status of PSCA nucleotide and amino acid sequences in a biological sample in order to identify.perturbations in the structure of these molecules. These perturbations can include insertions, deletions, substitutions and the like. Such evaluations are useful because perturbations in the nucleotide and amino acid sequences are observed in a large number of proteins associated with a growth dysregulated phenotype (see, \ne.g.\n, \nMarrogi et al., 1999, J. Cutan. Pathol. 26(8):369-378\n). For example, a mutation in the sequence of PSCA may be indicative of the presence or promotion of a tumor. Such assays therefore have diagnostic and predictive value where a mutation in PSCA indicates a potential loss of function or increase in tumor growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide variety of assays for observing perturbations in nucleotide and amino acid sequences are well known in the art. For example, the size and structure of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences of PSCA gene products are observed by the Northern, Southern, Western, PCR and DNA sequencing protocols discussed herein. In addition, other methods for observing perturbations in nucleotide and amino acid sequences such as single strand conformation polymorphism analysis are well known in the art (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,382,510 issued 7 September 1999\n \n, and \n \n5,952,170 issued 17 January 1995\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, one can examine the methylation status of a PSCA gene in a biological sample. Aberrant demethylation and/or hypermethylation of CpG islands in gene 5' regulatory regions frequently occurs in immortalized and transformed cells, and can result in altered expression of various genes. For example, promoter hypermethylation of the pi-class glutathione S-transferase (a protein expressed in normal prostate but not expressed in >90% of prostate carcinomas) appears to permanently silence transcription of this gene and is the most frequently detected genomic alteration in prostate carcinomas (\nDe Marzo et al., Am. J. Pathol. 155(6): 1985-1992 (1999\n)), In addition, this alteration is present in at least 70% of cases of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) (\nBrooks et al., Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev., 1998, 7:531-536\n). In another example, expression of the LAGE-I tumor specific gene (which is not expressed in normal prostate but is expressed in 25-50% of prostate cancers) is induced by deoxy-azacytidine in lymphoblastoid cells, suggesting that tumoral expression is due to demethylation (\nLethe et al., Int. J. Cancer 76(6): 903-908 (1998\n)). A variety of assays for examining methylation status of a gene are well known in the art. For example, one can utilize, in Southern hybridization approaches, methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes that cannot cleave sequences that contain methylated CpG sites to assess the methylation status of CpG islands. In addition, MSP (methylation specific PCR) can rapidly profile the methylation status of all the CpG sites present in a CpG island of a given gene. This procedure involves initial modification of DNA by sodium bisulfite (which will convert all unmethylated cytosines to uracil) followed by amplification using primers specific for methylated versus unmethylated DNA. Protocols involving methylation interference can also be found for example in \nCurrent Protocols In Molecular Biology, \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene amplification is an additional method for assessing the status of PSCA. Gene amplification is measured in a sample directly, for example, by conventional Southern blotting or Northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA (\nThomas, 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77:5201 5205\n), dot blotting (DNA analysis), or in situ hybridization, using an appropriately labeled probe, based on the sequences provided herein. Alternatively, antibodies are employed that recognize specific duplexes, including DNA duplexes, RNA duplexes, and DNA RNA hybrid duplexes or DNA protein duplexes. The antibodies in turn are labeled and the assay carried out where the duplex is bound to a surface, so that upon the formation of duplex on the surface, the presence of antibody bound to the duplex can be detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiopsied tissue or peripheral blood can be conveniently assayed for the presence of cancer cells using for example, Northern, dot blot or RT-PCR analysis to detect PSCA expression. The presence of RT-PCR amplifiable PSCA mRNA provides an indication of the presence of cancer. RT-PCR assays are well known in the art. RT-PCR detection assays for tumor cells in peripheral blood are currently being evaluated for use in the diagnosis and management of a number of human solid tumors. In the prostate cancer field, these include RT-PCR assays for the detection of cells expressing PSA and PSM (\nVerkaik et al., 1997, Urol. Res. 25:373-384\n; \nGhossein et al., 1995, J. Clin. Oncol. 13:1195-2000\n; \nHeston et al., 1995, Clin. Chem. 41:1687-1688\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the invention is an assessment of the susceptibility that an individual has for developing cancer. In one embodiment, a method for predicting susceptibility to cancer comprises detecting PSCA mRNA or PSCA protein in a tissue sample, its presence indicating susceptibility to cancer, wherein the degree of PSCA mRNA expression correlates to the degree of susceptibility. In a specific embodiment, the presence of PSCA in prostate or other tissue is examined, with the presence of PSCA in the sample providing an indication of prostate cancer susceptibility (or the emergence or existence of a prostate tumor). Similarly, one can evaluate the integrity PSCA nucleotide and amino acid sequences in a biological sample, in order to identify perturbations in the structure of these molecules such as insertions, deletions, substitutions and the like. The presence of one or more perturbations in PSCA gene products in the sample is an indication of cancer susceptibility (or the emergence or existence of a tumor).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also comprises methods for gauging tumor aggressiveness. In one embodiment, a method for gauging aggressiveness of a tumor comprises determining the level of PSCA mRNA or PSCA protein expressed by tumor cells, comparing the level so determined to the level of PSCA mRNA or PSCA protein expressed in a corresponding normal tissue taken from the same individual or a normal tissue reference sample, wherein the degree of PSCA mRNA or PSCA protein expression in the tumor sample relative to the normal sample indicates the degree of aggressiveness. In a specific embodiment, aggressiveness of a tumor is evaluated by determining the extent to which PSCA is expressed in the tumor cells, with higher expression levels indicating more aggressive tumors. Another embodiment is the evaluation of the integrity of PSCA nucleotide and amino acid sequences in a biological sample, in order to identify perturbations in the structure of these molecules such as insertions, deletions, substitutions and the like. The presence of one or more perturbations indicates more aggressive tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the invention is directed to methods for observing the progression of a malignancy in an individual over time. In one embodiment, methods for observing the progression of a malignancy in an individual over time comprise determining the level of PSCA mRNA or PSCA protein expressed by cells in a sample of the tumor, comparing the level so determined to the level of PSCA mRNA or PSCA protein expressed in an equivalent tissue sample taken from the same individual at a different time, wherein the degree of PSCA mRNA or PSCA protein expression in the tumor sample over time provides information on the progression of the cancer. In a specific embodiment, the progression of a cancer is evaluated by determining PSCA expression in the tumor cells over time, where increased expression over time indicates a progression of the cancer. Also, one can evaluate the integrity PSCA nucleotide and amino acid sequences in a biological sample in order to identify perturbations in the structure of these molecules such as insertions, deletions, substitutions and the like, where the presence of one or more perturbations indicates a progression of the cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above diagnostic approaches can be combined with any one of a wide variety of prognostic and diagnostic protocols known in the art. For example, another embodiment of the invention is directed to methods for observing a coincidence between the expression of PSCA gene and PSCA gene products (or perturbations in PSCA gene and PSCA gene products) and a factor that is associated with malignancy, as a means for diagnosing and prognosticating the status of a tissue sample. A wide variety of factors associated with malignancy can be utilized, such as the expression of genes associated with malignancy (\ne.g.\n PSA, PSCA and PSM expression for prostate cancer etc.) as well as gross cytological observations (see, \ne.g.\n, \nBooking et al., 1984, Anal. Quant. Cytol. 6(2):74-88\n; \nEpstein, 1995, Hum. Pathol. 26(2):223-9\n; \nThorson et al., 1998, Mod. Pathol. 11(6):543-51\n; \nBaisden et al., 1999, Am. J. Surg. Pathol. 23(8):918-24\n). Methods for observing a coincidence between the expression of PSCA gene and PSCA gene products (or perturbations in PSCA gene and PSCA gene products) and another factor that is associated with malignancy are useful, for example, because the presence of a set of specific factors that coincide with disease provides information crucial for diagnosing and prognosticating the status of a tissue sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, methods for observing a coincidence between the expression of PSCA gene and PSCA gene products (or perturbations in PSCA gene and PSCA gene products) and another factor associated with malignancy entails detecting the overexpression of PSCA mRNA or protein in a tissue sample, detecting the overexpression of PSA mRNA or protein in a tissue sample (or PSCA or PSM expression), and observing a coincidence of PSCA RNA or protein and PSA mRNA or protein overexpression (or PSCA or PSM expression). In a specific embodiment, the expression of PSCA and PSA mRNA in prostate tissue is examined, where the coincidence of PSCA and PSA mRNA overexpression in the sample indicates the existence of prostate cancer, prostate cancer susceptibility or the emergence or status of a prostate tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for detecting and quantifying the expression of PSCA mRNA or protein are described herein, and standard nucleic acid and protein detection and quantification technologies are well known in the art. Standard methods for the detection and quantification of PSCA mRNA include in situ hybridization using labeled PSCA riboprobes, Northern blot and related techniques using PSCA polynucleotide probes, RT-PCR analysis using primers specific for PSCA, and other amplification type detection methods, such as, for example, branched DNA, STSBA, TMA and the like. In a specific embodiment, semi-quantitative RT-PCR is used to detect and quantify PSCA mRNA expression. Any number of primers capable of amplifying PSCA can be used for this purpose, including but not limited to the various primer sets specifically described herein. In a specific embodiment, polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specifically reactive with the wild-type PSCA protein can be used in an immunohistochemical assay of biopsied tissue.\n\n\n \nIX.) Identification of Molecules That Interact With PSCA\n\n\n \n \n \nThe PSCA protein and nucleic acid sequences disclosed herein allow a skilled artisan to identify proteins, small molecules and other agents that interact with PSCA, as well as pathways activated by PSCA via any one of a variety of art accepted protocols. For example, one can utilize one of the so-called interaction trap systems (also referred to as the \"two-hybrid assay\"). In such systems, molecules interact and reconstitute a transcription factor which directs expression of a reporter gene, whereupon the expression of the reporter gene is assayed. Other systems identify protein-protein interactions \nin vivo\n through reconstitution of a eukaryotic transcriptional activator, see, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,955,280 issued 21 September 1999\n \n, \n \n5,925,523 issued 20 July 1999\n \n, \n \n5,846,722 issued 8 December 1998\n \n and \n \n6,004,746 issued 21 December 1999\n \n. Algorithms are also available in the art for genome-based predictions of protein function (see, \ne.g.\n, \nMarcotte, et al., Nature 402: 4 November 1999, 83-86\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively one can screen peptide libraries to identify molecules that interact with PSCA protein sequences. In such methods, peptides that bind to PSCA are identified by screening libraries that encode a random or controlled collection of amino acids. Peptides encoded by the libraries are expressed as fusion proteins of bacteriophage coat proteins, the bacteriophage particles are then screened against the PSCA protein(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, peptides having a wide variety of uses, such as therapeutic, prognostic or diagnostic reagents, are thus identified without any prior information on the structure of the expected ligand or receptor molecule. Typical peptide libraries and screening methods that can be used to identify molecules that interact with PSCA protein sequences are disclosed for example in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,723,286 issued 3 March 1998\n \n and \n \n5,733,731 issued 31 March 1998\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, cell lines that express PSCA are used to identify protein-protein interactions mediated by PSCA. Such interactions can be examined using immunoprecipitation techniques (see, \ne.g.\n, \nHamilton B.J., et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999, 261:646-51\n). PSCA protein can be immunoprecipitated from PSCA-expressing cell lines using anti-PSCA antibodies. Alternatively, antibodies against His-tag can be used in a cell line engineered to express fusions of PSCA and a His-tag (vectors mentioned above). The immunoprecipitated complex can be examined for protein association by procedures such as Western blotting, \n35\nS-methionine labeling of proteins, protein micro sequencing, silver staining and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSmall molecules and ligands that interact with PSCA can be identified through related embodiments of such screening assays. For example, small molecules can be identified that interfere with protein function, including molecules that interfere with PSCA's ability to mediate phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation, interaction with DNA or RNA molecules as an indication of regulation of cell cycles, second messenger signaling or tumorigenesis. Similarly, small molecules that modulate PSCA-related ion channel, protein pump, or cell communication functions are identified and used to treat patients that have a cancer that expresses PSCA (see, \ne.g.\n, \nHille, B., Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes 2nd Ed., Sinauer Assoc., Sunderland, MA, 1992\n). Moreover, ligands that regulate PSCA function can be identified based on their ability to bind PSCA and activate a reporter construct. Typical methods are discussed for example in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,928,868 issued 27 July 1999\n \n, and include methods for forming hybrid ligands in which at least one ligand is a small molecule. In an illustrative embodiment, cells engineered to express a fusion protein of PSCA and a DNA-binding protein are used to co-express a fusion protein of a hybrid ligand/small molecule and a cDNA library transcriptional activator protein. The cells further contain a reporter gene, the expression of which is conditioned on the proximity of the first and second fusion proteins to each other, an event that occurs only if the hybrid ligand binds to target sites on both hybrid proteins. Those cells that express the reporter gene are selected and the unknown small molecule or the unknown ligand is identified. This method provides a means of identifying modulators, which activate or inhibit PSCA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn embodiment of this invention comprises a method of screening for a molecule that interacts with a PSCA amino acid sequence shown in \nFigure 1\n, comprising the steps of contacting a population of molecules with a PSCA amino acid sequence, allowing the population of molecules and the PSCA amino acid sequence to interact under conditions that facilitate an interaction, determining the presence of a molecule that interacts with the PSCA amino acid sequence, and then separating molecules that do not interact with the PSCA amino acid sequence from molecules that do. In a specific embodiment, the method further comprises purifying, characterizing and identifying a molecule that interacts with the PSCA amino acid sequence. The identified molecule can be used to modulate a function performed by PSCA. In a preferred embodiment, the PSCA amino acid sequence is contacted with a library of peptides.\n\n\n \nX.) Therapeutic Methods and Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe identification of PSCA as a protein that is normally expressed in a restricted set of tissues, but which is also expressed in cancers such as those listed in Table I, opens a number of therapeutic approaches to the treatment of such cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf note, targeted antitumor therapies have been useful even when the targeted protein is expressed on normal tissues, even vital normal organ tissues. A vital organ is one that is necessary to sustain life, such as the heart or colon. A non-vital organ is one that can be removed whereupon the individual is still able to survive. Examples of non-vital organs are ovary, breast, and prostate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, Herceptin® is an FDA approved pharmaceutical that consists of an antibody which is immunoreactive with the protein variously known as HER2, HER2/neu, and erb-b-2. It is marketed by Genentech and has been a commercially successful antitumor agent. Herceptin® sales reached almost $400 million in 2002. Herceptin® is a treatment for HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. However, the expression af HER2 is not limited to such tumors. The same protein is expressed in a number of normal tissues. In particular, it is known that HER2/neu is present in normal kidney and heart, thus these tissues are present in all human recipients of Herceptin. The presence of HER2/neu in normal kidney is also confirmed by \nLatif, Z., et al., B.J.U. International (2002) 89:5-9\n. As shown in this article (which evaluated whether renal cell carcinoma should be a preferred indication for anti-HER2 antibodies such as Herceptin) both protein and mRNA are produced in benign renal tissues. Notably, HER2/neu protein was strongly overexpressed in benign renal tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite the fact that HER2/neu is expressed in such vital tissues as heart and kidney, Herceptin is a very useful, FDA approved, and commercially successful drug. The effect of Herceptin on cardiac tissue, \ni.e.\n, \"cardiotoxicity,\" has merely been a side effect to treatment. When patients were treated with Herceptin alone, significant cardiotoxicity occurred in a very low percentage of patients. To minimize cariotoxicity there is a more stringent entry requirement for the treatment with HER2/neu. Factors such as predisposition to heart condition are evaluated before treatment can occur.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf particular note, although kidney tissue is indicated to exhibit normal expression, possibly even higher expression than cardiac tissue, kidney has no appreciable Herceptin side effect whatsoever. Moreover, of the diverse array of normal tissues in which HER2 is expressed, there is very little occurrence of any side effect Only cardiac tissue has manifested any appreciable side effect at all. A tissue such as kidney, where HER2/neu expression is especially notable, has not been the basis for any side effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, favorable therapeutic effects have been found for antitumor therapies that target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); Erbitux (ImClone). EGFR is also expressed in numerous normal tissues. There have been very limited side effects in normal tissues following use of anti-EGFR therapeutics. A general side effect that occurs with the EGFR treatment is a severe skin rash observed in 100% of the patients undergoing treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, expression of a target protein in normal tissue, even vital normal tissue, does not defeat the utility of a targeting agent for the protein as a therapeutic for certain tumors in which the protein is also overexpressed. For example, expression in vital organs is not in and of itself detrimental. In addition, organs regarded as dispensible, such as the prostate and ovary, can be removed without affecting mortality. Finally, some vital organs are not affected by normal organ expression because of an immunoprivilege. Immunoprivileged organs are organs that are protected from blood by a blood-organ barrier and thus are not accessible to immunotherapy. Examples of immunoprivileged organs are the brain and testis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, therapeutic approaches that inhibit the activity of a PSCA protein are useful for patients suffering from a cancer that expresses PSCA. These therapeutic approaches generally fall into three classes. The first class modulates PSCA function as it relates to tumor cell growth leading to inhibition or retardation of tumor cell growth or inducing its killing. The second class comprises various methods for inhibiting the binding or association of a PSCA protein with its binding partner or with other proteins. The third class comprises a variety of methods for inhibiting the transcription of a PSCA gene or translation of PSCA mRNA.\n\n\n \nX.A.) Anti-Cancer Vaccines\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides cancer vaccines comprising a PSCA-related protein or PSCA-related nucleic acid. In view of the expression of PSCA, cancer vaccines prevent and/or treat PSCA-expressing cancers with minimal or no effects on non-target tissues. The use of a tumor antigen in a vaccine that generates cell-mediated humoral immune responses as anti-cancer therapy is well known in the art and has been employed in prostate cancer using human PSMA and rodent PAP immunogens (\nHodge et al., 1995, Int. J. Cancer 63:231-237\n; \nFong et al., 1997, J. Immunol. 159:3113-3117\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch methods can be readily practiced by employing a PSCA-related protein, or a PSCA-encoding nucleic acid molecule and recombinant vectors capable of expressing and presenting the PSCA immunogen (which typically comprises a number of T-cell epitopes or antibody). Skilled artisans understand that a wide variety of vaccine systems for delivery of immunoreactive epitopes are known in the art (see, \ne.g.\n, \nHeryln et al., Ann Med 1999 Feb 31(1):66-78\n; \nMaruyama et al., \n) Briefly, such methods of generating an immune response (\ne.g.\n cell-mediated and/or humoral) in a mammal, comprise the steps of: exposing the mammal's immune system to an immunoreactive epitope (\ne.g.\n an epitope present in a PSCA protein shown in \nFigure 1\n or analog or homolog thereof) so that the mammal generates an immune response that is specific for that epitope (\ne.g.\n generates antibodies that specifically recognize that epitope).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe entire PSCA protein, immunogenic regions or epitopes thereof can be combined and delivered by various means. Such vaccine compositions can include, for example, lipopeptides (\ne.g.\n, \nVitiello, A. et al., J. Clin. Invest. 95:341,1995\n), peptide compositions encapsulated in poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (\"PLG\") microspheres (see, \ne.g.\n, \nEldridge, et al., Molec. Immunol. 28:287-294, 1991\n: \nAlonso et al., Vaccine 12:299-306, 1994\n; \nJones et al., Vaccine 13:675-681, 1995\n), peptide compositions contained in immune stimulating complexes (ISCOMS) (see, \ne.g.\n, \nTakahashi et al., Nature 344:873-875, 1990\n; \nHu et al., Clin Exp Immunol.. 113:235-243, 1998\n), multiple antigen peptide systems (MAPs) (see \ne.g.\n, \nTam, J. P., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:5409-5413, 1988\n; \nTam, J.P., J. Immunol. Methods 196:17-32, 1996\n), peptides formulated as multivalent peptides; peptides for use in ballistic delivery systems, typically crystallized peptides, viral delivery vectors (\nPerkus, M. E. et al., In: Concepts in vaccine development, Kaufmann, S. H. E., ed., p. 379, 1996\n; \nChakrabarti, S. et al., Nature 320:535, 1986\n; \nHu, S. L. et al., Nature 320:537,1986\n; \nKieny, M.-P. et al., AIDS Bio/Technology 4:790, 1986\n; \nTop, F. H. et al., J. Infect. Dis. 124:148, 1971\n; \nChanda, P. K. et al., Virology 175:535, 1990\n), particles of viral or synthetic origin (\ne.g.\n, \nKofler, N. et al., J. Immunol. Methods. 192:25, 1996\n; \nEldridge, J. H. et al., Sem. Hematol. 30:16, 1993\n; \nFalo, L. D., Jr. et al., Nature Med. 7:649, 1995\n), adjuvants (\nWarren, H. S., Vogel, F. R., and Chedid, L. A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 4:369, 1986\n; \nGupta, R. K. et al., Vaccine 11:293, 1993\n), liposomes (\nReddy, R. et al., J. Immunol. 148:1585, 1992\n; \nRock, K. L., Immunol. Today 17:131, 1996\n), or, naked or particle absorbed cDNA (\nUlmer, J. B. et al., Science 259:1745, 1993\n; \nRobinson, H. L., Hunt, L. A., and Webster, R. G., Vaccine 11:957, 1993\n; \nShiver, J. W. et al., In: Concepts in vaccine development, Kaufmann, S. H. E., ed., p. 423, 1996\n; \nCease, K. B., and Berzofsky, J. A., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12:923, 1994\n and \nEldridge, J. H. et al., Sem. Hematol. 30:16,1993\n). Toxin-targeted delivery technologies, also known as receptor mediated targeting, such as those of Avant Immunotherapeutics, Inc. (Needham, Massachusetts) may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn patients with PSCA-associatcd cancer, the vaccine compositions of the invention can also be used in conjunction with other treatments used for cancer, \ne.g.\n, surgery, chemotherapy, drug therapies, radiation therapies, etc. including use in combination with immune adjuvants such as IL-2, IL-12, GM-CSF, and the like.\n\n\n \n\n\nCellular Vaccines:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCTL epitopes can be determined using specific algorithms to identify peptides within PSCA protein that bind corresponding HLA alleles (see \ne.g.\n, Table IV; Epimer™ and Epimatrix™, Brown University (URL brown.edu/Research/TB-HIV_Lab/epimatrix/epimatrix.html); and, BIMAS, (URL bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/; SYFPEITHI at URL syfpeithi.bmi-heidelberg.com/). In a preferred embodiment, a PSCA immunogen contains one or more amino acid sequences identified using techniques well known in the art, such as the sequences shown in Tables V-XVIII and XXTI-LI or a peptide of 8, 9, 10 or 11 amino acids specified by an HLA Class I motif/supermotif (\ne.g.\n, Table IV (A), Table IV (D), or Table IV (E)) and/or a peptide of at least 9 amino acids that comprises an HLA Class II motif/supermotif (\ne.g.\n, Table IV (B) or Table IV (C)). As is appreciated in the art, the HLA Class I binding groove is essentially closed ended so that peptides of only a particular size range can fit into the groove and be bound, generally HLA Class I epitopes are 8, 9, 10, or 11 amino acids long. In contrast, the HLA Class II binding groove is essentially open ended; therefore a peptide of about 9 or more amino acids can be bound by an HLA Class II molecule. Due to the binding groove differences between HLA Class I and II, HLA Class I motifs are length specific, \ni.e.\n, position two of a Class I motif is the second amino acid in an amino to carboxyl direction of the peptide. The amino acid positions in a Class II motif are relative only to each other, not the overall peptide, \ni.e.\n, additional amino acids can be attached to the amino and/or carboxyl termini of a motif-bearing sequence. HLA Class II epitopes are often 9, 10,11,12,13, 14,15,16,17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25 amino acids long, or longer than 25 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide variety of methods for generating an immune response in a mammal are known in the art (for example as the first step in the generation of hybridomas). Methods of generating an immune response in a mammal comprise exposing the mammal's immune system to an immunogenic epitope on a protein (\ne.g.\n a PSCA protein) so that an immune response is generated, A typical embodiment consists of a method for generating an immune response to PSCA in a host, by contacting the host with a sufficient amount of at least one PSCA B cell or cytotoxic T-cell epitope or analog thereof; and at least one periodic interval thereafter recontacting the host with the PSCA B cell or cytotoxic T-cell epitope or analog thereof. A specific embodiment consists of a method of generating an immune response against a PSCA-related protein or a man-made multiepitopic peptide comprising: administering PSCA immunogen (\ne.g.\n a PSCA protein or a peptide fragment thereof, a PSCA fusion protein or analog etc.) in a vaccine preparation to a human or another mammal. Typically, such vaccine preparations further contain a suitable adjuvant (see, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,145,535\n \n) or a universal helper epitope such as a PADRETM peptide (Epimmune Inc., San Diego, CA; see, \ne.g.\n, \nAlexander et al., J. Immunol. 2000 164(3); 164(3): 1625-1633\n; \nAlexander et al., Immunity 1994 1(9); 751-761\n and \nAlexander et al., Immunol. Res. 1998 18(2): 79-92\n). An alternative method comprises generating an immune response in an individual against a PSCA immunogen by: administering \nin vivo\n to muscle or skin of the individual's body a DNA molecule that comprises a DNA sequence that encodes a PSCA immunogen, the DNA sequence operatively linked to regulatory sequences which control the expression of the DNA sequence; wherein the DNA molecule is taken up by cells, the DNA sequence is expressed in the cells and an immune response is generated against the immunogen (see, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,962,428\n \n). Optionally a genetic vaccine facilitator such as anionic lipids; saponins; lectins; estrogenic compounds; hydroxylated lower alkyls; dimethyl sulfoxide; and urea is also administered. In addition, an antiidiotypic antibody can be administered that mimics PSCA, in order to generate a response to the target antigen.\n\n\n \n\n\nNucleic Acid Vaccines:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nVaccine compositions of the invention include nucleic acid-mediated modalities. DNA or RNA that encode protein(s) of the invention can be administered to a patient. Genetic immunization methods can be employed to generate prophylactic or therapeutic humoral and cellular immune responses directed against cancer cells expressing PSCA. Constructs comprising DNA encoding a PSCA-related protein/immunogen and appropriate regulatory sequences can be injected directly into muscle or skin of an individual, such that the cells of the muscle or skin take-up the construct and express the encoded PSCA protein/immunogen. Alternatively, a vaccine comprises a PSCA-related protein. Expression of the PSCA-related protein immunogen results in the generation of prophylactic or therapeutic humoral and cellular immunity against cells that bear a PSCA protein. Various-prophylactic and therapeutic genetic immunization techniques known in the art can be used (for review, see information and references published at Internet address genweb.com). Nucleic acid-based delivery is described, for instance, in \nWolff et. al., Science 247:1465 (1990\n) as well as \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,580,859\n \n; \n \n5,589,466\n \n; \n \n5,804,566\n \n; \n \n5,739,118\n \n; \n \n5,736,524\n \n; \n \n5,679,647\n \n; \n \nWO 98/04720\n \n. Examples of DNA-based delivery technologies include \"naked DNA\", facilitated (bupivicaine, polymers, peptide-mediated) delivery, cationic lipid complexes, and particle-mediated (\"gene gun\") or pressure-mediated delivery (see, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,922,687\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor therapeutic or prophylactic immunization purposes, proteins of the invention can be expressed via viral or bacterial vectors. Various viral gene delivery systems that can be used in the practice of the invention include, but are not limited to, vaccinia, fowlpox, canarypox, adenovirus, influenza, poliovirus, adeno-associated virus, lentivirus, and sindbis virus (see, \ne.g.\n, \nRestifo, 1996, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 8:658-663\n; \nTsang et al. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 87:982-990 (1995\n)). Non-viral delivery systems can also be employed by introducing naked DNA encoding a PSCA-related protein into the patient (\ne.g.\n, intramuscularly or intradermally) to induce an anti-tumor response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVaccinia virus is used, for example, as a vector to express nucleotide sequences that encode the peptides of the invention. Upon introduction into a host, the recombinant vaccinia virus expresses the protein immunogenic peptide, and thereby elicits a host immune response. Vaccinia vectors and methods useful in immunization protocols are described in, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,722,848\n \n. Another vector is BCG (Bacille Calmette Guerin). BCG vectors are described in \nStover et al., Nature 351:456-460 (1991\n). A wide variety of other vectors useful for therapeutic administration or immunization of the peptides of the invention, \ne.g.\n adeno and adeno-associated virus vectors, retroviral vectors, Salmonella typhi vectors, detoxified anthrax toxin vectors, and the like, will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, gene delivery systems are used to deliver a PSCA-related nucleic acid molecule. In one embodiment, the full-length human PSCA cDNA is employed. In another embodiment, PSCA nucleic acid molecules encoding specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and/or antibody epitopes are employed.\n\n\n \n\n\n \nEx Vivo\n Vaccines\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nVarious \nex vivo\n strategies can also be employed to generate an immune response. One approach involves the use of antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DC) to present PSCA antigen to a patient's immune system. Dendritic cells express MHC class I and II molecules, B7 co-stimulator, and IL-12, and are thus highly specialized antigen presenting cells. In prostate cancer, autologous dendritic cells pulsed with peptides of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) are being used in a Phase I clinical trial to stimulate prostate cancer patients' immune systems (\nTjoa et al., 1996, Prostate 28:65-69\n; \nMurphy et al., 1996, Prostate 29:371-380\n). Thus, dendritic cells can be used to present PSCA peptides to T cells in the context of MHC class I or II molecules. In one embodiment, autologous dendritic cells are pulsed with PSCA peptides capable of binding to MHC class I and/or class II molecules. In another embodiment, dendritic cells are pulsed with the complete PSCA protein. Yet another embodiment involves engineering the overexpression of a PSCA gene in dendritic cells using various implementing vectors known in the art, such as adenovirus (\nArthur et al., 1997, Cancer Gene Ther. 4:17-25\n), retrovirus (\nHenderson et al., 1996, Cancer Res. 56:3763-3770\n), lentivirus, adeno-associated virus, DNA transfection (\nRibas et al., 1997, Cancer Res. 57:2865-2869\n), or tumor-derived RNA transfection (\nAshley et al., 1997, J. Exp. Med. 185:1177-1182\n). Cells that express PSCA can also be engineered to express immune modulators, such as GM-CSF, and used as immunizing agents.\n\n\n \nX.B.) PSCA as a Target for Antibody-based Therapy\n\n\n \n \n \nPSCA is an attractive target for antibody-based therapeutic strategies. A number of antibody strategies are known in the art for targeting both extracellular and intracellular molecules (see, \ne.g.\n, complement and ADCC mediated killing as well as the use of intrabodies). Because PSCA is expressed by cancer cells of various lineages relative to corresponding normal cells, systemic administration of PSCA-immunoreactive compositions are prepared that exhibit excellent sensitivity without toxic, non-specific and/or non-target effects caused by binding of the immunoreactive composition to non-target organs and tissues. Antibodies specifically reactive with domains of PSCA are useful to treat PSCA-expressing cancers systemically, either as conjugates with a toxin or therapeutic agent, or as naked antibodies capable of inhibiting cell proliferation or function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPSCA antibodies can be introduced into a patient such that the antibody binds to PSCA and modulates a function, such as an interaction with a binding partner, and consequently mediates destruction of the tumor cells and/or inhibits the growth of the tumor cells. Mechanisms by which such antibodies exert a therapeutic effect can include complement-mediated cytolysis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, modulation of the physiological function of PSCA, inhibition of ligand binding or signal transduction pathways, modulation of tumor cell differentiation, alteration of tumor angiogenesis factor profiles, and/or apoptosis. Examples include Rituxan® for Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, Herceptin® for metastatic breast cancer, and Erbitux® for colorectal cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art understand that antibodies can be used to specifically target and bind immunogenic molecules such as an immunogenic region of a PSCA sequence shown in \nFigure 1\n. In addition, skilled artisans understand that it is routine to conjugate antibodies to cytotoxic agents (see, \ne.g.\n, \nSlevers et al. Blood 93:11 3678-3684 (June 1, 1999\n)). When cytotoxic and/or therapeutic agents are delivered directly to cells, such as by conjugating them to antibodies specific for a molecule expressed by that cell (\ne.g.\n PSCA), the cytotoxic agent will exert its known biological effect (\ni.e.\n cytotoxicity) on those cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide variety of compositions and methods for using antibody-cytotoxic agent conjugates to kill cells are known in the art. In the context of cancers, typical methods entail administering to an animal having a tumor a biologically effective amount of a conjugate comprising a selected cytotoxic and/or therapeutic agent linked to a targeting agent (\ne.g.\n an anti-PSCA antibody) that binds to a marker (\ne.g.\n PSCA) expressed, accessible to binding or localized on the cell surfaces. A typical embodiment is a method of delivering a cytotoxic and/or therapeutic agent to a cell expressing PSCA, comprising conjugating the cytotoxic agent to an antibody that immunospecifically binds to a PSCA epitope, and, exposing the cell to the antibody-agent conjugates. Another illustrative embodiment is a method of treating an individual suspected of suffering from metastasized cancer, comprising a step of administering parenterally to said individual a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic and/or therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancer immunotherapy using anti-PSCA antibodies can be done in accordance with various approaches that have been successfully employed in the treatment of other types of cancer, including but not limited to colon cancer (\nArlen et al., 1998, Crit. Rev. Immunol. 18:133-138\n), multiple myeloma (\nOzaki et al., 1997, Blood 90:3179-3186\n, \nTsunenari et al., 1997, Blood 90:2437-2444\n), gastric cancer (\nKasprzyk et al., 1992, Cancer Res. 52:2771-2776\n), B-cell lymphoma (\nFunakoshi et al., 1996, J. Immunother. Emphasis Tumor Immunol. 19:93-101\n), leukemia (\nZhong et al., 1996, Leuk. Res. 20:581-589\n), colorectal cancer (\nMoun et al., 1994, Cancer Res. 54:6160-6166\n; \nVelders et al., 1995, Cancer Res. 55:4398-4403\n), and breast cancer (\nShepard et al., 1991, J. Clin. Immunol. 11:117-127\n). Some therapeutic approaches involve conjugation of naked antibody to a toxin or radioisotope, such as the conjugation of Y\n91\n or I\n131\n to anti-CD20 antibodies (\ne.g.\n, ZevalinTM, IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corp. or Bexxar™, Coulter Pharmaceuticals) respectively, while others involve co-administration of antibodies and other therapeutic agents, such as HerceptinTM (trastuzuMAb) with paclitaxel (Genentech, Inc.). The antibodies can be conjugated to a therapeutic agent. To treat prostate cancer, for example, PSCA antibodies can be administered in conjunction with radiation, chemotherapy or hormone ablation. Also, antibodies can be conjugated to a toxin such as calicheamicin (\ne.g.\n, Mylotarg™, Wyeth-Ayerst, Madison, NJ, a recombinant humanized IgG\n4\n kappa antibody conjugated to antitumor antibiotic calicheamicin) or a maytansinoid (\ne.g.\n, taxane-based Tumor-Activated Prodrug, TAP, platform, ImmunoGen, Cambridge, MA, also see \ne.g.\n, \n \nUS Patent 5,416,064\n \n) or \nAuristatin E (Nat Biotechnol. 2003 Jul; 21(7):778-84\n. (Seattle Genetics)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough PSCA antibody therapy is useful for all stages of cancer, antibody therapy can be particularly appropriate in advanced or metastatic cancers. Treatment with the antibody therapy of the invention is indicated for patients who have received one or more rounds of chemotherapy. Alternatively, antibody therapy of the invention is combined with a chemotherapeutic or radiation regimen for patients who have not received chemotherapeutic treatment. Additionally, antibody therapy can enable the use of reduced dosages of concomitant chemotherapy, particularly for patients who do not tolerate the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent very well.\n Fan et al. (Cancer Res. 53:4637-4642, 1993\n), \nPrewett et al. (International J. of Onco. 9:217-224, 1996\n), and \nHancock et al. (Cancer Res. 51:4575-4580, 1991\n) describe the use of various antibodies together with chemotherapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough PSCA antibody therapy is useful for all stages of cancer, antibody therapy can be particularly appropriate in advanced or metastatic cancers. Treatment with the antibody therapy of the invention is indicated for patients who have received one or more rounds of chemotherapy. Alternatively, antibody therapy of the invention is combined with a chemotherapeutic or radiation regimen for patients who have not received chemotherapeutic treatment. Additionally, antibody therapy can enable the use of reduced dosages of concomitant chemotherapy, particularly for patients who do not tolerate the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent very well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancer patients can be evaluated for the presence and level of PSCA expression, preferably using immunohistochemical assessments of tumor tissue, quantitative PSCA imaging, or other techniques that reliably indicate the presence and degree of PSCA expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor biopsies or surgical specimens is preferred for this purpose. Methods for immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-PSCA monoclonal antibodies that treat prostate and other cancers include those that initiate a potent immune response against the tumor or those that are directly cytotoxic. In this regard, anti-PSCA monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) can elicit tumor cell lysis by either complement-mediated or antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) mechanisms, both of which require an intact Fc portion of the immunoglobulin molecule for interaction with effector cell Fc receptor sites on complement proteins. In addition, anti-PSCA MAbs that exert a direct biological effect on tumor growth are useful to treat cancers that express PSCA. Mechanisms by which directly cytotoxic MAbs act include: inhibition of cell growth, modulation of cellular differentiation, modulation of tumor angiogenesis factor profiles, and the induction of apoptosis. The mechanism(s) by which a particular anti-PSCA MAb exerts an anti-tumor effect is evaluated using any number of \nin vitro\n assays that evaluate cell death such as ADCC, ADMMC, complement-mediated cell lysis, and so forth, as is generally known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some patients, the use of murine or other non-human monoclonal antibodies, or human/mouse chimeric MAbs can induce moderate to strong immune responses against the non-human antibody. This can result in clearance of the antibody from circulation and reduced efficacy. In the most severe cases, such an immune response can lead to the extensive formation of immune complexes which, potentially, can cause renal failure. Accordingly, preferred monoclonal antibodies used in the therapeutic methods of the invention are those that are either fully human or humanized and that bind specifically to the target PSCA antigen with high affinity but exhibit low or no antigenicity in the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic methods of the invention contemplate the administration of single anti-PSCA MAbs as well as combinations, or cocktails, of different MAbs. Such MAb cocktails can have certain advantages inasmuch as they contain MAbs that target different epitopes, exploit different effector mechanisms or combine directly cytotoxic MAbs with MAbs that rely on immune effector functionality. Such MAbs in combination can exhibit synergistic therapeutic effects. In addition, anti-PSCA MAbs can be administered concomitantly with other therapeutic modalities, including but not limited to various chemotherapeutic agents, androgen-blockers, immune modulators (\ne.g.\n, IL-2, GM-CSF), surgery or radiation. The anti-PSCA MAbs are administered in their \"naked\" or unconjugated form, or can have a therapeutic agent(s) conjugated to them.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-PSCA antibody formulations are administered via any route capable of delivering the antibodies to a tumor cell. Routes of administration include, but are not limited to, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intratumor, intradermal, and the like. Treatment generally involves repeated administration of the anti-PSCA antibody preparation, via an acceptable route of administration such as intravenous injection (IV), typically at a dose in the range of about 0.1, .2, .3, .4, .5, .6, .7, .8, .9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, or 25 mg/kg body weight. In general, doses in the range of 10-1000 mg MAb per week are effective and well tolerated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on clinical experience with the Herceptin™ MAb in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, an initial loading dose of approximately 4 mg/kg patient body weight IV, followed by weekly doses of about 2 mg/kg IV of the anti-PSCA MAb preparation represents an acceptable dosing regimen. Preferably, the initial loading dose is administered as a 90-minute or longer infusion. The periodic maintenance dose is administered as a 30 minute or longer infusion, provided the initial dose was well tolerated. As appreciated by those of skill in the art, various factors can influence the ideal dose regimen in a particular case. Such factors include, for example, the binding affinity and half life of the Ab or MAbs used, the degree of PSCA expression in the patient, the extent of circulating shed PSCA antigen, the desired steady-state antibody concentration level, frequency of treatment, and the influence of chemotherapeutic or other agents used in combination with the treatment method of the invention, as well as the health status of a particular patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, patients should be evaluated for the levels of PSCA in a given sample (\ne.g.\n the levels of circulating PSCA antigen and/or PSCA expressing cells) in order to assist in the determination of the most effective dosing regimen, etc. Such evaluations are also used for monitoring purposes throughout therapy, and are useful to gauge therapeutic success in combination with the evaluation of other parameters (for example, urine cytology and/or ImmunoCyt levels in bladder cancer therapy, or by analogy, serum PSA levels in prostate cancer therapy).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-idiotypic anti-PSCA antibodies can also be used in anti-cancer therapy as a vaccine for inducing an immune response to cells expressing a PSCA-related protein. In particular, the generation of anti-idiotypic antibodies is well known in the art; this methodology can readily be adapted to generate anti-idiotypic anti-PSCA antibodies that mimic an epitope on a PSCA-related protein (see, for example, \nWagner et al., 1997, Hybridoma 16: 33-40\n; \nFoon et al., 1995, J. Clin. Invest. 96:334-342\n; \nHerlyn et al., 1996, Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 43:65-76\n). Such an anti-idiotypic antibody can be used in cancer vaccine strategies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn object of the present invention is to provide PSCA antibodies, which inhibit or retard the growth of tumor cells expressing PSCA. A further object of this invention is to provide methods to inhibit angiogenesis and other biological functions and thereby reduce tumor growth in mammals, preferably humans, using such PSCA antibodies, and in particular using such PSCA antibodies combined with radiation and chemotherapy or both.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, there is synergy when tumors, including human tumors, are treated with PSCA antibodies in conjunction with chemotherapeutic agents or radiation or combinations thereof. In other words, the inhibition of tumor growth by a PSCA antibody is enhanced more than expected when combined with chemotherapeutic agents or radiation or combinations thereof. Synergy may be shown, for example, by greater inhibition of tumor growth with combined treatment than would be expected from a treatment of only PSCA antibodies or the additive effect of treatment with a PSCA antibody and a chemotherapeutic agent or radiation. Preferably, synergy is demonstrated by remission of the cancer where remission is not expected from treatment either from a naked PSCA antibody or with treatment using an additive combination of a PSCA antibody and a chemotherapeutic agent or radiation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method for inhibiting growth of tumor cells using a PSCA antibody and a combination of chemotherapy or radiation or both comprises administering the PSCA antibody before, during, or after commencing chemotherapy or radiation therapy, as well as any combination thereof (\ni.e.\n before and during, before and after, during and after, or before, during, and after commencing the chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy). For example, the PSCA antibody is typically administered between 1 and 60 days, preferably between 3 and 40 days, more preferably between 5 and 12 days before commencing radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. However, depending on the treatment protocol and the specific patient needs, the method is performed in a manner that will provide the most efficacious treatment and ultimately prolong the life of the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe administration of chemotherapeutic agents can be accomplished in a variety of ways including systemically by the parenteral and enteral routes. In one embodiment, the PSCA antibody and the chemotherapeutic agent are administered as separate molecules. In another embodiment, the PSCA antibody is attached, for example, by conjugation, to a chemotherapeutic agent. (See the Example entitled \"Human Clinical Trials for the Treatment and Diagnosis of Human Carcinomas through use of Human Anti-PSCA Antibodies in vivo\") and (See section entitled \"PSCA as a Target for Antibody-based Therapy\"). Particular examples of chemotherapeutic agents or chemotherapy include cisplatin, dacarbazine (DTIC), dactinomycin, mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard), streptozocin, cyclophosphamide, carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), doxorubicin (adriamycin), daunorubicin, procarbazine, mitomycin, cytarabine, etoposide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vinblastine, vincristine, bleomycin, paclitaxel (taxol), docetaxcl (taxotere), aldesleukin, asparaginase, busulfan, carboplatin, cladribine, dacarbazine, floxuridine, fludarabine, hydroxyurea, ifosfamide, interferon alpha, leuprolide, megestrol, melphalan, mercaptopurine, plicamycin, mitotane, pegaspargase, pentostatin, pipobroman, plicamycin, streptozocin, tamoxifen, teniposide, testolactone, thioguanine, thiotepa, uracil mustard, vinorelbine, chlorambucil, taxol and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe source of radiation, used in combination with a PSCA antibody, can be either external or internal to the patient being treated. When the source is external to the patient, the therapy is known as external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). When the source of radiation is s internal to the patient, the treatment is called brachytherapy (BT).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe radiation is administered in accordance with well known standard techniques using standard equipment manufactured for this purpose, such as AECL Theratron and Varian Clinac. The dose of radiation depends on numerous factors as is well known in the art. Such factors include the organ being treated, the healthy organs in the path of the radiation that might inadvertently be adversely affected, the tolerance of the patient for radiation therapy, and the area of the body in need of treatment. The dose will typically be between 1 and 100 Gy, and more particularly between 2 and 80 Gy. Some doses that have been reported include 35 Gy to the spinal cord, 15 Gy to the kidneys, 20 Gy to the liver, and 65-80 Gy to the prostate. It should be emphasized, however, that the invention is not limited to any particular dose. The dose will be determined by the treating physician in accordance with the particular factors in a given situation, including the factors mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe distance between the source of the external radiation and the point of entry into the patient may be any distance that represents an acceptable balance between killing target cells and minimizing side effects. Typically, the source of the external radiation is between 70 and 100 cm from the point of entry into the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBrachytherapy is generally carried out by placing the source of radiation in the patient. Typically, the source of radiation is placed approximately 0-3 cm from the tissue being treated. Known techniques include interstitial, intercavitary, and surface brachytherapy. The radioactive seeds can be implanted permanently or temporarily. Some typical radioactive atoms that have been used in permanent implants include iodine-125 and radon. Some typical radioactive atoms that have been used in temporary implants include radium, cesium-137, and iridium- 192. Some additional radioactive atoms that have been used in brachytherapy include americium-241 and gold-198.The dose of radiation for brachytherapy can be the same as that mentioned above for external beam radiation therapy. In addition to the factors mentioned above for determining the dose of external beam radiation therapy, the nature of the radioactive atom used is also taken into account in determining the dose of brachytherapy.\n\n\n \nX.C.) PSCA as a Target for Cellular Immune Responses\n\n\n \n \n \nVaccines and methods of preparing vaccines that contain an immunogenically effective amount of one or more HLA-binding peptides as described herein are further embodiments of the invention. Furthermore, vaccines in accordance with the invention encompass compositions of one or more of the claimed peptides. A peptide can be present in a vaccine individually. Alternatively, the peptide can exist as a homopolymer comprising multiple copies of the same peptide, or as a heteropolymer of various peptides. Polymers have the advantage of increased immunological reaction and, where different peptide epitopes are used to make up the polymer, the additional ability to induce antibodies and/or CTLs that react with different antigenic determinants of the pathogenic organism or tumor-related peptide targeted for an immune response. The composition can be a naturally occurring region of an antigen or can be prepared, \ne.g.\n, recombinantly or by chemical synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarriers that can be used with vaccines of the invention are well known in the art, and include, \ne.g.\n, thyroglobulin, albumins such as human serum albumin, tetanus toxoid, polyamino acids such as poly L-lysine, poly L-glutamic acid, influenza, hepatitis B virus core protein, and the like. The vaccines can contain a physiologically tolerable (\ni.e.\n, acceptable) diluent such as water, or saline, preferably phosphate buffered saline. The vaccines also typically include an adjuvant. Adjuvants such as incomplete Freund's adjuvant, aluminum phosphate, aluminum hydroxide, or alum are examples of materials well known in the art. Additionally, as disclosed herein, CTL responses can be primed by conjugating peptides of the invention to lipids, such as tripalmitoyl-S-glycerylcysteinlyseryl- serine (P\n3\nCSS). Moreover, an adjuvant such as a synthetic cytosine-phosphorothiolated-guanine-containing (CpG) oligonucleotides has been found to increase CTL responses 10- to 100-fold (see, \ne.g.\n \nDavila and Celis, J. Immunol. 165:539-547 (2000\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon immunization with a peptide composition in accordance with the invention, via injection, aerosol, oral, transdermal, transmucosal, intrapleural, intrathecal, or other suitable routes, the immune system of the host responds to the vaccine by producing large amounts of CTLs and/or HTLs specific for the desired antigen. Consequently, the host becomes at least partially immune to later development of cells that express or overexpress PSCA antigen, or derives at least some therapeutic benefit when the antigen was tumor-associated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, it may be desirable to combine the class I peptide components with components that induce or facilitate neutralizing antibody and or helper T cell responses directed to the target antigen. A preferred embodiment of such a composition comprises class I and class II epitopes in accordance with the invention. An alternative embodiment of such a composition comprises a class I and/or class II epitope in accordance with the invention, along with a cross reactive HTL epitope such as PADRE™ (Epimmune, San Diego, CA) molecule (described \ne.g.,\n in \n \nU.S. Patent Number 5,736,142\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vaccine of the invention can also include antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DC), as a vehicle to present peptides of the invention. Vaccine compositions can be created \nin vitro,\n following dendritic cell mobilization and harvesting, whereby loading of dendritic cells occurs \nin vitro.\n For example, dendritic cells are transfected, \ne.g.,\n with a minigene in accordance with the invention, or are pulsed with peptides. The dendritic cell can then be administered to a patient to elicit immune responses \nin vivo\n. Vaccine compositions, either DNA- or peptide-based, can also be administered \nin vivo\n in combination with dendritic cell mobilization whereby loading of dendritic cells occurs \nin vivo\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the following principles are utilized when selecting an array of epitopes for inclusion in a polyepitopic composition for use in a vaccine, or for selecting discrete epitopes to be included in a vaccine and/or to be encoded by nucleic acids such as a minigene. It is preferred that each of the following principles be balanced in order to make the selection. The multiple epitopes to be incorporated in a given vaccine composition may be, but need not be, contiguous in sequence in the native antigen from which the epitopes are derived.\n\n \n \n \n1.) Epitopes are selected which, upon administration, mimic immune responses that have been observed to be correlated with tumor clearance. For HLA Class I this includes 3-4 epitopes that come from at least one tumor associated antigen (TAA). For HLA Class II a similar rationale is employed; again 3-4 epitopes are selected from at least one TAA (see, \ne.g.\n, \nRosenberg et al., Science 278:1447-1450\n). Epitopes from one TAA may be used in combination with epitopes from one or more additional TAAs to produce a vaccine that targets tumors with varying expression patterns of frequently-expressed TAAs.\n \n2.) Epitopes are selected that have the requisite binding affinity established to be correlated with immunogenicity: for HLA Class I an IC\n50\n of 500 nM or less, often 200 nM or less; and for Class II an IC\n50\n of 1000 nM or less.\n \n3.) Sufficient supermotif bearing-peptides, or a sufficient array of allele-specific motif-bearing peptides, are selected to give broad population coverage. For example, it is preferable to have at least 80% population coverage. A Monte Carlo analysis, a statistical evaluation known in the art, can be employed to assess the breadth, or redundancy of, population coverage.\n \n4.) When selecting epitopes from cancer-related antigens it is often useful to select analogs because the patient may have developed tolerance to the native epitope,\n \n5.) Of particular relevance are epitopes referred to as \"nested epitopes.\" Nested epitopes occur where at least two epitopes overlap in a given peptide sequence. A nested peptide sequence can comprise B cell, HLA class I and/or HLA class II epitopes. When providing nested epitopes, a general objective is to provide the greatest number of epitopes per sequence. Thus, an aspect is to avoid providing a peptide that is any longer than the amino terminus of the amino terminal epitope and the carboxyl terminus of the carboxyl terminal epitope in the peptide. When providing a multi-epitopic sequence, such as a sequence comprising nested epitopes, it is generally important to screen the sequence in order to insure that it does not have pathological or other deleterious biological properties.\n \n6.) If a polyepitopic protein is created, or when creating a minigene, an objective is to generate the smallest peptide that encompasses the epitopes of interest. This principle is similar, if not the same as that employed when selecting a peptide comprising nested epitopes. However, with an artificial polyepitopic peptide, the size minimization objective is balanced against the need to integrate any spacer sequences between epitopes in the polyepitopic protein. Spacer amino acid residues can, for example, be introduced to avoid junctional epitopes (an epitope recognized by the immune system, not present in the target antigen, and only created by the man-made juxtaposition of epitopes), or to facilitate cleavage between epitopes and thereby enhance epitope presentation. Junctional epitopes are generally to be avoided because the recipient may generate an immune response to that non-native epitope. Of particular concern is a junctional epitope that is a \"dominant epitope.\" A dominant epitope may lead to such a zealous response that immune responses to other epitopes are diminished or suppressed.\n \n7.) Where the sequences of multiple variants of the same target protein are present, potential peptide epitopes can also be selected on the basis of their conservancy. For example, a criterion for conservancy may define that the entire sequence of an HLA class I binding peptide or the entire 9-mer core of a class II binding peptide be conserved in a designated percentage of the sequences evaluated for a specific protein antigen.\n \n\n\nX.C.1. Minigene Vaccines\n\n\n \n \n \nA number of different approaches are available which allow simultaneous delivery of multiple epitopes. Nucleic acids encoding the peptides of the invention are a particularly useful embodiment of the invention. Epitopes for inclusion in a minigene are preferably selected according to the guidelines set forth in the previous section. A preferred means of administering nucleic acids encoding the peptides of the invention uses minigene constructs encoding a peptide comprising one or multiple epitopes of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of multi-epitope minigenes is described below and in, \nIshioka et al., J. Immunol. 162:3915-3925, 1999\n; \nAn, L. and Whitton, J. L., J. Virol. 71:2292, 1997\n; \nThomson, S. A. et al., J. Immunol. 157:822, 1996\n; \nWhitton, J. L. et al., J. Viol. 67:348, 1993\n; \nHanke, R. et al., Vaccine 16:426, 1998\n. For example, a multi-epitope DNA plasmid encoding supermotif-and/or motif-bearing epitopes derived PSCA, the PADRE™ universal helper T cell epitope or multiple HTL epitopes from PSCA (see \ne.g.\n, Tables V-XVIII and XXII to LI), and an endoplasmic reticulum-translocating signal sequence can be engineered. A vaccine may also comprise epitopes that are derived from other TAAs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe immunogenicity of a multi-epitopic minigene can be confirmed in transgenic mice to evaluate the magnitude of CTL induction responses against the epitopes tested. Further, the immunogenicity of DNA-encoded epitopes \nin vivo\n can be correlated with the \nin vitro\n responses of specific CTL lines against target cells transfected with the DNA plasmid. Thus, these experiments can show that the minigene serves to both: 1.) generate a CTL response and 2.) that the induced CTLs recognized cells expressing the encoded epitopes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, to create a DNA sequence encoding the selected epitopes (minigene) for expression in human cells, the amino acid sequences of the epitopes may be reverse translated. A human codon usage table can be used to guide the codon choice for each amino acid. These epitope-encoding DNA sequences may be directly adjoined, so that when translated, a continuous polypeptide sequence is created. To optimize expression and/or immunogenicity, additional elements can be incorporated into the minigene design. Examples of amino acid sequences that can be reverse translated and included in the minigene sequence include: HLA class I epitopes, HLA class II epitopes, antibody epitopes, a ubiquitination signal sequence, and/or an endoplasmic reticulum targeting signal. In addition, HLA presentation of CTL and HTL epitopes may be improved by including synthetic (\ne.g.\n poly-alanine) or naturally-occurring flanking sequences adjacent to the CTL or HTL epitopes; these larger peptides comprising the epitope(s) are within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe minigene sequence may be converted to DNA by assembling oligonucleotides that encode the plus and minus strands of the minigene. Overlapping oligonucleotides (30-100 bases long) may be synthesized, phosphorylated, purified and annealed under appropriate conditions using well known techniques. The ends of the oligonucleotides can be joined, for example, using T4 DNA ligase. This synthetic minigene, encoding the epitope polypeptide, can then be cloned into a desired expression vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStandard regulatory sequences well known to those of skill in the art are preferably included in the vector to ensure expression in the target cells. Several vector elements are desirable: a promoter with a down-stream cloning site for minigene insertion; a polyadenylation signal for efficient transcription termination; an \nE. coli\n origin of replication; and an \nE. coli\n selectable marker (\ne.g.\n, ampicillin or kanamycin resistance). Numerous promoters can be used for this purpose, \ne.g.,\n the human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) promoter. See, \ne.g.,\n \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,580,859\n \n and \n \n5,589,466\n \n for other suitable promoter sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional vector modifications may be desired to optimize minigene expression and immunogenicity. In some cases, introns are required for efficient gene expression, and one or more synthetic or naturally-occurring introns could be incorporated into the transcribed region of the minigene. The inclusion of mRNA stabilization sequences and sequences for replication in mammalian cells may also be considered for increasing minigene expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce an expression vector is selected, the minigene is cloned into the polylinker region downstream of the promoter. This plasmid is transformed into an appropriate \nE. coli\n strain, and DNA is prepared using standard techniques. The orientation and DNA sequence of the minigene, as well as all other elements included in the vector, are confirmed using restriction mapping and DNA sequence analysis. Bacterial cells harboring the correct plasmid can be stored as a master cell bank and a working cell bank.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, immunostimulatory sequences (ISSs or CpGs) appear to play a role in the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. These sequences may be included in the vector, outside the minigene coding sequence, if desired to enhance immunogenicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a bi-cistronic expression vector which allows production of both the minigene-encoded epitopes and a second protein (included to enhance or decrease immunogenicity) can be used. Examples of proteins or polypeptides that could beneficially enhance the immune response if co-expressed include cytokines (\ne.g.\n, IL-2, IL-12, GM-CSF), cytokine-inducing molecules (\ne\n.\ng.\n, LeIF), costimulatory molecules, or for HTL responses, pan-DR binding proteins (PADRE™, Epimmune, San Diego, CA). Helper (HTL) epitopes can be joined to intracellular targeting signals and expressed separately from expressed CTL epitopes; this allows direction of the HTL epitopes to a cell compartment different than that of the CTL epitopes. If required, this could facilitate more efficient entry of HTL epitopes into the HLA class II pathway, thereby improving HTL induction. In contrast to HTL or CTL induction, specifically decreasing the immune response by co-expression of immunosuppressive molecules (\ne.g.\n TGF-β) may be beneficial in certain diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic quantities of plasmid DNA can be produced for example, by fermentation in \nE. coli\n, followed by purification. Aliquots from the working cell bank are used to inoculate growth medium, and grown to saturation in shaker flasks or a bioreactor according to well-known techniques. Plasmid DNA can be purified using standard bioseparation technologies such as solid phase anion-exchange resins supplied by QIAGEN, Inc. (Valencia, California). If required, supercoiled DNA can be isolated from the open circular and linear forms using gel electrophoresis or other methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurified plasmid DNA can be prepared for injection using a variety of formulations, The simplest of these is reconstitution of lyophilized DNA in sterile phosphate-buffer saline (PBS). This approach, known as \"naked DNA,\" is currently being used for intramuscular (IM) administration in clinical trials. To maximize the immunotherapeutic effects of minigene DNA vaccines, an alternative method for formulating purified plasmid DNA may be desirable. A variety of methods have been described, and new techniques may become available. Cationic lipids, glycolipids, and fusogenic liposomes can also be used in the formulation (see, \ne.g.\n, as described by \n \nWO 93/24640\n \n; \nMannino & Gould-Fogerite, BioTechniques 6(7): 682 (1988\n); \n \nU.S. Pat No. 5,279,833\n \n; \n \nWO 91/06309\n \n; and \nFeigner, et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 84:7413 (1987\n). In addition, peptides and compounds referred to collectively as protective, interactive, non-condensing compounds (PINC) could also be complexed to purified plasmid DNA to influence variables such as stability, intramuscular dispersion, or trafficking to specific organs or cell types.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTarget cell sensitization can be used as a functional assay for expression and HLA class I presentation of minigene-encoded CTL epitopes. For example, the plasmid DNA is introduced into a mammalian cell line that is suitable as a target for standard CTL chromium release assays. The transfection method used will be dependent on the final formulation. Electroporation can be used for \"naked\" DNA, whereas cationic lipids allow direct \nin vitro\n transfection. A plasmid expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) can be co-transfected to allow enrichment of transfected cells using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). These cells are then chromium-51 (\n51\nCr) labeled and used as target cells for epitope-specific CTL lines; cytolysis, detected by \n51\nCr release, indicates both production of, and HLA presentation of, minigene-encoded CTL epitopes. Expression of HTL epitopes may be evaluated in an analogous manner using assays to assess HTL activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIn vivo\n immunogenicity is a second approach for functional testing of minigene DNA formulations. Transgenic mice expressing appropriate human HLA proteins are immunized with the DNA product. The dose and route of administration are formulation dependent (\ne.g.\n, IM for DNA in PBS, intraperitoneal (i.p.) for lipid-complexed DNA). Twenty-one days after immunization, splenocytes are harvested and restimulated for one week in the presence of peptides encoding each epitope being tested. Thereafter, for CTL effector cells, assays are conducted for cytolysis of peptide-loaded, \n51\nCr-labeled target cells using standard techniques. Lysis of target cells that were sensitized by HLA loaded with peptide epitopes, corresponding to minigene-encoded epitopes, demonstrates DNA vaccine function for \nin vivo\n induction of CTLs. Immunogenicity of HTL epitopes is confirmed in transgenic mice in an analogous manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the nucleic acids can be administered using ballistic delivery as described, for instance, in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,204,253\n \n. Using this technique, particles comprised solely of DNA are administered. In a further alternative embodiment, DNA can be adhered to particles, such as gold particles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMinigenes can also be delivered using other bacterial or viral delivery systems well known in the art, \ne.g.\n, an expression construct encoding epitopes of the invention can be incorporated into a viral vector such as vaccinia.\n\n\n \nX.C.2. Combinations of CTL Peptides with Helper Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nVaccine compositions comprising CTL peptides of the invention can be modified, \ne.g.\n, analoged, to provide desired attributes, such as improved serum half life, broadened population coverage or enhanced immunogenicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor instance, the ability of a peptide to induce CTL activity can be enhanced by linking the peptide to a sequence which contains at least one epitope that is capable of inducing a T helper cell response. Although a CTL peptide can be directly linked to a T helper peptide, often CTL epitope/HTL epitope conjugates are linked by a spacer molecule. The spacer is typically comprised of relatively small, neutral molecules, such as amino acids or amino acid mimetics, which are substantially uncharged under physiological conditions. The spacers are typically selected from, \ne.g.\n, Ala, Gly, or other neutral spacers of nonpolar amino acids or neutral polar amino acids. It will be understood that the optionally present spacer need not be comprised of the same residues and thus may be a hetero- or homo-oligomer. When present, the spacer will usually be at least one or two residues, more usually three to six residues and sometimes 10 or more residues. The CTL peptide epitope can be linked to the T helper peptide epitope either directly or via a spacer either at the amino or carboxy terminus of the CTL peptide. The amino terminus of either the immunogenic peptide or the T helper peptide may be acylated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHTL peptide epitopes can also be modified to alter their biological properties. For example, they can be modified to include D-amino acids to increase their resistance to proteases and thus extend their serum half life, or they can be conjugated to other molecules such as lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and the like to increase their biological activity. For example, a T helper peptide can be conjugated to one or more palmitic acid chains at either the amino or carboxyl termini.\n\n\n \nX.C.3. Combinations of CTL Peptides with T Cell Priming Agents\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments it may be desirable to include in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention at least one component which primes B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. Lipids have been identified as agents capable of priming CTL \nin vivo\n. For example, palmitic acid residues can be attached to the ε-and α- amino groups of a lysine residue and then linked, \ne.g.\n, via one or more linking residues such as Gly, Gly-Gly-, Ser, Ser-Ser, or the like, to an immunogenic peptide. The lipidated peptide can then be administered either directly in a micelle or particle, incorporated into a liposome, or emulsified in an adjuvant, \ne.g.\n, incomplete Freund's adjuvant. In a preferred embodiment, a particularly effective immunogenic composition comprises palmitic acid attached to ε-and α- amino groups of Lys, which is attached via linkage, \ne.g.\n, Ser-Ser, to the amino terminus of the immunogenic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs another example of lipid priming of CTL responses, \nE. coli\n lipoproteins, such as tripalmitoyl-S-glycerylcysteinlyseryl- serine (P\n3\nCSS) can be used to prime virus specific CTL when covalently attached to an appropriate peptide (see, \ne.g.\n,\n Deres, et al., Nature 342:561, 1989\n). Peptides of the invention can be coupled to P3CSS, for example, and the lipopeptide administered to an individual to prime specifically an immune response to the target antigen. Moreover, because the induction of neutralizing antibodies can also be primed with P3CSS-conjugated epitopes, two such compositions can be combined to more effectively elicit both humoral and cell-mediated responses.\n\n\n \nX.C.4. Vaccine Compositions Comprising DC Pulsed with CTL and/or HTL Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nAn embodiment of a vaccine composition in accordance with the invention comprises \nex vivo\n administration of a cocktail of epitope-bearing peptides to PBMC, or isolated DC therefrom, from the patient's blood. A pharmaceutical to facilitate harvesting of DC can be used, such as Progenipoietin™ (Pharmacia-Monsanto, St. Louis, MO) or GM-CSF/IL-4. After pulsing the DC with peptides and prior to reinfusion into patients, the DC are washed to remove unbound peptides. In this embodiment, a vaccine comprises peptide-pulsed DCs which present the pulsed peptide epitopes complexed with HLA molecules on their surfaces.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DC can be pulsed \nex vivo\n with a cocktail of peptides, some of which stimulate CTL responses to PSCA. Optionally, a helper T cell (HTL) peptide, such as a natural or artificial loosely restricted HLA Class II peptide, can be included to facilitate the CTL response. Thus, a vaccine in accordance with the invention is used to treat a cancer which expresses or overexpresses PSCA.\n\n\n \nX.D.) Adoptive Immunotherapy\n\n\n \n \n \nAntigenic PSCA-related peptides are used to elicit a CTL and/or HTL response \nex vivo\n, as well. The resulting CTL or HTL cells, can be used to treat tumors in patients that do not respond to other conventional forms of therapy, or will not respond to a therapeutic vaccine peptide or nucleic acid in accordance with the invention. \nEx vivo\n CTL or HTL responses to a particular antigen are induced by incubating in tissue culture the patient's, or genetically compatible, CTL or HTL precursor cells together with a source of antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells, and the appropriate immunogenic peptide. After an appropriate incubation time (typically about 7-28 days), in which the precursor cells are activated and expanded into effector cells, the cells are infused back into the patient, where they will destroy (CTL) or facilitate destruction (HTL) of their specific target cell (\ne.g.\n, a tumor cell). Transfected dendritic cells may also be used as antigen presenting cells.\n\n\n \nX.E.) Administration of Vaccines for Therapeutic or Prophylactic Purposes\n\n\n \n \n \nPharmaceutical and vaccine compositions of the invention are typically used to treat and/or prevent a cancer that expresses or overexpresses PSCA. In therapeutic applications, peptide and/or nucleic acid compositions are administered to a patient in an amount sufficient to elicit an effective B cell, CTL and/or HTL response to the antigen and to cure or at least partially arrest or slow symptoms and/or complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as \"therapeutically effective dose.\" Amounts effective for this use will depend on, \ne.g.\n, the particular composition administered, the manner of administration, the stage and severity of the disease being treated, the weight and general state of health of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor pharmaceutical compositions, the immunogenic peptides of the invention, or DNA encoding them, are generally administered to an individual already bearing a tumor that expresses PSCA. The peptides or DNA encoding them can be administered individually or as fusions of one or more peptide sequences. Patients can be treated with the immunogenic peptides separately or in conjunction with other treatments, such as surgery, as appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor therapeutic use, administration should generally begin at the first diagnosis of PSCA-associated cancer. This is followed by boosting doses until at least symptoms are substantially abated and for a period thereafter. The embodiment of the vaccine composition (\ni.e.\n, including, but not limited to embodiments such as peptide cocktails, polyepitopic polypeptides, minigenes, or TAA-specific CTLs or pulsed dendritic cells) delivered to the patient may vary according to the stage of the disease or the patient's health status. For example, in a patient with a tumor that expresses PSCA, a vaccine comprising PSCA-specific CTL may be more efficacious in killing tumor cells in patient with advanced disease than alternative embodiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is generally important to provide an amount of the peptide epitope delivered by a mode of administration sufficient to stimulate effectively a cytotoxic T cell response; compositions which stimulate helper T cell responses can also be given in accordance with this embodiment of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage for an initial therapeutic immunization generally occurs in a unit dosage range where the lower value is about 1, 5, 50, 500, or 1,000 µg and the higher value is about 10,000; 20,000; 30,000; or 50,000 µg. Dosage values for a human typically range from about 500 µg to about 50,000 µg per 70 kilogram patient. Boosting dosages of between about 1.0 µg to about 50,000 µg of peptide pursuant to a boosting regimen over weeks to months may be administered depending upon the patient's response and condition as determined by measuring the specific activity of CTL and HTL obtained from the patient's blood. Administration should continue until at least clinical symptoms or laboratory tests indicate that the neoplasia, has been eliminated or reduced and for a period thereafter. The dosages, routes of administration, and dose schedules are adjusted in accordance with methodologies known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the peptides and compositions of the present invention are employed in serious disease states, that is, life-threatening or potentially life threatening situations. In such cases, as a result of the minimal amounts of extraneous substances and the relative nontoxic nature of the peptides in preferred compositions of the invention, it is possible and may be felt desirable by the treating physician to administer substantial excesses of these peptide compositions relative to these stated dosage amounts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe vaccine compositions of the invention can also be used purely as prophylactic agents. Generally the dosage for an initial prophylactic immunization generally occurs in a unit dosage range where the lower value is about 1, 5, 50, 500, or 1000 µg and the higher value is about 10,000; 20,000; 30,000; or 50,000 µg. Dosage values for a human typically range from about 500 µg to about 50,000 µg per 70 kilogram patient. This is followed by boosting dosages of between about 1.0 µg to about 50,000 µg of peptide administered at defined intervals from about four weeks to six months after the initial administration of vaccine. The immunogenicity of the vaccine can be assessed by measuring the specific activity of CTL and HTL obtained from a sample of the patient's blood.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions for therapeutic treatment are intended for parenteral, topical, oral, nasal, intrathecal, or local (\ne.g.\n as a cream or topical ointment) administration. Preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered parentally, \ne.g.\n, intravenously, subcutaneously, intradermally, or intramuscularly. Thus, the invention provides compositions for parenteral administration which comprise a solution of the immunogenic peptides dissolved or suspended in an acceptable carrier, preferably an aqueous carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of aqueous carriers may be used, \ne.g.\n, water, buffered water, 0.8% saline, 0.3% glycine, hyaluronic acid and the like. These compositions may be sterilized by conventional, well-known sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile solution prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH-adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, wetting agents, preservatives, and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe concentration of peptides of the invention in the pharmaceutical formulations can vary widely, \ni.e.\n, from less than about 0.1%, usually at or at least about 2% to as much as 20% to 50% or more by weight, and will be selected primarily by fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA human unit dose form of a composition is typically included in a pharmaceutical composition that comprises a human unit dose of an acceptable carrier, in one embodiment an aqueous carrier, and is administered in a volume/quantity that is known by those of skill in the art to be used for administration of such compositions to humans (see, \ne.g.\n, \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th Edition, A. Gennaro, Editor, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pennsylvania, 1985\n). For example a peptide dose for initial immunization can be from about 1 to about 50,000 µg, generally 100-5,000 µg, for a 70 kg patient. For example, for nucleic acids an initial immunization may be performed using an expression vector in the form of naked nucleic acid administered IM (or SC or ID) in the amounts of 0.5-5 mg at multiple sites. The nucleic acid (0.1 to 1000 µg) can also be administered using a gene gun. Following an incubation period of 3-4 weeks, a booster dose is then administered. The booster can be recombinant fowlpox virus administered at a dose of 5-10\n7\n to 5x10\n9\n pfu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor antibodies, a treatment generally involves repeated administration of the anti-PSCA antibody preparation, via an acceptable route of administration such as intravenous injection (IV), typically at a dose in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg body weight. In general, doses in the range of 10-500 mg MAb per week are effective and well tolerated. Moreover, an initial loading dose of approximately 4 mg/kg patient body weight IV, followed by weekly doses of about 2 mg/kg IV of the anti- PSCA MAb preparation represents an acceptable dosing regimen. As appreciated by those of skill in the art, various factors can influence the ideal dose in a particular case. Such factors include, for example, half life of a composition, the binding affinity of an Ab, the immunogenicity of a substance, the degree of PSCA expression in the patient, the extent of circulating shed PSCA antigen, the desired steady-state concentration level, frequency of treatment, and the influence of chemotherapeutic or other agents used in combination with the treatment method of the invention, as well as the health status of a particular patient. Non-limiting preferred human unit doses are, for example, 500µg - 1mg, 1mg - 50mg, 50mg - 100mg, 100mg - 200mg, 200mg - 300mg, 400mg - 500mg, 500mg - 600mg, 600mg - 700mg, 700mg - 800mg, 800mg - 900mg, 900mg - 1g, or 1mg - 700mg. In certain embodiments, the dose is in a range of 2-5 mg/kg body weight, \ne.g.\n, with follow on weekly doses of 1-3 mg/kg; 0.5mg, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10mg/kg body weight followed, \ne.g.\n, in two, three or four weeks by weekly doses; 0.5 - 10mg/kg body weight, \ne.g.\n, followed in two, three or four weeks by weekly doses; 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 350, 375, 400mg m\n2\n of body area weekly; 1-600mg m\n2\n of body area weekly; 225-400mg m\n2\n of body area weekly; these does can be followed by weekly doses for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 19, 11, 12 or more weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, human unit dose forms of polynucleotides comprise a suitable dosage range or effective amount that provides any therapeutic effect. As appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art a therapeutic effect depends on a number of factors, including the sequence of the polynucleotide, molecular weight of the polynucleotide and route of administration. Dosages are generally selected by the physician or other health care professional in accordance with a variety of parameters known in the art, such as severity of symptoms, history of the patient and the like. Generally, for a polynucleotide of about 20 bases, a dosage range may be selected from, for example, an independently selected lower limit such as about 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400 or 500 mg/kg up to an independently selected upper limit, greater than the lower limit, of about 60, 80, 100, 200, 340, 400, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000 or 10,000 mg/kg, For example, a dose may be about any of the following: 0.1 to 100 mg/kg, 0.1 to 50 mg/kg, 0.1 to 25 mg/kg, 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, 1 to 500 mg/kg, 100 to 400 mg/kg, 200 to 300 mg/kg, 1 to 100 mg/kg, 100 to 200 mg/kg, 300 to 400 mg/kg, 400 to 500 mg/kg, 500 to 1000 mg/kg, 500 to 5000 mg/kg, or 500 to 10,000 mg/kg. Generally, parenteral routes of administration may require higher doses of polynucleotide compared to more direct application to the nucleotide to diseased tissue, as do polynucleotides of increasing length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, human unit dose forms of T-cells comprise a suitable dosage range or effective amount that provides any therapeutic effect. As appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, a therapeutic effect depends on a number of factors. Dosages are generally selected by the physician or other health care professional in accordance with a variety of parameters known in the art, such as severity of symptoms, history of the patient and the like. A dose may be about 10\n4\n cells to about 10\n6\n cells, about 10\n6\n cells to about 10\n8\n cells, about 10\n8\n to about 10\n11\n cells, or about 10\n8\n to about 5x10\n10\n cells. A dose may also about 10\n6\n cells/m\n2\n to about 10\n10\n cells/m\n2\n, or about 10\n6\n cells/m\n2\n to about 108 cells/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProteins(s) of the invention, and/or nucleic acids encoding the protein(s), can also be administered via liposomes, which may also serve to: 1) target the proteins(s) to a particular tissue, such as lymphoid tissue; 2) to target selectively to diseases cells; or, 3) to increase the half-life of the peptide composition. Liposomes include emulsions, foams, micelles, insoluble monolayers, liquid crystals, phospholipid dispersions, lamellar layers and the like. In these preparations, the peptide to be delivered is incorporated as part of a liposome, alone or in conjunction with a molecule which binds to a receptor prevalent among lymphoid cells, such as monoclonal antibodies which bind to the CD45 antigen, or with other therapeutic or immunogenic compositions. Thus, liposomes either filled or decorated with a desired peptide of the invention can be directed to the site of lymphoid cells, where the liposomes then deliver the peptide compositions. Liposomes for use in accordance with the invention are formed from standard vesicle-forming lipids, which generally include neutral and negatively charged phospholipids and a sterol, such as cholesterol. The selection of lipids is generally guided by consideration of, \ne.g.\n, liposome size, acid lability and stability of the liposomes in the blood stream. A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in, \ne.g.\n, \nSzoka, et al., Ann. Rev. Biophys, Bioeng. 9:467 (1980\n), and \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 4,235,871\n \n, \n \n4,501,728\n \n, \n \n4,837,028\n \n, and \n \n5,019,369\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor targeting cells of the immune system, a ligand to be incorporated into the liposome can include, \ne.g.\n, antibodies or fragments thereof specific for cell surface determinants of the desired immune system cells. A liposome suspension containing a peptide may be administered intravenously, locally, topically, etc. in a dose which varies according to, inter alia, the manner of administration, the peptide being delivered, and the stage of the disease being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor solid compositions, conventional nontoxic solid carriers may be used which include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like. For oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic composition is formed by incorporating any of the normally employed excipients, such as those carriers previously listed, and generally 10-95% of active ingredient, that is, one or more peptides of the invention, and more preferably at a concentration of 25%-75%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor aerosol administration, immunogenic peptides are preferably supplied in finely divided form along with a surfactant and propellant. Typical percentages of peptides are about 0.01%-20% by weight, preferably about 1%-10%. The surfactant must, of course, be nontoxic, and preferably soluble in the propellant. Representative of such agents are the esters or partial esters of fatty acids containing from about 6 to 22 carbon atoms, such as caproic, octanoic, lauric, palmitic, stearic, linoleic, linolenic, olesteric and oleic acids with an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol or its cyclic anhydride. Mixed esters, such as mixed or natural glycerides may be employed. The surfactant may constitute about 0.1 %-20% by weight of the composition, preferably about 0.25-5%. The balance of the composition is ordinarily propellant. A carrier can also be included, as desired, as with, \ne.g.\n, lecithin for intranasal delivery.\n\n\n \nXI.) Diagnostic and Prognostic Embodiments of PSCA.\n\n\n \n \n \nAs disclosed herein, PSCA polynucleotides, polypeptides, reactive cytotoxic T cells (CTL), reactive helper T cells (HTL) and anti-polypeptide antibodies are used in well known diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic assays that examine conditions associated with dysregulated cell growth such as cancer, in particular the cancers listed in Table I (see, \ne.g.\n, both its specific pattern of tissue expression as well as its overexpression in certain cancers as described for example in the Example entitled \"Expression analysis of PSCA in normal tissues, and patient specimens\").\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPSCA can be analogized to a prostate associated antigen PSA, the archetypal marker that has been used by medical practitioners for years to identify and monitor the presence of prostate cancer (see, \ne.g.\n, \nMerrill et al., J. Urol. 163(2): 503-5120 (2000\n); \nPolascik et al., J. Urol, Aug; 162(2):293-306 (1999\n) and\n Fortier et al., J. Nat. Cancer Inst. 91(19): 1635-1640(1999\n)). A variety of other diagnostic markers are also used in similar contexts including p53 and K-ras (see, e.g., \nTulchinsky et al., Int J Mol Med 1999 Jul 4(1):99-102 \nand \nMinimoto et al., Cancer Detect \n). Therefore, this disclosure of PSCA polynucleotides and polypeptides (as well as PSCA polynucleotide probes and anti-PSCA antibodies used to identify the presence of these molecules) and their properties allows skilled artisans to utilize these molecules in methods that are analogous to those used, for example, in a variety of diagnostic assays directed to examining conditions associated with cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical embodiments of diagnostic methods which utilize the PSCA polynucleotides, polypeptides, reactive T cells and antibodies are analogous to those methods from well-established diagnostic assays, which employ, e.g., PSA polynucleotides, polypeptides, reactive T cells and antibodies. For example, just as PSA polynucleotides are used as probes (for example in Northern analysis, see, \ne.g.\n, \nSharief et al., Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 33(3):567-74(1994\n)) and primers (for example in PCR analysis, see, e.g., \nOkegawa et al., J. Urol. 163(4): 1189-1190 (2000\n)) to observe the presence and/or the level of PSA mRNAs in methods of monitoring PSA overexpression or the metastasis of prostate cancers, the PSCA polynucleotides described herein can be utilized in the same way to detect PSCA overexpression or the metastasis of prostate and other cancers expressing this gene. Alternatively, just as PSA polypeptides are used to generate antibodies specific for PSA which can then be used to observe the presence and/or the level of PSA proteins in methods to monitor PSA protein overexpression (sec, \ne.g.\n, \nStephan et al., Urology 55(4):560-3 (2000\n)) or the metastasis of prostate cells (see, \ne.g.\n, \nAlanen et al., Pathol. Res. Pract, 192(3):233-7 (1996\n)), the PSCA polypeptides described herein can be utilized to generate antibodies for use in detecting PSCA overexpression or the metastasis of prostate cells and cells of other cancers expressing this gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, because metastases involves the movement of cancer cells from an organ of origin (such as the lung or prostate gland etc.) to a different area of the body (such as a lymph node), assays which examine a biological sample for the presence of cells expressing PSCA polynucleotides and/or polypeptides can be used to provide evidence of metastasis. For example, when a biological sample from tissue that does not normally contain PSCA-expressing cells (lymph node) is found to contain PSCA-expressing cells such as the PSCA expression seen in LAPC4 and LAPC9, xenografts isolated from lymph node and bone metastasis, respectively, this finding is indicative of metastasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively PSCA polynucleotides and/or polypeptide can be used to provide evidence of cancer, for example, when cells in a biological sample that do not normally express PSCA or express PSCA at a different level are found to express PSCA or have an increased expression of PSCA (see, \ne.g.\n, the PSCA expression in the cancers listed in Table I and in patient samples etc. shown in the accompanying Figures). In such assays, artisans may further wish to generate supplementary evidence of metastasis by testing the biological sample for the presence of a second tissue restricted marker (in addition to PSCA) such as PSA, PSCA etc. (see, e.g., \nAlanen et al., Pathol. Res. Pract. 192(3): 233-237 (1996\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of immunohistochemistry to identify the presence of a PSCA polypeptide within a tissue section can indicate an altered state of certain cells within that tissue, It is well understood in the art that the ability of an antibody to localize to a polypeptide that is expressed in cancer cells is a way of diagnosing presence of disease, disease stage, progression and/or tumor aggressiveness. Such an antibody can also detect an altered distribution of the polypeptide within the cancer cells, as compared to corresponding non-malignant tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PSCA polypeptide and immunogenic compositions are also useful in view of the phenomena of altered subcellular protein localization in disease states. Alteration of cells from normal to diseased state causes changes in cellular morphology and is often associated with changes in subcellular protein localization/distribution. For example, cell membrane proteins that are expressed in a polarized manner in normal cells can be altered in disease, resulting in distribution of the protein in a non-polar manner over the whole cell surface,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phenomenon of altered subcellular protein localization in a disease state has been demonstrated with MUC1 and Her2 protein expression by use of immunohistochemical means. Normal epithelial cells have a typical apical distribution of MUC1, in addition to some supranuclear localization of the glycoprotein, whereas malignant lesions often demonstrate an apolar staining pattern (\nDiaz et al, The Breast Journal, 7; 40-45 (2401\n); \nZhang et al, Clinical Cancer Research, 4; 2669-2676 (1998\n): \nCao, et al, The Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry, 45: 1547-1557 (1997\n)). In addition, norman breast epithelium is either negative for Her2 protein or exhibits only a basolateral distribution whereas malignant cells can express the protein over the whole cell surface (\nDe Potter, et al, International Journal of Cancer, 44; 969-974 (1989\n): McCormick, et al, 117; 935-943 (2002)). Alternatively, distribution of the protein may be altered from a surface only localization to include diffuse cytoplasmic expression in the diseased state, Such an example can be seen with MUC1 (\nDiaz, et al, The Breast Journal, 7: 40-45 (2001\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlteration in the localization/distribution of a protein in the cell, as detected by immunohistochemical methods, can also provide valuable information concerning the favorability of certain treatment modalities. This last point is illustrated by a situation where a protein may be intracellular in normal tissue, but cell surface in malignant cells; the cell surface location makes the cells favorably amenable to antibody-based diagnostic and treatment regimens. When such an alteration of protein localization occurs for PSCA, the PSCA protein and immune responses related thereto are very useful. Accordingly, the ability to determine whether alteration of subcellular protein localization occurred for 24P4C12 make the PSCA protein and immune responses related thereto very useful. Use of the PSCA compositions allows those skilled in the art to make important diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunohistochemical reagents specific to PSCA are also useful to detect metastases of tumors expressing PSCA when the polypeptide appears in tissues where PSCA is not normally produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, PSCA polypeptides and antibodies resulting from immune responses thereto are useful in a variety of important contexts such as diagnostic, prognostic, preventative and/or therapeutic purposes known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nJust as PSA polynucleotide fragments and polynucleotide variants are employed by skilled artisans for use in methods of monitoring PSA, PSCA polynucleotide fragments and polynucleotide variants are used in an analogous manner. In particular, typical PSA polynucleotides used in methods of monitoring PSA are probes or primers which consist of fragments of the PSA cDNA sequence. Illustrating this, primers used to PCR amplify a PSA polynucleotide must include less than the whole PSA sequence to function in the polymerase chain reaction. In the context of such PCR reactions, skilled artisans generally create a variety of different polynucleotide fragments that can be used as primers in order to amplify different portions of a polynucleotide of interest or to optimize amplification reactions (see, \ne.g.\n, \nCaetano-Anolles, G. Biotechniques 25(3): 472-476, 478-480 (1998\n); \nRobertson et al., Methods Mol. Biol. 98:121-154 (1998\n)). An additional illustration of the use of such fragments is provided in the Example entitled \"Expression analysis of PSCA in normal tissues, and patient specimens,\" where a PSCA polynucleotide fragment is used as a probe to show the expression of PSCA RNAs in cancer cells. In addition, variant polynucleotide sequences are typically used as primers and probes for the corresponding mRNAs in PCR and Northern analyses (sec, \ne.g.\n, \nSawai et al., Fetal Diagn. Ther. 1996 Nov-Dec 11(6):407-13\n and \nCurrent Protocols In Molecular Biology, \n)). Polynucleotide fragments and variants are useful in this context where they are capable of binding to a target polynucleotide sequence (\ne.g.\n, a PSCA polynucleotide shown in \nFigure 1\n or variant thereof) under conditions of high stringency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, PSA polypeptides which contain an epitope that can be recognized by an antibody or T cell that specifically binds to that epitope are used in methods of monitoring PSA. PSCA polypeptide fragments and polypeptide analogs or variants can also be used in an analogous manner. This practice of using polypeptide fragments or polypeptide variants to generate antibodies (such as anti-PSA antibodies or T cells) is typical in the art with a wide variety of systems such as fusion proteins being used by practitioners (see, \ne.g.\n, \nCurrent Protocols In Molecular Biology, \n). In this context, each epitope(s) functions to provide the architecture with which an antibody or T cell is reactive. Typically, skilled artisans create a variety of different polypeptide fragments that can be used in order to generate immune responses specific for different portions of a polypeptide of interest (see, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,840,501\n \n and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,939,533\n \n). For example it may be preferable to utilize a polypeptide comprising one of the PSCA biological motifs discussed herein or a motif bearing subsequence which is readily identified by one of skill in the art based on motifs available in the art. Polypeptide fragments, variants or analogs are typically useful in this context as long as they comprise an epitope capable of generating an antibody or T cell specific for a target polypeptide sequence (\ne.g.\n a PSCA polypeptide shown in \nFigure 1\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown herein, the PSCA polynucleotides and polypeptides (as well as the PSCA polynucleotide probes and anti-PSCA antibodies or T cells used to identify the presence of these molecules) exhibit specific properties that make them useful in diagnosing cancers such as those listed in Table I. Diagnostic assays that measure the presence of PSCA gene products, in order to evaluate the presence or onset of a disease condition described herein, such as prostate cancer, are used to identify patients for preventive measures or further monitoring, as has been done so successfully with PSA. Moreover, these materials satisfy a need in the art for molecules having similar or complementary characteristics to PSA in situations where, for example, a definite diagnosis of metastasis of prostatic origin cannot be made on the basis of a test for PSA alone (see, \ne.g.\n, \nAlanen et al., Pathol, Res. Pract. 192(3): 233-237 (1996\n)), and consequently, materials such as PSCA polynucleotides and polypeptides (as well as the PSCA polynucleotide probes and anti-PSCA antibodies used to identify the presence of these molecules) need to be employed to confirm a metastases of prostatic origin,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, in addition to their use in diagnostic assays, the PSCA polynucleotides disclosed herein have a number of other utilities such as their use in the identification of oncogenetic associated chromosomal abnormalities in the chromosomal region to which the PSCA gene maps (see the Example entitled \"Chromosomal Mapping of PSCA\" below). Moreover, in addition to their use in diagnostic assays, the PSCA-related proteins and polynucleotides disclosed herein have other utilities such as their use in the forensic analysis of tissues of unknown origin (see, \ne.g.\n, \nTakahama K Forensic Sci Int 1996 \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, PSCA-related proteins or polynucleotides of the invention can be used to treat a pathologic condition characterized by the over-expression of PSCA. For example, the amino acid or nucleic acid sequence of \nFigure 1\n, or fragments of either, can be used to generate an immune response to a PSCA antigen. Antibodies or other molecules that react with PSCA can be used to modulate the function of this molecule, and thereby provide a therapeutic benefit.\n\n\n \nXIL) Inhibition of PSCA Protein Function\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention includes various methods and compositions for inhibiting the binding of PSCA to its binding partner or its association with other protein(s) as well as methods for inhibiting PSCA function,\n\n\n \nXII.A.) Inhibition of PSCA With Intracellular Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one approach, a recombinant vector that encodes single chain antibodies that specifically bind to PSCA are introduced into PSCA expressing cells via gene transfer technologies. Accordingly, the encoded single chain anti-PSCA antibody is expressed intracellularly, binds to PSCA protein, and thereby inhibits its function. Methods for engineering such intracellular single chain antibodies are well known. Such intracellular antibodies, also known as \"intrabodies\", are specifically targeted to a particular compartment within the cell, providing control over where the inhibitory activity of the treatment is focused. This technology has been successfully applied in the art (for review, see \nRichardson and Marasco, 1995, TIBTECH vol. 13\n). Intrabodies have been shown to virtually eliminate the expression of otherwise abundant cell surface receptors (see, \ne.g.\n, \nRichardson et al., 1995, Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92: 3137-3141\n; \nBeerli et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 289: 23931-23936\n; \nDeshane et al., 1994, Gene Ther. 1: 332-337\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle chain antibodies comprise the variable domains of the heavy and light chain joined by a flexible linker polypeptide, and are expressed as a single polypeptide. Optionally, single chain antibodies are expressed as a single chain variable region fragment joined to the light chain constant region. Well-known intracellular trafficking signals are engineered into recombinant polynucleotide vectors encoding such single chain antibodies in order to target precisely the intrabody to the desired intracellular compartment. For example, intrabodies targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are engineered to incorporate a leader peptide and, optionally, a C-terminal ER retention signal, such as the KDEL amino acid motif Intrabodies intended to exert activity in the nucleus are engineered to include a nuclear localization signal. Lipid moieties are joined to intrabodies in order to tether the intrabody to the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane. Intrabodies can also be targeted to exert function in the cytosol. For example, cytosolic intrabodies are used to sequester factors within the cytosol, thereby preventing them from being transported to their natural cellular destination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, intrabodies are used to capture PSCA in the nucleus, thereby preventing its activity within the nucleus. Nuclear targeting signals are engineered into such PSCA intrabodies in order to achieve the desired targeting. Such PSCA intrabodies are designed to bind specifically to a particular PSCA domain. In another embodiment, cytosolic intrabodies that specifically bind to a PSCA protein are used to prevent PSCA from gaining access to the nucleus, thereby preventing it from exerting any biological activity within the nucleus (\ne.g.\n, preventing PSCA from forming transcription complexes with other factors),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to specifically direct the expression of such intrabodies to particular cells, the transcription of the intrabody is placed under the regulatory control of an appropriate tumor-specific promoter and/or enhancer. In order to target intrabody expression specifically to prostate, for example, the PSA promoter and/or promoter/enhancer can be utilized (See, for example, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,919,G52 issued 6 July 1999\n \n).\n\n\n \nXII.B.) Inhibition of PSCA with Recombinant Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another approach, recombinant molecules bind to PSCA and thereby inhibit PSCA function. For example, these recombinant molecules prevent or inhibit PSCA from accessing/binding to its binding partner(s) or associating with other protein(s). Such recombinant molecules can, for example, contain the reactive part(s) of a PSCA specific antibody molecule. In a particular embodiment, the PSCA binding domain of a PSCA binding partner is engineered into a dimeric fusion protein, whereby the fusion protein comprises two PSCA ligand binding domains linked to the Fc portion of a human IgG, such as human IgGi. Such IgG portion can contain, for example, the CH\n2\n and CH\n3\n domains and the hinge region, but not the CH\n1\n domain. Such dimeric fusion proteins are administered in soluble form to patients suffering from a cancer associated with the expression of PSCA, whereby the dimeric fusion protein specifically binds to PSCA and blocks PSCA interaction with a binding partner. Such dimeric fusion proteins are further combined into multimeric proteins using known antibody linking technologies.\n\n\n \nXILC.)Inhibition of PSCA Transcription or Translation\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also comprises various methods and compositions for inhibiting the transcription of the PSCA gene. Similarly, the invention also provides methods and compositions for inhibiting the translation af PSCA mRNA into protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one approach, a method of inhibiting the transcription of the PSCA gene comprises contacting the PSCA gene with a PSCA antisense polynucleotide. In another approach, a method of inhibiting PSCA mRNA translation comprises contacting a PSCA mRNA with an antisense polynucleotide. In another approach, a PSCA specific ribozyme is used to cleave a PSCA message, thereby inhibiting translation. Such antisense and ribozyme based methods can also be directed to the regulatory regions of the PSCA gene, such as PSCA promoter and/or enhancer elements. Similarly, proteins capable of inhibiting a PSCA gene transcription factor are used to inhibit PSCA mRNA transcription. The various polynucleotides and compositions useful in the aforementioned methods have been described above. The use of antisense and ribozyme molecules to inhibit transcription and translation is well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther factors that inhibit the transcription of PSCA by interfering with PSCA transcriptional activation are also useful to treat cancers expressing PSCA. Similarly, factors that interfere with PSCA processing are useful to treat cancers that express PSCA. Cancer treatment methods utilizing such factors are also within the scope of the invention,\n\n\n \nXILD.)General Considerations for Therapeutic Strategies\n\n\n \n \n \nGene transfer and gene therapy technologies can be used to deliver therapeutic polynucleotide molecules to tumor cells synthesizing PSCA (\ni.e.\n, antisense, ribozyme, polynucleotides encoding intrabodies and other PSCA inhibitory molecules). A number of gene therapy approaches are known in the art. Recombinant vectors encoding PSCA antisense polynucleotides, ribozymes, factors capable of interfering with PSCA transcription, and so forth, can be delivered to target tumor cells using such gene therapy approaches.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above therapeutic approaches can be combined with any one of a wide variety of surgical, chemotherapy or radiation therapy regimens. The therapeutic approaches of the invention can enable the use of reduced dosages of chemotherapy (or other therapies) and/or less frequent administration, an advantage for all patients and particularly for those that do not tolerate the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-tumor activity of a particular composition (\ne.g.\n, antisense, ribozyme, intrabody), or a combination of such compositions, can be evaluated using various \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n assay systems. \nIn vitro\n assays that evaluate therapeutic activity include cell growth assays, soft agar assays and other assays indicative of tumor promoting activity, binding assays capable of determining the extent to which a therapeutic composition will inhibit the binding of PSCA to a binding partner, etc,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIn vivo\n, the effect of a PSCA therapeutic composition can be evaluated in a suitable animal model. For example, xenogenic prostate cancer models can be used, wherein human prostate cancer explants or passaged xenograft tissues are introduced into immune compromised animals, such as nude or SCID mice (\nKlein et al., 1997, \n). For example, \n \nPCT Patent Application WO98/1662\n \n and \n \nU.S. Patent 6,107,540\n \n describe various xenograft models of human prostate cancer capable of recapitulating the development of primary tumors, micrometastasis, and the formation of osteoblastic metastases characteristic of late stage disease. Efficacy can be predicted using assays that measure inhibition of tumor formation, tumor regression or metastasis, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIn vivo\n assays that evaluate the promotion of apoptosis are useful in evaluating therapeutic compositions. In one embodiment, xenografts from tumor bearing mice treated with the therapeutic composition can be examined for the presence of apoptotic foci and compared to untreated control xenograft-bearing mice. The extent to which apoptotic foci are found in the tumors of the treated mice provides an indication of the therapeutic efficacy of the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic compositions used in the practice of the foregoing methods can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions comprising a carrier suitable for the desired delivery method. Suitable carriers include any material that when combined with the therapeutic composition retains the anti-tumor function of the therapeutic composition and is generally nonreactive with the patient's immune system. Examples include, but are not limited to, any of a number of standard pharmaceutical carriers such as sterile phosphate buffered saline solutions, bacteriostatic water, and the like (see, generally, \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th Edition, A. Osal., Ed., 1980\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic formulations can be solubilized and administered via any route capable of delivering the therapeutic composition to the tumor site. Potentially effective routes of administration include, but are not limited to, intravenous, parenteral, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intratumor, intradermal, intraorgan, orthotopic, and the like. A preferred formulation for intravenous injection comprises the therapeutic composition in a solution of preserved bacteriostatic water, sterile unpreserved water, and/or diluted in polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags containing 0.9% sterile Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP. Therapeutic protein preparations can be lyophilized and stored as sterile powders, preferably under vacuum, and then reconstituted in bacteriostatic water (containing for example, benzyl alcohol preservative) or in sterile water prior to injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosages and administration protocols for the treatment of cancers using the foregoing methods will vary with the method and the target cancer, and will generally depend on a number of other factors appreciated in the art.\n\n\n \nXIII.) Identification, Characterization and Use of Modulators of PSCA\n\n\n\n\nMethods to Identify and Use Modulators\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, screening is performed to identify modulators that induce or suppress a particular expression profile, suppress or induce specific pathways, preferably generating the associated phenotype thereby. In another embodiment, having identified differentially expressed genes important in a particular state; screens are performed to identify modulators that alter expression of individual genes, either increase or decrease. In another embodiment, screening is performed to identify modulators that alter a biological function of the expression product of a differentially expressed gene. Again, having identified the importance of a gene in a particular state, screens are performed to identify agents that bind and/or modulate the biological activity of the gene product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, screens are done for genes that are induced in response to a candidate agent. After identifying a modulator (one that suppresses a cancer expression pattern leading to a normal expression pattern, or a modulator of a cancer gene that leads to expression of the gene as in normal tissue) a screen is performed to identify genes that are specifically modulated in response to the agent. Comparing expression profiles between normal tissue and agent-treated cancer tissue reveals genes that are not expressed in normal tissue or cancer tissue, but are expressed in agent treated tissue, and vice versa. These agent-specific sequences are identified and used by methods described herein for cancer genes or proteins. In particular these sequences and the proteins they encode are used in marking or identifying agent-treated cells. In addition, antibodies are raised against the agent-induced proteins and used to target novel therapeutics to the treated cancer tissue sample.\n\n\n \n\n\nModulator-related Identification and Screening Assays:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGene Expression-related Assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nProteins, nucleic acids, and antibodies of the invention are used in screening assays. The cancer-associated proteins, antibodies, nucleic acids, modified proteins and cells containing these sequences are used in screening assays, such as evaluating the effect of drug candidates on a \"gene expression profile,\" expression profile of polypeptides or alteration of biological function. In one embodiment, the expression profiles are used, preferably in conjunction with high throughput screening techniques to allow monitoring for expression profile genes after treatment with a candidate agent (e.g., \nDavis, GF, et al, J Biol Screen 7:69 (2002\n); \nZlokarnik, et al., Science 279:84-8 (1998\n); \nHeid, Genome Res 6:986-94,1996\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cancer proteins, antibodies, nucleic acids, modified proteins and cells containing the native or modified cancer proteins or genes are used in screening assays. That is, the present invention comprises methods for screening for compositions which modulate the cancer phenotype or a physiological function of a cancer protein of the invention. This is done on a gene itself or by evaluating the effect of drug candidates on a \"gene expression profile\" or biological function, In one embodiment, expression profiles are used, preferably in conjunction with high throughput screening techniques to allow monitoring after treatment with a candidate agent, see Zlokamik, \nsupra.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of assays are executed directed to the genes and proteins of the invention, Assays are run on an individual nucleic acid or protein level. That is, having identified a particular gene as up regulated in cancer, test compounds are screened for the ability to modulate gene expression or for binding to the cancer protein of the invention, \"Modulation\" in this context includes an increase or a decrease in gene expression. The preferred amount of modulation will depend on the original change of the gene expression in normal versus tissue undergoing cancer, with changes of at least 10%, preferably 50%, more preferably 100-300%, and in some embodiments 300-1000% or greater. Thus, if a gene exhibits a 4-fold increase in cancer tissue compared to normal tissue, a decrease of about four-fold is often desired; similarly, a 10-fold decrease in cancer tissue compared to normal tissue a target value of a 10-fold increase in expression by the test compound is often desired, Modulators that exacerbate the type of gene expression seen in cancer are also useful, \ne.g.\n, as an upregulated target in further analyses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of gene expression is monitored using nucleic acid probes and the quantification of gene expression levels, or, alternatively, a gene product itself is monitored, \ne.g.\n, through the use of antibodies to the cancer protein and standard immunoassays, Proteomics and separation techniques also allow for quantification of expression.\n\n\n \n\n\nExpression Monitoring to Identify Compounds that Modify Gene Expression\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, gene expression monitoring, \ni.e.\n, an expression profile, is monitored simultaneously for a number of entities. Such profiles will typically involve one or more of the genes of \nFigure 1\n. In this embodiment, \ne.g.\n, cancer nucleic acid probes are attached to biochips to detect and quantify cancer sequences in a particular cell. Alternatively, PCR can be used. Thus, a series, \ne.g.\n, wells of a microtiter plate, can be used with dispensed primers in desired wells. A PCR reaction can then be performed and analyzed for each well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression monitoring is performed to identify compounds that modify the expression of one or more cancer-associated sequences, \ne.g.\n, a polynucleotide sequence set out in \nFigure 1\n. Generally, a test modulator is added to the cells prior to analysis. Moreover, screens are also provided to identify agents that modulate cancer, modulate cancer proteins of the invention, bind to a cancer protein of the invention, or interfere with the binding of a cancer protein of the invention and an antibody or other binding partner,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, high throughput screening methods involve providing a library containing a large number of potential therapeutic compounds (candidate compounds). Such \"combinatorial chemical libraries\" are then screened in one or more assays to identify those library members (particular chemical species or subclasses) that display a desired characteristic activity, The compounds thus identified can serve as conventional \"lead compounds,\" as compounds for screening, or as therapeutics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, combinatorial libraries of potential modulators are screened for an ability to bind to a cancer polypeptide or to modulate activity. Conventionally, new chemical entities with useful properties are generated by identifying a chemical compound (called a \"lead compound\") with some desirable property or activity, \ne.g.\n, inhibiting activity, creating variants of the lead compound, and evaluating the property and activity of those variant compounds. Often, high throughput screening (HTS) methods are employed for such an analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, gene expression monitoring is conveniently used to test candidate modulators (\ne.g.\n, protein, nucleic acid or small molecule). After the candidate agent has been added and the cells allowed to incubate for a period, the sample containing a target sequence to be analyzed is, \ne.g.\n, added to a biochip.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf required, the target sequence is prepared using known techniques. For example, a sample is treated to lyse the cells, using known lysis buffers, electroporation, etc., with purification and/or amplification such as PCR performed as appropriate. For example, an \nin vitro\n transcription with labels covalently attached to the nucleotides is performed. Generally, the nucleic acids are labeled with biotin-FITC or PE, or with cy3 or cy5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe target sequence can be labeled with, \ne.g.\n, a fluorescent, a chemiluminescent, a chemical, or a radioactive signal, to provide a means of detecting the target sequence's specific binding to a probe. The label also can be an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase, which when provided with an appropriate substrate produces a product that is detected. Alternatively, the label is a labeled compound or small molecule, such as an enzyme inhibitor, that binds but is not catalyzed or altered by the enzyme. The label also can be a moiety or compound, such as, an epitope tag or biotin which specifically binds to streptavidin. For the example of biotin, the streptavidin is labeled as described above, thereby, providing a detectable signal for the bound target sequence. Unbound labeled streptavidin is typically removed prior to analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be appreciated by those in the art, these assays can be direct hybridization assays or can comprise \"sandwich assays\", which include the use of multiple probes, as is generally outlined in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5, 681,702\n \n; \n \n5,597,909\n \n; \n \n5,545,730\n \n; \n \n5,594,117\n \n; \n \n5,591,584\n \n; \n \n5,571,670\n \n;\n \n 5,580,731\n \n; \n \n5,571,670\n \n; \n \n5,591,584\n \n;\n \n 5,624,802\n \n; \n \n5,635,352\n \n; \n \n5,594,118\n \n; \n \n5,359,100\n \n; \n \n5,124, 246\n \n; and \n \n5,581,697\n \n. In this embodiment, in general, the target nucleic acid is prepared as outlined above, and then added to the biochip comprising a plurality of nucleic acid probes, under conditions that allow the formation of a hybridization complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of hybridization conditions are used in the present invention, including high, moderate and low stringency conditions as outlined above. The assays are generally run under stringency conditions which allow formation of the label probe hybridization complex only in the presence of target. Stringency can be controlled by altering a step parameter that is a thermodynamic variable, including, but not limited to, temperature, formamide concentration, salt concentration, chaotropic salt concentration pH, organic solvent concentration, etc. These parameters may also be used to control non-specific binding, as is generally outlined in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,681,697\n \n. Thus, it can be desirable to perform certain steps at higher stringency conditions to reduce non-specific binding,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reactions outlined herein can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Components of the reaction can be added simultaneously, or sequentially, in different orders, with preferred embodiments outlined below. In addition, the reaction may include a variety of other reagents. These include salts, buffers, neutral proteins, \ne.g.\n albumin, detergents, etc, which can be used to facilitate optimal hybridization and detection, and/or reduce nonspecific or background interactions. Reagents that otherwise improve the efficiency of the assay, such as protease inhibitors, nuclease inhibitors, anti-microbial agents, etc., may also be used as appropriate, depending on the sample preparation methods and purity of the target. The assay data are analyzed to determine the expression levels of individual genes, and changes in expression levels as between states, forming a gene expression profile.\n\n\n \n\n\nBiological Activity-related Assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides methods identify or screen for a compound that modulates the activity of a cancer-related gene or protein of the invention. The methods comprise adding a test compound, as defined above, to a cell comprising a cancer protein of the invention. The cells contain a recombinant nucleic acid that encodes a cancer protein of the invention. In another embodiment, a library of candidate agents is tested on a plurality of cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the assays are evaluated in the presence or absence or previous or subsequent exposure of physiological signals, \ne.g.\n hormones, antibodies, peptides, antigens, cytokines, growth factors, action potentials, pharmacological agents including chemotherapeutics, radiation, carcinogenics, or other cells (\ni.e.\n, cell-cell contacts). In another example, the determinations are made at different stages of the cell cycle process. In this way, compounds that modulate genes or proteins of the invention are identified. Compounds with pharmacological activity are able to enhance or interfere with the activity of the cancer protein of the invention. Once identified, similar structures are evaluated to identify critical structural features of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a method of modulating (\ne.g.\n, inhibiting) cancer cell division is provided; the method comprises administration of a cancer modulator. In another embodiment, a method of modulating (\ne.g.\n, inhibiting) cancer is provided; the method comprises administration of a cancer modulator. In a further embodiment, methods of treating cells or individuals with cancer are provided; the method comprises administration of a cancer modulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a method for modulating the status of a cell that expresses a gene of the invention is provided. As used herein status comprises such art-accepted parameters such as growth, proliferation, survival, function, apoptosis, senescence, location, enzymatic activity, signal transduction, etc, of a cell. In one embodiment, a cancer inhibitor is an antibody as discussed above. In another embodiment, the cancer inhibitor is an antisense molecule. A variety of cell growth, proliferation, and metastasis assays are known to those of skill in the art, as described herein.\n\n\n \n\n\nHigh Throughput Screening to Identify Modulators\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe assays to identify suitable modulators are amenable to high throughput screening. Preferred assays thus detect enhancement or inhibition of cancer gene transcription, inhibition or enhancement of polypeptide expression, and inhibition or enhancement of polypeptide activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, modulators evaluated in high throughput screening methods are proteins, often naturally occurring proteins or fragments of naturally occurring proteins. Thus, e.g., cellular extracts containing proteins, or random or directed digests of proteinaceous cellular extracts, are used. In this way, libraries of proteins are made for screening in the methods of the invention. Particularly preferred in this embodiment are libraries of bacterial, fungal, viral, and mammalian proteins, with the latter being preferred, and human proteins being especially preferred. Particularly useful test compound will be directed to the class of proteins to which the target belongs, \ne.g.\n, substrates for enzymes, or ligands and receptors.\n\n\n \n\n\nUse of Soft Agar Growth and Colony Formation to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nNormal cells require a solid substrate to attach and grow. When cells are transformed, they lose this phenotype and grow detached from the substrate. For example, transformed cells can grow in stirred suspension culture or suspended in semi-solid media, such as semi-solid or soft agar. The transformed cells, when transfected with tumor suppressor genes, can regenerate normal phenotype and once again require a solid substrate to attach to and grow, Soft agar growth or colony formation in assays are used to identify modulators of cancer sequences, which when expressed in host cells, inhibit abnormal cellular proliferation and transformation. A modulator reduces or eliminates the host cells' ability to grow suspended in solid or semisolid media, such as agar.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechniques for soft agar growth or colony formation in suspension assays are described in \nFreshney, Culture of Animal Cells a Manual of Basic Technique (3rd ed., 1994\n). See also, the methods section of Garkavtsev \net al.\n (1996), \nsupra\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nEvaluation of Contact Inhibition and Growth Density Limitation to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nNormal cells typically grow in a flat and organized pattern in cell culture until they touch other cells. When the cells touch one another, they are contact inhibited and stop growing. Transformed cells, however, are not contact inhibited and continue to grow to high densities in disorganized foci. Thus, transformed cells grow to a higher saturation density than corresponding normal cells. This is detected morphologically by the formation of a disoriented monolayer of cells or cells in foci. Alternatively, labeling index with (\n3\nH)-thymidine at saturation density is used to measure density limitation of growth, similarly an MTT or Alamar blue assay will reveal proliferation capacity of cells and the ability of modulators to affect same. See Freshney (1994), \nsupra\n. Transformed cells, when transfected with tumor suppressor genes, can regenerate a normal phenotype and become contact inhibited and would grow to a lower density.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this assay, labeling index with 3H)-thymidine at saturation density is a preferred method of measuring density limitation of growth. Transformed host cells are transfected with a cancer-associated sequence and are grown for 24 hours at saturation density in non-limiting medium conditions. The percentage of cells labeling with (\n3\nH)-thymidine is determined by incorporated cpm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nContact independent growth is used to identify modulators of cancer sequences, which had led to abnormal cellular proliferation and transformation. A modulator reduces or eliminates contact independent growth, and returns the cells to a normal phenotype.\n\n\n \n\n\nEvaluation of Growth Factor or Serum Dependence to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTransformed cells have lower serum dependence than their normal counterparts (see, e.g., \nTemin, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 37:167-175 (1966\n); \nEagle et al., J. Exp. Med 131:836-879 (1970\n)); Freshney, \nsupra.\n This is in part due to release of various growth factors by the transformed cells, The degree of growth factor or serum dependence of transformed host cells can be compared with that of control. For example, growth factor or serum dependence of a cell is monitored in methods to identify and characterize compounds that modulate cancer-associated sequences of the invention.\n\n\n \n\n\nUse of Tumor-specific Marker Levels to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTumor cells release an increased amount of certain factors (hereinafter \"tumor specific markers\") than their normal counterparts. For example, plasminogen activator (PA) is released from human glioma at a higher level than from normal brain cells (see, \ne.g.\n, \nGullino, Angiogenesis, Tumor Vascularization, and Potential Interference with Tumor Growth, in Biological Responses in Cancer, pp. 178-184 (Mihich (ed.) 1985\n)). Similarly, Tumor Angiogenesis Factor (TAF) is released at a higher level in tumor cells than their normal counterparts. See, \ne.g.\n, \nFolkman, Angiogenesis and Cancer, Sem. Cancer Biol. (1992\n)), while bFGF is released from endothelial tumors (Ensoli, B \net al.\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques which measure the release of these factors are described in Freshney (1994), \nsupra.\n Also, see, \nUnkless et al., J. Biol. Chem. 249:4295-4305 (1974\n); \nStrickland & Beers, J. Biol. Chem. 251:5694-5702 (1976\n); \nWhur et al., Br. J. Cancer 42:305 312 (1980\n); \nGullino, Angiogenesis, Tumor Vascularization, and Potential Interference with Tumor Growth, in Biological Responses in Cancer, pp, 178-184 (Mihich (ed.) 1985\n); \nFreshney, Anticancer Res. 5:111-130 (1985\n). For example, tumor specific marker levels are monitored in methods to identify and characterize compounds that modulate cancer-associated sequences of the invention.\n\n\n \n\n\nInvasiveness into Matrigel to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe degree of invasiveness into Matrigel or an extracellular matrix constituent can be used as an assay to identify and characterize compounds that modulate cancer associated sequences. Tumor cells exhibit a positive correlation between malignancy and invasiveness of cells into Matrigel or some other extracellular matrix constituent. In this assay, tumorigenic cells are typically used as host cells. Expression of a tumor suppressor gene in these host cells would decrease invasiveness of the host cells. Techniques described in \nCancer Res. 1999; 59:6010\n; Freshney (1994), \nsupra\n, can be used. Briefly, the level of invasion of host cells is measured by using filters coated with Matrigel or some other extracellular matrix constituent. Penetration into the gel, or through to the distal side of the filter, is rated as invasiveness, and rated histologically by number of cells and distance moved, or by prelabeling the cells with \n125\nI and counting the radioactivity on the distal side of the filter or bottom of the dish. See, \ne.g.\n, Freshney (1984), \nsupra.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEvaluation of Tumor Growth In \nVivo\n to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEffects of cancer-associated sequences on cell growth are tested in transgenic or immune-suppressed organisms. Transgenic organisms are prepared in a variety of art-accepted ways. For example, knock-out transgenic organisms, \ne.g.\n, mammals such as mice, are made, in which a cancer gene is disrupted or in which a cancer gene is inserted. Knock-out transgenic mice are made by insertion of a marker gene or other heterologous gene into the endogenous cancer gene site in the mouse genome via homologous recombination. Such mice can also be made by substituting the endogenous cancer gene with a mutated version of the cancer gene, or by mutating the endogenous cancer gene, \ne.g.\n, by exposure to carcinogens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo prepare transgenic chimeric animals, \ne.g.\n, mice, a DNA construct is introduced into the nuclei of embryonic stem cells. Cells containing the newly engineered genetic lesion are injected into a host mouse embryo, which is re-implanted into a recipient female. Some of these embryos develop into chimeric mice that possess germ cells some of which are derived from the mutant cell line. Therefore, by breeding the chimeric mice it is possible to obtain a new line of mice containing the introduced genetic lesion (see, \ne.g.\n, \nCapecchi et al., Science 244:1288 (1989\n)). Chimeric mice can be derived according to \n \nUS Patent 6,365,797, issued 2 April 2002\n \n; \n \nUS Patent 6,107,540 issued 22 August 2000\n \n; \nHogan et al., Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (1988\n) and \nTeratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach, Robertson, ed., IRL Press, Washington, D.C., (1987\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, various immune-suppressed or immune-deficient host animals can be used. For example, a genetically athymia \"nude\" mouse (see, \ne.g.\n, \nGiovanella et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 52:921 (1974\n)), a SCID mouse, a thymectornized mouse, or an irradiated mouse (see, \ne.g.\n, \nBradley et al., Br. J. Cancer 38:263 (1978\n); \nSelby et al., Br. J. Cancer 41:52 (1980\n)) can be used as a host. Transplantable tumor cells (typically about 10\n6\n cells) injected into isogenic hosts produce invasive tumors in a high proportion of cases, while normal cells of similar origin will not. In hosts which developed invasive tumors, cells expressing cancer-associated sequences are injected subcutaneously or orthotopically. Mice are then separated into groups, including control groups and treated experimental groups) \ne.g.\n treated with a modulator). After a suitable length of time, preferably 4-8 weeks, tumor growth is measured (\ne.g.\n, by volume or by its two largest dimensions, or weight) and compared to the control. Tumors that have statistically significant reduction (using, \ne.g.\n, Student's T test) are said to have inhibited growth.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn Vitro Assays to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAssays to identify compounds with modulating activity can be performed \nin vitro.\n For example, a cancer polypeptide is first contacted with a potential modulator and incubated for a suitable amount of time, \ne.g.\n, from 0.5 to 48 hours. In one embodiment, the cancer polypeptide levels are determined \nin vitro\n by measuring the level of protein or mRNA. The level of protein is measured using immunoassays such as Western blotting, ELISA and the like with an antibody that selectively binds to the cancer polypeptide or a fragment thereof. For measurement of mRNA, amplification, \ne.g.\n, using PCR, LCR, or hybridization assays, e. g., Northern hybridization, RNAse protection, dot blotting, are preferred. The level of protein or mRNA is detected using directly or indirectly labeled detection agents, \ne.g.\n, fluorescently or radioactively labeled nucleic acids, radioactively or enzymatically labeled antibodies, and the like, as described herein,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a reporter gene system can be devised using a cancer protein promoter operably linked to a reporter gene such as luciferase, green fluorescent protein, CAT, or P-gal. The reporter construct is typically transfected into a cell. After treatment with a potential modulator, the amount of reporter gene transcription, translation, or activity is measured according to standard techniques known to those of skill in the art (Davis GF, \nsupra\n; \nGonzalez, J. & Negulescu, P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998: 9:624\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs outlined above, \nin vitro\n screens are done on individual genes and gene products. That is, having identified a particular differentially expressed gene as important in a particular state, screening of modulators of the expression of the gene or the gene product itself is performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, screening for modulators of expression of specific gene(s) is performed. Typically, the expression of only one or a few genes is evaluated. In another embodiment, screens are designed to first find compounds that bind to differentially expressed proteins. These compounds are then evaluated for the ability to modulate differentially expressed activity. Moreover, once initial candidate compounds are identified, variants can be further screened to better evaluate structure activity relationships.\n\n\n \n\n\nBinding Assays to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn binding assays in accordance with the invention, a purified or isolated gene product of the invention is generally used. For example, antibodies are generated to a protein of the invention, and immunoassays are run to determine the amount and/or location of protein. Alternatively, cells comprising the cancer proteins are used in the assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the methods comprise combining a cancer protein of the invention and a candidate compound such as a ligand, and determining the binding of the compound to the cancer protein of the invention. Preferred embodiments utilize the human cancer protein; animal models of human disease of can also be developed and used. Also, other analogous mammalian proteins also can be used as appreciated by those of skill in the art. Moreover, in some embodiments variant or derivative cancer proteins are used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the cancer protein of the invention, or the ligand, is non-diffusibly bound to an insoluble support. The support can, \ne.g.\n, be one having isolated sample receiving areas (a microtiter plate, an array, etc.). The insoluble supports can be made of any composition to which the compositions can be bound, is readily separated from soluble material, and is otherwise compatible with the overall method of screening. The surface of such supports can be solid or porous and of any convenient shape.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable insoluble supports include microtiter plates, arrays, membranes and beads. These are typically made of glass, plastic (\ne.g.\n, polystyrene), polysaccharide, nylon, nitrocellulose, or Teflon, etc. Microtiter plates and arrays are especially convenient because a large number of assays can be carried out simultaneously, using small amounts of reagents and samples. The particular manner of binding of the composition to the support is not crucial so long as it is compatible with the reagents and overall methods of the invention, maintains the activity of the composition and is nondiffusable. Preferred methods of binding include the use of antibodies which do not sterically block either the ligand binding site or activation sequence when attaching the protein to the support, direct binding to \"sticky\" or ionic supports, chemical crosslinking, the synthesis of the protein or agent on the surface, etc. Following binding of the protein or ligand/binding agent to the support, excess unbound material is removed by washing. The sample receiving areas may then be blocked through incubation with bovine serum albumin (BSA), casein or other innocuous protein or other moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce a cancer protein of the invention is bound to the support, and a test compound is added to the assay. Alternatively, the candidate binding agent is bound to the support and the cancer protein of the invention is then added. Binding agents include specific antibodies, non-natural binding agents identified in screens of chemical libraries, peptide analogs, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf particular interest are assays to identify agents that have a low toxicity for human cells. A wide variety of assays can be used for this purpose, including proliferation assays, cAMP assays, labeled \nin vitro\n protein-protein binding assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, immunoassays for protein binding, functional assays (phosphorylation assays, etc.) and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA determination of binding of the test compound (ligand, binding agent, modulator, etc.) to a cancer protein of the invention can be done in a number of ways. The test compound can be labeled, and binding determined directly, \ne.g.\n, by attaching all or a portion of the cancer protein of the invention to a solid support, adding a labeled candidate compound (\ne.g.\n, a fluorescent label), washing off excess reagent, and determining whether the label is present on the solid support. Various blocking and washing steps can be utilized as appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, only one of the components is labeled, \ne.g.\n, a protein of the invention or ligands labeled. Alternatively, more than one component is labeled with different labels, \ne.g.\n, I\n125\n, for the proteins and a fluorophor for the compound. Proximity reagents, \ne.g.\n, quenching or energy transfer reagents are also useful.\n\n\n \n\n\nCompetitive Binding to Identify and Characterize Modulators\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the binding of the \"test compound\" is determined by competitive binding assay with a \"competitor.\" The competitor is a binding moiety that binds to the target molecule (\ne.g.\n, a cancer protein of the invention). Competitors include compounds such as antibodies, peptides, binding partners, ligands, etc. Under certain circumstances, the competitive binding between the test compound and the competitor displaces the test compound. In one embodiment, the test compound is labeled. Either the test compound, the competitor, or both, is added to the protein for a time sufficient to allow binding. Incubations are performed at a temperature that facilitates optimal activity, typically between four and 40°C. Incubation periods are typically optimized, \ne.g.\n, to facilitate rapid high throughput screening; typically between zero and one hour will be sufficient. Excess reagent is generally removed or washed away. The second component is then added, and the presence or absence of the labeled component is followed, to indicate binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the competitor is added first, followed by the test compound. Displacement of the competitor is an indication that the test compound is binding to the cancer protein and thus is capable of binding to, and potentially modulating, the activity of the cancer protein. In this embodiment, either component can be labeled. Thus, \ne.g.\n, if the competitor is labeled, the presence of label in the post-test compound wash solution indicates displacement by the test compound. Alternatively, if the test compound is labeled, the presence of the label on the support indicates displacement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative embodiment, the test compound is added first, with incubation and washing, followed by the competitor. The absence of binding by the competitor indicates that the test compound binds to the cancer protein with higher affinity than the competitor. Thus, if the test compound is labeled, the presence of the label on the support, coupled with a lack of competitor binding, indicates that the test compound binds to and thus potentially modulates the cancer protein of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the competitive binding methods comprise differential screening to identity agents that are capable of modulating the activity of the cancer proteins of the invention. In this embodiment, the methods comprise combining a cancer protein and a competitor in a first sample. A second sample comprises a test compound, the cancer protein, and a competitor. The binding of the competitor is determined for both samples, and a change, or difference in binding between the two samples indicates the presence of an agent capable of binding to the cancer protein and potentially modulating its activity. That is, if the binding of the competitor is different in the second sample relative to the first sample, the agent is capable of binding to the cancer protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, differential screening is used to identify drug candidates that bind to the native cancer protein, but cannot bind to modified cancer proteins. For example the structure of the cancer protein is modeled and used in rational drug design to synthesize agents that interact with that site, agents which generally do not bind to site-modified proteins. Moreover, such drug candidates that affect the activity of a native cancer protein are also identified by screening drugs for the ability to either enhance or reduce the activity of such proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPositive controls and negative controls can be used in the assays. Preferably control and test samples are performed in at least triplicate to obtain statistically significant results. Incubation of all samples occurs for a time sufficient to allow for the binding of the agent to the protein. Following incubation, samples are washed free of non-specifically bound material and the amount of bound, generally labeled agent determine. For example, where a radiolabel is employed, the samples can be counted in a scintillation counter to determine the amount of bound compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of other reagents can be included in the screening assays. These include reagents like salts, neutral proteins, \ne.g.\n albumin, detergents, etc. which are used to facilitate optimal protein-protein binding and/or reduce non-specific or background interactions. Also reagents that otherwise improve the efficiency of the assay, such as protease inhibitors, nuclease inhibitors, atiti-microbial agents, etc., can be used. The mixture of components is added in an order that provides for the requisite binding.\n\n\n \n\n\nUse of Polynucleotides to Down-regulate or Inhibit a Protein of the Invention.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPolynucleotide modulators of cancer can be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleotide sequence by formation of a conjugate with a ligand-binding molecule, as described in \n \nWO 91/04753\n \n. Suitable ligand-binding molecules include, but are not limited to, cell surface receptors, growth factors, other cytokines, or other ligands that bind to cell surface receptors. Preferably, conjugation of the ligand binding molecule does not substantially interfere with the ability of the ligand binding molecule to bind to its corresponding molecule or receptor, or block entry of the sense or antisense oligonucleotide or its conjugated version into the cell. Alternatively, a polynucleotide modulator of cancer can be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence, \ne.g.\n, by formation of a polynucleotide-lipid complex, as described in \n \nWO 90110448\n \n. It is understood that the use of antisense molecules or knock out and knock in models may also be used in screening assays as discussed above, in addition to methods of treatment.\n\n\n \n\n\nInhibitory and Antisense Nucleotides\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the activity of a cancer-associated protein is down-regulated, or entirely inhibited, by the use of antisense polynucleotide or inhibitory small nuclear RNA (snRNA), \ni.e.\n, a nucleic acid complementary to, and which can preferably hybridize specifically to, a coding mRNA nucleic acid sequence, \ne.g.\n, a cancer protein of the invention, mRNA, or a subsequence thereof. Binding of the antisense polynucleotide to the mRNA reduces the translation and/or stability of the mRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the context of this invention, antisense polynucleotides can comprise naturally occurring nucleotides, or synthetic species formed from naturally occurring subunits or their close homologs. Antisense polynucleotides may also have altered sugar moieties or inter-sugar linkages. Exemplary among these are the phosphorothioate and other sulfur containing species which are known for use in the art. Analogs are comprised by this invention so long as they function effectively to hybridize with nucleotides of the invention. See, \ne.g.\n, Isis Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, CA; Sequitor, Inc., Natick, MA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch antisense polynucleotides can readily be synthesized using recombinant means, or can be synthesized \nin vitro\n. Equipment for such synthesis is sold by several vendors, including Applied Biosystems. The preparation of other oligonucleotides such as phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives is also well known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntisense molecules as used herein include antisense or sense oligonucleotides. Sense oligonucleotides can, \ne.g.\n, be employed to block transcription by binding to the anti-sense strand. The antisense and sense oligonucleotide comprise a single stranded nucleic acid sequence (either RNA or DNA) capable of binding to target mRNA (sense) or DNA (antisense) sequences for cancer molecules. Antisense or sense oligonucleotides, according to the present invention, comprise a fragment generally at least about 12 nucleotides, preferably from about 12 to 30 nucleotides. The ability to derive an antisense or a sense oligonucleotide, based upon a cDNA sequence encoding a given protein is described in, \ne.g.\n, \nStein &Cohen (Cancer Res. 48:2659 (1988\n and \nvan der Krol et al. (BioTechniques 6:958 (1988\n)).\n\n\n \n\n\nRibozymes\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn addition to antisense polynucleotides, ribozymes can be used to target and inhibit transcription of cancer-associated nucleotide sequences. A ribozyme is an RNA molecule that catalytically cleaves other RNA molecules. Different kinds of ribozymes have been described, including group I ribozymes, hammerhead ribozymes, hairpin ribozymes, RNase P, and axhead ribozymes (see, \ne.g.\n, \nCastanotto et al., Adv. in Pharmacology 25: 289-317 (1994\n) for a general review of the properties of different ribozymes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe general features of hairpin ribozymes are described, \ne.g.\n, in \nHampel et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 18:299-304 (1990\n); European Patent Publication No. \n \n0360257\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,254,678\n \n, Methods of preparing are well known to those of skill in the art (see, \ne.g.\n, \n \nWO 94/26877\n \n; \nOjwang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6340-6344 (1993\n); \nYamada et al., Human Gene Therapy 1:39-45 (1994\n); \nLeavitt et al., Proc. Natl, Acad Sci. USA 92:699- 703 (1995\n); \nLeavitt et al., \n); and \nYamada et al., Virology 205: 121-126 (1994\n)).\n\n\n \n\n\nUse of Modulators in Phenotypic Screening\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a test compound is administered to a population of cancer cells, which have an associated cancer expression profile. By \"administration\" or \"contacting\" herein is meant that the modulator is added to the cells in such a manner as to allow the modulator to act upon the cell, whether by uptake and intracellular action, or by action at the cell surface. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid encoding a proteinaceous agent (\ni.e.\n, a peptide) is put into a viral construct such as an adenoviral or retroviral construct, and added to the cell, such that expression of the peptide agent is accomplished, \ne.g.\n, \n \nPCT US97101419\n \n. Regulatable gene therapy systems can also be used. Once the modulator has been administered to the cells, the cells are washed if desired and are allowed to incubate under preferably physiological conditions for some period. The cells are then harvested and a new gene expression profile is generated. Thus, \ne.g.\n, cancer tissue is screened for agents that modulate, \ne.g.\n, induce or suppress, the cancer phenotype. A change in at least one gene, preferably many, of the expression profile indicates that the agent has an effect on cancer activity. Similarly, altering a biological function or a signaling pathway is indicative of modulator activity. By defining such a signature for the cancer phenotype, screens for new drugs that alter the phenotype are devised. With this approach, the drug target need not be known and need not be represented in the original gene/protein expression screening platform, nor does the level of transcript for the target protein need to change. The modulator inhibiting function will serve as a surrogate marker\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs outlined above, screens are done to assess genes or gene products. That is, having identified a particular differentially expressed gene as important in a particular state, screening of modulators of either the expression of the gene or the gene product itself is performed.\n\n\n \n\n\nUse of Modulators to Affect Peptides of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMeasurements of cancer polypeptide activity, or of the cancer phenotype are performed using a variety of assays. For example, the effects of modulators upon the function of a cancer polypeptide(s) are measured by examining parameters described above. A physiological change that affects activity is used to assess the influence of a test compound on the polypeptides of this invention. When the functional outcomes are determined using intact cells or animals, a variety of effects can be assesses such as, in the case of a cancer associated with solid tumors, tumor growth, tumor metastasis, neovascularization, hormone release, transcriptional changes to both known and uncharacterized genetic markers (\ne.g.\n, by Northern blots), changes in cell metabolism such as cell growth or pH changes, and changes in intracellular second messengers such as cGNIP.\n\n\n \n\n\nMethods of Identifying Characterizing Cancer-associated Sequences\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nExpression of various gene sequences is correlated with cancer. Accordingly, disorders based on mutant or variant cancer genes are determined. In one embodiment, the invention provides methods for identifying cells containing variant cancer genes, \ne.g.\n, determining the presence of, all or part, the sequence of at least one endogenous cancer gene in a cell. This is accomplished using any number of sequencing techniques. The invention comprises methods of identifying the cancer genotype of all individual, \ne.g.\n, determining all or part of the sequence of at least one gene of the invention in the individual. This is generally done in at least one tissue of the individual, \ne.g.\n, a tissue set forth in Table I, and may include the evaluation of a number of tissues or different samples of the same tissue. The method may include comparing the sequence of the sequenced gene to a known cancer gene, \ni.e.\n, a wild-type gene to determine the presence of family members, homologies, mutations or variants. The sequence of all or part of the gene can then be compared to the sequence of a known cancer gene to determine if any differences exist. This is done using any number of known homology programs, such as BLAST, Bestfit, etc. The presence of a difference in the sequence between the cancer gene of the patient and the known cancer gene correlates with a disease state or a propensity for a disease state, as outlined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the cancer genes are used as probes to determine the number of copies of the cancer gene in the genome. The cancer genes are used as probes to determine the chromosomal localization of the cancer genes. Information such as chromosomal localization finds use in providing a diagnosis or prognosis in particular when chromosomal abnormalities such as translocations, and the like are identified in the cancer gene locus.\n\n\n \nXIV.) RNAi and Therapeutic Use of Small Interfering RNA (siRNAs)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is also directed towards siRNA oligonucleotides, particularly double stranded RNAs encompassing at least a fragment of the PSCA coding region or 5\" UTR regions, or complement, or any antisense oligonucleotide specific to the PSCA sequence. In one embodiment such oligonucleotides are used to elucidate a function of PSCA, or are used to screen for or evaluate modulators of PSGA function or expression. In another embodiment, gene expression of PSCA is reduced by using siRNA transfection and results in significantly diminished proliferative capacity of transformed cancer cells that endogenously express the antigen; cells treated with specific PSCA siRNAs show reduced survival as measured, \ne.g.\n, by a metabolic readout of cell viability, correlating to the reduced proliferative capacity. Thus, PSCA siRNA compositions comprise siRNA (double stranded RNA) that correspond to the nucleic acid ORF sequence of the PSCA protein or subsequences thereof; these subsequences are generally 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,31, 32, 33, 34, 35 or more than 35 contiguous RNA nucleotides in length and contain sequences that are complementary and non-complementary to at least a portion of the mRNA coding sequence In a preferred embodiment, the subsequences are 19-2S nucleotides in length, most preferably 21-23 nucleotides in length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNA interference is a novel approach to silencing genes \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n, thus small double stranded RNAs (siRNAs) are valuable therapeutic agents. The power of siRNAs to silence specific gene activities has now been brought to animal models of disease and is used in humans as well. For example, hydrodynamic infusion of a solution of siRNA into a mouse with a siRNA against a particular target has been proven to be therapeutically effective.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pioneering work by Song \net al,\n indicates that one type of entirely natural nucleic acid, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), served as therapeutic agents even without further chemical modification (\nSong, E., et al. \"\nRNA interference targeting Fas protects mice from fulminant hepatitis\n\" Nat. Med. 9(3): 347-51(2003\n)). This work provided the first \nin vivo\n evidence that infusion of siRNAs into an animal could alleviate disease. In that case, the authors gave mice injections of siRNA designed to silence the FAS protein (a cell death receptor that when over-activated during inflammatory response induces hepatocytes and other cells to die). The next day, the animals were given an antibody specific to Fas. Control mice died of acute liver failure within a few days, while over 80% of the siRNA-treated mice remained free from serious disease and survived. About 80% to 90% of their liver cells incorporated the naked siRNA oligonucleotides. Furthermore, the RNA molecules functioned for 10 days before losing effect after 3 weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor use in human therapy, siRNA is delivered by efficient systems that induce long-lasting RNAi activity. A major caveat for clinical use is delivering siRNAs to the appropriate cells. Hepatocytes seem to be particularly receptive to exogenous RNA. Today, targets located in the liver are attractive because liver is an organ that can be readily targeted by nucleic acid molecules and viral vectors. However, other tissue and organs targets are preferred as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of siRNAs with compounds that promote transit across cell membranes are used to improve administration of siRNAs in therapy. Chemically modified synthetic siRNA, that are resistant to nucleases and have serum stability have concomitant enhanced duration of RNAi effects, are an additional embodiment,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, siRNA technology is a therapeutic for human malignancy by delivery of siRNA molecules directed to PSCA to individuals with the cancers, such as those listed in Table 1. Such administration of siRNAs leads to reduced growth of cancer cells expressing PSCA, and provides an anti-tumor therapy, lessening the morbidity and/or mortality associated with malignancy,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effectiveness of this modality of gene product knockdown is significant when measured \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo.\n Effectiveness \nin vitro\n is readily demonstrable through application of siRNAs to cells in culture (as described above) or to aliquots of cancer patient biopsies when \nin vitro\n methods are used to detect the reduced expression of PSCA protein.\n\n\n \nXV.)

Its expression was detected in greater than 80% of primary prostate cancers and in the majority of prostate metastasis. It has also been shown to be expressed in bladder cancer, ovary cancer, and pancreatic cancer; these cancers are listed in Table I. By immunohistochemical analysis, PSCA has been shown to be overexpressed on the cell surface of most urothelial transitional carcinoma, and in 60% of primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas. The PSCA expression data has been reported in patent publications (\n \nPCT/US98/04664\n \n, \n \nPCT/US/28883\n \n, \n \nPCT/US00/19967\n \n) and in peer-reviewed articles (\nSaffran et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2001 Feb 27; 98(5): 2658-2663\n; \nAmara et al., Cancer Res. 2001 \n; \nReiter et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1998 \n; \nArgani et al., Cancer Res. 2001 \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific expression of different PSCA variants is studied in normal and cancer patient specimens. Primers were designed to differentiate between PSCA v.1/v.2/v.4, PSCA v.3 and PSCA v.5, PSCA v.1/v.2/v.4 lead to a PCR product of 425 bp, PSCA v.3 leads to a PCR product of 300 bp, whereas PSCA v.5 leads to a PCR product of 910 bp in size (\nFigure 1I(a)\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFirst strand cDNA was prepared from normal bladder, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, prostate, spleen, skeletal muscle, testis, pancreas, colon, stomach, pools of prostate cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, ovary cancer, breast cancer, cancer metastasis, and pancreas cancer (\nFigure 1I(b)\n. Normalization was performed by PCR using primers to actin. Semi-quantitative PCR, using the variant specific primers was performed at 30 cycles of amplification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults show expression of PSCA v.5 mainly in breast cancer, cancer metastasis, and pancreas cancer, and at lower level in colon cancer and lung cancer. PSCA v.1/v.2/v.4 PCR product was detected in prostate cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, ovary cancer, breast cancer, cancer metastasis, and pancreas cancer. Amongst normal tissues, PSCA v.1/v.2/v.4 PCR product was detected only in prostate, stomach and at lower level in kidney and lung, whereas PSCA v. 5 was not detected in any normal tissue. PSCA v.3 PCR detected product was not detected in any of the samples tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimers were designed to differentiate between PSCA v.4 and PSCA v.5 (\nFigure 1J(a)\n, PSCA v.4 lead to a PCR product of 460 bp, whereas PSCA v.5 lead to a PCR product of 945 bp in size.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFirst strand cDNA was prepared from normal bladder, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, prostate, spleen, skeletal muscle, testis, pancreas, colon, stomach, pools of prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and multi-xenograft pool (prostate cancer, kidney cancer and bladder cancer xenografts) (\nFigure 1J(b)\n. Normalization was performed by PCR using primers to actin. Semi-quantitative PCR, using the variant specific primers was performed at 30 cycles of amplification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults show expression of PSCA v.4 in prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and multi-xenograft pool, normal kidney and prostate. PSCA v.5 was detected only in normal prostate and bladder cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe restricted expression of PSCA variants in normal tissues and the expression detected in cancer patient specimens indicate that PSCA variants are therapeutic, prognostic, laboratory, prophylactic, and diagnostic targets for human cancers.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSplice Variants of PSCA\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term variant includes transcript variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Transcript variants are variants of mature mRNA from the same gene which arise by alternative transcription or alternative splicing. Alternative transcripts are transcripts from the same gene but start transcription at different points. Splice variants are mRNA variants spliced differently from the same transcript. In eukaryotes, when a multi-exon gene is transcribed from genomic DNA, the initial RNA is spliced to produce functional mRNA, which has only exons and is used for translation into an amino acid sequence. Accordingly, a given gene can have zero to many alternative transcripts and each transcript can have zero to many splice variants. Each transcript variant has a unique exon makeup, and can have different coding and/or non-coding (5' or 3' end) portions, from the original transcript. Transcript variants can code for the same, similar or different proteins, such proteins having the same or a similar function or a different function. The variant proteins can be expressed in the same tissue at the same time, in a different tissue at the same time, or in the same tissue at different times, or in a different tissue at a different time. Proteins encoded by a transcript variant can have similar or different subcellular or extracellular localizations (\ne.g.\n, secreted versus intracellular).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTranscript variants are identified by a variety of art-accepted methods. For example, alternative transcripts and splice variants are identified by full-length cloning, or by use of full-length transcript and EST sequences. First, all human ESTs were grouped into clusters which show direct or indirect identity with each other. Second, ESTs in the same cluster were further grouped into sub-clusters and assembled into a consensus sequence, The original gene sequence is compared to the consensus sequence(s) or other full-length sequences. Each consensus sequence is a potential splice variant for that gene. Several confirmation modalities are known in the art, such as identification of the variant by Northern analysis, full length cloning or by use of probe libraries, etc.. Even when a variant is identified that is not yet a full-length clone, that portion of the variant is very useful as a research tool, \ne.g\n., for antigen generation or for further cloning of the full-length splice variant, using techniques known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, computer programs are available in the art that identify transcript variants based on genomic sequences. Genomic-based transcript variant identification programs include FgenesH (\nA. Salamov and V. Solovyev, \"\nAb initio gene finding in Drosophila genomic DNA,\n\" Genome Research. 2000 April; 10(4):516-22\n); Grail (URL compbio.ornl.gov/Grailbin/EmptyGrailForm) and GenScan (URL genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html). For a general discussion of splice variant identification protocols see, \ne.g.\n, \nSouthan, C., A genomic perspective on human proteases, FEBS Lett. 2001 \n; \nde Souza, S.J., et al., Identification of \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo further confirm the parameters of a transcript variant, a variety of techniques are available in the art, such as full-length cloning, proteomic validation, PCR-based validation, and 5' RACE validation, etc. (see \ne.g.\n, Proteomic Validation: \nBrennan, S.O., et al., Albumin banks peninsula: a new termination variant characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry, Biochem Biophys Acta. 1999 \n; \nFerranti P, et al., Differential splicing ofpre-messenger RNA produces multiple forms of mature caprine alpha(s1)-casein, Eur J Biochem. 1997 \n. For PCR-based Validation: \nWellmann S, et al., Specific reverse transcription-PCR quantification of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) splice variants by LightCycler technology, Clin Chem. 2001 Apr;47(4):654-60\n; \nJia, H.P., et al., Discovery of new human beta-defensins using a genomics-based approach, Gene. 2001 \n. For PCR-based and 5' RACE Validation: \nBrigle, K.E., et al., Organization of the murine reduced folate carrier gene and identification of variant splice forms, Biochem Biophys Acta. 1997 \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is known in the art that genomic regions are modulated in cancers. When the genomic region to which a gene maps is modulated in a particular cancer, the alternative transcripts or splice variants of the gene are modulated as well. Disclosed herein is that PSCA has a particular expression profile related to cancer (see, \ne\n.\ng\n., Table I). Alternative transcripts and splice variants of PSCA are also involved in cancers, for example in one or more of these tissues and in certain additional tissues as well. The variants thus serve as tumor-associated markers/antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing the full-length PSCA gene together with EST sequences, four additional transcript variants were identified, designated as PSCA v.2, v.3, v.4, and v.5. The boundaries of exons in the original transcript, PSCA v.1 were shown in Table VI. The sequences for PSCA and the PSCA variants are set forth in \nFigure 1\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle Nucleotide Polymorphisms of PSCA\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) is a single base pair variation in a nucleotide sequence at a specific location. At any given point of the genome, there are four possible nucleotide base pairs: A/T, C/G, G/C, and T/A. As used herein, an allele is one of a series of alternative forms of a given gene, differing in DNA sequence, and affecting a product (RNA and/or protein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA SNP that occurs on a cDNA is called a cSNP. This cSNP may change amino acids of the protein encoded by the gene and thus change the function of the protein. Some SNPs cause inherited diseases; others contribute to quantitative variations in phenotype and reactions to environmental factors including diet and drugs among individuals. Therefore, the existence of a SNP and/or combinations of alleles (called haplotypes) have many useful applications, such as diagnosis of inherited diseases, determination of drug reactions and dosage, identification of genes responsible for diseases, and analysis of the genetic relationship between individuals (\nP. Nowotny, J. M. Kwon and A. M. Goate, \"\n SNP analysis to dissect human traits,\n\" Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001 Oct; 11(5):637-641\n; \nM. Pirmohamed and B. K. Park, \"\nGenetic susceptibility to adverse drug reactions,\n\" Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001 Jun; 22(6):298-305\n; \nJ. H. Riley, C. J. Allan, E. Lai and A. Roses, \"\nThe use of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the isolation of common disease genes,\n\" Pharmacogenomics. 2000 Feb; 1(1):39-47\n; \nR. Judson, J. C. Stephens and A. Windemuth, \"\nThe predictive power ofhaplotypes in clinical response,\n\" Pharmacogenomics. 2000 Feb; 1(1):15-26\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSNPs are identified by a variety of art-accepted methods (\nP. Bean, \"\nThe promising voyage of SNP target discovery,\n\" Am. Clin. Lab, 2001 Oct-Nov; 20(9):18-20\n;\n K. M. Weiss, \"\nIn search of human variation,\n\" Genome Res. 1998 Jul; 8(7):691-697\n; \nM. M. She, \"\nEnabling large-scale pharmacogenetic studies by high-throughput mutation detection and genotyping technologies,\n\" Clin. Chem. 2001 Feb; 47(2):164-172\n). For example, SNPs are identified by sequencing DNA fragments that show polymorphism by gel-based methods such as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). They are also discovered by direct sequencing of DNA samples pooled from different individuals or by comparing sequences from different DNA samples. With the rapid accumulation of sequence data in public and private databases, one also discovers SNPs by comparing sequences using computer programs (\nZ. Gu, L. Hillier and P. Y. Kwok, \"\nSingle nucleotide polymorphism hunting in cyberspace,\n\" Hum. Mutat. 1998; 12(4):221-225\n). SNPs can be verified and the genotype or haplotype of an individual can be determined by a variety of methods including direct sequencing and high throughput microarrays (\nP. Y. Kwok, \"\nMethods for genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms,\n\" Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2001; 2:235-258\n; \nM. Kokoris, K. Dix, K. Moynihan, J. Mathis, B. Erwin, P. Grass, B. Hines and A. Duesterhoeft, \"\nHigh-throughput SNP genotyping with the Masscode system,\n\" Mol. Diagn. 2000 Dec; 5(4):329-340\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing the methods described above, thirteen SNP were identified in the transcript for PSCA v.2. \nVariant\n 2 was used, rather than for \nexample variant\n 1, as it had fewer ambiguous bases than \nvariant\n 1. Accordingly, SNPs were identified in PSCA v.2, at positions 57 (t/c), 367 (c/t), 424 (a/c), 495 (c/g), 499 (c/t), 563 (c/t), 567 (g/a), 627 (g/a), 634 (t/g), 835 (g/a), 847 (g/a), 878 (g/a), and 978 (c/g). The transcripts or proteins with alternative alleles were designated as variant PSCA v.6 through v.18, as shown in \nFigure 1 B\n and \nFigure 1G\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleotide change in v.6 changed the start codon of v.1 and thus, the translation would not start until the next ATG (AUG in mRNA), resulting in a \nprotein\n 9 AA shorter than v.1 protein. The nucleotide changes for v.7 and v.8 were silent at the protein level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwelve of these 13 SNPs were also present in \nvariant\n 4. The 12 SNP variants relative to PSCA v. 4 are designated PSCA v. 19 through v.30. \nVariants\n 19 through 27 encode alternative amino acids as shown in \nFigure 1H\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction of Recombinant PSCA in Prokaryotic Systems\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo express recombinant PSCA and PSCA variants in prokaryotic cells, the full or partial length PSCA and PSCA variant cDNA sequences are cloned into any one of a variety of expression vectors known in the art. One or more of the following regions of PSCA variants are expressed: the full length sequence presented in \nFigure 1\n, or any 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 or more contiguous amino acids from PSCA, variants, or analogs thereof.\n\n\n \nA. \nIn vitro\n transcription and translation constructs:\n\n\n \n \n \n \npCRII\n: To generate PSCA sense and anti-sense RNA probes for RNA in situ investigations, pCRII constructs (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) are generated encoding either all or fragments of the PSCA cDNA. The pCRII vector has Sp6 and T7 promoters flanking the insert to drive the transcription of PSCA RNA for use as probes in RNA in situ hybridization experiments. These probes are used to analyze the cell and tissue expression of PSCA at the RNA level. Transcribed PSCA RNA representing the cDNA amino acid coding region of the PSCA gene is used in \nin vitro\n translation systems such as the TnT™ Coupled Reticulolysate System (Promega, Corp., Madison, WI) to synthesize PSCA protein.\n\n\n \nB. Bacterial Constructs:\n\n\n \n \n \n \npGEX Constructs\n: To generate recombinant PSCA proteins in bacteria that are fused to the Glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein, all or parts of the PSCA cDNA protein coding sequence are cloned into the pGEX family of GST-fusion vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). These constructs allow controlled expression of recombinant PSCA protein sequences with GST fused at the amino-terminus and a six histidine epitope (6X His) at the carboxyl-terminus. The GST and 6X His tags permit purification of the recombinant fusion protein from induced bacteria with the appropriate affinity matrix and allow recognition of the fusion protein with anti-GST and anti-His antibodies. The 6X His tag is generated by adding 6 histidine codons to the cloning primer at the 3' end, e,g., of the open reading frame (ORF). A proteolytic cleavage site, such as the PreScission™ recognition site in pGEX-6P-1, may be employed such that it permits cleavage of the GST tag from PSCA-related protein. The ampicillin resistance gene and pBR322 origin permits selection and maintenance of the pGEX plasmids in \nE. coli.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \npMAL Constructs\n: To generate, in bacteria, recombinant PSCA proteins that are fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP), all or parts of the PSCA cDNA protein coding sequence are fused to the MBP gene by cloning into the pMAL-c2X and pMAL-p2X vectors (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). These constructs allow controlled expression of recombinant PSCA protein sequences with MBP fused at the amino-terminus and a 6X His epitope tag at the carboxyl-terminus. The MBP and 6X His tags permit purification of the recombinant protein from induced bacteria with the appropriate affinity matrix and allow recognition of the fusion protein with anti-MBP and anti-His antibodies. The 6X His epitope tag is generated by adding 6 histidine codons to the 3' cloning primer. A Factor Xa recognition site permits cleavage of the pMAL tag from PSCA, The pMAL-c2X and pMAL-p2X vectors are optimized to express the recombinant protein in the cytoplasm or periplasm respectively. Periplasm expression enhances folding of proteins with disulfide bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \npET Constructs\n: To express PSCA in bacterial cells, all or parts of the PSCA cDNA protein coding sequence are cloned into the pET family of vectors (Novagen, Madison, WI).\n\nThese vectors allow tightly controlled expression of recombinant PSCA protein in bacteria with and without fusion to proteins that enhance solubility, such as NusA and thioredoxin (Trx), and epitope tags, such as 6X His and S-Tag The that aid purification and detection of the recombinant protein. For example, constructs are made utilizing pET NusA fusion system 43.1 such that regions of the PSCA protein are expressed as amino-terminal fusions to NusA.\n\n\n \nC. Yeast Constructs:\n\n\n \n \n \n \npESC Constructs\n: To express PSCA in the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae for generation of recombinant protein and functional studies, all or parts of the PSCA cDNA protein coding sequence are cloned into the pESC family of vectors each of which contain 1 of 4 selectable markers, HIS3, TRP1, LEU2, and URA3 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). These vectors allow controlled expression from the same plasmid ofup to 2 different genes or cloned sequences containing either Flag™ or Myc epitope tags in the same yeast cell. This system is useful to confirm protein-protein interactions of PSCA. In addition, expression in yeast yields similar post-translational modifications, such as glycosylations and phosphorylations, that are found when expressed in eukaryotic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \npESP Constructs\n: To express PSCA in the yeast species Saccharomyces pombe, all or parts of the PSCA cDNA protein coding sequence are cloned into the pESP family of vectors. These vectors allow controlled high level of expression of a PSCA protein sequence that is fused at either the amino terminus or at the carboxyl terminus to GST which aids purification of the recombinant protein. A Flag™ epitope tag allows detection of the recombinant protein with anti- Flag™ antibody.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction of Recombinant PSCA in Higher Eukaryotic Systems\n\n\n\n\nA. Mammalian Constructs:\n\n\n \n \n \nTo express recombinant PSCA in eukaryotic cells, the full or partial length PSCA cDNA sequences, or variants thereof, can be cloned into any one of a variety of expression vectors known in the art. One or more of the following regions of PSCA are expressed in these constructs, \namino acids\n 1 to 123, or any 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 or more contiguous amino acids from PSCA v.1, PSCA variants, or analogs thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe constructs can be transfected into any one of a wide variety of mammalian cells such as 293T cells. \nTransfected\n 293T cell lysates can be probed with the anti-PSCA polyclonal serum, described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \npcDNA4/HisMax Constructs\n: To express PSCA in mammalian cells, a PSCA ORF, or portions thereof, of PSCA are cloned into pcDNA4/HisMax Version A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Protein expression is driven from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and the SP16 translational enhancer. The recombinant protein has XpressTM and six histidine (6X His) epitopes fused to the amino-terminus. The pcDNA4/HisMax vector also contains the bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation signal and transcription termination sequence to enhance mRNA stability along with the SV40 origin for episomal replication and simple vector rescue in cell lines expressing the large T antigen. The Zeocin resistance gene allows for selection of mammalian cells expressing the protein and the ampicillin resistance gene and ColE1 origin permits selection and maintenance of the plasmid in \nE. coli.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \npcDNA3.1/MycHis Constructs\n: To express PSCA in mammalian cells, a PSCA ORF, or portions thereof, of PSCA with a consensus Kozak translation initiation site was cloned into pcDNA3.1/MycHis Version A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Protein expression is driven from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The recombinant proteins have the myc epitope and 6X His epitope fused to the carboxyl-terminus. The pcDNA3.1/MycHis vector also contains the bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation signal and transcription termination sequence to enhance mRNA stability, along with the SV40 origin for episomal replication and simple vector rescue in cell lines expressing the large T antigen. The Neomycin resistance gene can be used, as it allows for selection of mammalian cells expressing the protein and the ampicillin resistance gene and ColE1 origin permits selection and maintenance of the plasmid in \nE. coli.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \npcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO Construct\n: To express PSCA in mammalian cells and to allow detection of the recombinant proteins using fluorescence, a PSCA ORF, or portions thereof, with a consensus Kozak translation initiation site are cloned into pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO (Invitrogen, CA). Protein expression is driven from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The recombinant proteins have the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) fused to the carboxyl-terminus facilitating non-invasive, \nin vivo\n detection and cell biology studies. The pcDNA3.1CT-GFP-TOPO vector also contains the bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation signal and transcription termination sequence to enhance mRNA stability along with the SV40 origin for episomal replication and simple vector rescue in cell lines expressing the large T antigen. The Neomycin resistance gene allows for selection of mammalian cells that express the protein, and the ampicillin resistance gene and ColE1 origin permits selection and maintenance of the plasmid in \nE. coli.\n Additional constructs with an amino-terminal GFP fusion are made in pcDNA3.1/NT-GPP-TOPO spanning the entire length of a PSCA protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPAPtag\n: A PSCA ORF, or portions thereof, is cloned into pAPtag-5 (GenHunter Corp. Nashville, TN). This construct generates an alkaline phosphatase fusion at the carboxyl-terminus of a PSCA protein while fusing the IgGκ signal sequence to the amino-terminus. Constructs are also generated in which alkaline phosphatase with an amino-terminal IgGκ signal sequence is fused to the amino-terminus of a PSCA protein. The resulting recombinant PSCA proteins are optimized for secretion into the media of transfected mammalian cells and can be used to identify proteins such as ligands or receptors that interact with PSCA proteins. Protein expression is driven from the CMV promoter and the recombinant proteins also contain myc and 6X His epitopes fused at the carboxyl-terminus that facilitates detection and purification. The Zeocin resistance gene present in the vector allows for selection of mammalian cells expressing the recombinant protein and the ampicillin resistance gene permits selection of the plasmid in \nE\n. \ncoli\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nptag5\n: A PSCA ORF, or portions thereof, was cloned into pTag-5. This vector is similar to pAPtag but without the alkaline phosphatase fusion. This construct generates PSCA protein with an amino-terminal IgGκ signal sequence and myc and 6X His epitope tags at the carboxyl-terminus that facilitate detection and affinity purification. The resulting recombinant PSCA protein is optimized for secretion into the media of transfected mammalian cells, and is used as immunogen or ligand to identify proteins such as ligands or receptors that interact with the PSCA proteins. Protein expression is driven from the CMV promoter. The Zeocin resistance gene present in the vector allows for selection of mammalian cells expressing the protein, and the ampicillin resistance gene permits selection of the plasmid in \nE. coli.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPsecFc:\n A PSCA ORF, or portions thereof, was cloned into psecFc. The psecFc vector was assembled by cloning the human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG) Fc (hinge, CH2, CH3 regions) into pSecTag2 (Invitrogen, California). This construct generates an IgG1 Fc fusion at the carboxyl-terminus of the PSCA proteins, while fusing the IgGK signal sequence to N-terminus. PSCA fusions utilizing the murine IgG1 Fc region are also used. The resulting recombinant PSCA proteins are optimized for secretion into the media of transfected mammalian cells, and can be used as immunogens or to identify proteins such as ligands or receptors that interact with PSCA protein. Protein expression is driven from the CMV promoter. The hygromycin resistance gene present in the vector allows for selection of mammalian cells that express the recombinant protein, and the ampicillin resistance gene permits selection of the plasmid in \nE. coli.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8\n shows expression and purification of PSCA.psecFc protein from 293T cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \npSRα Constructs\n: To generate mammalian cell lines that express PSCA constitutively, PSCA ORF, or portions thereof, of PSCA were cloned into pSRα constructs. Amphotropic and ecotropic retroviruses were generated by transfection of pSRα constructs into the 293T-10A1 packaging line or co-transfection of pSRα and a helper plasmid (containing deleted packaging sequences) into the 293 cells, respectively. The retrovirus is used to infect a variety of mammalian cell lines, resulting in the integration of the cloned gene, PSCA, into the host cell-lines. Protein expression is driven from a long terminal repeat (LTR). The Neomycin resistance gene present in the vector allows for selection of mammalian cells that express the protein, and the ampicillin resistance gene and ColEl origin permit selection and maintenance of the plasmid in \nE\n. \ncoli.\n The retroviral vectors can thereafter be used for infection and generation of various cell lines using, for example, PC3, NIH 3T3, TsuPr1, 293 or rat-1 cells,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6\n shows expression of PSCA in recombinant murine, rat and human cell lines using the PSCA.pSRα construct. The indicated murine, rat, and human cell lines were infected with retrovirus carrying the human PSCA cDNA and a neomycin resistance gene or with only the neomycin resistance gene. Stable recombinant cell lines were created by G418 drug selection. PSCA expression was determined by FACS staining with the 1 G8 anti-PSCA MAb (5 ug/ml). Shown is the FACS profile of each cell line showing a fluorescent shift only in the PSCA infected line indicating cell surface PSCA expression. These lines are useful in MAb development as immunogens, MAb screening reagents, and in functional assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional pSRα constructs are made that fuse an epitope tag such as the FLAG™ tag to the carboxyl-terminus of PSCA sequences to allow detection using anti-Flag antibodies. For example, the FLAG™ sequence 5' gat tac aag gat gac gac gat aag 3' (SEQ ID NO:76) is added to cloning primer at the 3' end of the ORF. Additional pSRα constructs are made to produce both amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal GFP and myc/6X His fusion proteins of the full-length PSCA proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAdditional Viral Vectors\n: Additional constructs are made for viral-mediated delivery and expression of PSCA. High virus titer leading to high level expression of PSCA is achieved in viral delivery systems such as adenoviral vectors and herpes amplicon vectors. A PSCA coding sequences or fragments thereof are amplified by PCR and subcloned into the AdEasy shuttle vector (Stratagene). Recombination and virus packaging are performed according to the manufacturer's instructions to generate adenoviral vectors. Alternatively, PSCA coding sequences or fragments thereof are cloned into the HSV-1 vector (Imgenex) to generate herpes viral vectors. The viral vectors are thereafter used for infection of various cell lines such as PC3, NIH 3T3, 293 or rat-1 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nRegulated Expression Systems\n: To control expression of PSCA in mammalian cells, coding sequences of PSCA, or portions thereof, are cloned into regulated mammalian expression systems such as the T-Rex System (Invitrogen), the GeneSwitch System (Invitrogen) and the tightly-regulated Ecdysone System (Sratagene). These systems allow the study of the temporal and concentration dependent effects of recombinant PSCA. These vectors are thereafter used to control expression of PSCA in various cell lines such as PC3, NIH 3T3, 293 or rat-1 cells.\n\n\n \nB. Baculovirus Expression Systems\n\n\n \n \n \nTo generate recombinant PSCA proteins in a baculovirus expression system, PSCA ORF, or portions thereof, are cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBac 4.5 (Invitrogen), which provides a His-tag at the N-terminus. Specifically, pBlueBac-PSCA is co-transfected with helper plasmid pBac-N-Blue (Invitrogen) into SF9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) insect cells to generate recombinant baculovirus (see Invitrogen instruction manual for details). Baculovirus is then collected from cell supernatant and purified by plaque assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant PSCA protein is then generated by infection of HighFive insect cells (Invitrogen) with purified baculovirus. Recombinant PSCA protein can be detected using anti-PSCA or anti-His-tag antibody. PSCA protein can be purified and used in various cell-based assays or as immunogen to generate polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific for PSCA.\n\n\n \nC. Expression Vectors for PSCA Orthologs\n\n\n \n \n \nMouse and monkey orthologs of PSCA were cloned into pcDNA3.1/MycHis Version A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Protein expression is driven from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The recombinant proteins have the myc epitope and 6X His epitope fused to the carboxyl-terminus. These vectors allow expression of PSCA orthologs to assay cross-reactivity of monoclonal anti-human PSCA antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMouse and monkey orthologs of PSCA were also cloned into pSRα constructs. The pSRα constructs allow for the generation of mammalian cell lines that express PSCA orthologs constitutively. Protein expression is driven from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The recombinant proteins have the myc epitope and 6X His epitope fused to the carboxyl-terminus. These vectors allow expression of PSCA orthologs to assay cross-reactivity of monoclonal anti-human PSCA antibodies and to study functional activity of PSCA orthologs. Amphotropic and ecotropic retroviruses were generated by transfection of pSRα constructs into the 293T-10A1 packaging line or co-transfection of pSRα and a helper plasmid (containing deleted packaging sequences) into the 293 cells, respectively. The retrovirus is used to infect a variety of mammalian cell lines, resulting in the integration of the cloned gene, PSCA ortholog, into the host cell-lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7\n shows expression of mouse and simian PSCA.pcDNA3.1/MycHis following transfection into 293T cells. 293T cells were transfected with either mouse PSCA.pcDNA3.1/MycHis or simian PSCA.pcDNA3.1/MycHis or pcDNA3.1/MycHis vector control. Forty hours later, cells were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry using anti-PSCA monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntigenicity Profiles and Secondary Structure\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAmino acid profiles of \n \n \nPSCA variants\n \n \n 1, 3, and 4, were found accessing the ProtScale website on the World Wide Web at (.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/protscale.pl) on the ExPasy molecular biology server.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese profiles: Hydrophilicity, (\nHopp T.P., Woods K.R., 1981. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:3824-3828\n); Hydropathicity, (\nKyte J., Doolittle R.F., 1982. J. Mol. Biol. 157:105-132\n); Percentage Accessible Residues (\nJanin J., 1979 Nature 277:491-492\n); Average Flexibility, (\nBhaskaran R., and Ponnuswamy P.K., 1988. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 32:242-255\n); Beta-turn (\nDeleage, G., Roux B. 1987 Protein Engineering 1:289-294\n); and optionally others available in the art, such as on the ProtScale website, were used to identify antigenic regions of each of the PSCA variant proteins. Each of the above amino acid profiles of PSCA variants were generated using the following ProtScale parameters for analysis: 1) A window size of 9; 2) 100% weight of the window edges compared to the window center; and, 3) amino acid profile values normalized to lie between 0 and 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHydrophilicity, Hydropathicity, and Percentage Accessible Residues profiles were used to determine stretches of hydrophilic amino acids (i.e., values greater than 0.5 on the Hydrophilicity and Percentage Accessible Residues profile, and values less than 0.5 on the Hydropathicity profile). Such regions are likely to be exposed to the aqueous environment, be present on the surface of the protein, and thus available for immune recognition, such as by antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAverage Flexibility and Beta-turn profiles determine stretches of amino acids (\ni.e\n., values greater than 0.5 on the Beta-turn profile and the Average Flexibility profile) that are not constrained in secondary structures such as beta sheets and alpha helices. Such regions are also more likely to be exposed on the protein and thus accessible to immune recognition, such as by antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigenic sequences of the PSCA variant proteins indicated, \ne.g\n., by the profiles described above are used to prepare immunogens, either peptides or nucleic acids that encode them, to generate therapeutic and diagnostic anti-PSCA antibodies. The immunogen can be any 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 or more than 50 contiguous amino acids, or the corresponding nucleic acids that encode them, from the PSCA protein variants listed in \nFigure 1\n of which the amino acid profiles can be inferred because the variant contains sequence that is the same as a variant depicted. In particular, peptide immunogens of the invention can comprise, a peptide region of at least 5 amino acids of \nFigure 1\n in any whole number increment that includes an amino acid position having a value greater than 0.5 in the Hydrophilicity profile; a peptide region of at least 5 amino acids of \nFigure 1\n in any whole number increment that includes an amino acid position having a value less than 0.5 in the Hydropathicity profile; a peptide region of at least 5 amino acids of \nFigure 1\n in any whole number increment that includes an amino acid position having a value greater than 0.5 in the Percent Accessible Residues profiles; a peptide region of at least 5 amino acids of \nFigures 1\n in any whole number increment that includes an amino acid position having a value greater than 0.5 in the Average Flexibility profiles; and, a peptide region of at least 5 amino acids of \nFigure 1\n in any whole number increment that includes an amino acid position having a value greater than 0.5 in the Beta-turn profile. Peptide immunogens of the invention can also comprise nucleic acids that encode any of the forgoing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll immunogens of the invention, peptide or nucleic acid, can be embodied in human unit dose form, or comprised by a composition that includes a pharmaceutical excipient compatible with human physiology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe secondary structure of \n \n \n \nPSCA protein variants\n \n \n \n 1, 3, 4, and 6, namely the predicted presence and location of alpha helices, extended strands, and random coils, is predicted from the primary amino acid sequence using the HNN - Hierarchical Neural Network method (\nNPS@: Network Protein \n), accessed from the ExPasy molecular biology server located on the World Wide Web at (.expasy.ch/tools/). The analysis indicates that \nPSCA variant\n 1 is composed of 30.89% alpha helix, 21.95% extended strand, and 47.15% random coil. \nPSCA protein variant\n 3 is composed of 14.89% alpha helix, 8.51% extended strand, and 76.60% random coil. \nPSCA protein variant\n 4 is composed of 9.52% alpha helix, 8.99% extended strand, and 81.48% random coil. \nPSCA protein variant\n 6 is composed of 24.56% alpha helix, 21.93% extended strand, and 53.51% random coil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis for the potential presence of transmembrane domains in the PSCA variant proteins was carried out using a variety of transmembrane prediction algorithms accessed from the ExPasy molecular biology server located on the World Wide Web at (.expasy.ch/tools/).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration of PSCA Polyclonal Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPolyclonal antibodies can be raised in a mammal, for example, by one or more injections of an immunizing agent and, if desired, an adjuvant. Typically, the immunizing agent and/or adjuvant will be injected in the mammal by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections. In addition to immunizing with a full length PSCA protein variant, computer algorithms are employed in design of immunogens that, based on amino acid sequence analysis contain characteristics of being antigenic and available for recognition by the immune system of the immunized host (see the Example entitled \"Antigenicity Profiles and Secondary Structure\"). Such regions would be predicted to be hydrophilic, flexible, in beta-turn conformations, and be exposed on the surface of the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, recombinant bacterial fusion proteins or peptides containing hydrophilic, flexible, beta-turn regions of PSCA protein variants are used as antigens to generate polyclonal antibodies in New Zealand White rabbits or monoclonal antibodies as described in the Example entitled \"Generation of PSCA Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs)\". For example, in \nPSCA variant\n 1, such regions include, but are not limited to, amino acids 28-56 and amino acids 66-94. For \nvariant\n 3, such regions include, but are not limited to, amino acids 7-39 and amino acids 70-94. For \nvariant\n 4 such regions include, but are not limited to, amino acids 6-18, amino acids 27-39, amino acids 103-133, and 177-189. For \nvariant\n 6, such regions include, but are not limited to, amino acids 19-35 and amino acids 57-85, It is useful to conjugate the immunizing agent to a protein known to be immunogenic in the mammal being immunized. Examples of such immunogenic proteins include, but are not limited to, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. In one embodiment, a peptide encoding amino acids 103-133 of \nPSCA variant\n 4 is conjugated to KLH and used to immunize a rabbit. Alternatively the immunizing agent may include all or portions of the PSCA variant proteins, analogs or fusion proteins thereof. For example, the PSCA variants amino acid sequences can be fused using recombinant DNA techniques to any one of a variety of fusion protein partners that are well known in the art, such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and HIS tagged fusion proteins. In one embodiment, the \nPSCA variant\n 1 sequence, amino acids 18-98 was fused to GST using recombinant techniques in the pGEX expression vector, expressed, purified and used to immunize both rabbits and mice to generate polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies respectively. Such fusion proteins are purified from induced bacteria using the appropriate affinity matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther recombinant bacterial fusion proteins that may be employed include maltose binding protein, LacZ, thioredoxin, NusA, or an immunoglobulin constant region (see the section entitled \"\nProduction of PSCA in Prokaryotic Systems\" and Current Protocols In Molecular Biology, \n; \nLinsley, P.S., Brady, W., Urnes, M., Grosmaire, L., Damle, N., and Ledbetter, L.(1991) J.Exp. Med. 174, 561-566\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to bacterial derived fusion proteins, mammalian expressed protein antigens are also used. These antigens are expressed from mammalian expression vectors such as the Tag5 and Fc-fusion vectors (see the section entitled \"Production of Recombinant PSCA in Eukaryotic Systems\"), and retain post-translational modifications such as glycosylations found in native protein. In one embodiment, the cDNA of \nPSCA variant\n 1, minus the N-terminal leader peptide and C-terminal GPI anchor was cloned into the Tag5 mammalian secretion vector, and expressed in 293T cells. The recombinant protein was purified by metal chelate chromatography from tissue culture supernatants of 293T cells stably expressing the recombinant vector. The purified Tag5 PSCA protein was then used as immunogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring the immunization protocol, it is useful to mix or emulsify the antigen in adjuvants that enhance the immune response of the host animal. Examples of adjuvants include, but are not limited to, complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and MPL-TDM adjuvant (monophosphoryl Lipid A, synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a typical protocol, rabbits are initially immunized subcutaneously with up to 200 µg, typically 100-200 µg, of fusion protein or peptide conjugated to KLH mixed in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Rabbits are then injected subcutaneously every two weeks with up to 200 µg, typically 100-200 µg, of the immunogen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA). Test bleeds are taken approximately 7-10 days following each immunization and used to monitor the titer of the antiserum by ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo test reactivity and specificity of immune serum, such as rabbit serum derived from immunization with a GST-fusion of \n \nPSCA variant\n \n 3 or 4 protein, the respective full-length PSCA variant cDNA is cloned into pCDNA 3.1 myc-his expression vector (Invitrogen, see the Example entitled \"Production of Recombinant PSCA in Eukaryotic Systems\"). After transfection of the constructs into 293T cells, cell lysates are probed with the anti-variant serum and with anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) to determine specific reactivity to denatured variant protein using the Western blot technique. In addition, the immune serum is tested by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation against 293T and other recombinant PSCA variant-expressing cells to determine specific recognition of native protein. Western blot, immunoprecipitation, fluorescent microscopy, and flow cytometric techniques using cells that endogenously express PSCA are also carried out to test reactivity and specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-serum from rabbits immunized with PSCA variant fusion proteins, such as GST and MBP fusion proteins, are purified by depletion of antibodies reactive to the fusion partner sequence by passage over an affinity column containing the fusion partner either alone or in the context of an irrelevant fusion protein. For example, antiserum derived from a GST-\nPSCA variant\n 1 fusion protein is first purified by passage over a column of GST protein covalently coupled to AffiGel matrix (BioRad, Hercules, Calif.). The antiserum is then affinity purified by passage over a column composed of a MBP-PSCA fusion protein covalently coupled to Affigel matrix. The serum is then further purified by protein G affinity chromatography to isolate the IgG fraction. Sera from other His-tagged antigens and peptide immunized rabbits as well as fusion partner depleted sera are affinity purified by passage over a column matrix composed of the original protein immunogen or free peptide.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration of PSCA Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies (\"MAbs\") to PSCA and PSCA variants comprise those that react with epitopes specific for each protein or specific to sequences in common between the variants that would bind, internalize, disrupt or modulate the biological function of PSCA or PSCA variants, for example, those that would disrupt the interaction with ligands and binding partners. Immunogens for generation of such MAbs include those designed to encode or contain the extracellular domain or the entire PSCA protein sequence, regions predicted to contain functional motifs, and regions of the PSCA protein variants predicted to be antigenic from computer analysis of the amino acid sequence. Immunogens include peptides, recombinant bacterial proteins such as GST-PSCA fusion proteins (\nFigure 8\n) and His tagged PSCA pET vector protein (\nFigure 6\n) and mammalian expressed purified His tagged proteins (\nFigure 7\n) and human and murine IgG FC fusion proteins. In addition, Cells engineered through retroviral transduction to express high levels of \nPSCA variant\n 1, such as RAT1-PSCA. 293T-PSCA, 3T3-PSCA or 300.19-PSCA are used to immunize mice (\nFigure 5\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo generate Monoclonal Antibodies to PSCA, mice were first immunized in the foot pad (FP) with, typically, 5-50 µg of protein immunogen or between 10\n6\n and 10\n7\n PSCA-expressing cells mixed in a suitable adjuvant. Examples of suitable adjuvants for FP immunizations are TiterMax (Sigma) for the initial FP injection followed by alum gel with Immuneasy (Qiagen). Following the initial injection mice were subsequently immunized twice a week until the time they are sacrificed and B cells obtained from the lymph node used for fusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring the immunization protocol, test bleeds were taken to monitor the titer and specificity of the immune response. In most cases, once appropriate reactivity and specificity was obtained as determined by ELISA, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometric analyses, fusion and hybridoma generation was then carried out using electrocell fusion (BTX, ECM2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides for monoclonal antibodies designated, Hal-1.16, Hal-5.99, Hal-4.117, Hal-4.120, Hal-4.121, and Hal-4.37. The antibodies were identified and are shown to react and bind with cell surface or immobilized PSCA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMAbs to PSCA were generated using XenoMouse technology\n®\n wherein the murine heavy and kappa light chain loci have been inactivated and a majority of the human heavy and kappa light chain immunoglobulin loci have been inserted: Hal-1.16 was generated after immunizing \nhuman gamma\n 1 producing Xenomice (13 times with PSCA-GST); Hal-5.99 was generated after immunizing \nhuman gamma\n 2 producing \nXenomice\n 6 times with Rat1-PSCA cells followed by two injections with PSCA-tag5; Ha1-4.117, HA1-4.37, Ha1-4.120, and Ha1-4.121 were generated after immunizing \nhuman gamma\n 1 producing Xenomice) 6 times with Rat1-PSCA cells followed by 4 injections with PSCA-tag5. The anti-PSCA MAbs, Ha1-1.16, Ha1-5.99 Ha1-4.117, Ha1-4.120, and Ha1-4.121 bind endogenous cell surface PSCA expressed in prostate cancer xenograft cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies designated Ha1-5.99, Ha1-4.117, Ha1-4.120, Ha1-4.37, Ha1-1.16 and Ha1-4.121 were sent (via Federal Express) to the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), P.O. Box 1549, Manassas, VA 20108 on 04-May-2004 and assigned Accession numbers PTA-6703 and PTA-6699 and PTA-6700 and PTA-6702 and PTA-6698 and PTA-6701 respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA coding sequences for anti PSCA MAbs Ha1-1.16, Ha1-5.99, Ha1-4.117, Ha1-4.120, Ha1-4.121, and Ha1-4.37, were determined after isolating mRNA from the respective hybridoma cells with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Gibco BRL). Total RNA was purified and quantified. First strand cDNAs was generated from total RNA with oligo (dT)12 18 priming using the Gibco BRL Superscript Preamplification system. First strand cDNA was amplified using human immunoglobulin variable heavy chain primers, and human immunoglobulin variable light chain primers, PCR products were cloned into the pCRScript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla). Several clones were sequenced and the variable heavy and light chain regions determined. The nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of the variable heavy and light chain regions are listed in \nFigure 2\n and \nFigure 3\n. Alignment of PSCA antibodies to germline V-D-J Sequences is shown in \nFigure 4A - Figure 4M\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreening and Identification of PSCA Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies generated using the procedures set forth in the example entitled \"Generation of PSCA Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs)\" were screened and identified using a combination of assays including ELISA, FACS, epitope grouping, and affinity for PSCA expressed on the cell surface.\n\n\n \nA. PSCA human MAb screening by FACS.\n\n\n \n \n \nPrimary hybridoma screening for MAbs toPSCA was performed by FACS. The protocol was as follows: 50ul/well of hybridoma supernatant (neat) or purified antibodies (in serial dilutions) were added to 96-well FACS plates and mixed with PSCA-expressing cells (endogenous or recombinant, 50,000 cells/well). The mixture was incubated at 4°C for two hours. At the end of incubation, the cells were washed with FACS Buffer and incubated with 100ul of detection antibody (anti-hIgG-PE) for 45 minutes at 4°C. At the end of incubation, the cells were washed with FACS Buffer, fixed with Formaldehyde and analyzed using FACScan. Data were analyzed using CellQuest Pro software. Filled histograms indicate data from negative control cells, and open histograms represent data from PSCA-positive cells (\nFigure 9\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPositive hybridomas identified from primary screens were transferred to 24-well plates and supernatants collected for confirmatory screens. Confirmatory screens included FACs analysis on 8300.19-PSCA/300.19-neo, Ratl-PSCA/Ratl-neo, PC3-PSCA/neo, SW780 (bladder cancer cell line), LAPC9AI (prostate cancer cell line), HPAC (pancreatic cancer cell line), and ELISA assay using Tag5-PSCA, GST-PSCA, GST-PSCA N-term, Med. C-Term, and pET-PSCA.\n\n\n \nB. PSCA human MAb Relative Affinity Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe hybridoma supernatants were tested to determine their relative binding affinity to cell surface PSCA. Hybridoma supernatants were serially diluted in FACS Buffer (FB), from µg/ml to sub-ng/ml; and evaluated in a FACS binding assay using LAPC9AI cells. High affinity antibodies gave high MFI values. MFI values of each point were obtained using CollQuest Pro software and used for affinity calculation using Graphpad Prism software (Table VII and Table VIII): Sigmoidal Dose-Response (variable slope) equation. The results of the relative affinity analysis is set forth in \nFigure 10\n.\n\n\n \nC. Epitope Grouping\n\n\n \n \n \nPSCA antibodies were grouped according to epitope by evaluating their binding pattern on LAPC9AI cells. In brief, a small amount of each of the antibodies was biotinylated; then each of the biotinylated antibodies were incubated with LAPC9AI in the presence of excess (100 x) amount of non-biotinylated antibodies at 4°C for 1 hour during the incubation. Generally, an excess amount of antibodies will compete with biotinylated antibodies if they bind to the same epitope. At the end of incubation, cells were washed and incubated with Streptavidin-PE for 45 min at 4°C. After washing off the unbound streptavidin-PE, the cells were analyzed using FACS. MFI determinations were used for data analysis (Table VII). As shown in Table XI, cells highlighted in yellow indicate self-competition (100% competition), the MFI in these cells are background control for each biotinylated antibody. Cells with no color indicate that the two antibodies compete each other (low MFI), high MFI (highlighted in blue) indicate that the two antibodies bind to two distinct epitopes. The antibodies that have same binding pattern bind to same epitope among the antibodies. There are 6 epitope groups within the antibodies tested. Table XI shows that PSCA 4.121 binds to its unique epitope.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacterization and Expression of PSCA Antibodies\n\n\n\n\nA. Cross Reactivity with Monkey PSCA and Mouse PSCA\n\n\n \n \n \nMAbs were screened and characterized for their ability to react with PSCA from mouse and simian origin. This property is useful to understand the consequences of MAb engagement of PSCA on cells and tissues when using mouse and simian animal models. The Cynomolgus monkey and mouse PSCA genes were cloned, expressed in a retrovirus and transiently infected into 293-T cells.\n          \n were incubated with the respective antibodies using the following protocol. Test antibodies were incubated with 293-T cells expressing either Cynomolgus monkey or murine PSCA or 293T cells expressing the-neo gene gene only as a negative control. Specific recognition was determined using anti-hIgG-PE secondary detection antibody. A representative histogram depicting specied cross-reactivity is presented in \nFigure 11\n. The summary presented in Table X shows that all but one of the anti-human PSCA antibodies cross-react with monkey PSCA and only one anti-human PSCA antibody cross-reacts with mouse PSCA.\n\n\n \nB. Affinity Determination by FACS\n\n\n \n \n \nA panel of seven (7) anti-human PSCA antibodies was tested for their binding affinity to PSCA on SW780 cells, a human bladder cancer cell line expressing high level of PSCA. 23 serial 1:2 dilutions of purified antibodies were incubated with SW780 cells (50,000 cells per well) over night at 4°C with final concentration of 167nM to 0.01pM. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed and incubated with anti-hIgG-PE detection antibody for 45 min at 4°C. After washing the unbound detection antibodies, the cells were analyzed by FACS; MFI values of each point were obtained using CellQuest Pro software and were used for affinity calculation using Graphpad Prism software: Sigmoidal Dose-Response (variable slope) equation (Table VII and Table VIII). Affinity values of the seven (7) antibodies are set forth in Table IX.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSCA Antibody Internalization\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nInternalization of Ha1-4.121 was studied using PC3-PSCA cells. In brief, Ha1-4.121 was incubated with cells at 4°C for 90 min to allow binding of the antibodies to the cell surface. The cells were then split into two groups and incubation continued at either 37°C to allow antibody internalization or at 4°C as controls (no internalization). An acid-wash after 37°C/4°C incubation was employed to remove PSCA 4.121 bound on cell surface. Subsequent permeablization allowed detection of antibodies bound to internalized PSCA. After incubation with secondary detection antibodies, cells were analyzed using FACS or observed under fluorescence microscope. Approximately 30% of Ha1-4.121 internalized after incubation at 37°C for two hours (\nFigure 12\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody mediated secondary killing\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies to PSCA mediate saporin dependent killing in PSCA expressing cells. B300.19 -PSCA expressing cells (750 cells/well) were seeded into a 96 well plate on \nday\n 1. The following day an equal volume of medium containing 2X concentration of the indicated primary antibody together with a 2 fold excess of anti-human (Hum-Zap) or anti-goat (Goat-Zap) polyclonal antibody conjugated with saporin toxin (Advanced Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA) was added to each well. The cells were allowed to incubate for 5 days at 37 degrees C. At the end of the incubation period, MTS (Promega) was added to each well and incubation continued for an additional 4 hours. The OD at 450 nM was determined. The results in Figrue 13(A) show that PSCA antibodies HA1-4.121 and HA1-4.117 mediated saporin dependent cytotoxicity in B300.19-PSCA cells while a control, nonspecific human IgG1, antibody had no effect. The results in \nFigure 13(B)\n show that addition of a secondary saporin conjugated antibody that did not recognize human Fc, failed to mediate cytotoxicity (\nFigure 13(A) and Figure 13(B)\n). These results indicate that drugs or cytotoxic proteins can selectively be delivered to PSCA expressing cells using an appropriate anti-PSCA MAb.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody Immune Mediated Cytotoxicity\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPSCA antibodies were evaluated to determine their ability to mediate immune dependent cytotoxicity. PSCA antibodies (0-50 µg/ml) were diluted with RHB buffer (RPMI 1640, Gibco Life Technologies, 20 mM HEPES). B300.19-PSCA expressing cells were washed in RHB buffer and resuspended at a density of 10\n6\n cells/ml. In a typical assay, 50 µl of PSCA antibody, 50 µl of diluted rabbit complement serum (Cedarlane, Ontario, Can), and 50 µl of a cell suspension were added together into a flat-bottom tissue culture 96-well plate. The mixture was incubated for 2 hr. at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator to facilitate complement-mediated cell lysis. Then, 50 µl of Alamar Blue (Biosource Intl. Camarillo, CA) was added to each well and incubation continued for an additional 4-5 hr at 37°C. The fluorescence in each well was read using a 96-well fluorometer with excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm. The results show that PSCA antibodies having an Ig1 (HA1-4.121) or an IgG2 isotype (HA1-5.99.1) but not an IgG4 isotype (HA1-6.46) were able to mediate complement dependent lysis (\nFigure 14\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nADCC (Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity) is an immune mediate lytic attack on cells bound with an antibody targeted to a specific cell surface antigen. In this case it is PSCA. Immune cells recognize the Fc portion of the antibody through binding to Fcγ receptors on the surface of leukocyte, monocyte and NK cells triggering a lytic attack that results in cell death. The ability of PSCA antibodies to mediate this reaction can be evaluated by labeling tumor cells \nin vitro\n with \n51\nchromium, europium or a fluorescent molecule and incubating them in the presence of human PSCA MAbs together with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Specific lysis of the tumor cells can be determined by measuring the per cent lysis of the targeted tumor cells. Common endpoints that are determined include release of radioactivity, europium or fluorescent dye from the dead cells using an appropriate detection method. Alternatively, the release of an intracellular enzyme such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can be measured.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration of F(Ab')2 Fragments\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nGeneration of F(Ab')2 fragments of MAbs is useful to study the effects of MAb molecules that retain their bivalent anitgen binding site but lack the immune effector Fc domain in \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n therapeutic models. 20 mgs of MAb Ha1-4.121 in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 4.5 was incubated with and without immobilized pepsin (Pierce. Rockford IL) for the indicated times. Intact MAb and digested Fc fragments were removed by protein A chromatography. Shown in \nFigure 15\n is a SDS-PAGE Coomasie stained gel of intact undigested unreduced MAb, unreduced aliquots of digested material taken at the indicated times, and a reduced sample of the final digested F(ab')2 product. This reagent can be used to treat animals bearing PSCA expressing tumors. The anti-tumor activity observed with this antibody fragment can distinguish intrinsic biologic activity from activity mediated by immune dependent mechanisms.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpression of Human Antibodies using Recombinant DNA Methods\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo express anti-PSCA MAbs recombinantly in transfected cells, anti-PSCA variable heavy and light chain sequences were cloned upstream of the human heavy chain IgG1 and light chain Igκ constant regions respectively. The complete anti-PSCA human heavy chain and light chain cassettes were cloned downstream of the CMV promoter/enhancer in a cloning vector. A polyadenylation site was included downstream of the MAb coding sequence. The recombinant anti-PSCA MAb expressing constructs were transfected into 293T, Cos and CHO cells. The HA1-4.121 antibody secreted from recombinant 293-T cells was evaluated for binding to cell surfacef PSCA in Figure Pia-3A and compared with the same antibody produced from the original hybridoma (\nFigure 16\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHLA Class I and Class II Binding Assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHLA class I and class II binding assays using purified HLA molecules are performed in accordance with disclosed protocols (\ne.g.\n, \n \nPCT publications WO 94/20127\n \n and \n \nWO 94/03205\n \n; \nSidney et al., Current Protocols in Immunology 18.3.1 (1998\n); \nSidney, et al., J. Immunol. 154:247 (1995\n); \nSette, et al., Mol. Immunol. 31:813 (1994\n)). Briefly, purified MHC molecules (5 to 500 nM) are incubated with various unlabeled peptide inhibitors and 1-10 nM \n125\nI-radiolabeled probe peptides as described. Following incubation, MHC-peptide complexes are separated from free peptide by gel filtration and the fraction of peptide bound is determined. Typically, in preliminary experiments, each MHC preparation is titered in the presence of fixed amounts of radiolabeled peptides to determine the concentration of HLA molecules necessary to bind 10-20% of the total radioactivity. All subsequent inhibition and direct binding assays are performed using these HLA concentrations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince under these conditions [label]<[HLA] and IC\n50\n [HLA], the measured IC\n50\n values are reasonable approximations of the true KD values. Peptide inhibitors are typically tested at concentrations ranging from 120 µg/ml to 1.2 ng/ml, and are tested in two to four completely independent experiments. To allow comparison of the data obtained in different experiments, a relative binding figure is calculated for each peptide by dividing the IC\n50\n of a positive control for inhibition by the IC\n50\n for each tested peptide (typically unlabeled versions of the radiolabeled probe peptide). For database purposes, and inter-experiment comparisons, relative binding values are compiled. These values can subsequently be converted back into IC50 nM values by dividing the IC50 nM of the positive controls for inhibition by the relative binding of the peptide of interest. This method of data compilation is accurate and consistent for comparing peptides that have been tested on different days, or with different lots of purified MHC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding assays as outlined above may be used to analyze HLA supermotif and/or HLA motif-bearing peptides (see Table IV).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction of \"Miniegene\" Multi-Epitope DNA Plasmids\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example discusses the construction of a minigene expression plasmid. Minigene plasmids may, of course, contain various configurations of B cell, CTL and/or HTL epitopes or epitope analogs as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA minigene expression plasmid typically includes multiple CTL and HTL peptide epitopes. In the present example, HLA-A2, -A3, -B7 supermotif-bearing peptide epitopes and HLA-A1 and -A24 motif-bearing peptide epitopes are used in conjunction with DR supermotif-bearing epitopes and/or DR3 epitopes, HLA class I supermotif or motif-bearing peptide epitopes derived PSCA, are selected such that multiple supermotifs/motifs are represented to ensure broad population coverage. Similarly, HLA class II epitopes are selected from PSCA to provide broad population coverage, \ni.e.\n both HLA DR-1-4-7 supermotif-bearing epitopes and HLA DR-3 motif-bearing epitopes are selected for inclusion in the minigene construct. The selected CTL and HTL epitopes are then incorporated into a minigene for expression in an expression vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch a construct may additionally include sequences that direct the HTL epitopes to the endoplasmic reticulum. For example, the Ii protein may be fused to one or more HTL epitopes as described in the art, wherein the CLIP sequence of the Ii protein is removed and replaced with an HLA class II epitope sequence so that HLA class II epitope is directed to the endoplasmic reticulum, where the epitope binds to an HLA class II molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis example illustrates the methods to be used for construction of a minigene-bearing expression plasmid. Other expression vectors that may be used for minigene compositions are available and known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe minigene DNA plasmid of this example contains a consensus Kozak sequence and a consensus murine kappa Ig-light chain signal sequence followed by CTL and/or HTL epitopes selected in accordance with principles disclosed herein. The sequence encodes an open reading frame fused to the Myc and His antibody epitope tag coded for by the pcDNA 3.1 Myc-His vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverlapping oligonucleotides that can, for example, average about 70 nucleotides in length with 15 nucleotide overlaps, are synthesized and HPLC-purifted. The oligonucleotides encode the selected peptide epitopes as well as appropriate linker nucleotides, Kozak sequence, and signal sequence. The final multiepitope minigene is assembled by extending the overlapping oligonucleotides in three sets of reactions using PCR. A Perkin/Elmer 9600 PCR machine is used and a total of 30 cycles are performed using the following conditions: 95°C for 15 sec, annealing temperature (5° below the lowest calculated Tm of each primer pair) for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a minigene is prepared as follows. For a first PCR reaction, 5 µg of each of two oligonucleotides are annealed and extended: In an example using eight oligonucleotides, \ni.e.\n, four pairs of primers, \noligonucleotides\n 1+2, 3+4, 5+6, and 7+8 are combined in 100 µl reactions containing Pfu polymerase buffer (1x= 10 mM KCL, 10 mM (NH\n4\n)\n2\nSO\n4\n, 20 mM Tris-chloride, pH 8.75, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 µg/ml BSA), 0.25 mM each dNTP, and 2.5 U of Pfu polymerase. The full-length dimer products are gel-purified, and two reactions containing the product of 1+2 and 3+4, and the product of 5+6 and 7+8 are mixed, annealed, and extended for 10 cycles. Half of the two reactions are then mixed, and 5 cycles of annealing and extension carried out before flanking primers are added to amplify the full length product. The full-length product is gel-purified and cloned into pCR-blunt (Invitrogen) and individual clones are screened by sequencing.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Plasmid Construct and the Degree to Which It Induces Immunogenicity.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe degree to which a plasmid construct, for example a plasmid constructed in accordance with the previous Example, is able to induce immunogenicity is confirmed \nin vitro\n by determining epitope presentation by APC following transduction or transfection of the APC with an epitope-expressing nucleic acid construct. Such a study determines \"antigenicity\" and allows the use of human APC. The assay determines the ability of the epitope to be presented by the APC in a context that is recognized by a T cell by quantifying the density of epitope-HLA class I complexes on the cell surface. Quantitation can be performed by directly measuring the amount of peptide eluted from the APC (see, \ne.g.\n, \nSijts et al., J. Immunol. 156:683-692, 1996\n; \nDemotz et al., Nature 342:682-684, 1989\n); or the number of peptide-HLA class I complexes can be estimated by measuring the amount of lysis or lymphokine release induced by diseased or transfected target cells, and then determining the concentration of peptide necessary to obtain equivalent levels of lysis or lymphokine release (see, \ne.g.\n, \nKageyama et al., J. Immunol. 154:567-576, 1995\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, immunogenicity is confirmed through \nin vivo\n injections into mice and subsequent \nin vitro\n assessment of CTL and HTL activity, which are analyzed using cytotoxicity and proliferation assays, respectively, as detailed \ne.g.\n, in \nAlexander et al., Immunity 1:751-761, 1994\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, to confirm the capacity of a DNA minigene construct containing at least one HLA-A2 supermotif peptide to induce CTLs \nin vivo\n, HLA-A2.1/K\nb\n transgenic mice, for example, are immunized intramuscularly with 100 µg of naked cDNA. As a means of comparing the level of CTLs induced by cDNA immunization, a control group of animals is also immunized with an actual peptide composition that comprises multiple epitopes synthesized as a single polypeptide as they would be encoded by the minigene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSplenocytes from immunized animals are stimulated twice with each of the respective compositions (peptide epitopes encoded in the minigene or the polyepitopic peptide), then assayed for peptide-specific cytotoxic activity in a \n51\nCr release assay. The results indicate the magnitude of the CTL response directed against the A2-restricted epitope, thus indicating the \nin vivo\n immunogenicity of the minigene vaccine and polyepitopic vaccine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is, therefore, found that the minigene elicits immune responses directed toward the HLA-A2 supermotif peptide epitopes as does the polyepitopic peptide vaccine. A similar analysis is also performed using other HLA-A3 and HLA-B7 transgenic mouse models to assess CTL induction by HLA-A3 and HLA-B7 motif or supermotif epitopes, whereby it is also found that the minigene elicits appropriate immune responses directed toward the provided epitopes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo confirm the capacity of a class II epitope-encoding minigene to induce HTLs \nin vivo\n, DR transgenic mice, or for those epitopes that cross react with the appropriate mouse MHC molecule, I-A\nb\n-restricted mice, for example, are immunized intramuscularly with 100 µg of plasmid DNA. As a means of comparing the level of HTLs induced by DNA immunization, a group of control animals is also immunized with an actual peptide composition emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. CD4+ T cells, \ni.e.\n HTLs, are purified from splenocytes of immunized animals and stimulated with each of the respective compositions (peptides encoded in the minigene). The HTL response is measured using a \n3\nH-thymidine incorporation proliferation assay, (see, \ne.g.\n, \nAlexander et al. Immunity 1:751-761, 1994\n). The results indicate the magnitude of the HTL response, thus demonstrating the \nin vivo\n immunogenicity of the minigene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA minigenes, constructed as described in the previous Example, can also be confirmed as a vaccine in combination with a boosting agent using a prime boost protocol. The boosting agent can consist of recombinant protein (\ne.g.\n, \nBarnett et al., Aids Res. and \n) or recombinant vaccinia, for example, expressing a minigene or DNA encoding the complete protein of interest (see, \ne.g.\n, \nHanke et al., Vaccine 16:439-445, 1998\n; \nSedegah et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 95:7648-53, 1998\n; \nHanke and McMichael, Immunol. Letters 66:177-181, 1999\n; and \nRobinson et al., Nature Med. 5:526-34, 1999\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the efficacy of the DNA minigene used in a prime boost protocol is initially evaluated in transgenic mice. In this example, A2.1/K\nb\n transgenic mice are immunized IM with 100 µg of a DNA minigene encoding the immunogenic peptides including at least one HLA-A2 supermotif-bearing peptide. After an incubation period (ranging from 3-9 weeks), the mice are boosted IP with 10\n7\n pfu/mouse of a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the same sequence encoded by the DNA minigene. Control mice are immunized with 100 µg of DNA or recombinant vaccinia without the minigene sequence, or with DNA encoding the minigene, but without the vaccinia boost. After an additional incubation period of two weeks, splenocytes from the mice are immediately assayed for peptide-specific activity in an ELISPOT assay. Additionally, splenocytes are stimulated \nin vitro\n with the A2-restricted peptide epitopes encoded in the minigene and recombinant vaccinia, then assayed for peptide-specific activity in an alpha, beta and/or gamma IFN ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is found that the minigene utilized in a prime-boost protocol elicits greater immune responses toward the HLA-A2 supermotif peptides than with DNA alone. Such an analysis can also be performed using HLA-A11 or HLA-B7 transgenic mouse models to assess CTL induction by HLA-A3 or HLA-B7 motif or supermotif epitopes. The use of prime boost protocols in humans is described below in the Example entitled \"Induction of CTL Responses Using a Prime Boost Protocol.\"\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolyepitopic Vaccine Compositions from Multiple Antigens\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe PSCA peptide epitopes of the present invention are used in conjunction with epitopes from other target tumor-associated antigens, to create a vaccine composition that is useful for the prevention or treatment of cancer that expresses PSCA and such other antigens. For example, a vaccine composition can be provided as a single polypeptide that incorporates multiple epitopes from PSCA as well as tumor-associated antigens that are often expressed with a target cancer associated with PSCA expression, or can be administered as a composition comprising a cocktail of one or more discrete epitopes. Alternatively, the vaccine can be administered as a minigene construct or as dendritic cells which have been loaded with the peptide epitopes \nin vitro.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nExample 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse of peptides to evaluate an immune response\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptides of the invention may be used to analyze an immune response for the presence of specific antibodies, CTL or HTL directed to PSCA. Such an analysis can be performed in a manner described by \nOgg et al., Science 279:2103-2106, 1998\n. In this Example, peptides in accordance with the invention are used as a reagent for diagnostic or prognostic purposes, not as an immunogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this example highly sensitive human leukocyte antigen tetrameric complexes (\"tetramers\") are used for a cross-sectional analysis of, for example, PSCA HLA-A*0201-specific CTL frequencies from HLA A*0201-positive individuals at different stages of disease or following immunization comprising a PSCA peptide containing an A*0201 motif. Tetrameric complexes are synthesized as described (\nMusey et al., N. Engl, J. Med. 337:1267, 1997\n). Briefly, purified HLA heavy chain (A*0201 in this example) and β2-microglobulin are synthesized by means of a prokaryotic expression system. The heavy chain is modified by deletion of the transmembrane-cytosolic tail and COOH-terminal addition of a sequence containing a BirA enzymatic biotinylation site. The heavy chain, β2-microglobulin, and peptide are refolded by dilution. The 45-kD refolded product is isolated by fast protein liquid chromatography and then biotinylated by BirA in the presence of biotin (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri), adenosine 5' triphosphate and magnesium. Streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate is added in a 1:4 molar ratio, and the tetrameric product is concentrated to 1 mg/ml. The resulting product is referred to as tetramer-phycoerythrin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the analysis of patient blood samples, approximately one million PBMCs are centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes and resuspended in 50 µl of cold phosphate-buffered saline. Tri-color analysis is performed with the tetramer-phycoerythrin, along with anti-CD8-Tricolor, and anti-CD38. The PBMCs are incubated with tetramer and antibodies on ice for 30 to 60 min and then washed twice before formaldehyde fixation. Gates are applied to contain >99.98% of control samples. Controls for the tetramers include both A*0201-negative individuals and A*0201-positive non-diseased donors. The percentage of cells stained with the tetramer is then determined by flow cytometry. The results indicate the number of cells in the PBMC sample that contain epitope-restricted CTLs, thereby readily indicating the extent of immune response to the PSCA epitope, and thus the status of exposure to PSCA, or exposure to a vaccine that elicits a protective or therapeutic response.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInduction of Immune Responses Using a Prime Boost Protocol\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA prime boost protocol similar in its underlying principle to that used to confirm the efficacy of a DNA vaccine in transgenic mice, such as described above in the Example entitled \"The Plasmid Construct and the Degree to Which It Induces Immunogenicity,\" can also be used for the administration of the vaccine to humans. Such a vaccine regimen can include an initial administration of, for example, naked DNA followed by a boost using recombinant virus encoding the vaccine, or recombinant protein/polypeptide or a peptide mixture administered in an adjuvant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the initial immunization may be performed using an expression vector, such as that constructed in the Example entitled \"Construction of \"Minigene\" Multi-Epitope DNA Plasmids\" in the form of naked nucleic acid administered IM (or SC or ID) in the amounts of 0.5-5 mg at multiple sites. The nucleic acid (0.1 to 1000 µg) can also be administered using a gene gun. Following an incubation period of 3-4 weeks, a booster dose is then administered. The booster can be recombinant fowlpox virus administered at a dose of 5-10\n7\n to 5x10\n9\n pfu. An alternative recombinant virus, such as an MVA, canarypox, adenovirus, or adeno-associated virus, can also be used for the booster, or the polyepitopic protein or a mixture of the peptides can be administered. For evaluation of vaccine efficacy, patient blood samples are obtained before immunization as well as at intervals following administration of the initial vaccine and booster doses of the vaccine. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are isolated from fresh heparinized blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation, aliquoted in freezing media and stored frozen. Samples are assayed for CTL and HTL activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis of the results indicates that a magnitude of response sufficient to achieve a therapeutic or protective immunity against PSCA is generated.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplementary Polynucleotides\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSequences complementary to the PSCA-encoding sequences (\nFigure 1\n or \nFigure 3\n), or any parts thereof, are used to detect, decrease, or inhibit expression of naturally occurring PSCA. Although use of oligonucleotides comprising from about 15 to 30 base pairs is described, essentially the same procedure is used with smaller or with larger sequence fragments. Appropriate oligonucleotides are designed using, \ne.g.\n, OLIGO 4.06 software (National Biosciences) and the coding sequence of PSCA. To inhibit transcription, a complementary oligonucleotide is designed from the most unique 5\n1\n sequence and used to prevent promoter binding to the coding sequence. To inhibit translation, a complementary oligonucleotide is designed to prevent ribosomal binding to a PSCA-encoding transcript.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurification of Naturally-occurring or Recombinant PSCA Using PSCA-Specific Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nNaturally occurring or recombinant PSCA is substantially purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using antibodies specific for PSCA. An immunoaffinity column is constructed by covalently coupling anti-PSCA antibody to an activated chromatographic resin, such as CNBr-activated SEPHAROSE (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After the coupling, the resin is blocked and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMedia containing PSCA are passed over the immunoaffinity column, and the column is washed under conditions that allow the preferential absorbance of PSCA (\ne.g.\n, high ionic strength buffers in the presence of detergent). The column is eluted under conditions that disrupt antibody/PSCA binding (\ne.g.\n, a buffer of \npH\n 2 to \npH\n 3, or a high concentration of a chaotrope, such as urea or thiocyanate ion), and GCR.P is collected.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentification of Molecules Which Interact with PSCA\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPSCA, or biologically active fragments thereof, are labeled with 121 1 Bolton-Hunter reagent. (See, \ne.g.\n, \nBolton et al. (1973) Biochem. J. 133:529\n.) Candidate molecules previously arrayed in the wells of a multi-well plate are incubated with the labeled PSCA, washed, and any wells with labeled PSCA complex are assayed. Data obtained using different concentrations of PSCA are used to calculate values for the number, affinity, and association of PSCA with the candidate molecules.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Vivo Assay for PSCA Tumor Growth Promotion\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of the PSCA protein on tumor cell growth is evaluated \nin vivo\n by evaluating tumor development and growth of cells expressing or lacking PSCA. For example, SCID mice are injected subcutaneously on each flank with 1 x 10\n6\n of either 3T3, or prostate cancer cell lines (\ne.g.\n PC3 cells) containing tkNeo empty vector or PSCA. At least two strategies may be used: (1) Constitutive PSCA expression under regulation of a promoter such as a constitutive promoter obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus (\n \nUK 2,211,504 published 5 July 1989\n \n), adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and Simian Virus 40 (SV40), or from heterologous Mammalian promoters, \ne.g.\n, the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems, and (2) Regulated expression under control of an inducible vector system, such as ecdysone, tetracycline, etc., provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems. Tumor volume is then monitored by caliper measurement at the appearance of palpable tumors and followed over time to determine if PSCA-expressing cells grow at a faster rate and whether tumors produced by PSCA-expressing cells demonstrate characteristics of altered aggressiveness (\ne.g.\n enhanced metastasis, vascularization, reduced responsiveness to chemotherapeutic drugs).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, mice can be implanted with 1 x 10\n5\n of the same cells orthotopically to determine if PSCA has an effect on local growth in the prostate, and whether PSCA affects the ability of the cells to metastasize, specifically to lymph nodes, and bone (\nMiki T et al, Oncol Res. 2001;12:209\n; \nFu X et al, Int J Cancer. 1991, 49:938\n). The effect of PSCA on bone tumor formation and growth may be assessed by injecting prostate tumor cells intratibially.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay is also useful to determine the PSCA inhibitory effect of candidate therapeutic compositions, such as for example, PSCA intrabodies, PSCA antisense molecules and ribozymes.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 26\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSCA Monoclonal Antibody-mediated Inhibition of Tumors In Vivo\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe significant expression of PSCA on the cell surface of tumor tissues, together with its restrictive expression in normal tissues makes PSCA a good target for antibody therapy. Similarly, PSCA is a target for T cell-based immunotherapy. Thus, the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PSCA MAbs in human prostate cancer xenograft mouse models and human pancreatic cancer xenograft mouse models is evaluated by using recombinant cell lines such as PC3-PSCA, and 3T3-PSCA (see, \ne.g.\n, \nKaighn, M.E., et al., Invest Urol, 1979. 17(1): 16-23\n), as well as human prostate xenograft models such as LAPC 9AD (\nSaffran et al PNAS 1999, 10:1073-1078\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody efficacy on tumor growth and metastasis formation is studied, \ne.g.\n, in a mouse orthotopic prostate or pancreatic cancer xenograft models. The antibodies can be unconjugated, as discussed in this Example, or can be conjugated to a therapeutic modality, as appreciated in the art. Anti-PSCA MAbs inhibit formation of both pancreatic and prostate xenografts. Anti-PSCA MAbs also retard the growth of established orthotopic tumors and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice. These results indicate the utility of anti-PSCA MAbs in the treatment of local and advanced stages prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and those cancers set forth in Table I. (See, \ne.g.\n, \nSaffran, D., et al., PNAS 10:1073-1078 or world wide web URL pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.051624698\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of the anti-PSCA MAbs led to retardation of established orthotopic tumor growth and inhibition of metastasis to distant sites, resulting in a significant prolongation in the survival of tumor-bearing mice. These studies indicate that PSCA is an attractive target for immunotherapy and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of anti-PSCA MAbs for the treatment of local and metastatic prostate and pancreatic cancer. This example demonstrates that unconjugated PSCA monoclonal antibodies are effective to inhibit the growth of human prostate tumor xenografts grown in SCID mice; accordingly a combination of such efficacious monoclonal antibodies is also effective.\n\n\n \n\n\nTumor inhibition using multiple PSCA MAbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSCA Monoclonal Antibodies:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies were raised against PSCA as described in the Example entitled \"Generation of PSCA Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs).\" The antibodies are characterized by ELISA, Western blot, FACS, and immunoprecipitation for their capacity to bind PSCA. Epitope mapping data for the anti-PSCA MAbs, as determined by ELISA and Western analysis, recognize epitopes on the PSCA protein. Immunohistochemical analysis of prostate cancer tissues and cells with these antibodies is performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies are purified from ascites or hybridoma tissue culture supernatants by Protein-G or Protein-A Sepharose chromatography, dialyzed against PBS, filter sterilized, and stored at -20°C. Protein determinations are performed by a Bradford assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). A therapeutic monoclonal antibody or a cocktail comprising a mixture of individual monoclonal antibodies is prepared and used for the treatment of mice receiving subcutaneous or orthotopic injections of LAPC9 AD and HPAC tumor xenografts.\n\n\n \n\n\nCell Lines and Xenografts\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and LNCaP cell line as well as the fibroblast line NIH 3T3 (American Type Culture Collection) are maintained in RPMI and DMEM respectively, supplemented with L-glutamine and 10% FBS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPC3-PSCAand 3T3-PSCA cell populations are generated by retroviral gene transfer as described in \nHubert, R.S., et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 1999. 96(25): 14523\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe LAPC-9 xenograft, which expresses a wild-type androgen receptor and produces prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is passaged in 6- to 8-week-old male TCR-severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (Taconic Farms) by s.c. trocar implant (\nCraft, N., et al., Nat Med. 1999, 5:280\n). Single-cell suspensions of LAPC-9 tumor cells are prepared as described in Craft, \net al.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nXenograft Mouse Models.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSubcutaneous (s.c.) tumors are generated by injection of 1 x 10\n6\n cancer cells mixed at a 1:1 dilution with Matrigel (Collaborative Research) in the right flank of male SCID mice. To test antibody efficacy on tumor formation, \ni.e.\n antibody injections are started on the same day as tumor-cell injections. As a control, mice are injected with either purified mouse IgG (ICN) or PBS; or a purified monoclonal antibody that recognizes an irrelevant antigen not expressed in human cells. In preliminary studies, no difference is found between mouse IgG or PBS on tumor growth. Tumor sizes are determined by caliper measurements, and the tumor volume is calculated as length x width x height. Mice with Subcutaneous tumors greater than 1.5 cm in diameter are sacrificed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrthotopic injections are performed under anesthesia by using ketamine/xylazine. For prostate orthotopic studies, an incision is made through the abdomen to expose the prostate and LAPC or PC3 tumor cells (2 x 10\n6\n) mixed with Matrigel are injected into the prostate capsule in a 10-µl volume. To monitor tumor growth, mice are palpated and blood is collected on a weekly basis to measure PSA levels. The mice are segregated into groups for the appropriate treatments, with anti-PSCA or control MAbs being injected i.p.\n\n\n \n\n\nAnti-PSCA MAbs Inhibit Growth of PSCA-Expressing Xenograft-Cancer Tumors\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of anti-PSCA MAbs on tumor formation is tested by using HPAC and LAPC9 orthotopic models. As compared with the s.c. tumor model, the orthotopic model, which requires injection of tumor cells directly in the mouse pancreas or prostate, respectively, results in a local tumor growth, development of metastasis in distal sites, deterioration of mouse health, and subsequent death (Saffran, D., \net al.\n, PNAS \nsupra\n). These features make the orthotopic model more representative of human disease progression and allowed us to follow the therapeutic effect of MAbs on clinically relevant end points.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, tumor cells are injected into the mouse prostate, and 2 days later, the mice are segregated into two groups and treated with either: a) 250-1000µg, of anti-PSCA Ab, or b) control antibody three times per week for two to five weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA major advantage of the orthotopic cancer models is the ability to study the development of metastases. Formation of metastasis in mice bearing established orthotopic tumors is studies by IHC analysis on lung sections using an antibody against a tumor-specific cell-surface protein such as anti-CK20 for prostate cancer (\nLin et al., Cancer Detect Prev. (2001) 25:202\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother advantage of xenograft cancer models is the ability to study neovascularization and angiogenesis, Tumor growth is partly dependent on new blood vessel development. Although the capillary system and developing blood network is of host origin, the initiation and architecture of the neovasculature is regulated by the xenograft tumor (\nDavidoff et al., Clin Cancer Res. (2001) 7:2870\n; \nSolesvik et al., Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. (1984) 20:1295\n). The effect of antibody and small molecule on neovascularization is studied in accordance with procedures known in the art, such as by IHC analysis of tumor tissues and their surrounding microenvironment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice bearing established orthotopic tumors are administered injections of either anti-PSCA MAb or Control antibody over a 4-week period. Mice in both groups are allowed to establish a high tumor burden, to ensure a high frequency of metastasis formation in mouse lungs. Mice then are killed and their bladders, livers, bone and lungs are analyzed for the presence of tumor cells by IHC analysis. These studies demonstrate a broad anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PSCA antibodies on initiation and progression of prostate cancer in xenograft mouse models. Anti-PSCA antibodies inhibit tumor formation of tumors as well as retarding the growth of already established tumors and prolong the survival of treated mice. Moreover, anti-PSCA MAbs demonstrate a dramatic inhibitory effect on the spread of local prostate tumor to distal sites, even in the presence of a large tumor burden. Thus, anti-PSCA MAbs are efficacious on major clinically relevant end points (tumor growth), prolongation of survival, and health.\n\n\n \n\n\nEffect of PSCA MAbs on the Growth of Human Prostate Cancer in mice\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing the above methodology, LAPC-9AI tumor cells (2.0 x 10\n6\n cells) were injected subcutaneously into male SCID mice. The mice were randomized into groups (n=10 in each group) and treatment initiated intraperitoneally (i.p.) on \nDay\n 0 with HA1-4.120 or isotype MAb control as indicated. Animals were treated twice weekly for a total of 7 doses until \nstudy day\n 28. Tumor growth was monitored using caliper measurements every 3 to 4 days as indicated. The results show that Human anti-PSCA monoclonal antibody Ha1-4.120 significantly inhibited the growth of human prostate cancer xenografts implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice (p< 0.05) (\nFigure 18\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another experiment, LAPC-9AI tumor cells (2.0 x 10\n6\n cells) were injected subcutaneously into male SCID mice. When tumor volume reached 50 mm3, the mice were randomized into groups (n=10 in each group) and treatment initiated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with HA1-5.99.1 or isotype MAb control as indicated. Animals were treated twice weekly for a total of 5 doses until \nstudy day\n 14. Tumor growth was monitored using caliper measurements every 3 to 4 days as indicated. The results show that Fully human anti-PSCA monoclonal antibody Ha1-5.99 significantly inhibited the growth of established androgen-independent human prostate cancer xenografts implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice (p<0.05). (\nFigure 19\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another experiment, LAPC-9AD tumor cells (2.5 x 106 cells) were injected subcutaneously into male SCID mice. When the tumor volume reached 40 mm3, the mice were randomized into groups (n=10 in each group) and treatment was initiated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with increasing concentrations of HA1-4.121 or isotype MAb control as indicated. Animals were treated twice weekly for a total of 7 doses until \nstudy day\n 21. Tumor growth was monitored using caliper measurements every 3 to 4 days as indicated. The results from this study demonstrated that HA1-4.121 inhibited the growth of established subcutaneous human androgen-dependent prostate xenografts in SCID mice. The results were statistically significant for the 300 ug dose group on \n \ndays\n \n 14, 17 and 21 (p< 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test, two-sided with α=0.05) and for the 700 ug dose group on \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 10, 14, 17 and 21 (p< 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test, two-sided with α=0.05) (\nFigure 20\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another experiment, patient-derived, androgen-dependent, LAPC-9AD tumor cells (2.0 x 106 cells) were injected into the dorsal lobes of the prostates of male SCID mice. The tumors were allowed to grow for approximately 10 days at which time the mice were randomized into groups. Treatment with human 500 mg of HA1-4.117, HA1-4.121 or Isotype control MAb was initiated 10 days after tumor implantation. Antibodies were delivered intraperitoneally two times a week for a total of 7 doses. Four days after the last dose, animals were sacrificed and primary tumors excised and weighed. The results show that Human anti-PSCA monoclonal antibodies Ha1-4.121 (p< 0.01) and Ha1-4.117 (p< 0.05) significantly inhibited the growth of LAPC-9AD prostate cancer xenografts orthotopically implanted in SCID mice (\nFigure 21\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another experiment, Patient-derived, androgen-dependent, LAPC-9AD tumor cells (2.0 x 106 cells) were injected into the dorsal lobes of the prostates of male SCID mice. The tumors were allowed to grow for approximately 9 days at which time the mice were randomized into groups. The animals randomized into the survival groups include 11 mice in the isotype MAb control and 12 mice in the HA1-4.121 treated group. Animals were treated i.p. with 1000 ug Ha1-4.121 or 1000 ug of isotype MAb control twice weekly for a total of 9 doses. The results demonstrated that HA1-4.121 significantly (log-rank test: p<0.01) prolonged the survival of SCID mice with human androgen-dependent prostate tumors. Two mice in the HA1-4.121 treated group remained free of palpable tumors on \nday\n 110, the last day of the experiment (\nFigure 22\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nEffect of PSCA MAbs in combination with Taxotere in mice\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another experiment, LAPC-9AI tumor cells (2 x 10\n6\n cells per animal) were injected subcutaneously into male SCID mice. When the tumor volume reached 65 mm\n3\n, animals were randomized and assigned to four different groups (n=10 in each group) as indicated. Beginning on \nday\n 0, Ha1-4.121 or isotype MAb control were administered i.p. two times a week at a dose of 500 ug for a total of 6 doses. The last dose was given on \nday\n 17. Taxotere was given intravenously at a dose of 5 mg/kg on \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 0, 3 and 7. Tumor growth was monitored every 3-4 days using caliper measurements. The results from this study demonstrate that HA1-4.121 as a single agent inhibited the growth of androgen-independent prostate xenografts in SCID mice by 45% when compared to control antibody treatment alone on day 28 (ANOVA/Tukey test: p<0.05). Administration of the isotype MAb control plus taxotere inhibited tumor growth by 28% when compared to control antibody treatment alone, which was not statistically significant. Administration of HA1-4.121 in combination with Taxotere, enhanced the effect and resulted in a 69% inhibition of tumor growth when compared to control antibody alone (ANOVA/Tukey test: p<0.01). A statistically significant difference was also demonstrated when the HA1-4.121 plus Taxotere combination group was compared to either the HA1-4.121 or isotype MAb control plus Taxotere groups (ANOVA/Tukey test: p<0.05) (\nFigure 23\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nEffect of PSCA MAbs on the Growth of Human Pancreatic Cancer in mice\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another experiment, Human HPAC pancreatic cancer cells (2 x 10\n6\n/ mouse) were injected subcutaneously into immunodeficient ICR SCID mice (Taconic Farm, Germantown, NY). The mice were randomized into groups (n= 10 animals/group) and treatment with the indicated humanPSCA monoclonal antibody initiated the same day. Antibodies (500 mg/mouse) were delivered intraperitoneally two times a week for a total of 8 doses. The results demonstrated that human anti-PSCA monoclonal antibodies Ha1-4.121, Ha1-4.117 and Ha1-1.16 significantly inhibited the growth of human pancreatic cancer xenografts subcutaneously implanted in SCID mice. Statistical analyses were performed using a t test (two-sided, α=0.05) (\nFigure 24\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another experiment, HPAC cells (3.0 x 106 cells) were implanted orthotopically into the pancreata of SCID mice. Mice were randomly assigned to three groups (n=9 in each group) as indicated. Treatment with HA1-4.121 (250 ug or 1000 ug) or isotype MAb control (1000 ug) was initiated on the day of implantation. Antibodies were administered i.p. twice weekly for a total of 10 doses. Thirteen days after the last dose, animals were sacrificed and primary tumors excised and weighed. The results from this study demonstrated that HA1-4.121 significantly inhibited the orthotopic growth of human pancreatic cancer xenografts in SCID mice at both dose levels examined. Treatment with 250 ug and 1000 ug AGS-PSCA inhibited tumor growth by 66% and 70%, respectively (Kruskal-Wallis/Tukey test: p<0.01 and p<0.01, respectively) (\nFigure 25\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt autopsy, visible metastases to lymph nodes and distant organs were observed in the control antibody treated group. No visible metastases were observed in both HA1-4.121 treated groups. Lymph nodes, lungs and livers were removed from all animals and examined histologically for the presence of metastatic tumor. Sections from the lungs and lymph nodes removed from each animal were stained for human cytokeratin and the number of metastases determined microscopically. The results from the histologic analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in lymph node (LN) metastases in animal treated with HA1-4.121 (p= 0.0152 as detected by Fishers exact test). The incidence of metastasis and invasion was also decreased significantly in animals treated with both concentrations of HA1-4.121 (p= 0.0152 as detected by Fishers exact test). The number of lung metastases decreased significantly in mice treated with the 1.0 mg dose of HA1-4.121 only (p= 0.0498 as detected by Fishers exact test) (\nFigure 26\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nEffect of PSCA MAbs on the Growth of Human Bladder Cancer in mice\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another experiment, Human SW780 bladder cancer cells (2 x 10\n6\n/ mouse) were injected subcutaneously into immunodeficient ICR SCID mice (Taconic Farm, Germantown, NY). The mice were randomized into groups (n= 10 animals/group) and treatment with the indicated human PSCA MAb initiated the same day. Antibodies (250 mg/mouse) were delivered intraperitoneally two times a week for a total of 7 doses. The results demonstrated that HA1-4.117 (p= 0.014), HA1-4.37 (p= 0.0056), HA1-1.78 (p= 0.001), Ha1-5.99 (p=0.0002) and HA1-4.5 (p= 0.0008) significanctly inhibited the growth of SW780 bladder tumors implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice. Statistical analyses were performed using at test (two-sided, α=0.05) (\nFigure 27\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of these experiments show that PSCA MAbs can be used for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes to treat and manage cancers set forth in Table I.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 27\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherapeutic and Diagnostic use of Anti-PSCA Antibodies in Humans.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-PSCA monoclonal antibodies are safely and effectively used for diagnostic, prophylactic, prognostic and/or therapeutic purposes in humans. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis of cancer tissues and cancer xenografts with anti-PSCA MAb show strong extensive staining in carcinoma but significantly lower or undetectable levels in normal tissues. Detection of PSCA in carcinoma and in metastatic disease demonstrates the usefulness of the MAb as a diagnostic and/or prognostic indicator. Anti-PSCA antibodies are therefore used in diagnostic applications such as immunohistochemistry of kidney biopsy specimens to detect cancer from suspect patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs determined by flow cytometry, anti-PSCA MAb specifically binds to carcinoma cells. Thus, anti-PSCA antibodies are used in diagnostic whole body imaging applications, such as radioimmunoscintigraphy and radioimmunotherapy, (see, \ne.g.\n, \nPotamianos S., et. al. Anticancer Res 20(2A):925-948 (2000\n)) for the detection of localized and metastatic cancers that exhibit expression of PSCA. Shedding or release of an extracellular domain of PSCA into the extracellular milieu, such as that seen for alkaline phosphodiesterase B10 (\nMeerson, N. R., Hepatology 27:563-568 (1998\n)), allows diagnostic detection of PSCA by anti-PSCA antibodies in serum and/or urine samples from suspect patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-PSCA antibodies that specifically bind PSCA are used in therapeutic applications for the treatment of cancers that express PSCA. Anti-PSCA antibodies are used as an unconjugated modality and as conjugated form in which the antibodies are attached to one of various therapeutic or imaging modalities well known in the art, such as a prodrugs, enzymes or radioisotopes. In preclinical studies, unconjugated and conjugated anti-PSCA antibodies are tested for efficacy of tumor prevention and growth inhibition in the SCID mouse cancer xenograft models, \ne.g.,\n kidney cancer models AGS-K3 and AGS-K6, (see, \ne.g\n., the Example entitled \"PSCA Monoclonal Antibody-mediated Inhibition of Tumors In Vivo\"). Either conjugated and unconjugated anti-PSCA antibodies are used as a therapeutic modality in human clinical trials either alone or in combination with other treatments as described in following Examples.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Clinical Trials for the Treatment and Diagnosis of Human Carcinomas through use of Human Anti-PSCA Antibodies \nIn vivo\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies are used in accordance with the present invention which recognize an epitope on PSCA, and are used in the treatment of certain tumors such as those listed in Table 1. Based upon a number of factors, including PSCA expression levels, tumors such as those listed in Table I are presently preferred indications. In connection with each of these indications, three clinical approaches are successfully pursued.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nI.) Adjunctive therapy: In adjunctive therapy, patients are treated with anti-PSCA antibodies in combination with a chemotherapeutic or antineoplastic agent and/or radiation therapy. Primary cancer targets, such as those listed in Table I, are treated under standard protocols by the addition anti-PSCA antibodies to standard first and second line therapy. Protocol designs address effectiveness as assessed by reduction in tumor mass as well as the ability to reduce usual doses of standard chemotherapy. These dosage reductions allow additional and/or prolonged therapy by reducing dose-related toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent. Anti-PSCA antibodies are utilized in several adjunctive clinical trials in combination with the chemotherapeutic or antineoplastic agents adriamycin (advanced prostrate carcinoma), cisplatin (advanced head and neck and lung carcinomas), taxol (breast cancer), and doxorubicin (preclinical).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nII.) Monotherapy: In connection with the use of the anti-PSCA antibodies in monotherapy of tumors, the antibodies are administered to patients without a chemotherapeutic or antineoplastic agent. In one embodiment, monotherapy is conducted clinically in end stage cancer patients with extensive metastatic disease. Patients show some disease stabilization. Trials demonstrate an effect in refractory patients with cancerous tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIII.) Imaging Agent: Through binding a radionuclide (\ne.g.\n, iodine or yttrium (I\n131\n, Y\n90\n) to anti-PSCA antibodies, the radiolabeled antibodies are utilized as a diagnostic and/or imaging agent. In such a role, the labeled antibodies localize to both solid tumors, as well as, metastatic lesions of cells expressing PSCA. In connection with the use of the anti-PSCA antibodies as imaging agents, the antibodies are used as an adjunct to surgical treatment of solid tumors, as both a pre-surgical screen as well as a post-operative follow-up to determine what tumor remains and/or returns. In one embodiment, a (\n111\nIn)-PSCA antibody is used as an imaging agent in a Phase I human clinical trial in patients having a carcinoma that expresses PSCA (by analogy see, \ne.g.,\n \nDivgi et al. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 83:97-104 (1991\n)). Patients are followed with standard anterior and posterior gamma camera. The results indicate that primary lesions and metastatic lesions are identified.\n\n\n \n\n\nDose and Route of Administration\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, dosing considerations can be determined through comparison with the analogous products that are in the clinic. Thus, anti-PSCA antibodies can be administered with doses in the range of 5 to 400 mg/m\n2\n, with the lower doses used, \ne.g\n., in connection with safety studies. The affinity of anti-PSCA antibodies relative to the affinity of a known antibody for its target is one parameter used by those of skill in the art for determining analogous dose regimens. Further, anti-PSCA antibodies that are fully human antibodies, as compared to the chimeric antibody, have slower clearance; accordingly, dosing in patients with such fully human anti-PSCA antibodies can be lower, perhaps in the range of 50 to 300 mg/m\n2\n, and still remain efficacious. Dosing in mg/m\n2\n, as opposed to the conventional measurement of dose in mg/kg, is a measurement based on surface area and is a convenient dosing measurement that is designed to include patients of all sizes from infants to adults.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree distinct delivery approaches are useful for delivery of anti-PSCA antibodies. Conventional intravenous delivery is one standard delivery technique for many tumors. However, in connection with tumors in the peritoneal cavity, such as tumors of the ovaries, biliary duct, other ducts, and the like, intraperitoneal administration may prove favorable for obtaining high dose of antibody at the tumor and to also minimize antibody clearance. In a similar manner, certain solid tumors possess vasculature that is appropriate for regional perfusion. Regional perfusion allows for a high dose of antibody at the site of a tumor and minimizes short term clearance of the antibody.\n\n\n \n\n\nClinical Development Plan (CDP)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOverview: The CDP follows and develops treatments of anti-PSCA antibodies in connection with adjunctive therapy, monotherapy, and as an imaging agent. Trials initially demonstrate safety and thereafter confirm efficacy in repeat doses. Trails are open label comparing standard chemotherapy with standard therapy plus anti-PSCA antibodies. As will be appreciated, one criteria that can be utilized in connection with enrollment of patients is PSCA expression levels in their tumors as determined by biopsy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs with any protein or antibody infusion-based therapeutic, safety concerns are related primarily to (i) cytokine release syndrome, \ni.e\n., hypotension, fever, shaking, chills; (ii) the development of an immunogenic response to the material (\ni.e\n., development of human antibodies by the patient to the antibody therapeutic, or HAHA response); and, (iii) toxicity to normal cells that express PSCA. Standard tests and follow-up are utilized to monitor each of these safety concerns. Anti-PSCA antibodies are found to be safe upon human administration.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 29\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Clinical Trial: Monotherapy with Human Anti-PSCA Antibody\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-PSCA antibodies are safe in connection with the above-discussed adjunctive trial, a Phase II human clinical trial confirms the efficacy and optimum dosing for monotherapy. Such trial is accomplished, and entails the same safety and outcome analyses, to the above-described adjunctive trial with the exception being that patients do not receive chemotherapy concurrently with the receipt of doses of anti-PSCA antibodies.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 30\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Clinical Trial: Diagnostic Imaging with Anti-PSCA Antibody\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOnce again, as the adjunctive therapy discussed above is safe within the safety criteria discussed above, a human clinical trial is conducted concerning the use of anti-PSCA antibodies as a diagnostic imaging agent. The protocol is designed in a substantially similar manner to those described in the art, such as in \nDivgi et al. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 83:97-104 (1991\n). The antibodies are found to be both safe and efficacious when used as a diagnostic modality.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 31\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Clinical Trial Adjunctive Therapy with Human Anti-PSCA Antibody and Chemotherapeutic, radiation, and/or hormone ablation therapy\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA phase I human clinical trial is initiated to assess the safety of six intravenous doses of a human anti-PSCA antibody in connection with the treatment of a solid tumor, \ne.g\n., a cancer of a tissue listed in Table I. In the study, the safety of single doses of anti-PSCA antibodies when utilized as an adjunctive therapy to an antineoplastic or chemotherapeutic or hormone ablation agent as defined herein, such as, without limitation: cisplatin, topotecan, doxorubicin, adriamycin, taxol, Lupron, Zoladex, Eulexin, Casodex, Anandron or the like, is assessed. The trial design includes delivery of approximately six single doses of an anti-PSCA antibody with dosage of antibody escalating from approximately about 25 mg/m\n2\n to about 275 mg/m\n2\n over the course of the treatment in accordance with the following or similar schedule:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDay\n 0\n \n \nDay\n 7\n \n \nDay\n 14\n \n \nDay\n 21\n \n \nDay\n 28\n \nDay 35\n \n \n \n \n \nMAb Dose\n \n \n25 mg/\nm\n \n \n \n2\n \n \n75 mg/\nm\n \n \n \n2\n \n \n125 mg/m\n2\n \n \n175 mg/m\n2\n \n \n225 mg/m\n2\n \n \n275 mg/m\n2\n \n \n \n \nChemotherapy (standard dose)\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n+\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatients are closely followed for one-week following each administration of antibody and chemotherapy. In particular, patients are assessed for the safety concerns mentioned above: (i) cytokine release syndrome, \ni.e.,\n hypotension, fever, shaking, chills; (ii) the development of an immunogenic response to the material (\ni.e\n., development of human antibodies by the patient to the human antibody therapeutic, or HAHA response); and, (iii) toxicity to normal cells that express PSCA. Standard tests and follow-up are utilized to monitor each of these safety concerns. Patients are also assessed for clinical outcome, and particularly reduction in tumor mass as evidenced by MRI or other imaging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-PSCA antibodies are demonstrated to be safe and efficacious. Phase II trials confirm the efficacy and refine optimum dosing.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 32\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRNA interference (RNA)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nRNA interference (RNAi) technology is implemented to a variety of cell assays relevant to oncology. RNAi is a post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). RNAi induces specific mRNA degradation leading to changes in protein expression and subsequently in gene function. In mammalian cells, these dsRNAs called short interfering RNA (siRNA) have the correct composition to activate the RNAi pathway targeting for degradation, specifically some mRNAs. See, \nElbashir S.M., et al., Duplexes of 21-nucleotide RNAs Mediate RNA interference in Cultured Mammalian Cells, Nature 411(6836):494-8 (2001\n). Thus, RNAi technology is used successfully in Mammalian cells to silence targeted genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLoss of cell proliferation control is a hallmark of cancerous cells; thus, assessing the role of PSCA in cell survival/proliferation assays is relevant. Accordingly, RNAi was used to investigate the function of the PSCA antigen. To generate siRNA for PSCA, algorithms were used that predict oligonucleotides that exhibit the critical molecular parameters (G:C content, melting temperature, etc.) and have the ability to significantly reduce the expression levels of the PSCA protein when introduced into cells. In accordance with this Example, PSCA siRNA compositions are used that comprise siRNA (double stranded, short interfering RNA) that correspond to the nucleic acid ORF sequence of the PSCA protein or subsequences thereof. Thus, siRNA subsequences are used in this manner are generally 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,31, 32, 33, 34, 35 or more than 35 contiguous RNA nucleotides in length. These siRNA sequences are complementary and non-complementary to at least a portion of the mRNA coding sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the subsequences are 19-25 nucleotides in length, most preferably 21-23 nucleotides in length. In preferred embodiments, these siRNA achieve knockdown of PSCA antigen in cells expressing the protein and have functional effects as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe selected siRNA (PSCA.b oligo) was tested in numerous cell lines in the survival/proliferation MTS assay (measures cellular metabolic activity). Tetrazolium-based colorimetric assays (\ni.e\n., MTS) detect viable cells exclusively, since living cells are metabolically active and therefore can reduce tetrazolium salts to colored formazan compounds; dead cells, however do not. Moreover, this PSCA.b oligo achieved knockdown of PSCA antigen in cells expressing the protein and had functional effects as described below using the following protocols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMammalian siRNA transfections: The day before siRNA transfection, the different cell lines were plated in media (RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS w/o antibiotics) at 2x10\n3\n cells/well in 80 µl (96 well plate format) for the survival/MTS assay. In parallel with the PSCA specific siRNA oligo, the following sequences were included in every experiment as controls: a) Mock transfected cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and annealing buffer (no siRNA); b) Luciferase-4 specific siRNA (targeted sequence: 5'-AAGGGACGAAGACGAACACUUCTT-3') (SEQ ID NO:77); and c) Eg5 specific siRNA (targeted sequence: 5'-AACTGAAGACCTGAAGACAATAA-3') (SEQ ID NO:78). SiRNAs were used at 10nM and 1 µg/\nml Lipofectamine\n 2000 final concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe procedure was as follows: The siRNAs were first diluted in OPTIMEM (serum-free transfection media, Invitrogen) at 0.1 uM µM (10-fold concentrated) and incubated 5-10 min RT. \nLipofectamine\n 2000 was diluted at 10 µg/ml (10-fold concentrated) for the total number transfections and incubated 5-10 minutes at room temperature (RT). Appropriate amounts of diluted 10-fold concentrated \nLipofectamine\n 2000 were mixed 1:1 with diluted 10-fold concentrated siRNA and incubated at RT for 20-30\" (5-fold concentrated transfection solution). 20 µls of the 5-fold concentrated transfection solutions were added to the respective samples and incubated at 37°C for 96 hours before analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMTS assay\n: The MTS assay is a colorimetric method for determining the number of viable cells in proliferation, cytotoxicity or chemosensitivity assays based on a tetrazolium compound [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt; MTS(b)] and an electron coupling reagent (phenazine ethosulfate; PES). Assays were performed by adding a small amount of the Solution Reagent directly to culture wells, incubating for 1-4 hours and then recording absorbance at 490nm with a 96-well plate reader. The quantity of colored formazan product as measured by the amount of 490nm absorbance is directly proportional to the mitochondrial activity and/or the number of living cells in culture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to address the function of PSCA in cells, PSCA is silenced by transfecting the endogenously expressing PSCA cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the invention is a method to analyze PSCA related cell proliferation is the measurement of DNA synthesis as a marker for proliferation. Labeled DNA precursors (\ni.e.\n 3H-Thymidine) are used and their incorporation to DNA is quantified. Incorporation of the labeled precursor into DNA is directly proportional to the amount of cell division occurring in the culture. Another method used to measure cell proliferation is performing clonogenic assays. In these assays, a defined number of cells are plated onto the appropriate matrix and the number of colonies formed after a period of growth following siRNA treatment is counted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn PSCA cancer target validation, complementing the cell survival/proliferation analysis with apoptosis and cell cycle profiling studies are considered. The biochemical hallmark of the apoptotic process is genomic DNA fragmentation, an irreversible event that commits the cell to die. A method to observe fragmented DNA in cells is the immunological detection of histone-complexed DNA fragments by an immunoassay (\ni.e\n. cell death detection ELISA) which measures the enrichment of histone-complexed DNA fragments (mono- and oligo-nucleosomes) in the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells. This assay does not require pre-labeling of the cells and can detect DNA degradation in cells that do not proliferate \nin vitro\n (\ni.e.\n freshly isolated tumor cells).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe most important effector molecules for triggering apoptotic cell death are caspases. Caspases are proteases that when activated cleave numerous substrates at the carboxy-terminal site of an aspartate residue mediating very early stages of apoptosis upon activation. All caspases are synthesized as pro-enzymes and activation involves cleavage at aspartate residues. In particular, \ncaspase\n 3 seems to play a central role in the initiation of cellular events of apoptosis. Assays for determination of \ncaspase\n 3 activation detect early events of apoptosis. Following RNAi treatments, Western blot detection of \nactive caspase\n 3 presence or proteolytic cleavage of products (\ni.e\n. PARP) found in apoptotic cells further support an active induction of apoptosis. Because the cellular mechanisms that result in apoptosis are complex, each has its advantages and limitations. Consideration of other criteria/endpoints such as cellular morphology, chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, apoptotic bodies help to further support cell death as apoptotic. Since not all the gene targets that regulate cell growth are anti-apoptotic, the DNA content of permeabilized cells is measured to obtain the profile of DNA content or cell cycle profile. Nuclei of apoptotic cells contain less DNA due to the leaking out to the cytoplasm (sub-G1 population). In addition, the use of DNA stains (\ni.e\n., propidium iodide) also differentiate between the different phases of the cell cycle in the cell population due to the presence of different quantities of DNA in G0/G1, S and G2/M. In these studies the subpopulations can be quantified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the PSCA gene, RNAi studies facilitate the understanding of the contribution of the gene product in cancer pathways. Such active RNAi molecules have use in identifying assays to screen for MAbs that are active anti-tumor therapeutics. Further, siRNA are administered as therapeutics to cancer patients for reducing the malignant growth of several cancer types, including those listed in Table 1. When PSCA plays a role in cell survival, cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, or apoptosis, it is used as a target for diagnostic, prognostic, preventative and/or therapeutic purposes.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection of PSCA protein in cancer patient specimens by IHC\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nExpression of PSCA protein in tumor specimens from cancer patients was detected using the antibody HA1-4.117. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues were cut into 4 micron sections and mounted on glass slides. The sections were dewaxed, rehydrated and treated with antigen retrieval solution (Antigen Retrieval Citra Solution; BioGenex, 4600 Norris Canyon Road, San Ramon, CA, 94583) at high temperature. Sections were then incubated in fluorescein conjugated human monoclonal anti-PSCA antibody, Ha1-4.117, for 16 hours at 4°C. The slides were washed three times in buffer and further incubated with Rabbit anti-Fluorescein for 1 hour and, after washing in buffer, immersed in DAKO EnVision+™ peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin secondary antibody (DAKO Corporation, Carpenteria, CA) for 30 minutes. The sections were then washed in buffer, developed using the DAB kit (SIGMA Chemicals), counterstained using hematoxylin, and analyzed by bright field microscopy. The results show expression of PSCA in the tumor cells of prostate adenocarcinoma (A, B), bladder transitional carcinoma (C) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (D). These results indicate that PSCA is expressed in human cancers and that antibodies directed to this antigen are useful as diagnostic reagents (\nFigure 17\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese results indicate that PSCA is a target for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic applications in cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout this application, various website data content, publications, patent applications and patents are referenced.
