To date there is no effective treatment for SMA. This disease is caused by mutations that reduce the level of survival motor neuron protein (SMN), resulting in the loss of motor neurons in the central nervous system. Drugs that increase SMN expression are expected to be useful in the prevention and treatment of SMA. Prior studies in cultured cells have shown that indoprofen, a previously marketed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), increases the level of expression of SMN protein via an unknown mechanism (Lunn et al., \nChem\n. & \nBiol., \n11, 1489-1493(2004)). Indoprofen also was shown to increase survival of SMA model mouse fetuses when administered in utero. The mechanism of regulation of SMN expression is not thought to be related to indoprofen's NSAID activity since not all of the NSAIDs tested increase SMN expression. One possible mechanism of action is increased protein translation, as it has been shown that the level of the SMN protein can be improved by drugs that cause translational read-through of nonsense stop codons (Wolstencroft et al., \nHum. Mol. Genet., \n14, 1199-210 (2005)). However, indoprofen is not a useful drug for SMA because it is only weakly active in increasing SMN expression, does not enter the brain at sufficient levels, and has lethal side effects due, at least in part, to its cyclooxygenase (Cox) inhibitory activity.\n\n\nAccordingly, there is a need for new compounds, compositions, and methods that can address some of these problems.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention provides compounds of Formula I or II:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe invention also provides related compounds, as well as methods for making the compounds of the invention, and compositions, especially pharmaceutical compositions, comprising one or more compounds of the invention and a carrier.\n\n\nThe invention further provides a method of increasing SMN expression in a cell comprising administering a compound of the invention to a cell comprising a nucleic acid encoding SMN2, whereby expression of SMN is increased.\n\n\nThe invention additionally provides a method of increasing the expression of excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT2) in a cell comprising administering a compound of the invention to a cell comprising a nucleic acid that encodes EAAT2, whereby expression of EAAT2 is increased.\n\n\nAlso provided by the invention is a method of increasing in a cell the expression of a nucleic acid that encodes a translational stop codon, the method comprising administering a compound of the invention to a cell comprising a nucleic acid that encodes a translational stop codon, whereby expression of the nucleic acid is increased.\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention provides compounds of Formula I or II:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein,\n\n\nW is selected from the

Suitable anticancer agents include, without limitation, alkylating agents; nitrogen mustards; folate antagonists; purine antagonists; pyrimidine antagoinists; spindle poisons; topoisomerase inhibitors; apoptosis inducing agents; angiogenesis inhibitors; podophyllotoxins; nitrosoureas; cisplatin; carboplatin; interferon; asparginase; tamoxifen; leuprolide; flutamide; megestrol ; mitomycin; bleomycin; doxorubicin; irinotecan; and taxol. Other antibiotics include macrolides (e.g., tobramycin), cephalosporins (e.g., cephalexin, cephradine, cefuroxime, cefprozil, cefaclor, cefixime, or cefadroxil), clarithromycin, erythromycin, penicillins (e.g., penicillin V), and quinolones (e. g., ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, or norfloxacin).\n\n\nThe composition further comprises a carrier. The carrier can be any suitable carrier. Preferably, the carrier is a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. With respect to pharmaceutical compositions, the carrier can be any of those conventionally used and is limited only by physio-chemical considerations, such as solubility and lack of reactivity with the active compound(s), and by the route of administration. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that, in addition to the following described pharmaceutical composition, the compounds and inhibitors of the present inventive methods can be formulated as inclusion complexes, such as cyclodextrin inclusion complexes, or liposomes.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutically acceptable carriers described herein, for example, vehicles, adjuvants, excipients, and diluents, are well-known to those skilled in the art and are readily available to the public. It is preferred that the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier be one which is chemically inert to the active agent(s) and one which has no detrimental side effects or toxicity under the conditions of use.\n\n\nThe choice of carrier will be determined in part by the particular compound of the invention and other active agents or drugs used, as well as by the particular method used to administer the compound and/or inhibitor. Accordingly, there are a variety of suitable formulations of the pharmaceutical composition of the present inventive methods. The following formulations for oral, aerosol, parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, interperitoneal, rectal, and vaginal administration are exemplary and are in no way limiting. One skilled in the art will appreciate that these routes of administering the compound of the invention are known, and, although more than one route can be used to administer a particular compound, a particular route can provide a more immediate and more effective response than another route.\n\n\nInjectable formulations are among those formulations that are preferred in accordance with the present invention. The requirements for effective pharmaceutical carriers for injectable compositions are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art (See, e.g., Pharmaceutics and Pharmacy Practice, J.B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, Pa., Banker and Chalmers, eds., pages 238-250 (1982), and ASHP Handbook on Injectable Drugs, Toissel, 4th ed., pages 622-630 (1986)).\n\n\nTopical formulations are well-known to those of skill in the art. Such formulations are particularly suitable in the context of the present invention for application to the skin.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for oral administration can consist of (a) liquid solutions, such as an effective amount of the inhibitor dissolved in diluents, such as water, saline, or orange juice; (b) capsules, sachets, tablets, lozenges, and troches, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as solids or granules; (c) powders; (d) suspensions in an appropriate liquid; and (e) suitable emulsions. Liquid formulations may include diluents, such as water and alcohols, for example, ethanol, benzyl alcohol, and the polyethylene alcohols, either with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant. Capsule forms can be of the ordinary hard- or soft-shelled gelatin type containing, for example, surfactants, lubricants, and inert fillers, such as lactose, sucrose, calcium phosphate, and corn starch. Tablet forms can include one or more of lactose, sucrose, mannitol, corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid, microcrystalline cellulose, acacia, gelatin, guar gum, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, stearic acid, and other excipients, colorants, diluents, buffering agents, disintegrating agents, moistening agents, preservatives, flavoring agents, and pharmacologically compatible excipients. Lozenge forms can comprise the active ingredient in a flavor, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, as well as pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia, emulsions, gels, and the like containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such excipients as are known in the art.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention, alone or in combination with other suitable components, can be made into aerosol formulations to be administered via inhalation. These aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized acceptable propellants, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the like. They also may be formulated as pharmaceuticals for non-pressured preparations, such as in a nebulizer or an atomizer. Such spray formulations also may be used to spray mucosa.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions, which can contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. The compounds of the invention can be administered in a physiologically acceptable diluent in a pharmaceutical carrier, such as a sterile liquid or mixture of liquids, including water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, an alcohol, such as ethanol, isopropanol, or hexadecyl alcohol, glycols, such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, dimethylsulfoxide, glycerol ketals, such as 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol, ethers, such as poly(ethyleneglycol) 400, an oil, a fatty acid, a fatty acid ester or glyceride, or an acetylated fatty acid glyceride with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant, such as a soap or a detergent, suspending agent, such as pectin, carbomers, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, or carboxymethylcellulose, or emulsifying agents and other pharmaceutical adjuvants.\n\n\nOils, which can be used in parenteral formulations include petroleurn, animal, vegetable, or synthetic oils. Specific examples of oils include peanut, soybean, sesame, cottonseed, corn, olive, petrolatum, and mineral. Suitable fatty acids for use in parenteral formulations include oleic acid, stearic acid, and isostearic acid. Ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate are examples of suitable fatty acid esters.\n\n\nSuitable soaps for use in parenteral formulations include fatty alkali metal, ammonium, and triethanolamine salts, and suitable detergents include (a) cationic detergents such as, for example, dimethyl dialkyl ammonium halides, and alkyl pyridinium halides, (b) anionic detergents such as, for example, alkyl, aryl, and olefin sulfonates, alkyl, olefin, ether, and monoglyceride sulfates, and sulfosuccinates, (c) nonionic detergents such as, for example, fatty amine oxides, fatty acid alkanolamides, and polyoxyethylenepolypropylene copolymers, (d) amphoteric detergents such as, for example, alkyl-b-aminopropionates, and 2-alkyl-imidazoline quaternary ammonium salts, and (e) mixtures thereof.\n\n\nThe parenteral formulations will typically contain from about 0.5% to about 25% by weight of the active ingredient in solution. Preservatives and buffers may be used. In order to minimize or eliminate irritation at the site of injection, such compositions may contain one or more nonionic surfactants having a hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) of from about 12 to about 17. The quantity of surfactant in such formulations will typically range from about 5% to about 15% by weight. Suitable surfactants include polyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, such as sorbitan monooleate and the high molecular weight adducts of ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic base, formed by the condensation of propylene oxide with propylene glycol. The parenteral formulations can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampoules and vials, and can be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid excipient, for example, water, for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind previously described.\n\n\nAdditionally, the compounds of the invention, or compositions comprising such compounds, can be made into suppositories by mixing with a variety of bases, such as emulsifying bases or water-soluble bases. Formulations suitable for vaginal administration can be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams, or spray formulas containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.\n\n\nOne of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the compounds of the invention described herein can be modified in any number of ways to increase the therapeutic efficacy of the compound. For instance, the compound or inhibitor could be conjugated either directly or indirectly through a linker to a targeting moiety. The practice of conjugating compounds or inhibitors to targeting moieties is known in the art. The term “targeting moiety” as used herein, refers to any molecule or agent that specifically recognizes and binds to a cell-surface receptor, such that the targeting moiety directs the delivery of the compound or inhibitor to a population of cells on which surface the receptor is expressed. Targeting moieties include, but are not limited to, antibodies, or fragments thereof, peptides, hormones, growth factors, cytokines, and any other naturally- or non-naturally-existing ligands, which bind to cell surface receptors. The term “linker” as used herein, refers to any agent or molecule that bridges the compound or inhibitor to the targeting moiety. One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that sites on the compounds or inhibitors, which are not necessary for the function of the compound or inhibitor, are ideal sites for attaching a linker and/or a targeting moiety, provided that the linker and/or targeting moiety, once attached to the compound or inhibitor, do(es) not interfere with the function of the compound or inhibitor.\n\n\nAlternatively, the compounds of the invention described herein can be modified into a depot form, such that the manner in which the compound of the invention is released into the body to which it is administered is controlled with respect to time and location within the body (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,450,150). Depot forms of compounds or inhibitors can be, for example, an implantable composition comprising the compound or inhibitor and a porous material, such as a polymer, wherein the compound or inhibitor is encapsulated by or diffused throughout the porous material. The depot is then implanted into the desired location within the body and the compound or inhibitor is released from the implant at a predetermined rate by diffusing through the porous material.\n\n\nIn some contexts, the compounds of the invention can be advantageously administered via an implanted pump that allows intrathecal delivery. Such a delivery method is especially useful for delivery of drugs to the CNS when the drugs administered do not otherwise sufficiently penetrate the blood-brain barrier.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention described herein can be administered to a cell in vitro. As used herein, the term “in vitro” means that the cell is not in a living organism. The compounds of the invention also can be administered to a cell in vivo. As used herein, the term “in vivo” means that the cell is a part of a living organism or is the living organism. Furthermore, the compounds of the invention can be administered to a host in vivo or ex vivo. The term “ex vivo” as used herein refers to the administration of a compound to a cell or a population of cells in vitro, followed by administration of the cell or population of cells to a host.\n\n\nFurthermore, the compounds of the invention or composition comprising one or more of the compounds can be administered alone, or in conjunction with of an agent that enhances the efficacy of the compounds of the invention. Such agents can include, for instance, any of the other active agents described herein with respect to the pharmaceutical composition, which agents can be administered in a composition separate from the composition comprising the compounds of the invention.\n\n\nThe amount or dose of the compounds of the invention should be sufficient to effect a therapeutic or prophylactic response in the host over a reasonable time frame. The appropriate dose will depend upon the nature and severity of the disease or affliction to be treated or prevented, as well as by other factors. For instance, the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature and extent of any adverse side effects that might accompany the administration of a particular compound or inhibitor. Ultimately, the attending physician will decide the dosage of the compound or inhibitor of the present invention with which to treat each individual patient, taking into consideration a variety of factors, such as age, body weight, general health, diet, sex, inhibitor to be administered, route of administration, and the severity of the condition being treated. Typically doses might be, for example, 0.1 mg to 1 g daily, such as 5 mg to 500 mg daily.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention can be administered to a cell, preferably to a cell of a host. Hosts include, for example, bacteria, yeast, fungi, plants, and mammals. Preferably, the host is a mammal. For purposes of the present invention, mammals include, but are not limited to, the order Rodentia, such as mice, and the order Logomorpha, such as rabbits. It is preferred that the mammals are from the order Carnivora, including Felines (cats) and Canines (dogs). It is more preferred that the mammals are from the order Artiodactyla, including Bovines (cows) and Swines (pigs) or of the order Perssodactyla, including Equines (horses). It is most preferred that the mammals are of the order Primates, Ceboids, or Simoids (monkeys) or of the order Anthropoids (humans and apes). An especially preferred mammal is the human. Furthermore, the host can be the unborn offspring of any of the forgoing hosts, especially mammals or humans, in which case any screening of the host or cells of the host, or administration of compounds to the host or cells of the host, can be performed in utero.\n\n\nThe compounds can be used for any purpose including, without limitation, the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a disease or condition, the screening of compounds that can be used to treat, prevent, or diagnose a disease or condition, or the research of the underlying mechanisms or causes of a disease or condition, which research can be used, for example, in the development of methods to treat, prevent, or diagnose the disease or condition. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the compounds of the invention are particularly useful with respect to diseases and conditions involving the under-expression of survival motor neuron protein (SMN), diseases and conditions that can be ameliorated by modulation of translational stop codons (e.g., UAA, UAG, UGA; both normal, naturally occurring and mutation introduced stop codons), and diseases and conditions associated with elevated glutamate levels in the central nervous system (CNS) and/or that could be ameliorated by increases in EAAT2 expression.\n\n\nPreferred compounds of the invention can be used to increase SMN expression in a cell that comprises an SMN2 gene, particularly a cell that does not comprise an SMN1 gene, or that comprises a defective or deleted SMN1 gene. Thus, one aspect of the invention provides a method of increasing SMN expression in a cell comprising administering a compound of the invention to a cell comprising a nucleic acid that encodes SMN2, desirably a cell that comprises a defective or deleted SMN1 gene, whereby SMN expression is increased.\n\n\nSMN1 and SMN2 refer to two different genes that each encode SMN protein, but that differ by a single base pair. The base pair change in SMN2 results in decreased expression of SMN due to an alternative splicing mechanism that results in an unstable protein that is missing exon 7. As a result, SMN2 transcripts typically are not properly expressed, and SMN protein is produced primarily by SMN1. Most patients that exhibit under-expression of SMN have a defective or mutant SMN1 gene, but an intact SMN2 gene. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the compounds of the invention increase the expression of SMN2 via a post-transcriptional mechanism, possibly by increasing translation or otherwise suppressing the effects of translational stop codons introduced by improper splicing of the SMN2 transcript.\n\n\nThe increase in expression of SMN after administration of a compound of the invention can be any increase as compared to the expression level of SMN in the cell in the absence of the compound of the invention. Typically, the cell will have a defective or mutant SMN1 protein and/or reduced levels of SMN protein expression in the absence of a compound of the invention. Methods for detecting and measuring increased SMN expression, particularly through expression of SMN2, are known in the art and described herein.\n\n\nThe cell to which the compound of the invention is administered preferably is in a host. Suitable hosts are as previously described herein. The host is desirably a mammal, especially a human. The method of this aspect of the invention is most suitable for use in conjunction with a host that is afflicted with a disease or at risk for developing a disease, such as a disease associated with the under-expression of SMN. Such diseases include, for example, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Preferably, one or more symptoms of the disease are prevented, reduced, or eliminated subsequent to administration of the compound of the invention, thereby effectively treating or preventing the disease to at least some degree. Accordingly, the method of the invention can be used to treat or prevent such a disease.\n\n\nIn a related aspect, the invention provides a method of increasing in a cell the expression of a nucleic acid that encodes a translational stop codon. The stop codon can be a normally occurring stop codon, or a stop codon introduced by mutation or frameshift, particularly a nonsense stop codon. The method comprises administering a compound of the invention to a cell comprising a nucleic acid that encodes a translational stop codon, whereby expression of the nucleic acid is increased. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the compounds of the invention permit translational (ribosomal) read-through of stop codons, especially those introduced by mutation or frameshift. According to a preferred aspect of the invention, the stop codon is one that is introduced by a mutation of frameshift, and the compound of the invention permits translational read-through of the stop codon, preferably without interfering with the effect of normal stop codons (e.g., stop codons not introduced by mutation or frameshift, which do not interfere with the production of a full-length protein). The compounds, thus, increase expression of the protein products of such nucleic acids. Compounds of the invention may also modulate gene expression through effects on naturally occurring stop codons.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “translational stop codon introduced by mutation or frameshift” means any stop codon that results in the premature or otherwise unusual termination of translation and consequential production of a truncated gene product or protein. Translational stop codons introduced by mutation or frameshift include, for example, those that result in a gene product that has reduced stability or reduced activity (or no activity) as compared to the normal, full-length protein product, or results in the reduction or complete absence of a protein product. Translational stop codons introduced by mutation or frameshift also include, for example, those that result in a mRNA that is a target of non-sense-mediated RNA decay. The translational stop codon can be present in the DNA or RNA of any type of cell, and can arise through any type of mutagenesis or frameshift event. For example, the nucleic acid that encodes the translational stop codon can be, without limitation, a defective SMN1 gene or a defective or normal SMN2 gene, or any transcript thereof. In particular, the alternative splicing event that occurs during SMN2 expression, which results in the deletion of SMN exon 7, also creates a nonsense stop codon. The nucleic acid comprising the stop codon can be endogenous to the cell, or a nucleic acid introduced into the cell, for example, by a virus. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the compounds of the invention can increase expression of SMN by suppressing the effects of the nonsense stop codons, possibly by allowing translational read-through of the stop codon or by suppressing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.\n\n\nAn appropriate screening assay can be employed to determine whether a cell or host comprises a nucleic acid that encodes a translational stop codon introduced by mutation or frameshift. For instance, the DNA or RNA of a cell (e.g., a cell of a host or an organism that is pathogenic to the host) can be sequenced or subject to Southern Blot, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), use of the Short Tandem Repeat (STR), or polymorphic length restriction fragments (RFLP) analysis to determine if a nonsense mutation is present. Alternatively, it can be determined if a cell (e.g., a cell of a host) expresses altered levels of a protein encoded by the nucleic acid using western blot or other immunoassays. Other methods of determining whether a nucleic acid that encodes a premature translational stop codon are available.\n\n\nThe cell to which the compound of the invention is administered preferably is in a host. Suitable hosts are as previously described herein. The host is desirably a mammal, especially a human.\n\n\nThe method of this aspect of the invention is most suitable for use in conjunction with a host that is afflicted with a disease, or at risk for developing a disease, associated with a translational stop codon introduced by mutation or frameshift. The types of diseases associated with translational stop codons introduced by mutation or frameshift, the symptoms of which can be ameliorated by the suppression of premature translation termination and/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, include, but are not limited to, genetic diseases, autoimmune diseases, blood diseases, collagen diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, proliferative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, inflammatory diseases, central nervous system diseases, infectious diseases (bacterial and viral), cancers (including tumors and other cancers), especially cancers associated with p53 mutations.\n\n\nSpecific examples of genetic diseases include, without limitation, SMA, amyloidosis, hemophilia, Alzheimer's disease, Tay Sachs disease, Niemann Pick disease, atherosclerosis, giantism, dwarfism, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, aging, obesity, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, heart disease, kidney stones, ataxia-telangiectasia, familial hypercholesterolemia, retinitis pigmentosa, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Marfan syndrome.\n\n\nSpecific examples of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases include, without limitation, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and graft versus host disease. Specific examples of blood diseases include, without limitation, hemophilia, Von Willebrand disease, ataxia-telangiectasia, thalassemia (e.g., β-thalassemia), and kidney stones.\n\n\nSpecific examples of blood diseases include, without limitation, hemophilia, Von Willebrand disease, ataxia-telangiectasia, thalassemia (e.g., β-thalassemia), and kidney stones.\n\n\nSpecific examples of collagen diseases include, without limitation, osteogenesis imperfecta and cirrhosis.\n\n\nSpecific examples of central nervous system diseases include, without limitation, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's Disease, Tay Sachs disease, late infantile neuronal ceroidlipofuscinosis (LINCL), Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, and Parkinson's disease.\n\n\nSpecific examples of infectious diseases include, without limitation, HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, HPV infection, and \nPseudomonas aeruginosa \ninfection.\n\n\nSpecific examples of cancers include cancer of the head and neck, eye, skin, mouth, throat, esophagus, chest, bone, lung, colon, sigmoid, rectum, stomach, prostate, breast, ovaries, kidney, liver, pancreas, brain, intestine, heart or adrenals. More particularly, cancers include include solid tumor, sarcoma, carcinomas, fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendothelio sarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, testicular tumor, lung carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodendroglioma, menangioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, a blood-born tumor, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic B-cell leukemia, acute lymphoblastic T-cell leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute promyelocytic leukemia, acute monoblastic leukemia, acute erythroleukemic leukemia, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, acute myelomonocytic leukemia, acutenonlymphocyctic leukemia, acute undifferentiated leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, or multiple myeloma. See, e.g., Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, Eugene Braunwald et al., eds., pp. 491 762 (15th ed. 2001).\n\n\nDiseases, such as cancers, associated with p53 mutations that result in a translational stop codon include, but are not limited to, the diseases and mutations described in Masuda et al., \nTokai J Exp Clin Med. \n25 (2): 69-77 (2000); Oh et al., \nMol Cells \n10 (3): 275-80 (2000); Li et al., \nLab Invest. \n80 (4): 493-9 (2000); Yang et al., \nZhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi \n21 (2):114-8 (1999); Finkelstein et al., \nMol Diagn. \n3(1): 37-41 (1998); Kajiyama et al., \nDis Esophagus. \n11 (4): 279-83 (1998); Kawamura et al., \nLeuk Res. \n23 (2): 115-26 (1999); Radig et al., \nHum Pathol. \n29 (11): 1310-6 (1998); Schuyer et al., \nInt J Cancer \n76 (3): 299-303 (1998); Wang-Gohrke et al., \nOncol Rep. \n5(1): 65-8 (1998); Fulop et al., \nJ Reprod Med. \n43 (2): 119-27 (1998); Ninomiya et al., \nJ Dermatol Sci. \n14 (3):173-8 (1997); Hsieh et al., \nCancer Lett. \n100 (1-2): 107-13 (1996); Rall et al., \nPancreas. \n12(1): 10-7 (1996); Fukutomi et al., \nNipponRinsho \n53 (11): 2764-8 (1995); Frebourg et al., \nAm J Hum Genet. \n56 (3): 608-15 (1995); Dove et al., \nCancer Surv. \n25: 335-55 (1995); Adamson et al., \nBr J Haematol. \n89(1): 61-6 (1995); Grayson et al., \nAm J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. \n16 (4): 341-7 (1994); Lepelley et al., \nLeukemia \n8 (8): 1342-9 (1994); McIntyre et al., \nJ Clin Oncol. \n12 (5): 925-30 (1994); Horio et al., \nOncogene. \n9 (4): 1231-5 (1994); Nakamura et al., \nJpn J Cancer Res. \n83 (12): 1293-8 (1992); Davidoff et al., \nOncogene. \n7(1): 127-33 (1992); and Ishioka et al., \nBiochem Biophys Res Commun. \n177 (3): 901-6 (1991).\n\n\nPreferably, one or more symptoms of the disease are prevented, reduced, or eliminated subsequent to administration of the compound of the invention, thereby effectively treating or preventing the disease to at least some degree. Accordingly, the method of the invention can be used to treat or prevent such a disease.\n\n\nIn yet another related aspect, the invention provides a method of increasing the expression of excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT2) in a cell comprising administering a compound of the invention to a cell comprising a nucleic acid that encodes EAAT2, whereby expression of EAAT2 is increased. Certain diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and epilepsy) and other conditions, such as stroke or other trauma to the CNS, are associated with elevated glutamate levels in the CNS that can be toxic, leading to brain damage or even death. Cellular uptake of glutamate via the EAAT2 transporter is responsible, at least in part, for maintaining appropriately low glutamate levels in the CNS. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the compounds of the invention can activate or enhance EAAT2 expression, thereby advantageously lowering glutamate levels in the CNS. Methods of detecting and measuring increased EAAT2 expression are known in the art and described, for instance, in Rothstein et al., \nNature, \n43(3), 73-7 (2005).\n\n\nThe cell to which the compound of the invention is administered preferably is in a host. Suitable hosts are as previously described herein. The host is desirably a mammal, especially a human. The method of this aspect of the invention is most suitable for use in conjunction with a host that is afflicted with a disease or condition, or at risk for developing a disease or condition, associated with decreased expression of EAAT2 or elevated glutamate levels in the CNS. Such diseases and conditions include, for example, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), epilepsy, stroke, and other forms of CNS trauma. Preferably, one or more symptoms of the disease or condition are prevented, reduced, or eliminated subsequent to administration of the compound of the invention, thereby effectively treating or preventing the disease or condition to at least some degree. Accordingly, the method of the invention can be used to treat or prevent such a disease or condition.\n\n\nIn addition to the foregoing characteristics, preferred compounds of the invention are able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier so as to accumulate in therapeutically effective amounts, and do not have significant cyclooxygenase (Cox) inhibitory activity (e.g., has less than toxic levels of Cox inhibitory activity).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSMN Splice Reporter Assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(Example

Therefore, SMN2 provides a potential means of increasing SMN production in SMA patients and is, thus, a target for developing SMA treatments. SMN2 is identical to SMN1 with the exception of a single base pair change that results in reduced expression of the gene. The reduction is based on the creation of an alternatively spliced RNA that produces an unstable protein carrying a deletion of exon 7. Both full length SMN and exon 7 deleted SMN are produced by the SMN2 gene via alternative RNA splicing, but the major product is the unstable deleted form.\n\n\nCervical carcinoma cell lines were transformed with a SMN2-linked luciferase-reporter gene construct. The reporter is designed to detect shifts in the alternative splicing of SMN2 sequences. In particular, the reporter is constructed as a fusion of the alternatively spliced sequences of the SMN2 gene and the luciferase gene. Luciferase sequences are in the correct translational reading frame only when the SMN2 sequences are spliced according to the normal SMN1 mechanism (e.g., splicing to include exon 7), which allows for translation of the stable SMN protein. Compounds were tested in the assay by administering the compound to the cell line and detecting an increase in the luciferase activity. The assay is described in greater detail in Zhang et al., \nGene Ther., \n8, 1532-8 (2001). Compounds were administered as described in Lunn et al, \nChem\n. & \nBiol, \n11, 1489-1493 (2004).\n\n\nThe compounds tested and the results are reported in Table 1. The results are reported as a fold-increase over a baseline reading of transformed cells without any test compound. The EC50 value also is reported in Table I for some compounds.\n\n\nIndoprofen increases luciferase activity in this assay. Although this assay is designed to detect correction of the SMN2 splicing defect, it is known that indoprofen does not increase luciferase expression in this assay via effects on splicing. Nonetheless, the effects of indoprofen detected in this assay have been shown to extend to an increase in production of SMN from the endogenous SMN2 gene in SMA patient fibroblasts.\n\n\nMany of the tested compounds increased luciferase activity in the assay, indicating that the compounds of the invention can be used to increase expression of SMN from the endogenous SMN2 gene.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 11\n\n\nThis example demonstrates the ability of compounds of the invention to increase GEMs in fibroblasts from SMA patients.\n\n\nSMN protein can be found in punctate nuclear particles called “gems” (Liu and Dreyfuss, \nEMBO J. \n15(14): 3555-3565 (1996)). In fibroblast cells derived from SMA patients, the number of gems corresponds to disease severity as follows: severe type 1 patients have approximately 5 gems per 100 nuclei; mild type 3 patients have 20-50 gems per 100 nuclei; normal individuals have approximately 100-150 gems per 100 nuclei (Coovert et al., \nHum Mol Genet \n6(8): 1205-1214 (1997), Young et al., \nExp Cell Res \n265(2): 252-261 (2001)).\n\n\nGems are detectable by immunohistochemistry and gem counts in patient fibroblasts have been used to test the ability of compounds to increase SMN protein levels (Mattis et al., \nHum Genet \n120:589-601 (2006)). Following these methods, fibroblast cells from a type 1 SMA patient (3813 cells, Coriell Cell Repositories) were treated for 48 hours with the compounds indicated in Table 2 (reference number—structure correlation is provided in Table 1). The cells were then fixed and incubated with a monoclonal antibody against SMN (4B7, Wolstencroft et al., \nHum Mol Genet \n14:1199-1210 (2005)). A FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody was used to visualize the labeled gems. The positive control in these experiments was provided by fibroblasts from the same patient treated with 1000 μM valproic acid. The results are presented in Table 4.\n\n\nAs the results in Table 4 show, treatment of the cells with each of the compounds increased the number of SMN-containing gems in patient fibroblasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNumber of gems per 100 nuclei\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConcentration\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPositive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\nTreated Cells\n\n\nUntreated Cells\n\n\nControl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALB-112355\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n5.3\n\n\n2\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALB-115806\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n8\n\n\n2\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALB-113310\n\n\n3\n\n\n53.5\n\n\n4.75\n\n\n48.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALB-115069\n\n\n1\n\n\n45.25\n\n\n4.75\n\n\n48.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALB-115498\n\n\n1\n\n\n14.3\n\n\n2\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALB-116244\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n44\n\n\n4.67\n\n\n38.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 12\n\n\nThe following example demonstrates that compounds of the invention can increase activation of the glutamate transporter promoter.\n\n\nThe astroglial glutamate transporter, GLT-1/EAAT-2, is responsible for the majority of glutamate transport in the brain and spinal cord. To identify compounds capable of inducing EAAT-2 expression, we used a cell-based reporter assay consisting of COS-7 cells stably transfected with a plasmid containing at 2.7 Kb fragment of the human GLT-1/EAAT-2 promoter driving expression of the luciferase reporter (Rothstein et al., \nNature \n433:73-77 (2005). The cell isolate used is designated Cos7 pE2P-GL3 (clone 4). Cells were incubated with compound at the indicated concentrations for 48 h prior to measuring luciferase reporter activity using the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Luminescence was measured using a Wallac Trilux microplate luminometer. Results from each plate were normalized to the DMSO treated control wells and expressed as fold-induction. EC\n50 \nvalues were calculated using GraphPad Prism software. The results are presented in Table 5.\n\n\nThe results show that some tested compounds significantly increased glutamate transporter promoter activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound ID\n\n\nMax Fold-Induction\n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPositive Control\n\n\n1.61\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nALB-112354\n\n\n1.93\n\n\n221.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nALB-112171\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n459.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nALB-113968\n\n\n1.78\n\n\n1266\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nALB-116361\n\n\n1.54\n\n\n6.79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nALB-116255\n\n\n1.2\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nALB-116486\n\n\n1.17\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nALB-115806\n\n\n0.87\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nALB-115498\n\n\n0.86\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 13\n\n\nThis example demonstrates the use of compounds of the invention to promote translational read-through of a stop condon.\n\n\nThis assay is described in detail in WO 01/44516 A2. This is a cell-based luciferase reporter assay designed to detect translational read-through via insertion of a translational stop codon within the luciferase coding sequence. In the presence of compounds that promote read-through of translational stop codons, active luciferase is produced and detected via chemiluminescence. We have shown that indoprofen analogs are active in two versions of this assay—one containing a UGA stop codon and one containing a UAG stop codon. The data in the table is from the luciferase reporter containing the UAG stop codon. This is the first stop codon downstream of the improper splice junction between exons 6 and 8 in the human SMN2 transcript.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention relates to Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds, compositions comprising an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound and methods to treat or prevent a condition, such as pain, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound.\n\n\n2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nChronic pain is a major contributor to disability and is the cause of much suffering. The successful treatment of severe and chronic pain is a primary goal of the physician, with opioid analgesics being preferred drugs for doing so.\n\n\nUntil recently, there was evidence of three major classes of opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), with each class having subtype receptors. These receptor classes are known as μ, δ and κ. As opiates have a high affinity for these receptors while not being endogenous to the body, research followed in order to identify and isolate the endogenous ligands to these receptors. These ligands were identified as enkephalins, endorphins and dynorphins.\n\n\nRecent experimentation has led to the identification of a cDNA encoding an opioid receptor-like (ORL-1) receptor with a high degree of homology to the known receptor classes. The ORL-1 receptor was classified as an opioid receptor based only on structural grounds, as the receptor did not exhibit pharmacological homology. It was initially demonstrated that non-selective ligands having a high affinity for μ, δ and κ, receptors had low affinity for the ORL-1 receptor. This characteristic, along with the fact that an endogenous ligand had not yet been discovered, led to the term “orphan receptor”.\n\n\nSubsequent research led to the isolation and structure of the endogenous ligand of the ORL-1 receptor (i.e., nociceptin). This ligand is a seventeen amino acid peptide structurally similar to members of the opioid peptide family.\n\n\nThe discovery of the ORL-1 receptor presents an opportunity in drug discovery for novel compounds that can be administered for pain management or other syndromes modulated by this receptor.\n\n\nThe publications “From Hit to Lead: Combining Two Complementary Methods” and “From Hit to Lead: Analyzing Structure-Profile Relationships” of Poulain et al.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIt is an object of the invention to provide new compounds that exhibit affinity for the ORL-1 receptor.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments of the invention, such new compounds exhibit agonist activity at the ORL-1 receptor.\n\n\nIn certain other embodiments of the invention, such new compounds exhibit antagonist activity at the ORL-1 receptor.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments of the invention, such new compounds exhibit affinity for the ORL-1 receptor, and also for one or more of the μ, δ or κ receptors. In a particular embodiment, a new compound of the invention exhibits affinity for both the ORL-1 receptor and the μ receptor. In a more specific embodiment, a new compound of the invention acts as an ORL-1 receptor antagonist and as a μ receptor agonist.\n\n\nCertain new compounds of the invention can be used to treat an animal suffering from chronic or acute pain.\n\n\nIt is a further object of the invention to provide methods of treating chronic or acute pain in an animal by administering one or more Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds of the invention to an animal in need of such treatment. In certain embodiments, such new Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds effectively treat chronic or acute pain in the animal, while producing fewer or reduced side effects compared to previously available compounds.\n\n\nThe invention encompasses compounds of formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nand pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof wherein:\n\n\n\neach R\n2 \nis independently selected from:\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) -halo, —CN, —NO\n2\n, —OT\n3\n, —C(O)T\n3\n, —C(O)OT\n3\n, —C(O)N(T\n1\n)(T\n2\n), —S(O)\n3\nH, —S(O)T\n3\n, —S(O)\n2\nT\n3\n, —S(O)\n2\nN(T\n1\n)(T\n2\n), —N(T\n1\n)(T\n2\n), —N(T\n3\n)C(O)T\n3\n, —N(T\n3\n)C(O)N(T\n1\n)(T\n2\n), —N(T\n3\n)S(O)\n2\nT\n3\n, or —N(T\n3\n)S(O)\n2\nN(T\n1\n)(T\n2\n);

In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable derivative is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, radiolabeled, stereoisomer, enantiomer, diastereomer, other stereoisomeric form, racemic mixture, geometric isomer, and/or tautomer, e.g., of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of the invention. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable derivative is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, e.g., of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of the invention.\n\n\nThe phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable salt,” as used herein, is any pharmaceutically acceptable salt that can be prepared from a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound including a salt formed from an acid and a basic functional group, such as a nitrogen group, of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound. Illustrative salts include, but are not limited, to sulfate, citrate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate, salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucoronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., 1,1′-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” also includes a salt prepared from a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound having an acidic functional group, such as a carboxylic acid functional group, and a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic base. Suitable bases include, but are not limited to, hydroxides of alkali metals such as sodium, potassium, cesium, and lithium; hydroxides of alkaline earth metal such as calcium and magnesium; hydroxides of other metals, such as aluminum and zinc; ammonia and organic amines, such as unsubstituted or hydroxy-substituted mono-, di-, or trialkylamines; dicyclohexylamine; tributyl amine; pyridine; picoline; N-methyl,N-ethylamine; diethylamine; triethylamine; mono-, bis-, or tris-(2-hydroxy-(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkyl amines), such as mono-, bis-, or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, 2-hydroxy-tert-butylamine, or tris-(hydroxymethyl)methylamine, N,N-di-[(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkyl]-N-(hydroxy-(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkyl)-amines, such as N,N-dimethyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, or tri-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine; N-methyl-D-glucamine; and amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and the like. One skilled in the art will recognize that, e.g., acid addition salts of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be prepared by reaction of the compounds with the appropriate acid via a variety of known methods.\n\n\nThe invention disclosed herein is also meant to encompass all solvates of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds. “Solvates” are known in the art and are considered to be a combination, physical association and/or solvation of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound with a solvent molecule, e.g., a disolvate, monosolvate or hemisolvate when the solvent molecule:Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound molecule ratio is 2:1, 1:1 or 1:2, respectively. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances, the solvate can be isolated, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated into the crystal lattice of a crystalline solid. Thus, “solvate,” as used herein, encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of the invention can be present as a solvated form with a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as water, methanol, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention include both solvated and unsolvated Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound forms. As “hydrate” relates to a particular subgroup of solvates, i.e., where the solvent molecule is water, hydrates are included within the solvates of the invention. Preparation of solvates is known in the art. For example, M. Caira et al., \nJ. Pharmaceut. Sci., \n93(3):601-611 (2004), describes the preparation of solvates of fluconazole with ethyl acetate and with water. Similar preparations of solvates, hemisolvate, hydrates, and the like are described by E. C. van Tonder et al., \nAAPS Pharm. Sci. Tech., \n5(1):Article 12 (2004), and A. L. Bingham et al., \nChem. Commun., \n603-604 (2001). A typical, non-limiting, process involves dissolving the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound in a desired amount of the desired solvent (organic, water or mixtures thereof) at temperatures above about 20° C. to about 25° C., cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals, and isolating the crystals by known methods, e.g., filtration. Analytical techniques, for example, infrared spectroscopy, can be used to show the presence of the solvent in a crystal of the solvate.\n\n\nThe invention disclosed herein is also meant to encompass all prodrugs of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds. “Prodrugs” are known in the art and, while not necessarily possessing any pharmaceutical activity as such, are considered to be any covalently bonded carrier(s) that releases the active parent drug in vivo. In general, such prodrugs will be a functional derivative of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of Formulas (I), (II), (III) and/or (IV) which is readily convertible in vivo, e.g., by being metabolized, into the required Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of Formulas (I), (II), (III) and/or (IV). Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described in, for example, \nDesign of Prodrugs\n, H. Bundgaard ed., Elsevier (1985); “Drug and Enzyme Targeting, Part A,” K. Widder et al. eds., Vol. 112 in \nMethods in Enzymology\n, Academic Press (1985); Bundgaard, “Design and Application of Prodrugs,” Chapter 5 (pp. 113-191) in \nA Textbook of Drug Design and Development\n, P. Krogsgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard eds., Harwood Academic Publishers (1991); Bundgaard et al., \nAdv. Drug Delivery Revs. \n8:1-38 (1992); Bundgaard et al., \nJ. Pharmaceut. Sci. \n77:285 (1988); and Kakeya et al., \nChem. Pharm. Bull. \n32:692 (1984).\n\n\nIn addition, one or more hydrogen, carbon or other atoms of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be replaced by an isotope of the hydrogen, carbon or other atoms. Such a “radiolabeled,” “radiolabeled form”, and the like of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound, each of which is encompassed by the invention, is useful as a research and/or diagnostic tool in metabolism pharmacokinetic studies and in binding assays. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, and \n36\nCl, respectively. Radiolabeled compounds of the invention can be prepared by methods known in the art. For example, tritiated compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared by introducing tritium into the particular compound of Formula (I), for example, by catalytic dehalogenation with tritium. This method can include reacting a suitably halogen-substituted precursor of a compound of Formula (I) with tritium gas in the presence of a suitable catalyst, for example, Pd/C, in the presence or absence of a base. Other suitable methods for preparing tritiated compounds can be found in Filer, \nIsotopes in the Physical and Biomedical Sciences, Vol. \n1\n, Labeled Compounds \n(\nPart A\n), Chapter 6 (1987). \n14\nC-labeled compounds can be prepared by employing starting materials having a \n14\nC carbon.\n\n\nA Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms. The invention is also meant to encompass all such possible forms as well as their racemic and resolved forms or any mixture thereof. When a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound contains an olefinic double bond or other center of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended to include all “geometric isomers,” e.g., both E and Z geometric isomers. All “tautomers,” e.g., ketone-enol, amide-imidic acid, lactam-lactim, enamine-imine, amine-imine, and enamine-enimine tautomers, are intended to be encompassed by the invention as well.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms “stereoisomer,” “stereoisomeric form”, and the like are general terms for all isomers of individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space.

Compound F1 can be further alkylated with an R\n12 \ngroup having a leaving group substituent, such as an alkyl bromide, using a suitable base to provide compound F2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound G1 can be hydrogenolyzed using a catalyst, such as palladium on charcoal, in a suitable solvent, such as methanol, under a hydrogen atmosphere to provide compound G2. The —Z—R\n1 \ngroup can be attached to compound G2 as described in Scheme A, e.g., using either alkylation or reductive amination conditions, to provide compound A5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Compound of Formula H1 where each Y is S can be made by, e.g., reacting a Compound of Formula A5 (i.e., where each Y is O) with Lawesson's reagent (i.e., 2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-dithia-2,4-diphosphetane-2,4-disulfide) according to the procedure described in “Lit 3,” which refers the publication Perregaard et al., \nBull. Soc. Chim. Belg. \n86:679-691 (1977). In one embodiment, the Compound of Formula H1 can be made by reacting a Compound of Formula A5 with Lawesson's reagent in a nonpolar solvent such as THF or toluene at a temperature of about 100° C. for about 2-3 hours, as shown above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound C1 can be converted to compound A4 using a catalyst, such as Raney nickel, in a suitable solvent, such as ethanol, under a hydrogen atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound A5 can be reacted with epichlorohydrin in the presence of a suitable base to provide compound J1. Compound J1 can be reacted with a suitable amine, such as NH(R)\n2\n, in a suitable solvent to provide compound J2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe piperidine nitrogen of compound A2 can be protected as, e.g., the trifluoroacetamide or carbobenzyloxy carbamate using trifluoroacetic anhydride or benzychloroformate, respectively, in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane in the presence of an organic base such as triethylamine to provide compound K1. Compound K1 can be reductively aminated with a substituted or unsubstituted 1,2-phenylenediamine using sodium triacetoxyborohydride in a solvent such as dichloromethane in the presence of acetic acid to provide compound K2. Compound K2 can be cyclized with a cyclizing reagent, such as a di-acid chloride, e.g., oxalyl dichloride or malonyl dichloride, to provide compound K3. The protecting group (such as —C(O)R illustrated above) can be removed under standard conditions (see, e.g., “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis,” T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 3\nrd \nEd., New York (1999), pp. 531-535, 556-557) to provide compound K4. The —Z—R\n1 \ngroup can be attached to compound K1 as described in Scheme A, e.g., using either alkylation or reductive amination conditions, to provide compound A5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound L1 can be converted to compound L2 in a three step procedure as follows. Substituted pyridine compound L1 can be treated with di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate and 4-dimethylamino pyridine in a suitable solvent to provide a di-BOC protected intermediate. The intermediate can be treated with potassium carbonate to provide the mono-BOC protected intermediate which can be converted to compound L2 by hydrogenating using Raney nickel or other standard conditions (using palladium on carbon or the like). Compound L2 can be reductively aminated with a suitably functionalized 4-piperidone (containing a Z—R\n1\n, group on the piperidine nitrogen and substituents A and B) using sodium triacetoxyborohydride and an acid such as acetic acid in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane to provide compound L3. The BOC protecting group can be removed under acid conditions (for example, using hydrogen chloride in ethyl acetate) to provide compound A4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound A4 can be converted to the 4-methoxybenzoyl derivative compound M1 using 4-methoxy-benzoylchloride in a suitable solvent in the presence of an organic or inorganic base. Compound M1 can be reduced to compound M2, e.g., using lithium aluminum hydride. As described in Scheme D, compound M2 can be converted to compound M3 using ethoxycarbonyl isocyanate in a microwave reactor. Alternatively, compound A4 can be reacted with a cyclizing reagent, such as ethyl 2-chloro-2-oxoacetate or ethyl 3-chloro-3-oxopropanoate, and a base such as triethylamine in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane to provide compound M4. Compound M4 can be converted to compound A5 using an alkali metal alkoxide such as sodium ethoxide in a suitable solvent such as ethanol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound N1 can be converted to compound N2 using lithium diisopropylamide in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran followed by treatment with a D having a leaving group substituent, e.g., iodomethane. Compound N2 can be converted to compound N3 in a two step procedure. First, the ester can be hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid using an aqueous base such as sodium hydroxide. This can be followed by treatment with diphenylphosphoryl azide and benzyl alcohol under Curtius rearrangement conditions. The benzyloxycarbonyl group of compound N3 can be removed under hydrogenolysis conditions, e.g., using palladium on charcoal, to provide compound N4. Compound N4 can be converted to compound N5 by reaction with a substituted or unsubstituted 2-halo-1-nitrobenzene, such substituted or unsubstituted as 2-fluoro-1-nitrobenzene, in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile. Compound N5 can be converted to compound N6 in a two step procedure. First, reduction of the nitro group can be carried out by hydrogenation using a metal catalyst such as Raney nickel in a suitable solvent such as ethanol. This can be followed by reaction with a cyclizing reagent, such as ethyl 2-chloro-2-oxoacetate or ethyl 3-chloro-3-oxopropanoate, and a base such as triethylamine and a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane. Compound N6 can be converted to compound N7 using an alkali metal alkoxide, such as sodium ethoxide, in a suitable solvent, such as ethanol, followed by removal of the protecting group R under standard conditions. The —Z—R\n1\n, group can be attached to compound N7 as described in Scheme A, e.g., using either alkylation or reductive amination conditions, to provide compound N8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound O1 can be reacted with a substituted or unsubstituted 1,2-phenylenediamine and a catalytic amount of an acid such as acetic acid in a suitable solvent such as toluene with azeotropic water removal in a Dean-Stark apparatus to provide compound O2. Compound O2 can be cyclized to compound O3 by reaction with cyclizing reagent, such as a di-acid chloride, e.g., oxalyl dichloride or malonyl dichloride, in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane under high dilution conditions. Compound O3 can be converted to compound O4 under basic conditions in a suitable solvent, e.g., by reaction with aqueous sodium hydroxide in ethanol. Alternatively, compound O3 can be alkylated with an R\n3 \ngroup having a leaving group substituent, such as an alkyl bromide or alkyl chloride, using a suitable base such as sodium hydride in a suitable solvent such as DMF to provide compound O5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound P1 can be converted to compound P2 using the desired amine under Buchwald-Hartwig palladium-catalyzed amination conditions, e.g., by adapting the procedure described in the publication J. Louie and J. F. Hartwig, \nTetrahedron Lett. \n36(21):3609-3612 (1995).\n\n\n4.7 Therapeutic Uses of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds\n\n\nIn accordance with the invention, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are administered to an animal in need of treatment or prevention of a Condition.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be used to treat or prevent any condition treatable or preventable by inhibiting the activity of the ORL-1 receptor. Examples of conditions that are treatable or preventable by inhibiting the activity of the ORL-1 receptor include, but are not limited to, pain (CNS effect), memory disorders, obesity, constipation, depression, dementia, and Parkinsonism.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be used to treat or prevent any condition treatable or preventable by activating the ORL-1 receptor. Examples of conditions that are treatable or preventable by activating the ORL-1 receptor include, but are not limited to, pain (PNS effect), anxiety, cough, diarrhea, blood pressure disorder (via vasodilation and via diuresis), epilepsy, anorexia/cachexia, urinary incontinence, and drug abuse.\n\n\nThe Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds can be used to treat or prevent acute or chronic pain. Examples of pain that can be treated or prevented using a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound include, but are not limited to, cancer pain, neuropathic pain, labor pain, myocardial infarction pain, pancreatic pain, colic pain, post-operative pain, headache pain, muscle pain, arthritic pain, and pain associated with a periodontal disease, including gingivitis and periodontitis.\n\n\nThe Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds can also be used to treat or prevent pain associated with inflammation or with an inflammatory disease in an animal. Such pain can arise where there is an inflammation of the body tissue which can be a local inflammatory response or a systemic inflammation. For example, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be used to treat or prevent pain associated with inflammatory diseases including, but not limited to, organ transplant rejection; reoxygenation injury resulting from organ transplantation (see Grupp et al., \nJ. Mol, Cell Cardiol. \n31:297-303 (1999)) including, but not limited to, transplantation of the heart, lung, liver, or kidney; chronic inflammatory diseases of the joints, including arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and bone diseases associated with increased bone resorption; inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ileitis, ulcerative colitis, Barrett's syndrome, and Crohn's disease; inflammatory lung diseases, such as asthma, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and chronic obstructive airway disease; inflammatory diseases of the eye, including corneal dystrophy, trachoma, onchocerciasis, uveitis, sympathetic ophthalmitis and endophthalmitis; chronic inflammatory disease of the gum, including gingivitis and periodontitis; tuberculosis; leprosy; inflammatory diseases of the kidney, including uremic complications, glomerulonephritis and nephrosis; inflammatory disease of the skin, including sclerodermatitis, psoriasis and eczema; inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, including chronic demyelinating diseases of the nervous system, multiple sclerosis, AIDS-related neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease, infectious meningitis, encephalomyelitis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and viral or autoimmune encephalitis; autoimmune diseases, including Type I and Type II diabetes mellitus; diabetic complications, including, but not limited to, diabetic cataract, glaucoma, retinopathy, nephropathy (such as microaluminuria and progressive diabetic nephropathy), gangrene of the feet, atherosclerotic coronary arterial disease, peripheral arterial disease, nonketotic hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar coma, foot ulcers, joint problems, and a skin or mucous membrane complication (such as an infection, a shin spot, a candidal infection or necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum), immune-complex vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); inflammatory disease of the heart, such as cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease hypercholesterolemia, and atherosclerosis; as well as various other diseases that can have significant inflammatory components, including preeclampsia, chronic liver failure, brain and spinal cord trauma, and cancer. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can also be used to treat or prevent pain associated with inflammatory disease that can, for example, be a systemic inflammation of the body, exemplified by gram-positive or gram negative shock, hemorrhagic or anaphylactic shock, or shock induced by cancer chemotherapy in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., shock associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Such shock can be induced, e.g., by a chemotherapeutic agent that is administered as a treatment for cancer.\n\n\nThe Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds can also be used to treat or prevent pain associated with nerve injury (i.e., neuropathic pain). Chronic neuropathic pain is a heterogenous disease state with an unclear etiology. In chronic neuropathic pain, the pain can be mediated by multiple mechanisms. This type of pain generally arises from injury to the peripheral or central nervous tissue. The syndromes include pain associated with spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, phantom pain, causalgia, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy and lower back pain. The chronic pain is different from acute pain in that chronic neuropathic pain patients suffer the abnormal pain sensations that can be described as spontaneous pain, continuous superficial burning and/or deep aching pain. The pain can be evoked by heat-, cold-, and mechano-hyperalgesia, or by heat-, cold-, or mechano-allodynia.\n\n\nChronic neuropathic pain can be caused by injury or infection of peripheral sensory nerves. It includes, but is not limited to, pain from peripheral nerve trauma, herpes virus infection, diabetes mellitus, causalgia, plexus avulsion, neuroma, limb amputation, and vasculitis. Neuropathic pain can also be caused by nerve damage from chronic alcoholism, human immunodeficiency virus infection, hypothyroidism, uremia, or vitamin deficiencies. Stroke (spinal or brain) and spinal cord injury can also induce neuropathic pain. Cancer-related neuropathic pain results from tumor growth compression of adjacent nerves, brain, or spinal cord. In addition, cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can cause nerve injury. Neuropathic pain includes but is not limited to pain caused by nerve injury such as, for example, the pain from which diabetics suffer.\n\n\nThe Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds can be used to treat or prevent a migraine including, but not limited to, migraine without aura (“common migraine”), migraine with aura (“classic migraine”), migraine without headache, basilar migraine, familial hemiplegic migraine, migrainous infarction, and migraine with prolonged aura.\n\n\nAccording to the invention, some of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are agonists at the ORL-1 receptor, and some of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are antagonists at the ORL-1 receptor. In another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is an agonist at the ORL-1 receptor and an agonist at a μ, κ and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a μ opioid receptor. In another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is an antagonist at the ORL-1 receptor and an agonist at a μ, κ and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a μ opioid receptor. In another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is an agonist at the ORL-1 receptor and an antagonist at a μ, κ and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a μ opioid receptor. In another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is an antagonist at the ORL-1 receptor and an antagonist at a μ, κ and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a μ opioid receptor.\n\n\nThe invention also provides methods for inhibiting ORL-1 receptor function in a cell, comprising contacting a cell capable of expressing the ORL-1 receptor with an amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound effective to inhibit ORL-1 receptor function in the cell. This method can be adapted for use in vitro as part of an assay to select compounds that may be useful for treating or preventing a Condition in an animal. Alternatively, this method can be adapted for use in vivo, (i.e., in an animal such as a human) by contacting a cell in the animal with an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound. In one embodiment, the method is useful for treating or preventing pain in an animal in need of such treatment or prevention. In another embodiment, the method is useful for treating or preventing a memory disorder, obesity, constipation, depression, dementia, or Parkinsonism in an animal in need of such treatment or prevention.\n\n\nThe invention also relates to methods for activating ORL-1 receptor function in a cell, comprising contacting a cell capable of expressing the ORL-1 receptor with an amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound effective to activate ORL-1 receptor function in the cell. This method can be adapted for use in vitro as part of an assay to select compounds useful for treating or preventing, pain, anxiety, cough, diarrhea, high blood pressure, epilepsy, anorexia/cachexia, urinary incontinence, or drug abuse. Alternatively, the method can be adapted for use in vivo (i.e., in an animal such as a human), by contacting a cell in the animal with an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine compound. In one embodiment the method is useful for treating or preventing pain in an animal in need of such treatment or prevention. In another embodiment, the method is useful for treating or preventing anxiety, cough, diarrhea, high blood pressure, epilepsy, anorexia/cachexia, urinary incontinence, or drug abuse in an animal in need of such treatment or prevention.\n\n\nExamples of tissue comprising cells capable of expressing the ORL-1 receptor include but are not limited to brain, spinal cord, vas deferens, and gastrointestinal tract tissue. Methods for assaying cells that express the ORL-1 receptor are known in the art; for example, see Y. Shimohigashi et al., “Sensitivity of opioid receptor-like receptor ORL1 for chemical modification on nociceptin, a naturally occurring nociceptive peptide,” \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n271(39):23642-23645 (1996); M. Narita et al., “Identification of the G-protein coupled ORL1 receptor in the mouse spinal cord by [\n35\nS]-GTPγS binding and immunohistochemistry,” \nBrit. J. Pharmacol. \n128:1300-1306 (1999); G. Milligan, “Principles: Extending then utility of [\n35\nS]GTPγS binding assays,” \nTIPS \n14: 87-90 (2003); and S. Lazareno, “Measurement of agonist-stimulated [\n35\nS]GTPγS binding to cell membranes,” \nMethods in Molecular Biology \n106:231-245 (1999).\n\n\n4.8 Therapeutic/Prophylactic Administration and Compositions of the Invention\n\n\nDue to their activity, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are advantageously useful in human and veterinary medicine. As described above, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are useful for treating or preventing a Condition in an animal in need thereof. The Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds of the invention can be administered to any animal requiring modulation of the opioid and/or ORL-1 receptors.\n\n\nWhen administered to an animal, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be administered as a component of a composition that comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The invention compositions, which comprise a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound, can be administered orally. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can also be administered by any other convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral, rectal, and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and can be administered together with a second therapeutically active agent. Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, multiparticulates, capsules, etc., and can be used to administer a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound.\n\n\nMethods of administration include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, parenteral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectal, by inhalation, or topical, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. The method of administration is left to the discretion of the practitioner. In most instances, administration will result in the release of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound into the bloodstream.\n\n\nIn specific embodiments, it can be desirable to administer a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound locally. This can be achieved, for example and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository or enema, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as silastic membranes, or fibers.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, it can be desirable to introduce a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound into the central nervous system or gastrointestinal tract by any suitable route, including intraventricular, intrathecal, and epidural injection, and enema. Intraventricular injection can be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir.\n\n\nPulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent, or via perfusion in a fluorocarbon or synthetic pulmonary surfactant. In certain embodiments, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and excipients such as triglycerides.\n\n\nWhen a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of the invention is incorporated for parenteral administration by injection (e.g., continuous infusion or bolus injection), the formulation for parenteral administration can be in the form of a suspension, solution, emulsion in an oily or aqueous vehicle, and such formulations can further comprise pharmaceutically necessary additives such as one or more stabilizing agents, suspending agents, dispersing agents, and the like. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of the invention can also be in the form of a powder for reconstitution as an injectable formulation.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, \nScience \n249:1527-1533 (1990); and Treat et al., \nLiposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer \n317-327 and 353-365 (1989)).\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be delivered in a controlled-release system or sustained-release system (see, e.g., Goodson, “Dental Applications” (pp. 115-138) in \nMedical Applications of Controlled Release, Vol. \n2\n, Applications and Evaluation\n, R. S. Langer and D. L. Wise eds., CRC Press (1984)). Other controlled- or sustained-release systems discussed in the review by Langer, \nScience \n249:1527-1533 (1990) can be used. In one embodiment, a pump can be used (Langer, \nScience \n249:1527-1533 (1990); Sefton, \nCRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. \n14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980); and Saudek et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n321:574 (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see \nMedical Applications of Controlled Release \n(Langer and Wise eds., 1974); \nControlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance \n(Smolen and Ball eds., 1984); Langer and Peppas, \nJ. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. \n23:61 (1983); Levy et al., \nScience \n228:190 (1985); During et al., \nAnn. Neurol. \n25:351 (1989); and Howard et al., \nJ. Neurosurg. \n71:105 (1989)). In yet another embodiment, a controlled- or sustained-release system can be placed in proximity of a target of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound, e.g., the spinal column, brain, or gastrointestinal tract, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose.\n\n\nThe invention compositions can optionally comprise a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient so as to provide the form for proper administration to the animal. Such a pharmaceutical excipient can be a diluent, suspending agent, solubilizer, binder, disintegrant, preservative, coloring agent, lubricant, and the like. The pharmaceutical excipient can be a liquid, such as water or an oil, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. The pharmaceutical excipient can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating, and coloring agents can be used. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is sterile when administered to an animal. Water is a particularly useful excipient when a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid excipients, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients also include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The invention compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. Specific examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients that can be used to formulate oral dosage forms are described in the \nHandbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients\n, American Pharmaceutical Association (1986).\n\n\nThe invention compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the composition is in the form of a capsule (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,155). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical excipients are described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., 19th ed. 1995), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a composition adapted for oral administration to human beings. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound to be orally delivered can be in the form of tablets, capsules, gelcaps, caplets, lozenges, aqueous or oily solutions, suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, for example. When a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is incorporated into oral tablets, such tablets can be compressed, tablet triturates, enteric-coated, sugar-coated, film-coated, multiply compressed or multiply layered. Techniques and compositions for making solid oral dosage forms are described in \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets \n(Lieberman, Lachman and Schwartz, eds., 2nd ed.) published by Marcel Dekker, Inc. Techniques and compositions for making tablets (compressed and molded), capsules (hard and soft gelatin) and pills are also described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n1553-1593 (Arthur Osol, ed., 16\nth \ned., Mack Publishing, Easton, Pa. 1980).\n\n\nLiquid oral dosage forms include aqueous and nonaqueous solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and solutions and/or suspensions reconstituted from non-effervescent granules, optionally containing one or more suitable solvents, preservatives, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, diluents, sweeteners, coloring agents, flavoring agents, and the like. Techniques and composition for making liquid oral dosage forms are described in \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms. Disperse Systems\n, (Lieberman, Rieger and Banker, eds.) published by Marcel Dekker, Inc.\n\n\nWhen a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is to be injected parenterally, it can be, e.g., in the form of an isotonic sterile solution. Alternatively, when a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is to be inhaled, it can be formulated into a dry aerosol or can be formulated into an aqueous or partially aqueous solution.\n\n\nAn orally administered Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can contain one or more agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compositions. In these latter platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time-delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate can also be used. Oral compositions can include standard excipients such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose, and magnesium carbonate. In one embodiment, the excipients are of pharmaceutical grade.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds can be formulated for intravenous administration. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration comprise sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions can also include a solubilizing agent. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound for intravenous administration can optionally include a local anesthetic such as benzocaine or prilocaine to lessen pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is administered by injection, an ampule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.\n\n\nA Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be administered by controlled-release or sustained-release means or by delivery devices that are known to those in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 4,008,719; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; and 5,733,566, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide controlled- or sustained-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, multiparticulates, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled- or sustained-release formulations known to those in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active ingredients of the invention. The invention thus encompasses single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled- or sustained-release.\n\n\nControlled- or sustained-release pharmaceutical compositions can have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled or non-sustained-release counterparts. In one embodiment, a controlled- or sustained-release composition comprises a minimal amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound to treat or prevent the Condition or a symptom thereof in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled- or sustained-release compositions include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased compliance. In addition, controlled- or sustained-release compositions can favorably affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound, and can thus reduce the occurrence of adverse side effects.\n\n\nControlled- or sustained-release compositions can initially release an amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound that promptly produces the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect, and gradually and continually release other amounts of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. To maintain a constant level of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound in the body, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled- or sustained-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions, including but not limited to, changes in pH, changes in temperature, concentration or availability of enzymes, concentration or availability of water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.\n\n\nThe amount of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound that is effective for the treatment or prevention of a condition can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro and/or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed will also depend on, e.g., the route of administration and the seriousness of the Condition, and can be decided according to the judgment of a practitioner and/or each animal's circumstances. In other examples thereof, variations will necessarily occur depending upon the weight and physical condition (e.g., hepatic and renal function) of the animal being treated, the affliction to be treated, the severity of the symptoms, the frequency of the dosage interval, the presence of any deleterious side-effects, and the particular compound utilized, among other things.\n\n\nSuitable effective dosage amounts, however, range from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 3000 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day, although they are typically from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 2500 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day or from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 1000 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day. In one embodiment, the effective dosage amount is about 100 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day or less. In another embodiment, the effective dosage amount ranges from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 100 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound, in another embodiment, about 0.02 mg/kg of body weight to about 50 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day, and in another embodiment, about 0.025 mg/kg of body weight to about 20 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day.\n\n\nAdministration can be as a single dose or as a divided dose. In one embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 24 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 12 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 8 h until the Condition is abated.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 6 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 4 h until the Condition is abated. The effective dosage amounts described herein refer to total amounts administered; that is, if more than one Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is administered, the effective dosage amounts correspond to the total amount administered.\n\n\nWhere a cell capable of expressing the ORL-1 receptor is contacted with a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound in vitro, the amount effective for inhibiting or activating the ORL-1 receptor function in a cell will typically range from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−4 \nmol/L, in one embodiment, from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−5 \nmol/L, in another embodiment, from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−6 \nmol/L, and in another embodiment, from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−9 \nmol/L of a solution or suspension of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.

The rats are group-housed and have free access to food and water at all times, except prior to oral administration of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound when food is removed for 16 hours before dosing. A control group acts as a comparison to rats treated with a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound. The control group is administered the carrier for the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound. The volume of carrier administered to the control group is the same as the volume of carrier and Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound administered to the test group.\n\n\nAcute Pain: To assess the actions of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound for the treatment or prevention of acute pain, the rat tail flick test can be used. Rats are gently restrained by hand and the tail exposed to a focused beam of radiant heat at a point 5 cm from the tip using a tail flick unit (Model 7360, commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy). Tail flick latencies are defined as the interval between the onset of the thermal stimulus and the flick of the tail. Animals not responding within 20 seconds are removed from the tail flick unit and assigned a withdrawal latency of 20 seconds. Tail flick latencies are measured immediately before (pretreatment) and 1, 3, and 5 hours following administration of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound. Data are expressed as tail flick latency(s) and the percentage of the maximal possible effect (% MPE), i.e., 20 seconds, is calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nMPE\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\npost\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nadministration\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nlatency\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\npre\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nadministration\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nlatency\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ns\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\npre\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nadministration\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nlatency\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rat tail flick test is described in F. E. D'Amour et al., “A Method for Determining Loss of Pain Sensation,” \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n72:74-79 (1941).\n\n\nAcute pain can also be assessed by measuring the animal's response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining the paw withdrawal threshold (“PWT”), as described below.\n\n\nInflammatory Pain: To assess the actions of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound for the treatment or prevention of inflammatory pain, the Freund's complete adjuvant (“FCA”) model of inflammatory pain is used. FCA-induced inflammation of the rat hind paw is associated with the development of persistent inflammatory mechanical hyperalgesia and provides reliable prediction of the anti-hyperalgesic action of clinically useful analgesic drugs (L. Bartho et al., “Involvement of Capsaicin-sensitive Neurones in Hyperalgesia and Enhanced Opioid Antinociception in Inflammation,” \nNaunyn\n-\nSchmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacol. \n342:666-670 (1990)). The left hind paw of each animal is administered a 50 μL intraplantar injection of 50% FCA. 24 hour post injection, the animal is assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining the PWT, as described below. Rats are then administered a single injection of 1, 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of either a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound; 30 mg/kg of a control selected from Celebrex, indomethacin or naproxen; or carrier. Responses to noxious mechanical stimuli are then determined 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours post administration. Percentage reversal of hyperalgesia for each animal is defined as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nReversal\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\npost\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nadministration\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nPWT\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\npre\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nadministration\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nPWT\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nbaseline\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nPWT\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\npre\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nadministration\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nPWT\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeuropathic Pain To assess the actions of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound for the treatment or prevention of neuropathic pain, either the Seltzer model or the Chung model can be used.\n\n\nIn the Seltzer model, the partial sciatic nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain is used to produce neuropathic hyperalgesia in rats (Z. Seltzer et al., “A Novel Behavioral Model of Neuropathic Pain Disorders Produced in Rats by Partial Sciatic Nerve Injury,” \nPain \n43:205-218 (1990)). Partial ligation of the left sciatic nerve is performed under isoflurane/O\n2 \ninhalation anesthesia. Following induction of anesthesia, the left thigh of the rat is shaved and the sciatic nerve exposed at high thigh level through a small incision and is carefully cleared of surrounding connective tissues at a site near the trocanther just distal to the point at which the posterior biceps semitendinosus nerve branches off of the common sciatic nerve. A 7-0 silk suture is inserted into the nerve with a ⅜ curved, reversed-cutting mini-needle and tightly ligated so that the dorsal ⅓ to ½ of the nerve thickness is held within the ligature. The wound is closed with a single muscle suture (4-0 nylon (Vicryl)) and vetbond tissue glue. Following surgery, the wound area is dusted with antibiotic powder. Sham-treated rats undergo an identical surgical procedure except that the sciatic nerve is not manipulated. Following surgery, animals are weighed and placed on a warm pad until they recover from anesthesia. Animals are then returned to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animal is assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT, as described below, prior to surgery (baseline), then immediately prior to and 1, 3, and 5 hours after drug administration for rear paw of the animal.

Surgery is performed under isoflurane/O\n2 \ninhalation anesthesia. Following induction of anesthesia, a 3 cm incision is made and the left paraspinal muscles are separated from the spinous process at the L\n4\n-S\n2 \nlevels. The L\n6 \ntransverse process is carefully removed with a pair of small rongeurs to identify visually the L\n4\n-L\n6 \nspinal nerves. The left L\n5 \n(or L\n5 \nand L\n6\n) spinal nerve(s) is isolated and tightly ligated with silk thread. A complete hemostasis is confirmed and the wound is sutured using non-absorbable sutures, such as nylon sutures or stainless steel staples. Sham-treated rats undergo an identical surgical procedure except that the spinal nerve(s) is not manipulated. Following surgery animals are weighed, administered a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of saline or ringers lactate, the wound area is dusted with antibiotic powder and they are kept on a warm pad until they recover from the anesthesia. Animals are then returned to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animals are assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT, as described below, prior to surgery (baseline), then immediately prior to and 1, 3, and 5 hours after being administered a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound for the left rear paw of the animal. The animal can also be assessed for response to noxious thermal stimuli or for tactile allodynia, as described below. The Chung model for neuropathic pain is described in S. H. Kim, “An Experimental Model for Peripheral Neuropathy Produced by Segmental Spinal Nerve Ligation in the Rat,” \nPain \n50(3):355-363 (1992).\n\n\nResponse to Mechanical Stimuli as an Assessment of Mechanical Hyperalesia: The paw pressure assay can be used to assess mechanical hyperalgesia. For this assay, hind paw withdrawal thresholds (PWT) to a noxious mechanical stimulus are determined using an analgesymeter (Model 7200, commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy) as described in C. Stein, “Unilateral Inflammation of the Hindpaw in Rats as a Model of Prolonged Noxious Stimulation: Alterations in Behavior and Nociceptive Thresholds,” \nPharmacol. Biochem. and Behavior \n31:451-455 (1988). The maximum weight that can be applied to the hind paw is set at 250 g and the end point is taken as complete withdrawal of the paw. PWT is determined once for each rat at each time point and either only the affected (ipsilateral) paw is tested, or both the ipsilateral and contralateral (non-injured) paw are tested.\n\n\nResponse to Thermal Stimuli as an Assessment of Thermal Hyperaleesia: The plantar test can be used to assess thermal hyperalgesia. For this test, hind paw withdrawal latencies to a noxious thermal stimulus are determined using a plantar test apparatus (commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy) following the technique described by K. Hargreaves et al., “A New and Sensitive Method for Measuring Thermal Nociception in Cutaneous Hyperalgesia,” \nPain \n32(1):77-88 (1988). The maximum exposure time is set at 32 seconds to avoid tissue damage and any directed paw withdrawal from the heat source is taken as the end point. Three latencies are determined at each time point and averaged. Either only the affected (ipsilateral) paw is tested, or both the ipsilateral and contralateral (non-injured) paw are tested.\n\n\nAssessment of Tactile Allodynia: To assess tactile allodynia, rats are placed in clear, plexiglass compartments with a wire mesh floor and allowed to habituate for a period of at least 15 minutes. After habituation, a series of von Frey monofilaments are presented to the plantar surface of the left (operated) foot of each rat. The series of von Frey monofilaments consists of six monofilaments of increasing diameter, with the smallest diameter fiber presented first. Five trials are conducted with each filament with each trial separated by approximately 2 minutes. Each presentation lasts for a period of 4-8 seconds or until a nociceptive withdrawal behavior is observed. Flinching, paw withdrawal or licking of the paw are considered nociceptive behavioral responses.\n\n\nThe invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments disclosed in the examples that are intended as illustrations of a few aspects of the invention and any embodiments that are functionally equivalent are within the scope of this invention.
