Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application is a division of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/009,768 filed Dec. 10, 2004 which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/539,509 filed Jan. 27, 2004 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/570,336 filed May 12, 2004. This application further claims priority from GB Application No. 0329693.6 filed Dec. 22, 2003 and GB Application No. 0408789.6 filed Apr. 20, 2004.\n\n\nThis invention relates to triazole derivatives and to processes for the preparation of, intermediates used in the preparation of, compositions containing and the uses of, such derivatives.\n\n\nThe triazole derivatives of the present invention are vasopressin antagonists. In particular they are antagonists of the V1a receptor and have a number of therapeutic applications, particularly in the treatment of dysmenorrhoea (primary and secondary).\n\n\nThere is a high unmet need in the area of menstrual disorders and it is estimated that up to 90% of all menstruating women are affected to some degree. Up to 42% of women miss work or other activities due to menstrual pain and it has been estimated that around 600 million work hours a year are lost in the US as a result {Coco, A. S. (1999). Primary dysmenorrhoea. [Review] [30 refs]. \nAmerican Family Physician, \n60, 489-96.}.\n\n\nMenstrual pain in the lower abdomen is caused by myometrial hyperactivity and reduced uterine blood flow. These pathophysiological changes result in abdominal pain that radiates out to the back and legs. This may result in women feeling nauseous, having headaches and suffering from insomnia. This condition is called dysmenorrhoea and can be classified as either primary or secondary dysmenorrhoea.\n\n\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea is diagnosed when no abnormality causing the condition is identified. This affects up to 50% of the female population {Coco, A. S. (1999). Primary dysmenorrhoea. [Review] [30 refs]. \nAmerican Family Physician, \n60, 489-96.; Schroeder, B. & Sanfilippo, J. S. (1999). Dysmenorrhoea and pelvic pain in adolescents. [Review][78 refs]. \nPediatric Clinics of North America, \n46, 555-71}. Where an underlying gynaecological disorder is present, such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), fibroids or cancers, secondary dysmenorrhoea will be diagnosed. Secondary dysmenorrhoea is diagnosed in only approximately 25% of women suffering from dysmenorrhoea. Dysmenorrhoea can occur in conjunction with menorrhagia, which accounts for around 12% of referrals to gynaecology outpatients departments.\n\n\nCurrently, women suffering from primary dysmenorrhoea are treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID's) or the oral contraceptive pill. In cases of secondary dysmenorrhoea surgery may be undertaken to correct the underlying gynaecological disorder.\n\n\nWomen suffering from dysmenorrhoea have circulating vasopressin levels which are greater than those observed in healthy women at the same time of the menstrual cycle. Inhibition of the pharmacological actions of vasopressin, at the uterine vasopressin receptor, may prevent dysmenorrhoea.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are therefore potentially useful in the treatment of a wide range of disorders, particularly aggression, Alzheimer's disease, anorexia nervosa, anxiety, anxiety disorder, asthma, atherosclerosis, autism, cardiovascular disease (including angina, atherosclerosis, hypertension, heart failure, edema, hypernatremia), cataract, central nervous system disease, cerebrovascular ischemia, cirrhosis, cognitive disorder, Cushing's disease, depression, diabetes mellitus, dysmenorrhoea (primary and secondary), emesis (including motion sickness), endometriosis, gastrointestinal disease, glaucoma, gynaecological disease, heart disease, intrauterine growth retardation, inflammation (including rheumatoid arthritis), ischemia, ischemic heart disease, lung tumor, micturition disorder, mittlesmerchz, neoplasm, nephrotoxicity, non-insulin dependent diabetes, obesity, obsessive/compulsive disorder, ocular hypertension, preclampsia, premature ejaculation, premature (preterm) labour, pulmonary disease, Raynaud's disease, renal disease, renal failure, male or female sexual dysfunction, septic shock, sleep disorder, spinal cord injury, thrombosis, urogenital tract infection or urolithiasis.\n\n\nParticularly of interest are the following diseases or disorders:\n\n \n \nanxiety, cardiovascular disease (including angina, atherosclerosis, hypertension, heart failure, edema, hypernatremia), dysmenorrhoea (primary and secondary), endometriosis, emesis (including motion sickness), intrauterine growth retardation, inflammation (including rheumatoid arthritis), mittlesmerchz, preclampsia, premature ejaculation, premature (preterm) labour and Raynaud's disease.\n \n\n\nThe compounds of the invention, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates, have the advantage that they are selective inhibitors of the V1a receptor (and so are likely to have reduced side effects), they may have a more rapid onset of action, they may be more potent, they may be longer acting, they may have greater bioavailability or they my have other more desirable properties than the compounds of the prior art.\n\n\nAccording to the present invention there is provided a compound of formula (I),\n\n\n \n \n \n

The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionisation in the salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non-ionised.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may exist in both unsolvated and solvated forms. The term “solvate” is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term “hydrate” is employed when said solvent is water.\n\n\nIncluded within the scope of the invention are complexes such as clathrates, drug-host inclusion complexes wherein, in contrast to the aforementioned solvates, the drug and host are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts.

Thus certain derivatives of compounds of formula (I) which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into compounds of formula (I) having the desired activity, for example, hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as “prodrugs”. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in “Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T Higuchi and W Stella) and “Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design”, Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed. E B Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association).\n\n\nProdrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of formula (I) with certain moieties know to those skilled in the art as “pro-moieties” as described, for example, in “Design of Prodrugs” by H Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985).\n\n\nSome examples of prodrugs in accordance with the invention include:\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) where the compound of formula (I) contains a carboxylic acid functionality (—COOH), an ester thereof, for example, replacement of the hydrogen with C\n1-8 \nalkyl;\n \n(ii) where the compound of formula (I) contains an alcohol functionality (—OH), an ether thereof, for example, replacement of the hydrogen with C\n1-6 \nalkanoyloxymethyl; and\n \n(iii) where the compound of formula (I) contains a primary or secondary amino functionality (—NH\n2 \nor —NHR where R≠H), an amide thereof, for example, replacement of one or both hydrogens with C\n1-10 \nalkanoyl.\n \n \n \n\n\nFurther examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references.\n\n\nFinally, certain compounds of formula (I) may themselves act as prodrugs of other compounds of formula (I).\n\n\nAlso within the scope of the invention are the metabolites of the compounds of formula (I) when formed in vivo.\n\n\nCompounds of formula (I) containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Where a compound of formula (I) contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric cis/trans (or Z/E) isomers are possible, and where the compound contains, for example, a keto or oxime group or an aromatic moiety, tautomeric isomerism (‘tautomerism’) may occur. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.\n\n\nIncluded within the scope of the present invention are all stereoisomers, geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I), including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism, and mixtures of one or more thereof. Also included are acid addition or base salts wherein the counter ion is optically active, for example, D-lactate or L-lysine, or racemic, for example, DL-tartrate or DL-arginine.\n\n\nCis/trans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example, fractional crystallisation and chromatography.\n\n\nConventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral HPLC.\n\n\nAlternatively, the racemate (or racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compounds of formula (I) contains an acidic or basic moiety, an acid or base such as tartaric acid or 1-phenylethylamine. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallisation and one or both of the diastereomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person.\n\n\nChiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% isopropanol, typically from 2 to 20%, and from 0 to 5% of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.\n\n\nStereoisomeric conglomerates may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art—see, for example, “Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds” by E L Eliel (Wiley, New York, 1994).\n\n\nThe present invention also includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopic variations of a compound of the formula (I) one or more atoms is replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature.\n\n\nExamples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen such as \n2\nH and \n3\nH, carbon such as \n11\nC, \n13\nC and \n14\nC, nitrogen such as \n13\nN and \n15\nN, oxygen such as \n15\nO, \n17\nO and \n18\nO, phosphorus such as \n32\nP, sulphur such as \n35\nS, fluorine such as \n18\nF, iodine such as \n123\nI and \n125\nI, and chlorine such as \n36\nCl.\n\n\nCertain isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I), for example those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. \n3\nH, and carbon-14, i.e. \n14\nC, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.\n\n\nSubstitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. \n2\nH, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.\n\n\nSubstitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as \n11\nC, \n18\nF, \n15\nO and \n13\nN, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.\n\n\nIsotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using appropriate isotopically-labelled reagents in place of the non-labelled reagent previously employed.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallisation may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D\n2\nO, d\n6\n-acetone and d\n6\n-DMSO.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention are useful in therapy. Therefore, a further aspect of the invention is the use of a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically salt or solvate thereof, as a medicament.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention show activity as V1a antagonists. In particular they are useful in the treatment of a number of conditions including aggression, Alzheimer's disease, anorexia nervosa, anxiety, anxiety disorder, asthma, atherosclerosis, autism, cardiovascular disease (including angina, atherosclerosis, hypertension, heart failure, edema, hypernatremia), cataract, central nervous system disease, cerebrovascular ischemia, cirrhosis, cognitive disorder, Cushing's disease, depression, diabetes mellitus, dysmenorrhoea (primary and secondary), emesis (including motion sickness), endometriosis, gastrointestinal disease, glaucoma, gynaecological disease, heart disease, intrauterine growth retardation, inflammation (including rheumatoid arthritis), ischemia, ischemic heart disease, lung tumor, micturition disorder, mittlesmerchz, neoplasm, nephrotoxicity, non-insulin dependent diabetes, obesity, obsessive/compulsive disorder, ocular hypertension, preclampsia, premature ejaculation, premature (preterm) labor, pulmonary disease, Raynaud's disease, renal disease, renal failure, male or female sexual dysfunction, septic shock, sleep disorder, spinal cord injury, thrombosis, urogenital tract infection or urolithiasis. sleep disorder, spinal cord injury, thrombosis, urogenital tract infection, urolithiasis. Particularly of interest is dysmenorrhoea (primary or secondary), more particularly, primary dysmenorrhoea.\n\n\nTherefore, a further aspect of the invention is the method of treatment of a mammal, including a human being, to treat a disorder for which a V1a antagonist is indicated, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, to the mammal. In particular, the compounds of formula (I) are useful in treating anxiety, cardiovascular disease (including angina, atherosclerosis, hypertension, heart failure, edema, hypernatremia), dysmenorrhoea (primary and secondary), endometriosis, emesis (including motion sickness), intrauterine growth retardation, inflammation (including rheumatoid arthritis), mittlesmerchz, preclampsia, premature ejaculation, premature (preterm) labour or Raynaud's disease. Even more particularly, they are useful in treating dysmenorrhoea (primary or secondary).\n\n\nA further aspect of the present invention is the use of a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a disorder for which a V1a receptor antagonist is indicated.\n\n\nAll of the compounds of the formula (I) can be prepared by the procedures described in the general methods presented below or by the specific methods described in the Examples section and the Preparations section, or by routine modifications thereof.

They may be obtained, for example, as solid plugs, powders, or films by methods such as precipitation, crystallisation, freeze drying, spray drying, or evaporative drying. Microwave or radio frequency drying may be used for this purpose.\n\n\nThey may be administered alone or in combination with one or more other compounds of the invention or in combination with one or more other drugs (or as any combination thereof). Generally, they will be administered as a formulation in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The term ‘excipient’ is used herein to describe any ingredient other than the compound(s) of the invention. The choice of excipient will to a large extent depend on factors such as the particular mode of administration, the effect of the excipient on solubility and stability, and the nature of the dosage form.\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical formulation including a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier. In a further embodiment there is provided the pharmaceutical formulation for administration either prophylactically or when pain commences.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for the delivery of compounds of the present invention and methods for their preparation will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Such compositions and methods for their preparation may be found, for example, in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n19th Edition (Mack Publishing Company, 1995).\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be administered orally. Oral administration may involve swallowing, so that the compound enters the gastrointestinal tract, or buccal or sublingual administration may be employed by which the compound enters the blood stream directly from the mouth.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for oral administration include solid formulations such as tablets, capsules containing particulates, liquids, or powders, lozenges (including liquid-filled), chews, multi- and nano-particulates, gels, solid solution, liposome, films, ovules, sprays and liquid formulations.\n\n\nLiquid formulations include suspensions, solutions, syrups and elixirs. Such formulations may be employed as fillers in soft or hard capsules and typically comprise a carrier, for example, water, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, methylcellulose, or a suitable oil, and one or more emulsifying agents and/or suspending agents. Liquid formulations may also be prepared by the reconstitution of a solid, for example, from a sachet.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may also be used in fast-dissolving, fast-disintegrating dosage forms such as those described in Expert Opinion in Therapeutic Patents, 11 (6), 981-986, by Liang and Chen (2001).\n\n\nFor tablet dosage forms, depending on dose, the drug may make up from 1 weight % to 80 weight % of the dosage form, more typically from 5 weight % to 60 weight % of the dosage form. In addition to the drug, tablets generally contain a disintegrant. Examples of disintegrants include sodium starch glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polyvinylpyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, lower alkyl-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, starch, pregelatinised starch and sodium alginate. Generally, the disintegrant will comprise from 1 weight % to 25 weight %, preferably from 5 weight to 20 weight % of the dosage form.\n\n\nBinders are generally used to impart cohesive qualities to a tablet formulation. Suitable binders include microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, sugars, polyethylene glycol, natural and synthetic gums, polyvinylpyrrolidone, pregelatinised starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Tablets may also contain diluents, such as lactose (monohydrate, spray-dried monohydrate, anhydrous and the like), mannitol, xylitol, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, starch and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate.\n\n\nTablets may also optionally comprise surface active agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbate 80, and glidants such as silicon dioxide and talc. When present, surface active agents may comprise from 0.2 weight % to 5 weight % of the tablet, and glidants may comprise from 0.2 weight % to 1 weight % of the tablet.\n\n\nTablets also generally contain lubricants such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, sodium stearyl fumarate, and mixtures of magnesium stearate with sodium lauryl sulphate. Lubricants generally comprise from 0.25 weight % to 10 weight %, preferably from 0.5 weight % to 3 weight % of the tablet.\n\n\nOther possible ingredients include anti-oxidants, colourants, flavouring agents, preservatives and taste-masking agents.\n\n\nExemplary tablets contain up to about 80% drug, from about 10 weight % to about 90 weight % binder, from about 0 weight % to about 85 weight % diluent, from about 2 weight % to about 10 weight % disintegrant, and from about 0.25 weight % to about 10 weight % lubricant.\n\n\nTablet blends may be compressed directly or by roller to form tablets. Tablet blends or portions of blends may alternatively be wet-, dry-, or melt-granulated, melt congealed, or extruded before tabletting. The final formulation may comprise one or more layers and may be coated or uncoated; it may even be encapsulated.\n\n\nThe formulation of tablets is discussed in \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets\n, Vol. 1, by H. Lieberman and L. Lachman (Marcel Dekker, New York, 1980).\n\n\nConsumable oral films for human or veterinary use are typically pliable water-soluble or water-swellable thin film dosage forms which may be rapidly dissolving or mucoadhesive and typically comprise a compound of formula (I), a film-forming polymer, a binder, a solvent, a humectant, a plasticiser, a stabiliser or emulsifier, a viscosity-modifying agent and a solvent. Some components of the formulation may perform more than one function.\n\n\nThe compound of formula (I) may be water-soluble or insoluble. A water-soluble compound typically comprises from 1 weight % to 80 weight %, more typically from 20 weight % to 50 weight %, of the solutes. Less soluble compounds may comprise a greater proportion of the composition, typically up to 88 weight % of the solutes. Alternatively, the compound of formula (I) may be in the form of multiparticulate beads.\n\n\nThe film-forming polymer may be selected from natural polysaccharides, proteins, or synthetic hydrocolloids and is typically present in the range 0.01 to 99 weight %, more typically in the range 30 to 80 weight %.\n\n\nOther possible ingredients include anti-oxidants, colorants, flavourings and flavour enhancers, preservatives, salivary stimulating agents, cooling agents, co-solvents (including oils), emollients, bulking agents, anti-foaming agents, surfactants and taste-masking agents.\n\n\nFilms in accordance with the invention are typically prepared by evaporative drying of thin aqueous films coated onto a peelable backing support or paper. This may be done in a drying oven or tunnel, typically a combined coater dryer, or by freeze-drying or vacuuming.\n\n\nSolid formulations for oral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\nSuitable modified release formulations for the purposes of the invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,106,864. Details of other suitable release technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles are to be found in \nPharmaceutical Technology On\n-\nline, \n25(2), 1-14, by Verma et al (2001). The use of chewing gum to achieve controlled release is described in WO 00/35298.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered directly into the blood stream, into muscle, or into an internal organ. Suitable means for parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, intraurethral, intrasternal, intracranial, intramuscular and subcutaneous. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques.\n\n\nParenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), but, for some applications, they may be more suitably formulated as a sterile non-aqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water.\n\n\nThe preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions, for example, by lyophilisation, may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe solubility of compounds of formula (I) used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents.\n\n\nFormulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. Thus compounds of the invention may be formulated as a solid, semi-solid, or thixotropic liquid for administration as an implanted depot providing modified release of the active compound. Examples of such formulations include drug-coated stents and poly(dl-lactic-coglycolic)acid (PGLA) microspheres.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered topically to the skin or mucosa, that is, dermally or transdermally. Typical formulations for this purpose include gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, ointments, dusting powders, dressings, foams, films, skin patches, wafers, implants, sponges, fibres, bandages and microemulsions. Liposomes may also be used. Typical carriers include alcohol, water, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Penetration enhancers may be incorporated—see, for example, J Pharm Sci, 88 (10), 955-958, by Finnin and Morgan (October 1999).\n\n\nOther means of topical administration include delivery by electroporation, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, sonophoresis and microneedle or needle-free (e.g. Powderject™, Bioject™, etc.) injection.\n\n\nFormulations for topical administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation, typically in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler or as an aerosol spray from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser (preferably an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane. For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin.\n\n\nThe pressurised container, pump, spray, atomizer, or nebuliser contains a solution or suspension of the compound(s) of the invention comprising, for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol, or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilising, or extending release of the active, a propellant(s) as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an oligolactic acid.\n\n\nPrior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronised to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenisation, or spray drying.\n\n\nCapsules (made, for example, from gelatin or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as l-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose.\n\n\nA suitable solution formulation for use in an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1 μg to 20 mg of the compound of the invention per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from 1 μl to 100 μl. A typical formulation may comprise a compound of formula (I), propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycol include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.\n\n\nSuitable flavours, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium, may be added to those formulations of the invention intended for inhaled/intranasal administration.\n\n\nFormulations for inhaled/intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release using, for example, PGLA. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\nIn the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a valve, which delivers a metered amount. The overall daily dose will typically be in the range 0.01 μg to 15 mg which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, as divided doses throughout the day.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be administered rectally or vaginally, for example, in the form of a suppository, pessary, or enema. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, but various alternatives may be used as appropriate.\n\n\nFormulations for rectal/vaginal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a micronised suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, biodegradable (e.g. absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (e.g. silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methyl cellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis.\n\n\nFormulations for ocular/aural administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted, or programmed release.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.\n\n\nDrug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubiliser. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in International Patent Applications Nos. WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148.\n\n\nInasmuch as it may desirable to administer a combination of active compounds, for example, for the purpose of treating a particular disease or condition, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound in accordance with the invention, may conveniently be combined in the form of a kit suitable for coadministration of the compositions.\n\n\nThus the kit of the invention comprises two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of formula (I) in accordance with the invention, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like.\n\n\nThe kit of the invention is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically comprises directions for administration and may be provided with a so-called memory aid.\n\n\nFor administration to human patients, the total daily dose of the compounds of the invention is typically in the range 0.01 mg to 15 mg depending, of course, on the mode of administration. The total daily dose may be administered in single or divided doses and may, at the physician's discretion, fall outside of the typical range given herein.\n\n\nThese dosages are based on an average human subject having a weight of about 60 kg to 70 kg. The physician will readily be able to determine doses for subjects whose weight falls outside this range, such as infants and the elderly.\n\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, references herein to “treatment” include references to curative, palliative and prophylactic treatment.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may be tested in the screens set out below:\n\n\n1.0 V\n1A \nFilter Binding Assay\n\n\n1.1 Membrane Preparation\n\n\nReceptor binding assays were performed on cellular membranes prepared from CHO cells stably expressing the human V\n1A \nreceptor, (CHO-hV\n1A\n). The CHO-hV\n1A \ncell line was kindly provided under a licensing agreement by Marc Thibonnier, Dept. of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio. CHO-hV\n1A \ncells were routinely maintained at 37° C. in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO\n2 \nin DMEM/Hams F12 nutrient mix supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 15 mM HEPES and 400 μg/ml G418. For bulk production of cell pellets, adherent CHO-hV\n1A \ncells were grown to confluency of 90-100% in 850 cm\n2 \nroller bottles containing a medium of DMEM/Hams F12 Nutrient Mix supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 15 mM HEPES. Confluent CHO-hV\n1A \ncells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested into ice cold PBS and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm. Cell pellets were stored at −80° C. until use. Cell pellets were thawed on ice and homogenised in membrane preparation buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nand supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail, (Roche). The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 rpm, 10 min, 4° C. and the supernatant was removed and stored on ice. The remaining pellet was homogenised and centrifuged as before. The supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 25,000×g for 30 min at 4° C. The pellet was resuspended in freezing buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nand 20% glycerol and stored in small aliquots at −80° C. until use. Protein concentration was determined using Bradford reagent and BSA as a standard.\n\n\n1.2 V\n1A \nFilter Binding\n\n\nProtein linearity followed by saturation binding studies were performed on each new batch of membrane. Membrane concentration was chosen that gave specific binding on the linear portion of the curve. Saturation binding studies were then performed using various concentrations of [\n3\nH]-arginine vasopressin, [\n3\nH]-AVP (0.05 nM-100 nM) and the K\nd \nand B\nmax \ndetermined.\n\n\nCompounds were tested for their effects on [\n3\nH]-AVP binding to CHO-hV\n1A \nmembranes, (\n3\nH-AVP; specific activity 65.5 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Sciences). Compounds were solubilised in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted to working concentration of 10% DMSO with assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nand 0.05% BSA. 25 μl compound and 25 μl [\n3\nH]-AVP, (final concentration at or below K\nd \ndetermined for membrane batch, typically 0.5 nM-0.6 nM) were added to a 96-well round bottom polypropylene plate. The binding reaction was initiated by the addition of 200 μl membrane and the plates were gently shaken for 60 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration using a Filtermate Cell Harvester (Packard Instruments) through a 96-well GF/B UniFilter Plate which had been presoaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine to prevent peptide sticking. The filters were washed three times with 1 ml ice cold wash buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.4 and 5 mM MgCl\n2\n. The plates were dried and 50 μl Microscint-0 (Packard instruments) was added to each well. The plates were sealed and counted on a TopCount Microplate Scintillation Counter (Packard Instruments). Non-specific binding (NSB) was determined using 1 μM unlabelled d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP ([β-mercapto-β,β-cyclopentamethylenepropionyl,0-Me-Tyr\n2\n,Arg\n8\n]-vasopressin) (βMCPVP), (Sigma). The radioligand binding data was analysed using a four parameter logistic equation with the min forced to 0%. The slope was free fitted and fell between −0.75 and −1.25 for valid curves. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the mean NSB cpm from the mean Total cpm. For test compounds the amount of ligand bound to the receptor was expressed as % bound=(sample cpm−mean NSB cpm)/specific binding cpm×100. The % bound was plotted against the concentration of test compound and a sigmoidal curve was fitted. The inhibitory dissociation constant (K\ni\n) was calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation: K\ni\n=IC\n50\n/(1+[L]/K\nd\n) where [L] is the concentration of ligand present in the well and K\nd \nis the dissociation constant of the radioligand obtained from Scatchard plot analysis.\n\n\n2.0 V\n1A \nFunctional Assay; Inhibition of AVP/V\n1A\n-R Mediated Ca\n2+\nMobilization b FLIPR (Fluorescent Imaging Plate Reader) (Molecular Devices)\n\n\nIntracellular calcium release was measured in CHO-hV\n1A \ncells using FLIPR, which allows the rapid detection of calcium following receptor activation. The CHO-hV\n1A \ncell line was kindly provided under a licensing agreement by Marc Thibonnier, Dept. of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio. CHO-V\n1A \ncells were routinely maintained at 37° C. in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO\n2 \nin DMEM/Hams F12 nutrient mix supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 15 mM HEPES and 400 μg/ml G418. On the afternoon before the assay cells were plated at a density of 20,000 cells per well into black sterile 96-well plates with clear bottoms to allow cell inspection and fluorescence measurements from the bottom of each well. Wash buffer containing Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) and 2.5 mM probenecid and loading dye consisting of cell culture medium containing 4 μM Fluo-3-AM (dissolved in DMSO and pluronic acid), (Molecular Probes) and 2.5 mM probenecid was prepared fresh on the day of assay. Compounds were solubilised in DMSO and diluted in assay buffer consisting of DPBS containing 1% DMSO, 0.1% BSA and 2.5 mM probenecid. The cells were incubated with 100 μl loading dye per well for 1 hour at 37° C. in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO\n2\n. After dye loading the cells were washed three times in 100 μl wash buffer using a Denley plate washer. 100 μl wash buffer was left in each well. Intracellular fluorescence was measured using FLIPR. Fluorescence readings were obtained at 2 s intervals with 50 μl of the test compound added after 30 s. An additional 155 measurements at 2 s intervals were then taken to detect any compound agonistic activity. 50 μl of arginine vasopressin (AVP) was then added so that the final assay volume was 200 μl. Further fluorescence readings were collected at 1 s intervals for 120 s. Responses were measured as peak fluorescence intensity (FI). For pharmacological characterization a basal FI was subtracted from each fluorescence response. For AVP dose response curves, each response was expressed as a % of the response to the highest concentration of AVP in that row. For IC\n50 \ndeterminations, each response was expressed as a % of the response to AVP. IC50 values were converted to a modified K\nb \nvalue using the Cheng-Prusoff equation which takes into account the agonist concentration, [A], the agonist EC\n50 \nand the slope: K\nb\n=IC\n50\n/(2+[A]/A\n50\n]\nn\n)\n1/n\n−1 where [A] is the concentration of AVP, A\n50 \nis the EC\n50 \nof AVP from the dose response curve and n=slope of the AVP dose response curve.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with one or more other compounds of the invention or in combination with one or more other drugs (or as any combination thereof).

Tris-(2-aminoethyl)amine polystyrene was added and the mixture was stirred for an hour. It was then washed with 1N sodium hydroxide solution. The aqueous solution was extracted with dichloromethane (2×) and the combined organic solutions were concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude products were purified by column chromatography on silica gel using ethyl acetate:methanol:0.88 ammonia (90:10:1) as eluant, to afford the title compounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEx No\n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n396\n\n\nW = 2-CF\n3\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, CDCl\n3\n): δ 1.61-1.76 (m, 1H), 1.79-1.98 (m, 3H),\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2.62-2.80 (m, 1H), 2.84-2.97 (m, 2H), 3.42 (m, 1H), 4.60 (m, 1H), 5.62 (d, 2H), 6.99 (m,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2H), 7.20-7.55 (m, 6H), 7.59 (m, 1H), 7.66 (m, 1H).
