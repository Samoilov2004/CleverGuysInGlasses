Description\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Field\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a compound or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof that has an excellent antagonistic effect on a neurokinin NK\n1\n receptor, a neurokinin NK\n2\n receptor, and a muscarine M\n3\n receptor and is useful as a therapeutic agent for bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or the like.\n\n\n \nBackground Art\n\n\n \n \n \nIn bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchoconstriction, airway inflammation, mucus secretion, coughing, and the like increase. Substance P or neurokinin A is associated with an airway contracting effect, an inflammatory effect, coughing, and mucus secretion. A compound that antagonizes receptors of both substance P and neurokinin A (a neurokinin NK\n1\n receptor and a neurokinin NK\n2\n receptor) may suppress the above-mentioned physiological effects (Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2). Although nonpeptidic low-molecular weight compounds that antagonize both the neurokinin NK\n1\n receptor and the neurokinin NK\n2\n receptor have been disclosed (Patent Documents 1 and 2), the use of the compounds as pharmaceuticals has not been approved. Meanwhile, acetylcholine exhibits a potent airway contracting effect by acting on a muscarinic M\n3\n receptor (Non-Patent Document 3). Compounds that antagonize the muscarinic M\n3\n receptor have a bronchodilating effect (Patent Documents 3, 4, and 5) and are used as bronchodilating agents (Non-Patent Document 4). It has been described that a bronchodilating effect which is more potent than the bronchodilating effect exhibited by antagonizing each of the receptors individually is exhibited by antagonizing both the muscarinic M\n3\n receptor and the neurokinin receptors (Patent Document 6). However, since no compound that antagonizes the neurokinin NK\n1\n receptor and the neurokinin NK\n2\n receptor has been marketed as a therapeutic agent for bronchial asthma or COPD, single agents cannot be used in combination. There has been demand for a single compound which has potent bronchodilating, anti-inflammatory, antiussive, and expectorant effects by antagonizing all of the neurokinin NK\n1\n receptor, the neurokinin NK\n2\n receptor, and the muscarinic M\n3\n receptor.\n\n\n \nCitation list\n\n\nPatent Document\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nPatent Document 1: \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6511975\n \n \n\n\nPatent Document 2: \n \nU.S. Patent No. 7365067\n \n \n\n\nPatent Document 3: \n \nU.S. Patent No. 2004/167167\n \n \n\n\nPatent Document 4: \n \nU.S. Patent No. 2005/203131\n \n \n\n\nPatent Document 5: \n \nU.S. Patent No. 2006/281740\n \n \n\n\nPatent Document 6: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. \n \n2006-160639\n \n \n\n\n\n\nNon-Patent Document\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nNon-Patent Document 1: \nAmerican Review of Respiratory Disease, 1991, vol.144, 1187-1198\n \n\n\nNon-Patent Document 2: \nAmerican Review of Respiratory Disease, 1991, vol.144, 1391-1399\n \n\n\nNon-Patent Document 3: \nLife Sciences, 1993, vol.52, 521-527\n \n\n\nNon-Patent Document 4: \nEuropean Journal of Pharmacology, 2006, vol.533, 36-39\n \n\n\n\n\nDisclosure of the Invention\n\n\nProblems to be Solved by the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe inventors of the present invention assiduously studied the synthesis of a single compound that has an antagonistic effect on all of the neurokinin NK\n1\n receptor, the neurokinin NK\n2\n receptor, and the muscarine M\n3\n receptor as well as a pharmacological activity over a long period.
