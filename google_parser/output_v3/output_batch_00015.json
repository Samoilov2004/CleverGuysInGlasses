The need and choice of protecting groups for a particular reaction is known to those skilled in the art and depends on the nature of the functional group to be protected (hydroxyl group, amino group, etc.), the structure and stability of the molecule of which the substituent is a part and the reaction conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWell known protecting groups that meet these conditions and their introduction and removal are described, for example, in \nMcOmie, \"\nProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\n\", Plenum Press, London, New York (1973\n); and \nGreene and Wuts, \"\nProtective'Groups in Organic Synthesis\n\", John Wiley and Sons, Inc, New York (1999\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above mentioned reactions are carried out according to standard methods, in the presence or absence of diluent, preferably such as are inert to the reagents and are solvents thereof, of catalysts, condensing or said other agents respectively and/or inert atmospheres, at low temperatures, room temperature or elevated temperature (preferably at or near the boiling point of the solvents used), and at atmospheric or super-atmospheric pressure.

The aforesaid possible isomers or mixtures thereof are within the purview of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny resulting mixtures of isomers can be separated on the basis of the physico-chemical differences of the constituents, into the pure geometric or optical isomers, diastereoisomers, racemates, for example by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny resulting racemates of final products or intermediates can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, e.g. by separation of the diastereoisomeric salts thereof, obtained with an optically active acid or base, and liberating the optically active acidic or basic compound. The carboxylic acid intermediates can thus be resolved into their optical antipodes e.g. by fractional crystallization of D- or L-(alpha-methylbenzylamine, cinchonidine, cinchonine, quinine, quinidine, ephedrine, dehydroabietylamine, brucine or strychnine)-salts.

Salts may be formed using conventional methods, advantageously in the presence of an ethereal or alcoholic solvent, such as a lower alkanol. From the solutions of the latter, the salts may be precipitated with ethers, e.g. diethyl ether. Resulting salts may be converted into the free compounds by treatment with acids. These or other salts can also be used for purification of the compounds obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention having basic groups can be converted into acid addition salts, especially pharmaceutically acceptable salts. These are formed, for example, with inorganic acids, such as mineral acids, for example sulfuric acid, a phosphoric or hydrohalic acid, or with organic carboxylic acids, such as (C\n1-4\n)alkanecarboxylic acids which, for example, are unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, for example acetic acid, such as saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, succinic, maleic or fumaric acid, such as hydroxy-carboxylic acids, for example glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid, such as amino acids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid, or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C\n1-4\n)alkyl-sulfonic acids (for example methanesulfonic acid) or arylsulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example by halogen).

A therapeutically effective amount in vivo may range depending on the route of administration, between about 0.1 and 500 mg/kg or between about 1 and 500 mg/kg, preferably between about 5 and 100 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activity of a compound according to the invention may be assessed by the following methods or by following methods well described in the art (e.g. \nPeters G. et al. J. Biol. Chem, 2000, 275, 18201-09\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the PTP-1 B inhibitory activity \nin vitro\n may be determined as follows:\n\n \n \n \nAssessment of human PTP-1 B (hPTP-1 B) activity in the presence of various agents is determined by measuring the amount of inorganic phosphate released from a phosphopeptide substrate using a 96-well microtiter plate format. The assay (100 µL) is performed in an assay buffer comprised of 50 mM TRIS (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM DTT at ambient temperature. The assay is typically performed in the presence of 0.4% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). However, concentrations as high as 10% are used with certain poorly soluble compounds. A typical reaction is initiated by the addition of 0.4 pmoles of hPTP-1B (amino acids 1-411) to wells containing assay buffer, 3 nmoles of the synthetic phosphopeptide substrate (GNGDpYMPMSPKS), and the test compound. After 10 min, 180 µL malachite green reagent (0.88 mM malachite green, 8.2 mM ammonium molybdate, aqueous 1 N HCl, and 0.01% Triton X-1 00) is added to terminate the reaction. Inorganic phosphate, a product of the enzyme reaction, is quantitiated after 15 min as the green color resulting from complexing with the Malichite reagent and is determined as an A\n620\n using a Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA) SpectraMAX Plus spectrophotometer. Test compounds are solubilized in 100 % DMSO (Sigma, D-8779) and diluted in DMSO. Activity is defined as the net change in absorbance resulting from the activity of the uninhibited hPTP-1B\n[1-411]\n minus that of a tube with acid-inactivated hPTP-1 B\n[1-411]\n.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe hPTP-1 B\n[1-411]\n is cloned by PCR from a human hippocampal cDNA library (Clonetech) and inserted into a pET 19-b vector (Novagen) at the Nco1 restriction site. E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) is transformed with this clone and stored as a stock culture in 20% glycerol at-80° C. For enzyme production, a stock culture is inoculated into Lb/Amp and grown at 37°C. Expression of PTP-1B is initiated by induction with 1 mM IPTG after the culture had reached an OD\n600\n = 0.6. After 4h, the bacterial pellet is collected by centrifugation. Cells are resuspended in 70mL lysis buffer (50mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 5mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH7.6), incubated on ice for 30 min then sonicated (4 X 10sec bursts at full power). The lysate is centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 60 min and the supernatant is buffer exchanged and purified on a cation exchange POROS 20SP column followed by an anion exchange Source 30Q (Pharmacia) column, using linear NaCl gradient elutions. Enzyme is pooled, adjusted to 1mg/mL and frozen at -80°C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the assessment of human PTP-1 B activity in the presence of various agents may be determined by measuring the hydrolysis products of known competing substrates. For example, cleavage of substrate para-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) results in the release of the yellow-colored para-nitrophenol (pNP) which can be monitored in real time using a spectrophotometer. Likewise, the hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate ammonium salt (DiFMUP) results in the release of the fluorescent DiFMU which can be readily followed in a continuous mode with a fluorescence reader (\nAnal. Biochem. 273, 41, 1999\n; \nAnal. Biochem. 338, 32, 2005\n):\n\n\n \n\n\npNPP Assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds were incubated with 1 nM recombinant human PTP-1 B\n[1-298]\n or PTP-1 B\n[1-322]\n in buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM DTT, 0.05% NP-40 for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction is initiated by the addition of pNPP (2 mM final concentration) and run for 120 min at room temperature. Reactions are quenched with 5 N NaOH. Absorbance at 405 nm is measured using any standard 384 well plate reader.\n\n\n \n\n\nDiFMUP Assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds are incubated with 1 nM recombinant human PTP-1 B\n[1.298]\n or PTP-1 B\n[1-322]\n in buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM DTT, 0.05% NP-40 (or 0.001.% BSA) for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction is initiated by the addition of DiFMUP (6 µM final concentration) and run kinetically on fluorescence plate reader at 355 nm excitation and 460 nm emission wavelengths. Reaction rates over 15 min are used to calculate inhibition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPTP-1 B\n[1-298]\n is expressed in \nE. coli\n BL21(DE3) containing plasmids constucted using pET19b vectors (Novagen). The bacteria is grown in minimal media using an \"On Demand\" Fed-batch strategy. Typically, a 5.5 liter fermentation is initiated in Fed-batch mode and grown overnight unattended at 37°C. Optical densities varied between 20-24 OD\n600\n and the cultrures are induced at 30°C with IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The bacterial cells are harvested 8 hours later and yield 200-350 gm (wet weight). The cells are frozen as pellets and stored at -80°C until use. All steps are performed at 4°C unless noted. Cells (∼15 g) are thawed briefly at 37°C and resuspended in 50 mL of lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, pH 8.0 containing one tablet of Complete (EDTA-free) protease cocktail (Boehringer Mannheim), 100 µM PMSF and 100 µg/mL DNase I. The cells are lysed by sonication (4 x 10 second burst, full power) using a Virsonic 60 (Virtus). The pellet is collected at 35,000 x g, resuspended in 25 mL of lysis buffer using a Polytron and collected as before. The two supernatants are combined and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 x g. The soluble lysate could be stored at this stage at -80 °C or used for further purification. Diafiltration using a 10 kD MWCO membrane is used to buffer exchange the protein and reduce the NaCl concentration prior to cation exchange chromatography. Diafiltration buffer contained 50 mM MES, 75 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, pH 6.5. Soluble supernatant is then loaded onto a POROS 20 SP (1 x 10 cm) column equilibrated with cation exchange buffer (50 mM MES and 75 mM NaCl, pH 6.5) at a rate of 20 mL/min. An analytical column (4.6 x 100 mm) is run in a similar fashion except the flow rate was reduced to 10 mL/min. Protein is eluted from the column using a linear salt gradient (75-500 mM NaCl in 25 CV). Fractions containing PTP-1 B\n[1-298]\n are identified and pooled according to SDS-PAGE analyses. Final purification is performed using Sephacryl S-100 HR (Pharmacia). The column (2.6 x 35 cm) is equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM DTT, pH 7.5 and run at a flow rate of 2 mL/min. The final protein is pooled and concentrated to -5 mg/mL using an Ultrafree-15 concentrator (Millipore) with a MWCO 10,000. The concentrated protein is stored at -80 °C until use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetitive binding to the active site of the enzyme may be determined as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigand binding is detected by acquiring \n1\nH-\n15\nN HSQC spectra on 250 µL of 0.15 mM PTP-1B\n[1-298]\n in the presence and absence of added compound (1-2 mM). The binding is determined by the observation of \n15\nN- or \n1\nH-amide chemical shift changes in two dimensional HSQC spectra upon the addition of a compound to \n15\nN-label protein. Because of the \n15\nN spectral editing, no signal from the ligand is observed, only protein signals. Thus, binding can be detected at high compound concentrations. Compounds which caused a pattern of chemical shift changes similar to the changes seen with known active site binders are considered positive.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll proteins are expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) containing plasmids constructed using pET19b vectors (Novagen). Uniformly \n15\nN-labeled PTP-1B\n1-298\n is produced by growth of bacterial on minimal media containing \n15\nN-labeled ammonium chloride. All purification steps are performed at 4°C. Cells (∼15 g) are thawed briefly at 37°C and resuspended in 50 mL of lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, pH 8.0 containing one tablet of Complete (EDTA-free) protease cocktail (Boehringer Mannheim), 100 µM PMSF and 100 µg/mL DNase I. The cells are lysed by sonication. The pellet is collected at 35,000 x g, resuspended in 25 mL of lysis buffer using a Polytron and collected as before. The two supernatants are combined and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 x g. Diafiltration using a 10 kD MWCO membrane is used to buffer exchange the protein and reduce the NaCl concentration prior to cation exchange chromatography. Diafiltration buffer contained 50 mM MES, 75 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, pH 6.5. Soluble supernatant is then loaded onto a POROS 20 SP (1 x 10 cm) column equilibrated with cation exchange buffer (50 mM MES and 75 mM NaCl, pH 6.5) at a rate of 20 mL/min. Protein is eluted from the column using a linear salt gradient (75-500 mM NaCl in 25 CV). Fractions containing PTP-1B's are identified and pooled according to SDS-PAGE analyses. PTP-1B\n1-298\n is further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a POROS 20 HQ column (1 x 10 cm). The pool from cation exchange chromatography is concentrated and buffer exchanged in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 75 mM NaCl and 5 mM DTT. Protein is loaded onto column at 20 mL/min and eluted using a linear NaCl gradient (75-500 mM in 25 CV). Final purification is performed using Sephacryl S=100 HR (Pharmacia)(50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM DTT, pH 7.5). The NMR samples are composed of uniformly \n15\nN-labeled PTP-1B\n1-298\n (0.15 mM) and inhibitor (1-2 mM) in a 10%D\n2\nO/90%H\n2\nO Bis-Tris-d\n19\n buffer (50 mM, pH = 6.5) solution containing NaCl (50 mM), DL-1, 4-Dithiothreitol-d\n10\n (5mM) and Sodium azide (0.02%).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \n1\nH-\n15\nN HSQC NMR spectra are recorded at 20°C, on Bruker DRX500 or DMX600 NMR spectrometers. In all NMR experiments, pulsed field gradients are applied to afford the suppression of solvent signal. Quadrature detection in the indirectly detected dimensions is accomplished by using the States-TPPI method. The data are processed using Bruker software and analyzed using NMRCompass software (MSI) on Silicon Graphics computers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glucose and insulin lowering activity \nin vivo\n may be evaluated as follows:\n\n \n \n \nAdult male C57BL ob/ob mice (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME) at the age of 11 weeks are housed six per cage in a reversed light cycle room (light on from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) and given access to Purina rodent chow and water \nad libitum.\n On day 1 tail blood samples are taken at 8:00 am and plasma glucose levels are determined. The animals are randomly assigned to the control and compound groups. The means of plasma glucose values of the groups are matched. Animals are then orally dosed with vehicle (0.5% carboxymethylcellulose with 0.2% Tween-80) or compounds (at 30 mg/kg) in vehicle. The mice are dosed daily for a total of 3 days. On day 4 basal blood samples are taken. The plasma samples are analyzed for glucose concentrations using a YSI2700 Dual Channel Biochemistry Analyzer (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH) and insulin concentrations using an ELISA assay.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe following Examples illustrate the invention.
