Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel analogues of neuropeptide Y, pharmaceutical compositions containing the same, pharmaceutical formulations containing the same, and method of treating diseases or conditions mediated by neuropeptide Y-receptor binding. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel analogues of neuropeptide Y having proline substitution at position 34 and other substitution(s) as defined herein that selectively bind to the neuropeptide Y1 receptor subtype compared to the neuropeptide Y2 receptor subtype.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nNeuropeptide Y (“NPY”), a 36 amino acid peptide neurotransmitter, is a member of the pancreatic family of peptides and shares significant sequence homology with pancreatic polypeptide and peptide YY. Human neuropeptide Y (“hNPY”) has the sequence: H-Tyr-Pro-Ser-Lys-Pro-Asp-Asn-Pro-Gly-Glu-Asp-Ala-Pro-Ala-Glu-Asp-Met-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Ser-Ala-Leu-Arg-His-Tyr-Ile-Asn-Leu-Ile-Thr-Arg-Gln-Arg-Tyr-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:1). NPY was discovered, isolated and sequenced from porcine brain and was named “neuropeptide Y” due to its isolation from neural tissue and the presence of tyrosine as both the amino and carboxy terminal amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNPY and the other members of its family of peptides all feature a tertiary structure consisting of an N-terminal polyproline helix and an amphiphilic α-helix, connected with a (β-turn, creating a hairpin-like loop, which is sometimes referred to as the “pancreatic polypeptide fold.” The helices are kept together by hydrophobic interactions. The amidated C-terminal end projects away from the hairpin loop.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubsequent to its discovery, NPY was identified as being the most abundant peptide in the central nervous system with widespread distribution including the cortex, brainstem, hippocampus, hypotahlamus, amygdala, and thalamus, as well as being present in the peripheral nervous system in sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNPY seems to fulfill the main neurotransmitter criteria, since it is stored in synaptic granules, is released upon electrical nerve stimulation, and acts at specific receptors. It is clear that NPY is an important messenger in its own right, probably in the brain, where NPY potently inhibits the activity of adenylate cyclase and induces an increase in the intracellular levels of calcium. Central injection of NPY results in blood pressure changes, increased feeding, increased fat storage, elevated blood sugar and insulin, decreased locomotor activity, reduced body temperature, and catalepsy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNPY appears to interact with a family of closely related receptors. These receptors are generally classified into several subtypes based upon the ability of different tissues and receptors to bind different fragments of neuropeptide Y and the closely related PYY. The Y1 receptor subtype (“NPY-Y1 receptor”) appears to be the major vascular NPY receptor. The Y2 receptor subtype (“NPY-Y2 receptor”) can also occur postjunctionally on vascular smooth muscle. The Y3 receptor subtype (“NPY-Y3 receptor”) appears to be NPY-specific, not binding PYY. This receptor is likely to be present in the adrenal tissues, medulla, heart, and brain stem, among other areas. For a review of neuropeptide Y and neuropeptide Y receptors, see, e.g., C. Wahlestedt and D. Reis, Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology, 33:309-352 (1993). Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) Publication No. WO 95/00161 describes a series of NPY antagonists and agonists for controlling biological activities such as obesity and cardiovascular function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEuropean Pat. No. 0759441 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,337 report that physiological disorders related to an excess of neuropeptide Y include: disorders or diseases pertaining to the heart, blood vessels or the renal system, such as vasospasm, heart failure, shock, cardiac hypertrophy, increased blood pressure, angina, myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, arrythmia, peripheral vascular disease, and abnormal renal conditions such as impaired flow of fluid, abnormal mass transport, or renal failure; conditions related to increased sympathetic nerve activity for example, during or after coronary artery surgery, and operations and surgery in the gastrointestinal tract; cerebral diseases and diseases related to the central nervous system, such as cerebral infarction, neurodegeneration, epilepsy, stroke, and conditions related to stroke, cerebral vasospasm and hemmorrhage, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and dementia; conditions related to pain or nociception; diseases related to abnormal gastrointenstinal motility and secretion, such as different forms of ileus, urinary incontinence, and Crohn's disease; abnormal drink and food intake disorders, such as anorexia and metabolic disorders; diseases related to sexual dysfunction and reproductive disorders; conditions or disorders associated with inflammation; respiratory diseases, such as asthma and conditions related to asthma and bronchoconstriction; and diseases related to abnormal hormone release, such as leutinizing hormone, growth hormone, insulin, and prolactin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT Publication No. WO 02/43776 by Reubi reports on the use of compounds that bind the NPY-Y1 receptor for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the diagnosis or treatment of tumors expressing the NPY-Y1 receptor, in particular breast cancer, ovarian cancer and glioblastoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are numerous patents and patent publications that disclose certain NPY analogues and uses thereof, such as U.S. Pat. No. 5,026,685, U.S. Pat. No. 5,328,899, U.S. Pat. No. 6,511,984, PCT Publication No. WO 02/43776, PCT Publication No. WO2007/039318, etc. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there remains a continuing need for NPY analogues having improved potency and/or selectivity and/or in vivo or in vitro characteristics.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides peptide variants of hNPY of the following formula

The homogenates were washed twice by centrifugation (39,000 g/10 min), and the final pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, containing 2.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo., USA), and 0.1% BSA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor assay, aliquots (0.4 ml) of the foregoing suspensions were incubated with 0.05 nM [\n125\nI]PYY (2200 Ci/mmol, Perkin-Elmer, Boston, Mass.), with and without 0.05 ml of unlabeled competing test peptides. After a 100 min incubation (25° C.), the bound [\n125\nI]PYY was separated from the free by rapid filtration through GF/C filters (Brandel, Gaithersburg, Md., USA), which had been previously soaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine. The filters were then washed three times with 5-ml aliquots of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, and the bound radioactivity trapped on the filters was counted by gamma spectrometry (Wallac LKB, Gaithersburg, Md., USA). Specific binding was defined as the total [\n125\nI]PYY bound minus that bound in the presence of 1000 nM PYY (Bachem, Torrence, Calif., USA). Inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated using the well-known Cheng-Prusoff equation, and said data, together with selectivity of said compounds with respect to the NPY-Y1 and the NPY-Y2, are given in Table 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the compounds of Examples 1-32 was subjected to the immediately foregoing radioligand assays, and nearly all of said compounds were found to have Ki of under 100 nM, as well as some of the exemplified compounds having Ki values in sub-nM range. It was also found that nearly all of said compounds highly selectively bind to the NPY-Y1 compared to the NPY-Y2.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample No.\n\n\nKi (nM) for Y1\n\n\nKi (nM) for Y2\n\n\nSelectivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n307.67\n\n\n367\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n120.44\n\n\n643\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n3.56\n\n\n668\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n19.67\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n4.79\n\n\n133\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n10.65\n\n\n19\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n108.38\n\n\n13\n\n\nY2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n13.66\n\n\n15\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n6.68\n\n\n10\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n54.26\n\n\n11\n\n\nY2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n20.35\n\n\n26\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n10.00\n\n\n611\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n6.18\n\n\n383\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n22.50\n\n\n270\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n4.79\n\n\n40\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n5.68\n\n\n23\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n11.82\n\n\n41\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n2.94\n\n\n74\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n19\n\n\n3.44\n\n\n33\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n1.49\n\n\n75\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n0.55\n\n\n138\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n0.73\n\n\n80\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n23\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n24\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n87.47\n\n\n227\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n26\n\n\n35.17\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n10.35\n\n\n292\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n29.67\n\n\n267\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n53.58\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n187.50\n\n\n787\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n31\n\n\n8.24\n\n\n107\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n21.57\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n0.84\n\n\n672\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdministration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptides of this invention can be provided in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of such salts include, but are not limited to, those formed with organic acids (e.g., acetic, lactic, maleic, citric, malic, ascorbic, succinic, benzoic, methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, or pamoic acid), inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid), and polymeric acids (e.g., tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose, polylactic, polyglycolic, or copolymers of polylactic-glycolic acids). A typical method of making a salt of a peptide of the present invention is well known in the art and can be accomplished by standard methods of salt exchange. Accordingly, the TFA salt of a peptide of the present invention (the TFA salt results from the purification of the peptide by using preparative HPLC eluting with TFA containing buffer solutions) can be converted into another salt, such as an acetate salt, by dissolving the peptide in a small amount of 0.25 N acetic acid aqueous solution. The resulting solution is applied to a semi-prep HPLC column (Zorbax, 300 SB, C-8). The column is eluted with (1) 0.1N ammonium acetate aqueous solution for 0.5 hours, (2) 0.25N acetic acid aqueous solution for 0.5 hours, and (3) a linear gradient (20% to 100% of solution B over 30 min) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min (solution A is 0.25N acetic acid aqueous solution; solution B is 0.25N acetic acid in acetonitrile/water, 80:20). The fractions containing the peptide are collected and lyophilized to dryness.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage of active ingredient in the compositions of this invention may be varied, however, it is necessary that the amount of the active ingredient be such that a suitable dosage form is obtained. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, the route of administration, and the duration of the treatment. In general, an effective dosage for the activities of this invention is in the range of 1×10\n−7 \nto 200 mg/kg/day, preferably 1×\n10\n \n−4 \nto 100 mg/kg/day, which can be administered as a single dose or divided into multiple doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention can be administered by oral, parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous injection, or implant), nasal, vaginal, rectal, sublingual, or topical routes of administration, and can be formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to provide dosage forms appropriate for each route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is admixed with at least one inert pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as sucrose, lactose, or starch. Such dosage forms can also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than such inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include, without limitation, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, elixirs, and the like, containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Besides such inert diluents, compositions can also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations according to this invention for parenteral administration include, without limitation, sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, and the like. Examples of non-aqueous solvents or vehicles include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtering through a bacteria-retaining filter, incorporating sterilizing agents, irradiating, or heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium, immediately before use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which may contain, in addition to the active substance, excipients such as coca butter or a suppository wax.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for nasal or sublingual administration are also prepared with standard excipients well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, a compound of this invention can be administered in a sustained release composition such as those described in the following patents and patent applications.
