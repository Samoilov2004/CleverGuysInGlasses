This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds. The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are particularly well suited for inhibiting ICE activity and consequently, may be advantageously used as agents against interleukin-1- (“IL-1”), apoptosis-, interferon gamma inducing factor- (“IGIF”) and interferon-γ- (“IFN-γ”) mediated diseases, including inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, destructive bone, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases and degenerative diseases. This invention also relates to methods for inhibiting ICE activity, and decreasing IGIF production and IFN-γ production and methods for treating interleukin-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF- and IFN-γ-mediated diseases using the compounds and compositions of this invention. This invention also relates to methods of preparing N-acylamino compounds.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nInterleukin 1 (“IL-1”) is a major pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory protein that stimulates fibroblast differentiation and proliferation, the production of prostaglandins, collagenase and phospholipase by synovial cells and chondrocytes, basophil and eosinophil degranulation and neutrophil activation. Oppenheim, J. H. et al, \nImmunology Today, \n7, pp. 45-56 (1986). As such, it is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic and acute inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, IL-1 is both a mediator of inflammatory symptoms and of the destruction of the cartilage proteoglycan in afflicted joints. Wood, D. D. et al., \nArthritis Rheum. \n26, 975, (1983); Pettipher, E. J. et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n71, 295 (1986); Arend, W. P. and Dayer, J. M., \nArthritis Rheum. \n38, 151 (1995). IL-1 is also a highly potent bone resorption agent. Jandiski, J. J., \nJ. Oral Path \n17, 145 (1988); Dewhirst, F. E. et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n8, 2562 1985). It is alternately referred to as “osteoclast activating factor” in destructive bone diseases such as osteoarthritis and multiple myeloma. Bataille, R. et al., \nInt. J. Clin. Lab. Res. \n21(4), 283 (1992). In certain proliferative disorders, such as acute myelogenous leukemia and multiple myeloma, IL-1 can promote tumor cell growth and adhesion. Bani, M. R., \nJ. Natl. Cancer Inst. \n83, 123 (1991); Vidal-Vanaclocha, F., \nCancer Res. \n54, 2667 (1994). In these disorders, IL-1 also stimulates production of other cytokines such as IL-6, which can modulate tumor development (Tartour et al., \nCancer Res. \n54, 6243 (1994). IL-1 is predominantly produced by peripheral blood monocytes as part of the inflammatory response and exists in two distinct agonist forms, IL-1α and IL-1β. Mosely, B. S. et al., \nProc. Nat, Acad. Sci., \n84, pp. 4572-4576 (1987); Lonnemann, G. et al., \nEur. J. Immunol., \n19, pp. 1531-1536 (1989).\n\n\nIL-1β is synthesized as a biologically inactive precursor, pIL-1β. pIL-1β lacks a conventional leader sequence and is not processed by a signal peptidase. March, C. J., \nNature, \n315, pp. 641-647 (1985). Instead, pIL-1β is cleaved by interleukin-1β converting enzyme (“ICE”) between Asp-116 and Ala-117 to produce the biologically active C-terminal fragment found in human serum and synovial fluid. Sleath, P. R., et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n265, pp. 14526-14528 (1992); A. D. Howard et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n147, pp. 2964-2969 (1991). ICE is a cysteine protease localized primarily in monocytes. It converts precursor IL-43 to the mature form. Black, R. A. et al., \nFEBS Lett., \n247, pp. 386-390 (1989); Kostura, M. J. et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, \n86, pp. 5227-5231 (1989). Processing by ICE is also necessary for the transport of mature IL-1β through the cell membrane.\n\n\nICE, or its homologs, also appears to be involved in the regulation of programmed cell death or apoptosis. Yuan, J. et al., \nCell, \n75, pp. 641-652 (1993); Miura, M. et al., \nCell, \n75, pp. 653-660 (1993); Nett-Fiordalisi, M. A. et al., \nJ. Cell Biochem., \n17B, p. 117 (1993). In particular, ICE or ICE homologs are thought to be associated with the regulation of apoptosis in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Marx, J. and M. Baringa, \nScience, \n259, pp. 760-762 (1993); Gagliardini, V. et al., \nScience, \n263, pp. 826-828 (1994). Therapeutic applications for inhibition of apoptosis may include treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, spinal atrophy, and aging.\n\n\nICE has been demonstrated to mediate apoptosis (programmed cell death) in certain tissue types. Steller, H., \nScience, \n267, p. 1445 (1995); Whyte, M. and Evan, G., \nNature, \n376, p. 17 (1995); Martin, S. J. and Green, D. R., \nCell, \n82, p. 349 (1995); Alnemri, E. S., et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n270, p. 4312 (1995); Yuan, J. \nCurr. Opin. Cell Biol., \n7, p. 211 (1995). A transgenic mouse with a disruption of the ICE gene is deficient in Fas-mediated apoptosis (Kuida, K. et al., \nScience \n267, 2000 (1995)). This activity of ICE is distinct from its role as the processing enzyme for pro-IL1β. It is conceivable that in certain tissue types, inhibition of ICE may not affect secretion of mature IL-1β, but may inhibit apoptosis.\n\n\nEnzymatically active ICE has been previously described as a heterodimer composed of two subunits, p20 and p10 (20 kDa and 10 kDa molecular weight, respectively). These subunits are derived from a 45 kDa proenzyme (p45) by way of a p30 form, through an activation mechanism that is autocatalytic. Thornberry, N. A. et al., \nNature, \n356, pp. 768-774 (1992). The ICE proenzyme has been divided into several functional domains: a prodomain (p14), a p22/20 subunit, a polypeptide linker and a p10 subunit. Thornberry et al., supra; Casano et al., \nGenomics, \n20, pp. 474-481 (1994).\n\n\nFull length p45 has been characterized by its cDNA and amino acid sequences. PCT patent applications WO 91/15577 and WO 94/00154. The p20 and p10 cDNA and amino acid sequences are also known. Thornberry et al., supra. Murine and rat ICE have also been sequenced and cloned. They have high amino acid and nucleic acid sequence homology to human ICE. Miller, D. K. et al., \nAnn. N.Y. Acad. Sci., \n696, pp. 133-148 (1993); Molineaux, S. M. et al., \nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci., \n90, pp. 1809-1813 (1993). The three-dimensional structure of ICE has been determined at atomic resolution by X-ray crystallography. Wilson, K. P., et al., \nNature, \n370, pp. 270-275 (1994). The active enzyme exists as a tetramer of two p20 and two p10 subunits.\n\n\nAdditionally, there exist human homologs of ICE with sequence similarities in the active site regions of the enzymes. Such homologs include TX (or ICE\nrel-II \nor ICH-2) (Faucheu, et al., \nEMBO J., \n14, p. 1914 (1995); Kamens J., et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n270, p. 15250 (1995); Nicholson et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n270 15870 (1995)), TY (or ICE\nrel-II\n) (Nicholson et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n270, p. 15870 (1995); ICH-1 (or Nedd-2) (Wang, L. et al., \nCell, \n78, p. 739 (1994)), MCH-2, (Fernandes-Alnemri, T. et al., \nCancer Res., \n55, p. 2737 (1995), CPP32 (or YAMA or apopain) (Fernandes-Alnemri, T. et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n269, p. 30761 (1994); Nicholson, D. W. et al., \nNature, \n376, p. 37 (1995)), and CMH-1 (or MCH-3) (Lippke, et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n(1996); Fernandes-Alnemri, T. et al., \nCancer Res., \n(1995)). Each of these ICE homologs, as well as ICE itself, is capable of inducing apoptosis when overexpressed in transfected cell lines. Inhibition of one or more of these homologs with the peptidyl ICE inhibitor Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone (SEQ ID NO: 1) results in inhibition of apoptosis in primary cells or cell lines. Lazebnik et al., \nNature, \n371, p. 346 (1994). The compounds described herein are also capable of inhibiting one or more homologs of ICE (see Example 5). Therefore, these compounds may be used to inhibit apoptosis in tissue types that contain ICE homologs, but which do not contain active ICE or produce mature IL-1β.\n\n\nInterferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) is an approximately 18-kDa polypeptide that stimulates T-cell production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). IGIF is produced by activated Kupffer cells and macrophages in vivo and is exported out of such cells upon endotoxin stimulation. Thus, a compound that decreases IGIF production would be useful as an inhibitor of such T-cell stimulation which in turn would reduce the levels of IFN-γ production by those cells.\n\n\nIFN-γ is a cytokine with immunomodulatory effects on a variety of immune cells. In particular, IFN-γ is involved in macrophage activation and Th1 cell selection (F. Belardelli, \nAPMIS, \n103, p. 161 (1995)). IFN-γ exerts its effects in part by modulating the expression of genes through the STAT and IRF pathways (C. Schindler and J. E. Darnell, \nAnn. Rev. Biochem., \n64, p. 621 (1995); T. Taniguchi, \nJ. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol., \n121, p. 516 (1995)).\n\n\nMice lacking IFN-γ or its receptor have multiple defects in immune cell function and are resistant to endotoxic shock (S. Huang et al., \nScience, \n259, p. 1742 (1993); D. Dalton et al., \nScience, \n259, p. 1739 (1993); B. D. Car et al., \nJ. Exp. Med., \n179, p. 1437 (1994)). Along with IL-12, IGIF appears to be a potent inducer of IFN-γ production by T cells (H. Okamura et al., \nInfection and Immunity, \n63, p. 3966 (1995); H. Okamura et al., \nNature, \n378, p. 88 (1995); S. Ushio et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n156, p. 4274 (1996)).\n\n\nIFN-γ has been shown to contribute to the pathology associated with a variety of inflammatory, infectious and autoimmune disorders and diseases. Thus, compounds capable of decreasing IFN-γ production would be useful to ameliorate the effects of IFN-γ related pathologies.\n\n\nThe biological regulation of IGIF and thus IFN-γ has not been elucidated. It is known that IGIF is synthesized as a precursor protein, called “pro-IGIF”. It has been unclear, however, how pro-IGIF is cleaved and whether its processing has biological importance.\n\n\nAccordingly, compositions and methods capable of regulating the conversion of pro-IGIF to IGIF would be useful for decreasing IGIF and IFN-γ production in vivo, and thus for ameliorating the detrimental effects of these proteins which contribute to human disorders and diseases.\n\n\nHowever, ICE and other members of the ICE/CED-3 family have not previously been linked to the conversion of pro-IGIF to IGIF or to IFN-γ production in vivo.\n\n\nICE inhibitors represent a class of compounds useful for the control of inflammation or apoptosis or both. Peptide and peptidyl inhibitors of ICE have been described. PCT patent applications WO 91/15577; WO 93/05071; WO 93/09135; WO 93/14777 and WO 93/16710; and \nEuropean patent application\n 0 547 699. Such peptidyl inhibitors of ICE has been observed to block the production of mature IL-1β in a mouse model of inflammation (vide infra) and to suppress growth of leukemia cells in vitro (Estrov et al., \nBlood \n84, 380a (1994)). However, due to their peptidic nature, such inhibitors are typically characterized by undesirable pharmacologic properties, such as poor cellular penetration and cellular activity, poor oral absorption, poor stability and rapid metabolism. Plattner, J. J. and D. W. Norbeck, in \nDrug Discovery Technologies\n, C. R. Clark and W. H. Moos, Eds. (Ellis Horwood, Chichester, England, 1990), pp. 92-126. This has hampered their development into effective drugs.\n\n\nNon-peptidyl compounds have also been reported to inhibit ICE in vitro. PCT patent application WO 95/26958; U.S. Pat. No. 5,552,400; Dolle et al., \nJ. Med. Chem., \n39, pp. 2438-2440 (1996); However, it is not clear whether these compounds have the appropriate pharmacological profile to be therapeutically useful.\n\n\nAdditionally, current methods for the preparation of such compounds are not advantageous. These methods use tributyltin hydride, a toxic, moisture sensitive reagent. Thus, these methods are inconvenient to carry out, pose a health risk and create toxic-waste disposal problems. Furthermore, it is difficult to purify compounds prepared by these methods.\n\n\nAccordingly, the need exists for compounds that can effectively inhibit the action of ICE in vivo, for use as agents for preventing and treating chronic and acute forms of IL-1-mediated diseases, apoptosis-, IGIF-, or IFN-γ-mediated diseases, as well as inflammatory, autoimmune, destructive bone, proliferative, infectious, or degenerative diseases. The need also exists for methods of preparing such compounds.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides novel classes of compounds, and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, that are useful as inhibitors of ICE. These compounds can be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic or prophylactic agents, such as antibiotics, immunomodulators or other anti-inflammatory agents, for the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases mediated by IL-1, apoptosis, IGIF or IFN-γ. According to a preferred embodiment, the compounds of this invention are capable of binding to the active site of ICE and inhibiting the activity of that enzyme. Additionally, they have improved cellular potency, improved pharmacokinetics, and/or improved oral bioavailability compared to peptidyl ICE inhibitors.\n\n\nIt is a principal object of this invention to provide novel classes of compounds which are inhibitors of ICE represented by formulas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein the various substituents are described herein.\n\n\nIt is a further object of this invention to provide a process of preparing N-acylamino compounds by coupling a carboxylic acid with an alloc-protected amine.\n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \nFIG. 1A\n ICE cleaves pro-IGIF in vivo. Cell lysates from Cos cells transfected with the various indicated expression plasmids or controls were analyzed for the presence of IGIF by separating proteins by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-IGIF antisera (\nlane\n 1, mock transfected cells; \nlane\n 2, pro-IGIF alone; lanes 3-12, pro-IGIF in combination with ICE, ICE-C285S, CPP32, CPP32-C163S, CMH-1, CMH-1-C186S, Tx, Tx-C258S, respectively). Mobilities of pro-IGIF and the 18-kDa mature IGIF are indicated on the right. Molecular weight markers in kDa are shown on the left (Example 23).\n\n\n \nFIG. 1B\n ICE cleaves pro-IGIF at the authentic processing site in vitro as shown by Coomassie blue staining of proteolytic reaction products separated by SDS-PAGE (Example 23). The proteases and inhibitors used were: \nlane\n 1, buffer control; \nlane\n 2, 0.1 nM ICE; \n \nlane\n \n 3, 1 nM ICE; \n \n \nlanes\n \n \n 4 and 5, 1 nM ICE with 10 nM Cbz-Val-Ala-Asp-[(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)oxy]methyl ketone and 100 nM Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde (SEQ ID NO: 2), respectively; \n \n \nlanes\n \n \n 6 and 7, 15 nM CPP32 with and without 400 nM Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (SEQ ID NO: 3) (D. W. Nicholson et al., \nNature, \n376, p. 37 (1995)), respectively; \n \nlane\n \n 8, 100 nM CMH-1; \n \nlane\n \n 9, 10 units/ml granzyme B; and M, molecular weight markers in kDa.\n\n\n \nFIG. 1C\n ICE cleavage converts inactive pro-IGIF to active IGIF which induces IFN-γ production in Th1 helper cells. Uncleaved (Pro-IGIF), ICE-cleaved (Pro-IGIF/ICE), CPP32-cleaved (Pro-IGIF/CPP32), and recombinant mature IGIF (rIGIF) were incubated with A.E7 Th1 cells at 12 ng/ml (open bar) and 120 ng/ml (hatched bar) for eighteen hours and the levels of IFN-γ released into the culture medium assayed by ELISA (Example 23). A.E7 cells cultured with buffer, ICE alone (ICE) or CPP32 alone (CPP32) were assayed similarly for negative controls. The numbers represent the average of three determinations.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2A\n Mature IGIF (18-kDa) is produced by Cos cells co-transfected with pro-IGIF and ICE-expressing plasmids. Cell lysates (left) and conditioned medium (right) from Cos cells transfected with a pro-IGIF expression plasmid in the absence (−) or presence of an expression plasmid encoding wild type (ICE) or inactive mutant (ICE-C285S) ICE. Transfected cells were metabolically labeled with \n35\nS-methionine, proteins from cell lysates and conditioned medium immunoprecipitated with anti-IGIF antisera and separated by SDS-PAGE (Example 24). Mobilities of pro-IGIF and the 18-kDa mature IGIF are indicated on the right. Molecular weight markers in kDa are shown on the left.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2B\n IFN-γ inducing activity is detected in Cos cells co-transfected with pro-IGIF and ICE-expressing plasmids. Cell lysates (hatched bar) and conditioned medium (open bar) from Cos cells transfected with a pro-IGIF expression plasmid in the absence (Pro-IGIF) or presence (Pro-IGIF/ICE) of an expression plasmid encoding wild type (ICE) were assayed for IFN-γ levels (ng/ml) by ELISA. Cos cells transfected with buffer (Mock) or an ICE-expressing plasmid alone (ICE) served as negative controls (Example 24).\n\n\n \nFIG. 3A\n Kupffer cells from mice lacking ICE are defective in the export of IGIF. Kupffer cells from wild type mice (ICE+/+) or ICE-deficient mice homozygous for an ICE mutation (ICE−/−) were isolated and primed with LPS for three hours. The levels of immunoreactive IGIF polypeptides in the conditioned media (ng/ml) of wild type cells were measured by ELISA (Example 25). N.D. (not detectable) indicates that the IGIF concentration was less than 0.1 ng/ml.\n\n\n \nFIG. 3B\n Kupffer cells from mice lacking ICE are defective in the export of mature IGIF. Kupffer cells from wild type mice (ICE+/+) or ICE deficient mice homozygous for an ICE mutation (ICE−/−) were isolated and primed with LPS for three hours. Primed cells were metabolically labeled with \n35\nS-methionine, proteins from cell lysates and conditioned medium immunoprecipitated with anti-IGIF antisera and separated by SDS-PAGE (Example 25). Mobilities of pro-IGIF and the 18-kDa mature IGIF are indicated on the right. Molecular mass markers in kDa are shown on the left.\n\n\n \nFIG. 3C\n Serum from ICE-deficient mice contains reduced levels of IGIF. Serum samples from wild type mice (ICE+/+) or ICE deficient mice homozygous for an ICE mutation (ICE−/−) were assayed for IGIF levels (ng/ml) by ELISA (Example 25).\n\n\n \nFIG. 3D\n Serum from ICE-deficient mice contains reduced levels of IFN-γ. Serum samples from wild type mice (ICE+/+) or ICE deficient mice homozygous for an ICE mutation (ICE−/−) were assayed for IFN-γ levels (ng/ml) by ELISA (Example 25).\n\n\n \nFIG. 4\n Serum IFN-γ levels are significantly reduced in ICE-deficient mice after an acute challenge with LPS (Example 26). Serum samples from wild type mice (filled squares) or ICE-deficient mice (filled circles) were assayed for IFN-γ levels (ng/ml) by ELISA as a function of time (hours) after LPS challenge. Temperatures of the animals during the time course in degrees Celcius is shown for wild type mice (open squares) or ICE-deficient mice (open circles).\n\n\n \nFIG. 5\n The ICE inhibitor, AcYVAD-aldehyde (AcYVAD-CHO, SEQ ID NO: 2), inhibits LPS-stimulated IL-18 and IFN-γ synthesis by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Percent (%) inhibition as a function of inhibitor concentration (μM) is shown for IL-1β (open squares) and IFN-γ (open diamonds) synthesis.\n\n\n \nFIG. 6\n \nCompound\n 214e inhibits IL-1β production in LPS-challenged mice. Serum samples from CD1 mice were assayed for IL-1β levels (pg/ml) by ELISA after LPS challenge. \nCompound\n 214e was administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection one hour after LPS challenge. Blood was collected seven hours after LPS challenge (see Example 7).\n\n\n \nFIG. 7\n \nCompound\n 217e inhibits IL-1β production in LPS-challenged mice. Serum samples from CD1 mice were assayed for IL-1β levels (pg/ml) by ELISA after LPS challenge. \nCompound\n 217e was administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection one hour after LPS challenge. Blood was collected seven hours after LPS challenge (see Example 7).\n\n\n \nFIG. 8\n \nCompound\n 214e, but not compound 217e, inhibits IL-1β production in LPS-challenged mice when administered by oral gavage. This assay measures oral absorption under similar conditions as those described for \nFIGS. 6 and 7\n. These results indicates that 214e is potentially orally active as an ICE inhibitor (see Example 7).\n\n\n \nFIG. 9\n \nCompound\n 214e and analogs of 214e also inhibit IL-1β production after IP administration. These results were obtained in the assay described for \nFIGS. 6 and 7\n and Example 7.\n\n\n \nFIG. 10\n \nCompound\n 214e, and analogs of 214e, also inhibit IL-1β production after oral (PO) administration. These results were obtained in the assay described for \nFIGS. 6 and 7\n and Example 7.\n\n\n \nFIG. 11\n \nCompounds\n 302 and 304a show detectable blood levels when administered orally (50 mg/kg, in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose) to mice. Blood samples were collected at 1 and 7 hours after dosing. \nCompounds\n 302 and 304a are prodrugs of 214e and are metabolized to 214e in vivo. \nCompound\n 214e shows no blood levels above 0.10 μg/ml when administered orally (Example 8).\n\n\n \nFIG. 12\n Compound 412f blocks the progression of type II collagen-induced arthritis in male DBA/1J mice (Wooley, P. H., \nMethods in Enzymology, \n162, pp. 361-373 (1988) and Geiger, T., \nClinical and Experimental Rheumatology, \n11, pp. 515-522 (1993)). Compound 412f was administered twice a day (10, 25 and 50 mg/kg), approximately 7 h apart, by oral gavage. Inflammation was measured on the Arthritis Severity Score on a 1 to 4 scale of increasing severity. The scores of the two front paws were added to give the final score (see Example 21).\n\n\n \nFIG. 13\n Compound 412d blocks the progression of type II collagen-induced arthritis in male DBA/1J mice. The results were obtained as described for \nFIG. 12\n and in Example 21.\n\n\n \nFIG. 14\n Compound 696a blocks the progression of type II collagen-induced arthritis in male DBA/1J mice. The results were obtained as described for \nFIG. 12\n and in Example 21.\n\n\n\n\nABBREVIATIONS AND DEFINITIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDesignation\n\n\nReagent or Fragment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla\n\n\nalanine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArg\n\n\narginine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsn\n\n\nasparagine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsp\n\n\naspartic acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys\n\n\ncysteine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln\n\n\nglutamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlu\n\n\nglutamic acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly\n\n\nglycine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis\n\n\nhistidine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle\n\n\nisoleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeu\n\n\nleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLys\n\n\nlysine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet\n\n\nmethionine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe\n\n\nphenylalanine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro\n\n\nproline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer\n\n\nserine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr\n\n\nthreonine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrp\n\n\ntryptophan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr\n\n\ntyrosine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal\n\n\nvaline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAc\n2\nO\n\n\nacetic anhydride\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nn-Bu\n\n\nnormal-butyl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDMF\n\n\ndimethylformamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDIEA\n\n\nN,N-diisopropylethylamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEDC\n\n\n1-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-3-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEt\n2\nO\n\n\ndiethyl ether\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEtOAC\n\n\nethyl acetate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFmoc\n\n\n9-fluorenylmethyoxycarbonyl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHBTU\n\n\nO-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ntetramethyluronium\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nhexafluorophosphate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHOBT\n\n\n1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMeOH\n\n\nmethanol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTFA\n\n\ntrifluoroacetic acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAlloc\n\n\nallyloxycarbonyl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nThe following terms are employed herein:\n\n\nThe term “interferon gamma inducing factor” or “IGIF” refers to a factor which is capable of stimulating the endogenous production of IFN-γ.\n\n\nThe term “ICE inhibitor” refers to a compound which is capable of inhibiting the ICE enzyme. ICE inhibition may be determined using the methods described and incorporated by reference herein. The skilled practitioner realizes that an in vivo ICE inhibitor is not necessarily an in vitro ICE inhibitor. For example, a prodrug form of a compound typically demonstrates little or no activity in in vitro assays. Such prodrug forms may be altered by metabolic or other biochemical processes in the patient to provide an vivo ICE inhibitor.\n\n\nThe term “cytokine” refers to a molecule which mediates interactions between cells.\n\n\nThe term “condition” refers to any disease, disorder or effect that produces deleterious biological consequences in a subject.\n\n\nThe term “subject” refers to an animal, or to one or more cells derived from an animal.

Each heterocycle consists of carbon atoms and from one to four heteroatoms independently selected from a group including nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. As used herein, the terms “nitrogen heteroatoms” and “sulphur heteroatoms” include any oxidized form of nitrogen or sulfur and the quaternized form of any basic nitrogen. Heterocycles defined above include, for example, pyrimidinyl, tetrahydroquinolyl, tetrahydroisoquinonlinyl, purinyl, pyrimidyl, indolinyl, benzimidazolyl, imidazolyl, imidazolinoyl, imidazolidinyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, indolyl, pyridyl, pyrrolyl, pyrrolinyl, pyrazolyl, pyrazinyl, quinoxolyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, thiamorpholinyl, furyl, thienyl, triazolyl, thiazolyl, β-carbolinyl, tetrazolyl, thiazolidinyl, benzofuranoyl, thiamorpholinyl sulfone, benzoxazolyl, oxopiperidinyl, oxopyrroldinyl, oxoazepinyl, azepinyl, isoxazolyl, tetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, thiadiazolyl, benzodioxolyl, benzothienyl, tetrahydrothiophenyl and sulfolanyl. Further heterocycles are described in A. R. Katritzky and C. W. Rees, eds., \nComprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry The Structure. Reactions. Synthesis and Use of Heterocyclic Compounds\n, Vol. 1-8, Pergamon Press, NY (1984).\n\n\nThe term “cycloalkyl” refers to a mono- or polycyclic group which contains 3 to 15 carbons and may optionally contain one or two double bonds. Examples include cyclohexyl, adamantyl and norbornyl.\n\n\nThe term “aryl” refers to a mono- or polycyclic group which contains 6, 10, 12, or 14 carbons in which at least one ring is aromatic. Examples include phenyl, naphthyl, and tetrahydronaphthalene.\n\n\nThe term “heteroaromatic” refers to a mono- or polycyclic group which contains 1 to 15 carbon atoms and from 1 to 4 heteroatoms, each of which is selected independently from a group including sulphur, nitrogen and oxygen, and which additionally contains from 1 to 3 five or six membered rings, at least one of which is aromatic.\n\n\nThe term “alpha-amino acid” (α-amino acid) refers to both the naturally occurring amino acids and other “non-protein” α-amino acids commonly utilized by those in the peptide chemistry arts when preparing synthetic analogues of naturally occurring peptides, including D and L forms. The naturally occurring amino acids are glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, iso-leucine, serine, methionine, threonine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, cysteine, proline, histidine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, glutamine, γ-carboxyglutamic acid, arginine, ornithine and lysine. Examples of “non-protein” alpha-amino acids include hydroxylysine, homoserine, homotyrosine, homo-phenylalanine, citrulline, kynurenine, 4-amino-phenylalanine, 3-(2-naphthyl)-alanine, 3-(1-naphthyl)-alanine, methionine sulfone, t-butyl-alanine, t-butylglycine, 4-hydroxyphenylglycine, aminoalanine, phenylglycine, vinylalanine, propargyl-glycine, 1,2,4-triazolo-3-alanine, 4,4,4-trifluoro-threonine, thyronine, 6-hydroxytryptophan, 5-hydro-xytryptophan, 3-hydroxykynurenine, 3-aminotyrosine, trifluoromethyl-alanine, 2-thienylalanine, (2-(4-pyridyl)ethyl)-cysteine, 3,4-dimethoxy-phenylalanine, 3-(2-thiazolyl)-alanine, ibotenic acid, 1-amino-1-cyclopentane-carboxylic acid, 1-amino-1-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, quisqualic acid, 3-trifluoromethylphenylalanine, 4-trifluoro-methylphenylalanine, cyclohexylalanine, cyclo-hexylglycine, thiohistidine, 3-methoxytyrosine, elastatinal, norleucine, norvaline, alloisoleucine, homoarginine, thioproline, dehydroproline, hydroxy-proline, isonipectotic acid, homoproline, cyclohexyl-glycine, α-amino-n-butyric acid, cyclohexylalanine, aminophenylbutyric acid, phenylalanines substituted at the ortho, meta, or para position of the phenyl moiety with one or two of the following: a (C\n1\n-C\n4\n) alkyl, a (C\n1\n-C\n4\n) alkoxy, halogen or nitro groups or substituted with a methylenedioxy group; β-2- and 3-thienyl-alanine, β-2- and 3-furanylalanine, β-2-, 3- and 4-pyridylalanine, β-(benzothienyl-2- and 3-yl)alanine, β-(1- and 2-naphthyl)alanine, O-alkylated derivatives of serine, threonine or tyrosine, S-alkylated cysteine, S-alkylated homocysteine, O-sulfate, O-phosphate and O-carboxylate esters of tyrosine, 3-sulfo-tyrosine, 3-carboxy-tyrosine, 3-phospho-tyrosine, 4-methane sulfonic acid ester of tyrosine, 4-methane phosphonic acid ester of tyrosine, 3,5-diiodotyrosine, 3-nitro-tyrosine, ε-alkyl lysine, and delta-alkyl ornithine. Any of these α-amino acids may be substituted with a methyl group at the alpha position, a halogen at any aromatic residue on the α-amino side chain, or an appropriate protective group at the O, N, or S atoms of the side chain residues. Appropriate protective groups are disclosed in “Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis,” T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, J. Wiley & Sons, NY, N.Y., 1991.\n\n\nThe term “substitute” refers to the replacement of a hydrogen atom in a compound with a substituent group. In the present invention, those hydrogen atoms which form a part of a hydrogen bonding moiety which is capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Arg-341 of ICE or the carbonyl oxygen of Ser-339 of ICE are excluded from substitution. These excluded hydrogen atoms include those which comprise an —NH— group which is alpha to a —CO— group and are depicted as —NH— rather than an X group or some other designation in the following diagrams: (a) through (t), (v) through (z).\n\n\nThe term “straight chain” refers to a contiguous unbranching string of covalently bound atoms. The straight chain may be substituted, but these substituents are not a part of the straight chain.\n\n\nThe term “K\ni\n” refers to a numerical measure of the effectiveness of a compound in inhibiting the activity of a target enzyme such as ICE. Lower values of K\ni \nreflect higher effectiveness. The K\ni \nvalue is a derived by fitting experimentally determined rate data to standard enzyme kinetic equations (see I. H. Segel, \nEnzyme Kinetics\n, Wiley-Interscience, 1975).\n\n\nThe term “patient” as used in this application refers to any mammal, especially humans.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutically effective amount” refers to an amount effective in treating or ameliorating an IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF- or IFN-γ-mediated disease in a patient. The term “prophylactically effective amount” refers to an amount effective in preventing or substantially lessening IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF or IFN-γ mediated diseases in a patient.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or adjuvant” refers to a non-toxic carrier or adjuvant that may be administered to a patient, together with a compound of this invention, and which does not destroy the pharmacological activity thereof.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable derivative” means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or salt of such ester, of a compound of this invention or any other compound which, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of this invention or an anti-ICE active metabolite or residue thereof.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include, for example, those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of suitable acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, perchloric, fumaric, maleic, phosphoric, glycolic, lactic, salicylic, succinic, toluene-p-sulfonic, tartaric, acetic, citric, methanesulfonic, formic, benzoic, malonic, naphthalene-2-sulfonic and benzenesulfonic acids. Other acids, such as oxalic, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal (e.g., sodium), alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N—(C\n1-4 \nalkyl)\n4\n \n+\n salts.\n\n\nThis invention also envisions the “quaternization” of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds disclosed herein. The basic nitrogen can be quaternized with any agents known to those of ordinary skill in the art including, for example, lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl chloride, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates including dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; and aralkyl halides including benzyl and phenethyl bromides. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products may be obtained by such quaternization.\n\n\nThe ICE inhibitors of this invention may contain one or more “asymmetric” carbon atoms and thus may occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. All such isomeric forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. Each stereogenic carbon may be of the R or S configuration. Although specific compounds and scaffolds exemplified in this application may be depicted in a particular stereochemical configuration, compounds and scaffolds having either the opposite stereochemistry at any given chiral center or mixtures thereof are also envisioned.\n\n\nThe ICE inhibitors of this invention may comprise ring structures which may optionally be substituted at carbon, nitrogen or other atoms by various substituents. Such ring structures may be singly or multiply substituted. Preferably, the ring structures contain between 0 and 3 substituents. When multiply substituted, each substituent may be picked independently of any other substituent as long as the combination of substituents results in the formation of a stable compound.\n\n\nCombinations of substituents and variables envisioned by this invention are only those that result in the formation of stable compounds. The term “stable”, as used herein, refers to compounds which possess stability sufficient to allow manufacture and administration to a mammal by methods known in the art. Typically, such compounds are stable at a temperature of 40° C. or less, in the absence of moisture or other chemically reactive conditions, for at least a week.\n\n\nSubstituents may be represented in various forms. These various forms are known to the skilled practitioner and may be used interchangeably. For example, a methyl substituent on a phenyl ring may be represented in any of the following forms:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious forms of substituents such as methyl are used herein interchangeably.\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn order that the invention herein described may be more fully understood, the following detailed description is set

embodiments (K) and (L) are those wherein the Ar\n3 \ncyclic group is isoquinolyl.\n\n\nCompounds of this invention are described in co-pending U.S. application Ser. Nos. 08/575,641 and 08/598,332 the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention have a molecular weight of less than or equal to about 700 Daltons, and more preferably between about 400 and 600 Daltons. These preferred compounds may be readily absorbed by the bloodstream of patients upon oral administration. This oral availability makes such compounds excellent agents for orally-administered treatment and prevention regimens against IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF- or IFN-γ mediated diseases.\n\n\nIt should be understood that the compounds of this invention may exist in various equilibrium forms, depending on conditions including choice of solvent, pH, and others known to the practitioner skilled in the art. All such forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. In particular, many of the compounds of this invention, especially those which contain aldehyde or ketone groups in R\n3 \nand carboxylic acid groups in T, may take hemi-ketal (or hemi-acetal) or hydrated forms. For example, compounds of embodiment (A) may take the forms depicted below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the choice of solvent and other conditions known to the practitioner skilled in the art, compounds of this invention may also take acyloxy ketal, acyloxy acetal, ketal or acetal form:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, it should be understood that the equilibrium forms of the compounds of this invention may include tautomeric forms. All such forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention.\n\n\nIt should be understood that the compounds of this invention may be modified by appropriate functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in the art and include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion. In addition, the compounds may be altered to pro-drug form such that the desired compound is created in the body of the patient as the result of the action of metabolic or other biochemical processes on the pro-drug. Such pro-drug forms typically demonstrate little or no activity in in vitro assays. Some examples of pro-drug forms include ketal, acetal, oxime, imine, and hydrazone forms of compounds which contain ketone or aldehyde groups, especially where they occur in the R\n3 \ngroup of the compounds of this invention. Other examples of pro-drug forms include the hemi-ketal, hemi-acetal, acyloxy ketal, acyloxy acetal, ketal, and acetal forms that are described in EQ1 and EQ2.\n\n\nICE and TX Cleave and Thereby Activate Pro-IGIF\n\n\nThe ICE protease was identified previously by virtue of its ability to process inactive pro-IL-1β to mature active IL-1β, a pro-inflammatory molecule, in vitro and in vivo. Here we show that ICE and its close homologue TX (Caspase-4, C. Faucheu et al., \nEMBO, \n14, p. 1914 (1995)) can proteolytically cleave inactive pro-IGIF. This processing step is required to convert pro-IGIF to its active mature form, IGIF. Cleavage of pro-IGIF by ICE, and presumably by TX, also facilitates the export of IGIF out of cells.\n\n\nWe first used transient co-expression of plasmids transfected into Cos cells to determine whether any known members of the ICE/CED-3 protease family can process pro-IGIF to IGIF in cultured cells (Example 23) (\nFIG. 1A\n).\n\n\n \nFIG. 1A\n demonstrates that ICE cleaves pro-IGIF in Cos cells co-transfected with plasmids that express pro-IGIF in the presence of active ICE. Cos cells were transfected with an expression plasmid for pro-IGIF alone (lane 2) or in combination with the indicated expression plasmids encoding wild type or inactive mutants of ICE/CED-3 family of proteases (lanes 3-12). Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for the presence of IGIF protein by immunoblotting with an anti-IGIF antiserum. \nLane\n 1 contained lysates from mock transfected cells.\n\n\nCo-expression of pro-IGIF with ICE or TX resulted in the cleavage of pro-IGIF into a polypeptide similar in size to the naturally-occurring 18-kDa mature IGIF. This processing event is blocked by single point mutations that alter the catalytic cysteine residues and thus inactivate ICE and TX (Y. Gu et al., \nEMBO, \n14, p. 1923 (1995)).\n\n\nCo-expression with CPP32 (Caspase-3), a protease involved in programmed cell death (T. Fernandes-Alnemri et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n269, p. 30761 (1994); D. W. Nicholson et al., \nNature, \n376, p. 37 (1995)), resulted in the cleavage of pro-IGIF into a smaller polypeptide, while co-expression with CMH-1 (Caspase-7), a close homolog of CPP32 (J. A. Lippke et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n271, p. 1825 (1996)), failed to cleave pro-IGIF to any significant extent. Thus, ICE and TX appear to be capable of cleaving pro-IGIF into a polypeptide similar in size to the naturally-occurring 18-kDa IGIF.\n\n\nWe next examined the ability of these cysteine proteases to cleave pro-IGIF in vitro using a purified, recombinant (His)\n6\n-tagged pro-IGIF as a substrate (Example 23).\n\n\n \nFIG. 1B\n demonstrates that pro-IGIF is cleaved in vitro by ICE. Purified recombinant (His)\n6\n-tagged pro-IGIF (2 μg) was incubated with the indicated cysteine protease in the presence or absence of ICE or CPP32 inhibitors as described in Example 23. The cleavage products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.\n\n\nICE cleaved the 24 kDa pro-IGIF into two polypeptides of approximately 18-kDa and 6-kDa. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the ICE cleavage products indicated that the 18-kDa polypeptide contains the same N-terminal amino acid residues (Asn-Phe-Gly-Arg-Leu, SEQ ID NO: 4) as the naturally occurring IGIF. This shows that ICE cleaves pro-IGIF at the authentic processing site (Asp35-Asn36) (H. Okamura et al., Infection and Immunity, 63, p. 3966 (1995); H. Okamura et al., Nature, 378, p. 88 (1995)). N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the CPP32 cleavage products indicated that CPP32 cleaved pro-IGIF at Asp69-Ile70.\n\n\nThe cleavage by ICE of pro-IGIF is highly specific with a catalytic efficiency (k\ncat\n/K\nM\n) of 1.4×10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \n(K\nM\n=0.6±0.1 μM; k\ncat\n=8.6±0.3 s\n−1\n) and is inhibited by specific ICE inhibitors (Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde, SEQ ID NO: 2) and Cbz-Val-Ala-Asp-[(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)oxy]methylketone, (N. A. Thornberry et al., \nNature, \n356, p. 768 (1992); R. E. Dolle et al., \nJ. Med. Chem., \n37, p. 563 (1994)).\n\n\n \nFIG. 1C\n demonstrates that ICE cleavage in vitro activates pro-IGIF. Uncleaved pro-IGIF, ICE- or CPP32-cleaved products of pro-IGIF, or recombinant mature IGIF (rIGIF) were each added to A.E7 cell cultures to a final concentration of 12 ng/ml or 120 ng/ml (see, Example 23). Eighteen hours later, IFN-γ in the cultural medium was quantified by ELISA. While the uncleaved pro-IGIF had no detectable IFN-γ inducing activity, ICE-cleaved pro-IGIF was active in inducing IFN-γ production in Th1 cells.\n\n\nLike ICE, the ICE homolog TX also cleaved pro-IGIF into similarly sized polypeptides. However, its catalytic efficiency was about two orders of magnitude lower than that shown for ICE.\n\n\nConsistent with the observations from the Cos cell experiments above, CPP32 cleaved pro-IGIF at a different site (Asp69-Ile7O) and the resulting polypeptides had little IFN-γ inducing activity (\nFIG. 1C\n). CMH-1 and granzyme B each failed to cleave pro-IGIF to any significant extent.\n\n\nTogether, these results demonstrate that, both in Cos cells and in vitro, ICE and TX are capable of processing the inactive pro-IGIF precursor at the authentic maturation site to generate a biologically active IGIF molecule.\n\n\nProcessing of Pro-IGIF by ICE Facilitates Its Export\n\n\nIGIF is produced by activated Kupffer cells and macrophages in vivo and is exported out of the cells upon stimulation by endotoxin (H. Okamura et al., \nInfection and Immunity, \n63, p. 3966 (1995); H. Okamura et al., \nNature, \n378, p. 88 (1995). We used the Cos cell co-expression system (Example 23) to examine whether the intracellular cleavage of pro-IGIF by ICE would facilitate the export of mature IGIF from the cell. Such is the case for pro-IL-1β when it is cleaved by ICE into active IL-1β (N. A. Thornberry et al., \nNature, \n356, p. 768 (1992)).\n\n\nIn \nFIG. 2A\n, Cos cells transfected with an expression plasmid for pro-IGIF alone (\nlanes\n 2 and 6) or in combination with an expression plasmid encoding wild type (\nlanes\n 3 and 7) or inactive mutant ICE (\nlanes\n 4 and 8) were metabolically labeled with \n35\nS-methionine (see, Example 24). Cell lysates (left) and conditioned medium (right) were immunoprecipitated with an anti-IGIF antiserum. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (\nFIG. 2A\n).\n\n\nAn 18-kDa polypeptide corresponding in size to mature IGIF was detected in the conditioned medium of Cos cells co-expressing pro-IGIF and ICE, while Cos cells co-expressing pro-IGIF and an inactive ICE mutant (ICE-C285S), or pro-IGIF alone (−) exported only very low levels of pro-IGIF and no detectable mature IGIF. We estimate that about 10% of the mature IGIF was exported from co-transfected cells, while greater than 99% of pro-IGIF was retained within the cells.\n\n\nWe also measured the presence of IFN-γ inducing activity in cell lysates and in the conditioned medium of the above transfected cells (see, Example 24). IFN-γ inducing activity was detected in both cell lysates and the conditioned medium of Cos cells co-expressing pro-IGIF and ICE, but not in cells expressing either pro-IGIF or ICE alone (\nFIG. 2B\n).\n\n\nThese results indicate that ICE cleavage of pro-IGIF facilitates the export of mature, active IGIF from cells.\n\n\nPro-IGIF is a Physiological Substrate of ICE In Vivo\n\n\nTo study the role of ICE in the proteolytic activation and export of IGIF under physiological conditions, we examined the processing of pro-IGIF and export of mature IGIF from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated Kupffer cells harvested from \nPropiobacterium acnes\n-elicited wild type and ICE deficient (ICE−/−) mice (Example 25).\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 3A\n, Kupffer cells from ICE−/− mice are defective in the export of IGIF. Kupffer cell lysates of wild type and ICE−/− mice contained similar amounts of IGIF as determined by ELISA. IGIF, however, could be detected only in the conditioned medium of wild type but not of the ICE−/− cells. Thus, ICE-deficient (ICE−/−) mice synthesize pro-IGIF, but fail to export it as extracellular pro- or mature IGIF.\n\n\nTo determine whether ICE-deficient (ICE−/−) mice process intracellular pro-IGIF but fail to export IGIF, Kupffer cells from wild type and ICE−/− mice were metabolically labeled with \n35\nS-methionine and IGIF immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on cell lysates and conditioned media as described in Example 25. These experiments demonstrated that unprocessed pro-IGIF was present in both wild type and ICE−/− Kupffer cells. However, the 18-kDa mature IGIF was present only in the conditioned medium of wild type and not ICE−/− Kupffer cells (\nFIG. 3B\n). This shows that active ICE is required in cells for the export of processed IGIF out of the cell.\n\n\nIn addition, conditioned medium from wild type but not from ICE−/− Kupffer cells contained IFN-γ inducing activity that was not attributed to the action of IL-12 because it was insensitive to a neutralizing anti-IL-12 antibody. The absence of IGIF in the conditioned medium of ICE−/− Kupffer cells is consistent with the finding in Cos cells that the processing of pro-IGIF by ICE is required for the export of active IGIF.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 3C and 3D\n show that, in vivo, ICE−/− mice have reduced serum levels of IGIF and IFN-γ, respectively. Wild type (ICE+/+) and ICE−/− mice (n=3) primed with heat-inactivated \nP. acnes \nwere challenged with LPS (Example 26), and the levels of IGIF (\nFIG. 3C\n) and IFN-γ (\nFIG. 3D\n) in the sera of challenged mice were measured by ELISA three hours after LPS challenge (Example 25).\n\n\nThe sera of ICE−/− mice stimulated by \nP. acnes \nand LPS contained reduced levels of IGIF (\nFIG. 3C\n) and no detectable IFN-γ inducing activity in the presence of an anti-IL-12 antibody. The reduced serum levels of IGIF likely accounts for the significantly lower levels of IFN-γ in the sera of ICE−/− mice (\nFIG. 3D\n), because we have observed no significant difference in the production of IL-12 in ICE−/− mice under these conditions. Consistent with this interpretation is the finding that non-adherent splenocytes from wild type and ICE−/− mice produced similar amounts of IFN-γ when stimulated with recombinant active IGIF in vitro. Thus the impaired production of IFN-γ is not due to any apparent defect in the T cells of the ICE−/− mice.\n\n\nTaken together, these results establish a critical role for ICE in processing the IGIF precursor and in the export of active IGIF both in vitro and in vivo.\n\n\nTo examine in more detail the relationship between serum levels of IFN-γ and ICE activity in vivo, a time course after challenge of wild type and ICE-deficient mice with LPS was performed (Example 26) (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\n \nFIG. 4\n shows a time course increase of serum IFN-γ in wild type mice, with sustained levels of ≧17 ng/ml occurring from 9-18 hrs after LPS challenge. As predicted by the experiments discussed above, serum IFN-γ levels were significantly lower in ICE−/− mice, with a maximum of 2 ng/ml achieved over the same time period, which is approximately 15% of the level observed in wild type mice (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\nAnimals were also observed for clinical signs of sepsis and body temperature was measured at 4-hour intervals in wild type and ICE−/− mice challenged with 30 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg LPS (ICE−/− only). Results in \nFIG. 4\n show that wild type mice experienced a significant decrease in body temperature (from 36° C. to 26° C.) within 12 hours of LPS challenge. Signs of clinical sepsis were evident and all animals expired within 24-28 hours.\n\n\nIn contrast, ICE−/− mice challenged with 30 mg/kg LPS experienced only a 3°-4° C. decrease in body temperature with minimal signs of distress and with no observed lethality. ICE−/− mice challenged with 100 mg/kg LPS experienced clinical symptoms, a decrease in body temperature, and mortality similar to wild type mice at the 30 mg/kg LPS dose.\n\n\nThe ICE Inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO (SEQ ID NO: 2) is an Equipotent Inhibitor of IL-18 and IFN-γ Production.\n\n\nSince the processing and secretion of biologically active IGIF is mediated by ICE, we compared the activity of a reversible ICE inhibitor (Ac-YVAD-CHO, SEQ ID NO: 2) on IL-1β and IFN-γ production in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) assay (Examples 27).\n\n\nResults in \nFIG. 5\n show a similar potency for the ability of the Ac-YVAD-CHO (SEQ ID NO: 2) ICE inhibitor to decrease IL-Iβ and IFN-γ production in human PBMCs, with an IC\n50 \nof 2.5 μM for each. Similar results were obtained in studies with wild type mouse splenocytes.\n\n\nThese findings provide additional evidence that pro-IGIF is a physiological substrate for ICE and suggest that ICE inhibitors will be useful tools for controlling physiological levels of IGIF and IFN-γ.\n\n\nIn summary, we have found that ICE controls IGIF and IFN-γ levels in vivo and in vitro and that ICE inhibitors can decrease levels of IGIF and IFN-γ in human cells. These results have been described in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/712,878, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nCompositions and Methods\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions and methods of this invention will be useful for controlling IL-1, IGIF and IFN-γ levels in vivo. The methods and compositions of this invention will thus be useful for treating or reducing the advancement, severity of effects of IL-1, IGIF- and IFN-γ-mediated conditions.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention are effective ligands for ICE. Accordingly, these compounds are capable of targeting and inhibiting events in IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF-, and IFN-γ-mediated diseases, and, thus, the ultimate activity of that protein in inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, destructive bone, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases, and degenerative diseases. For example, the compounds of this invention inhibit the conversion of precursor IL-1β to mature IL-1β by inhibiting ICE. Because ICE is essential for the production of mature IL-1, inhibition of that enzyme effectively blocks initiation of IL-1-mediated physiological effects and symptoms, such as inflammation, by inhibiting the production of mature IL-1. Thus, by inhibiting IL-1β precursor activity, the compounds of this invention effectively function as IL-1 inhibitors.\n\n\nSimilarly, compounds of this invention inhibit the conversion of precursor IGIF to mature IGIF. Thus, by inhibiting IGIF production, the compounds of this invention effectively function as inhibitors of IFN-γ production.\n\n\nAccordingly, one embodiment of this invention provides a method for decreasing IGIF production in a subject comprising the step of administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an ICE inhibitor and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of this invention provides a method for decreasing IFN-γ production in a subject comprising the step of administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an ICE inhibitor and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the methods of this invention comprise the step of administering to a subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising an inhibitor of an ICE-related protease that is capable of cleaving pro-IGIF to active IGIF, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. One such ICE-related protease is TX, as described above. This invention thus provides methods and pharmaceutical compositions for controlling IGIF and IFN-γ levels by administering a TX inhibitor.\n\n\nOther ICE-related proteases capable of processing pro-IGIF into an active IGIF form may also be found. Thus it is envisioned that inhibitors of those enzymes may be identified by those of skill in the art and will also fall within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention may be employed in a conventional manner for the treatment of diseases which are mediated by IL-1, apoptosis, IGIF or IFN-γ. Such methods of treatment, their dosage levels and requirements may be selected by those of ordinary skill in the art from available methods and techniques. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant for administration to a patient suffering from an IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF- or IFN-γ-mediated disease in a pharmaceutically acceptable manner and in an amount effective to lessen the severity of that disease.\n\n\nAlternatively, the compounds of this invention may be used in compositions and methods for treating or protecting individuals against IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF- or IFN-γ-mediated diseases over extended periods of time. The compounds may be employed in such compositions either alone or together with other compounds of this invention in a manner consistent with the conventional utilization of ICE inhibitors in pharmaceutical compositions. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants conventionally employed in vaccines and administered in prophylactically effective amounts to protect individuals over an extended period of time against IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF- or IFN-γ-mediated diseases.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention may also be co-administered with other ICE inhibitors to increase the effect of therapy or prophylaxis against various IL-1-, apoptosis, IGIF- or IFN-γ-mediated diseases.\n\n\nIn addition, the compounds of this invention may be used in combination either conventional anti-inflammatory agents or with matrix metalloprotease inhibitors, lipoxygenase inhibitors and antagonists of cytokines other than IL-1β.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention can also be administered in combination with immunomodulators (e.g., bropirimine, anti-human alpha interferon antibody, IL-2, GM-CSF, methionine enkephalin, interferon alpha, diethyldithiocarbamate, tumor necrosis factor, naltrexone and rEPO) or with prostaglandins, to prevent or combat IL-1-mediated disease symptoms such as inflammation.\n\n\nWhen the compounds of this invention are administered in combination therapies with other agents, they may be administered sequentially or concurrently to the patient. Alternatively, pharmaceutical or prophylactic compositions according to this invention comprise a combination of an ICE inhibitor of this invention and another therapeutic or prophylactic agent.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions of this invention comprise any of the compounds of the present invention, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, with any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or vehicle. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) such as da-tocopherol polyethyleneglycol 1000 succinate, or other similar polymeric delivery matrices, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol and wool fat. Cyclodextrins such as α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrin, or chemically modified derivatives such as hydroxyalkylcyclodextrins, including 2- and 3-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrines, or other solubilized derivatives may also be advantageously used to enhanve delivery of compounds of this invention.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. We prefer oral administration. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may contain any conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles. In some cases, the pH of the formulation may be adjusted with pharmaceutically acceptable acids, bases or buffers to enhance the stability of the formulated compounds or its delivery form. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example, as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents (such as, for example, Tween 80) and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are mannitol, water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant such as \nPh. Helv \nor a similar alcohol.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, and aqueous suspensions and solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions are administered orally, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and/or flavoring and/or coloring agents may be added.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These compositions can be prepared by mixing a compound of this invention with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at the rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the active components. Such materials include, but are not limited to, cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\nTopical administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention is especially useful when the desired treatment involves areas or organs readily accessible by topical application. For application topically to the skin, the pharmaceutical composition should be formulated with a suitable ointment containing the active components suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petroleum, white petroleum, propylene glycol, polyoxy-ethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition can be formulated with a suitable lotion or cream containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, \npolysorbate\n 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be topically applied to the lower intestinal tract by rectal suppository formulation or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-administered transdermal patches are also included in this invention.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation.

These examples are for the purpose of illustration only and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nInhibition of ICE\n\n\nWe obtained inhibition constants (K\ni\n) and IC\n50 \nvalues for compounds of this invention using the three methods described below:\n\n\n1. Enzyme Assay with UV-Visible Substrate\n\n\nThis assay is run using an Succinyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-pNitroanilide (SEQ ID NO: 5) substrate. Synthesis of analogous substrates is described by L. A. Reiter (Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 43, 87-96 (1994)). The assay mixture contains:\n\n\n65 μl buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% CHAPS @pH 8.1)\n\n\n10 μl ICE (50 nM final concentration to give a rate of ˜1 mOD/min)\n\n\n5 μl DMSO/lnhibitor mixture\n\n\n20 \nμl\n 400 μM Substrate (80 μM final concentration)\n\n\n100 μl total reaction volume\n\n\nThe visible ICE assay is run in a 96-well microtiter plate. Buffer, ICE and DMSO (if inhibitor is present) are added to the wells in the order listed. The components are left to incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes starting at the time that all components are present in all wells. The microtiter plate reader is set to incubate at 37° C. After the 15 minute incubation, substrate is added directly to the wells and the reaction is monitored by following the release of the chromophore (pNA) at 405-603 nm at 37° C. for 20 minutes. A linear fit of the data is performed and the rate is calculated in mOD/min. DMSO is only present during experiments involving inhibitors, buffer is used to make up the volume to 100 μl in the other experiments.\n\n\n2. Enzyme Assay with Fluorescent Substrate\n\n\nThis assay is run essentially according to Thornberry et al. (Nature 356: 768-774 (1992)), using substrate 17 referenced in that article. The substrate is: Acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) (SEQ ID NO: 6). The following components are mixed:\n\n\n65 μl buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% CHAPS @pH8.1)\n\n\n10 μl ICE (2-10 nM final concentration)\n\n\n5 μl DMSO/inhibitor solution\n\n\n20 \nμl\n 150 μM Substrate (30 μM final)\n\n\n100 μl total reaction volume\n\n\nThe assay is run in a 96 well microtiter plate. Buffer and ICE are added to the wells. The components are left to incubate at 37° C. for 15 minutes in a temperature-controlled wellplate. After the 15 minute incubation, the reaction is started by adding substrate directly to the wells and the reaction is monitored @37° C. for 30 minutes by following the release of the AMC fluorophore using an excitation wavelength for 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. A linear fit of the data for each well is performed and a rate is determined in fluorescence units per second.\n\n\nFor determination of enzyme inhibition constants (K\ni\n) or the mode of inhibition (competitive, uncompetitive or noncompetitive), the rate data determined in the enzyme assays at varying inhibitor concentrations are computer-fit to standard enzyme kinetic equations (see I. H. Segel, \nEnzyme Kinetics\n, Wiley-Interscience, 1975).\n\n\nThe determination of second order rate constants for irreversible inhibitors was performed by fitting the fluorescence vs time data to the progress equations of Morrison. Morrison, J. F., \nMol. Cell. Biophys., \n2, pp. 347-368 (1985). Thornberry et al. have published a description of these methods for measurement of rate constants of irreversible inhibitors of ICE. Thornberry, N. A., et al. \nBiochemistry, \n33, pp. 3923-3940 (1994). For compounds where no prior complex formation can be observed kinetically, the second order rate constants (k\ninact\n) are derived directly from the slope of the linear plots of k\nobs \nvs. [I]. For compounds where prior complex formation to the enzyme can be detected, the hyperbolic plots of k\nobs \nvs. [I] are fit to the equation for saturation kinetics to first generate K\ni \nand k′. The second order rate constant k\ninact \nis then given by k′/K\ni\n.\n\n\n3. PBMC Cell Assay\n\n\nIL-1β Assay with a Mixed Population of Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) or Enriched Adherent Mononuclear Cells\n\n\nProcessing of pre-IL-1β by ICE can be measured in cell culture using a variety of cell sources. Human PBMC obtained from healthy donors provides a mixed population of lymphocyte subtypes and mononuclear cells that produce a spectrum of interleukins and cytokines in response to many classes of physiological stimulators. Adherent mononuclear cells from PBMC provides an enriched source of normal monocytes for selective studies of cytokine production by activated cells.\n\n\nExperimental Procedure:\n\n\nAn initial dilution series of test compound in DMSO or ethanol is prepared, with a subsequent dilution into RPMI-10% FBS media (containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 50 U and 50 ug/ml pen/strep) respectively to yield drugs at 4× the final test concentration containing 0.4% DMSO or 0.4% ethanol. The final concentration of DMSO is 0.1% for all drug dilutions. A concentration titration which brackets the apparent K\ni \nfor a test compound determined in an ICE inhibition assay is generally used for the primary compound screen.\n\n\nGenerally 5-6 compound dilutions are tested and the cellular component of the assay is performed in duplicate, with duplicate ELISA determinations on each cell culture supernatant.\n\n\nPBMC Isolation and IL-1 Assay:\n\n\nBuffy coat cells isolated from one pint human blood (yielding 40-45 ml final volume plasma plus cells) are diluted with media to 80 ml and LeukoPREP separation tubes (Becton Dickinson) are each overlaid with 10 ml of cell suspension. After 15 min centrifugation at 1500-1800×g, the plasma/media layer is aspirated and then the mononuclear cell layer is collected with a Pasteur pipette and transferred to a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube (Corning). Media is added to bring the volume to 15 ml, gently mix the cells by inversion and centrifuge at 300×g for 15 min. Resuspend the PBMC pellet in a small volume of media, count cells and adjust to 6×10\n6 \ncells/ml.\n\n\nFor the cellular assay, 1.0 ml of the cell suspension is added to each well of a 24-well flat bottom tissue culture plate (Corning), 0.5 ml test compound dilution and 0.5 ml LPS solution (Sigma #L-3012; 20 ng/ml solution prepared in complete RPMI media; \nfinal LPS concentration\n 5 ng/ml). The 0.5 ml additions of test compound and LPS are usually sufficient to mix the contents of the wells. Three control mixtures are run per experiment, with either LPS alone, solvent vehicle control, and/or additional media to adjust the final culture volume to 2.0 ml. The cell cultures are incubated for 16-18 hr at 37° C. in the presence of 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\nAt the end of the incubation period, cells are harvested and transferred to 15 ml conical centrifuge tubes. After centrifugation for 10 min at 200×g, supernatants are harvested and transferred to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. It may be noted that the cell pellet may be utilized for a biochemical evaluation of pre-IL-1β and/or mature IL-1β content in cytosol extracts by western blotting or ELISA with pre-IL-1β specific antisera.\n\n\nIsolation of Adherent Mononuclear Cells:\n\n\nPBMC are isolated and prepared as described above. Media (1.0 ml) is first added to wells followed by 0.5 ml of the PBMC suspension. After a one hour incubation, plates are gently shaken and nonadherent cells aspirated from each well. Wells are then gently washed three times with 1.0 ml of media and final resuspended in 1.0 ml media. The enrichment for adherent cells generally yields 2.5−3.0×10\n5 \ncells per well. The addition of test compounds, LPS, cell incubation conditions and processing of supernatants proceeds as described above.\n\n\nELISA:\n\n\nWe have used Quantikine kits (R&D Systems) for measurement of mature IL-1β. Assays are performed according to the manufacturer's directions. Mature IL-1β levels of about 1-3 ng/ml in both PBMC and adherent mononuclear cell positive controls are observed. ELISA assays are performed on 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20 dilutions of supernatants from LPS-positive controls to select the optimal dilution for supernatants in the test panel.\n\n\nThe inhibitory potency of the compounds can be represented by an IC\n50 \nvalue, which is the concentration of inhibitor at which 50% of mature IL-1β is detected in the supernatant as compared to the positive controls.\n\n\nThe skilled practitioner realizes that values obtained in cell assays, such as those described herein, can depend on multiple factors, such as cell type, cell source, growth conditions and the like.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\nPharmacokinetic Studies In the Mouse\n\n\nPeptidyl ICE inhibitors are cleared rapidly with clearance rates greater than 100μ/min/kg. Compounds with lower clearance rates have improved pharmacokinetic properties relative to peptidyl ICE inhibitors.\n\n\nWe obtained the rate of clearance in the mouse (μ/min/kg) for several compounds of this Invention using the method described below:\n\n\nSample Preparation and Dosing\n\n\nCompounds were dissolved in sterile TRIS solution (0.02M or 0.05M) at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. Where necessary to ensure a complete solution, the sample was first dissolved in a minimum of dimethylacetamide (maximum of 5% of total solution volume) then diluted with the TRIS solution.\n\n\nThe drug solution was administered to CD-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories—26-31 g) via the tail vein at a dose volume of 10 ml/kg giving a drug dose of 25 mg/kg.\n\n\nMice were dosed in groups of 5 for each timepoint (generally from 2 minutes to 2 hours) then at the appropriate time the animals were anaesthetised with halothane and the blood collected into individual heparinized tubes by jugular severance. The blood samples were cooled to 0° C. then the plasma separated and stored at −20° C. until assayed.\n\n\nBioassay\n\n\nDrug concentration in the plasma samples were determined by HPLC analysis with UV or MS (ESP) detection. Reverse phase chromatography was employed using a variety of bonded phases from C1 to C18 with eluents composed of aqueous buffer/acetonitrile mixtures run under isocratic conditions.\n\n\nQuantitation was by external standard methods with calibration curves constructed by spiking plasma with drug solutions to give concentrations in the range of 0.5 to 50 μg/ml.\n\n\nPrior to analysis the plasma samples were deproteinated by the addition of acetonitrile, methanol, trichloroacetic acid or perchloric acid followed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 minutes. Sample volumes of 20 μl to 50 μl were injected for analysis.\n\n\n \nCompound\n 214e\n\n\nDosing and Sampling\n\n\nThe drug was dissolved in sterile 0.02M Tris to give a 2.5 mg/ml solution which was administered to 11 groups of 5 male CD-1 mice via the tail vein at a dose of 25 mg/kg. At each of the following timepoints: 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes a group of animals was anaesthetised and the blood collected into heparinized tubes. After separation the plasma was stored at −20° C. until assayed.\n\n\nAssay\n\n\nAliquots of plasma (150 μl) were treated with 5% perchloric acid (5 μl) then mixed by vortexing and allowed to stand for 90 minutes prior to centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was separated and 20 μl was injected for HPLC analysis.\n\n\nHPLC Conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHPLC Conditions\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nColumn\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n100 × 4.6 \nmm\n \n \nKromasil KR\n \n 100 5C4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMobile Phase\n\n\n0.1 m Tris pH 7.5\n\n\n86\n%\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAcetonitrile\n \n \n \n \n\n\n14\n%\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nFlowrate\n \n \n \n \n\n\n1 ml/min\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDetection\n\n\nUV at 210 nm\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRetention Time\n\n\n3.4 mins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the analysis indicated a decrease in the mean plasma level of the drug from ˜70 μg/ml at 2 minutes to <2 μg/ml at 90 and 120 minutes.\n\n\n \nCompound\n 217e\n\n\nDosing and Sampling\n\n\nThe drug was dissolved in sterile 0.02M Tris to give a 2.5 mg/ml solution which was administered to 11 groups of 5 male CD-1 mice via the tail vein at a dose of 25 mg/kg.

Drug (10 mg/mL) was administered via the jugular vein in a vehicle usually consisting of: propylene glycol/saline, containing 100 mM sodium bicarbonate in a 1:1 ratio. Animals were dosed with 10-20 mg drug/kg and blood samples were drawn at 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, and 90 minutes from an indwelling carotid catheter. The blood was centrifuged to plasma and stored at −20° C. until analysis. Pharmacokinetic analysis of data was performed by non-linear regression using standard software such as RStrip (MicroMath Software, UT) and/or Pcnonlin (SCI Software, NC) to obtain clearance values.\n\n\nAnalytical:\n\n\nRat plasma was extracted with an equal volume of acetonitrile (containing 0.1% TFA). Samples were then centrifuged at approximately 1,000×g and the supernatant analyzed by gradient HPLC. A typical assay procedure is described below.\n\n\n200 μL of plasma was precipitated with 200 μL of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in acetonitrile and 10 μL of a 50% aqueous zinc chloride solution, vortexed then centrifuged at ˜1000×g and the supernatant collected and analyzed by HPLC.\n\n\nHPLC Procedure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nColumn:\n\n\nZorbax SB-CN (4.6 × 150 mm) (5μ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nparticle size)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nColumn temperature:\n\n\n50° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFlow rate:\n\n\n1.0 mL/min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInjection volume:\n\n\n75 μL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMobile phase:\n\n\nA = 0.1% TFA in water and B = 100%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nacetonitrile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGradient employed:\n\n\n100% A to 30% A in 15.5 \nmin\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0% A at 16 \nmin\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100% A at 19.2 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWavelength:\n\n\n214 nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA standard curve was run at 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1 μg/mL concentrations.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\nWhole Blood Assay for IL-1β Production\n\n\nWe obtained IC\n50 \nvalues for several compounds of this invention using the method described below:\n\n\nPurpose:\n\n\nThe whole blood assay is a simple method for measuring the production of IL-1b (or other cytokines) and the activity of potential inhibitors. The complexity of this assay system, with its full complement of lymphoid and inflammatory cell types, spectrum of plasma proteins and red blood cells is an ideal in vitro representation of human in vivo physiologic conditions.\n\n\nMaterials:\n\n\nPyrogen-free syringes (˜30 cc)\n\n\nPyrogen-free sterile vacuum tubes containing lyophilized Na\n2\nEDTA (4.5 mg/10 ml tube)\n\n\nHuman whole blood sample (˜30-50 cc)\n\n\n1.5 ml eppendorf tubes\n\n\nTest compound stock solutions (˜25 mM in DMSO or other solvent)\n\n\nEndotoxin-free sodium chloride solution (0.9%) and HBSS Lipopolysaccharide (Sigma; Cat.# L-3012) stock solution at 1 mg/ml in HBSS\n\n\nIL-1β ELISA Kit (R & D Systems; Cat # DLB50)\n\n\nTNFα ELISA Kit (R & D Systems; Cat # DTA50)\n\n\nWater Bath or Incubator\n\n\nWhole Blood Assay Experimental Procedure:\n\n\nSet incubator or water bath at 30° C. Aliquot 0.25 ml of blood into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes. Note: be sure to invert the whole blood sample tubes after every two aliquots. Differences in replicates may result if the cells sediment and are not uniformly suspended. Use of a positive displacement pipette will also minimize differences between replicate aliquots.\n\n\nPrepare drug dilutions in sterile pyrogen-free saline by serial dilution. A dilution series which brackets the apparent K\ni \nfor a test compound determined in an ICE inhibition assay is generally used for the primary compound screen. For extremely hydrophobic compounds, we have prepared compound dilutions in fresh plasma obtained from the same blood donor or in PBS-containing 5% DMSO to enhance solubility.\n\n\nAdd 25 μl test compound dilution or vehicle control and gently mix the sample. Then add 5.0 μl LPS solution (250 ng/ml stocked prepared fresh: 5.0 ng/ml final concentration LPS), and mix again. Incubate the tubes at 30° C. in a water bath for 16-18 hr with occasional mixing. Alternatively, the tubes can be placed in a rotator set at 4 rpm for the same incubation period. This assay should be set up in duplicate or triplicate with the following controls: negative control—no LPS; positive control—no test inhibitor; vehicle control—the highest concentration of DMSO or compound solvent used in the experiment. Additional saline is added to all control tubes to normalize volumes for both control and experimental whole blood test samples\n\n\nAfter the incubation period, whole blood samples are centrifuged for 10 minutes at ˜2000 rpm in the microfuge, plasma is transferred to a fresh microfuge tube and centrifuged at 1000× g to pellet residual platelets if necessary. Plasma samples may be stored frozen at −70° C. prior to assay for cytokine levels by ELISA.\n\n\nELISA:\n\n\nWe have used R & D Systems (614 McKinley Place N.E. Minneapolis, Minn. 55413) Quantikine kits for measurement of IL-1β and TNF-α. The assays are performed according to the manufacturer's directions. We have observed IL-1β levels of ˜1-5 ng/ml in positive controls among a range of individuals. A 1:200 dilution of plasma for all samples has been sufficient in our experiments for ELISA results to fall on the linear range of the ELISA standard curves. It may be necessary to optimize standard dilutions if you observe differences in the whole blood assay. Nerad, J. L. et al., \nJ. Leukocyte Biol., \n52, pp. 687-692 (1992).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\nInhibition of ICE Homologs\n\n\n1. Isolation of ICE Homologs\n\n\nExpression of TX in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. We have subcloned Tx cDNA (Faucheu et al., supra 1995) into a modified pVL1393 transfer vector, co-transfected the resultant plasmid (pVL1393/TX) into insect cells with viral DNA and identified the recombinant baculovirus. After the generation of high titer recombinant virus stock, the medium was examined for TX activity using the visible\n\n\nICE assay. Typically, infection of \nSpodoptera frugiperda \n(Sf9) insect cells at an MOI of 5 with recombinant virus stock resulted in a maximum expression after 48 hours of 4.7 μg/ml. ICE was used as a standard in the assay.\n\n\nAmino terminal T7 tagged versions of ICE or TX were also expressed. Designed originally to assist the identification and purification of the recombinant proteins, the various constructs have also allowed examination of different levels of expression and of the relative levels of apoptosis experienced by the different homologs. Apoptosis in the infected Sf9 cells (examined using a Trypan Blue exclusion assay) was increased in the lines expressing ICE or TX relative to cells infected with the viral DNA alone.\n\n\nExpression and purification of N-terminally (His)\n6\n-tagged CPP32 in \nE. coli\n. A cDNA encoding a CPP32 (Fernandes-Alnemri et al, supra 1994) polypeptide starting at Ser (29) was PCR amplified with primers that add in frame XhoI sites to both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA and the resulting XhoI fragment ligated into a Xho I-cut pET-15b expression vector to create an in frame fusion with (his)\n6 \ntag at the n-terminus of the fusion protein. The predicted recombinant protein starts with the amino acid sequence of MGSS\nHHHHHH\nSSG\nLVPRGS\nHMLE (SEQ ID NO: 7), where LVPRGS (SEQ ID NO: 8) represents a thrombin cleavage site, followed by CPP32 starting at Ser (29). \nE. coli \nBL21 (DE3) carrying the plasmid were grown to log phase at 30° C. and were then induced with 0.8 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested two hours after IPTG addition. Lysates were prepared and soluble proteins were purified by Ni-agarose chromatography. All of the expressed CPP32 protein was in the processed form. N-terminal sequencing analysis indicated that the processing occurred at the authentic site between Asp (175) and Ser (176). Approximately 50 μg of CPP32 protein from 200 ml culture. As determined by active site titration, the purified proteins were fully active. The protease preparation were also very active in vitro in cleaving Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) as well as the synthetic DEVD-AMC (SEQ ID NO: 9) substrate (Nicholson et al, supra 1995).\n\n\n2. Inhibition of ICE Homologs\n\n\nThe selectivity of a panel of reversible inhibitors for ICE homologs is depicted in Table 1. ICE enzyme assays were performed according to Wilson et al (supra 1994) using a YVAD-AMC (SEQ ID NO: 10) substrate (Thornberry et al, supra 1992). Assay of TX activity was performed using the ICE substrate under identical conditions to ICE. Assay of CPP32 was performed using a DEVD-AMC (SEQ ID NO: 9) substrate (Nicholson et al., supra 1995). In general, there is low selectivity between ICE and TX for a wide range of scaffolds. None of the synthetic ICE compounds tested are effective inhibitors of CPP32. Assay of the reversible compounds at the highest concentration (1 μM) revealed no inhibition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nK\ni \nICE (nM)\n\n\nK\ni \nTX (nM)\n\n\nK\ni \nCPP32 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n214e\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n7.0 ± 1.1\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n135a\n\n\n90\n\n\n55 ± 9 \n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n125b\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n57 ± 13\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n137\n\n\n40\n\n\n40 ± 7 \n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond-order rate constants for inactivation of ICE and ICE homologs with selected irreversible inhibitors are presented below (Table 2).

Compounds were evaluated for their ability to block anti-Fas-induced apopotosis. In a preliminary experiment using RT-PCR, we detected mRNA encoding ICE, TX, ICH-1, CPP32 and CMH-1 in unstimulated U937 cells. We used this cell line for apoptosis studies. U937 cells were seeded in culture at 1×10\n5 \ncells/ml and grown to ˜5×10\n6 \ncells/ml. For apoptosis experiments, 2×10\n6 \ncells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates in 1 ml RPMI-1640-10% FBS and stimulated with 100 ng/ml anti-Fas antigen antibody (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Ltd.). After a 24 hr incubation at 37° C., the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by FACS analysis using ApoTag reagents.\n\n\nAll compounds were tested initially at 20 μM and titrations were performed with active compounds to determine IC\n50 \nvalues. Inhibition of apoptosis (>75% at 20 μM) was observed for 108a, 136, and 138. An IC\n50 \nof 0.8 μM was determined for 217e compared to no inhibition of anti-Fas-induced apoptosis by 214e at 20 μM.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\nIn Vivo Acute Assay for Efficacy as Anti-Inflammatory Agent\n\n\nLPS-Induced IL-1β Production.\n\n\nEfficacy of 214e and 217e was evaluated in CD1 mice (n=6 per condition) challenged with LPS (20 mg/kg IP). The test compounds were prepared in olive oil:DMSO:ethanol (90:5:5) and administered by IP injection one hour after LPS. Blood was collected seven hours after LPS challenge. Serum IL-1β levels were measure by ELISA. Results in \nFIG. 6\n show a dose dependent inhibition of IL-1β secretion by 214e, with an ED\n50 \nof approximately 15 mg/kg. Similar results were obtained in a second experiment. A significant inhibition of IL-1β secretion was also observed in 217e treated mice (\nFIG. 7\n). However, a clear dose response was not apparent.\n\n\n \n \nCompounds\n \n 214e and 217e (50 mg/kg) were also administered by oral gavage to assess absorption. Results in \nFIG. 8\n show that 214e, but not 217e when administered orally inhibited IL-1β secretion, suggesting potential for oral efficacy of ICE inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n\nThe efficacy of analogs of 214e were also evaluated in LPS challenged mice after IP administration (\nFIG. 9\n) and PO administration (\nFIG. 10\n).\n\n\nTable 3% Inhibition of IL-β Production by Analogs of 214e in LPS-Chellenged Mice after PO and IP Administration (50 mg/kg).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPO %\n\n\nIP %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCompound\n \n \nInhibition\n\n\nInhibition\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 214e\n\n\n75\n\n\n78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n265\n\n\n27\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n416\n\n\n52\n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n434\n\n\n80\n\n\n74\n\n\n\n\n\n\n438\n\n\n13\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n442\n\n\n10\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2002 \n\n\n—\n\n\n78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of 214e Prodrugs for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficacy in LPS Challenged Mice:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Course Inhibition of IL-1β Production\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTime of Compound Administration\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(relative to time of LPS challenge,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPO, 50 mg/kg\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\n−2 hr\n\n\n−1 \nhr\n \n\n\n0 hr\n\n\n+1 \nhr\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 214e\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n   55%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39*\n\n\n—*\n\n\n 80*\n\n\n 75*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n43*\n\n\n 44*\n\n\n 48*\n\n\n 11*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—*\n\n\n—*\n\n\n—*\n\n\n 47*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n304a\n \n\n\n30 \n\n\n33\n\n\n68\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2100e\n\n\n49 \n\n\n54\n\n\n94\n\n\n66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n2100a\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n71\n\n\n67\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n213e\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n48\n\n\n41\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 302\n\n\n0\n\n\n27\n\n\n21\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n2100c\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n 0\n\n\n85\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2100d\n\n\n42 \n\n\n35\n\n\n52\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n2100b\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n 0\n\n\n47\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2001\n\n\n~63 \n\n\n~62 \n\n\n~57 \n\n\n~54 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64*\n\n\n 62*\n\n\n 58*\n\n\n 55*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Values obtained in subsequent assays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\nMeasurement of Blood Levels of Prodrugs of 214e\n\n\nMice were administered a p.o. dose of \ncompounds\n 302 and 304a (50 mg/kg) prepared in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose.

The resin work-up and capping with 20% (v/v) Ac\n2\nO in DMF were performed as described for 401 to yield 402 (6.21 g, quantitative yield).\n\n\nStep C. Synthesis of 403. This compound was prepared from resin 402 (0.24 g, 0.038 mmol) using an Advanced ChemTech 396 Multiple Peptide synthesizer. The automated cycles consisted of a resin wash with DMF (3×1 mL), deprotection with 25% (v/v) piperidine in DMF (1 mL) for 3 min followed by fresh reagent (1 mL) for 10 min to yield resin 403. The resin was washed with DMF (3×1 mL) and N-methypyrrolidone (3×1 mL).\n\n\n \nStep D. Method\n 1. [3S(1S,9S)]-3-(6,10-Dioxo-1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10-octahydro-9-(thiophene-3-carbonylamino)-6H-pyridazine[1,2-a][1,2]diazepine-1-carboxamido)-4-oxobutanoic acid (409). Resin 403 was acylated with a solution of 0.4M thiophene-3-carboxylic acid and 0.4M HOBT in N-methypyrrolidone (1 mL), a solution of 0.4M HBTU in N-methylpyrrolidone (0.5 mL) and a solution of 1.6M DIEA in N-methypyrrolidone (0.35 mL) and the reaction was shaken for 2 hr at rt. The acylation step was repeated. Finally, the resin was washed with DMF (3×1 mL), CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(3×1 mL) and dried in vacuo. The aldehyde was cleaved from the resin and globally deprotected by treatment with 95% TFA/5% H\n2\nO (v/v, 1.5 mL) for 30 min at rt. After washing the resin with cleavage reagent (1 mL), the combined filtrates were added to cold 1:1 Et\n2\nO:pentane (12 mL) and the resulting precipitate was isolated by centrifugation and decantation. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 10% CH\n3\nCN/90% H\n2\nO/0.1% TFA (15 mL) and lyophilized to obtain crude 409 as a white powder. The compound was purified by semi-prep RP-HPLC with a Rainin Microsorb™ C18 column (5μ, 21.4×250 mm) eluting with a linear CH\n3\nCN gradient (5%-45%) containing 0.1% TFA (v/v) over 45 min at 12 mL/min. Fractions containing the desired product were pooled and lyophilized to provide 409 (10.8 mg, 63%).\n\n\nStep D. Method 1A. Synthesis of 418. Following a similar procedure as \nmethod\n 1, resin 403 was acylated with 4-(1-fluorenylmethoxycarbonylamino)benzoic acid and repeated. The Fmoc group was removed as described in Step C and the free amine was acetylated with 20% (v/v) Ac\n2\nO in DMF (1 mL) and 1.6M DIEA in N-methylpyrrolidone (0.35 mL) for 2 hr at rt. The acetylation step was repeated. Cleavage of the aldehyde from the resin gave 418 (3.2 mg).\n\n\nStep D. Method 1B. Synthesis of 447. Following a similar procedure as method 1A, resin 403 was acylated with 0.4M 4-(1-fluorenylmethoxycarbonylamino)benzoic acid. The acylation step was repeated once. The Fmoc group was removed as before and the free amine was reacted with 1M methanesulfonyl chloride in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(0.5 mL) and 1M pyridine in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(0.60 mL) for 4 hr at rt. Cleavage of the aldehyde from the resin gave 447 (10.0 mg).\n\n\n \nStep D. Method\n 2. Synthesis of 214e. Following a similar procedure as \nmethod\n 1, resin 403 was acylated with 0.5M benzoyl chloride in N-methypyrrolidone (1 mL) and 1.6M DIEA in N-methypyrrolidone (0.35 mL) for 2 hr at rt. The acylation step was repeated. Cleavage of the aldehyde from the resin gave 214e (5.1 mg, 30%).\n\n\n \nStep D. Method\n 3. Synthesis of 427. Following a similar procedure as \nmethod\n 1, resin 403 was reacted with 1.0M benzenesulfonyl chloride in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(0.5 mL) and 1M pyridine in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(0.60 mL) for 4 hr at rt. The reaction was repeated. Cleavage of the aldehyde from the resin gave 427 (7.2 mg, 40%).\n\n\n \nStep D. Method\n 4. Synthesis of 420. Following a similar procedure as \nmethod\n 1, resin 403 was reacted with 0.5M methylisocyanate in N-methypyrrolidone (1 mL) and 1.6M DIEA in N-methypyrrolidone (0.35 mL) for 2 hr at rt. The reaction was repeated. Cleavage of the aldehyde from the resin gave 420 (8.3 mg, 55%).\n\n\n \nStep D. Method\n 5. Synthesis of 445. Following a similar procedure at \nmethod\n 1, resin 403 was acylated with 0.27M imidazole-2-carboxylic acid (1 mL) in 2:1 DMF:H\n2\nO (with 1 eq. DIEA) and 1M 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) in 2:1 N-methypyrrolidone/H\n2\nO (0.35 mL) for 3 hr at rt. Cleavage of the aldehyde from the resin gave 445 (9.5 mg).\n\n\nAnalytical HPLC Methods:\n\n\n(1) Waters DeltaPak C18, 300 Å (5μ, 3.9×150 mm).

(2S)-2-tert-Butoxycarbonylamino-3-(2-nitrophenyl-amino)-propionic acid. (2S)-2-tert-Butoxycarbonylamino-3-aminopropionic acid (10 g, 49 mmol), 2-fluoronitrobenzene (5.7 ml, 54 mmol), and NaHCO\n3 \n(8.25 g, 98 mmol) was taken into 130 ml of DMF and heated at 80° C. for 18 h.

Synthesis of 614. TentaGel S® NH\n2 \nresin (0.16 mmol/g, 10.0 g) was placed in a sintered glass funnel and washed with dimethylformamide (3×50 mL), 10% (v/v) diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) in dimethylformamide (2×50 mL) and finally with dimethylformamide (4×50 mL). Sufficient dimethylformamide was added to the resin to obtain a slurry followed by 400 (1.42 g, 2.4 mmol, prepared from (3S)3-(fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl)-4-oxobutryic acid t-butyl ester according to A. M. Murphy et. al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc., \n114, 3156-3157 (1992)), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBT.H\n2\nO; 0.367 g, 2.4 mmol), O-benzotriazole-N,N,N,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU; 0.91 g, 2.4 mmol), and DIEA (0.55 mL, 3.2 mmol). The reaction mixture was agitated overnight at room temperature using a wrist arm shaker. The resin was isolated on a sintered glass funnel by suction filtration and washed with dimethylformamide (3×50 mL). Unreacted amine groups were then capped by reacting the resin with 20% (v/v) acetic anhydride/dimethylformamide (2×25 mL) directly in the funnel (10 min/wash). The resin was washed with dimethylformamide (3×50 mL) and dichloromethane (3×50 mL) prior to drying overnight in vacuo to yield 614 (11.0 g, quantitative yield).\n\n\nStep B. Synthesis of 616. Resin 614 (3.0 g, 0.16 mmol/g, 0.48 mmol) was swelled in a sintered glass funnel by washing with dimethylformamide (3×15 mL). The Fmoc protecting group was then cleaved with 25% (v/v) piperidine/dimethylformamide (15 mL) for 10 min (intermittent stirring) and then for 20 min with fresh piperidine reagent (15 ml). The resin was then washed with dimethylformamide (3×15 ml), followed by N-methypyrrolidone (2×15 mL). After transferring the resin to a 100 mL flask, N-methypyrrolidone was added to obtain a slurry followed by 603u (0.736 g, 0.72 mmol), HOBT.H\n2\nO (0.112 g, 0.73 mmol), HBTU (0.27 g, 0.73 mmol) and DIEA (0.26 mL, 1.5 mmol). The reaction mixture was agitated overnight at room temperature using a wrist arm shaker. The resin work-up and capping with 20% (v/v) acetic anhydride in dimethylformamide were performed as described for 614 to yield 616 (3.13 g, quantitative yield).\n\n\nStep C. Synthesis of 617. This compound was prepared from resin 616 (0.24 g, 0.038 mmol) using an\n\n\nAdvanced ChemTech 396 Multiple Peptide synthesizer.\n\n\nThe automated cycles consisted of a resin wash with dimethylformamide (3×1 mL), deprotection with 25% (v/v) piperidine in dimethylformamide (1 mL) for 3 min followed by fresh reagent (1 mL) for 10 min to yield resin 617. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide (3×1 mL) and N-methypyrrolidone (3×1 mL).\n\n\n \nStep D. Method\n 1. (624). Resin 617 was acylated with a solution of 0.4M thiophene-3-carboxylic acid and 0.4M HOBT in N-methypyrrolidone (1 mL), a solution of 0.4M HBTU in N-methylpyrrolidone (0.5 mL) and a solution of 1.6M DIEA in N-methypyrrolidone (0.35 mL) and the reaction was shaken for 2 hr at room temperature. The acylation step was repeated. Finally, the resin was washed with dimethylformamide (3×1 mL), dichloromethane (3×1 mL) and dried in vacuo. The aldehyde was cleaved from the resin and globally deprotected by treatment with 95% TFA/5% H2O (v/v, 1.5 mL) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing the resin with cleavage reagent (1 mL), the combined filtrates were added to cold 1:1 ether:pentane (12 mL) and the resulting precipitate was isolated by centrifugation and decantation. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 10% acetonitrile/90% H\n2\nO/0.1% TFA (15 mL) and lyophilized to obtain crude 624 as a white powder. The compound was purified by semi-prep RP-HPLC with a Rainin Microsorb™ C18 column (5u, 21.4×250 mm) eluting with a linear acetonitrile gradient (5%-45%) containing 0.1% TFA (v/v) over 45 min at 12 mL/min. Fractions containing the desired product were pooled and lyophilized to provide 624 (10.0 mg, 54%).\n\n\nStep D. Method 1A. Synthesis of 627. Following a similar procedure as \nmethod\n 1, resin 617 was acylated with 4-(1-fluorenylmethoxycarbonylamino)benzoic acid and repeated. The Fmoc group was removed as described in Step C and the free amine was acetylated with 20% (v/v) acetic anhydride in dimethylformamide (1 mL) and 1.6M DIEA in N-methylpyrrolidone (0.35 mL) for 2 hr at room temperature. The acetylation step was repeated. Cleavage of the aldehyde from the resin gave 627 (4.2 mg, 20%).\n\n\n \nStep D. Method\n 2. Synthesis of 632. Following a similar procedure as \nmethod\n 1, resin 617 was acylated with 0.5M cinnamoyl chloride in N-methypyrrolidone (1 mL) and 1.6M DIEA in N-methypyrrolidone (0.35 mL) for 2 hr at room temperature. The acylation step was repeated. Cleavage of the aldehyde from the resin gave 632 (11.1 mg, 58%).\n\n\n \nStep D. Method\n 3. Synthesis of 629. Following a similar procedure as \nmethod\n 1, resin 617 was reacted with 1.0M benzenesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane (0.5 mL) and 1M pyridine in dichloromethane (0.60 mL) for 4 hr at room temperature. The reaction was repeated. Cleavage of the aldehyde from the resin 629 (4.7 mg, 24%).\n\n\nAnalytical HPLC Methods:\n\n\n(1) Waters DeltaPak C18, 300 A (5u, 3.9×150 mm).

Drugs are administered by oral gavage in ethanol/PEG/water, β-cyclodextrin, labrosol/water or cremophor/water vehicle. The mice are sacrificed at 4 hours post carrageenan administration, then injected IP with 2 ml of saline containing 5 U/ml heparin. After gentle massage of the peritoneum, a small incision is made, the contents collected and volume recorded.

H., \nMethods in Enzmmology, \n162, pp. 361-373 (1988) and Geiger, T., \nClinical and Experimental Rheumatology, \n11, pp. 515-522 (1993)). Chick sternum Type II collagen (4 mg/kg in 10 mM acetic acid) was emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) by repeated passages (400) between two 10 ml glass syringes with a \ngauge\n 16 double-hub needle. Mice were immunized by intradermal injection (50 μl; 100 μl CII per mouse) of \ncollagen emulsion\n 21 days later at the contra-lateral side of the tail base. Drugs were administered twice a day (10, 25 and 50 mg/kg) by oral gavage approximately 7 h apart. Vehicles used included ethanol/PEG/water, β-cyclodextrin, labrosol/water or cremophor/water. Drug treatments were initiated within 2 h of the CII booster immunization. Inflammation was scored on a 1 to 4 scale of increasing severity on the two front paws and the scores are added to give the final score.\n\n\nResults in the \nFIGS. 12\n, \n13\n and \n14\n show prodrugs 412f, 412d and 696a inhibit inflammation in collagen-induced arthritits in mice after oral administration. Compound 214e did not inhibit inflammation when dosed (50 mg/kg) once a day by oral gavage.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 22\n\n\nIn Vivo Bioavailability Determination\n\n\nThe drugs (10-100 mg/kg) were dosed orally to rats (10 mL/kg) in ethanol/PEG/water, β-cyclodextrin, labrosol/water or cremophor/water. Blood samples were drawn from the carotid artery at 0.25, 0.50, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours after dosing, centrifuged to plasma and stored at −70° C. until analysis. Aldehyde concentrations were determined using an enzymatic assay. Pharmacokinetic analysis of data was performed by non-linear regression using RStrip (MicroMath Software, UT). Drug availability values were determined as follows: (AUC of drug after oral prodrug dosing/AUC of drug after i.v. dosing of drug)×(dose i.v./dose p.o.)×100%.\n\n\nResults in Table 21 show that prodrugs 412f, 412d and 696a give significant blood levels of drug and have good drug availability when dosed orally.

Okamura et al., Nature, 378, p. 88 (1995) was ligated into the mammalian expression vector pCDLSRα (Y. Takebe et al., \nMol. Cell. Biol., \n8, p. 466 (1988)).\n\n\nGenerally, plasmids (3 μg) encoding active ICE (above), or the three ICE-related enzymes TX, CPP32, and CMH-1 in the pCDLSRα expression vector (C. Faucheu et al., \nEMBO, \n14, p. 1914 (1995); Y. Gu et al., \nEMBO, \n14, p. 1923 (1995); J. A. Lippke et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n271, p. 1825 (1996)), were transfected into subconfluent monolayers of Cos cells in 35-mm dishes using the DEAE-dextran method (Y. Gu et al., \nEMBO J., \n14, p. 1923 (1995)). Twenty-four hours later, cells were lysed and the lysates subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using an antiserum specific for IGIF (H. Okamura et al., \nNature, \n378, p. 88 (1995).\n\n\nPolymerase chain reaction was used to introduce Nde I sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the murine pro-IGIF cDNA using the following primers: GGAATTCCATATGGCTGCCATGTCAGAAGAC (forward, SEQ ID NO: 11) and GGTTAACCATATGCTAACTTTGATGTAAGTTAGTGAG (reverse, SEQ ID NO: 12) The resulting NdeI fragment was ligated into \nE. coli \nexpression vector pET-15B (Novagen) at the NdeI site to create a plasmid that directs the synthesis of a polypeptide of 213 amino acids consisting of a 21-residue peptide (MGSS\nHHHHHH\nSSG\nLVPRGS\nHM (SEQ ID NO: 13), where LVPRGS (SEQ ID NO: 8) represents a thrombin cleavage site) fused in-frame to the N-terminus of pro-IGIF at Ala2, as confirmed by DNA sequencing of the plasmid and by N-terminal sequencing of the expressed proteins. \nE. coli \nstrain BL21 (DE3) carrying the plasmid was induced with 0.8 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 1.5 hours at 37° C., harvested, and lysed by microfluidization (Microfluidic, Watertown, Mass.) in Buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000×g for 30 mM. (His)6-tagged pro-IGIF protein was then purified from the supernatant by Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography under conditions recommended by the manufacturer.\n\n\nIn Vitro Pro-IGIF Cleavage Reactions\n\n\nIn vitro cleavage reactions (30 μl) contained 2 μg of purified pro-IGIF and various concentrations of the purified proteases in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin and were incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. Conditions for cleavage by granzyme B were as described previously (Y. Gu et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n271, p. 10816 (1996)). Cleavage products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 16% gels and Coomassie Blue staining, and were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing using an ABI automated peptide sequencer under conditions recommended by the manufacturer.\n\n\nKinetic Parameters of IGIF Cleavage by ICE\n\n\nThe kinetic parameters (k\ncat\n/K\nM\n, K\nM\n, and k\ncat\n) for IGIF cleavage by ICE were determined as follows. \n35\nS-methionine-labeled pro-IGIF (3000 cpm, prepared by in vitro transcription and translation using, the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and pro-IGIF cDNA in a pSP73 vector as template) were incubated in reaction mixtures of 60 μl containing 0.1 to 1 nM recombinant ICE and 190 nM to 12 μM of unlabeled pro-IGIF for 8-10 min at 37° C. Cleavage product concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE and PhosphoImager analyses. The kinetic parameters were calculated by nonlinear regression fitting of the rate vs. concentration data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the program Enzfitter (Biosoft).\n\n\nIFN-γ Induction Assays\n\n\nA.E7 Th1 cells (H. Quill and R. H. Schwartz, \nJ. Immunol., \n138, p. 3704 (1987)) (1.3×10\n5 \ncells in 0.15 ml Click's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol and 50 units/ml IL-2) in 96-well plates were treated with IGIF for 18-20 hours and the culture supernatant were assayed for IFN-γ by ELISA (Endogen, Cambridge, Mass.).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 24\n\n\nProcessing of Pro-IGIF by ICE In Cos Cells\n\n\nCos cells were transfected with various expression plasmid combinations as described in Example 23. Transfected Cos cells (3.5×10\n5 \ncells in a 35-mm dish) were labeled for 7 hours with 1 ml of methionine-free DMEM containing 2.5% normal DMEM, 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 300 μCi/ml \n35\nS-methionine (\n35\nS-Express Protein Labeling-Mix, New England Nuclear). Cell lysates (prepared in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mM PMSF, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptine) or conditioned medium were immunoprecipitated with an antiIGIF antibody that recognizes both the precursor and the mature forms of IGIF (H. Okamura et al., \nNature, \n378, p. 88 (1995)). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and fluorography (\nFIG. 2A\n).\n\n\nWe also measured the presence of IFN-γ inducing activity in the cell lysates and the conditioned media of transfected cells (\nFIG. 2B\n). Transfected Cos cells (3.5×10\n5 \ncells in a 35-mm dish) were grown in 1 ml medium for 18 hours. Media was harvested and used at 1:10 final dilution in the IFN-γ induction assay (Example 23). Cos cell pellets from the same transfection were lysed in 100 μl of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, by freeze-\nthawing\n 3 times. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation as described above and were used at a 1:10 dilution in the assay.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 25\n\n\nIGIF is a Physiological Substrate of ICE\n\n\nWild type (ICE+/+) and ICE−/− mice were primed with heat-inactivated \nP. acnes\n, and Kupffer cells were isolated from these \nmice\n 7 days after priming and were then challenged with 1 μg/ml LPS for 3 hours. The amounts of IGIF in the conditioned media were measured by ELISA.\n\n\nWild type or ICE-deficient mice were injected intraperitoneally with heat-killed \np. acnes \nas described (H. Okamura et al., \nInfection and Immunity, \n63, p. 3966 (1995)). Kupffer cells were prepared seven days later according to Tsutsui et al. (H. Tsutsui et al., \nHepato\n-\nGastroenterol., \n39, p. 553 (1992)) except a nycodenz gradient was used instead of metrizamide. For each experiment, Kupffer cells from 2-3 animals were pooled and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 μg/ml LPS. Cell lysates and conditioned medium were prepared 3 hours later.\n\n\nKupffer cells from wild type and ICE−/− mice were metabolically labeled with \n35\nS-methionine as for Cos cells (described above in Example 24) except that methionine-free RPMI 1640 was used in place of DMEM. IGIF immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on cell lysates and conditioned media and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography as described in Example 23. See \nFIG. 3\n.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 26\n\n\nInduction of IFN-γ Production In Vivo\n\n\nLPS mixed with 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose in PBS, pH 7.4, was administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection (30 mg/kg LPS) in a dose volume of 10 ml/kg. Blood was collected every 3 h for 24 h from groups of three ICE-deficient or wild type mice. Serum IFN-γ levels were determined by ELISA (Endogen).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 27\n\n\nIGIF and IFN-γ Inhibition Assays\n\n\nInhibition of IGIF processing by ICE inhibitors was measured in ICE inhibition assays as described herein (see Example 1 and Table 22).\n\n\nHuman PBMC Assays\n\n\nHuman buffy coat cells were obtained from blood donors and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by centrifugation in LeukoPrep tubes (Becton-Dickinson, Lincoln Park, N.J.). PBMC were added (3×10\n6\n/well) to 24 well Corning tissue culture plates and after 1 hr incubation at 37° C., non-adherent cells were removed by gently washing. Adherent mononuclear cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) with or without ICE inhibitor in 2 ml RPMI-1640-10% FBS. After 16-18 hr incubation at 37° C., IGIF and IFN-γ were quantitated in culture supernatants by ELISA.\n\n\nFor example, we obtained the following data for compound 412 of this invention using the methods described herein. The structure of compound 412 is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUV-Visible\n\n\nCell PBMC\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompound\n\n\nK\ni \n(nM)\n\n\navg.

The following illustrates a preferred method:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a solution of A (1.1 equivalent) in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(or DMF, or CH\n2\nCl\n2\n:DMF (1:1)) is added triphenylphosphine (0-0.5 equivalent), a nucleophilic scavenger (2-50 equivalents) and tetrakis-triphenylphosphine palladium(0) (0.05-0.1 equivalent) at ambient temperature under inert atmosphere (nitrogen or argon). After 10 minutes, the above reaction mixture is optionally concentrated, then a solution of acid A-I or A-II in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(or DMF, or CH\n2\nCl\n2\n:DMF (1:1)) is added followed by addition of HOBT (1.1 equivalent) and EDC (1.1 equivalent). The resulting reaction mixture is allowed to stir at \nambient temperature\n 1 hour-48 hours to provide coupled products C-I or C-II.\n\n\nVarious nucleophilic scavengers may be used in the above process. Merzouk and Guibe, \nTetrahedron Letters, \n33, pp. 477-480 (1992); Guibe and Balavoine, \nJournal of Organic Chemistry, \n52, pp. 4984-4993 (1987)). Preferred nucleophilic scavengers that may be used include: dimedone, morpholine, trimethylsilyl dimethylamine and dimethyl barbituric acid. More preferred nuclophilic scavengers are trimethylsilyl dimethylamine (2-5 equivalents) and dimethyl barbituric (5-50 equivalents). When the nucleophilic scavenger is trimethylsilyl dimethylamine, the above reaction mixture must be concentrated prior to addition of A-I or A-II.\n\n\nOther compounds of this invention may be prepared by hydrolyzing compounds represented by C-I and C-II to compounds represented by H-I and H-II as described in the following scheme:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe hydrolysis may be carried out under various conditions, provided that the conditions include an acid and H\n2\nO. Acids that may be used include p-toluensulfonic, methanesulfonic acid, sulfuric, perchloric, trifluoroacetic, and hydrochloric. For example, trifluoroacetic acid (1-90% by weight) or hydrochloric acid (0.1-30% by weight) in CH\n3\nCN/H\n2\nO (1-90% H\n2\nO by weight) at between 0-50° C. may be used.\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE

Synthesis of 401. TentaGel S® NH\n2 \nresin (0.25 mmol/g, 5.25 g) was placed in a sintered glass shaker vessel and washed with dimethylacetamide (3×15 mL). Compound 400 (1.36 g, 2.3 mmol) was dissolved in DMA (10 mL) and O-benzotriazole-N,N,N,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU; 0.88 g, 2.3 mmol), and DIEA (0.8 mL, 4.6 mmol) were added. The solution was transferred to the resin and a further 5 mL DMA added. The reaction mixture was agitated for 1.5 h at room temperature using a wrist arm shaker. The resin was filtered and washed with dimethylacetamide (4×15 mL).\n\n\nStep B. Synthesis of 1102. Resin 401 was deprotected with 20% (v/v) piperidine/dimethylacetamide (15 mL) for 10 min (shaking) and then for 10 min with fresh piperidine reagent (15 ml). The resin was then washed with dimethylacetamide (6×15 ml), followed by N-methypyrrolidone (2×25 mL).\n\n\nCompound 1101 (0.979 g, 2.11 mmol) was dissolved in dimethylacetamide (8 mL). HBTU (0.81 g, 2.1 mmol) and DIEA (0.75 mL, 4.3 mmol) were added and the solution added to the resin, followed by dimethylacetamide (4 mL). The reaction mixture was agitated for 2 h at room temperature using a wrist arm shaker. The resin work-up was performed as described for 401 to yield 1102.\n\n\nStep C. Synthesis of 1103. This compound was prepared from resin 1102 (0.040 mmol) using an Advanced ChemTech 396 Multiple Peptide synthesizer. The automated cycles consisted of a resin wash with dimethylformamide (2×1 mL), deprotection with 25% (v/v) piperidine in dimethylformamide (1 mL) for 3 min followed by fresh reagent (1 mL) for 10, min to yield resin 1103. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide (3×1 mL) and N-methylpyrrolidone (3×1 mL).\n\n\nResin 1103 was acylated with a solution of 0.4M carboxylic acid and 0.4M HOBT in N-methypyrrolidone (0.5 mL), a solution of 0.4M HBTU in N-methylpyrrolidone (0.5 mL) and a solution of 1.6M DIEA in N-methylpyrrolidone (0.25 mL) and the reaction was shaken for 2 hr at room temperature. The acylation step was repeated. Finally, the resin was washed with N-methylpyrrolidone (1×1 mL), dimethylformamide (4×1 mL), dichloromethane (5×1 mL) and dried in vacuo. The aldehyde was cleaved from the resin and globally deprotected by treatment with 95% TFA/5% H\n2\nO (v/v, 1.5 mL) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing the resin with cleavage reagent (1 mL), the combined filtrates were added to cold 1:1 ether:hexane (10 mL) and the resulting precipitate was isolated by centrifugation and decantation. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 10% acetonitrile/90% H\n2\nO/0.1% TFA (5 mL) and lyophilized to obtain crude 1105-1125 as a white powder. The compound was purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC with a Rainin Microsorb™ C18 column (5μ, 21.4×250 mm) eluting with a linear acetonitrile gradient (8%-48%) containing 0.1% TFA (v/v) over 30 min at 12 mL/min.

Synthesis of 401. TentaGel S® NH\n2 \nresin (0.25 mmol/g, 6.8 g) was placed in a glass shaker vessel and washed with dimethylacetamide (3×20 mL). To a solution of 400 (1.70 g, 2.9 mmol, prepared from (3S)3-(fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl)-4-oxobutryic acid t-butyl ester according to A. M. Murphy et. al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc., \n114, 3156-3157 (1992)) in dimethylacetamide (15 mL) was added O-benzotriazole-N,N,N,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU; 1.09 g, 2.9 mmol), and DIEA (1.0 mL, 5.7 mmol). The solution was added to the resin, followed by dimethylacetamide (5 mL). The reaction mixture was agitated for 3 h at room temperature using a wrist arm shaker. The resin was isolated by suction filtration and washed with dimethylacetamide (6×20 mL). A sample of resin (7.4 mg) was thoroughly washed with 50% methanol in dichloromethane and dried under suction. Deprotection of the Fmoc group using 20% piperidine in dimethylacetamide (10.0 mL) and UV analysis of the solution revealed a substitution of 0.19 mmol g\n−1\n.\n\n\nStep B. Synthesis of 903. Resin 401 was deprotected with 20% (v/v) piperidine/dimethylacetamide (20 mL) for 10 min (shaking) and then for 10 min with fresh piperidine reagent (20 ml). The resin was then washed with dimethylacetamide (6×20 ml). A solution of 902 (1.52 g, 2.81 mmol) was treated with HBTU (1.07 g, 2.83 mmol) and DIEA (1.0 mL, 5.7 mmol) and transferred to the resin, followed by dimethylacetamide (5 mL). The reaction mixture was agitated for 2.5 h at room temperature using a wrist arm shaker. The resin was isolated by suction filtration and washed with dimethylacetamide (4×20 mL) and dichloromethane (4×20 mL), and dried under nitrogen purge. Resin substitution was performed as described for 401 and determined to be 0.169 mmol g\n−1\n.\n\n\nStep C. Synthesis of 905. Resin 903 (7.54 g, 1.27 mmol) and dimedone (2.19 g, 15.6 mmol) were placed in a 100 mL round bottomed flask and freshly distilled anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (60 mL) was added. Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0) (0.32 g, 0.28 mmol) was added and the nitrogen blanketed, sealed reaction was agitated for 15 h on a wrist action shaker. The resin was filtered, washed with dimethylacetamide (4×20 mL), dichloromethane (4×20 mL) and dimethylacetamide (1×20 mL). Sufficient dimethylacetamide was added to the resin to obtain a slurry followed by pyridine (1.5 mL, 18.5 mmol) and a solution of 904 (5.5 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL). The reaction was shaken under nitrogen for 8 h, then filtered. The resin was washed with dimethylacetamide (5×20 mL) and dichloromethane (5×20 mL).\n\n\nStep D. Synthesis of 906. This compound was prepared from resin 905 (0.24 g, 0.038 mmol) using an Advanced ChemTech 396 Multiple Peptide synthesizer. The automated cycles consisted of a resin wash with dimethylformamide (3×1 mL), deprotection with 25% (v/v) piperidine in dimethylformamide (1 mL) for 10 min followed by fresh reagent (1 mL) for 20 min to yield resin 906. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide (3×1 mL) and N-methypyrrolidone (3×1 mL).\n\n\nStep E. (910-922) Resin 906 was acylated with a solution of 0.4M carboxylic acid and 0.4M HOBT in N-methypyrrolidone (0.5 mL), a solution of 0.4M HBTU in N-methylpyrrolidone (0.5 mL) and a solution of 1.6M DIEA in N-methypyrrolidone (0.25 mL) and the reaction was shaken for 2 hr at room temperature. The resin was washed with N-methylpyrrolidone (1×1 mL), dimethylformamide (4×1 mL), 50% methanol in dichloromethane (5×1 mL) and dried in air. The aldehyde was cleaved from the resin and globally deprotected by treatment with 95% TFA/5% H\n2\nO (v/v, 1.5 mL) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing the resin with cleavage reagent (2×1 mL), the combined filtrates were added to cold 1:1 ether:hexane (35 mL) and the resulting precipitate was isolated by centrifugation and decantation. The resulting pellet was dissolved in acetonitrile (0.5 mL) and H\n2\nO (0.5 mL) and filtered through 0.45 micron microcentrifuge filters. The compound was purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC with a Rainin Microsorb™ C18 column (5μ, 21.4×250 mm) eluting with a linear acetonitrile gradient (10%-50%) containing 0.1% TFA (v/v) over 30 min at 12 mL/min.

In early PCa, anti-androgen therapy (AAT) is almost universally effective. This consists of one or more combinations of GnRH agonists (to suppress pituitary signaling), aromatase inhibitors (to decrease androgen production), and competitive AR antagonists (to block AR directly) such as hydroxy-flutamide (OH-F) or bicalutamide (BiC). This strategy usually works for several years, but over time tumor cells evolve mechanisms for continued growth under these conditions of androgen depletion. Most recurrent, or hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) is nonetheless dependent on AR-mediated signaling. This can include upregulation of AR protein expression levels, acquisition of mutations within AR that increase its activity in response to alternative hormones (including antagonists), or upregulation of co-activator proteins that augment AR activity. Thus, it is likely that new approaches to block AR activity could significantly extend or increase the effectiveness of AAT. This could consist of better competitive antagonists, and considerable efforts from pharmaceutical companies are already being brought to bear on this approach. For example, pyrvinium has shown efficacy against tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in mouse models (see WO2006/078754 and \nCancer Cell \n2006, 10, 321). This implies that novel anti-androgens might have considerable utility in the treatment of both primary and recurrent PCa. Such anti-androgens might not be competitive antagonists that directly bind AR, and could conceivably function via inhibition of downstream events in AR signaling. Accordingly, there is a need for novel, potent anti-androgens. Surprisingly, this invention meets this, and other, needs.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the present invention provides a compound of Formula I:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare each independently hydrogen or C\n1-6 \nalkyl.

Compound screening strategy. Novel inhibitors of AR conformation change were discovered by creating a HEK-293 (ATCC CRL-1573)-derived cell line stably expressing a CFP N-terminal and YFP C-terminal tagged AR vector that has been previously used to measure conformation change by FRET. C-AR-Y was stably expressed in either LAPC4 or HEK293 cell lines; in parallel, HEK293 cells were transfected with native AR along with MMTV-luciferase. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 10 nM DHT and one of 1040 FDA-approved drugs. The screen was performed in duplicate for each condition, and the top 50 compounds with activities in both trials were selected. Each of the top compounds was evaluated in detail with a dose-response study, and the “validated” compounds were compared across all assays. The validated hits accounted for approximately 40% of the hits initially identified for each screen.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n. Analysis of hits. 1040 FDA-approved drugs were tested in three different assays, a transcription-based assay using HEK293 cells expressing MMTV-luciferase, conformation-based assays using HEK293/C-AR-Y stable cells, and LAPC4/C-AR-Y stable cells. Fewer compounds affected AR conformational change vs. transcriptional output. LAPC4 cells were the least sensitive to test compounds. High selectivity (<50 hits) was observed for the transcription assay when the cutoff was set between 5 and 6 standard deviations (SD) from the mean (as determined by multiple replicates of cells treated only with DHT). Similar selectivity was observed for the HEK293/C-AR-Y cells between 3 and 4 SD, whereas in the LAPC4/C-AR-Y cells such effects were observed between 2 and 3 SD from the mean. The transcriptional assay used in the screen had a Z-factor=0.6, vs. 0.6 for the LAPC4 FRET assay and 0.5 for the HEK293 FRET assay (Zhang, J. H., T. D. Chung, and K. R. Oldenburg, \nA Simple Statistical Parameter for Use in Evaluation and Validation of High Throughput Screening Assays\n. J Biomol Screen, 1999. 4(2): p. 67-73).\n\n\n \nFIG. 3\n. Characterization of hits in primary screen. (A) Hits that scored in the primary assays were ranked according to efficacy based on the average of duplicate readings, and the \ntop\n 50 from each assay was compared to the other two. In each case, a minority of compounds were shared between the assays, and most hits were unique to a particular system. (B) Validated hits were determined by detailed dose-response in the original assay used, and only compounds that exhibited pharmacologic effects were counted. These hits were then cross-compared to the other screening assays, using a dose-response. In this secondary analysis, the majority of hits from any one assay were also effective in another assay system.\n\n\n \nFIG. 4\n. Pyrvinium pamoate (PP) exhibits identical responses vs. pyrvinium chloride (PCl). Anion exchange was used to replace the pamoate salt with a chloride ion. The resulting compound, PCl, had an identical dose-response vs. the parent compound in blocking PSA reporter activity in LAPC4 cells.\n\n\n \nFIG. 5\n. PP and HH inhibit DHT-induced gene expression differently than a competitive antagonist. LNCaP cells transiently transfected with a PSA-luciferase reporter were exposed to OH-F, PP and HH. DHT was titrated. Whereas OH-F caused a modified DHT dose-response consistent with a competitive antagonist, PP and HH exhibited a pattern consistent with a non-competitive antagonist.\n\n\n \nFIG. 6\n. PP and HH inhibit androgen-induced cell proliferation. PP, HH, and BiC were compared for their ability to inhibit androgen dependent and independent growth in several cultured cell lines: LNCaP, LAPC4, LN-AR (a line that exhibits androgen-independent growth), and HEK293 cells. PP and HH each exhibited growth-inhibitory properties in LNCaP cells, whereas HH was not effective in LAPC4 cells. Neither compound exhibited non-specific growth inhibition of HEK293 cells. Importantly, PP blocked growth of “hormone refractory” LN-AR cells. Asterisk (*)=p<0.005.\n\n\n \nFIG. 7\n. PP synergistically reduces prostate size in mice. Cohorts of nine male mice were treated with PO gavage of BiC (100 mg/kg), IP injection of PP (1 mg/kg), or the combination for four weeks. As a positive control, nine mice were treated with castration for four weeks. Prostate glands were harvested and wet weights determined. PP alone did not significantly reduce prostate size. BiC treatment significantly reduced prostate weight by 35%, and the combination of PP:BiC reduced the weight by 63% (p<0.0005, t-test), implying a synergistic effect of PP. cntrl: untreated mice; BiC: bicalutamide; PP: pyrvinium pamoate; cast: castrated. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (S.E.M.).\n\n\n \nFIG. 8\n. PP suppresses androgen-dependent gene expression in the prostate, and augments BiC activity. Total RNA was extracted from prostate glands of cohorts of 9 mice used to test PP in vivo. qRT-PCR was performed to assess gene expression levels of five androgen-induced genes. Gene expression levels are expressed relative to RPL19, an androgen-unresponsive gene. PP significantly suppressed gene expression in all cases, and augmented the effects of BiC, with one exception (TMPRSS2), which may have been maximally suppressed by each treatment alone. cntrl: untreated; BiC: bicalutamide; PP: pyrvinium pamoate; cast: castrated.\n\n\n \nFIG. 9\n.

Formulations for Inhibiting an Androgen Receptor\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention can be formulated in a variety of different manners known to one of skill in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are determined in part by the particular composition being administered, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition. Accordingly, there are a wide variety of suitable formulations of pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention (see, e.g., \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n20\nth \ned., 2003, supra). For example, the compounds of the present invention can be prepared and administered in a wide variety of oral, injectible and topical dosage forms. The compounds of the present invention can also be prepared and administered in parenteral dosage forms. Thus, the compounds of the present invention can be administered by injection, that is, intravenously, intramuscularly, intracutaneously, subcutaneously, intraduodenally, or intraperitoneally. Also, the compounds described herein can be administered by inhalation, for example, intranasally. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention can be administered transdermally or topically, e.g., in a liquid or gel form or as a patch.\n\n\nAccordingly, the present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and one or more compounds of the invention. In some embodiments, the compound can be any of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormulations suitable for administration can consist of (a) liquid solutions, such as an effective amount of a compound of the present invention suspended in diluents, such as water, saline or \nPEG\n 400; (b) capsules, sachets, depots or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as liquids, solids, granules or gelatin; (c) suspensions in an appropriate liquid; (d) suitable emulsions; and (e) patches. The pharmaceutical forms can include one or more of lactose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, calcium phosphates, corn starch, potato starch, microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, colloidal silicon dioxide, talc, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and other excipients, colorants, fillers, binders, diluents, buffering agents, moistening agents, preservatives, flavoring agents, dyes, disintegrating agents, and pharmaceutically compatible carriers.

In such form the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. The composition can, if desired, also contain other compatible therapeutic agents. Preferred pharmaceutical preparations can deliver the compounds of the invention in a sustained release formulation.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical preparations are typically delivered to a mammal, including humans and non-human mammals. Non-human mammals treated using the present methods include domesticated animals (i.e., canine, feline, murine, rodentia, and lagomorpha) and agricultural animals (bovine, equine, ovine, porcine).\n\n\nFor cancer therapy, formulations of the present invention can include a compound of Formula I or II in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-androgen or an LnRH agonist.

Additional therapeutic agents or diagnostic agents, such as those provided above, can also be formulated in combination with the combination of compounds of Formulas I and II.\n\n\nVI. Administration to Inhibit an Androgen Receptor\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention can be administered as frequently as necessary, including hourly, daily, weekly or monthly. The compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of the invention are administered at the initial dosage of about 0.0001 mg/kg to about 1000 mg/kg daily. A daily dose range of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg, or about 0.1 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg, or about 1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, or about 10 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, can be used. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being employed. For example, dosages can be empirically determined considering the type and stage of disease diagnosed in a particular patient. The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the administration of a particular compound in a particular patient. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day, if desired. Doses can be given daily, or on alternate days, as determined by the treating physician. Doses can also be given on a regular or continuous basis over longer periods of time (weeks, months or years), such as through the use of a subdermal capsule, sachet or depot, or via a patch.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be administered to the patient in a variety of ways, including topically, parenterally, intravenously, intradermally, intramuscularly, colonically, rectally or intraperitoneally. Preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered parenterally, topically, intravenously, intramuscularly or orally.\n\n\nIn practicing the methods of the present invention, the pharmaceutical compositions can be used alone, or in combination with other therapeutic or diagnostic agents. The additional anticancer drugs used in the combination protocols of the present invention can be administered separately or one or more of the anticancer drugs used in the combination protocols can be administered together, such as in an admixture. Where one or more anticancer drug is administered separately, the timing and schedule of administration of each drug can vary. The other therapeutic or diagnostic agents can be administered at the same time as the compounds of Formulas I or II, separately or at different times.\n\n\nThe compounds of Formula I can also be administered in combination with the compound of Formula II. Additional therapeutic agents or diagnostic agents can be administered in combination with the combination of Formulas I and II.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention can be administered with a course of hormonal therapy. The compound for hormonal therapy includes, but is not limited to, an anti-androgen and a LnRH agonist.\n\n\nIn clinical studies, number of lesions, tumor size, and tumor growth rate can be monitored by radiography, tomography, and, where possible, direct measurement of tumor mass. Anti-tumor effects can also be measured using molecular biology and biochemistry techniques, such as ELISA, PCR, western blotting, or immunocytochemistry.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutically effective amount of a composition required as a dose will depend on the route of administration, the type of cancer being treated, and the physical characteristics of the patient. The dose can be tailored to achieve a desired effect, but will depend on such factors as body surface area, weight, diet, concurrent medication and other factors which those skilled in the medical arts will recognize.\n\n\nThe foregoing are general guidelines only that can be expanded or altered based on, for example, disease type and grade, patient age, health status, and sex, the particular drugs used in combination, the route and frequency of administration, and experimental and clinical findings using a multidrug combination.\n\n\nVII.

The library consisted of 1040 FDA-approved drugs and natural products. A basic strategy to select and compare compounds from each of the primary screens was established (\nFIG. 1\n).\n\n\nThe transcription assay was conducted by transfecting 10 cm plates of HEK293 cells with plasmids encoding MMTV-luciferase, SV40-renilla luciferase, and native AR. These cells are useful because the limited transfection efficiency of prostate-derived cells increases the variability of the assay. The FRET assays were conducted using two independent cell lines, each stably expressing a CFP-AR-YFP fusion protein: HEK293/C-AR-Y and LAPC4/C-AR-Y. LAPC4 cells are a prostate derived line (Klein, K. A., et al., \nProgression of metastatic human prostate cancer to androgen independence in immunodeficient SCID mice\n. Nat Med, 1997. 3(4): p. 402-8). FRET is fluorescence resonance energy transfer between cyan and yellow fluorescent protein derivatives (CFP, YFP) that are fused to the amino and carboxyl termini of the human androgen receptor. When ligand activates the receptor, a conformational change takes place that brings the CFP and YFP into close proximity, thereby allowing FRET to occur. This spectroscopic change is detected using a fluorescence plate reader.\n\n\nFor the transcription assay, transfected cells were pooled before being plated into 96-well dishes with the test compounds at 10 μM. On each plate was included “no DHT” and “no treatment” controls, as well as a positive control with 1 μM OH-F. For the FRET assays, cells were directly plated into the 96-well plates with the test compounds at 10 μM. Cell and compound transfers were accomplished with a liquid handling robot. Cells were cultured for 24 hours in the presence of 10 nM DHT and the test compounds. After 24 hours, cells were either lysed by freeze-thaw (transcription assay), or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for reading on the FPR (FRET assays). Each compound was tested in duplicate in the initial screen.\n\n\nThe compounds were sorted on the basis of anti-androgen effects. In order to be selected for further analysis, a test compound had to function in both of the replicates, and in each case had to reduce the signal by at least one standard deviation from the mean of samples treated with DHT alone. This eliminated situations in which one test gave a strong response, and the replicate had none. Lastly, there must have been no evidence of cell toxicity, for the transcription assays specifically tested for renilla luciferase (which is discriminated from firefly luciferase on the basis of substrate specificity), and compounds that reduced this signal below two standard deviations were eliminated. For the FRET assays, toxic compounds were easily detected because of their effect on raw CFP and YFP signal, and compounds that reduced this signal below two standard deviations were eliminated.\n\n\nAnalysis of hits from the primary screen. \nFIG. 2\n illustrates the results of the screen. The data clearly indicate that each assay system was capable of sorting compounds according to efficacy. Hits were sorted using different stringencies to determine the degree of variance from the mean that would be required to select a limited number of hits for each assay. The conformational assay, when used in either HEK293 or LAPC4 cells, achieved high selectivity using a lower stringency, whereas the transcription-based assay required higher degrees of stringency to achieve the same selectivity. Accordingly, conformational assays are less sensitive to non-specific cellular perturbation, whereas many compounds were capable of perturbing the transcriptional response.\n\n\nThe top 50 compounds identified in each primary assay were then tested in the other two assays. Among the top hits in each assay that were not included for further analysis were all known anti-androgens from the library (hydroxy-flutamide, nilutamide, cyproterone, and cyproterone acetate), and certain steroid hormones that exhibit cross-reactivity with AR at micromolar concentrations. A Venn diagram illustrates that there was modest overlap between the primary assays: approximately 20-30% of hits that scored in one assay also scored in another assay (\nFIG. 3\n).\n\n\nTo determine “validated” hits, the top 50 compounds were re-tested with titration studies in the original assays in which they were detected, and selected only those that exhibited a classic dose-response pattern. When validated hits from each assay were compared for activity in the others, a much higher proportion of compounds (approximately 55-82%) scored positive in at least one other assay than in the primary screen. Few compounds (3) scored positive in all three assays. This is consistent with the idea that each screening approach has the potential to identify compounds with efficacy across assays, but that it also might add a new dimension to drug discovery. Importantly, among the small number of validated hits, it was discovered that one compound in the HEK293 FRET assay, and three compounds in the LAPC4 FRET assay that initially did not meet selection criteria in the HEK293 primary transcription assay, but which showed inhibition of AR-mediated transcription upon subsequent careful analysis. Accordingly, the FRET assays can augment drug discovery vs. transcription assays alone.\n\n\nIdentification of novel anti-androgens. Several lead compounds survived the stringent screening protocol, and three classes with previously unrecognized anti-androgen activity: the coumarins, including warfarin, scopoletin, and esculin; harmol hydrochloride, a natural product (HH); and an FDA-approved anti-helminthic, pyrvinium pamoate (PP).\n\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of pyrvinium and harmol against endogenous AR activity, each compound was tested in a dose-response assay in two prostate cancer-derived cell lines, LAPC4 (Klein, K. A., et al., \nProgression of metastatic human prostate cancer to androgen independence in immunodeficient SCID mice\n. Nat Med, 1997. 3(4): p. 402-8), and LNCaP (Horoszewicz, J. S., et al., \nThe LNCaP cell line—a new model for studies on human prostatic carcinoma\n. Prog Clin Biol Res, 1980. 37: p. 115-32) that each express endogenous AR. LAPC4 cells express wild-type AR, whereas LNCaP cells, which are derived from hormone-refractory PCa, express AR with a mutation (T877A) that renders it responsive to a variety of ligands, including the antagonist hydroxy-flutamide (OH-F). Cells were transfected with two reporter plasmids, a PSA-luciferase construct (androgen responsive), and an SV40-renilla luciferase construct as an internal control. The following day, the cells were split and drugs added in the presence of 3 nM DHT. Luciferase production was measured the following day (Dual luciferase assay kit, Promega).\n\n\nNo compounds had androgen activity in the absence of DHT in either the conformation or the transcription reporter assays, even at doses exceeding 10 μM. PP and HH were much more effective than the competitive antagonists OH-F and bicalutamide (BiC) at inhibiting reporter transcription (Table 1), so the anti-androgen characteristics of these compounds were studied further. Both PP and HH inhibited DHT-responsive gene expression with efficacies far superior to BiC (Table 1). To rule out the possibility that the pamoate salt of pyrvinium was mediating transcriptional inhibition, anion exchange (Dowex) was used to replace the pamoate with a chloride ion. Pyrvinium chloride was just as effective as pyrvinium pamoate (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 of various compounds identified in screens for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnovel anti-androgens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nActivity on\n\n\nActivity on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPSA-luciferase\n\n\nPSA-luciferase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n(nM)\n\n\nIC\n50\n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\n \nLNCaP\n \n \nLAPC4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPP\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n24\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHH\n\n\n127\n\n\n106\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOH-F\n\n\nagonist\n\n\n130\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCasodex\n\n\n585\n\n\n1,571\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEsculin\n\n\n62,159\n\n\n831\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nScopoletin\n\n\n603,586\n\n\n1,378\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWarfarin\n\n\n4,500\n\n\n1,954\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHarmine\n\n\n1,560\n\n\n80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHarmaline\n\n\n1,190\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHarman\n\n\n380\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNorharman\n\n\n2,500\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPP = pyrvinium pamoate;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHH = harmol hydrochloride;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOH-F = hydroxy-flutamide;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBiC = bicalutamide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nnd = no data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nAssay for Inhibition of an Androgen Receptor\n\n\nThe assay below demonstrates that the compounds identified in Example 2 inhibit endogenous androgen receptor gene expression and are not competitive antagonists.\n\n\nTo confirm that the effects of the lead compounds hold true for endogenous AR-regulated gene expression, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to monitor effects on a select number of androgen-responsive genes in LAPC4 and LNCaP cells.

KLK3, Nk×3.1, TMPRSS2, and FKBP51 were all induced by treatment with DHT, and this induction was inhibited to varying degrees by BiC, PP, and HH. Likewise, MMP-16 and RDC-1 were repressed by treatment with DHT, and the repression was lifted to varying degrees by all of the AR inhibitors. Table 2 summarizes the results from 3 or 4 separate qRT-PCR experiments in each cell type. Two genes known to be induced by DHT in LNCaPs, Nk×3.1 and TMPRSS2, were not significantly induced in LAPC4 cells.

As a first step to determine whether PP and HH function as competitive or noncompetitive antagonists of AR, DHT was titrated in LNCaP cells transiently transfected with a PSA-luciferase reporter, and treated with a moderate dose of each inhibitor. DHT overcame the inhibitory effect of OH-F, producing maximal activation. By contrast, both PP and HH inhibited maximal DHT-induced activation, despite very high final DHT concentrations (\nFIG. 5\n). This was consistent with activity as non-competitive antagonists.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nSynergistic Behavior of PP, HH and BiC\n\n\nThe presence of synergy in the use of PP, HH and BiC as androgen receptor antagonists is confirmed using the procedure below.\n\n\nThe existence of synergy between the lead compounds and BiC was tested for using LAPC4 and LNCaP cells. When added in various combinations to LNCaP and LAPC4 cells transfected with the PSA-luciferase, both PP and HH synergized with each other, and with BiC (Table 3). Synergism can be defined as a combination index of less than one, using the non-exclusive assumption described by Chou et al. (Chou, T. C. and P. Talalay, \nQuantitative analysis of dose\n-\neffect relationships: the combined effects of multiple drugs or enzyme inhibitors\n. Adv Enzyme Regul, 1984. 22: p. 27-55). The synergy between PP, HH, and BiC is indicates that they function by distinct mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynergy between PP, HH and BiC.

D., et al., \nMolecular determinants of resistance to antiandrogen therapy\n. Nat Med, 2004. 10(1): p. 33-9). HEK293 cells were used as a control. Cells were transferred to charcoal-stripped media two days before they were split and plated in quadruplicate at a density of approximately 20,000 cells/well in 48-well plates. The following day, medium with or without 3 nM DHT was added to the cells with or without PP (100 nM), HH (100 nM), or BiC (1 μM). Media were changed every day, using a single preparation to ensure consistent compound concentrations. Proliferation was determined by measuring the DNA content of the cells in each well. Each day, the cells in four wells were fixed in 100% cold methanol, followed by staining for 5 min at RT with 0.2 ng/\nmL\n 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS. The cells were washed once in PBS, then read on a fluorescence plate reader using 365/439 excitation/emission wavelengths. LAPC4 and LNCaP cells proliferated to a much greater degree in the presence of DHT, while LN-AR cells proliferated in the presence and absence of DHT. PP was the only compound able to inhibit the growth of all four cell lines after seven days, while HH and BiC only inhibited significantly the growth of LNCaP cells. Control HEK293 cells were not significantly affected by any of the compounds, suggesting that none of them has non-specific growth-inhibitory effects. PP and HH worked at least as well as BiC to block androgen-induced proliferation (\nFIG. 6\n).\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nPharmacokinetics and Toxicity of Compounds in Mice\n\n\nAnti-androgen activity of PP and HH in mice were determined using the procedure set forth below.\n\n\nWild-type FVB mice were given a single intraperitoneal injection of either PP or HH. Serum samples were obtained at fixed time intervals, and the drug levels determined by mass spectrometry. These results indicated that HH was rapidly cleared. PP exhibited a prolonged half-life indicating that it could be a suitable therapy (Table 4). Toxicity of PP was tested using various doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. 10 mg/kg was toxic, while the mice tolerated 5 mg/kg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacokinetics of PP vs. HH.

As a positive control, one cohort was castrated four weeks prior to tissue recovery, one cohort was untreated, and the other cohorts were treated either with 1 mg/kg PP, 100 mg/kg BiC, or PP/BiC in combination. Animals were treated 5 times per week for four weeks. At the end of the study period, animals were sacrificed and prostate tissue weighed. After weighing, the tissue was divided in half for pathological and genetic studies. BiC treatment decreased prostate tissue size by 35% (p<0.003). Treatment with PP:BiC caused a further reduction by 63% that was highly significant vs. the effect of BiC alone (P<0.0005). PP alone did not produce a statistically significant effect. (\nFIG. 7\n).\n\n\nPP synergizes with BiC in vivo to inhibit androgen-dependent prostate gene expression. To evaluate the effect of PP and PP:BiC on androgen-dependent gene expression in the prostate, total RNA was prepared from half of the prostate glands isolated in the in vivo trial. RT-PCR was carried out, and gene expression was determined relative to RPL19, an endogenous prostate gene that is completely androgen unresponsive (E. Bolton, K. R. Yamamoto: unpublished data). Five androgen-responsive genes that are expressed throughout all lobes of the mouse prostate were evaluated. In each case, it was observed that PP and BiC reduced gene expression significantly, but their combination was superior. In most cases, the combination approached that of castrated animals (\nFIG. 8\n). Taken together with the preceding experiment, PP exerts anti-androgen effects, and synergy with BiC as an anti-androgen in vivo.\n\n\nAlthough the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, one of skill in the art will appreciate that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims.

The need and choice of protecting groups for a particular reaction is known to those skilled in the art and depends on the nature of the functional group to be protected (hydroxyl group, amino group, etc.), the structure and stability of the molecule of which the substituent is a part and the reaction conditions.\n\n\nWell known protecting groups that meet these conditions and their introduction and removal are described, for example, in McOmie, “\nProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\n”, Plenum Press, London, N.Y. (1973); and Greene and Wuts, “\nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\n”, John Wiley and Sons, Inc, New York (1999).\n\n\nThe above mentioned reactions are carried out according to standard methods, in the presence or absence of diluent, preferably such as are inert to the reagents and are solvents thereof, of catalysts, condensing or said other agents respectively and/or inert atmospheres, at low temperatures, room temperature or elevated temperatures (preferably at or near the boiling point of the solvents used), and at atmospheric or super-atmospheric pressure. The preferred solvents, catalysts and reaction conditions are set forth in the appended illustrative Examples.\n\n\nThe invention further includes any variant of the present processes, in which an intermediate product obtainable at any stage thereof is used as starting material and the remaining steps are carried out, or in which the starting materials are formed in situ under the reaction conditions, or in which the reaction components are used in the form of their salts or optically pure antipodes.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention and intermediates can also be converted into each other according to methods generally known per se.\n\n\nThe invention also relates to any novel starting materials, intermediates and processes for their manufacture.\n\n\nDepending on the choice of starting materials and methods, the new compounds may be in the form of one of the possible isomers or mixtures thereof, for example, as substantially pure geometric (cis or trans) isomers, optical isomers (enantiomers, antipodes), racemates, or mixtures thereof. The aforesaid possible isomers or mixtures thereof are within the purview of this invention.\n\n\nAny resulting mixtures of isomers can be separated on the basis of the physico-chemical differences of the constituents, into the pure geometric or optical isomers, diastereoisomers, racemates, for example by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization.\n\n\nAny resulting racemates of final products or intermediates can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, e.g. by separation of the diastereoisomeric salts thereof, obtained with an optically active acid or base, and liberating the optically active acidic or basic compound. The carboxylic acid intermediates can thus be resolved into their optical antipodes e.g. by fractional crystallization of D- or L-(alpha-methylbenzylamine, cinchonidine, cinchonine, quinine, quinidine, ephedrine, dehydroabietylamine, brucine or strychnine)-salts. Racemic products can also be resolved by chiral chromatography, e.g. high pressure liquid chromatography using a chiral adsorbent.\n\n\nFinally, compounds of the invention are either obtained in the free form, as a salt thereof if salt forming groups are present or as prodrug derivatives thereof.\n\n\nIn particular, the NH-group of the 1,1-dioxo-1,2,5-thiadiazolidin-3-one moiety, may be converted into salts with pharmaceutically acceptable bases. Salts may be formed using conventional methods, advantageously in the presence of an ethereal or alcoholic solvent, such as a lower alkanol. From the solutions of the latter, the salts may be precipitated with ethers, e.g. diethyl ether. Resulting salts may be converted into the free compounds by treatment with acids. These or other salts can also be used for purification of the compounds obtained.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention having basic groups can be converted into acid addition salts, especially pharmaceutically acceptable salts. These are formed, for example, with inorganic acids, such as mineral acids, for example sulfuric acid, a phosphoric or hydrohalic acid, or with organic carboxylic acids, such as (C\n1-4\n)alkanecarboxylic acids which, for example, are unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, for example acetic acid, such as saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, succinic, maleic or fumaric acid, such as hydroxy-carboxylic acids, for example glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid, such as amino acids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid, or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C\n1-4\n)alkyl-sulfonic acids (for example methanesulfonic acid) or arylsulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example by halogen). Preferred are salts formed with hydrochloric acid, methanesulfonic acid and maleic acid.\n\n\nProdrug derivatives of any compound of the present invention are derivatives of said compounds which following administration release the parent compound in vivo via some chemical or physiological process, e.g., a prodrug on being brought to the physiological pH or through enzyme action is converted to the parent compound. Exemplary prodrug derivatives are, e.g., esters of free carboxylic acids and S-acyl and O-acyl derivatives of thiols, alcohols or phenols, wherein acyl has a meaning as defined herein. Preferred are pharmaceutically acceptable ester derivatives convertible by solvolysis under physiological conditions to the parent carboxylic acid, e.g., lower alkyl esters, cycloalkyl esters, lower alkenyl esters, benzyl esters, mono- or di-substituted lower alkyl esters, such as the ω-(amino, mono- or di-lower alkylamino, carboxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl)-lower alkyl esters, the α-(lower alkanoyloxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl or di-lower alkylaminocarbonyl)-lower alkyl esters, such as the pivaloyloxymethyl ester and the like conventionally used in the art.\n\n\nIn view of the close relationship between the free compounds, the prodrug derivatives and the compounds in the form of their salts, whenever a compound is referred to in this context, a prodrug-derivative and a corresponding salt is also intended, provided such is possible or appropriate under the circumstances.\n\n\nThe compounds, including their salts, can also be obtained in the form of their hydrates, or include other solvents used for their crystallization.\n\n\nAs described herein above, the compounds of the present invention are inhibitors of PTPases and, thus, may be employed for the treatment of conditions mediated by the PTPases.

A therapeutically effective amount in vivo may range depending on the route of administration, between about 0.1 and 500 mg/kg or between about 1 and 500 mg/kg, preferably between about 5 and 100 mg/kg.\n\n\nThe activity of a compound according to the invention may be assessed by the following methods or by following methods well described in the art (e.g. Peters G. et al. \nJ. Biol. Chem, \n2000, 275, 18201-09).\n\n\nFor example, the PTP-1B inhibitory activity in vitro may be determined as follows:\n\n\nAssessment of human PTP-1B (hPTP-1B) activity in the presence of various agents is determined by measuring the amount of inorganic phosphate released from a phosphopeptide substrate using a 96-well microtiter plate format. The assay (100 μL) is performed in an assay buffer comprised of 50 mM TRIS (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM DTT at ambient temperature. The assay is typically performed in the presence of 0.4% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). However, concentrations as high as 10% are used with certain poorly soluble compounds. A typical reaction is initiated by the addition of 0.4 pmoles of hPTP-1B (amino acids 1-411) to wells containing assay buffer, 3 nmoles of the synthetic phosphopeptide substrate (GNGDp YMPMSPKS), and the test compound. After 10 min, 180 μL malachite green reagent (0.88 mM malachite green, 8.2 mM ammonium molybdate, aqueous 1 N HCl, and 0.01% Triton X-100) is added to terminate the reaction. Inorganic phosphate, a product of the enzyme reaction, is quantitiated after 15 min as the green color resulting from complexing with the Malichite reagent and is determined as an A\n620 \nusing a Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, Calif.) SpectraMAX Plus spectrophotometer. Test compounds are solubilized in 100% DMSO (Sigma, D-8779) and diluted in DMSO. Activity is defined as the net change in absorbance resulting from the activity of the uninhibited hPTP-1B\n[1-411]\n minus that of a tube with acid-inactivated hPTP-1B\n[1-411]\n.\n\n\nThe hPTP-1B\n[1-411]\n is cloned by PCR from a human hippocampal cDNA library (Clonetech) and inserted into a pET 19-b vector (Novagen) at the Nco1 restriction site. \nE. coli \nstrain BL21 (DE3) is transformed with this clone and stored as a stock culture in 20% glycerol at −80° C. For enzyme production, a stock culture is inoculated into Lb/Amp and grown at 37° C. Expression of PTP-1B is initiated by induction with 1 mM IPTG after the culture had reached an OD\n600\n=0.6. After 4 h, the bacterial pellet is collected by centrifugation. Cells are resuspended in 70 mL lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH7.6), incubated on ice for 30 min then sonicated (4×10 sec bursts at full power). The lysate is centrifuged at 100,000×g for 60 min and the supernatant is buffer exchanged and purified on a cation exchange POROS 20SP column followed by an anion exchange Source 30Q (Pharmacia) column, using linear NaCl gradient elutions. Enzyme is pooled, adjusted to 1 mg/mL and frozen at −80° C.\n\n\nAlternatively, the assessment of human PTP-1B activity in the presence of various agents may be determined by measuring the hydrolysis products of known competing substrates. For example, cleavage of substrate para-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) results in the release of the yellow-colored para-nitrophenol (pNP) which can be monitored in real time using a spectrophotometer. Likewise, the hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate ammonium salt (DiFMUP) results in the release of the fluorescent DiFMU which can be readily followed in a continuous mode with a fluorescence reader (Anal. Biochem. 273, 41, 1999; Anal. Biochem. 338, 32, 2005):\n\n\npNPP Assay\n\n\nCompounds were incubated with 1 nM recombinant human PTP-1B\n[1-298]\n or PTP-1B\n[1-322]\n in buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM DTT, 0.05% NP-40 for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction is initiated by the addition of pNPP (2 mM final concentration) and run for 120 min at room temperature. Reactions are quenched with 5 N NaOH. Absorbance at 405 nm is measured using any standard 384 well plate reader.\n\n\nDiFMUP Assay\n\n\nCompounds are incubated with 1 nM recombinant human PTP-1B\n[1-298]\n or PTP-1B\n[1-322]\n in buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM DTT, 0.05% NP-40 (or 0.001% BSA) for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction is initiated by the addition of DiFMUP (6 μM final concentration) and run kinetically on fluorescence plate reader at 355 nm excitation and 460 nm emission wavelengths. Reaction rates over 15 min are used to calculate inhibition.\n\n\nPTP-1B\n[1-298]\n is expressed in \nE. coli \nBL21 (DE3) containing plasmids constructed using pET19b vectors (Novagen). The bacteria is grown in minimal media using an “On Demand” Fed-batch strategy. Typically, a 5.5 liter fermentation is initiated in Fed-batch mode and grown overnight unattended at 37° C. Optical densities varied between 20-24OD\n600 \nand the cultures are induced at 30° C. with IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The bacterial cells are harvested 8 hours later and yield 200-350 gm (wet weight). The cells are frozen as pellets and stored at −80° C. until use. All steps are performed at 4° C. unless noted. Cells (˜15 g) are thawed briefly at 37° C. and resuspended in 50 mL of lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, pH 8.0 containing one tablet of Complete (EDTA-free) protease cocktail (Boehringer Mannheim), 100 μM PMSF and 100 μg/mL DNase I. The cells are lysed by sonication (4×10 second burst, full power) using a Virsonic 60 (Virtus). The pellet is collected at 35,000×g, resuspended in 25 mL of lysis buffer using a Polytron and collected as before. The two supernatants are combined and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000×g. The soluble lysate could be stored at this stage at −80° C. or used for further purification. Diafiltration using a 10 kD MWCO membrane is used to buffer exchange the protein and reduce the NaCl concentration prior to cation exchange chromatography. Diafiltration buffer contained 50 mM MES, 75 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, pH 6.5. Soluble supernatant is then loaded onto a POROS 20 SP (1×10 cm) column equilibrated with cation exchange buffer (50 mM MES and 75 mM NaCl, pH 6.5) at a rate of 20 mL/min. An analytical column (4.6×100 mm) is run in a similar fashion except the flow rate was reduced to 10 mL/min. Protein is eluted from the column using a linear salt gradient (75-500 mm NaCl in 25 CV). Fractions containing PTP-1B\n[1-298]\n are identified and pooled according to SDS-PAGE analyses. Final purification is performed using Sephacryl S-100 HR (Pharmacia). The column (2.6×35 cm) is equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM DTT, pH 7.5 and run at a flow rate of 2 mL/min. The final protein is pooled and concentrated to ˜5 mg/mL using an Ultrafree-15 concentrator (Millipore) with a MWCO 10,000. The concentrated protein is stored at −80° C. until use.\n\n\nCompetitive binding to the active site of the enzyme can be determined as follows:\n\n\nLigand binding is detected by acquiring \n1\nH-\n15\nN HSQC spectra on 250 μL of 0.15 mM PTP-1B\n[1-298]\n in the presence and absence of added compound (1-2 mM). The binding is determined by the observation of \n15\nN- or \n1\nH-amide chemical shift changes in two dimensional HSQC spectra upon the addition of a compound to \n15\nN-label protein. Because of the \n15\nN spectral editing, no signal from the ligand is observed, only protein signals. Thus, binding can be detected at high compound concentrations. Compounds which caused a pattern of chemical shift changes similar to the changes seen with known active site binders are considered positive.\n\n\nAll proteins are expressed in \nE. coli \nBL21 (DE3) containing plasmids constructed using pET19b vectors (Novagen). Uniformly \n15\nN-labeled PTP-1B\n1-298 \nis produced by growth of bacteria on minimal media containing \n15\nN-labeled ammonium chloride. All purification steps are performed at 4° C. Cells (˜15 g) are thawed briefly at 37° C. and resuspended in 50 mL of lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, pH 8.0 containing one tablet of Complete (EDTA-free) protease cocktail (Boehringer Mannheim), 100 μM PMSF and 100 μg/mL DNase I. The cells are lysed by sonication. The pellet is collected at 35,000×g, resuspended in 25 mL of lysis buffer using a Polytron and collected as before. The two supernatants are combined and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000×g. Diafiltration using a 10 kD MWCO membrane is used to buffer exchange the protein and reduce the NaCl concentration prior to cation exchange chromatography. Diafiltration buffer contained 50 mM MES, 75 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, pH 6.5. Soluble supernatant is then loaded onto a POROS 20 SP (1×10 cm) column equilibrated with cation exchange buffer (50 mM MES and 75 mM NaCl, pH 6.5) at a rate of 20 mL/min. Protein is eluted from the column using a linear salt gradient (75-500 mM NaCl in 25 CV). Fractions containing PTP-1B's are identified and pooled according to SDS-PAGE analyses. PTP-1B\n1-298 \nis further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a POROS 20 HQ column (1×10 cm). The pool from cation exchange chromatography is concentrated and buffer exchanged in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 75 mM NaCl and 5 mM DTT. Protein is loaded onto column at 20 mL/min and eluted using a linear NaCl gradient (75-500 mM in 25 CV). Final purification is performed using Sephacryl S-100 HR (Pharmacia) (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM DTT, pH 7.5). The NMR samples are composed of uniformly \n15\nN-labeled PTP-1B\n1-298 \n(0.15 mM) and inhibitor (1-2 mM) in a 10% D\n2\nO/90% H\n2\nO Bis-Tris -d\n19 \nbuffer (50 mM, pH=6.5) solution containing NaCl (50 mM), DL-1,4-Dithiothreitol-d\n10 \n(5 mM) and Sodium azide (0.02%).\n\n\nThe \n1\nH-\n15\nN HSQC NMR spectra are recorded at 20° C., on Bruker DRX500 or DMX600 NMR spectrometers. In all. NMR experiments, pulsed field gradients are applied to afford the suppression of solvent signal.

No. 60/853,655, filed Oct. 23, 2006 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/923,337, filed Apr. 13, 2007.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIntracellular receptors (IR's) are a class of structurally related proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression. The steroid hormone receptors are a subset of this superfamily whose natural ligands are typically comprised of endogenous steroids such as estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol. Man-made ligands to these receptors play an important role in human health and, of these receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor has an essential role in regulating human physiology and immune response. Steroids that interact with the glucocorticoid receptor have been shown to be potent anti-inflammatory agents, although cross-reactivity with other steroid hormone receptors such as the mineralocorticoid, progesterone and androgen receptors can lead to problematic ancillary pharmacology.\n\n\nThe dissociation of transactivation from transrepression at the glucocorticoid receptor is believed to be an approach toward improving the side-effect profile related to steroid therapy. The beneficial anti-inflammatory activity of GR modulators, such as steroids, is believed to occur through the transrepression of genes encoding for proinflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules and enzymes. Many of the undesirable side-effects associated with such agents are believed to occur through the transactivation, or induction, of gene transcription leading to the downstream perturbation of homeostatic endocrine function. Some of these affected metabolic processes include induced gluconeogenesis, induced amino acid degradation, osteoporosis, suppression of HPA axis, induction of secondary adrenal suppression, changes in electrolyte concentration, changes in lipid metabolism, growth retardation, impaired wound healing and skin thinning. Weak, partial and full agonism of GR related to transrepression and transactivation, including potential antagonism of the receptor regarding transactivation, may be applied to the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma.

J.; Elmore, S. W.; Kym, P. R.; Kort, M. E. \nIn Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry\n; Doherty, A. M., Hagmann, W. K., Eds.; Academic Press: San Diego, Calif., USA, 2002; Vol. 37, Ch. 17, pp 167-176.\n\n\nGlucocorticoid receptor modulators are described in WO 2003/061651, WO2003/086294, WO2004/026248, WO2004/075840 and WO2004093805. An object of the invention is the discovery of novel compounds that modulate the glucocorticoid receptor. Another object of the invention is the discovery of novel glucocorticoid receptor modulators with superior transactivation and transrepression activity profiles. It is believed that such compounds would have potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity and possess advantages over current steroid therapies with respect to side effects, efficacy, toxicity and/or metabolism.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is directed to 2-[1-phenyl-5-hydroxy or methoxy-4alpha-methyl-hexahydrocyclopenta[f]indazol-5-yl]ethyl phenyl derivatives as glucocorticoid receptor ligands useful for treating a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases or conditions.

After aging at 5-10° C. for 3 h, >95% conversion is typically observed, at which point a solution of AcOH in THF (25 mL) is added slowly over 10 min, while maintaining the temperature below 25° C. During this addition, solids form almost immediately and the batch thickens momentarily but becomes more fluid with stirring. At the end of AcOH quench, 25 mL of MeOH is then added, followed by p-F phenylhydrazine HCl salt as a solid. The reaction mixture is then heated to 60° C., aged for 1 h to give a full conversion, diluted with MTBE (110 mL) and washed with 10% aqueous NaCl (110 mL). The organic layer is separated and washed one more time with 10% aqueous NaCl (100 mL). Removal of the TMS group is carried out by first diluting the organic layer with 23 mL of MeOH and 23 mL of H\n2\nO, followed by 42 mL of 10M NaOH to bring the pH to >13. After aging at 35-50° C. for 1-2 h, the reaction is found complete and the batch is cooled to 25° C., washed with 110 mL of 10% aqueous brine and the organic layer is washed one more time with 170 mL of 10% aqueous brine. The organic layer is then dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4 \n(20 g) overnight, filtered and then batch concentrated under vacuum to minimum volume (about 30 mL) using 160-200 mL of acetonitrile. Product crystallized out at this point and to this slurry is added 40 mL MTBE and then 450 L heptane over 30 min at. 23° C. After stirring for 35 min, reaction mixture is then concentrated under vacuum to remove about 20 mL of solvent. The batch is then stirred for 45 min, filtered and the wet cake is washed with 20 mL of 2:1 MTBE:heptane and air dried. The product is obtained as a brown solid in 9.1 grams (70%).\n\n\n3.

E., et al., \nEuropean Journal of Cancer, \n30A: 484-490 (1994)) HeLa (ATCC) cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco 11835-055) containing 20 mM Hepes, 4 mM L-glu, 10 ug/ml of human insulin (Sigma, I-0259), 10% FBS and 20 ug/ml of Gentamicin (Gibco #15710-072) are rinsed twice in PBS. Phenol red-free Trypsin-EDTA is diluted in the same PBS 1:10. The cell layers are rinsed with 1× Trypsin, extra Trypsin is poured out, and the cell layers are incubated at 37° C. for ˜2 min. The flask is tapped and checked for signs of cell detachment. Once the cells begin to slide off the flask, the complete media is added. The cells are counted at this point, then diluted to the appropriate concentration and split into flasks or dishes for further culturing (Usually 1:3 to 1:6 dilution).\n\n\nPreparation of Hela Cell Lysate\n\n\nWhen the cells are 70 to 85% confluent, they are detached as described above, and collected by centrifuging at 1000 g for 10 minutes at 4° C. The cell pellet is washed twice with TEGM (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM Sodium Molybdate, pH 7.2). After the final wash, the cells are resuspended in TEGM at a concentration of 10\n7 \ncells/mL. The cell suspension is snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or ethanol/dry ice bath and transferred to −80° C. freezer on dry ice. Before setting up the binding assay, the frozen samples are left on ice-water to just thaw (˜1 hr). Then the samples are centrifuged at 12,500 g to 20,000 g for 30 min at 4° C. The supernatant is used to set-up assay right away. If using 50 μL of supernatant, the test compound can be prepared in 50 μL of the TEGM buffer.\n\n\nProcedure for Multiple Compound Screening\n\n\n1×TEGM buffer is prepared, and the isotope-containing assay mixture is prepared in the following order: EtOH (2% final concentration in reaction), 3H-DEX (Amersham Biosciences) and 1×TEGM. [e.g. For 100 samples, 200 μL (100×2) of EtOH+4.25 μL of 1:10 \n3\nH-Dex stock+2300 μL (100×23) 1×TEGM]. The compound is serially diluted, e.g., if starting final conc. is 1 μM, and the compound is in 25 μL of solution, for duplicate samples, 75 μL of 4×1 μM solution is made and 3 μL of 100 μM is added to 72 μL of buffer, and 1:5 serial dilution.\n\n\n25 μL of \n3\nH-DEX (6 nM) trace and 25 μL compound solution are first mixed together, followed by addition of 50 μL receptor solution. The reaction is gently mixed, spun briefly at about 200 rpm and incubated at 4° C. overnight. 100 μL of 50% HAP slurry is prepared and added to the incubated reaction which is then vortexed and incubated on ice for 5 to 10 minutes. The reaction mixture is vortexed twice more to resuspend HAP while incubating reaction. The samples in 96-well format are then washed in wash buffer using The FilterMate™ Universal Harvester plate washer (Packard). The washing process transfers HAP pellet containing ligand-bound expressed receptor to Unifilter-96 GF/B filter plate (Packard). The HAP pellet on the filter plate is incubated with 50 μL of MICROSCINT (Packard) scintillant for 30 minutes before being counted on the TopCount microscintillation counter (Packard). IC\n50\ns are calculated using DEX as a reference.\n\n\nExamples 1 to 201 were tested in the ligand binding assay and demonstrated IC50s less than 1000 nM.\n\n\nTrans-Activation Modulation of Glucocorticoid Receptor (GRAMMER)\n\n\nThis assay assesses the ability of test compounds to control transcription from the MMTV-LUC reporter gene in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells or HeLa cells, a human breast cancer cell line that naturally expresses the human GR. The assay measures induction of a modified MMTV LTR/promoter linked to the LUC reporter gene.\n\n\nThe routine transient assay consists of plating 7,000-25,000 cells/well of a white, clear-bottom 96-well plate. Alternatively, 384-well plates can be used at a cell concentration of 10,000/well. The media that the cells are plated in is “exponential growth medium” which consists of phenol red-free RPMI1640 containing 10% FBS, 4 mM L-glutamine, 20 mM HEPES, 10 ug/mL human insulin, and 20 ug/mL gentamicin. Incubator conditions are 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. The transfection is done in batch mode. The cells are trypsinized and counted to the right cell number in the proper amount of fresh media. It is then gently mixed with the FuGene6/DNA mix and plated onto the 96 or 384-well plate, all the wells receive 100 uL or 40 uL, respectively, of medium+lipid/DNA complex then incubated 37° C. overnight. The transfection cocktail consists of serum-free OptiMEM, FuGene6 reagent and DNA. The manufacturer's (Roche Biochemical) protocol for cocktail setup is as follows: The lipid to DNA ratio is approximately 2.5:1 and the incubation time is 20 min at room temperature. Sixteen to 24 hours after transfection, the cells are treated with dexamethasone to a final concentration of 10 nM as well as the compound of interest, such that final DMSO (vehicle) concentration is equal to or less than 1%. Each plate also contains samples that are treated with 10 nM dexamethasone alone, which is used as the 100% activity control. The cells are exposed to the compounds for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the cells are lysed by a Promega cell culture lysis buffer for approximately 30 min and then the luciferase activity in the extracts is assayed in the 96-well format luminometer. In 384-well format, Steady-Glo (Promega) or Steady-Lite (PerkinElmer) can be used by adding an equal volume of reagent to the media present in each well. Activity induced by 10 nM dexamethasone alone is set at 100% activity. Antagonist activity is calculated by determining the decrease in dexamethasone-induced activity in response to compound treatment relative to samples that were treated with dexamethasone alone. Results are expressed as % inhibition of 10 nM dexamethasone activity or as fold of 10 nM dexamethasone activity. This transactivation assay can be performed in an agonist and antagonist mode to identify these different activities.\n\n\nActivity of test compounds is calculated as the E\nmax \nrelative to the activity obtained with 300 nM dexamethasone. Activity of test compounds is calculated as the E\nmax \nrelative to the activity obtained with 300 nM DEX. The exemplified tissue selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators of the present invention display agonist activity in this assay of greater than 5% and less than 100%, and maximal transactivation activity less then maximal transrepression activity.\n\n\nThe action of compounds is also tested in an antagonist mode (Anti-GRAMMER) in which the cells are treated with medium containing an agonist such as 10 nM DEX and the ability of agents to inhibit the activation by an agonist is measured.\n\n\nTransrepression Assay (GITAR)\n\n\nThis assay assesses the ability of test compounds to control transcription from the TNFα-β-lactamase reporter gene in U937 cells, a human myelomonocytic leukemia cell line that naturally expresses the human GR. The assay measures compound dependent-repression of the TNFa promoter linked to a reporter gene.\n\n\nThe human U937 cells that had been stably transfected with the TNF-α promoter driving β-lactamase are used for this assay. U937 cells contain an endogenous glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Cells are maintained in RPMI 1640 Growth medium (Gibco Cat#11875-093) containing 25 mM HEPES, 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM Sodium pyruvate, 25 μg/ml Gentamicin (Gibco Cat#15710-064), 1:1000 2-Mercaptoethanol (Gibco Cat#21985-023) and 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Gibco Cat#10131-027). The density of the cells in the flask needs to be about 1×106-3×106/ml at the time of harvest. Usually, the cells are split to 1.2˜1.4×105/ml (1:10) 3 days prior to the assay. 50,000 cells/well are plated in 96 well black-walled plates the day of assay. Test compounds are added 10 μL/well, and cells are incubated at 37° C. for 30˜45 min. For assaying compounds, first dilute 1:10 in DMSO to make 1 mM, then further dilute 1:100 in medium to make 10× stock prior to adding to the cells. Add 50 ng/ml PMA (Sigma, cat# P8139) 10 μL/well to a final concentration 5 ng/ml, and 1 μg/ml LPS (Sigma, cat# L4130) 10 μL/well to a final concentration 100 ng/ml. Incubate cells at 370 C overnight for ˜18 hr. PMA is stored frozen as 100 μg/ml stock in DMSO. Dilute 1:10 in DMSO for a working stock of 10 μg/ml and store at −20 C. For assaying, dilute the 10 μg/ml working stock 1:200 in medium to make a 10× solution (50 ng/ml). Store frozen LPS at 1 mg/ml in PBS, dilute 1:1000 in medium to make 10× (1 μg/ml) for the assay. Add 6× loading buffer (CCF2-AM) 20 μL/well, and incubate at room temperature for 70˜90 min. Read plates on CytoFluor II Plate Reader according to manufacture suggested protocols. The activity repressed by 100 nM dexamethasone alone is set as 100% activity.\n\n\nExamples 1 to 201 were tested in the transrepression assay and demonstrated maximal activity greater than 5% and less than 100% and maximal transactivation activity less then maximal transrepression activity.\n\n\nMicroarray Analysis\n\n\nThis assay assesses the ability of test compounds to modulate the transcription of endogenously expressed genes in a variety of cell types including but not limited to A549, HeLa or U937 cells. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen Life Tech, Carlsbad Calif. A549 cells were grown in phenol red-free DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were grown at 37° C. with 5% CO2. Using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen Corp, Valencia Calif.), total RNA was extracted and purified from A549 cells treated with different GC compounds for 24 hours, at a fully active dose. These cells express large amount of the GR and are very responsive to GC treatment. All samples were compared against cells treated with vehicle. Expression levels of 23000 genes were measured using oligonucleotide microarrays purchased from Agilent Technologies, Inc. Each comparison was done on a pair of microarrays with reversed fluorophores. Raw image intensity data were processed according to the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,351,712. The method was used to remove dye bias and to derive a Rosetta probability (p) and fold change value for each gene and each sample pair. Furthermore, for each gene an ANOVA model was constructed across all treatments to derive error estimates. P values for evaluating expression differences were computed using a Bayesian adjusted t-test that was developed by Lönnstedt and Speed (2002) and extended by Smyth (2003). A gene was declared differentially expressed in any particular comparison if it satisfied two criteria:\n\n\n1. The Rosetta p value had to be less than 0.1 and the Rosetta fold change value had to be greater than 1.4 in at least one of the treatments.\n\n\n2. The ANOVA p value had to be less than 0.01 and the fold change greater than 2 in the comparison under consideration.\n\n\nIn Vivo Inflammation Assay\n\n\nIntact adult (6 month old) female Sprague-Dawley rats are used in the oxazolone (OX) contact dermatitis model. Rats were sensitized on the ventral abdomen with OX on Day 0. On Days 7 and 9, a randomly-selected ear was challenged (same ear each time) with OX; the other was treated with vehicle. Daily treatment begun on Day 7 and continued for 7d with test compounds at different doses and 1.3 mpk 6-methylprednisolone or 0.1 mpk DEX as positive controls. The thickness of both ears are measured on Days 11 and 14. Necropsy occurred on Day 14. The rat is first weighed, then anesthetized in a CO\n2 \nchamber until near death. Approximately 5 ml whole blood is obtained by cardiac puncture. The rat is then examined for certain signs of death and completeness. Tissues are dissected in a highly stylized fashion. The following endpoints were evaluated: a) inhibiting ear inflammation induced by oxazolone, b) raising serum insulin, c) reducing serum ACTH, d) reducing spleen weight, e) reducing skin thickness, f) reducing body weight, g) increasing expression of bone-related genes with potential relationship to negative glucocorticoid effects on bone; e) changes in molecular markers that correlate with skin inflammation, skin thinning, muscle atrophy and glucose metabolism in liver. All blood samples were collected between 1330-1530 hours, ˜4-5 hrs after the last compound treatment.\n\n\nPrimary data for this assay are left and right ear thickness. Inter-ear thickness difference (etd) is used for the estimating the level of inflammation and effectiveness of the compounds is determined by their ability to reduce the increase the thickness of the inflamed ear. Back of the rat skin thickness, spleen weight, serum insulin as well as the effects of gcs on the expression of molecular markers in skin inflammation, skin atrophy, muscle atrophy and glucose metabolism in liver are measured. Data are analyzed by anova plus fisher plsd post-hoc test to identify intergroup differences.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nAs stated above, Examples 1 to 201 demonstrated IC50s less than 1000 nM in the ligand binding assay, maximal activity greater than 5% and less than 100% in the transrepression assay and maximal transactivation activity less then maximal transrepression activity. A subset of compounds has been discovered having a superior activity profile as shown in Table 1 below. The compounds shown in Table 1 have potencies in the GRAMMER and GITAR assays (as measured by inflection points, IP) of less than 300 nM concomitant with maximum activity in the GRAMMER assay of less than 60% and maximum activity in the GITAR assay of between 40 and 80%. The examples not shown in Table 1 had activity profiles outside this criterion.\n\n\nCompounds in the range of activities described above offer potential improvements over fuller agonists (higher Emaxes) as they may have less side effects as demonstrated in preclinical models. Among the compounds with the described range of activities, different selectivity profiles may be observed in different animal models, which model the side effects of diabetes and glucose intolerance, skin and muscle atrophy, intraocular pressure, bone degradation, and hypertension. Compounds shown in Table 1 have demonstrated, or have the potential for such selectivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n

Field of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to agonists of muscarinic receptors. The present invention also provides compositions comprising such agonists, and methods therewith for treating muscarinic receptor mediated diseases. Particularly, the present invention is related to compounds that may be effective in treating pain, Alzheimer's disease, and/or schizophrenia.\n\n\n2. Discussion of Relevant Technology\n\n\nThe neurotransmitter acetylcholine binds to two types of cholinergic receptors: the ionotropic family of nicotinic receptors and the metabotropic family of muscarinic receptors. Muscarinic receptors belong to the large superfamily of plasma membrane-bound G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and show a remarkably high degree of homology across species and receptor subtype. These M1-M5 muscarinic receptors are predominantly expressed within the parasympathetic nervous system which exerts excitatory and inhibitory control over the central and peripheral tissues and participate in a number of physiologic functions, including heart rate, arousal, cognition, sensory processing, and motor control.\n\n\nMuscarinic agonists such as muscarine and pilocarpine, and antagonists, such as atropine have been known for over a century, but little progress has been made in the discovery of receptor subtype-selective compounds, thereby making it difficult to assign specific functions to the individual receptors. See, e.g., DeLapp, N. et al., “Therapeutic Opportunities for Muscarinic Receptors in the Central Nervous System,” J. Med. Chem., 43 (23), pp. 4333-4353 (2000); Hulme, E. C. et al., “Muscarinic Receptor Subtypes,” Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 30, pp. 633-673 (1990); Caulfield, M. P. et al., “Muscarinic Receptors-Characterization, Coupling, and Function,” Pharmacol. Ther., 58, pp. 319-379 (1993); Caulfield, M. P. et al., International Union of Pharmacology. XVII. Classification of Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptors,” Pharmacol. Rev., 50, pp. 279-290 (1998).\n\n\nThe Muscarinic family of receptors is the target of a large number of pharmacological agents used for various diseases, including leading drugs for COPD, asthma, urinary incontinence, glaucoma, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's (AchE inhibitors), and Pain.\n\n\nFor example, direct acting muscarinic receptor agonists have been shown to be antinociceptive in a variety of animal models of acute pain (Bartolini A., Ghelardini C., Fantetti L., Malcangio M., Malmberg-Aiello P., Giotti A. Role of muscarinic receptor subtypes in central antinociception. Br. J. Pharmacol. 105:77-82, 1992; Capone F., Aloisi A. M., Carli G., Sacerdote P., Pavone F. Oxotremorine-induced modifications of the behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to formalin pain in male rats. Brain Res. 830:292-300, 1999).\n\n\nA few studies have examined the role of muscarinic receptor activation in chronic or neuropathic pain states. In these studies, the direct and indirect elevation of cholinergic tone was shown to ameliorate tactile allodynia after intrathecal administration in a spinal ligation model of neuropathic pain in rats and these effects again were reversed by muscarinic antagonists (Hwang J.-H., Hwang K.-S., Leem J.-K., Park P.-H., Han S.-M., Lee D.-M. The antiallodynic effects of intrathecal cholinesterase inhibitors in a rat model of neuropathic pain. Anesthesiology 90:492-494, 1999; Lee E. J., Sim J. Y, Park J. Y., Hwang J. H., Park P. H., Han S. M. Intrathecal carbachol and clonidine produce a synergistic antiallodynic effect in rats with a nerve ligation injury. Can J Anaesth 49:178-84, 2002). Thus, direct or indirect activation of muscarinic receptors has been shown to elicit both acute analgesic activity and to ameliorate neuropathic pain. Muscarinic agonists and ACHE-Is are not widely used clinically owing to their propensity to induced a plethora of adverse events when administered to humans. The undesirable side effects include excessive salivation and sweating, enhanced gastrointestinal motility, and bradycardia among other adverse events. These side effects are associated with the ubiquitous expression of the muscarinic family of receptors throughout the body.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS\n\n\nTo date, five subtypes of muscarinic receptors (M1-M5) have been cloned and sequenced from a variety of species, with differential distributions in the body.\n\n\nTherefore, it was desirable to provide molecules would permit selective modulation, for example, of muscarinic receptors controlling central nervous function without also activating muscarinic receptors controlling cardiac, gastrointestinal or glandular functions.\n\n\nThere is also a need for methods for treating muscarinic receptor-mediated diseases.\n\n\nThere is also a need for modulators of muscarinic receptors that are selective as to subtypes M1-M5.\n\n\nThe term “C\nm-n\n” or “C\nm-n \ngroup” refers to any group having m to n carbon atoms.\n\n\nThe term “alkyl” refers to a saturated monovalent straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radical comprising 1 to about 12 carbon atoms.

Activation of hM1 (human Muscarinic receptor subtype 1, gene bank access NM\n—\n000738), rM1 (rat Muscarinic receptor subtype 1, gene bank access NM\n—\n080773), hM3 (human Muscarinic receptor subtype 3, gene bank access NM\n—\n000740NM\n—\n000740) and hM5 (human Muscarinic receptor subtype 5, gene bank access NM\n—\n0121258), receptors expressed in CHO cells (Chinese hamster ovary cells, ATCC) is quantified in a Molecular Devices FLIPR II™ instrument as an increase in fluorescent signal. Inhibition of hM3 and hM5 by compounds is determined by the decrease in fluorescent signal in response to 2 nM acetylcholine activation.\n\n\nCHO cells are plated in 384-well black/clear bottom poly-D-lysine plates (Becton Dickinson, 4663) at 8000 cells/well/50 μl for 24 hours in a humidified incubator (5% CO2 and 37° C.) in DMEM/F12 medium (Wisent 319-075-CL) without selection agent. Prior to experiment, the cell culture medium is removed from the plates by inversion. A loading solution of 25 μl of Hank's balanced salt solution 1× (Wisent 311-506-CL), 10 mM Hepes (Wisent 330-050-EL) and 2.5 mM Probenicid at pH 7.4 (Sigma Aldrich Canada P8761-100 g) with 2 μM calcium indicator dye (FLUO-4AM, Molecular Probes F14202) and Pluronic acid F-127 0.002% (Invitrogen P3000MP) is added to each well. Plates are incubated at 37° C. for 60 minutes prior to start the experiment. The incubation is terminated by washing the cells four times in assay buffer, leaving a residual 25 μl buffer per well. Cell plates are then transferred to the FLIPR, ready for compound additions.\n\n\nThe day of experiment, acetylcholine and compounds are diluted in assay buffer in three-fold concentration range (10 points serial dilution) for addition by FLIPR instrument. For all calcium assays, a baseline reading is taken for 10 seconds followed by the addition of 12.5 μl of compounds, resulting in a total well volume of 37.5 μl. Data is collected every second for 60 pictures and then every 6 seconds for 20 pictures prior to the addition of agonist. For hM3 and hM5, before agonist addition, a second baseline reading is taken for 10 seconds followed by the addition of 12.5 μl of agonist or buffer, producing a final volume of 50 μl. After agonist stimulation, the FLIPR continues to collect data every second for 60 pictures and then every 6 seconds for 20 pictures. The fluorescence emission is read using filter 1 (emission 510-570 nm) by the FLIPR on board CCD camera.\n\n\nCalcium mobilization output data are calculated as the maximal relative fluorescence unit (RFU) minus the minimal value for both compound and agonist reading frame (except for hM1 and rM1 using only the maximal RFU).

Briefly, rats are anesthetized with isoflurane, the left L5 and L6 are isolated and tightly ligated with 4-0 silk thread. The wound is closed by suturing and applying tissue adhesive. Compound testing is performed at day 9 to day 36 post-surgery.\n\n\nFor behavioral testing, the animals are acclimatized to the test room environment for a minimum of 30 min. In order to assess the degree of hyperalgesia, the animals are placed on a glass surface (maintained at 30° C.), and a heat-source is focused onto the plantar surface of the left paw. The time from the initiation of the heat until the animal withdraws the paw is recorded. Each animal is tested twice (with an interval of 10 min between the two tests). A decrease in Paw Withdrawal Latency (PWL, average of the two tests) relative to naïve animals indicates a hyperalgesic state. The rats with a PWL of at least 2 seconds less than average PWL of Naïve group are selected for compound testing.\n\n\nEach individual experiment consists of several groups of SNL rats, one group receiving vehicle while the other groups receive different doses of the test article. In all experiments, animals are tested for heat hyperalgesia using the plantar test before drug or vehicle administration to ensure stable heat-hyperalgesia baseline and rats are evenly divided into groups for compound testing. At a suitable interval after vehicle or drug administration, another test is performed to measure PWL. Generally, results from 2 individual experiments are pooled together and the data are presented as the mean paw withdrawal latency (PWL) (s)±standard error of mean (SEM).\n\n\nCombination Therapy (Morphine and M1 Agonist According to Present Invention) in Rat SNL Heat Hyperalgesia Assay\n\n\nA combination containing a compound of the present invention and morphine at a predetermined ratio (e.g., 0.64:1) may be tested using this instant model. The combination drugs may be administered to the rats subcutaneously, orally or combination thereof, simultaneously or sequentially. The results (expressed as ED\n50\n) for the combination may be compared with results obtained singly for the compound of the instant invention and morphine at the same or similar dosage range. If the ED\n50 \nof the combination is significantly lower than the theoretical ED\n50 \ncalculated based on the ED\n50 \nmeasured using the compound of the invention and morphine singly, then a synergy for the combination is indicated.\n\n\nMore specifically, a combination of morphine and the M1 agonist according to example 2 was investigated for treating neuropathic pain using the above disclosed Rat SNL heat hyperalgesia assay. Male Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan) weighing 200-250 g underwent spinal nerve ligation surgery as described in Kim and Chung (1992). Under isoflurane anesthesia, an incision was made dorsal to the lumbosacral plexus. The paraspinal muscles (left side) were separated from the spinous processes, the L5 and L6 spinal nerves isolated and tightly ligated with (4-0) silk suture distal to the dorsal root ganglion and prior to the entrance into the sciatic. The left L4 spinal nerve was left intact. The incision was closed and the skin was sealed. Rats were allowed to recover and then placed in cages with soft bedding. All experiments were conducted between postoperative days 7-25. Naïve rats were selected as controls. In all cases, the experimenter was blind to the treatment. Doses were pH-adjusted between 6.5 and 7.5 and administrated at a volume of 4 ml/kg. Morphine was administered subcutaneously in saline 30 minutes before testing. The compound of example 2 was administered per os in saline 60 minutes before testing. The combination of morphine and the compound of example 2 was administered at the predetermined ratio example 2:morphine of 1:1.56.\n\n\nIn order to assess the degree of heat hyperalgesia, the rats were individually placed in Plexiglas boxes on the glass surface (maintained at 30° C.) of a paw thermal stimulator system (Model 390, series 8, IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, USA) and allowed to acclimate for 30 min. A thermal stimulus, in the form of a radiant heat beam was focused onto the plantar surface of the affected paw. In each test session, rats were tested twice at approximately 5 min apart. Paw withdrawal latencies (PWLs) were calculated as the mean of the two values. The results obtained are summarized in Table 2, below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nED50 for morphine, the compound of example 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand combination therapy of 1 part of compound\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof example 2 and 1.56 parts of morphine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nED\n50\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDrug\n\n\nμmol/kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMorphine\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound of example 2\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCombination of 1 part of the compound\n\n\n0.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nof example 2 and 1.56 parts of morphine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAs ED\n50 \nfor the combination is significantly lower than corresponding values for the components alone, it is concluded that the combination of morphine and the compound of example 2 has a synergistic effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe invention will further be described in more detail by the following Examples which describe methods whereby compounds of the present invention may be prepared, purified, analyzed and biologically tested, and which are not to be construed as limiting the invention.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nEthyl 4-[4-[(3aS,7aS)-2-oxo-3a,4,5,6,7,7a-hexahydro-3H-benzoimidazol-1-yl]-1-piperidyl]-4-methyl-piperidine-1-carboxylate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep A.
