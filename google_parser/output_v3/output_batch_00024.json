No. 6,682,736, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/113,647, filed Dec. 23, 1998, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety herein.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, there are provided fully human monoclonal antibodies against human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Nucleotide sequences encoding and amino acid sequences comprising heavy and light chain immunoglobulin molecules, particularly contiguous heavy and light chain sequences spanning the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), specifically from within FR1 and/or CDR1 through CDR3 and/or within FR4, are provided. Further provided are antibodies having similar binding properties and antibodies (or other antagonists) having similar functionality as antibodies disclosed herein.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE TECHNOLOGY \n\n\n \n \n \nRegulation of immune response in patients would provide a desirable treatment of many human diseases that could lead to a specificity of action that is rarely found through the use of conventional drugs. Both up-regulation and down-regulation of responses of the immune system would be possible. The roles of T cells and B cells have been extensively studied and characterized in connection with the regulation of immune response. From these studies, the role of T cells appear, in many cases, to be particularly important in disease prevention and treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nT cells possess very complex systems for controlling their interactions. Interactions between T cells utilize numerous receptors and soluble factors for the process. Thus, what effect any particular signal may have on the immune response generally varies and depends on the particular factors, receptors and counter-receptors that are involved in the pathway. The pathways for down-regulating responses are as important as those required for activation. Thymic education leading to T-cell tolerance is one mechanism for preventing an immune response to a particular antigen. Other mechanisms, such as secretion of suppressive cytokines, are also known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivation of T cells requires not only stimulation through the antigen receptor (T cell receptor (TCR)), but additional signaling through co-stimulatory surface molecules such as CD28. The ligands for CD28 are the B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) proteins, which are expressed on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, activated B-cells or monocytes that interact with T-cell CD28 or CTLA-4 to deliver a costimulatory signal. The role of costimulatory signaling was studied in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) by Perrin et al. \nImmunol Res \n14:189-99 (1995). EAE is an autoimmune disorder, induced by Th1 cells directed against myelin antigens that provides an in vivo model for studying the role of B7-mediated costimulation in the induction of a pathological immune response. Using a soluble fusion protein ligand for the B7 receptors, as well as monoclonal antibodies specific for either CD80 or CD86, Perrin et al. demonstrated that B7 costimulation plays a prominent role in determining clinical disease outcome in EAE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe interaction between B7 and CD28 is one of several co-stimulatory signaling pathways that appear to be sufficient to trigger the maturation and proliferation of antigen specific T-cells. Lack of co-stimulation, and the concomitant inadequacy of IL-2 production, prevent subsequent proliferation of the T cell and induce a state of non-reactivity termed “anergy”. A variety of viruses and tumors may block T cell activation and proliferation, leading to insufficient activity or non-reactivity of the host's immune system to the infected or transformed cells. Among a number of possible T-cell disturbances, anergy may be at least partly responsible for the failure of the host to clear the pathogenic or tumorgenic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of the B7 protein to mediate anti-tumor immunity has been described in Chen et al. \nCell \n71:1093-1102 (1992) and Townsend and Allison \nScience \n259:368 (1993). Schwartz \nCell \n71:1065 (1992) reviews the role of CD28, CTLA-4, and B7 in IL-2 production and immunotherapy. Harding et al. \nNature \n356:607-609 (1994) demonstrates that CD28 mediated signaling co-stimulates murine T cells and prevents the induction of anergy in T cell clones. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,434,131, 5,770,197, and 5,773,253, and International Patent Application Nos. WO 93/00431, WO 95/01994, WO 95/03408, WO 95/24217, and WO 95/33770.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the foregoing, it was clear that T-cells required two types of signals from the antigen presenting cell (APC) for activation and subsequent differentiation to effector function. First, there is an antigen specific signal generated by interactions between the TCR on the T-cell and MHC molecules presenting peptides on the APC. Second, there is an antigen-independent signal that is mediated by the interaction of CD28 with members of the B7 family (B7-1 (CD80) or B7-2 (CD86)). Exactly where CTLA-4 fit into the milieu of immune responsiveness was initially evasive. Murine CTLA-4 was first identified and cloned by Brunet et al. \nNature \n328:267-270 (1987), as part of a quest for molecules that are preferentially expressed on cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Human CTLA-4 was identified and cloned shortly thereafter by Dariavach et al. \nEur. J. Immunol. \n18:1901-1905 (1988). The murine and human CTLA-4 molecules possess approximately 76% overall sequence homology and approach complete sequence identity in their cytoplasmic domains (Dariavach et al. \nEur. J. Immunol. \n18:1901-1905 (1988)). CTLA-4 is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of proteins. The Ig superfamily is a group of proteins that share key structural features of either a variable (V) or constant (C) domain of Ig molecules. Members of the Ig superfamily include, but are not limited to, the immunoglobulins themselves, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class molecules (i.e., MHC class I and II), and TCR molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn 1991, Linsley et al. \nJ. Exp. Med. \n174:561-569 (1991), proposed that CTLA-4 was a second receptor for B7. Similarly, Harper et al. \nJ. Immunol \n147:1037-44 (1991) demonstrated that the CTLA-4 and CD28 molecules are closely related in both mouse and human as to sequence, message expression, gene structure, and chromosomal location. See also Balzano et al. \nInt J Cancer Suppl \n7:28-32 (1992). Further evidence of this role arose through functional studies. For example, Lenschow et al. \nScience \n257:789-792 (1992) demonstrated that CTLA-4-Ig induced long term survival of pancreatic islet grafts. Freeman et al. \nScience \n262:907-909 (1993) examined the role of CTLA-4 in B7 deficient mice. Examination of the ligands for CTLA-4 are described in Lenschow et al. \nP.N.A.S. \n90:11054-11058 (1993). Linsley et al. \nScience \n257:792-795 (1992) describes immunosuppression in vivo by a soluble form of CTLA-4. Linsley et al. \nJ Exp Med \n176:1595-604 (1992) prepared antibodies that bound CTLA-4 and that were not cross-reactive with CD28 and concluded that CTLA-4 is coexpressed with CD28 on activated T lymphocytes and cooperatively regulates T cell adhesion and activation by B7. Kuchroo et al. \nCell \n80:707-18 (1995) demonstrated that the B7-1 and B7-2 costimulatory molecules differentially activated the Th1/Th2 developmental pathways. Yi-qun et al. \nInt Immunol \n8:37-44 (1996) demonstrated that there are differential requirements for co-stimulatory signals from B7 family members by resting versus recently activated memory T cells towards soluble recall antigens. See also de Boer et al. \nEur J Immunol \n23:3120-5 (1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral groups proposed alternative or distinct receptor/ligand interactions for CTLA-4 as compared to CD28 and even proposed a third B-7 complex that was recognized by a BB1 antibody. See, for example, Hathcock et al. \nScience \n262:905-7 (1993), Freeman et al. \nScience \n262:907-9 (1993), Freeman et al. \nJ Exp Med \n178:2185-92 (1993), Lenschow et al. \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n90:11054-8 (1993), Razi-Wolf et al. \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n90:11182-6 (1993), and Boussiotis et al. \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n90:11059-63 (1993). But, see, Freeman et al. \nJ Immunol \n161:2708-15 (1998) who discuss finding that \nBB\n 1 antibody binds a molecule that is identical to the cell surface form of CD74 and, therefore, the BB1 mAb binds to a protein distinct from B7-1, and this epitope is also present on the B7-1 protein. Thus, this observation required the field to reconsider studies using BB1 mAb in the analysis of CD80 expression and function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBeginning in 1993 and culminating in 1995, investigators began to further delineate the role of CTLA-4 in T-cell stimulation. First, through the use of monoclonal antibodies against CTLA-4, Walunas et al. \nImmunity \n1:405-13 (1994) provided evidence that CTLA-4 can function as a negative regulator of T cell activation. Thereafter, Waterhouse et al. \nScience \n270:985-988 (1995) demonstrated that mice deficient for CTLA-4 accumulated T cell blasts with up-regulated activation markers in their lymph nodes and spleens. The blast cells also infiltrated liver, heart, lung, and pancreas tissue, and amounts of serum immunoglobulin were elevated and their T cells proliferated spontaneously and strongly when stimulated through the T cell receptor, however, they were sensitive to cell death induced by cross-linking of the Fas receptor and by gamma irradiation. Waterhouse et al. concluded that CTLA-4 acts as a negative regulator of T cell activation and is vital for the control of lymphocyte homeostasis. In a comment in the same issue, Allison and Krummel \nScience \n270:932-933 (1995), discussed the work of Waterhouse et al. as demonstrative that CTLA-4 acts to down regulate T-cell responsiveness or has an inhibitory signaling role in T-cell activation and development. Tivol et al. \nImmunity \n3:541-7 (1995) also generated CTLA-4-deficient mice and demonstrated that such mice rapidly develop lymphoproliferative disease with multiorgan lymphocytic infiltration and tissue destruction, with particularly severe myocarditis and pancreatitis. They concluded that CTLA-4 plays a key role in down-regulating T cell activation and maintaining immunologic homeostasis. Also, Krummel and Allison \nJ Exp Med \n182:459-65 (1995) further clarified that CD28 and CTLA-4 have opposing effects on the response of T cells to stimulation. They generated an antibody to CTLA-4 and investigated the effects of its binding to CTLA-4 in a system using highly purified T cells. In their report, they showed that the presence of low levels of B7-2 on freshly explanted T cells can partially inhibit T cell proliferation, and this inhibition was mediated by interactions with CTLA-4. Cross-linking of CTLA-4 together with the TCR and CD28 strongly inhibits proliferation and IL-2 secretion by T cells. Finally, the results showed that CD28 and CTLA-4 deliver opposing signals that appear to be integrated by the T cell in determining the response to antigen. Thus, they concluded that the outcome of T cell antigen receptor stimulation is regulated by CD28 costimulatory signals, as well as inhibitory signals derived from CTLA-4. See also Krummel et al. \nInt Immunol \n8:519-23 (1996) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,811,097 and International Patent Application No. WO 97/20574.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of additional experiments have been conducted further elucidating the above function of CTLA-4. For example, Walunas et al. \nJ Exp Med \n183:2541-50 (1996), through the use of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, suggested that CTLA-4 signaling does not regulate cell survival or responsiveness to IL-2, but does inhibit CD28-dependent IL-2 production. Also, Perrin et al. \nJ Immunol \n157:1333-6 (1996), demonstrated that anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), exacerbated the disease and enhanced mortality. Disease exacerbation was associated with enhanced production of the encephalitogenic cytokines TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-2. Thus, they concluded that CTLA-4 regulates the intensity of the autoimmune response in EAE, attenuating inflammatory cytokine production and clinical disease manifestations. See also Hurwitz et al. \nJ Neuroimmunol \n73:57-62 (1997) and Cepero et al. \nJ Exp Med \n188:199-204 (1998) (an anti-CTLA-4 hairpin ribozyme that specifically abrogates CTLA-4 expression after gene transfer into a murine T-cell model).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, Blair et al. \nJ Immunol \n160:12-5 (1998) assessed the functional effects of a panel of CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on resting human CD4+ T cells. Their results demonstrated that some CTLA-4 mAbs could inhibit proliferative responses of resting CD4+ cells and cell cycle transition from G0 to G1. The inhibitory effects of CTLA-4 were evident within 4 h, at a time when cell surface CTLA-4 expression remained undetectable. Other CTLA-4 mAbs, however, had no detectable inhibitory effects, indicating that binding of mAbs to CTLA-4 alone was not sufficient to mediate down-regulation of T cell responses. Interestingly, while IL-2 production was shut off, inhibitory anti-CTLA-4 mAbs permitted induction and expression of the cell survival gene bcl-X(L). Consistent with this observation, cells remained viable and apoptosis was not detected after CTLA-4 ligation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with anergy, Perez et al. \nImmunity \n6:411-7 (1997) demonstrated that the induction of T cell anergy was prevented by blocking CTLA-4 and concluded that the outcome of antigen recognition by T cells is determined by the interaction of CD28 or CTLA-4 on the T cells with B7 molecules. Also, Van Parijs et al. \nJ Exp Med \n186:1119-28 (1997) examined the role of \ninterleukin\n 12 and costimulators in T cell anergy in vivo and found that through inhibiting CTLA-4 engagement during anergy induction, T cell proliferation was blocked, and full Th1 differentiation was not promoted. However, T cells exposed to tolerogenic antigen in the presence of both IL-12 and anti-CTLA-4 antibody were not anergized, and behaved identically to T cells which have encountered immunogenic antigen. These results suggested that two processes contribute to the induction of anergy in vivo: CTLA-4 engagement, which leads to a block in the ability of T cells to proliferate, and the absence of a prototypic inflammatory cytokine, IL-12, which prevents the differentiation of T cells into Th1 effector cells. The combination of IL-12 and anti-CTLA-4 antibody was sufficient to convert a normally tolerogenic stimulus to an immunogenic one.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with infections, McCoy et al. \nJ Exp Med \n186:183-7 (1997) demonstrated that anti-CTLA-4 antibodies greatly enhanced and accelerated the T cell immune response to \nNippostrongylus brasiliensis, \nresulting in a profound reduction in adult worm numbers and early termination of parasite egg production. See also Murphy et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n161:4153-4160 (1998) (\nLeishmania donovani\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with cancer, Kwon et al. \nPNAS USA \n94:8099-103 (1997) established a syngeneic murine prostate cancer model and examined two distinct manipulations intended to elicit an antiprostate cancer response through enhanced T cell costimulation: (i) provision of direct costimulation by prostate cancer cells transduced to express the B7.1 ligand and (ii) in vivo antibody-mediated blockade of T cell CTLA-4, which prevents T cell down-regulation. It was demonstrated that in vivo antibody-mediated blockade of CTLA-4 enhanced antiprostate cancer immune responses. Also, Yang et al. \nCancer Res \n57:4036-41 (1997) investigated whether the blockade of the CTLA-4 function leads to enhancement of antitumor T cell responses at various stages of tumor growth. Based on in vitro and in vivo results they found that CTLA-4 blockade in tumor-bearing individuals enhanced the capacity to generate antitumor T-cell responses, but the expression of such an enhancing effect was restricted to early stages of tumor growth in their model. Further, Hurwitz et al. \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n95:10067-71 (1998) investigated the generation of a T cell-mediated antitumor response depends on T cell receptor engagement by major histocompatibility complex/antigen as well as CD28 ligation by B7. Certain tumors, such as the SM1 mammary carcinoma, were refractory to anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy. Thus, through use of a combination of CTLA-4 blockade and a vaccine consisting of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-expressing SM1 cells, regression of parental SM1 tumors was observed, despite the ineffectiveness of either treatment alone. This combination therapy resulted in long-lasting immunity to SM1 and depended on both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. The findings suggested that CTLA-4 blockade acts at the level of a host-derived antigen-presenting cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with diabetes, Luhder et al. \nJ Exp Med \n187:427-32 (1998) injected an anti-CTLA-4 mAb into a TCR transgenic mouse model of diabetes at different stages of disease. They found that engagement of CTLA-4 at the time when potentially diabetogenic T cells are first activated is a pivotal event; if engagement is permitted, invasion of the islets occurs, but remains quite innocuous for months. If not, insulitis is much more aggressive, and diabetes quickly ensues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with vaccine immunization, Horspool et al. \nJ Immunol \n160:2706-14 (1998) found that intact anti-CTLA-4 mAb but not Fab fragments suppressed the primary humoral response to pCIA/beta gal without affecting recall responses, indicating CTLA-4 activation inhibited Ab production but not T cell priming. Blockade of the ligands for CD28 and CTLA-4, CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2), revealed distinct and nonoverlapping function. Blockade of CD80 at initial immunization completely abrogated primary and secondary Ab responses, whereas blockade of CD86 suppressed primary but not secondary responses. Simultaneous blockade of CD80+CD86 was less effective at suppressing Ab responses than either alone. Enhancement of costimulation via coinjection of B7-expressing plasmids augmented CTL responses but not Ab responses, and without evidence of Th1 to Th2 skewing. These findings suggest complex and distinct roles for CD28, CTLA-4, CD80, and CD86 in T cell costimulation following nucleic acid vaccination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with allograft rejection, Markees et al. \nJ Clin Invest \n101:2446-55 (1998) found in a mouse model of skin allograft rejection that acceptance initially depended on the presence of IFN-gamma, CTLA-4, and CD4(+) T cells. Addition of anti-CTLA-4 or anti-IFN-gamma mAb to the protocol was associated with prompt graft rejection, whereas anti-IL-4 mAb had no effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with the role of CTLA-4 in relation to CD28, Fallarino et al. \nJ Exp Med \n188:205-10 (1998) generated TCR transgenic/recombinase activating gene 2-deficient/CD28-wild-type or CD28-deficient mice which were immunized with an antigen-expressing tumor. Primed T cells from both types of mice produced cytokines and proliferated in response to stimulator cells lacking B7 expression. However, whereas the response of CD28+/+T cells was augmented by costimulation with B7-1, the response of the CD28−/−T cells was strongly inhibited. This inhibition was reversed by monoclonal antibody against B7-1 or CTLA-4. Thus, CTLA-4 can potently inhibit T cell activation in the absence of CD28, indicating that antagonism of a TCR-mediated signal is sufficient to explain the inhibitory effect of CTLA-4. Also, Lin et al. \nJ Exp Med \n188:199-204 (1998) studied rejection of heart allografts in CD28-deficient mice. H-2(q) hearts were transplanted into allogeneic wild-type or CD28-deficient mice (H-2(b)). Graft rejection was delayed in CD28-deficient compared with wild-type mice. Treatment of wild-type recipients with CTLA-4-immunoglobulin (Ig), or with anti-B7-1 plus anti-B7-2 mAbs significantly prolonged allograft survival. In contrast, treatment of CD28-deficient mice with CTLA-4-Ig, anti-B7-1 plus anti-B7-2 mAbs, or a blocking anti-CTLA-4 mAb induced acceleration of allograft rejection. This increased rate of graft rejection was associated with more severe mononuclear cell infiltration and enhanced levels of IFN-gamma and IL-6 transcripts in donor hearts of untreated wild-type and CTLA-4-Ig- or anti-CTLA-4 mAb-treated CD28-deficient mice. Thus, the negative regulatory role of CTLA-4 extends beyond its potential ability to prevent CD28 activation through ligand competition. Even in the absence of CD28, CTLA-4 plays an inhibitory role in the regulation of allograft rejection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, further characterization of the expression of CTLA-4 has been investigated. For example, Alegre et al. \nJ Immunol \n157:4762-70 (1996) proposed that surface CTLA-4 is rapidly internalized, which may explain the low levels of expression generally detected on the cell surface. They concluded that both CD28 and IL-2 play important roles in the up-regulation of CTLA-4 expression. In addition, the cell surface accumulation of CTLA-4 appeared to be primarily regulated by its rapid endocytosis. Also, Castan et al. \nImmunology \n90:265-71 (1997) based on in situ immunohistological analyses of the expression of CTLA-4, suggested that germinal center T cells, which were CTLA-4 positive, could be important to immune regulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in view of the broad and pivotal role that CTLA-4 appears to possess in immune responsiveness, it would be desirable to generate antibodies to CTLA-4 that can be utilized effectively in immunotherapy. Moreover, it would be desirable to generate antibodies against CTLA-4 that can be utilized in chronic diseases in which repeat administrations of the antibodies are required.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n provides a series of nucleotide and an amino acid sequences of heavy chain and kappa light chain immunoglobulin molecules in accordance with the invention: 4.1.1 (\nFIG. 1A\n), 4.8.1 (\nFIG. 1B\n), 4.14.3 (\nFIG. 1C\n), 6.1.1 (\nFIG. 1D\n), 3.1.1 (\nFIG. 1E\n), 4.10.2 (\nFIG. 1F\n), 2.1.3 (\nFIG. 1G\n), 4.13.1 (\nFIG. 1H\n), 11.2.1 (\nFIG. 1I\n), 11.6.1 (\nFIG. 1J\n), 11.7.1 (\nFIG. 1K\n), 12.3.1.1 (\nFIG. 1L\n), and 12.9.1.1 (\nFIG. 1M\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n provides a sequence alignment between the predicted heavy chain amino acid sequences from the clones 4.1.1, 4.8.1, 4.14.3, 6.1.1, 3.1.1, 4.10.2, 4.13.1, 11.2.1, 11.6.1, 11.7.1, 12.3.1.1, and 12.9.1.1 and the germline DP-50 (3-33) amino acid sequence.

Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. Generally, nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and techniques of, cell and tissue culture, molecular biology, and protein and oligo- or polynucleotide chemistry and hybridization described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques are used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, and tissue culture and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are performed according to manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The foregoing techniques and procedures are generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification. See e.g., Sambrook et al. \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual \n(2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)), which is incorporated herein by reference. The nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques are used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs utilized in accordance with the present disclosure, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “isolated polynucleotide” as used herein shall mean a polynucleotide of genomic, cDNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof, which by virtue of its origin the “isolated polynucleotide” (1) is not associated with all or a portion of a polynucleotide in which the “isolated polynucleotide” is found in nature, (2) is operably linked to a polynucleotide which it is not linked to in nature, or (3) does not occur in nature as part of a larger sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “isolated protein” referred to herein means a protein of cDNA, recombinant RNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof, which by virtue of its origin, or source of derivation, the “isolated protein” (1) is not associated with proteins found in nature, (2) is free of other proteins from the same source, e.g. free of murine proteins, (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, or (4) does not occur in nature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “polypeptide” as used herein as a generic term to refer to native protein, fragments, or analogs of a polypeptide sequence. Hence, native protein, fragments, and analogs are species of the polypeptide genus. Preferred polypeptides in accordance with the invention comprise the human heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules and the human kappa light chain immunoglobulin molecules represented in \nFIG. 1\n, as well as antibody molecules formed by combinations comprising the heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules with light chain immunoglobulin molecules, such as the kappa light chain immunoglobulin molecules, and vice versa, as well as fragments and analogs thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “naturally-occurring” as used herein as applied to an object refers to the fact that an object can be found in nature. For example, a polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory or otherwise is naturally-occurring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “operably linked” as used herein refers to positions of components so described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. A control sequence “operably linked” to a coding sequence is ligated in such a way that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the control sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “control sequence” as used herein refers to polynucleotide sequences which are necessary to effect the expression and processing of coding sequences to which they are ligated. The nature of such control sequences differs depending upon the host organism; in prokaryotes, such control sequences generally include promoter, ribosomal binding site, and transcription termination sequence; in eukaryotes, generally, such control sequences include promoters and transcription termination sequence. The term “control sequences” is intended to include, at a minimum, all components whose presence is essential for expression and processing, and can also include additional components whose presence is advantageous, for example, leader sequences and fusion partner sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “polynucleotide” as referred to herein means a polymeric form of nucleotides of at least 10 bases in length, either ribonucleotides or deoxynucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide. The term includes single and double stranded forms of DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “oligonucleotide” referred to herein includes naturally occurring, and modified nucleotides linked together by naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring oligonucleotide linkages. Oligonucleotides are a polynucleotide subset generally comprising a length of 200 bases or fewer. Preferably oligonucleotides are 10 to 60 bases in length and most preferably 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 to 40 bases in length. Oligonucleotides are usually single stranded, e.g. for probes; although oligonucleotides may be double stranded, e.g. for use in the construction of a gene mutant. Oligonucleotides of the invention can be either sense or antisense oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “naturally occurring nucleotides” referred to herein includes deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides. The term “modified nucleotides” referred to herein includes nucleotides with modified or substituted sugar groups and the like. The term “oligonucleotide linkages” referred to herein includes oligonucleotides linkages such as phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate, phoshoraniladate, phosphoroamidate, and the like.

Acids Res. \n16:3209 (1988); Zon et al. \nAnti\n-\nCancer Drug Design \n6:539 (1991); Zon et al. \nOligonucleotides and Analogues: A Practical Approach, \npp. 87-108 (F. Eckstein, Ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford England (1991)); Stec et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,151,510; Uhlmann and Peyman \nChemical Reviews \n90:543 (1990), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. An oligonucleotide can include a label for detection, if desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “selectively hybridize” referred to herein means to detectably and specifically bind. Polynucleotides, oligonucleotides and fragments thereof in accordance with the invention selectively hybridize to nucleic acid strands under hybridization and wash conditions that minimize appreciable amounts of detectable binding to nonspecific nucleic acids. High stringency conditions can be used to achieve selective hybridization conditions as known in the art and discussed herein. Generally, the nucleic acid sequence homology between the polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, and fragments of the invention and a nucleic acid sequence of interest will be at least 80%, and more typically with preferably increasing homologies of at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, and 100%. Two amino acid sequences are homologous if there is a partial or complete identity between their sequences. For example, 85% homology means that 85% of the amino acids are identical when the two sequences are aligned for maximum matching. Gaps (in either of the two sequences being matched) are allowed in maximizing matching; gap lengths of 5 or less are preferred with 2 or less being more preferred. Alternatively and preferably, two protein sequences (or polypeptide sequences derived from them of at least 30 amino acids in length) are homologous, as this term is used herein, if they have an alignment score of at more than 5 (in standard deviation units) using the program ALIGN with the mutation data matrix and a gap penalty of 6 or greater. See Dayhoff, M. O., in \nAtlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, \npp. 101-110 (\nVolume\n 5, National Biomedical Research Foundation (1972)) and \nSupplement\n 2 to this volume, pp. 1-10. The two sequences or parts thereof are more preferably homologous if their amino acids are greater than or equal to 50% identical when optimally aligned using the ALIGN program. The term “corresponds to” is used herein to mean that a polynucleotide sequence is homologous (i.e., is identical, not strictly evolutionarily related) to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence, or that a polypeptide sequence is identical to a reference polypeptide sequence. In contradistinction, the term “complementary to” is used herein to mean that the complementary sequence is homologous to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence. For illustration, the nucleotide sequence “TATAC” corresponds to a reference sequence “TATAC” and is complementary to a reference sequence “GTATA”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between two or more polynucleotide or amino acid sequences: “reference sequence”, “comparison window”, “sequence identity”, “percentage of sequence identity”, and “substantial identity”. A “reference sequence” is a defined sequence used as a basis for a sequence comparison; a reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence, for example, as a segment of a full-length cDNA or gene sequence given in a sequence listing or may comprise a complete cDNA or gene sequence. Generally, a reference sequence is at least 18 nucleotides or 6 amino acids in length, frequently at least 24 nucleotides or 8 amino acids in length, and often at least 48 nucleotides or 16 amino acids in length. Since two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences may each (1) comprise a sequence (i.e., a portion of the complete polynucleotide or amino acid sequence) that is similar between the two molecules, and (2) may further comprise a sequence that is divergent between the two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences, sequence comparisons between two (or more) molecules are typically performed by comparing sequences of the two molecules over a “comparison window” to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. A “comparison window”, as used herein, refers to a conceptual segment of at least 18 contiguous nucleotide positions or 6 amino acids wherein a polynucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of at least 18 contiguous nucleotides or 6 amino acid sequences and wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions, deletions, substitutions, and the like (i.e., gaps) of 20 percent or less as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for aligning a comparison window may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman \nAdv. Appl. Math. \n2:482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n48:443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman Proc. \nNatl. Acad. Sci. \n(\nU.S.A.\n) 85:2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, (Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), Geneworks, or MacVector software packages), or by inspection, and the best alignment (i.e., resulting in the highest percentage of homology over the comparison window) generated by the various methods is selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “sequence identity” means that two polynucleotide or amino acid sequences are identical (i.e., on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide or residue-by-residue basis) over the comparison window. The term “percentage of sequence identity” is calculated by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over the window of comparison, determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base (e.g., A, T, C, G, U, or I) or residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the comparison window (i.e., the window size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. The terms “substantial identity” as used herein denotes a characteristic of a polynucleotide or amino acid sequence, wherein the polynucleotide or amino acid comprises a sequence that has at least 85 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 to 95 percent sequence identity, more usually at least 99 percent sequence identity as compared to a reference sequence over a comparison window of at least 18 nucleotide (6 amino acid) positions, frequently over a window of at least 24-48 nucleotide (8-16 amino acid) positions, wherein the percentage of sequence identity is calculated by comparing the reference sequence to the sequence which may include deletions or additions which total 20 percent or less of the reference sequence over the comparison window. The reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the twenty conventional amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage. See \nImmunology—A Synthesis \n(2\nnd \nEdition, E. S. Golub and D. R. Gren, Eds., Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Mass. (1991)), which is incorporated herein by reference. Stereoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino acids such as α-, α-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino acids may also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present invention. Examples of unconventional amino acids include: 4-hydroxyproline, γ-carboxyglutamate, ε-N,N,N-trimethyllysine, ε-N-acetyllysine, O-phosphoserine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine, σ-N-methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and imino acids (e.g., 4-hydroxyproline). In the polypeptide notation used herein, the lefthand direction is the amino terminal direction and the righthand direction is the carboxy-terminal direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, unless specified otherwise, the lefthand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5′ end; the lefthand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5′ direction. The direction of 5′ to 3′ addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5′ to the 5′ end of the RNA transcript are referred to as “upstream sequences”; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3′ to the 3′ end of the RNA transcript are referred to as “downstream sequences”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs applied to polypeptides, the term “substantial identity” means that two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 80 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 95 percent sequence identity, and most preferably at least 99 percent sequence identity. Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains. For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains is serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is lysine, arginine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur-containing side chains is cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, glutamic-aspartic, and asparagine-glutamine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed herein, minor variations in the amino acid sequences of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules are contemplated as being encompassed by the present invention, providing that the variations in the amino acid sequence maintain at least 75%, more preferably at least 80%, 90%, 95%, and most preferably 99%. In particular, conservative amino acid replacements are contemplated. Conservative replacements are those that take place within a family of amino acids that are related in their side chains. Genetically encoded amino acids are generally divided into families: (1) acidic=aspartate, glutamate; (2) basic=lysine, arginine, histidine; (3) non-polar=alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan; and (4) uncharged polar=glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, serine, threonine, tyrosine. More preferred families are: serine and threonine are aliphatic-hydroxy family; asparagine and glutamine are an amide-containing family; alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine are an aliphatic family; and phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are an aromatic family. For example, it is reasonable to expect that an isolated replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, a threonine with a serine, or a similar replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid will not have a major effect on the binding or properties of the resulting molecule, especially if the replacement does not involve an amino acid within a framework site. Whether an amino acid change results in a functional peptide can readily be determined by assaying the specific activity of the polypeptide derivative. Assays are described in detail herein. Fragments or analogs of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in the art. Preferred amino- and carboxy-termini of fragments or analogs occur near boundaries of functional domains. Structural and functional domains can be identified by comparison of the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequence databases. Preferably, computerized comparison methods are used to identify sequence motifs or predicted protein conformation domains that occur in other proteins of known structure and/or function. Methods to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional structure are known. Bowie et al. \nScience \n253:164 (1991). Thus, the foregoing examples demonstrate that those of skill in the art can recognize sequence motifs and structural conformations that may be used to define structural and functional domains in accordance with the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and (4) confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties of such analogs. Analogs can include various muteins of a sequence other than the naturally-occurring peptide sequence. For example, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (preferably conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (preferably in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts. A conservative amino acid substitution should not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in \nProteins, Structures and Molecular Principles \n(Creighton, Ed., W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984)); \nIntroduction to Protein Structure \n(C. Branden and J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991)); and Thornton et at. \nNature \n354:105 (1991), which are each incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “polypeptide fragment” as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion, but where the remaining amino acid sequence is identical to the corresponding positions in the naturally-occurring sequence deduced, for example, from a full-length cDNA sequence. Fragments typically are at least 5, 6, 8 or 10 amino acids long, preferably at least 14 amino acids long, more preferably at least 20 amino acids long, usually at least 50 amino acids long, and even more preferably at least 70 amino acids long. The term “analog” as used herein refers to polypeptides which are comprised of a segment of at least 25 amino acids that has substantial identity to a portion of a deduced amino acid sequence and which has at least one of the following properties: (1) specific binding to CTLA-4, under suitable binding conditions, (2) ability to block CTLA-4 binding with its receptors, or (3) ability to inhibit CTLA-4 expressing cell growth in vitro or in vivo. Typically, polypeptide analogs comprise a conservative amino acid substitution (or addition or deletion) with respect to the naturally-occurring sequence. Analogs typically are at least 20 amino acids long, preferably at least 50 amino acids long or longer, and can often be as long as a full-length naturally-occurring polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drus with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound are termed “peptide mimetics” or “peptidomimetics”. Fauchere, \nJ. Adv. Drug Res. \n15:29 (1986); Veber and Freidinger TINS p.392 (1985); and Evans et al. I Med. Chem. 30:1229 (1987), which are incorporated herein by reference. Such compounds are often developed with the aid of computerized molecular modeling. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce an equivalent therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biochemical property or pharmacological activity), such as human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from the group consisting of: —CH\n2\nNH—, —CH\n2\nS—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH═CH—(cis and trans), —COCH\n2\n—, —CH(OH)CH\n2\n—, and —CH\n2\nSO—, by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may be used to generate more stable peptides. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods known in the art (Rizo and Gierasch \nAnn. Rev. Biochem. \n61:387 (1992), incorporated herein by reference); for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Antibody” or “antibody peptide(s)” refer to an intact antibody, or a binding fragment thereof that competes with the intact antibody for specific binding. Binding fragments are produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Binding fragments include Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv, and single-chain antibodies. An antibody other than a “bispecific” or “bifunctional” antibody is understood to have each of its binding sites identical. An antibody substantially inhibits adhesion of a receptor to a counterreceptor when an excess of antibody reduces the quantity of receptor bound to counterreceptor by at least about 20%, 40%, 60% or 80%, and more usually greater than about 85% (as measured in an in vitro competitive binding assay).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “epitope” includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. An antibody is said to specifically bind an antigen when the dissociation constant is ≦1 μM, preferably ≦100 nM and most preferably ≦10 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “agent” is used herein to denote a chemical compound, a mixture of chemical compounds, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made from biological materials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “label” or “labeled” refers to incorporation of a detectable marker, e.g., by incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid or attachment to a polypeptide of biotinyl moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g., streptavidin containing a fluorescent marker or enzymatic activity that can be detected by optical or colorimetric methods). In certain situations, the label or marker can also be therapeutic. Various methods of labeling polypeptides and glycoproteins are known in the art and may be used. Examples of labels for polypeptides include, but are not limited to, the following: radioisotopes or radionuclides (e.g., \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n35\nS, \n90\nY, \n99\nTc, \n111\nIn, \n125\nI, \n131\nI), fluorescent labels (e.g., FITC, rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic labels (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, β-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase), chemiluminescent, biotinyl groups, predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags). In some embodiments, labels are attached by spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutical agent or drug” as used herein refers to a chemical compound or composition capable of inducing a desired therapeutic effect when properly administered to a patient. Other chemistry terms herein are used according to conventional usage in the art, as exemplified by \nThe McGraw\n-\nHill Dictionary of Chemical Terms \n(Parker, S., Ed., McGraw-Hill, San Francisco (1985)), incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antineoplastic agent” is used herein to refer to agents that have the functional property of inhibiting a development or progression of a neoplasm in a human, particularly a malignant (cancerous) lesion, such as a carcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, or leukemia. Inhibition of metastasis is frequently a property of antineoplastic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “substantially pure” means an object species is the predominant species present (i.e., on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other individual species in the composition), and preferably a substantially purified fraction is a composition wherein the object species comprises at least about 50 percent (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species present. Generally, a substantially pure composition will comprise more than about 80 percent of all macromolecular species present in the composition, more preferably more than about 85%, 90%, 95%, and 99%. Most preferably, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity (contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods) wherein the composition consists essentially of a single macromolecular species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term patient includes human and veterinary subjects.\n\n\n \nAntibody Structure\n\n\n \n \n \nThe basic antibody structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one “light” (about 25 kDa) and one “heavy” chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a “J” region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a “D” region of about 10 more amino acids. See generally, \nFundamental Immunology \nCh. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, an intact IgG antibody has two binding sites. Except in bifunctional or bispecific antibodies, the two binding sites are the same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chains all exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hyper variable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs from the two chains of each pair are aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. From N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chains comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest \n(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987 and 1991)), or Chothia & Lesk \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901-917 (1987); Chothia et al. \nNature \n342:878-883 (1989).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab’ fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai & Lachmann \nClin. Exp. Immunol. \n79: 315-321 (1990), Kostelny et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n148:1547-1553 (1992). In addition, bispecific antibodies may be formed as “diabodies” (Holliger et al. “'Diabodies': small bivalent and bispecific antibody fragments” \nPNAS USA \n90:6444-6448 (1993)) or “Janusins” (Traunecker et al. “Bispecific single chain molecules (Janusins) target cytotoxic lymphocytes on HIV infected cells” \nEMBO J \n10:3655-3659 (1991) and Traunecker et al. “Janusin: new molecular design for bispecific reagents” \nInt J Cancer Suppl \n7:51-52 (1992)). Production of bispecific antibodies can be a relatively labor intensive process compared with production of conventional antibodies and yields and degree of purity are generally lower for bispecific antibodies. Bispecific antibodies do not exist in the form of fragments having a single binding site (e.g., Fab, Fab′, and Fv).\n\n\n \nHuman Antibodies and Humanization of Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman antibodies avoid certain of the problems associated with antibodies that possess murine or rat variable and/or constant regions. The presence of such murine or rat derived proteins can lead to the rapid clearance of the antibodies or can lead to the generation of an immune response against the antibody by a patient. In order to avoid the utilization of murine or rat derived antibodies, it has been postulated that one can develop humanized antibodies or generate fully human antibodies through the introduction of human antibody function into a rodent so that the rodent would produce antibodies having fully human sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability to clone and reconstruct megabase-sized human loci in YACs and to introduce them into the mouse germline provides a powerful approach to elucidating the functional components of very large or crudely mapped loci as well as generating useful models of human disease. Furthermore, the utilization of such technology for substitution of mouse loci with their human equivalents could provide unique insights into the expression and regulation of human gene products during development, their communication with other systems, and their involvement in disease induction and progression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn important practical application of such a strategy is the “humanization” of the mouse humoral immune system. Introduction of human immunoglobulin (Ig) loci into mice in which the endogenous Ig genes have been inactivated offers the opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying programmed expression and assembly of antibodies as well as their role in B-cell development. Furthermore, such a strategy could provide an ideal source for production of fully human monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) an important milestone towards fulfilling the promise of antibody therapy in human disease. Fully human antibodies are expected to minimize the immunogenic and allergic responses intrinsic to mouse or mouse-derivatized Mabs and thus to increase the efficacy and safety of the administered antibodies. The use of fully human antibodies can be expected to provide a substantial advantage in the treatment of chronic and recurring human diseases, such as inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer, which require repeated antibody administrations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne approach towards this goal was to engineer mouse strains deficient in mouse antibody production with large fragments of the human Ig loci in anticipation that such mice would produce a large repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of mouse antibodies. Large human Ig fragments would preserve the large variable gene diversity as well as the proper regulation of antibody production and expression. By exploiting the mouse machinery for antibody diversification and selection and the lack of immunological tolerance to human proteins, the reproduced human antibody repertoire in these mouse strains should yield high affinity antibodies against any antigen of interest, including human antigens. Using the hybridoma technology, antigen-specific human Mabs with the desired specificity could be readily produced and selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis general strategy was demonstrated in connection with our generation of the first XenoMouse™ strains as published in 1994. See Green et al. \nNature Genetics \n7:13-21 (1994). The XenoMouse™ strains were engineered with yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing 245 kb and 190 kb-sized germline configuration fragments of the human heavy chain locus and kappa light chain locus, respectively, which contained core variable and constant region sequences. Id. The human Ig containing YACs proved to be compatible with the mouse system for both rearrangement and expression of antibodies and were capable of substituting for the inactivated mouse Ig genes. This was demonstrated by their ability to induce B-cell development, to produce an adult-like human repertoire of fully human antibodies, and to generate antigen-specific human Mabs. These results also suggested that introduction of larger portions of the human Ig loci containing greater numbers of V genes, additional regulatory elements, and human Ig constant regions might recapitulate substantially the full repertoire that is characteristic of the human humoral response to infection and immunization. The work of Green et al. was recently extended to the introduction of greater than approximately 80% of the human antibody repertoire through introduction of megabase sized, germline configuration YAC fragments of the human heavy chain loci and kappa light chain loci, respectively, to produce XenoMouse™ mice.

See further Taylor et al., 1992, Chen et al., 1993, Tuaillon et al., 1993, Choi et al., 1993, Lonberg et al., (1994), Taylor et al., (1994), and Tuaillon et al., (1995), Fishwild et al., (1996), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventors of Surani et al., cited above and assigned to the Medical Research Counsel (the “MRC”), produced a transgenic mouse possessing an Ig locus through use of the minilocus approach. The inventors on the GenPharm International work, cited above, Lonberg and Kay, following the lead of the present inventors, proposed inactivation of the endogenous mouse Ig locus coupled with substantial duplication of the Surani et al. work.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn advantage of the minilocus approach is the rapidity with which constructs including portions of the Ig locus can be generated and introduced into animals. Commensurately, however, a significant disadvantage of the minilocus approach is that, in theory, insufficient diversity is introduced through the inclusion of small numbers of V, D, and J genes. Indeed, the published work appears to support this concern. B-cell development and antibody production of animals produced through use of the minilocus approach appear stunted. Therefore, research surrounding the present invention has consistently been directed towards the introduction of large portions of the Ig locus in order to achieve greater diversity and in an effort to reconstitute the immune repertoire of the animals. Human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) responses have led the industry to prepare chimeric or otherwise humanized antibodies. While chimeric antibodies have a human constant region and a murine variable region, it is expected that certain human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) responses will be observed, particularly in chronic or multi-dose utilizations of the antibody. Thus, it would be desirable to provide fully human antibodies against CTLA-4 in order to vitiate concerns and/or effects of HAMA or HACA response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHumanization and Display Technologies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs was discussed above in connection with human antibody generation, there are advantages to producing antibodies with reduced immunogenicity. To a degree, this can be accomplished in connection with techniques of humanization and display techniques using appropriate libraries. It will be appreciated that murine antibodies or antibodies from other species can be humanized or primatized using techniques well known in the art. See e.g., Winter and Harris \nImmunol Today \n14:43-46 (1993) and Wright et al. \nCrit. Reviews in Immunol. \n12125-168 (1992). The antibody of interest may be engineered by recombinant DNA techniques to substitute the CH1, CH2, CH3, hinge domains, and/or the framework domain with the corresponding human sequence (see WO 92/02190 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,530,101, 5,585,089, 5,693,761, 5,693,792, 5,714,350, and 5,777,085). Also, the use of Ig cDNA for construction of chimeric immunoglobulin genes is known in the art (Liu et al. \nP.N.A.S. \n84:3439 (1987) and \nJ. Immunol. \n139:3521 (1987)). mRNA is isolated from a hybridoma or other cell producing the antibody and used to produce cDNA. The cDNA of interest may be amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using specific primers (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195 and 4,683,202). Alternatively, a library is made and screened to isolate the sequence of interest. The DNA sequence encoding the variable region of the antibody is then fused to human constant region sequences. The sequences of human constant regions genes may be found in Kabat et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, N.I.H. publication no. 91-3242. Human C region genes are readily available from known clones. The choice of isotype will be guided by the desired effector functions, such as complement fixation, or activity in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Preferred isotypes are IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. Particularly preferred isotypes for antibodies of the invention are IgG2 and IgG4. Either of the human light chain constant regions, kappa or lambda, may be used. The chimeric, humanized antibody is then expressed by conventional methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody fragments, such as Fv, F(ab′)\n2 \nand Fab may be prepared by cleavage of the intact protein, e.g. by protease or chemical cleavage. Alternatively, a truncated gene is designed. For example, a chimeric gene encoding a portion of the F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment would include DNA sequences encoding the CH1 domain and hinge region of the H chain, followed by a translational stop codon to yield the truncated molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one approach, consensus sequences encoding the heavy and light chain J regions may be used to design oligonucleotides for use as primers to introduce useful restriction sites into the J region for subsequent linkage of V region segments to human C region segments. C region cDNA can be modified by site directed mutagenesis to place a restriction site at the analogous position in the human sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression vectors include plasmids, retroviruses, cosmids, YACs, EBV derived episomes, and the like. A convenient vector is one that encodes a functionally complete human CH or CL immunoglobulin sequence, with appropriate restriction sites engineered so that any VH or VL sequence can be easily inserted and expressed. In such vectors, splicing usually occurs between the splice donor site in the inserted J region and the splice acceptor site preceding the human C region, and also at the splice regions that occur within the human CH exons. Polyadenylation and transcription termination occur at native chromosomal sites downstream of the coding regions. The resulting chimeric antibody may be joined to any strong promoter, including retroviral LTRs, e.g. SV-40 early promoter, (Okayama et al. \nMol. Cell. Bio. \n3:280 (1983)), Rous sarcoma virus LTR (Gorman et al. \nP.N.A.S. \n79:6777 (1982)), and moloney murine leukemia virus LTR (Grosschedl et al. \nCell \n41:885 (1985)); native lg promoters, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, human antibodies or antibodies from other species can be generated through display-type technologies, including, without limitation, phage display, retroviral display, ribosomal display, and other techniques, using techniques well known in the art and the resulting molecules can be subjected to additional maturation, such as affinity maturation, as such techniques are well known in the art. Wright and Harris, supra., Hanes and Plucthau \nPNAS USA \n94:4937-4942 (1997) (ribosomal display), Parmley and Smith \nGene \n73:305-318 (1988) (phage display), Scott \nTIBS \n17:241-245 (1992), Cwirla et al. \nPNAS USA \n87:6378-6382 (1990), Russel et al. \nNucl. Acids Research \n21:1081-1085 (1993), Hoganboom et al. \nImmunol. Reviews \n130:43-68 (1992), Chiswell and McCafferty \nTIBTECH \n10:80-84 (1992), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,743. If display technologies are utilized to produce antibodies that are not human, such antibodies can be humanized as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing these techniques, antibodies can be generated to CTLA-4 expressing cells, CTLA-4 itself, forms of CTLA-4, epitopes or peptides thereof, and expression libraries thereto (see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5,703,057) which can thereafter be screened as described above for the activities described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional Criteria for Antibody Therapeutics\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be appreciated, it is generally not desirable to kill CTLA-4 expressing cells. Rather, one generally desires to simply inhibit CTLA-4 binding with its ligands to mitigate T cell down regulation. One of the major mechanisms through which antibodies kill cells is through fixation of complement and participation in CDC. The constant region of an antibody plays an important role in connection with an antibody's ability to fix complement and participate in CDC. Thus, generally one selects the isotype of an antibody to either provide the ability of complement fixation, or not. In the case of the present invention, generally, as mentioned above, it is generally not preferred to utilize an antibody that kills the cells. There are a number of isotypes of antibodies that are capable of complement fixation and CDC, including, without limitation, the following: murine IgM, murine IgG2a, murine IgG2b, murine IgG3, human IgM, human IgG1, and human IgG3. Those isotypes that do not include, without limitation, human IgG2 and human IgG4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that antibodies that are generated need not initially possess a particular desired isotype but, rather, the antibody as generated can possess any isotype and the antibody can be isotype switched thereafter using conventional techniques that are well known in the art. Such techniques include the use of direct recombinant techniques (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397), cell-cell fusion techniques (see e.g., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/730,639, filed Oct. 11, 1996), among others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the cell-cell fusion technique, a myeloma or other cell line is prepared that possesses a heavy chain with any desired isotype and another myeloma or other cell line is prepared that possesses the light chain. Such cells can, thereafter, be fused and a cell line expressing an intact antibody can be isolated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of example, the majority of the CTLA-4 antibodies discussed herein are human anti-CTLA-4 IgG2 antibody. Since such antibodies possess desired binding to the CTLA-4 molecule, any one of such antibodies can be readily isotype switched to generate a human IgG4 isotype, for example, while still possessing the same variable region (which defines the antibody's specificity and some of its affinity).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, as antibody candidates are generated that meet desired “structural” attributes as discussed above, they can generally be provided with at least certain additional “functional” attributes that are desired through isotype switching.\n\n\n \nDesign and Generation of Other Therapeutics\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention and based on the activity of the antibodies that are produced and characterized herein with respect to CTLA-4, the design of other therapeutic modalities including other antibodies, other antagonists, or chemical moieties other than antibodies is facilitated. Such modalities include, without limitation, antibodies having similar binding activity or functionality, advanced antibody therapeutics, such as bispecific antibodies, immunotoxins, and radiolabeled therapeutics, generation of peptide therapeutics, gene therapies, particularly intrabodies, antisense therapeutics, and small molecules. Furthermore, as discussed above, the effector function of the antibodies of the invention may be changed by isotype switching to an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgD, IgA, IgE, or IgM for various therapeutic uses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with the generation of advanced antibody therapeutics, where complement fixation is a desirable attribute, it may be possible to sidestep the dependence on complement for cell killing through the use of bispecifics, immunotoxins, or radiolabels, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with bispecific antibodies, bispecific antibodies can be generated that comprise (i) two antibodies one with a specificity to CTLA-4 and another to a second molecule that are conjugated together, (ii) a single antibody that has one chain specific to CTLA-4 and a second chain specific to a second molecule, or (iii) a single chain antibody that has specificity to CTLA-4 and the other molecule. Such bispecific antibodies can be generated using techniques that are well known for example, in connection with (i) and (ii) see e.g., Fanger et al. \nImmunol Methods \n4:72-81 (1994) and Wright and Harris, supra. and in connection with (iii) see e.g., Traunecker et al. \nInt. J. Cancer \n(\nSuppl.\n) 7:51-52 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, “Kappabodies” (Ill et al. “Design and construction of a hybrid immunoglobulin domain with properties of both heavy and light chain variable regions” \nProtein Eng \n10:949-57 (1997)), “Minibodies” (Martin et al. “The affinity-selection of a minibody polypeptide inhibitor of human interleukin-6\n” EMBO J \n13:5303-9 (1994)), “Diabodies” (Holliger et al. “‘Diabodies’: small bivalent and bispecific antibody fragments” \nPNAS USA \n90:6444-6448 (1993)), or “Janusins” (Traunecker et al. “Bispecific single chain molecules (Janusins) target cytotoxic lymphocytes on HIV infected cells” \nEMBO J \n10:3655-3659 (1991) and Traunecker et al. “Janusin: new molecular design for bispecific reagents” \nInt J Cancer Suppl \n7:51-52 (1992)) may also be prepared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with immunotoxins, antibodies can be modified to act as immunotoxins utilizing techniques that are well known in the art. See e.g., Vitetta \nImmunol Today \n14:252 (1993). See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,594. In connection with the preparation of radiolabeled antibodies, such modified antibodies can also be readily prepared utilizing techniques that are well known in the art. See e.g., Junghans et al. in \nCancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy \n655-686 (2d edition, Chafner and Longo, eds., Lippincott Raven (1996)). See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,681,581, 4,735,210, 5,101,827, 5,102,990 (RE 35,500), U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,648,471, and 5,697,902. Each of immunotoxins and radiolabeled molecules would be likely to kill cells expressing CTLA-4, and particularly those cells in which the antibodies of the invention are effective.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with the generation of therapeutic peptides, through the utilization of structural information related to CTLA-4 and antibodies thereto, such as the antibodies of the invention (as discussed below in connection with small molecules) or screening of peptide libraries, therapeutic peptides can be generated that are directed against CTLA-4. Design and screening of peptide therapeutics is discussed in connection with Houghten et al. \nBiotechniques \n13:412-421 (1992), Houghten \nPNAS USA \n82:5131-5135 (1985), Pinalla et al. \nBiotechniques \n13:901-905 (1992), Blake and Litzi-Davis \nBioConjugate Chem. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n3:510-513 (1992). Immunotoxins and radiolabeled molecules can also be prepared, and in a similar manner, in connection with peptidic moieties as discussed above in connection with antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImportant information related to the binding of an antibody to an antigen can be gleaned through phage display experimentation. Such experiments are generally accomplished through panning a phage library expressing random peptides for binding with the antibodies of the invention to determine if peptides can be isolated that bind. If successful, certain epitope information can be gleaned from the peptides that bind.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, phage libraries expressing random peptides can be purchased from New England Biolabs (7-mer and 12-mer libraries, Ph.D.-7 Peptide 7-mer Library Kit and Ph.D.-12 Peptide 12-mer Library Kit, respectively) based on a bacteriophage M13 system. The 7-mer library represents a diversity of approximately 2.0×10\n9 \nindependent clones, which represents most, if not all, of the 20\n7\n=1.28×10\n9 \npossible 7-mer sequences. The 12-mer library contains approximately 1.9×10\n9 \nindependent clones and represents only a very small sampling of the potential sequence space of 20\n12\n=4.1×10\n15 \n12-mer sequences. Each of 7-mer and 12-mer libraries are panned or screened in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations in which plates were coated with an antibody to capture the appropriate antibody (a goat anti-human IgG Fc for an IgG antibody for example) followed by washing. Bound phage are eluted with 0.2 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.2. After 3 rounds of selection/amplification at constant stringency (0.5% Tween), through use of DNA sequencing, one can characterize clones from the libraries that are reactive with one or more of the antibodies. Reactivity of the peptides can be determined by ELISA. For an additional discussion of epitope analysis of peptides see also Scott, J. K. and Smith, G. P. \nScience \n249:386-390 (1990); Cwirla et al. \nPNAS USA \n87:6378-6382 (1990); Felici et al. \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222:301-310 (1991), and Kuwabara et al. \nNature Biotechnology \n15:74-78 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe design of gene and/or antisense therapeutics through conventional techniques is also facilitated through the present invention. Such modalities can be utilized for modulating the function of CTLA-4. In connection therewith the antibodies of the present invention facilitate design and use of functional assays related thereto. A design and strategy for antisense therapeutics is discussed in detail in International Patent Application No. WO 94/29444. Design and strategies for gene therapy are well known. However, in particular, the use of gene therapeutic techniques involving intrabodies could prove to be particularly advantageous. See e.g., Chen et al. \nHuman Gene Therapy \n5:595-601 (1994) and Marasco \nGene Therapy \n4:11-15 (1997). General design of and considerations related to gene therapeutics is also discussed in International Patent Application No. WO 97/38137. Genetic materials encoding an antibody of the invention (such as the 4.1.1, 4.8.1, or 6.1.1, or others) may be included in a suitable expression system (whether viral, attenuated viral, non-viral, naked, or otherwise) and administered to a host for in vivo generation of the antibody in the host.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSmall molecule therapeutics can also be envisioned in accordance with the present invention. Drugs can be designed to modulate the activity of CTLA-4 based upon the present invention. Knowledge gleaned from the structure of the CTLA-4 molecule and its interactions with other molecules in accordance with the present invention, such as the antibodies of the invention, CD28, B7, B7-1, B7-2, and others can be utilized to rationally design additional therapeutic modalities. In this regard, rational drug design techniques such as X-ray crystallography, computer-aided (or assisted) molecular modeling (CAMM), quantitative or qualitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), and similar technologies can be utilized to focus drug discovery efforts. Rational design allows prediction of protein or synthetic structures which can interact with the molecule or specific forms thereof which can be used to modify or modulate the activity of CTLA-4. Such structures can be synthesized chemically or expressed in biological systems. This approach has been reviewed in Capsey et al. \nGenetically Engineered Human Therapeutic Drugs \n(Stockton Press, NY (1988)). Indeed, the rational design of molecules (either peptides, peptidomimetics, small molecules, or the like) based upon known, or delineated, structure-activity relationships with other molecules (such as antibodies in accordance with the invention) has become generally routine. See, e.g., Fry et al. “Specific, irreversible inactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and erbB2, by a new class of tyrosine kinase inhibitor” \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n95:12022-7 (1998); Hoffman et al. “A model of Cdc25 phosphatase catalytic domain and Cdk-interaction surface based on the presence of a rhodanese homology domain” \nJ Mol Biol \n282:195-208 (1998); Ginaiski et al. “Modelling of active forms of protein kinases: p38—a case study” \nActa Biochim Pol \n44:557-64 (1997); Jouko et al. “Identification of csk tyrosine phosphorylation sites and a tyrosine residue important for kinase domain structure” \nBiochem J\n322:927-35 (1997); Singh et al. “Structure-based design of a potent, selective, and irreversible inhibitor of the catalytic domain of the erbB receptor subfamily of protein tyrosine kinases” \nJ Med Chem \n40:1130-5 (1997); Mandel et al. “ABGEN: a knowledge-based automated approach for antibody structure modeling” \nNat Biotechnol \n14:323-8 (1996); Monfardini et al. “Rational design, analysis, and potential utility of GM-CSF antagonists” \nProc Assoc Am Physicians \n108:420-31 (1996); Furet et al. “Modelling study of protein kinase inhibitors: binding mode of staurosporine and origin of the selectivity of CGP 52411” \nJ Comput Aided Mol Des \n9:465-72 (1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, combinatorial libraries can be designed and sythesized and used in screening programs, such as high throughput screening efforts.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Administration and Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that administration of therapeutic entities in accordance with the invention will be administered with suitable carriers, excipients, and other agents that are incorporated into formulations to provide improved transfer, delivery, tolerance, and the like. A multitude of appropriate formulations can be found in the formulary known to all pharmaceutical chemists: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (15\nth \ned, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. (1975)), particularly Chapter 87 by Blaug, Seymour, therein. These formulations include, for example, powders, pastes, ointments, jellies, waxes, oils, lipids, lipid (cationic or anionic) containing vesicles (such as Lipofectin™), DNA conjugates, anhydrous absorption pastes, oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, emulsions carbowax (polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights), semi-solid gels, and semi-solid mixtures containing carbowax. Any of the foregoing mixtures may be appropriate in treatments and therapies in accordance with the present invention, provided that the active ingredient in the formulation is not inactivated by the formulation and the formulation is physiologically compatible and tolerable with the route of administration. See also Powell et al. “Compendium of excipients for parenteral formulations” \nPDA J Pharm Sci Technol. \n52:238-311 (1998) and the citations therein for additional information related to excipients and carriers well known to pharmaceutical chemists.\n\n\n \nPreparation of Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies in accordance with the invention are preferably prepared through the utilization of a transgenic mouse that has a substantial portion of the human antibody producing genome inserted but that is rendered deficient in the production of endogenous, murine, antibodies. Such mice, then, are capable of producing human immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies and are deficient in the production of murine immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies. Technologies utilized for achieving the same are disclosed in the patents, applications, and references disclosed in the Background, herein. In particular, however, a preferred embodiment of transgenic production of mice and antibodies therefrom is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/759,620, filed Dec. 3, 1996, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. See also Mendez et al. \nNature Genetics \n15:146-156 (1997), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Through use of such technology, we have produced fully human monoclonal antibodies to a variety of antigens. Essentially, we immunize XenoMouse™ lines of mice with an antigen of interest, recover lymphatic cells (such as B-cells) from the mice that express antibodies, fuse such recovered cells with a myeloid-type cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines, and such hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. We utilized these techniques in accordance with the present invention for the preparation of antibodies specific to CTLA-4. Herein, we describe the production of multiple hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies specific to CTLA-4. Further, we provide a characterization of the antibodies produced by such cell lines, including nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses of the heavy and light chains of such antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies derived from hybridoma cell lines discussed herein are designated 3.1.1, 4.1.1, 4.8.1, 4.10.2, 4.13.1, 4.14.3, 6.1.1, 11.2.1, 11.6.1, 11.7.1, 12.3.1.1, and 12.9.1.1. Each of the antibodies produced by the aforementioned cell lines are either fully human IgG2 or IgG4 heavy chains with human kappa light chains. In general, antibodies in accordance with the invention possess very high affinities, typically possessing Kd's of from about 10\n−9 \nthrough about 10\n−11 \nM, when measured by either solid phase or solution phase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be appreciated, antibodies in accordance with the present invention can be expressed in cell lines other than hybridoma cell lines. Sequences encoding the cDNAs or genomic clones for the particular antibodies can be used for transformation of a suitable mammalian or nonmammalian host cells. Transformation can be by any known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell, including, for example packaging the polynucleotide in a virus (or into a viral vector) and transducing a host cell with the virus (or vector) or by transfection procedures known in the art, as exemplified by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,216, 4,912,040, 4,740,461, and 4,959,455 (which patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference). The transformation procedure used depends upon the host to be transformed. Methods for introduction of heterologous polynucleotides into mammalian cells are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, particle bombardment, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, peptide conjugates, dendrimers, and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known in the art and include many immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), including but not limited to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, NSO\n0\n, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), and a number of other cell lines. Non-mammalian cells including but not limited to bacterial, yeast, insect, and plants can also be used to express recombinant antibodies. Site directed mutagenesis of the antibody CH2 domain to eliminate glycosylation may be preferred in order to prevent changes in either the immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic, and/or effector functions resulting from non-human glycosylation. The expression methods are selected by determining which system generates the highest expression levels and produce antibodies with constitutive CTLA-4 binding properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, expression of antibodies of the invention (or other moieties therefrom) from production cell lines can be enhanced using a number of known techniques. For example, the glutamine sythetase and DHFR gene expression systems are common approaches for enhancing expression under certain conditions. High expressing cell clones can be identified using conventional techniques, such as limited dilution cloning and Microdrop technology. The GS system is discussed in whole or part in connection with European Patent Nos. 0 216 846, 0 256 055, and 0 323 997 and European Patent Application No. 89303964.4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the invention can also be produced transgenically through the generation of a mammal or plant that is transgenic for the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain sequences of interest and production of the antibody in a recoverable form therefrom. In connection with the transgenic production in mammals, antibodies can be produced in, and recovered from, the milk of goats, cows, or other mammals. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,827,690, 5,756,687, 5,750,172, and 5,741,957.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies in accordance with the present invention have been analyzed structurally and functionally. In connection with the structures of the antibodies, amino acid sequences of the heavy and kappa light chains have been predicted based on cDNA sequences obtained through RT-PCR of the hybridomas. See Examples 3 and 4 and \nFIGS. 1-8\n. N-terminal sequencing of the antibodies was also conducted in confirmation of the results discussed in Examples 3 and 4. See Example 5 and \nFIG. 9\n. Kinetic analyses of the antibodies were conducted to determine affinities. See Example 2. Antibodies in accordance with the invention (and particularly the 4.1.1, 4.8.1, and 6.1.1 antibodies of the invention) have high affinities (4.1.1:1.63×10\n10 \n1/M; 4.8.1:3.54×10\n10 \n1/M; and 6.1.1:7.2×10\n9 \n1/M). Further, antibodies were analyzed by isoelectric focusing (IEF), reducing gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), size exclusion chromatography, liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy and antibody production by the hybridomas was assessed. See Example 6 and \nFIG. 10\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with functional analysis of antibodies in accordance with the present invention, such antibodies proved to be potent inhibitors of CTLA-4 and its binding to its ligands of the B7 family of molecules. For example, antibodies in accordance with the present invention were demonstrated to block CTLA-4 binding to either B7-1 or B7-2. See Example 7. Indeed, many of the antibodies in accordance with the invention possess nanomolar and subnanomolar IC\n5o\ns with respect to inhibiting CTLA-4 binding to B7-1 and B7-2. Further, antibodies of the invention possess excellent selectivity for CTLA-4 as compared to CD28, CD44, B7-2, or hIgG1. See Example 8. Selectivity is a ratio that reflects the degree of preferential binding of a molecule with a first agent as compared to the molecules binding with a second, and optionally other molecules. Herein, selectivity refers to the degree of preferential binding of an antibody of the invention to CTLA-4 as compared to the antibody's binding to other molecules such as CD28, CD44, B7-2, or hIgG1. Selectivity values of antibodies of the invention greater than 500:1 are common. Antibodies of the invention have also been demonstrated to induce or enhance expression of certain cytokines (such as IL-2 and IFN-γ) by cultured T cells in a T cell blast model. See Examples 9 and 10 and \nFIGS. 12-17\n. Further, it is expected that antibodies of the invention will inhibit the growth of tumors in appropriate in vivo tumor models. The design of which models are discussed in Example 11 and 12.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results demonstrated in accordance with the present invention indicate that antibodies of the present invention possess certain qualities that may make the present antibodies more efficacious than current therapeutic antibodies against CTLA-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the 4.1.1, 4.8.1, and 6.1.1 antibodies of the invention possess highly desirable properties. Their structural characteristics, functions, or activities provide criteria that facilitate the design or selection of additional antibodies or other molecules as discussed above. Such criteria include one or more of the following:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAbility to compete for binding to CTLA-4 with one or more of the antibodies of the invention;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar binding specificity to CTLA-4 as one or more of the antibodies of the invention; A binding affinity for CTLA-4 of about 10\n−9 \nM or greater and preferably of about 10\n−10 \nM or greater;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDoes not cross react with lower mammalian CTLA-4, including, preferably, mouse, rat, or rabbit and preferably mouse or rat CTLA-4;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCross reacts with primate CTLA-4, including, preferably, cynomolgous and rhesus CTLA-4;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA selectivity for CTLA-4 over CD28, B7-2, CD44, or hIgG1 of at least about 100:1 or greater and preferably of about 300, 400, or 500:1 or greater;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn IC\n50 \nin blocking CTLA-4 binding to B7-2 of about 100 nM or lower and preferably 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.5, or 0.38 nM or lower;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn IC\n50 \nin blocking CTLA-4 binding to B7-1 of about of about 100 nM or lower and preferably 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.5, or 0.50 nM or lower;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn enhancement of cytokine production in one or more in vitro assays, for example:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn enhancement of IL-2 production in a T cell blast/Raji assay of about 500 pg/ml or greater and preferably 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, or 3846 pg/ml or greater;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn enhancement of IFN-γ production in a T cell blast/Raji assay of about 500 pg/ml or greater and preferably 750, 1000, or 1233 pg/ml or greater; or\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn enhancement of IL-2 production in a hPBMC or whole blood superantigen assay of about 500 pg/ml or greater and preferably 750, 1000, 1200, or 1511 pg/ml or greater. Expressed another way, it is desirable that IL-2 production is enhanced by about 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 percent or more relative to control in the assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is expected that antibodies (or molecules designed or synthesized therefrom) having one or more of these properties will possess similar efficacy to the antibodies described in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe desirable functional properties discussed above can often result from binding to and inhibition of CTLA4 by a molecule (i.e., antibody, antibody fragment, peptide, or small molecule) in a similar manner as an antibody of the invention (i.e., binding to the same or similar epitope of the CTLA4 molecule). The molecule may either be administered directly (i.e., direct administration to a patient of such molecules). Or, alternatively, the molecule may be “administered” indirectly (i.e., a peptide or the like that produces an immune response in a patient (similar to a vaccine) wherein the immune response includes the generation of antibodies that bind to the same or similar epitope or an antibody or fragment that is produced in situ after administration of genetic materials that encode such antibodies or fragments thereof which bind to the same or similar epitope). Thus, it will be appreciated that the epitope on CTLA4 to which antibodies of the invention bind to can be useful in connection with the preparation and/or design of therapeutics in accordance with the invention. In drug design, negative information is often useful as well (i.e., the fact that an antibody which binds to CTLA4 does not appear to bind to an epitope that acts as an inhibitor of CTLA4 is useful). Thus, the epitope to which antibodies of the invention bind that do not lead to the desired functionality can also be very useful. Accordingly, also contemplated in accordance with the present invention are molecules (and particularly antibodies) that bind to the same or similar epitopes as antibodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the fact that antibodies of the invention and the epitopes to which they bind are contemplated in accordance with the invention, we have conducted some preliminary epitope mapping studies of certain antibodies in accordance with the invention and particularly the 4.1.1 and the 11.2.1 antibodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a first step, we conducted BIAcore competition studies to generate a rough map of binding as between certain antibodies of the invention in connection with their ability to compete for binding to CTLA4. To this end, CTLA4 was bound to a BIAcore chip and a first antibody, under saturating conditions, was bound thereto and competition of subsequent secondary antibodies binding to CTLA4 was measured. This technique enabled generation of a rough map in to which families of antibodies can be classified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThrough this process, we determined that the certain antibodies in accordance with the invention could be categorized as falling into the following epitopic categories:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\n\n\nAntibodies\n\n\nCompetition for CTLA4 Binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\nBO1M*\n\n\nFreely cross-compete with one another; cross-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBO2M**\n\n\ncompete with category B; some cross-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ncompetition with category D\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n4.1.1\n\n\nFreely cross-compete with one another; cross-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4.13.1\n\n\ncompete with category A, C and D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n6.1.1\n\n\nFreely cross-compete with one another; cross-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.1.1\n\n\ncompete with category B and category D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4.8.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11.2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11.6.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11.7.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n4.14.3\n\n\nCross-compete with category C and B; some\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ncross-competition with category A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n4.9.1\n\n\nBNI3 blocks 4.9.1 binding to CTLA4 but not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBNI3***\n\n\nthe reverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Available from Biostride.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***Available from Pharmingen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a next step, we endeavored to determine if the antibodies of the invention recognized a linear epitope on CTLA4 under reducing and non-reducing conditions on Western blots. We observed that none of the 4.1.1, 3.1.1, 11.7.1, 11.6.1, or 11.2.1 antibodies of the invention appeared to recognize a reduced form of CTLA4 on Western blot. Accordingly, it appeared likely that the epitope to which each of these antibodies bound was not a linear epitope but more likely was a conformational epitope the structure of which may have been abrogated under reducing conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, we sought to determine whether we could learn about residues within the CTLA4 molecule that are important for binding of antibodies of the invention. One manner that we utilized was to conduct kinetic assessments of off-rates as between human CTLA4 and two highly conserved primate CTLA4 molecules (cynomologous and marmoset CTLA4). BIAcore studies demonstrated that the 4.1.1 antibody of the invention bound to human, cynomologous, and marmoset CTLA4 at the same rate. However, with respect to off-rates (affinity), the 4.1.1 antibody had the highest affinity (slowest off-rate) for human, a faster off-rate with cynomologous, and a much faster off-rate for marmoset. The 11.2.1 antibody of the invention, on the other hand, binds to human, cynomologous, and marmoset CTLA4 at the about the same rate and has about the same relative off-rate for each of the three. This information further indicates that the 4.1.1 and 11.2.1 antibodies of the invention bind to different epitopes on CTLA4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo further study the epitope to which the category B and C antibodies of the invention bind, we conducted certain site directed mutagenesis studies. Marmoset CTLA4 possesses two important changes at residues 105 and 106 relative to human CTLA4. Such differences are a leucine to methionine change at residue 105 and a glycine to serine change at residue 106. Accordingly, we mutated cDNA encoding human CTLA4 to encode a mutated CTLA4 having the L105M and G106S changes. The homologue replacement mutant CTLA4 did not effect binding of a B7.2-IgG1 fusion protein. Further, binding with the 11.2.1 antibody of the invention was not effected. However, such molecule was significantly inhibited in its ability to bind with the 4.1.1 antibody of the invention (similar to marmoset). Next, we mutated a cDNA encoding marmoset CTLA4 to create a mutant marmoset CTLA4 having a S106G change. Such change resulted in restoration of stable binding between the 4.1.1 antibody and the marmoset CTLA4 mutant. In addition, we mutated a cDNA encoding marmoset CTLA4 to create a mutant marmoset CTLA4 having a M105L change. Such change partially restored binding between the 4.1.1 antibody and the mutant CTLA4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the category B through D antibodies of the invention appear to possess similar functional properties and appear to have the potential to act as strong anti-CTLA4 therapeutic agents. Further, each of the molecules certain cross-competition in their binding for CTLA4. However, as will be observed from the above discussion, each of the molecules in the different categories appear to bind to separate conformational epitopes on CTLA4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the epitope information discussed above indicates that antibodies (or other molecules, as discussed above) that cross-compete with antibodies of the invention will likely have certain therapeutic potential in accordance with the present invention. Further, it is expected that antibodies (or other molecules, as discussed above) that cross-compete with antibodies of the invention (i.e., cross-compete with category B, C and/or D antibodies) will likely have certain additional therapeutic potential in accordance with the present invention. Additionally, it is expected that antibodies (or other molecules, as discussed above) that cross-compete with antibodies of the invention (i.e., cross-compete with category B, C and/or D antibodies) and that (i) are not reduced in their binding to marmoset CTLA4 (similar to the 11.2.1 antibody) or (ii) are reduced in their binding to marmoset CTLA4 (similar to the 4.1.1 antibody) will likely have certain additional therapeutic potential in accordance with the present invention. Antibodies (or other molecules, as discussed above) that compete with categories A and E may also have certain therapeutic potential.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples, including the experiments conducted and results achieved are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting upon the present invention.\n\n\n \nExample 1 \n\n\nGeneration of Anti-CTLA-4-Antibody Producing Hybridomas\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies of the invention were prepared, selected, and assayed in accordance with the present Example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen Preparation: Three distinct immunogens were prepared for immunization of the XenoMouse™ mice: (i) a CTLA-4-IgG fusion protein, (ii) a CTLA-4 peptide, and (iii) 300.19 murine lymphoma cells transfected with a mutant of CTLA-4 (Y201V) that is constitutively expressed on the cell surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) CTLA-4-IgG1 Fusion Protein:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression Vector Construction:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cDNA encoding the mature extracellular domain of CTLA-4 was PCR amplified from human thymus cDNA library (Clontech) using primers designed to published sequence (\nEur.

The fragment was directionally subcloned into pSR5, a Sindbis virus expression plasmid (InVitrogen), between the human oncostatin M signal peptide and human IgG gamma 1 (IgG1) CH1/CH2/CH3 domains. The fusion protein does not contain a hinge domain but contains cysteine 120 in the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 to form a covalent dimer. The resulting vector was called CTLA-4-IgG1/pSR5. The complete CTLA-4-IgG1 cDNA in the vector was sequence confirmed in both strands. The amino acid sequence the CTLA4-Ig protein is shown below. The mature extracellular domain for CD44 was PCR amplified from human lymphocyte library (Clontech) and subcloned into pSinRep5 to generate a control protein with the identical IgG1 tail.\n\n\n \nOM-CTLA4-IgG1 Fusion Protein:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMGVLLTQRTLLSLVLALLFPSM\nASM\nAMHVAQPAVVLASSRGIASFVC\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEYASPGKATEVRVTVLRQADSQVTEVCAATYMMGNELTFLDDSICT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGTSSGNQVNLTIQGLRAMDTGLYICKVELMYPPPYYLGIGNGTQIY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nVIDPEPCPDSD\nLEGAPSVFLFPPKPKDTLMISRTPEVTCVVVDVSHED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPEVKFNWYVDGVEVHNAKTKPREEQYNSTYRVVSVLTVLHQDWLNGKE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYKCKVSNKALPTPIEKTISKAKGQPREPQVYTLPPSRDELTKNQVSLT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLVKGFYPSDIAVEWESNGQPENNYKTTPPVLDSDGSFFLYSKLTVDK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSRWQQGNVFSCSVMHEALHNHYTQKSLSLSPGK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nUnderlined: Signal Peptide\n\n\nBold: CTLA4 Extracellular Domain\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cDNAs for mature extracellular domain of CD28 were PCR amplified from human lymphocyte library (Clontech) and then subcloned into pCDM8 (\nJ. Immunol. \n151: 5261-71 (1993)) to produce a human IgG1 fusion protein containing both thrombin cleavage and hinge regions. Marmoset, Cynomologous, and Rhesus CTLA4 were cloned from mRNA isolated from PHA stimulated PBMCs using standard techniques of degenerate PCR. Sequencing demonstrated that rhesus and cynomologous amino acid sequence were identical with three differences from mature human CTLA4 extracellular domain (S13N, I17T and L105M). Marmoset demonstrated ten amino acid differences from the mature human CTLA4 extracellular domain (V21A, V33I, A41T, A51G, 541, S71F, Q75K, T88M, L105M and G106S). Site directed mutagenesis was used to make single point mutations of all amino acids different in marmoset CTLA4 to map amino acids important for interation of the antibodies with human CTLA4-IgG. Mutations of human and marmoset CTLA-IgG for epitope mapping were generated by matchmaker site-directed mutagenesis (Promega). The IgG fusion proteins were produced by transient transfection of Cos7 cells and purified using standard Protein A techniques. Mutant CTLA4-IgG proteins were evaluated for binding to antibodies by immunoblotting and using BIAcore analyses.\n\n\n \nRecombinant Protein Expression/Purification:\n\n\n \n \n \nRecombinant sindbis virus was generated by electroporating (Gibco) Baby Hamster Kidney cells with SP6 in vitro transcribed CTLA-4-IgG1/pSR5 mRNA and DH-26S helper mRNA as described by InVitrogen. Forty eight hours later recombinant virus was harvested and titered for optimal protein expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1). CHO-K1 cells were cultured in suspension in DMEM/F12 (Gibco) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco), non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 4 mM glutamine (Gibco), penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), 10 mM Hepes pH 7.5 (Gibco). To produce CTLA-4-IgG, the CHO-K1 cells were resuspended at 1×10\n7 \ncells/ml in DMEM/F12 and incubated with sindbis virus for one hour at room temperature. Cells were then diluted to 1×10\n6\n/ml in DMEM/F12 containing 1% fetal bovine serum depleted of bovine IgG using protein A sepharose (Pharmacia), non-essential amino acids, 4 mM glutamine, 12.5 mM Hepes pH 7.5, and penicillin/streptomycin. Forty eight hours post-infection cells were pelleted and conditioned media was harvested and supplemented with complete protease inhibitor tablets (Boehringer Mannheim), pH adjusted to 7.5, and filtered 0.2μ (Nalgene). FPLC (Pharmacia) was used to affinity purify the fusion protein using a 5 ml protein A HiTrap column (Pharmacia) at a 10 ml/min flow rate. The column was washed with 30 bed volumes of PBS and eluted with 0.1M glycine/HCl pH 2.8 at 1 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were immediately neutralized to pH 7.5 with \nTris pH\n 9. The fractions containing CTLA-4-IgG1 were identified by SDS-PAGE and then concentrated using centriplus 50 (Amicon) before applying to \nsepharose\n 200 column (Pharmacia) at 1 ml/min using PBS as the solvent. Fractions containing CTLA-4-IgG1 were pooled, sterile filtered 0.2μ (Millipore), aliquoted and frozen at −80° C. CD44-IgG1 was expressed and purified using the same methods. CD28-IgG was purified from conditioned media from transiently transfected Cos7 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCharacterization CTLA-4-IgG1:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe purified CTLA-4-IgG1 migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE using colloidal coomassie staining (Novex). Under non-reducing conditions CTLA-4-IgG1 was a dimer (100 kDa), that reduced to a 50 kDa monomer when treated with 50 mM DTT. Amino acid sequencing of the purified CTLA-4-IgG1 in solution confirmed the N-terminus of CTLA-4 (MHVAQPAVVLAS), and that the oncostatin-M signal peptide was cleaved from the mature fusion protein. The CTLA-4-IgG1 bound to immobilized B7.1-IgG in a concentration dependent manner and the binding was blocked by a hamster-anti-human anti-CTLA-4 antibody (BNI3: PharMingen). The sterile CTLA-4-IgG was endotoxin free and quantitated by OD280 using 1.4 as the extinction coefficient. The yield of purified CTLA-4-IgG ranged between 0.5-3mgs/liter of CHO-K1 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ii) CTLA-4 Peptide:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following CTLA-4 peptide was prepared as described below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNH\n2\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMHVAQPAVVLASSRGIASFVCEYASPGKATEVRVTVLRQADSQVT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVCAATYMMGNELTFLDDSICTGTSSGNQVNLTIQGLRAMDTGLYICK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVELMYPPPYYLGIGNGTQIYVIDPEPC-CONH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAbbreviations/Materials:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNMP, N-Methylpyrrolidinone; TFE, 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol; DCM, Dichloromethane; FMOC, Fluorenyl Methoxycarbonyl. All reagents were supplied by Perkin Elmer, with the following exceptions: TFE, Aldrich Chemical, FMOC-PAL-PEG resin, Perseptive Biosystems. Fmoc-Arg(PMC)-OH, FMOC-Asn(Trt)-OH, FMOC-Asp(tBu)-OH, FMOC-Cys(Trt)-OH, FMOC-Glu(tBu)-OH, FMOC-Gln(Trt)-OH, FMOC-His(Boc)-OH, FMOC-Lys(BOC)-OH, FMOC-Ser(tBu)-OH, FMOC-Thr(tBu)-OH and FMOC-Tyr(tBu)-OH were used for those amino acids requiring side chain protecting groups\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide Synthesis:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide synthesis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer 431A, retrofitted with feedback monitoring via UV absorbance at 301 nm (Perkin-Elmer Model 759A detector).

Forced double couplings were performed at \n \n \n \n \n \ncycles\n \n \n \n \n \n 10,11,18,19,20 and 28 through 33. The resin was washed with a 50% mixture of DCM and TFE at the completion of each acylation cycle, followed by capping of unreacted amino groups with acetic anhydride in NMP. Resin was removed from the reactor after completing \ncycle\n 49 and the remainder continued to completion. Peptide cleavage from the resin was performed using Reagent K (King et al. \nInternational Journal of Protein and Peptide Research \n36:255-266 (1990)) for 6 hours on 415 mg of resin affording 186 mg crude CTLA-4 peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide Characterization:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n25 mg aliquots of the crude CTLA-4 peptide were dissolved in 5 ml 6M Guanidine HCl/100 mM K\n2\nPO\n3 \nat pH6.4 and eluted over a Pharmacia \nHi Load Superdex\n 75 16/60 column (16 mm×600 mm, 120 ml bed volume) with 2M Guanidine.HCl/100 mM K\n2\nPO\n3 \nat pH6.4 at 2 ml/min for 180 minutes collecting 5 ml fractions. The fractions were analyzed by loading 1.7 μl of fractions onto a NuPAGE Laemeli gel running with MES running buffer and visualizing via Daichii silver stain protocol. Those fractions exhibiting a molecular weight of 12 KDa, as judged versus molecular weight standards, were pooled together and stored at 4° C. The combined fractions were analyzed by UV and gel electrophoresis. Amino acid sequencing was performed by absorbing a 100 microliter sample in a ProSorb cartridge (absorbed onto a PVDF membrane) and washing to remove the buffer salts. Sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 420. The expected N-terminal sequence (M H V A Q P A V V L A) was observed. Immunoblotting demonstrated that the peptide was recognized by the BNI3 anti-human CTLA-4 (PharMingen). To desalt, an aliquot containing 648 μg of material was placed in 3500 Da MWCO dialysis tubing and dialyzed against 0.1% TFA/H\n2\nO at 4° C. for 9 days with stirring. The entire contents of the dialysis bag was lyophilyzed to a powder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(iii) 300.19 Cells Transfected with CTLA-4 (Y201V)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe full length CTLA-4 cDNA was PCR amplified from human thymus cDNA library (Stratagene) and subcloned into pIRESneo (Clontech). A mutation of CTLA-4 that results in constitutive cell surface expression was introduced using MatchMaker Mutagenesis System (Promega). Mutation of tyrosine, Y201 to valine inhibits binding of the adaptin protein AP50 that is responsible for the rapid internalization of CTLA-4 (Chuang et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n159:144-151 (1997)). Mycoplasma-free 300.19 murine lymphoma cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, non-essential amino acids, penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 12.5 mM Hepes pH 7.5, and 25 uM beta-mercaptoethanol. Cells were electroporated (3×10\n6\n/0.4 ml serum free RPMI) in a 1 ml chamber with 20 ug CTLA-4-Y201V/pIRESneo using 200V/1180 uF (Gibco CellPorator). Cells were rested for 10 minutes and then 8 mls of prewarmed complete RPMI media. At 48 hours cells were diluted to 0.5×10\n6\n/ml in complete RPMI media containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Gibco). Resistant cells were expanded and shown to express CTLA-4 on the cell surface using the BNI3 antibody conjugated with phycoerythrin (PharMingen). High level expressing cells were isolated by sterile sorting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunization and hybridoma generation: XenoMouse mice (8 to 10 weeks old) were immunized (i) subcutaneously at the base of tails with 1×10\n7 \n300.19 cells that were transfected to express CTLA-4 as described above, resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with complete Freund's adjuvant, or (ii) subcutaneously at the base of tail with (a) 10 μg the CTLA-4 fusion protein or (b) 10 μg CTLA-4 peptide, emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant. In each case, the dose was repeated three or four times in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Four days before fusion, the mice received a final injection of the immunogen or cells in PBS. Spleen and/or lymph node lymphocytes from immunized mice were fused with the [murine non-secretory myeloma P3 cell line] and were subjected to HAT selection as previously described (Galfre, G. and Milstein, C., “Preparation of monoclonal antibodies: strategies and procedures.” \nMethods Enzymol. \n73:3-46 (1981)). A large panel of hybridomas all secreting CTLA-4 specific human IgG\n2\nκ or IgG\n4\nκ (as detected below) antibodies were recovered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nELISA assay: ELISA for determination of antigen-specific antibodies in mouse serum and in hybridoma supernatants was carried out as described (Coligan et al., Unit 2.1, “Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays,” in \nCurrent protocols in immunology \n(1994)) using CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein to capture the antibodies. For animals that are immunized with the CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein, we additionally screen for non-specific reactivity against the human Ig portion of the fusion protein. This is accomplished using ELISA plates coated with human IgG1 as a negative control for specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred ELISA assay, the following techniques are used:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nELISA plates are coated with 100 μl/well of the antigen in plate coating buffer (0.1 M Carbonate Buffer, pH 9.6 and NaHCO\n3 \n(MW 84) 8.4 g/L). Plates are then incubated at 4° C. overnight. After incubation, coating buffer is removed and the plate is blocked with 200 μl/well blocking buffer (0.5% BSA, 0.1\n% Tween\n 20, 0.01% Thimerosal in lx PBS) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Alternatively, the plates are stored in refrigerator with blocking buffer and plate sealers. Blocking buffer is removed and 50 μl/well of hybridoma supernatant, serum or other hybridoma supernatant (positive control) and HAT media or blocking buffer (negative control) is added. The plates are incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. After incubation, the plate is washed with washing buffer (1× PBS). The detecting antibody (i.e., mouse anti-human IgG2-HRP (SB, #9070-05) for IgG2 antibodies or mouse anti-human IgG4-HRP (SB #9200-05) for IgG4 antibodies) is added at 100 μl/well (mouse anti-human IgG2-HRP @1:2000 or mouse anti-human IgG4-HRP @1:1000 (each diluted in blocking buffer)). The plates are incubated at room temperature for 1 hour and then washed with washing buffer. Thereafter, 100 μl/well of freshly prepared developing solution (10 ml Substrate buffer, 5 mg OPD (o-phenylenediamine, Sigma Cat No. P-7288), and 10 \nμl\n 30% H\n2\nO\n2 \n(Sigma)) is added to the wells. The plates are allowed to develop 10-20 minutes, until negative control wells barely start to show color. Thereafter, 100 μl/well of stop solution (2 M H\n2\nSO\n4\n) is added and the plates are read on an ELISA plate reader at \nwavelength\n 490 nm.\n\n\n \nDetermination of Affinity Constants of Fully Human Mabs by BIAcore:\n\n\n \n \n \nAffinity measurement of purified human monoclonal antibodies, Fab fragments, or hybridoma supernatants by plasmon resonance was carried out using the \nBIAcore\n 2000 instrument, using general procedures outlined by the manufacturers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKinetic analysis of the antibodies was carried out using antigens immobilized onto the sensor surface at a low density. Three surfaces of the BIAcore sensorchip were immobililized with the CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein at a density ranging from approximately 390-900 using CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein at 20 or 50 μg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate at pH 5.0 using the amine coupling kit supplied by the manufacturer (BIAcore, Inc.). The fourth surface of the BIAcore sensorchip was immobilized with IgG1 (900 RU) and was used as a negative control surface for non-specific binding. Kinetic analysis was performed at a flow rate of 25 or 50 microliters per minute and dissociation (kd or k\noff\n) and association (ka or k\non\n) rates were determined using the software provided by the manufacturer (BIA evaluation 3.0) that allows for global fitting calculations.\n\n\n \nExample 2 \n\n\nAffinity Measurement of Anti-CTLA-4-Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the following Table, affinity measurements for certain of the antibodies selected in this manner are provided:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSolid Phase (by BIAcore)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAssociation\n\n\nDissociation\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOn-rates\n\n\nOff-rates\n\n\nConstant\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nK\na\n \n\n\nK\nd\n \n\n\nKA (1/M) =\n\n\nKD(M) =\n\n\nSurface\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHybrid-\n\n\n(M\n−1\nS\n−1 \n×\n\n\n(S\n−1 \n×\n\n\nk\na\n/k\nd \n×\n\n\nK\nd\n/k\na \n×\n\n\nDensity\n\n\n\n\n\n\noma\n\n\n10\n6\n)\n\n\n10\n−4\n)\n\n\n10\n10\n \n\n\n10\n−10\n \n\n\n[RU]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoab01\n\n\n0.68\n\n\n1.01\n\n\n0.67\n\n\n1.48\n\n\n878.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.70\n\n\n4.66\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n6.68\n\n\n504.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.77\n\n\n6.49\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n8.41\n\n\n457.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.60\n\n\n3.08\n\n\n0.20\n\n\n5.11\n\n\n397.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.1\n\n\n1.85\n\n\n0.72\n\n\n2.58\n\n\n0.39\n\n\n878.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.88\n\n\n1.21\n\n\n1.55\n\n\n0.64\n\n\n504.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.73\n\n\n1.54\n\n\n1.13\n\n\n0.88\n\n\n457.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.86\n\n\n1.47\n\n\n1.26\n\n\n0.79\n\n\n397.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.8.1\n\n\n0.32\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n4.46\n\n\n0.22\n\n\n878.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.31\n\n\n0.23\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n0.75\n\n\n504.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.28\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n4.82\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n397.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.14.3\n\n\n2.81\n\n\n3.04\n\n\n0.92\n\n\n1.08\n\n\n878.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2.88\n\n\n3.97\n\n\n0.73\n\n\n1.38\n\n\n504.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2.84\n\n\n6.66\n\n\n0.43\n\n\n2.35\n\n\n457.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.17\n\n\n5.03\n\n\n0.63\n\n\n1.58\n\n\n397.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.1\n\n\n0.43\n\n\n0.35\n\n\n1.21\n\n\n0.83\n\n\n878.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.46\n\n\n0.90\n\n\n0.51\n\n\n1.98\n\n\n504.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.31\n\n\n0.51\n\n\n0.61\n\n\n1.63\n\n\n457.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.45\n\n\n0.79\n\n\n0.57\n\n\n1.76\n\n\n397.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1\n\n\n1.04\n\n\n0.96\n\n\n1.07\n\n\n0.93\n\n\n878.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.95\n\n\n1.72\n\n\n0.55\n\n\n1.82\n\n\n504.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.73\n\n\n1.65\n\n\n0.44\n\n\n2.27\n\n\n457.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.91\n\n\n2.07\n\n\n0.44\n\n\n2.28\n\n\n397.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.9.1\n\n\n1.55\n\n\n13.80\n\n\n0.11\n\n\n8.94\n\n\n878.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.43\n\n\n19.00\n\n\n0.08\n\n\n13.20\n\n\n504.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.35\n\n\n20.50\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n15.20\n\n\n397.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.10.2\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n2.53\n\n\n0.39\n\n\n2.54\n\n\n878.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.94\n\n\n4.30\n\n\n0.22\n\n\n4.55\n\n\n504.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.70\n\n\n5.05\n\n\n0.14\n\n\n7.21\n\n\n457.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.00\n\n\n5.24\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n5.25\n\n\n397.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3\n\n\n1.24\n\n\n9.59\n\n\n0.13\n\n\n7.72\n\n\n878.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.17\n\n\n13.10\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n11.20\n\n\n504.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.11\n\n\n13.00\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n11.70\n\n\n397.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.13.1\n\n\n1.22\n\n\n5.83\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n4.78\n\n\n878.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.29\n\n\n6.65\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n5.17\n\n\n504.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.23\n\n\n7.25\n\n\n0.17\n\n\n5.88\n\n\n397.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be observed, antibodies prepared in accordance with the invention possess high affinities and binding constants.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nStructures of Anti-CTLA-4-Antibodies Prepared in Accordance with the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the following discussion, structural information related to antibodies prepared in accordance with the invention is provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to analyze structures of antibodies produced in accordance with the invention, we cloned genes encoding the heavy and light chain fragments out of the particular hybridoma. Gene cloning and sequencing was accomplished as follows: Poly(A)\n+\n mRNA was isolated from approximately 2×10\n5 \nhybridoma cells derived from immunized XenoMouse mice using a Fast-Track kit (Invitrogen). The generation of random primed cDNA was followed by PCR. Human V\nH \nor human V\nκ\n family specific variable region primers (Marks et al., “Oligonucleotide primers for polymerase chain reaction amplification of human immunoglobulin variable genes and design of family-specific oligonucleotide probes.” \nEur. J. Immunol. \n21:985-991 (1991)) or a universal human V\nH \nprimer, MG-30 (CAGGTGCAGCTGGAGCAGTCIGG) was used in conjunction with primers specific for the human Cγ2 constant region (MG-40d; 5′-GCTGAGGGAGTAGAGTCCTGAGGA-3′) or Cκ constant region (hκP2; as previously described in Green et al., 1994). Sequences of human Mabs-derived heavy and kappa chain transcripts from hybridomas were obtained by direct sequencing of PCR products generated from poly(A\n+\n) RNA using the primers described above. PCR products were also cloned into pCRII using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and both strands were sequenced using Prism dye-terminator sequencing kits and an ABI 377 sequencing machine. All sequences were analyzed by alignments to the “V BASE sequence directory” (Tomlinson et al., MRC Centre for Protein Engineering, Cambridge, UK) using MacVector and Geneworks software programs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, each of the antibodies 4.1.1, 4.8.1, 11.2.1, and 6.1.1 were subjected to full length DNA sequences. For such sequencing, Poly(A)\n+\n mRNA was isolated from approximately 4×10\n6 \nhybridoma cells using mRNA Direct kit (Dynal). The mRNA was reverse transcribed using oligo-dT(18) and the Advantage RT/PCR kit (Clonetech). The Variable region database (V Base) was used to design amplification primers beginning at the ATG start site of the heavy chain DP50 gene (5′-TATCTAAGCTTCTAGACTCGACCGCCACC\nATG\nGAGTTTGGGCTGAGC TG-3′) and to the stop codon of the IgG2 constant region (5′-TTCTCTGATCAGAATTCCTATCATTTACCCGGAGACAGGGAGAGCT-3′). An optimal Kozak sequence (ACCGCCACC) was added 5′ to the ATG start site. The same method was used to design a primer to the ATG start site of the kappa chain A27 gene (5′-TCTTCAAGCTTGCCCGGGCCCGCCACC\nATG\nGAAACCCCAGCGCAG-3′) and the stop codon of the kappa constant region (5′-TTCTTTGATCAGAATTCTCACTAACACTCTCCCCTGTTGAAGC-3′). The 012 cDNA was cloned by using a primer to the ATG start site (5′-TCTTCAAGCTTGCCCGGGCCCGCCACCATGGACATGAGGGTCCCCGC T-3) and the kappa constant region stop codon primer above. The heavy chain cDNAs were also cloned as genomic constructs by site directed mutagenesis to add an NheI site at the end of the variable J domain and subcloning an NheI-fragment containing the genomic IgG2 CH1/Hinge/CH2/CH3 regions. The point mutation to generate NheI site does not alter the amino acid sequence from germline. The primer pairs were used to amplify the cDNAs using Advantage High Fidelity PCR Kit (Clonetech). Sequence of the PCR was obtained by direct sequencing using dye-terminator sequencing kits and an ABI sequencing machine. The PCR product was cloned into pEE glutamine synthetase mammalian expression vectors (Lonza) and three clones were sequenced to confirm somatic mutations. For each clone, the sequence was verified on both strands in at least three reactions. An aglycosylated 4.1.1 antibody was generated by site directed mutagenesis of N294Q in the CH2 domain. Recombinant antibodies were produced by transient trasnfection of Cos7 cells in IgG depleted FCS and purified using standard Protein A sepharose techniques. Stable transfectants were generated by electroporation of murine NSO cells and selection in glutamine free media. Recombinant 4.1.1 with or without glycosylation exhibited identical specificity and affinity for CTLA4 in the in vitro ELISA and BIAcore assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene Utilization Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following Table sets forth the gene utilization evidenced by selected hybridoma clones of antibodies in accordance with the invention:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeavy and Light Chain Gene Utilization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHeavy Chain\n\n\n \n\n\nKappa Light Chain\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone\n\n\nVH\n\n\nD\n\n\nJH\n\n\nVK\n\n\nJK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.1\n\n\nDP-50\n\n\nDIR4 or\n\n\nJH4\n\n\nA27\n\n\nJK1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDIR3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.8.1\n\n\nDP-50\n\n\n7-27\n\n\nJH4\n\n\nA27\n\n\nJK4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.14.3\n\n\nDP-50\n\n\n7-27\n\n\nJH4\n\n\nA27\n\n\nJK3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.1\n\n\nDP-50\n\n\nDIR5 or\n\n\nJH4\n\n\nA27\n\n\nJK3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDIR5rc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1\n\n\nDP-50\n\n\n3-3\n\n\n \nJH6\n \n\n\n012\n\n\nJK3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.10.2\n\n\nDP-50\n\n\n7-27\n\n\nJH4\n\n\nA27\n\n\nJK3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3\n\n\nDP-65\n\n\n1-26\n\n\nJH6\n\n\nA10/A26\n\n\nJK4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.13.1\n\n\nDP-50\n\n\n7-27\n\n\nJH4\n\n\nA27\n\n\nJK3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.1\n\n\nDP-50\n\n\nD1-26\n\n\n \nJH6\n \n\n\n012\n\n\nJK3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.6.1\n\n\nDP-50\n\n\nD2-2 or\n\n\n \nJH6\n \n\n\n012\n\n\nJK3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nD4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.7.1\n\n\nDP-50\n\n\nD3-22\n\n\n \nJH4\n \n\n\n012\n\n\nJK3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nor D21-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.3.1.1\n\n\nDP-50\n\n\nD3-3 or\n\n\nJH4\n\n\nA17\n\n\nJK1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDXP4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.9.1.1\n\n\nDP-50\n\n\nD6-19\n\n\nJH4\n\n\nA3/A19\n\n\nJK4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.9.1\n\n\nDP-47\n\n\n5-24\n\n\nJH4\n\n\nL5\n\n\nJK1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nand/or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be observed, antibodies in accordance with the present invention were generated with a strong bias towards the utilization of the DP-50 heavy chain variable region. The DP-50 gene is also referred to as a V\nH \n3-33 family gene. Only one antibody that was selected on the basis of CTLA-4 binding and preliminary in vitro functional assays showed a heavy chain gene utilization other than DP-50. That clone, 2.1.3, utilizes a DP-65 heavy chain variable region and is an IgG4 isotype. The DP-65 gene is also referred to as a V\nH \n4-31 family gene. On the other hand, the clone, 4.9.1, which possesses a DP-47 heavy chain variable region binds to CTLA-4 but does not inhibit binding to B7-1 or B7-2. In XenoMouse mice, there are more than 30 distinct functional heavy chain variable genes with which to generate antibodies. Bias, therefore, is indicative of a preferred binding motif of the antibody-antigen interaction with respect to the combined properties of binding to the antigen and functional activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutation Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be appreciated, gene utilization analysis provides only a limited overview of antibody structure. As the B-cells in XenoMouse animals stocastically generate V-D-J heavy or V-J kappa light chain transcripts, there are a number of secondary processes that occur, including, without limitation, somatic hypermutation, n-additions, and CDR3 extensions. See, for example, Mendez et al. \nNature Genetics \n15:146-156 (1997) and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/759,620, filed Dec. 3, 1996. Accordingly, to further examine antibody structure predicted amino acid sequences of the antibodies were generated from the cDNAs obtained from the clones. In addition, N-terminal amino acid sequences were obtained through protein sequencing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n provides nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the heavy and kappa light chains of the clones 4.1.1 (\nFIG. 1A\n), 4.8.1 (\nFIG. 1B\n), 4.14.3 (\nFIG. 1C\n), 6.1.1 (\nFIG. 1D\n), 3.1.1 (\nFIG. 1E\n), 4.10.2 (\nFIG. 1F\n), 2.1.3 (\nFIG. 1G\n), 4.13.1 (\nFIG. 1H\n), 11.2.1 (\nFIG. 1I\n), 11.6.1 (\nFIG. 1J\n), 11.7.1 (\nFIG. 1K\n), 12.3.1.1 (\nFIG. 1L\n), and 12.9.1.1 (\nFIG. 1M\n).

In addition to the fact of the bias for heavy chain DP-50 in the majority of the clones, there is relatively limited hypermutation in the antibodies relative to the germline DP-50 gene. For example, clones 3.1.1 and 11.2.1 have no mutations. Moreover, the mutations in the other clones are generally conservative changes, involving substitutions of amino acids with similar properties to the amino acids in the germline. Mutations within many of the CDR1 and CRD2 sequences are particularly conservative in nature. Three of the heavy chains represented in\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n, 4.10.2, 4.13.1, and 4.14.3, are clearly derived from a single recombination event (i.e., derive from an identical germinal center) and are nearly identical in sequence. If these three are considered as a single sequence, then, among the 10 different antibodies containing the DP50 heavy chain, in CDR1 and CDR2 there are 3 positions in which a nonpolar residue is replaced by another nonpolar residue, 12 in which a polar uncharged residue is replaced by another polar uncharged residue, and 1 in which a polar charged residue is replaced by another polar charged residue. Further, there are two positions in which two residues which are very similar structurally, glycine and alanine, are substituted for one another. The only mutations not strictly conservative involve 3 substitutions of a polar charged residue for a polar uncharged residue and one substitution of a nonpolar residue for a polar residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe light chains of these antibodies are derived from 5 different Vk genes. The A27 gene is the most heavily represented and is the source of 6 different light chains. Comparison of these 6 sequences reveals two noteworthy features. First, in three of them, 4.8.1, 4.14.3, and 6.1.1, contain deletions of one or two residues in CDR1, a rare event. Second, there is a strong prejudice against the germline serine at position six in CDR3 in that the serine has been replaced in every sequence. This suggests that a serine at this position is incompatible with CTLA4 binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that many of the above-identified amino acid substitutions exist in close proximity to or within a CDR. Such substitutions would appear to bear some effect upon the binding of the antibody to the CTLA-4 molecule. Further, such substitutions could have significant effect upon the affinity of the antibodies.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nN-Terminal Amino Acid Sequence Analysis of Antibodies in Accordance with the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to further verify the composition and structure of the antibodies in accordance with the invention identified above, we sequenced certain of the antibodies using a Perkin-Elmer sequencer. Both heavy and kappa light chains of the antibodies were isolated and purified through use of preparative gel electrophoresis and electroblotting techniques and thereafter directly sequenced as described in Example 6. A majority of the heavy the heavy chain sequences were blocked on their amino terminus. Therefore, such antibodies were first treated with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase and thereafter sequenced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results from this experiment are shown in \nFIG. 9\n. \nFIG. 9\n also provides the molecular weight of the heavy and light chains as determined by mass spectroscopy (MALDI).\n\n\n \nExample 6 \n\n\nAdditional Characterization of Antibodies in Accordance with the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 10\n provides certain additional characterizing information about certain of the antibodies in accordance with the invention. In the Figure, data related to clones 3.1.1, 4.1.1, 4.8.1, 4.10.2, 4.14.3, and 6.1.1 is summarized. The following data is provided: Concentration, isoelectric focusing (IEF), SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, FACS, mass spectroscopy (MALDI), and light chain N-terminal sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the data was generated as follows:\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein concentration was determined at 280 nm from a UV scan (200-350 nm), where 1.58 absorbance units at 280 nm equaled 1 mg/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSDS-PAGE was performed using the Novex NuPAGE electrophoresis system with a 10% NuPAGE gel and MES running buffer. Samples were prepared by diluting 3:1 with 4× NuPAGE sample buffer (+/−) beta-mercaptoethanol, heated and ˜5 ug of protein was loaded onto the gel. The gel was then stained with Brilliant Blue R staining solution (Sigma cat. #B-6529) and molecular size estimates were made by comparing stained bands to “Perfect Protein Markers” (Novagen cat #69149-3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor N-terminal sequencing, samples were run as above on NuPAGE gels, transferred to Pro Blot immobilization membrane (Applied Biosystems) then stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The stained protein bands were excised and subjected to sequence analysis by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 494 Procise HT Sequencer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed using Pharmacia IEF 3-9 pHast gels (cat #17-0543-01). Samples were diluted in 10% glycerol to ˜0.8 mg/ml and 1 ul was loaded onto gel and then silver stained. The pI estimates were made by comparing stained bands to broad range (pH3-10) IEF standards (Pharmacia cat #17-0471-01)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSize exclusion chromatography (SEC) was carried in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) on the Pharmacia SMART system using the \nSuperdex\n 75 PC 3.2/30 column. Molecular size estimates were made by comparing peak retention time to the retention times of gel\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor FACS studies, human peripheral T cells were prepared and stimulated for 48 hours. T cells were washed once, resuspended in FACS buffer at 1×10\n6 \ncells/100 ul and stained for CD3 surface expression with 10 ul of anti-CD3-FITC (Immunotech, Marseille, France) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed twice, then fixed, permeabilized (Fix and Perm, Caltag), and stained for intracellular CTLA-4 expression with 10 ul anti-CD 152-PE (Pharmingen). Flow cytometry was performed using a Becton Dickinson FACSort. Quadrants were set by analysis of relevant isotype control antibodies (Caltag).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs was discussed above, anti-CTLA-4 antibodies have been demonstrated to possess certain powerful immune modulation activities. The following experiments were carried out in order to determine if antibodies in accordance with the present invention possessed such activities. In general, the experiments were designed to assess ability of the antibodies to inhibit the interaction between CTLA-4 and B7 molecules, be selective as between CTLA-4 and B7 molecules and CD28, and promote T cell cytokine production, including, but not limited to IL-2 and/or IFN-y expression. Further, examination of cross-reactivity of antibodies of the invention with certain human tissues and CTLA-4 molecules in other species (e.g., mouse and primate) was undertaken.\n\n\n \nExample 7 \n\n\nCompetition ELISA: Inhibition of CTLA-4/B7-1 or B7-2 Interaction by Antibodies in Accordance with the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nAn in vitro assay was conducted to determine if antibodies in accordance with the present invention were capable of inhibiting the binding of CTLA-4 with either B7-1 or B7-2. As will be appreciated, antibodies of the invention that are capable of inhibiting the binding of CTLA-4 with B7 molecules would be expected to be candidates for immune regulation through the CTLA-4 pathway. In the assay, the following materials and methods were utilized:\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \n3 nM B7.1-Ig(G1) or B7.2-Ig(G1) (Repligen, Inc. Needham, Mass.) in Dulbecco's PBS was coated on 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Nunc, Denmark, #439454) and incubated at 4° C. overnight. On \nday\n 2, B7-Ig was removed and plates were blocked with 1% BSA plus 0.05% Tween-20 in D-PBS for two hours. Plates were washed 3× with wash buffer (0.05% Tween-20 in D-PBS). Antibody at appropriate test concentrations and CTLA-4-Ig(G4) (0.3 nM final conc.) (Repligen, Inc. Needham, Mass.) were pre-mixed for 15 minutes and then added to the B7-Ig coated plate (60 ul total volume) and incubated at RT for 1.5 hours. Plates were washed 3× and 50 μl of a 1 to 1000 dilution of HRP-labeled mouse anti-human IgG4 antibody (Zymed, San Francisco, Calif., #05-3820) was added and incubated at RT for 1 hour. Plates were washed 3× and 50 μl TMB Microwell peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, Md., #50-76-04) was added and incubated at RT for 20 minutes, and then 50 μl 1N H\n2\nSO\n4 \nwas added to the plate. Plates were read at 450 nm using a Molecular Devices plate reader (Sunnyvale, Calif.). All samples were tested in duplicate. Maximal signal was defined as CTLA-4-Ig binding in the absence of test antibody. Non-specific binding was defined as absorbance in the absence of CTLA-4-Ig and test antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results from the assay are provided in Table IIIA and IIIB. In Table IIIA, results are shown for a variety of antibodies in accordance with the invention. In Table IIIB, results are shown comparing the 4.1.1 antibody of the invention with the 11.2.1 antibody of the invention from a separate experiment.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE IIIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCTLA4/B7.2\n\n\nCTLA4/B7.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone\n\n\n \n\n\nComp.

The following materials and methods were utilized in connection with the experiments:\n\n\n \nCTLA-4 Selectivity ELISA: Materials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nA 96-well FluroNUNC plate (Nunc Cat No. 475515) was platecoated with four antigens: CTLA-4/Ig, CD44/Ig, CD28/Ig, and B7.2/Ig (antigens generated in-house). The antigens were platecoated overnight at +4° C. at 1 ug/\nml\n 100 ul/well in 0.1M sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The plate was then washed with PBST (PBS+0.1% Tween-20) three times using a NUNC plate washer. The plate was blocked with PBST+0.5% BSA at 150 ul/well. The plate was incubated at RT for 1 hour then washed with PBST three times. Next the anti-CTLA-4 antibodies of the invention were diluted in block at 1 μg/ml and were added to the plate. The plate was incubated at RT for 1 hour then washed with PBST three times. The wells that contained the antibodies of the invention were then treated with 100 μl/well anti-human IgG2-HRP (Southern Biotech Cat No. 9070-05) at a 1:4000 dilution in block. Also, one row was treated with anti-human IgG (Jackson Cat No. 209-035-088) to normalize for platecoating. This antibody was diluted to 1:5000 in block and added at 100 ul/well. Also, one row was treated with anti-human CTLA-4-HRP (Pharmingen Cat No. 345815/Custom HRP conjugated) as a positive control. This antibody was used at 0.05 ug/ml diluted in block. The plate was incubated at RT for 1 hour then washed with PBST three times. LBA chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was added at 100 μl/well and the plate was incubated on a plateshaker for 5 min. The plate was then read using a lumi-imager for a 2 min. exposure.\n\n\n \nIGEN CTLA-4-Ig Selectivity Binding Assay: Materials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nM-450 Dynabeads (Dynal A. S, Oslo, Norway #140.02) were washed 3× with Na phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and resuspended in Na phosphate buffer. 1.0 μg CTLA-4-Ig(G1), 1.0 μg CD28-Ig(G1) or 1.0 to 3.0 μg B7.2-Ig(G1) (Repligen, Inc. Needham, Mass.) were added to 100 μl of beads and incubated overnight on a rotator at 4° C. On \nday\n 2 the beads were washed 3× in 1% BSA plus 0.05% Tween-20 in Dulbecco's PBS and blocked for 30 minutes. Beads were diluted 1 to 10 with blocking buffer and 25 μl of the coated beads were added to 12×75 mm polypropylene tubes. All samples were tested in duplicate. 50 μl test antibody (1 μg/ml final concentration) or blocking buffer was added to the tubes and incubated for 30 minutes on the Origen 1.5 Analyzer carousel (IGEN International, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.) at RT, vortexing at 100 rpm. 25 μl of ruthenylated murine anti-human IgG1, IgG2 or IgG4 (Zymed, Inc.

Tubes were incubated for 30 minutes at RT on the carousel vortexing at 100 rpm. 200 μl of Origen assay buffer (IGEN International, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md. #402-050-03) per tube was added and briefly vortexed and then the tubes were counted in the Origen Analyzer and ECL (electrochemiluminescence) units were determined for each tube.

The following materials and methods were utilized in connection with the experiments:\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nFreshly isolated human T cells were prepared by using Histopaque (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo. #A-70543) and T-kwik (Lympho-Kwik, One Lambda, Canoga Park, Calif., #LK-50-T), and stimulated with PHA (1 μg/ml) (Purified Phytohemagglutinin, Murex Diagnostics Ltd. Dartford, England, #HA 16) in medium (RPMI 1640 containing L-glutamine, MEM non-essential amino acids, penicillin, streptomycin, 25 mM Hepes and 10% FBS) at a concentration of 1×10\n6 \ncells/ml and incubated at 37° C. for 2 days. The cells were washed and diluted in medium to 2×10\n6 \ncells/ml. Raji cells (Burkitt lymphoma, Human ATCC No.: CCL 86 Class II American Type Culture Collection Rockville, Md.) were treated with mitomycin C (Sigma St. Louis, Mo., #M-4287) (25 μg/ml) for one hour at 37° C. The Raji cells were washed 4× in PBS and resuspended at 2×10\n6 \ncells/ml. Human T cell blasts (5×10\n5\n/ml), Raji cells (5×10\n5\n/ml) and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies or an isotyped-matched control antibody at various concentrations were added to 96-well microtiter plates and the plates were incubated at 37° C. for 72 hours. Total volume per well was 200 Seventy-two hours post stimulation, the plates were spun down and supernatant removed and frozen for later determination of IL-2 (Quantikine IL-2 ELISA kit, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., #D2050) and IFN-γ (Quantikine IFN-g ELISA kit, R&D Systems). Cytokine enhancement was defined as the difference between cytokine levels in cultures containing an anti-CTLA-4 blocking mAb versus an isotype-matched control antibody. For flow cytometry experiments, Raji cells were washed 1× with FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% heat inactivated FCS, 0.025% sodium azide). Cell pellets were resuspended in FACS buffer at 1×10\n6 \ncells/100 μl and incubated with 10 μl of anti-CD80-PE (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif.) or anti-CD86-PE (Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed twice and resuspended in 1 ml FACS buffer. Flow cytometry was performed using a Becton Dickinson FACSort. Histogram markers were set by analysis of relevant isotype control antibodies (Caltag, Burlingame, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, we have developed an assay that can be used for rapid determination of T-cell IL-2 upregulation. As will be appreciated, stimulation of T cells is B7 and CD28 dependent. Further, washed T blasts do not make detectable IL-2 and Raji cells do not make detectable IL-2 even when stimulated with LPS or PWM. However, in combination, the T blasts co-cultured with Raji cells can model B7, CTLA-4, and CD28 signaling events and the effects of antibodies thereon can be assessed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 11\n shows the expression of B7-1 and B7-2 on Raji cells using anti-CD8O-PE and anti-CD86-PE mAbs using flow cytometry (FACs) as described in Example 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 12\n shows the concentration dependent enhancement of IL-2 production in the T cell blast/Raji assay induced by CTLA-4 blocking antibodies (BNI3 (PharMingen) and the 4.1.1, 4.8.1, and 6.1.1 antibodies of the invention).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 13\n shows the concentration dependent enhancement of IFN-γ production in the T cell blast/Raji assay induced by CTLA-4 blocking antibodies (BNI3 (PharMingen) and the 4.1.1, 4.8.1, and 6.1.1 antibodies of the invention) (same donor T cells).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 14\n shows the mean enhancement of IL-2 production in T cells from 6 donors induced by CTLA-4 blocking antibodies in the T cell blast/Raji assay. It is interesting to consider that the mAb, CT4.9.1, binds to CTLA4 but does not block B7 binding. Thus, simply binding to CTLA-4 is insufficient by itself to provide a functional antibody of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 15\n shows the mean enhancement of IFN-γ production in T cells from 6 donors induced by CTLA-4 blocking antibodies in the T cell blast/Raji assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 19\n shows a comparison between the 4.1.1 and 11.2.1 antibodies of the invention at a concentration of 30 μg/ml in the 72 hour T cell blast/Raji assay as described in this Example 9 and the Superantigen assay described in Example 10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 20\n shows the concentration dependent enhancement of IL-2 production in the T cell blast/Raji assay induced by the 4.1.1 and 11.2.1 CTLA4 antibodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following Table IVc provides information related to mean enhancement and range of enhancement of cytokine response in the Raji and SEA assays of the invention.

The following materials and methods were utilized in connection with the experiments:\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman PBMC were prepared using Accuspin. Microtiter plates were precoated with an anti-CD3 antibody (leu4, Becton Dickinson) (60 ng/ml) and incubated for 2 hours at 37° C. hPBMC were added to the wells at 200,000 cells per well. \nStaphylcoccus enterotoxin \nA (SEA) (Sigma) was added to the wells at 100 ng/ml. Antibodies were added to the wells, usually at 30 μg/ml. Cells were then stimulated for 48, 72 or 96 hours. Plates were centrifuged at the desired time-point and supernatants were removed from the wells. Thereafter, supernatants were checked for IL-2 production using ELISA (R&D Systems).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults from these experiments are shown in \nFIGS. 16\n, \n17\n, and \n21\n. In \nFIG. 16\n, induction of IL-2 production in hPBMC from 5 donors was measured 72 hours after stimulation. In \nFIG. 17\n, results are shown from measurement of whole blood, analyzing the difference in induction of IL-2 production in the blood of 3 donors as measured at 72 and 96 hours after stimulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nFIG. 21\n, the enhancement of IL-2 production in whole blood of 2 donors as measured at 72 hours after stimulation.\n\n\n \nExample 11 \n\n\nTumor Animal Model\n\n\n \n \n \nWe have established an animal tumor model for the in vivo analysis of anti-murine-CTLA-4 antibodies in inhibiting tumor growth. In the model, a murine fibrosarcoma tumor is grown and the animals are treated with anti-murine-CTLA-4 antibodies. The materials and methods for establishment of the model are provided below:\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nFemale A/J mice (6-8 weeks old) were injected subcutaneously on the dorsal side of the neck with 0.2 ml of Sa1N tumor cells (1×10\n6\n) (Baskar 1995). Anti-murine CTLA-4 or an isotype matched control antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, Calif., 200 ug/animal) were injected intraperitioneally on \n \n \n \ndays\n \n \n \n 0, 4, 7 and 14 following the injection of tumor cells. Tumor measurements were taken during the course of the 3-4 week experiments using a Starrett SPC Plus electronic caliper (Athol, Mass.) and tumor size was expressed as the surface area covered by tumor growth (mm\n2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 18\n shows the inhibition of tumor growth with an anti-murine CTLA-4 antibody in a murine fibrosarcoma tumor model. As shown in \nFIG. 18\n, animals treated with anti-CTLA-4 had a reduction in tumor growth as compared to animals treated with an isotype control antibody. Accordingly, anti-murine CTLA4 mAbs are capable of inhibiting growth of a fibrosarcoma in a mouse tumor model.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is expected that antibodies that are cross-reactive with murine CTLA-4 would perform similarly in the model. However, of the antibodies of the invention that have been checked for cross-reactivity, none are cross-reactive with murine CTLA-4.\n\n\n \nExample 12 \n\n\nTumor Animal Model\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to further investigate the activity of antibodies in accordance with the invention, a xenograft SCID mouse model was designed to test the eradication of established tumors and their derived metastases. In the model, SCID mice are provided with grafted human T cells and are implanted with patient-derived non-small cell lung cell (NSCL) or colorectal carcinoma (CC) cells. Implantation is made into the gonadal fat pads of SCID mice. The tumors are allowed to grow, and thereafter removed. The mice develop human-like tumor and liver metastases. Such a model is described in Bumpers et al \nJ. Surgical Res. \n61:282-288 (1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is expected that antibodies of the invention will inhibit growth of tumors formed in such mice.\n\n\n \nINCORPORATION BY REFERENCE\n\n\n \n \n \nAll references cited herein, including patents, patent applications, papers, text books, and the like, and the references cited therein, to the extent that they are not already, are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to melanocortin receptor-specific cyclic peptides which may be used in the treatment of melanocortin receptor-mediated diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes, in particular energy homeostasis and metabolism related (e.g. diabetes), food intake related and/or energy balance and body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including obesity, overweight and diseases, disorders and/or conditions associated with obesity and/or overweight, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following discussion refers to a number of publications by author(s) and year of publication, and that due to recent publication dates certain publications are not to be is considered as prior art vis-a-vis the present invention. Discussion of such publications herein is given for more complete background and is not to be construed as an admission that such publications are prior art for patentability determination purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA family of melanocortin receptor types and subtypes have been identified, including melanocortin-1 receptors (MC1-R) expressed on normal human melanocytes and melanoma cells, melanocortin-2 receptors (MC2-R) for ACTH (adrenocorticotropin) expressed in cells of the adrenal gland, melanocortin-3 and melanocortin-4 receptors (MC3-R and MC4-R) expressed primarily in cells in the hypothalamus, mid-brain and brainstem, and melanocortin-5 receptors (MC5-R), expressed in a wide distribution of peripheral tissues. MC1-R has been suggested to be associated with hair and skin pigmentation and inflammation, MC2-R is believed to mediate steroidogenesis, MC3-R has been suggested to be associated with energy homeostasis, food intake, and inflammation, MC4-R is believed to control feeding behavior, energy homeostasis, and sexual function (e.g. erectile function), and MC5-R has been suggested to be involved in the exocrine gland system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSignificant work has been done in determining the structure of melanocortin receptors, including both the nucleic acid sequences encoding for the receptors and the amino acid sequences constituting the receptors. MC4-R is a G protein-coupled, 7-transmembrane receptor that is believed to be expressed primarily in the brain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMC4-R inactivation has been shown to result in obesity (Hadley, 1999, Ann N Y Acad Sci., 885:1-21). Agouti-related protein (AgRP) is an endogeneous compound that has been suggested to be a MC antagonist or an inverse agonist on MC4-R. The α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is believed to be the principle endogenous MC4-R agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso peripherally located MC4-R receptors have been suggested to be involved in the control of energy homeostasis, and the role of MC4-R signalling in the vagus nerve and its relevance for treatment of obesity and diabetes is discussed by Gautron et al, The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 518:6-24 (2010).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides specific for MC4-R, and secondarily peptides specific for MC3-R, are believed to be useful in regulation of mammalian energy homeostasis, including use as agents for attenuating food intake and body weight gain. MC4-R agonist peptides are believed to be useful for treating sexual dysfunction, including male erectile dysfunction, and for decreasing food intake and body weight gain, such as for treatment of obesity. Such peptides may also be employed for decreasing voluntary ethanol consumption, treatment of drug addictions, and the like. MC4-R agonist peptides, as well as MC3-R agonist peptides, may further be employed for treatment of circulatory shock, ischemia, hemorrhagic shock, inflammatory diseases and related diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes. MC4-R antagonist peptides, by contrast, are believed to be useful for weight gain aid, such as for use in treatment of cachexia, sarcopenia, wasting syndrome or disease, and anorexia. Such peptides may also be employed for treatment of depression and related disorders. (Wikberg et al, Nature Reviews, Drug Discovery, 7, 307, (2008); Adan et al, British J.

Melanocortin receptor-specific peptides include cyclic α-MSH analog peptides such as Ac-Nle-cyclo(-Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys)-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:1) (See U.S. Pat.

These and other melanocortin receptor-specific peptides generally contain the central tetrapeptide sequence of native α-MSH, His\n6\n-Phe\n7\n-Arg\n8\n-Trp\n9 \n(SEQ ID NO:3), or a mimetic or variation thereof, including the substitution of D-Phe for Phe\n7\n.

Notwithstanding the intense scientific and pharmaceutical interest in melanocortin receptor-specific peptides, evidenced by numerous articles in the scientific literature and numerous patent applications and issued patents (Nozawa et al, Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 18(4):403-427 (2008); Bednarek et al, Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 14(3):327-336 (2004); Todorovic et al, Peptides, 26, 2026-2036 (2005); and Ujjainwalla et al, Current Topics in Med. Chem., 7, 1068-1084 (2007)), no melanocortin receptor-specific peptide has been approved as a drug for any therapeutic indication. Indeed, there are no reports of any melanocortin receptor-specific peptide for any therapeutic indication having advanced past Phase II clinical trials. There remains a significant and substantial need for melanocortin receptor-specific peptides for use in pharmaceutical applications.

When reference is made herein to a substituted sulfonamide group, it means that at least one of said organic groups (R\na \nand R\nb\n) is substituted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “composition”, as in pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions utilized in the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing an active ingredient and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy a melanocortin receptor “agonist” is meant an endogenous substance, drug substance or compound, including a compound such as the peptides of the present invention, which can interact with a melanocortin receptor and initiate a pharmacological response, including but not limited to adenyl cyclase activation, characteristic of the melanocortin receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “α-MSH” is meant the peptide Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:4) and analogs and homologs thereof, including without limitation NDP-α-MSH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “NDP-α-MSH” is meant the peptide Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Nle-Glu-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:5) and analogs and homologs thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “EC\n50\n” is meant the molar concentration of an agonist, including a partial agonist, which produced 50% of the maximum possible response for that agonist. By way of example, a test compound which, at a concentration of 72 nM, produces 50% of the maximum possible response for that compound as determined in a cAMP assay in an MC4-R cell expression system has an EC\n50 \nof 72 nM. Unless otherwise specified, the molar concentration associated with an EC\n50 \ndetermination is in nanomoles per liter (nM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “Ki (nM)” is meant the equilibrium inhibitor dissociation constant representing the molar concentration of a competing compound that binds to half the binding sites of a receptor at equilibrium in the absence of radioligand or other competitors. In general, the numeric value of the Ki is inversely correlated to the affinity of the compound for the receptor, such that if the Ki is low, the affinity is high. Ki may be determined using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (Cheng Y., Prusoff W. H., \nBiochem. Pharmacol. \n22: 3099-3108, 1973):\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKi may be expressed in terms of specific receptors (e.g., MC1-R, MC3-R, MC4-R or MC5-R) and specific ligands (e.g. α-MSH or NDP-α-MSH).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “inhibition” is meant the percent attenuation, or decrease in receptor binding, in a competitive inhibition assay compared to a known standard. Thus, by “inhibition at 1 μM (NDP-α-MSH)” is meant the percent decrease in binding of NDP-α-MSH by addition of a determined amount of the compound to be tested, such as 1 μM of a test compound, such as under the assay conditions hereafter described. By way of example, a test compound that does not inhibit binding of NDP-α-MSH has a 0% inhibition, and a test compound that completely inhibits binding of NDP-α-MSH has a 100% inhibition. Typically, as described hereafter, a radio assay is used for competitive inhibition testing, such as with I\n125\n-labeled NDP-α-MSH, or a lanthanide chelate fluorescent assay, such as with Eu-NDP-α-MSH. However, other methods of testing competitive inhibition are known, including use of label or tag systems other than radioisotopes, and in general any method known in the art for testing competitive inhibition may be employed in this invention. It may thus be seen that “inhibition” is one measure to determine whether a test compound attenuates binding of α-MSH to melanocortin receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “binding affinity” is meant the ability of a compound or drug to bind to its biological target, expressed herein as Ki (nM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “intrinsic activity” is meant the maximal stimulation (functional activity) achievable by a compound in a specified melanocortin receptor expressing cell system, such as the maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. The maximal stimulation achieved by α-MSH or NDP-α-MSH is designated as an intrinsic activity of 1.0 (or 100%) and a compound capable of stimulating half the maximal activity that of α-MSH or NDP-α-MSH is designated as having an intrinsic activity of 0.5 (or 50%). A compound of this invention that under assay conditions described herein has an intrinsic activity of 0.7 (70%) or higher is classified as an agonist, a compound with intrinsic activity between 0.1 (10%) and 0.7 (70%) is classified as a partial agonist, and a compound with intrinsic activity below 0.1 (10%) is classified as inactive or having no intrinsic activity. In one aspect, the cyclic peptides of the present invention may generally be characterized as a partial agonist at MC4-R with respect to α-MSH or NDP-α-MSH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, “functional activity” is a measure of the signaling of a receptor, or measure of a change in receptor-associated signaling, such as a melanocortin receptor, and in particular MC4-R or hMC4-R, upon activation by a compound. Melanocortin receptors initiate signal transduction through activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. In one aspect, melanocortin receptors signal through Gα\nS\n, which catalyzes production of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase. Thus determination of stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, such as determination of maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, is one measure of functional activity, and is the primary measure exemplified herein. However, it is to be understood that alternative measures of functional activity may be employed in the practice of this invention, and are specifically contemplated and included within the scope of this invention. Thus, in one example intracellular free calcium may be measured, such as reported by and using the methods disclosed in Mountjoy K. G. et al., Melanocortin receptor-medicated mobilization of intracellular free calcium in HEK293 cells. \nPhysiol Genomics \n5:11-19, 2001, or Kassack M. U. et al., Functional screening of G protein-coupled receptors by measuring intracellular calcium with a fluorescence microplate reader. \nBiomol Screening \n7:233-246, 2002. It is also possible to measure activation by measurement of the production of inositol triphosphate or diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, such as by use of radioassays. Yet another measure of functional activity is receptor internalization, resulting from activation of regulatory pathways, such as using the methods disclosed in Nickolls S. A. et al., Functional selectivity of melanocortin 4 receptor peptide and nonpeptide agonists: evidence for ligand specific conformational states. \nJ Pharm Exper Therapeutics \n313:1281-1288, 2005. Yet another measure of functional activity is the exchange, and exchange rate, of nucleotides associated with activation of a G protein receptor, such as the exchange of GDP (guanosine diphosphate) for GTP (guanosine triphosphase) on the G protein α subunit, which may be measured by any number of means, including a radioassay using guanosine 5′-(γ-[\n35\nS]thio)-triphosphate, as disclosed in Manning D. R., Measures of efficacy using G proteins as endpoints: differential engagement of G proteins through single receptors. \nMol Pharmacol \n62:451-452, 2002. Various gene-based assays have been developed for measuring activation of G-coupled proteins, such as those disclosed in Chen W. et al., A colorimetric assay from measuring activation of Gs- and Gq-coupled signaling pathways. \nAnal Biochem \n226:349-354, 1995; Kent T. C. et al., Development of a generic dual-reporter gene assay for screening G-protein-coupled receptors. \nBiomol Screening, \n5:437-446, 2005; or Kotarsky K. et al., Improved receptor gene assays used to identify ligands acting on orphan seven-transmembrane receptors. \nPharmacology \n& \nToxicology \n93:249-258, 2003. The colorimetric assay of Chen et al. has been adapted for use in measuring melanocortin receptor activation, as disclosed in Hruby V. J. et al., Cyclic lactam α-melanocortin analogues of Ac-Nle\n4\n-cyclo[Asp\n5\n,D-Phe\n7\n,Lys\n10]\n α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-(4-10)-NH\n2 \nwith bulky aromatic amino acids at position 7 shows high antagonist potency and selectivity at specific melanocortin receptors. \nJ Med Chem \n38:3454-3461, 1995. In general, functional activity may be measured by any method, including methods of determining activation and/or signaling of a G-coupled receptor, and further including methods which may be hereafter developed or reported.

In particular, peptides of Formula (I) are believed to be useful in treating diseases, disorders and/or conditions responsive to modulation of the MC4-R function, more particularly activation of the MC4-R, i.e. diseases, disorders and/or conditions which would benefit from agonism (including full or partial agonism) at the MC4-R, including energy homeostasis and metabolism related (such as diabetes, in particular type 2 diabetes; dyslipidemia; fatty liver; hypercholesterolemia; hypertriglyceridemia; hyperuricacidemia; impaired glucose tolerance; impaired fasting glucos; insulin resistance syndrome; and metabolic syndrome), food intake related (such as hyperphagia; binge eating; bulimia; and compulsive eating) and/or energy balance and body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions, more particularly such diseases, disorders and conditions characterized by excess body weight and/or excess food intake.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides of Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), are particularly believed to be useful for treatment of body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions characterized by excess body weight, including obesity and overweight (by promotion of weight loss, maintenance of weight loss, and/or prevention of weight gain, including medication-induced weight gain or weight gain subsequent to cessation of smoking), and diseases, disorders and/or conditions associated with obesity and/or overweight, such as insulin resistance; impaired glucose tolerance; type 2 diabetes; metabolic syndrome; dyslipidemia (including hyperlipidemia); hypertension; heart disorders (e.g. coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction); cardiovascular disorders; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis); joint disorders (including secondary osteoarthritis); gastroesophageal reflux; sleep apnea; atherosclerosis; stroke; macro and micro vascular diseases; steatosis (e.g. in the liver); gall stones; and gallbladder disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides of Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), are particularly believed to be useful for treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes, more specifically obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood that there are medically accepted definitions of obesity and overweight. A patient may be identified by, for example, measuring body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared, and comparing the result with the definitions. The recommended classifications for BMI in humans, adopted by the Expert Panel on the Identification, Evaluation and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults, and endorsed by leading organizations of health professionals, are as follows: underweight <18.5 kg/m\n2\n, normal weight 18.5-24.9 kg/m\n2\n, overweight 25-29.9 kg/m\n2\n, obesity (class 1) 30-34.9 kg/m\n2\n, obesity (class 2) 35-39.9 kg/m\n2\n, extreme obesity (class 3)≧40 kg/m\n2 \n(Practical Guide to the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults, The North American Association for the Study of Obesity (NAASO) and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) 2000). Modifications of this classification may be used for specific ethnic groups and for children. Another alternative for assessing overweight and obesity is by measuring waist circumference. There are several proposed classifications and differences in the cutoffs based on ethnic group. For instance, according to the classification from the International Diabetes Federation, men having waist circumferences above 94 cm (cut off for europids) and women having waist circumferences above 80 cm (cut off for europids) are at higher risk of diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases because of excess abdominal fat. Another classification is based on the recommendation from the Adult Treatment Panel III where the recommended cut-offs are 102 cm for men and 88 cm for women. However, the peptides of Formula (I) may also be used for reduction of self-diagnosed overweight and for decreasing the risk of becoming obese due to life style, genetic considerations, heredity and/or other factors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is believed that peptides of Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), upon administration to an animal, including man, will reduce food intake, body weight and/or body weight gain in that animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being bound by any theory, it is believed that peptides of Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), act by modulating appetite and/or satiety, increasing metabolic rate, reducing intake of and/or craving for fat and/or carbohydrates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being bound by any theory, it is also believed that peptides of Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), act by enhancing glucose tolerance and/or decreasing insulin resistance. It is therefore believed that peptides of Formula (I) can be useful also for treatment of type 2 diabetes in underweight and normal weight individuals as well as in overweight and obese individuals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides of the invention might also be useful for (i) prevention of organ or tissue damage caused by hypoperfusion due to vessel occlusion (e.g. caused by thrombosis), haemorrhage, trauma, surgery, haemorrhagic shock, cardiogenic shock, toxic shock or septic shock or (iii) treatment of male and female sexual dysfunctions, such as male erectile dysfunction or female sexual arousal dysfunction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a peptide of Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), as previously defined for use as a medicament.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides the use of a peptide of Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), for treatment of diseases, disorders and/or conditions responsive to modulation of the MC4-R, such as diseases, disorders and/or conditions responsive to activation of the MC4-R, in particular energy homeostasis and metabolism related (e.g. diabetes), food intake related and/or energy balance and body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including obesity, overweight and diseases, disorders and/or conditions associated with obesity and/or overweight, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, the invention provides the use of a peptide of Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), in the preparation of a medicament for treatment of diseases, disorders and/or conditions responsive to modulation of the MC4-R, such as activation of the MC4-R, in particular energy homeostasis and metabolism related (e.g. diabetes), food intake related and/or energy balance and body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including obesity, overweight and diseases, disorders and/or conditions associated with obesity and/or overweight, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides of the invention are advantageously more selective (i.e. higher affinity and/or higher specificity) for MC4-R and/or MC3-R than for MC1-R, MC2-R and MC5-R, in particular MC1-R. In particular, peptides of the invention are advantageously more selective for MC4-R than for any of MC3-R and MC1-R. Peptides of the invention are suitably at least 3-fold, in particular 10-fold, more particularly 30-fold, more selective for MC4-R than for any of MC1-R, MC2-R, MC3-R and MC5-R. Some peptides of the invention are even more than 100-fold, such as even about 150-fold, more selective for MC4-R than MC1-R as determined in the receptor binding assay described in 7.1. It is noted that the selectivity profile may affect in vivo safety and side effects obtained upon administration of the peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon treatment of energy homeostasis and metabolism related, food intake related and/or energy balance and body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions, it is desirable to reduce or eliminate unwanted side-effects that may result from MC4-R activation, such as sexual side-effects, including penile erection, and blood pressure effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides of the invention are believed to be useful for treatment of energy homeostasis and metabolism related (e.g. diabetes), food intake related and/or energy balance and body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including obesity, overweight and diseases, disorders and/or conditions associated with obesity and/or overweight, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, without causing substantial adverse cardiovascular effects, including a substantial increase in blood pressure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides of the invention are believed to be useful for treatment of energy homeostasis and metabolism related (e.g. diabetes), food intake related and/or energy balance and body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including obesity, overweight and diseases, disorders and/or conditions associated with obesity and/or overweight, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, without causing substantial unwanted sexual effects resulting from MC4-R activation, such as penile erection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is believed that peptides of Formula I, and in particular Formula (II) or (III), possess a satisfactory pharmacological profile and promising biopharmaceutical properties, such as toxicological profile, metabolism and pharmacokinetic properties, solubility, and permeability. It will be understood that determination of appropriate biopharmaceutical properties is within the knowledge of a person skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n3.0 Combination Therapy for Certain Indications\n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be used for treatment of any of the foregoing diseases, indications, conditions or syndromes, or any disease, indication, condition or syndrome which is melanocortin receptor mediated, by administration in combination with one or more other pharmaceutically active compounds. Such combination administration may be by means of a single dosage form which includes both a peptide of the present invention and one more other pharmaceutically active compound, such single dosage form including a tablet, capsule, spray, inhalation powder, injectable liquid or the like. Alternatively, combination administration may be by means of administration of two different dosage forms, with one dosage form containing a peptide of the present invention, and the other dosage form including another pharmaceutically active compound. In this instance, the dosage forms may be the same or different. Without meaning to limit combination therapies, the following exemplifies certain combination therapies which may be employed.\n\n\n \n3.1 Combination Therapy for Obesity and Related Metabolic Syndrome\n\n\n \n \n \nOne or more peptides of the invention may be combined with one or more other pharmacologically active agent(s) that is (are) useful in the treatment of various weight and feeding-related disorders, such as obesity and/or overweight, in particular other anti-obesity drugs that affect energy expenditure, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glucogenolysis, lipolysis, lipogenesis, fat absorption, fat storage, fat excretion, hunger and/or satiety and/or craving mechanisms, appetite/motivation, food intake, or gastrointestinal motility.

The exact dose, however, is determined by the attending clinician and is dependent on such factors as the potency of the compound administered, the age, weight, condition and response of the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more peptides of the invention may be combined with one or more other pharmacologically active agent(s) that is (are) useful in the treatment of diabetes, such as other anti-diabetic drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more peptides of the invention may in addition or alternatively further be combined with one or more other pharmacologically active agent(s) that is (are) useful in the treatment of diseases, disorders and/or conditions associated with obesity and/or overweight, such as insulin resistance;

Any of a number of well-known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the peptides of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclic peptides of the present invention may be readily synthesized by known conventional procedures for the formation of a peptide linkage between amino acids. Such conventional procedures include, for example, any solution phase procedure permitting a condensation between the free alpha amino group of an amino acid or residue thereof having its carboxyl group and other reactive groups protected and the free primary carboxyl group of another amino acid or residue thereof having its amino group or other reactive groups protected. In a preferred conventional procedure, the cyclic peptides of the present invention may be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis and purified according to methods known in the art. Any of a number of well-known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the peptides of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe process for synthesizing the cyclic peptides may be carried out by a procedure whereby each amino acid in the desired sequence is added one at a time in succession to another amino acid or residue thereof or by a procedure whereby peptide fragments with the desired amino acid sequence are first synthesized conventionally and then condensed to provide the desired peptide. The resulting peptide is then cyclized to yield a cyclic peptide of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid phase peptide synthesis methods are well known and practiced in the art. In such methods the synthesis of peptides of the invention can be carried out by sequentially incorporating the desired amino acid residues one at a time into the growing peptide chain according to the general principles of solid phase methods. These methods are disclosed in numerous references, including Merrifield, R. B., Solid phase synthesis (Nobel lecture). \nAngew Chem \n24:799-810 (1985) and Barany et al., The Peptides, Analysis, Synthesis and Biology, Vol. 2, Gross, E. and Meienhofer, J., Eds. Academic Press 1-284 (1980).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn chemical syntheses of peptides, reactive side chain groups of the various amino acid residues are protected with suitable protecting groups, which prevent a chemical reaction from occurring at that site until the protecting group is removed. Also common is the protection of the alpha amino group of an amino acid residue or fragment while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed by the selective removal of the alpha amino protecting group to allow a subsequent reaction to take place at that site. Specific protecting groups have been disclosed and are known in solid phase synthesis methods and solution phase synthesis methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlpha amino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, including a urethane-type protecting group, such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, such as p-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-biphenyl-isopropoxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Moz) and aliphatic urethane-type protecting groups, such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, isopropoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc). Fmoc are preferred for alpha amino protection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGuanidino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, such as nitro, p-toluenesulfonyl (Tos), Z, pentamethylchromanesulfonyl (Pmc), adamantyloxycarbonyl, pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Pbf) and Boc. Pbf and Pmc are preferred protecting groups for Arg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides of the invention described herein were prepared using solid phase synthesis, such as by means of a Symphony Multiplex Peptide Synthesizer (Rainin Instrument Company/Protein Technologies Inc) automated peptide synthesizer, using programming modules as provided by the manufacturer and following the protocols set forth in the manufacturer's manual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid phase synthesis is commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha amino acid to a suitable resin. Such starting material is prepared by attaching an alpha amino-protected amino acid by an amide linkage to a 4-(2′,4′-dimethoxylphenyl-aminomethyl-phenoxy (Rink Amide) resin, a 4-(2′,4′-dimethoxylphenyl-aminomethyl)-phenoxyacetamido-norleucyl-MBHA resin, an amino-xanthen-3-yloxy-merifiel resin (Sieber Amide) resin, or by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin, a 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin or by other means well known in the art. Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin supports are commercially available and generally used when feasible. The resins are carried through repetitive cycles as necessary to add amino acids sequentially. The alpha amino Fmoc protecting groups are removed under basic conditions. Piperidine, piperazine, diethylamine, or morpholine (20-40% v/v) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) may be used for this purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing removal of the alpha amino protecting group, the subsequent protected amino acids are coupled stepwise in the desired order to obtain an intermediate, protected peptide-resin. The activating reagents used for coupling of the amino acids in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the art. After the peptide is synthesized, if desired, the orthogonally protected side chain protecting groups may be removed using methods well known in the art for further derivatization of the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, orthogonal protecting groups are used as appropriate. For example, the peptides of the invention contain multiple amino acids with an amino group-containing side chain. In one aspect, an Allyl-Alloc protection scheme is employed with the amino acids forming a lactam bridge through their side chains, and orthogonal protecting groups, cleavable under different reactive conditions, use for other amino acids with amino group-containing side chains. Thus, for example, Fmoc-Orn(Alloc)-OH and Fmoc-Glu(OAll)-OH amino acids (Glu(OAll) refers to glutamic acid 5-allyl ester) can be employed for the positions forming a lactam bridge upon cyclization, while other amino acids with amino group-containing side chains have a different and orthogonal protecting group, such as with Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc-Lys(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc-Dab(Pbf)-OH or the like. Other protecting groups may be similarly employed; by way of example and not limitation, Mtt/OPp (4-methyltrityl/2-phenylisopropyl) can be employed with the side chains forming a lactam bridge upon cyclization, with orthogonal protecting groups being utilized for other positions that are not cleavable using conditions suitable for cleavage of Mtt/OPp.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReactive groups in a peptide can be selectively modified, either during solid phase synthesis or after removal from the resin. For example, peptides can be modified to obtain N-terminus modifications, such as acetylation, while on resin, or may be removed from the resin by use of a cleaving reagent and then modified. Similarly, methods for modifying side chains of amino acids are well known to those skilled in the art of peptide synthesis. The choice of modifications made to reactive groups present on the peptide will be determined, in part, by the characteristics that are desired in the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the peptides of the present invention, in one embodiment the N-terminus group is modified by introduction of an N-acetyl group. In one aspect, a method is employed wherein after removal of the protecting group at the N-terminal, the resin-bound peptide is reacted with acetic anhydride in DMF in the presence of an organic base, such aspyridine. Other methods of N-terminus acetylation are known in the art, including solution phase acetylation, and may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide can, in one embodiment, be cyclized prior to cleavage from the peptide resin. For cyclization through reactive side chain moieties, the desired side chains are deprotected, and the peptide suspended in a suitable solvent and a cyclic coupling agent added. Suitable solvents include, for example DMF, dichloromethane (DCM) or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Suitable cyclic coupling reagents include, for example, 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (BOP), benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris(pyrrolidino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), 2-(7-aza-1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TATU), 2-(2-oxo-1(2H)-pyridyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TPTU) or N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole (DCCI/HOBt). Coupling is conventionally initiated by use of a suitable base, such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), sym-collidine or N-methylmorpholine (NMM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclized peptides can then be cleaved from solid phase, using any suitable reagent, such as ethylamine in DCM or various combinations of agents, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), tri-isopropylsilane (TIS), dimethoxybenezene (DMB), water and the like. The resulting crude peptide is dried and remaining amino acid side chain protecting groups, if any, are cleaved using any suitable reagent, such as TFA in the presence of water, TIS, 2-mercaptopethane (ME), and/or 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT). The final product is precipitated by adding cold ether and collected by filtration. Final purification is by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), using a suitable column, such as a C\n18 \ncolumn, or other methods of separation or purification, such as methods based on the size or charge of the peptide, can also be employed. Once purified, the peptide can be characterized by any number of methods, such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor peptides of the present invention which have a C-terminus substituted amide derivative or N-alkyl group, synthesis may proceed by solid phase synthesis commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha amino acid to a suitable resin. Such methods for preparing substituted amide derivatives on solid-phase have been described in the art. See, for example, Barn D. R. et al., Synthesis of an array of amides by aluminum chloride assisted cleavage on resin bound esters. \nTetrahedron Letters, \n37:3213-3216 (1996); DeGrado W. F. and Kaiser E. T., Solid-phase synthesis of protected peptides on a polymer bound oxime: Preparation of segments comprising the sequences of a cytotoxic 26-peptide analogue. \nJ. Org. Chem., \n47:3258-3261 (1982). Such a starting material can be prepared by attaching an alpha amino-protected amino acid by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin or an by amide linkage to a 4-(2′,4′-dimethoxylphenyl-aminomethyl-phenoxy (Rink Amide) resin by well known means. The peptide chain is grown with the desired sequence of amino acids. Before cleavage, the peptide is cyclized on the solid phase. Peptides employing a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin may be cleaved from resin by aluminum chloride in DCM, and peptides employing a Rink Amide resin may be cleaved by mixture of TFA, TIS and water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile synthesis has been described primarily with reference to solid phase Fmoc chemistry, it is to be understood that other chemistries and synthetic methods may be employed to make the cyclic peptides of the invention, such as by way of example and not limitation, methods employing Boc chemistry, solution chemistry, and other chemistries and synthetic methods.\n\n\n \n5.1 Salt Form of Cyclic Peptides of the Present Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nIt shall be understood that as used herein all references to peptides according to the invention, including a specific chemical formula or name, are intended to include all pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, hydrates, polymorphs, prodrugs, metabolites, stereoisomers, and tautomeric isomers thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCyclic peptides of the present invention may be in the form of any pharmaceutically acceptable salt.

Acid addition salts of peptides of the present invention are prepared in a suitable solvent for the peptide and an excess of an acid, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, trifluoroacetic (TFA), citric, tartaric, maleic, succinic or methanesulfonic acid. The acetate, ammonium acetate and TFA acid salt forms are especially useful.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere peptides of the present invention include an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts may include alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium salts, or alkaline earth metal salts, such as calcium or magnesium salts. It is also to be understood that certain peptides of the Formula (I) can exist in solvated forms, including solvates of the free peptide or solvates of a salt of the compound, as well as unsolvated forms. The term “solvate” is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term “hydrate” is employed when said solvent is water. It is to be understood that all polymorphs, including mixtures of different polymorphs, are included within the scope of the claimed peptides.\n\n\n \n5.2 Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides a pharmaceutical composition that includes one or more cyclic peptides of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. When formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, the compound of the invention may be present in the pharmaceutical composition in a concentration from 0.1 to 99.5%, such as from 0.5 to 95%, by weight of the total composition. The choice of carrier is within the knowledge of a person skilled in the art and depends on, for instance, the mode of administration, the dosage form, and the physical properties of the active compound, such as solubility and stability. The term “carrier” as used herein relates to a therapeutically inactive ingredient. The dosage form may be a solid, semi-solid or liquid system. The formulation may be an immediate and/or modified release, including delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe carrier may be a liquid formulation, and is preferably a buffered, isotonic, aqueous solution. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers also include excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as hereafter described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclic peptide compositions of the present invention may be formulated or compounded into pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one cyclic peptide of the present invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, including excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as may be desired. Formulation excipients may include polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, hydroxy propyl cellulose (HPC), acacia, polyethylene glycol, mannitol, sodium chloride and sodium citrate. For injection or other liquid administration formulations, water containing at least one or more buffering constituents is preferred, and stabilizing agents, preservatives and solubilizing agents may also be employed. For solid administration formulations, any of a variety of thickening, filler, bulking and carrier additives may be employed, such as starches, sugars, cellulose derivatives, fatty acids and the like. For topical administration formulations, any of a variety of creams, ointments, gels, lotions and the like may be employed. For most pharmaceutical formulations, non-active ingredients will constitute the greater part, by weight or volume, of the preparation. For pharmaceutical formulations, it is also contemplated that any of a variety of measured-release, slow-release or sustained-release formulations and additives may be employed, so that the dosage may be formulated so as to provide delivery of a peptide of the present invention over a period of time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the actual quantity of cyclic peptides of the present invention administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending on the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn practical use, the cyclic peptides of the invention can be combined as the active ingredient in an admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, for example, oral, parenteral (including intravenous), urethral, vaginal, nasal, buccal, sublingual, or the like. In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent an advantageous oral dosage unit form. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or non-aqueous techniques. The amount of active peptide in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. In another dosage unit form, sublingual constructs may be employed, such as sheets, wafers, tablets or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as povidone, gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; diluents; fillers such as microcrystalline cellulose; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch or alginic acid; preservatives; colorants; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as fatty oil. Various other materials may be utilized as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf formulated for oral delivery, the peptide is preferably formulated and made such that it is encased in an enteric protectant, more preferably such that it is not released until the tablet or capsule has transited the stomach, and optionally has further transited a portion of the small intestine. In the context of this application it will be understood that the term enteric coating or material refers to a coating or material that will pass through the stomach essentially intact but will disintegrate after passing through the stomach to release the active drug substance. Materials that may be used includes cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethyl-ethylcellulose succinate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, and methacrylic acid-methyl methacrylate copolymer. The enteric coating employed promotes dissolution of the dosage form primarily at a site outside the stomach, and may be selected such that the enteric coating dissolves at a pH of approximately at least 5.5, more preferable at a pH of from about 6.0 to about 8.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of a variety of permeation enhancers may be employed, to increase uptake in the intestines upon dissolution of the enteric coating. In one aspect, permeation enhancers increase either paracellular or transcellular transport systems. Representative, non-limiting examples of such permeation enhancers include calcium chelators, bile salts (such as sodium cholate), and fatty acids. In some embodiments, peptides or polypeptides that act as substrates for intestinal proteases are further added. Cyclic peptides may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active peptides may for instance be prepared in water mixed with for instance hydroxy-propylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. These preparations may optionally contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that it may be administered by syringe. The form must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol, for example glycerol, propylene glycol or liquid polyethylene glycol, suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclic peptides of the present invention may be therapeutically applied by means of nasal administration. By “nasal administration” is meant any form of intranasal administration of any of the cyclic peptides of the present invention. The peptides may be in an aqueous solution, such as a solution including saline, citrate or other common excipients or preservatives. The peptides may also be in a dry or powder formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf in an aqueous solution, the cyclic peptides may be appropriately buffered by means of saline, acetate, phosphate, citrate, acetate or other buffering agents, which may be at any physiologically acceptable pH, such as from about pH 4 to about pH 7. A combination of buffering agents may also be employed, such as phosphate buffered saline, a saline and acetate buffer, and the like. In the case of saline, a 0.9% saline solution may be employed. In the case of acetate, phosphate, citrate, and the like, a 50 mM solution may be employed. In addition to buffering agents, a suitable preservative may be employed, to prevent or limit bacteria and other microbial growth. One such preservative that may be employed is 0.05% benzalkonium chloride.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative embodiment, cyclic peptides of the present invention may be administered directly into the lung. Intrapulmonary administration may be performed by means of a metered dose inhaler, a device allowing self-administration of a metered bolus of a peptide of the present invention when actuated by a patient during inspiration. Any of a variety of different techniques may be used to make dry powder microparticles, including but not limited to micro-milling, spray drying and a quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclic peptides of the present invention may be therapeutically administered by means of an injection of a sustained release formulation. In general, any of a number of injectable and bioerodible polymers may be employed in a sustained release injectable formulation. Alternatively other sustained release formulations may be employed, including formulations permitting subcutaneous injection, which other formulations may include one or more of nano/microspheres, liposomes, emulsions (such as water-in-oil emulsions), gels, insoluble salts or suspensions in oil The formulation may be such that an injection is required on a daily, weekly, monthly or other periodic basis, depending on the concentration and amount of cyclic peptide, the sustained release rate of the materials employed, and other factors known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n5.3 Routes of Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nIf a composition including one or more peptides of the present invention is administered by injection, the injection may be intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or other means known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides of the present invention may be formulated by any means known in the art, including but not limited to formulation as tablets, capsules, caplets, suspensions, powders, lyophilized preparations, suppositories, ocular drops, skin patches, oral soluble formulations, sprays, aerosols and the like, and may be mixed and formulated with buffers, binders, excipients, stabilizers, anti-oxidants and other agents known in the art. In general, any route of administration by which the peptides of invention are introduced across an epidermal layer of cells may be employed. Administration means may thus include administration through mucous membranes, buccal administration, oral administration, dermal administration, inhalation administration, nasal administration, urethral administration, vaginal administration, and the like.\n\n\n \n5.4 Therapeutically Effective Amount\n\n\n \n \n \nIn general, the actual quantity of cyclic peptide of the present invention administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending upon the mode of administration, the patient (including weight, sex, health condition and diet), the formulation used, and the response desired. The dosage for treatment is administration, by any of the foregoing means or any other means known in the art, of an amount sufficient to bring about the desired therapeutic effect. The cyclic peptides of the present invention are highly active. For example, the cyclic peptide can be administered (as a single dose or in divided daily doses) at about 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 50, 100, 500, 1000 or 5000 μg/kg body weight, depending on the specific peptide selected, the desired therapeutic response, the route of administration, the formulation and other factors known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n6.0 Peptides of the Present Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention relates to a cyclic peptide of the structural Formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nincluding all enantiomers, stereoisomers or diastereoisomers thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of any of the foregoing,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nR\n1 \nis —NH—C(═O)— or —C(═O)—NH—;\n \nR\n2 \nis —H or —CH\n2\n—, and if R\n2 \nis —CH\n2\n— forms with R\n3 \na pyrrolidine ring, the pyrrolidine ring optionally substituted with —OH;\n \nR\n3 \nis —(CH\n2\n)\n2\n— if R\n2 \nis —CH\n2\n—, and otherwise R\n3 \nis selected from\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n4a\n, R\n4b \nand R\n4c \nare each independently selected from hydrogen, halo, (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkyl-halo, (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkyl-dihalo, (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkyl-trihalo, (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkyl, (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkoxy, (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkylthio, aryl, aryloxy, nitro, nitrile, sulfonamide, amino, monosubstituted amino, disubstituted amino, hydroxy, carboxy, or alkoxy-carbonyl, on the proviso that at least one of R\n4a\n, R\n4b \nand R\n4c \nis not hydrogen;\n\n\nR\n5 \nis —OH or —N(R\n6a\n)(R\n6b\n);\n\n\nR\n6a \nand R\n6b \nare each independently H or a C\n1 \nto C\n4 \nlinear, branched or cyclic alkyl chain;\n\n\nR\n7 \nis —H or —C(═O)—NH\n2\n;\n\n\nw is in each instance independently 0 to 5;\n\n\nx is 1 to 5;\n\n\ny is 1 to 5; and\n\n\nz is in each instance independently 1 to 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention relates to a cyclic peptide of Formula (I) which is of formula (II):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention relates to a cyclic peptide of Formula (I) which is of Formula (III):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides a cyclic heptapeptide which contains a core sequence derived from His-Phe-Arg-Trp within the cyclic portion, and where the amino acid in the first position is Arg and is outside the cyclic portion. Without being bound by any theory, the Arg residue is believed to largely contribute to the low activity at MC1-R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the core sequence in the peptides of Formula I includes a substituted D-Phe. Without being bound by any theory, it is believed that the intrinsic activity may be lowered while substantially maintaining potency by using substituted D-Phe in peptides in accordance with the invention. The peptide called Ref Ex 1 (including unsubstituted D-Phe) in Table 1 can be compared with one or more of Examples 1-5, 9-11, 17, 26 and 27. It may be noted that Table 1 includes mean values.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.1 ng/mL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDoxycycline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIntrinsic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nK\ni\n \n\n\nEC\n50\n \n\n\nactivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRef Ex 1\n\n\nAc-Arg-cyclo(Glu-Dab-D-\n\n\n0.65\n\n\n0.33\n\n\n94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe-Arg-Trp-Orn)-NH\n2\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRef Ex 2\n\n\nAc-Arg-cyclo(Glu-Dab-D-\n\n\n8\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n92\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe-Arg-Trp-Orn)-OH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein one or more of R\n4a\n, R\n4b \nand R\n4c \nare each independently selected from hydrogen, halo, (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkyl-halo, (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkyl-dihalo, (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkyl-trihalo, (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkyl, (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkoxy, phenyl, nitro, nitrile, amino or hydroxy, on the proviso that at least one of R\n4a\n, R\n4b \nand R\n4c \nis not hydrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein one or more of R\n4a\n, R\n4b \nand R\n4c \nare each independently selected from hydrogen, halo, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl-halo, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl-dihalo, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl-trihalo, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, phenyl, nitro, nitrile, amino or hydroxy, on the proviso that at least one of R\n4a\n, R\n4b \nand R\n4c \nis not hydrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein one or more of R\n4a\n, R\n4b \nand R\n4c \nare each independently selected from\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein one or more of R\n4a\n, R\n4b \nand R\n4c \nare each independently selected from hydrogen, halo, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl-halo, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl-dihalo, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl-trihalo, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, nitro, nitrile, amino or hydroxy, on the proviso that at least one of R\n4a\n, R\n4b \nand R\n4c \nis not hydrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein one or more of R\n4a\n, R\n4b \nand R\n4c \nare each independently selected from\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein R\n4a\n, is selected from\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nand R\n4b \nand R\n4c \nare each H.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein R\n4a \nis selected from —C≡N or —F, and R\n4b \nand R\n4c \nare each H.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein R\n4a \nis in the 4 position and is —C≡N and R\n4b \nand R\n4c \nare each H.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another particular embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein R\n4a \nis in the 4 position and is —F and R\n4b \nand R\n4c \nare each H.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides encompassed within Formula (I) contain one or more asymmetric elements such as stereogenic centers, stereogenic axes and the like, so that the peptides encompassed within Formula (I) can exist in different stereoisomeric forms. For both specific and generically described peptides, including the peptides encompassed within Formula (I), all forms of isomers at all chiral or other isomeric centers, including enantiomers and diastereomers, are intended to be covered herein. The peptides of the invention each include multiple chiral centers, and may be used as a racemic mixture or an enantiomerically enriched mixture, in addition to use of the peptides of the invention in enantiopure preparations. Typically, the peptides of the invention will be synthesized with the use of chirally pure reagents, such as specified L- or D-amino acids, using reagents, conditions and methods such that enantiomeric purity is maintained, but it is possible and contemplated that racemic mixtures may be made. Such racemic mixtures may optionally be separated using well-known techniques and an individual enantiomer may be used alone. In cases and under specific conditions of temperature, solvents and pH wherein peptides may exist in tautomeric forms, each tautomeric form is contemplated as being included within this invention whether existing in equilibrium or predominantly in one form. Thus a single enantiomer of a peptide of Formula (I), which is an optically active form, can be obtained by asymmetric synthesis, synthesis from optically pure precursors, or by resolution of the racemates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides of formulas (II) and (III) are specific stereoisomeric forms of the peptides of Formula (I), but the invention should not be construed as being limited to the stereoisomeric forms encompassed by formulas (II) and (III).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is further intended to include prodrugs of the present peptides, which on administration undergo chemical conversion by metabolic processes before becoming active pharmacological peptides. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the present peptides, which are readily convertible in vivo into a peptide of Formula (I). Prodrugs are any covalently bonded compounds, which release the active parent peptide drug of Formula (I) in vivo. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in “Design of Prodrugs”, ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985. Typical examples of prodrugs have biologically labile protecting groups on a functional moiety, such as for example by esterification of hydroxyl, carboxyl or amino functions. Thus by way of example and not limitation, a prodrug includes peptides of Formula (I) wherein an ester prodrug form is employed, such as, for example, lower alkyl esters of the R group of Formula (I), such as where R is —OH, which lower alkyl esters may include from 1-8 carbons in an alkyl radical or aralkyl esters which have 6-12 carbons in an aralkyl radical. Broadly speaking, prodrugs include compounds that can be oxidized, reduced, aminated, deaminated, hydroxylated, dehydroxylated, hydrolyzed, dehydrolyzed, alkylated, dealkylated, acylated, deacylated, phosphorylated or dephosphorylated to produce an active parent peptide drug of Formula (I) in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain modifications of peptides of Formula I may be made in order to enhance the half-life of the peptide (see G. Pasuta and F. M. Veronese (2007) “Polymer-drug conjugation, recent achievements and general strategies” \nProgress in Polymer Science \n32 (8-9): 933-961).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject invention also includes peptides which are identical to those recited in Formula (I), but for the fact that one or more atoms depicted in Formula (I) are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into peptides of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO and \n17\nO, respectively. Peptides of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates of said peptides which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labeled peptides of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as \n3\nH and \n14\nC are incorporated, may have use in a variety of assays, such as in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Substitution with heavier isotopes, such as substitution of one or more hydrogen atoms with deuterium (\n2\nH), can provide pharmacological advantages in some instances, including increased metabolic stability. Isotopically labeled peptides of Formula (I) can generally be prepared by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), R\n1 \nis —C(═O)—NH—, x is 2 and y is 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), R\n1 \nis —C(═O)—NH—, x is 1 and y is 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), R\n1 \nis —NH—C(═O)—, x is 3 and y is 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn still another embodiment of the peptides according to the Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), R\n1 \nis —NH—C(═O)—, x is 4 and y is 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment of the peptides according to the Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), R\n1 \nis —C(═O)—NH—, x is 2 and y is 3, or alternatively R\n1 \nis —NH—C(═O)—, x is 3 and y is 2. More specifically, R\n1 \nis —C(═O)—NH—, x is 2 and y is 3. It has surprisingly and unexpectedly been found that peptides according to the invention having a lactam bridge wherein the amide bond is positioned by means of the side chain of Glu (at the N-terminus end of the cyclic portion) and the side chain of Orn (at the C-terminus end of the cyclic portion) generally provides improved potency as determined by EC\n50\n, in particular in the herein described low density hMC4-R system, compared to peptides wherein the amide bond is positioned by means of the side chains of Asp and Lys, but which are otherwise identical. This discovery is contrary to assertions in the prior art that the location and direction of an amide bond in the lactam bridge of melanocortin receptor specific peptides is of little importance for activity and does not interact with receptors.

\nPeptides of the following structures were synthesized by the general methods described above, and except where indicated MC1-R Ki and MC4-R Ki values for each peptide were determined in competitive binding assays using [I\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH as described in 7.1 below. All peptides were prepared in the TFA acid salt form, except for the peptides of Examples 43, 46 and 67, which were prepared in the acetate salt form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe syntheses of some specific peptides of the invention are illustrated below. These peptides were prepared using solid phase peptide synthesis by means of a Symphony Multiplex Peptide Synthesizer (Rainin Instrument Company/Protein Technologies Inc) automated peptide synthesizer.\n\n\n \nStep 1: Coupling of Orn\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Sierber resin 9-Fmoc-Aminoxanthen-3-yloxy-polystyrene resin (0.39 mol/g, ChemPep Inc., #151902) was swelled in 3×5 mL of DMF for 10 min. Thereafter, Fmoc was deprotected using 2×5 mL of 20% piperidine in DMF for 10 min. The resin was then washed in 6×5 mL DMF for 30 sec. 5 mL of 200 mM Fmoc-Orn(Alloc)-OH in DMF and 5 mL 200 mM HBTU containing 400 mM NMM in DMF was added and after 30 min the resin was washed with 3×5 mL DMF for 30 sec.\n\n\n \nStep 2: Coupling of Next 6 Amino Acids (AA)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe resin from step 1 was first swelled in 3×5 mL of DMF for 30 sec, Fmoc was deprotected using 2×5 mL of 20% piperidine in DMF for 10 min and then washed with 6×5 mL DMF for 30 sec. 5 mL of 200 mM Fmoc-AA-OH solution and 5 mL 200 mM HBTU containing 400 mM NMM in DMF was added and after 30 min the resin was washed with 3×5 mL DMF for 30 sec.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis step was repeated for each amino acid (AA).\n\n\n \nStep 3: Acetylation\n\n\n \n \n \nFmoc was deprotected using 2×5 mL of 20% piperidine in DMF for 10 min and the resin was then washed with 3×5 mL DMF for 30 sec. Thereafter, 5 mL of 50% Ac\n2\nO/DMF solution was added and after 30 min the peptide resin was washed with 3×5 mL DMF for 30 sec and 6×5 mL DCM for 30 sec.\n\n\n \nStep 4: Allyl/Alloc Deprotection\n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptide resin (0.6 mmol) was mixed with phenylsilane (Oakwood Chemical, #S13600) (20 eq.) in 20 mL of DCM and bubbled with nitrogen for 5 min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0) (Strem Chemicals, Inc., #46-2150) (0.2 eq.) was added and the mixture was agitated with nitrogen for 1 hour. The procedure was repeated one time for 1 hour and an additional time for 30 min with fresh reagents. The treated peptide resin was then washed with DCM x 3 and DMF x 3.\n\n\n \nStep 5: Lactam Formation\n\n\n \n \n \nThe lactam ring was formed on the peptide resin using TBTU (2 eq.) and ethyldiisopropylamine (DIEA) (4 eq.) in 20 mL DMF for 1 hour. A second coupling may be needed if a positive Kaiser Ninhydrin test is observed.\n\n\n \nStep 6: Peptide Cleavage\n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptide resin (0.6 mmol) was mixed with 20 mL of 5% sodium diethyldithio-carbamate trihydrate (NaCS\n2\nNEt\n2\n, Aldrich, #228680) in DMF for 20 min and then washed with DMF x 3, DCM x 3 and diethyl ether x 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resin (0.6 mmol) was then stirred in a 25 mL of TFA/TIS/H2O (90:5.0:5.0 v/v/v) for 2.5 hours. The resin was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated to about 10 mL in volume and about 140 mL of cold diethyl ether (pre-cooled to about 0° C.) was added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mixture was vortexed, and then placed in the refrigerator (about −4° C.) for 1 h, centrifuged for 5 min at 2800 rpm, and the ether layer was decanted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide was washed with 90 mL of cold diethyl ether (pre-cooled to about 0° C.), vortexed, centrifuged for 5 min at 2800 rpm, and ether layer decanted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting solid was dissolved in 50% AcOH/H\n2\nO and stored at room temperature overnight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crude peptide solution was concentrated to afford solid crude peptide for HPLC purification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter HPLC purification, the peptide TFA salt was converted to peptide acetate salt using ion exchange (×100 eq.). The anion exchange resin used was Dowex SBR LC NG, OH-form (Supelco, Cat#14036-U).\n\n\n \nExample 46\n\n\nAc-Arg-cyclo(Glu-Gln-D-Phe(4-CN)-Arg-Trp-Orn)-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:51)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe procedure described above was followed in the preparation of the title peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acids added in step 2 were, in the order of being coupled, Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc-D-Phe(4-CN)—OH, Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Glu(OAll)-OH, and Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting peptide was purified by HPLC (column: Atlantis dC18 OBD™ 19×100 mm (5μ, Waters part #186001367) using 10% MeOH/H\n2\nO containing 0.1% TFA (solvent A) and 90% MeOH/H\n2\nO containing 0.1% TFA (solvent B). A gradient of 0%-5% of solvent B for 5 min and 5%-35% of solvent B for 30 min was used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide yield was 10%.\n\n\n \nExample 67\n\n\nAc-Arg-cyclo(Glu-Pro-D-Phe(4-F)-Arg-Trp-Orn)-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:72)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe procedure described above was followed in the preparation of the title peptide except for that 15 mL of 5% sodium diethyldithio-carbamate trihydrate in DMF, 16 mL of TFA/TIS/H\n2\nO and 90 mL+60 mL of diethyl ether were used in step 6. Moreover, the filtrate was concentrated to 5 mL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acids added in step 2 were, in the order of being coupled, Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc-D-Phe(4-F)—OH, Fmoc-Pro-OH, Fmoc-Glu(OAll)-OH, and Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting peptide was purified by HPLC (column: Atlantis dC18 OBD™ 19×100 mm (5μ, Waters part #186001367) using 10% MeOH/H\n2\nO containing 0.1% TFA (solvent A) and 90% MeOH/H\n2\nO containing 0.1% TFA (solvent B).

\n7.0 Tests and Assays Employed in Evaluation of the Peptides of the Present Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe melanocortin receptor-specific peptides of this invention may be tested by a variety of assay systems and animal models to determine binding, functional status and efficacy.\n\n\n \n7.1 Competitive Inhibition Assay Using [I\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH\n\n\n \n \n \nA competitive inhibition binding assay was performed for exemplified peptides according to the invention using membrane homogenates prepared from HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC4-R, hMC3-R, or hMC5-R, and from B-16 mouse melanoma cells (containing endogenous MC1-R). In some instances, HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC1-R were employed. Assays were performed in 96 well GF/B Millipore multiscreen filtration plates (MAFB NOB10) pre-coated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V). Membrane homogenates were incubated with 0.2 nM (for hMC4-R) 0.4 nM (for MC3-R and MC5-R) or 0.1 nM (for mouse B16 MC1-R or hMC1-R) [I\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH (Perkin Elmer) and increasing concentrations of test peptides of the present invention in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) with 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.3 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After incubation for 60 minutes at 37° C., the assay mixture was filtered and the membranes washed three times with ice-cold buffer. Filters were dried and counted in a gamma counter for bound radioactivity. Non-specific binding was measured by inhibition of binding of [I\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH in the presence of 1 μM NDP-α-MSH. Maximal specific binding (100%) was defined as the difference in radioactivity (cpm) bound to cell membranes in the absence and presence of 1 μM NDP-α-MSH. Radioactivity (cpm) obtained in the presence of test peptides was normalized with respect to 100% specific binding to determine the percent inhibition of [I\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH binding. Each assay was conducted in triplicate and the actual mean values are described, with results less than 0% reported as 0%. Ki values for test peptides of the present invention were determined using Graph-Pad Prism® curve-fitting software. Results from this assay are presented herein (see 6.1). For some peptides, a mean value of more than two values is presented.\n\n\n \n7.2 Assay for Agonist Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nAccumulation of intracellular cAMP was examined as a measure of the ability of peptides of the present invention to elicit a functional response in HEK-293 cells that express MC4-R. Confluent HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC4-R were detached from culture plates by incubation in enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer. Dispersed cells were suspended in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM glutamine, 0.5% albumin and 0.3 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 0.5×10\n5 \ncells per well and pre-incubated for 10 minutes. Cells were exposed for 15 minutes at 37° C. to peptides of the present invention dissolved in DMSO (final DMSO concentration of 1%) at a concentration range of 0.05-5000 nM in a total assay volume of 200 pt. NDP-α-MSH was used as the reference agonist. cAMP levels were determined by an HTRF® cAMP cell-based assay system from Cisbio Bioassays utilizing cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP, with plates read on a Perkin-Elmer Victor plate reader at 665 and 620 nM. Data analysis was performed by nonlinear regression analysis with Graph-Pad Prism® software. The maximum efficacies of test peptides of the present invention were compared to that achieved by the reference melanocortin agonist NDP-α-MSH, used as full agonist benchmark in this context.\n\n\n \n7.3 High and Low Density hMC4-R Functional Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nA HEK293 cell line transfected with human MC4-R (Palatin Technologies, US, with license from the University of Michigan) was used. The human MC4-R was introduced to HEK293 by using the T-REx™ System, Invitrogen. The T-REx™ System employs a tetracycline-regulated mammalian expression system that uses regulatory elements from the \nE. coli \nTn10-encoded tetracycline (Tet) resistance operon. By use of the T-REx™ System, expression of the gene of interest, the human MC4-R gene, is repressed in the absence of tetracycline or doxycycline and induced in the presence of tetracycline or doxycycline (see T-REx™ System Manual, published by Invitrogen).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHEK293-T-REx-MC4-R cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco 11965), supplemented with L-Glutamine (Gibco 25030), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 200 μg/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen 46-0072) and 6 μg/mL Blasticidin (Invitrogen 46-1120) in 5% CO\n2 \nand 95% humidity at 37° C. T-150 flasks of cells at 75% confluence were incubated with two concentrations of doxycycline (0.1 ng/mL to provide a low density hMC4-R system and 10 ng/mL to provide a high density hMC4-R system) in 5% CO\n2 \nat 37° C. for 16-18 hours to induce MC4-R expression. On the day of the assay, the cells were washed with PBS (Gibco 14190) and harvested using cell dissociation buffer (Gibco 13150-016), then centrifuged and resuspended in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (+Ca, +Mg) (Gibco 14025), 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pH 7.4) (Sigma H0887), 1 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco 25030), 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma A3311) and 0.3 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX). Cells were then counted and volume was adjusted to 2.5×10\n5 \ncells per ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells were then dispensed into 96-well plates (BD 353916) in 198 μL (about 5×10\n4\n) cells/well and incubated for 10 minutes at 37° C. The compound to be tested was diluted with DMSO to a final concentration of 1 mM. Serial dilution was prepared in polypropylene removable 12-well library tube strips (VWR cat#83009-682). 120 μL of the 1 mM compound stock was pipetted in the second column on the plate. Using the Janus liquid handler the compound was serially diluted 1:10 (25 μL compound+225 μL DMSO) to a total of 9 concentrations (representing final assay concentrations ranging from 10\n−5 \nto 10\n−13 \nM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2 μL of the standard, [Nle\n4\n, D-Phe\n7\n]-alpha-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (NDP-α-MSH), or compound was added to the 96-well plate using the Janus robotic system. All assay samples were run in duplicate (i.e. each sample was in two low dox and two high dox plates, respectively). The plates were gently shaken and incubated for 15 minutes at 37° C. The reaction was stopped by adding 15 μL of lysis buffer per well and the plates were shakened for 30 minutes at room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgonist stimulation of the MC4-R activates adenylate cyclase, which is an enzyme that catalyses the formation 3′,5″-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Thus, agonist stimulation of the MC4-R increases the levels of cAMP. cAMP-levels were measured with the cAMP dynamic 2 HTRF kit (CisBio cat#62AM4PEC; see manual published by CisBio). cAMP levels were normalised against plate controls (1% DMSO for 0%, 400 nM NDP-α-MSH for 100%) and a calibration curve ranging from 712 nM to 0.04 nM cAMP (essentially as described in the CisBio HTRF kit). The plates were incubated on a shaker at room temperature for 1 hour and read on the Perkin-Elmer Victor plate reader at 665 and 620 nm. Fluoresence ratios were then calculated as described in the CisBio HTRF kit, with GraphPad Prism software used to plot the change in fluorescence percent values versus cAMP concentration using the variable slope dose response curve and, based on calculated cAMP concentrations, to determine is EC\n50 \nvalues and percent activation. Results from this assay are presented herein (see 8.0).\n\n\n \n7.4 Food Intake and Body Weight Change\n\n\n \n \n \nChange in food intake and body weight was evaluated for selected peptides administered by subcutaneous injection route. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Hilltop Lab Animals, Inc. (Scottdale, Pa.). Animals were individually housed in conventional polystyrene hanging cages and maintained on a controlled 12 hour on/off light cycle. Water and pelleted food (ProLab RMH 2500, W.F. Fisher & Son Inc.) was provided ad libitum. The rats were dosed subcutaneously with vehicle (3.2% mannitol/50 mM Tris buffer) or selected peptides (1.0 mg/kg). The changes in food intake for the 4 and 24 hour periods after dosing and the changes in body weight for the 24 hour period after dosing were determined. The changes in body weight and food intake for the 48 hour and 72 hour periods after dosing was also measured to determine reversal of changes in body weight and food intake effects back to baseline levels (not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFood intake (FI, 0-4 h and 0-24 h) and body weight (BW, 0-24 h) results from studies with 1.0 mg/kg subcutaneously of Examples 43, 46 and 67 and corresponding vehicle controls run in parallel are shown in Table 2 below, expressed as means±SEM (n=8-10).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDose\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBW change\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment\n\n\nTreatment\n\n\n(mg/kg, s.c.)\n\n\nn\n\n\nFI 0-4 h (g)\n\n\nFI 0-24 h (g)\n\n\n0-24 h (g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nVehicle\n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n10.53 ± 0.78 \n\n\n27.75 ± 1.00\n\n\n1.49 ± 0.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nRef Ex 2\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n10\n\n\n4.41 ± 0.48\n\n\n20.84 ± 1.01\n\n\n−0.38 ± 0.46 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nEx 43\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n10\n\n\n6.85 ± 0.55\n\n\n24.44 ± 0.85\n\n\n0.45 ± 0.35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nVehicle\n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n7.09 ± 0.39\n\n\n27.46 ± 1.16\n\n\n1.96 ± 0.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nRef Ex 2\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n8\n\n\n2.80 ± 0.27\n\n\n21.81 ± 1.04\n\n\n0.85 ± 0.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nEx 46\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n8\n\n\n3.71 ± 0.68\n\n\n20.56 ± 1.14\n\n\n−0.29 ± 0.55 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nVehicle\n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n7.76 ± 0.53\n\n\n25.71 ± 0.25\n\n\n2.25 ± 0.50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nRef Ex 2\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n8\n\n\n3.17 ± 0.42\n\n\n19.98 ± 0.60\n\n\n−0.27 ± 0.48 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nEx 67\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n8\n\n\n4.20 ± 0.66\n\n\n21.51 ± 1.27\n\n\n−0.05 ± 0.39 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n7.5 Induction of Penile Erection\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of peptides of the present invention to induce penile erection (PE) in male rats was evaluated with selected peptides. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g were kept on a 12 hour on/off light cycle with food and water ad libitum. All behavioral studies were performed between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Groups of 6-8 rats were administered peptides at a variety of doses via the subcutaneous injection route. Immediately after treatment, rats were placed into individual polystyrene cages (27 cm long, 16 cm wide, and 25 cm high) for behavioral observation, typically by remote video monitoring (High-speed Digital Video Recording System EVS-DSX-16000DVD-H with CCD cameras, Epic Systems Inc., St. Louis, Mo., USA) followed by blinded off-line scoring of video recordings. Rats were observed for one hour, and the number of yawns, grooming bouts and PEs were recorded in 10-minute bins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPE results from studies with 1.0-3.0 mg/kg subcutaneously of Examples 43, 46 and 67, along with Ref Ex 2, are shown in Table 3 below, expressed as total number of PE/rat, mean±SEM (n=7-11) and number of rats/group showing at least one erection over the study period (% responders).

about 0.1 (10%), such as greater than 0.2 (20%) or greater than about 0.3 (30%) or greater than about 0.4 (40%) or greater than about 0.5 (50%) or greater than about 0.6 (60%) %) or greater than about 0.7 (70%), or greater than about 0.8 (80%), or greater than about 0.9 (90%), or equal to or greater than about 1.0 (100%), in the above described high density hMC4-R system (i.e. HEK293TRexMC4R cells treated with 10 ng/ml doxycycline), based on maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase achievable by the compound in the same high density hMC4-R system where the maximal stimulation achieved by α-MSH or NDP-α-MSH is designated as an intrinsic activity of 1.0 (100%), provide agonist (full or partial) activity on the MC4 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA majority of the peptides of the Examples which were tested in the above described high density hMC4-R system (i.e. HEK293TRexMC4R cells treated with 10 ng/ml doxycycline) gave in said assay EC\n50 \nvalues for cAMP production of less than 0.05 μM, such as less than 0.01 μM, and in particular less than 0.001 μM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs seen from Table 4, peptides of the invention may lack intrinsic activity in the low density hMC4-R system and be full agonists in the high density hMC4-R system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs further seen from Table 4, peptides of the invention may be partial agonists in the above described low density hMC4-R system and full agonists in the above described high density hMC4-R system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs further seen from Table 4, peptides of the invention may be full agonists in both the low density hMC4-R system and in the high density hMC4-R system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being bound by any theory, it is believed that peptides that either lack intrinsic activity or are partial agonists in the above described low density hMC4-R system (i.e. peptides having intrinsic activity of from 0 to 70% in the low density hMC4-R system) and are partial or full agonists in the above described high density hMC4-R system (i.e. peptides having intrinsic activity of equal to or above 10%, or above 70%, in the high density hMC4-R system) will provide no or a reduced level of sexual effects resulting from MC4 receptor activation, e.g. penile erection, compared to peptides being full agonists in both the low and the high density hMC4-R systems. As explained above, these sexual effects are considered unwanted side-effects upon treatment of energy homeostasis and metabolism related, food intake related and/or energy balance and body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is thus believed that peptides according to the invention possess promising MC4 receptor affinity, efficacy and potency to be useful for treatment of diseases, disorders and/or conditions responsive to activation of the MC4 receptor, in particular energy homeostasis and metabolism related (e.g. diabetes), food intake related and/or energy balance and body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including obesity, overweight and diseases, disorders and/or conditions associated with obesity and/or overweight, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the invention has been described in detail with particular reference to these preferred embodiments, other embodiments can achieve the same results. Variations and modifications of the present invention will be obvious to those skilled in the art and it is intended to cover all such modifications and equivalents."
