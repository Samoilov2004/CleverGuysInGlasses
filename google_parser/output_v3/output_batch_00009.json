Description\n\n\n\n\nPRIORITY TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/779,099, filed May 13, 2010, now pending; which is a division of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/492,312, filed Jul. 25, 2006, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,781,436, issued Aug. 24, 2010; which claims the benefit of European Application Nos. 05107044.9, filed Jul. 29, 2005, and 05111072.4, filed Nov. 22, 2005. The entire contents of the above-identified applications are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nVasopressin is a 9 amino acid peptide mainly produced by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Three vasopressin receptors, all belonging to the class I G-protein coupled receptors, are known. The V1a receptor is expressed in the brain, liver, vascular smooth muscle, lung, uterus and testis, the V1b or V3 receptor is expressed in the brain and pituitary gland, the V2 receptor is expressed in the kidney where it regulates water excretion and mediates the antidiuretic effects of vasopressin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the periphery vasopressin acts as a neurohormone and stimulates vasoconstriction, glycogenolysis and antidiuresis. In the brain vasopressin acts as a neuromodulator and is elevated in the amygdala during stress (Ebner, K., C. T. Wotjak, et al. (2002). “Forced swimming triggers vasopressin release within the amygdala to modulate stress-coping strategies in rats.” \nEur J Neurosci \n15(2): 384-8). The V1a receptor is extensively expressed in the brain and particularly in limbic areas like the amygdala, lateral septum and hippocampus which are playing an important role in the regulation of anxiety. Indeed V1a knock-out mouse show a reduction in anxiety behavior in the plus-maze, open field and light-dark box (Bielsky, I. F., S. B. Hu, et al. (2003). “Profound Impairment in Social Recognition and Reduction in Anxiety-Like Behavior in Vasopressin V1a Receptor Knockout Mice.” \nNeuropsychopharmacology\n). The downregulation of the V1a receptor using antisense oligonucleotide injection in the septum also causes a reduction in anxiety behavior (Landgraf, R., R. Gerstberger, et al. (1995). “V1 vasopressin receptor antisense oligodeoxynucleotide into septum reduces vasopressin binding, social discrimination abilities, and anxiety-related behavior in rats.” \nRegul Pept \n59(2): 229-39).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe V1a receptor is also mediating the cardiovascular effects of vasopressin in the brain by centrally regulating blood pressure and heart rate in the solitary tract nucleus (Michelini, L. C. and M. Morris (1999). “Endogenous vasopressin modulates the cardiovascular responses to exercise.” \nAnn NY Acad Sci \n897: 198-211). In the periphery it induces the contraction of vascular smooth muscles and chronic inhibition of the V1a receptor improves hemodynamic parameters in myocardial infarcted rats (Van Kerckhoven, R., I. Lankhuizen, et al. (2002). “Chronic vasopressin V(1A) but not V(2) receptor antagonism prevents heart failure in chronically infarcted rats.” \nEur J Pharmacol \n449(1-2): 135-41).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, vasopressin receptor antagonists are useful as therapeutics in the conditions of dysmenorrhea, hypertension, chronic heart failure, inappropriate secretion of vasopressin, liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety and depressive disorders.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides compounds of formula (I)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

Alternatively, (IV) could react with an electrophilic reactant R\n1\n—X to give (V), which is then converted to the corresponding carboxylic acid derivative (II) with NaH/H\n2\nO in DMF (see \nJ. Org. Chem., \n1993, 10, 2862). Intermediate (V) can alternatively be obtained by treatment of an indole derivative (III-2) with trifluoroacetic anhydride in a suitable solvent, e.g. DMF, dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane. Addition of a suitable base may be advantageous.\n\n\n \nV1a Activity\n\n\nMaterial & Method:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe human V1a receptor was cloned by RT-PCR from total human liver RNA. The coding sequence was subcloned in an expression vector after sequencing to confirm the identity of the amplified sequence. To demonstrate the affinity of the compounds from the present invention to the human V1a receptor binding studies were performed. Cell membranes were prepared from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the expression vector and grown in 20 liter fermenters with the following protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n50 g of cells are resuspended in 30 ml freshly prepared ice cold Lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2 adjusted to pH=7.4+complete cocktail of protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics)). Homogenized with Polytron for 1 min and sonicated on ice for 2×2 minutes at 80% intensity (Vibracell sonicator). The preparation is centrifuged 20 min at 500 g at 4° C., the pellet is discarded and the supernatant centrifuged 1 hour at 43,000 g at 4° C. (19′000 rpm). The pellet is resuspended in 12.5 ml Lysis buffer+12.5 ml Sucrose 20% and homogenized using a Polytron for 1-2 min. The protein concentration is determined by the Bradford method, and aliquots are stored at −80° C. until use. For binding studies 60 mg Yttrium silicate SPA beads (Amersham) are mixed with an aliquot of membrane in binding buffer (50 mM Tris, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n) for 15 minutes with mixing. 50 ul of bead/membrane mixture is then added to each well of a 96 well plate, followed by 50 ul of 4 nM 3H-Vasopressin (American Radiolabeled Chemicals). For total binding measurement 100 ul of binding buffer are added to the respective wells, for non-specific binding 100 ul of 8.4 mM cold vasopressin and for compound testing 100 ul of a serial dilution of each compound in 2% DMSO. The plate is incubated 1 h at room temperature, centrifuged 1 min at 1000 g and counted on a Packard Top-Count. Non-specific binding counts are subtracted from each well, and data is normalized to the maximum specific binding set at 100%. To calculate an IC 50 the curve is fitted using a non-linear regression model (XLfit) and the Ki is calculated using the Cheng-Prussoff equation.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEx.

Such pharmaceutical compositions can be in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragées, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The pharmaceutical compositions also can be in the form of suppositories or injectable solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, in addition to one or more compounds of the invention, contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic excipients for the production of tablets, coated tablets, dragées, and hard gelatin capsules. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc can be used as such excipients e.g. for tablets, dragées and hard gelatin capsules. Suitable excipients for soft gelatin capsules are e.g. vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols etc. Suitable excipients for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are e.g. water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose etc. Suitable excipients for injection solutions are e.g. water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils etc. Suitable excipients for suppositories are e.g. natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, the pharmaceutical compositions can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants.
