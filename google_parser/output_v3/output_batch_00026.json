Field of the Invention \n\n\n The present invention relates to anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies or antibody fragments and methods of using them. \n\n\n4. Background of the Invention \n\n\n Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) is an Ig-like cell adhesion molecule. ICAM-1 binds integrins promoting cell-cell adhesion. In humans ICAM-1 is also a receptor for the major group of Human Rhinoviruses (HRV) and for several of the human Coxsackie A viruses (CV-A). In addition, ICAM-1 is one of the endothelial adhesion molecules that bind Plasmodium falciparum-mfected erythrocytes. \n\n\n Rhinoviruses cause the common cold. Some people get complications from a cold. A cold can sometimes lead to acute bronchitis, croup, pneumonia, sinusitis, or strep throat. People with chronic lung diseases like asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), are especially vulnerable to complications. This is often termed COPD \n\n\nexacerbation, and can be extremely serious for suffers of COPD or others with already impaired respiratory function. \n\n\n COPD is a major cause of disability, and it's the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. More than 12 million people are currently diagnosed with COPD. An additional 12 million likely have the disease and don't even know it. COPD blocks airflow and makes it increasingly difficult for a sufferer to breathe. COPD is caused by damage to the airways that eventually interferes with the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs. COPD includes chronic obstructive bronchitis and emphysema and often both. \n\n There are few treatments for the common cold, and the risks associated with infection are very significant for suffers of COPD or others who have impaired respiratory function. \n\n\n5. Summary of the Invention \n\n\n There is a need for treatments and preventatives for rhinovirus infections and the ensuing complications - complications which are particularly dangerous for sufferers of COPD and others who have impaired respiratory function. One class of agents are agents that prevent or decrease the likelihood that rhinovirus can effectively enter and infect cells by, for example, agents that bind specifically to IC AM- 1 and prevent rhinoviral binding to ICAM- 1. Of particular interest are agents that do this without interfering with or otherwise affecting the other normal functions of ICAM-1, such as the roles of ICAM-1 in cell adhesion and immune function. Moreover, ICAM-1 plays an important role in the normal immune response, and thus there is a need for compositions and methods that can be used to prevent ICAM-1 mediated viral entry into cells without inhibiting the normal functions of ICAM-1 in immunity. \n\n\n The present invention relates to anti-ICAM-1 antibodies or antibody fragments and methods of using them. In certain embodiments, anti-ICAM-1 antibodies or antibody fragments of the invention inhibit binding of human ICAM-1 to human rhinovirus, and do not substantially inhibit binding of human ICAM-1 to LFA1. In certain aspects, the invention provides nucleic acids encoding the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies of the invention. In certain aspects, the invention provides methods for producing anti-ICAM-1 antibodies of the invention. In certain aspects, the invention provides methods of treating or preventing rhinovirus infection in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody of the invention. \n\n\n6. Brief Description of the Figures \n\n\n Figures 1A and IB show representative plots of the inhibitory activity of several\n\n\nICAM-1 specific clones isolated from a phage display library (ICM 10064, 10088, 10098, and 10103), an irrelevant control (CAT002) and the commercially available anti-ICAM-1 murine antibody 15.2 (Calbiochem) in the human ICAM-1:HRV binding assay (Panel A) and the ICAM-1:LFA-1 binding assay (Panel B). Clones ICM10098 and 10103 as well as the 15.2 antibody show at least partial inhibition of HRV:ICAM-1 binding and full inhibition of LFA- 1:ICAM-1 binding. Clones ICM10064 and 10088 completely inhibit HRV binding and have minimal inhibitory activity on LFA-1:ICAM-1 binding. \n\n Figures 2A and 2B show representative plots of the inhibitory activity of several ICAM-1 specific clones isolated from a phage display library (ICM 10064, 10088, 10098, and 10103), an irrelevant control (COLIN IgG2) and the commercially available anti-ICAM-1 murine antibody 14C11, R&D Systems in the HeLa-OHIO CPE assay for HRV- 16 (Panel A) and HRV-14 (Panel B) serotypes. The data from these studies are summarized in Table 2. \n\n\n Figure 3 shows representative plots of the inhibitory activity of clones ICM10064, 10088, 10098, and 10103, an irrelevant control (COLIN), commercially available anti- ICAM-1 murine antibodies 14C11, and 15.2 and hlA2 IgG2 in the Jurkat Adhesion Assay. The data from these studies are summarized in Table 2. \n\n\n Figures 4A and 4B show the specificity ELISA results for representative anti-ICAM-1 antibodies binding to a panel of ICAM- 1 related molecules. The binding specificity of the parental antibodies ICM 10064 and ICM 10088 (at 33.3 nM IgG) is shown in Panel A, and the optimized germlined version of Icmo0191 (at 33.3 nM IgG) is shown in Panel B. These binding data show that both parental ICM10064 and ICM 10088 human antibodies and the optimized germlined antibodies derived from the ICM 10064 line are specific for human ICAM-1 domain 1 and do not bind ICAM from mouse or cynomolgus monkey. \n\n\n Figure 5 shows a schematic of the ICAM-1 structure and the interaction of ICAM- 1 domain 3 with Mac- 1 and the interactions of ICAM- 1 domain 1 with HRV and LFA- 1. \n\n\nPlasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes also interact with ICAM-1 domain 1 at a region that overlaps with the HRV interaction region. Also indicated with brackets are the putative interactions of ICAM-1 with clones ICM10098, ICM10103, ICM10064, ICM10088 and the commercial antibodies RRl/1 and hlA2 IgG2 based on their binding and functional activities including HRV/LFA-1 inhibition, and cross-reactivity with non-human primate (NHPX) ICAM-1. \n\n\n Figure 6 provides alignments of the amino acid sequences of the CDR3 randomized light chains for the selected antibodies from the ICM 10064 lineage.

These antibodies constitute Panel 2. The sequences shown in (A) are represented by SEQ ID NOs: 2, 172, 182, 202, 212, 222, 232, 242, 262, 272, 282 and 302, respectively. The sequences shown in (B) are represented by SEQ ID NOs:7, 177, 187, 207, 217, 227, 237, 247, 267, 277, 287 and 307, respectively. \n\n\n Figures 9A and 9B provide alignments of the germlined/N95aS heavy (A) and light (B) chain amino acid sequences of the parent ICM 10064 antibody and the antibodies from the second generation ribosome display library from the ICM10064 lineage.

The method may be used as shown here for screening molecules that inhibit the interaction of HRV with ICAM. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) occurs between the donor (europium cryptate labeled ICAM-Fc), and the acceptor fluorophore (IC AM-D 1/5-FLAG in complex with anti-FLAG XL\n665\n), when both fluorophores are in close proximity on the surface of a live HRV. The presence of an inhibitor of the ICAM- 1/HRV interaction such as an anti-ICAM scFv will reduce the FRET signal. 7. Detailed Description \n\n\n (i) Introduction \n\n\n The present invention provides antibodies, including human, humanized and/or chimeric forms, as well as fragments, derivatives/conjugates and compositions thereof that bind to ICAM-1. The anti-ICAM-1 antibodies and antibody fragments of this disclosure are also herein referred to as antibodies of the invention. \n\n\n The present anti-ICAM-1 antibodies and antibody fragments of this disclosure are useful for diagnosing and/or preventing and/or treating and/or alleviating one or more \n\n symptoms of HRV infection and/or a disease exacerbated by Human Rhinoviruses (HRV) infection such as a chronic lung disease, e.g., COPD or asthma. \n\n\n ICAM-1 also known as CD54 is an Ig-like cell adhesion molecule. ICAM-1 is an endothelial- and leukocyte-associated transmembrane protein known for its important role in stabilizing cell-cell interactions and facilitating leukocyte endothelial transmigration. The presence of heavy glycosylation and other structural characteristics of ICAM-1 provide binding sites on ICAM-1 for numerous ligands. ICAM-1 possesses binding sites for a number of immune-associated ligands such as, Macrophage Adhesion Ligand- 1 (Mac-1), Leukocyte Function Associated Antigen- 1 (LFA- 1), and Fibrinogen. These three proteins are generally expressed on endothelial cells and leukocytes, and they bind to ICAM-1 to facilitate transmigration of leukocytes across vascular endothelia in processes such as extravasation and the inflammatory response. Via interaction with these proteins, ICAM-1 plays a role in proper functioning of the normal immune system. \n\n\n In humans, ICAM-1 is also a receptor for the major group of HRV and for the Coxsackie A viruses (CV-A), and the interaction between ICAM-1 and these viruses promotes viral entry into various cell types. Rhinovirus attachment is confined to the BC, CD, DE, and FG loops of the amino-terminal Ig-like domain (Dl) at the end of ICAM-1 that is distal to the cellular membrane. There are extensive charge interactions between ICAM- 1 and HRV, which are mostly conserved in both major and minor receptor groups of rhinoviruses. In addition, the binding site for Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes is located in domain Dl and partially overlaps the HRV-binding site. Specific amino acids known to be involved in HRV, LFA, and Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes binding to ICAM-1 are shown in Figure 4 of Bella et al., PNAS, 95(8): 4140-4145 (1998), incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. \n\n\n HRV infection causes neutrophil influx with increased inflammatory cytokines. Host inflammatory responses, particularly IL-8, play key roles in pathogenesis of common cold symptoms. In patients with chronic lung diseases this can lead to exacerbation of the symptoms of the underlying respiratory condition. Symptoms of viral infection precede two thirds of COPD exacerbations. 40% of hospitalized acute exacerbation patients have HRV present in nasal and/or sputum samples. Thus, preventing HRV infection among patients with COPD or other significant respiratory conditions represents an important intervention that could significantly reduce the risk of COPD exacerbation and significantly improve the health of patients with COPD and other serious respiratory conditions. Thus, the present compositions and methods can be useful in treating and preventing COPD exacerbation by \n\n preventing or decreasing HRV infection - particularly in patients with COPD and other respiratory conditions. \n\n\n It would be advantageous for preventing or inhibiting HRV infection to develop an inhibitor that specifically inhibits HRV binding to ICAM- 1 (thus preventing HRV entry into these cells) but which has little or no effect on the normal functions of ICAM- 1 , such as LFA binding. Such inhibitors could be used to block HRV infection without interfering with the normal and advantageous role of ICAM-1 in the immune system. However, given that the binding sites on ICAM-1 for both LFA-1 and HRV are close together on the Dl domain, it was not clear, a priori, that such a specific inhibitor capable of disrupting HRV/ICAM-1 binding without substantially interfering with LFAl/ICAM-1 binding could be generated or that such antibodies would also inhibit the entry of HRV and CV-A. The present disclosure is based on the identification and characterization of antibodies including panels of human antibodies having these unique and advantageous features. These antibodies are described in detail herein. In addition, the antibodies of the invention are expected to block the binding of Plasmodium falciparum-inf ected erythrocytes to endothelial cells. \n\n\n As used herein, the terms \"antibody\" and \"antibodies\", also known as \n\n\nimmunoglobulins, encompass monoclonal antibodies (including full-length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies formed from at least two different epitope binding fragments (e.g., bispecific antibodies), human antibodies, chimeric antibodies (including, for example, humanized antibodies), camelised antibodies, antibody fragments that exhibit the desired biological activity (e.g. the antigen binding portion) including: single- chain Fvs (scFv), single-chain antibodies, single domain antibodies, domain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab')2 fragments, disulfide-linked Fvs (dsFv), and anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention), intrabodies, and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. In particular, antibodies include \n\n\nimmunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active fragments of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain at least one antigen-binding site. Immunoglobulin molecules can be of any isotype (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), subisotype (e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2) or allotype (e.g., Gm, e.g., Glm(f, z, a or x), G2m(n), G3m(g, b, or c), Am, Em, and Km (1, 2 or 3)). Antibodies may be derived from any mammal, including, but not limited to, humans, monkeys, pigs, horses, rabbits, dogs, cats, mice, etc., or other animals such as birds (e.g. chickens). \n\n\n Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light \n\n chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains (CH). Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain (CL) at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Light chains are classified as either lambda chains or kappa chains based on the amino acid sequence of the light chain constant region. The variable domain of a kappa light chain may also be denoted herein as VK. In the context of the present invention, the term \"chimeric antibody\" generically refers to an antibody composed of portions derived from at least two different animal species, regardless of the contribution of each portion in the overall molecule. \n\n\n The antibodies of the invention include full length or intact antibody, antibody fragments, native sequence antibody or amino acid variants, human, humanized, post- translationally modified, chimeric or fusion antibodies, immunoconjugates, and functional fragments thereof. The antibodies can be modified in the Fc region to provide desired effector functions or serum half-life. As discussed in more detail in the sections below, with the appropriate Fc regions, the naked antibody bound on the cell surface can have enhanced cytotoxicity, e.g., via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or by recruiting complement in complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), or by recruiting nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express one or more effector ligands that recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell in antibody dependent cell- mediated phagocytosis (ADCP), or some other mechanism. Alternatively, where it is desirable to eliminate or reduce effector function, so as to minimize side effects or therapeutic complications, certain other Fc regions may be used. The Fc region of the antibodies of the invention can be modified to increase the binding affinity for FcRn and thus increase serum half-life. Alternatively, the Fc region can be conjugated to PEG or albumin to increase the serum half-life, or some other conjugation that results in the desired effect. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antibody competes for binding or bind substantially to, the same epitope as the antibodies of the invention. Antibodies having one or more biological characteristics (e.g., potency, ICAM-1 affinity, effector function, ortholog binding affinity, neutralization, etc.) of the present anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies of the invention are also contemplated, e.g., an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody which has the biological characteristics of a \n\n monoclonal antibody comprising a VH amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 292 and a VL amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 297. \n\n\n The invention provides a composition comprising an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody of the invention and a carrier. For the purposes of treating and/or preventing disease associated with or exacerbated by HRV (e.g. HRV-14, HRV- 16) or CV-A (e.g. CV-A21, CV-A16), or Plasmodium falciparum compositions can be administered to the patient in need of such treatment, wherein the composition can comprise one or more anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies present as an immunoconjugate or as the naked antibody. In a further embodiment, the compositions can comprise these antibodies in combination with other therapeutic agents such as bronchodilators, such as ipratropium, tiotropium, salmeterol, or formoterol, steroids and antibiotics. In certain embodiments, the compositions can comprise these antibodies in combination with surgery such as lung volume reduction surgery or lung transplantation. In certain embodiments, the compositions can comprise these antibodies in combination with therapy such as oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation or smoking cessation. \n\n\n The invention also provides formulations comprising an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody of the invention and a carrier. In one embodiment, the formulation is a therapeutic formulation comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n\n In certain embodiments the invention provides methods useful for treating an HRV and/or CV-A, and/or Plasmodium falciparum associated or exacerbated disease /condition and/or preventing and/or alleviating one or more symptoms of such a disease/condition in a mammal, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the anti-ICAM- 1 antibody to the mammal. The antibody therapeutic compositions can be administered short term (acute) or chronic, or intermittently as directed by physician. By way of example, the antibodies of the present disclosure can be used to help treat or prevent COPD exacerbation or the exacerbation of other respiratory conditions. Such respiratory conditions are exacerbated by rhinovirus infection. The antibodies of the present disclosure can be used to help treat or prevent malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum infection. \n\n\n In certain embodiments the invention also provides articles of manufacture comprising at least an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody, such as sterile dosage forms and kits. The kits containing anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies find use e.g., for ICAM- 1 cell killing assays, for purification or immunoprecipitation of ICAM-1 from cells. For example, for isolation and purification of ICAM-1, the kit can contain an anti-ICAM-1 antibody coupled to beads (e.g., sepharose beads). Kits can be provided which contain the antibodies for detection and \n\n quantitation of ICAM-1 in vitro, e.g. in an ELISA or a Western blot. Such antibody useful for detection may be provided with a label such as a fluorescent or radiolabel. \n\n\n (ii) Terminology \n\n\n Before describing the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to specific compositions or process steps, as such may vary. It must be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular form \"a\", \"an\" and \"the\" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. \n\n\n Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention is related. For example, the Concise Dictionary of Biomedicine and Molecular Biology, Juo, Pei-Show, 2nd ed., 2002, CRC Press; The Dictionary of Cell and Molecular Biology, 3rd ed., 1999, Academic Press; and the Oxford Dictionary Of Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Revised, 2000, Oxford University Press, provide one of skill with a general dictionary of many of the terms used in this invention. \n\n\n Amino acids may be referred to herein by either their commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission. Nucleotides, likewise, may be referred to by their commonly accepted single-letter codes. \n\n\n The numbering of amino acids in the variable domain, complementarity determining region (CDRs) and framework regions (FR), of an antibody follow, unless otherwise indicated, the Kabat index as set forth in Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991). Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insertion (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc according to Kabat) after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a \"standard\" Kabat numbered sequence. Maximal alignment of framework residues frequently requires the insertion of \"spacer\" residues in the numbering system, to be used for the Fv region. In addition, the identity of certain individual residues at any given Kabat site number may vary from antibody chain to antibody chain due to interspecies or allelic divergence. \n\n The constant region of the heavy chain of IgG may be divided into four smaller domains, CHI , hinge, CH2 and CH3. As used herein \"Fc region\" and similar terms encompass at least the CH2 and CH3 domain and may further comprise a portion of the hinge region and may include the entire hinge region. It will be understood that the numbering of the Fc amino acid residues is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al. (Ibid). The \"EU index as set forth in Kabat\" refers to the EU index numbering of the human IgGl Kabat antibody, while the \"Kabat index as set forth in Kabat\" refers to the Kabat index numbering of the IgGl Kabat antibody. Polymorphisms have been observed at a number of immunoglobulin positions (see, e.g., Kimm et al., 2001, J Mol Evol 53 : 1-9), and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the prior art may exist. \n\n\n (iii) Anti-ICAM-1 Antibodies \n\n\n In a first aspect, the invention provides purified or isolated antibodies or antibody fragments that immuno specifically bind to human ICAM-1 (and optionally ICAM- 1 from one or more other species). Such antibodies or antibody fragments are human or chimeric antibodies that inhibit binding of human ICAM- 1 to human rhinovirus, but do not substantially inhibit binding of human ICAM- 1 to LFA1. Further, these antibodies or antibody fragments comprise one or more characteristics selected from the group consisting of: \n\n\n (a) immunospecifically binds to human ICAM- 1 expressed on HeLa-OHIO cells with an affinity (KD) of less than 5 nanomolar, as assessed using DELFIA-based detection; \n\n\n (b) immunospecifically binds to human ICAM- 1 with an affinity (K\nD\n) of less than 1 micromolar, as assessed by surface plasmon resonance measurements of purified proteins; \n\n\n (c) does not substantially inhibit binding of a human ICAM-1 to MAC- 1 ; \n\n\n (d) can inhibit a cytopathic effect of human rhinovirus on HeLa cells in culture with an EC50 of less than 0.35 nM; \n\n\n (e) does not immunospecifically bind to human ICAM-2; \n\n\n (f) does not immunospecifically bind to human ICAM-3; \n\n\n (g) does not immunospecifically bind to human ICAM-5; \n\n\n (h) does not immunospecifically bind to human VCAM-1 ; \n\n\n (i) immunospecifically binds to human ICAM- 1 comprising a K56M polymorphism; and\n\n\n j) binds to the same or substantially the same epitope as an antibody having the VH amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 292 and a VL amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: \n\n 297. In certain embodiments, the antibody or antibody fragment has at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or has all ten of features (a)-(j) detailed above. It is understood that such antibodies or antibody fragment comprise at least one or more of the foregoing characteristics, but may possess other features. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antibody or antibody fragment is a human antibody or antibody fragment. In certain embodiments, the antibody or antibody fragment is purified. In certain embodiments, the antibody or antibody fragment is isolated. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antibody or antibody fragment does not substantially inhibit binding of human ICAM-1 to LFA1. By \"does not substantially inhibit binding\" is meant that the antibody or antibody fragment inhibits binding, as measured by an in vitro or in vivo binding assay, of human ICAM-1 to LFA1 (and/or MAC- 1, when specified) by less than 50% in comparison to the binding of human ICAM-1 to LFA1 (and/or MAC-1) when measured in the same assay and under the same conditions in the absence of the antibody or antibody fragment. In certain embodiments, \"does not substantially inhibit binding\" refers to inhibition of less than about 45%, less than about 35%, less than about 30%, less than about 25%, less than about 20%, less than about 18%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 8%, less than about 5%, or less than about 3% 2%, or about 1%. In a specific embodiment, the antibody or antibody fragment inhibits binding of human ICAM-1 to LFA1 by less than 30-50% as measured by an in vitro binding assay disclosed in Example 11 infra. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antibody or antibody fragment immuno specific ally binds to human ICAM-1 with a KD of less than 250 nanomolar, as assessed by surface plasmon resonance measurements of purified proteins. In certain embodiments, the K\nD\n under these conditions is less than 200, less than 150, less than 125, less than 100, less than 75, or less than 70 nanomolar. In certain embodiments, the KD under these conditions is less than 60, less than 50, less than 40, less than 30, less than 25, less than 20, less than 15, less than 10 nanomolar, or less than 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 nanomolar. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, antibody or antibody fragment immunospecifically binds to human ICAM-1 expressed on HeLA-OHIO cells with a KD of less than 5 nanomolar, as assessed using DELFIA-based detection. In certain embodiments, the K\nD\n under these conditions is less than 2 nanomolar, less than 1 nanomolar, less than 750 picomolar, less than 600 picomolar, less than 500 picomolar, less than 400 picomolar, less than 300 picomolar, less than 250 picomolar, or less than 200 picomolar. In certain embodiments, the KD under these conditions is less than 150 picomolar, less than 100 picomolar, less than 75 picomolar, or less than 50 picomolar. In certain embodiments, the K\nD\n under these conditions is \n\n approximately 50-200 picomolar, approximately 100-400 picomolar, approximately 200-400 picomolar, approximately 200-500 picomolar (as assessed using .DELFIA-based detection). \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antibody or antibody fragment does not substantially inhibit binding of human ICAM-1 to MAC-1. By \"does not substantially inhibit binding\" is meant that the antibody or antibody fragment inhibits binding, as measured by an in vitro or in vivo binding assay, of human ICAM-1 to MAC1 (and/or LFAl, when specified) by less than 50% in comparison to the binding of human ICAM-1 to MAC1 (and/or LFA-1) when measured in the same assay and under the same conditions. In certain embodiments, \"does not substantially inhibit binding\" refers to inhibition of less than about 45%, less than about 35%, less than about 30%, less than about 25%, less than about 20%, less than about 18%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 8%, less than about 5%, or less than about 3% 2%, or about 1%. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antibody or antibody fragment binds to the same or substantially the same epitope as an antibody having the VH amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 292 and a VL amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 297. An antibody that binds to substantially the same epitope as a reference antibody will, in this case, maintain the primary functional characteristic of inhibiting binding of human ICAM-1 to rhinovirus, but not substantially inhibiting the binding of human ICAM-1 to LFAl. Further, such an antibody is capable of competing with the reference antibody for binding to human IC AM- 1 - indicating that the two antibodies bind specifically to overlapping epitopes.. \n\n\n It should be understood that the foregoing functional characteristics may also be used to describe antibodies of the invention that are additionally described using structural criteria, such as the amino acid sequence of one or more CDR or the amino acid sequence of the VH and/or VL domain. The invention contemplates antibodies and antibody fragments that bind immuno specifically to human ICAM-1 (and optionally ICAM-1 from one or more other species) and inhibit the binding of human ICAM-1 to human rhinovirus, but which antibodies do not substantially inhibit the binding of human ICAM-1 to LFAl and/or MAC-1. Any such antibodies of the invention can be further described using any one or more (and in any combination) of the functional and structural features described herein. Moreover, any of the antibodies or antibody fragments of the invention, whether defined functional, structural, or using a combination of functional and structural features, can be used in any of the methods describes herein. By way of example, antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention can be used diagnostically to detect ICAM-1 expression in vitro or in vivo. By way of further example, antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention can be used to inhibit human \n\n rhinovirus infection and to help treat or prevent exacerbation of respiratory conditions in susceptible patients. \n\n\n Provided herein are numerous examples of anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies and antibody fragments having the functional features described above.

Particular examples of antibodies having these features are provided in Table 8 and/or Figures 6-9, particularly for antibodies related to the ICM10088 parent antibody. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies are isolated and/or purified and/or pyrogen free antibodies. The term \"purified\" as used herein, refers to other molecules, e.g. polypeptide, nucleic acid molecule that have been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Thus, in one embodiment the antibodies of the invention are purified antibodies wherein they have been separated from one or more components of their natural environment. The term \"isolated antibody\" as used herein refers to an antibody which is substantially free of other antibody molecules having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds to ICAM-1 is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than ICAM-1; however a bi- or multi- specific antibody molecule is an isolated antibody when substantially free of other antibody molecules). Thus, in one embodiment the antibodies of the invention are isolated antibodies wherein they have been separated from antibodies with a different specificity. Typically an isolated antibody is a monoclonal antibody. An isolated antibody that specifically binds to an epitope, isoform or variant of human ICAM-1 may, however, have cross-reactivity to other related antigens, e.g., from other species (e.g., ICAM-1 species homologs). Moreover, an isolated antibody of the invention may be substantially free of one or more other cellular materials and/or chemicals and is herein referred to as an isolated and purified antibody. In one embodiment of the invention, a combination of \"isolated\" monoclonal antibodies relates to antibodies having different specificities and being combined in a well defined composition. Methods of production and purification/isolation of the anti- ICAM- 1 antibodies are described below in more detail. This definition similarly applies to antibody fragments. In certain embodiments, an antibody of the invention may be a humanized antibody, a chimeric antibody or a human antibody. \n\n The isolated antibodies and antibody fragments of the present invention comprise antibody amino acid sequences disclosed herein encoded by any suitable polynucleotide, or any isolated or formulated antibody. In one embodiment, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibody binds human ICAM-1 and, thereby partially or substantially alters at least one biological activity of the ICAM-1 (e.g. receptor binding, catalytic activity, etc). The anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies of the invention immunospecifically bind at least one specified epitope specific to the ICAM-1 protein, peptide, subunit, fragment, portion or any combination thereof and do not specifically bind to other polypeptides. The at least one epitope can comprise at least one antibody binding region that comprises at least one portion of the ICAM-1 protein. The term \"epitope\" as used herein refers to a protein determinant capable of binding to an antibody. Epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural \n\n\ncharacteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. Conformational and non- conformational epitopes are distinguished in that the binding to the former but not the latter is lost in the presence of denaturing solvents. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the epitope is comprised of at least one extracellular, soluble, hydrophilic, external or cytoplasmic portion of human ICAM-1. The at least one specified epitope can comprise any combination of at least one amino acid sequence of at least 3 amino acid residues to the entire specified portion of contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO:481 and/or Genbank Accession Number: P05362. In one embodiment, the epitope is at least 4 amino acid residues, at least 5 amino acid residues, at least 6 amino acid residues, at least 7 amino acid residues, at least 8 amino acid residues or at least 9 amino acid residues to the entire specified portion of contiguous amino acids of the (SEQ ID NO:481 and/or Genbank Accession Number: P05362). In certain embodiments, the epitope can comprise any combination of at least one amino acid sequence of at least 3 amino acid residues to the entire specified portion of contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO:482. Specific amino acids known to be involved in HRV binding to ICAM-1 are shown in Figure 4 of Bella et al., PNAS, 95(8): 4140-4145 (1998), incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In certain embodiments, the epitope is at least 4 amino acid residues, at least 5 amino acid residues, at least 6 amino acid residues, at least 7 amino acid residues, at least 8 amino acid residues or at least 9 amino acid residues to the entire specified portion of contiguous amino acids of the known HRV binding region specified in Bella et al. In certain embodiments, the epitope can comprise any combination of at least one amino acid sequence of at least 3 amino acid residues to the entire specified portion of contiguous amino acids of the known HRV binding \n\n regions specified in Bella et al.. In certain embodiments, an anti-ICAM antibody or antibody fragment of the present invention binds immunospecifically to human ICAM-1 and also binds immunospecifically to ICAM- 1 from one or more mouse, rat, and cynomolgous monkey. In other embodiments, an anti-ICAM antibody or antibody fragment of the present invention binds immunospecifically to human ICAM-1 but does not bind immunospecifically to mouse and/or rat ICAM- 1. In other embodiments, an anti-ICAM antibody or antibody fragment of the present invention binds immunospecifically to human IC AM- 1 but does not bind immunospecifically to cynomolgous ICAM-1. \n\n\n Thus, in a specific embodiment the isolated/purified anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies of the invention immunospecifically bind to ICAM-1 having the amino acid sequence according to SEQ ID. NO. 481. In certain embodiments, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies of the invention also bind ICAM- 1 homologs or orthologs from different species. The species cross-reactive characteristics of the present antibodies are described below in more detail. The foregoing description applies equally to antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention. In certain embodiments, an antibody of the invention may be a humanized antibody, a chimeric antibody or a human antibody. In certain embodiments, the antibody or antibody fragment is a human antibody or antibody fragment that binds immunospecifically to human ICAM-1 (and optionally IC AM- 1 from one or more additional species) and inhibits binding of ICAM- 1 to human rhinovirus, but which antibody or antibody fragment does not substantially inhibit binding of human ICAM-1 to LFA-1 and/or MAC-1. Thus, in certain embodiments, the epitope specifically bound by the anti-ICAM- 1 antibody or antibody fragment is such that an antibody or antibody fragment binding said antibody is capable of having the foregoing characteristics. \n\n\n (a) Variable Regions \n\n\n As used herein, the term \"parent antibody\" refers to an antibody which is encoded by an amino acid sequence used for the preparation of the variant or derivative, defined herein. The parent polypeptide may comprise a native antibody sequence (z. e. , a naturally occurring, including a naturally occurring allelic variant) or an antibody sequence with pre-existing amino acid sequence modifications (such as other insertions, deletions and/or substitutions) of a naturally occurring sequence. The parent antibody may be a humanized antibody, a chimeric antibody or a human antibody. In a specific embodiment, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies are variants of the parent antibody. As used herein, the term \"variant\" refers to an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody, which differs in amino acid sequence from a \"parent\" anti-ICAM- 1 \n\n antibody amino acid sequence by virtue of addition, deletion and/or substitution of one or more amino acid residue(s) in the parent antibody sequence. Such variants of the parental antibody retain the ability of the parent antibody to immunospecifically bind human ICAM- 1. However, in certain embodiments, the variants are improved in some manner relative to the parent antibody. For example, the variant antibodies may bind human ICAM-1 with higher affinity, may cross-react with ICAM-1 from one or more non-human animal, or may show even lower activity versus a binding site for LFA-1 and/or MAC-1. \n\n\n The antigen-binding portion of an antibody comprises one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., ICAM-1). It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term \"antigen- binding portion\" of an antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CHI domains; (ii) a F(ab')2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CHI domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR). Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) Science 242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term \"antigen-binding portion\" of an antibody. These antibody fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to those with skill in the art, and the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies. Antigen-binding portions can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact immunoglobulins . \n\n\n The present anti-ICAM-1 antibodies comprise at least one antigen binding domain. In one embodiment, the anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies comprise a VH having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO.2. In another embodiment, the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies comprise a VL having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 7. In yet another embodiment, the anti- ICAM-1 antibodies comprise a VH having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 2 and a VL having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 7. See Table 8 for a representation of \n\n VH and VL sequences encompassed in the present invention which can be present in any combination to form a present anti-ICAM-1 antibody. In certain embodiments, an anti- ICAM- 1 antibody of the invention comprises a combination of any of the VH and VL sequences according to Table 8, where in the antibody inhibits binding of human ICAM-1 to human rhinovirus, but does not substantially inhibit binding of human ICAM-1 to LFA and/or MAC-1. In one embodiment, the VH is selected from (SEQ ID NO: 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, 62, 72, 82, 92, 102, 112, 122, 132, 142, 152, 162, 172, 182, 192, 202, 212, 222, 232, 242, 252, 262, 272, 282, 292, 302 and 312). In another embodiment, the VL is selected from (SEQ ID NO: 17. 27, 37, 47, 57, 67, 77, 87, 97, 107, 117, 127, 137, 147, 157, 167, 177, 187, 197, 207, 217, 227, 237, 247, 257, 267, 277, 287, 297, 307 and 317). In certain \n\n\nembodiments, the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies are human or chimeric antibodies or antibody fragments. In certain embodiments, the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies are human antibodies or antibody fragments. In certain embodiments, the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies are human or chimeric antibodies or antibody fragments that immunospecifically bind to human ICAM-1 and inhibit binding of human ICAM-1 to human rhinovirus, but do not substantially inhibit binding of human ICAM-1 to LFA and/or MAC-1. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the purified anti-ICAM-1 antibodies comprise a VH and/or VL that has a given percent identify to at least one of the VH and/or VL sequences disclosed in Table 8. As used herein, the term \"percent (%) sequence identity\", also including \n\n\n\"homology\" is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues or nucleotides in the reference sequences, such as parent antibody sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Optimal alignment of the sequences for comparison may be produced, besides manually, by means of the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, 1981, Ads App. Math. 2, 482, by means of the local homology algorithm of Neddleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48, 443, by means of the similarity search method of Pearson and Lipman, 1988, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 85, 2444, or by means of computer programs which use these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, BLAST P, BLAST N and TFASTA in Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis.). \n\n\n In a specific embodiment, the anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies comprise a VH amino acid sequence having at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or having at least 100% identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2.

However, it is also contemplated, for any of the foregoing, that such variable domains, provided in any combination, may be present as part of a larger antibody, such as an antibody comprising an Fc region. \n\n\n The foregoing description applies equally to antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention. Moreover, the invention contemplates antibodies and antibody fragments having any combination of the structural and/or functional features described herein.

They are provided separately to illustrate the experimental results, as well as the relationships among certain antibodies identified. \n\n\nHowever, when a sequence identifier is used to describe the sequence of a particular antibody, it should be understood, unless otherwise specified, to refer to the underlying sequence itself without requiring or assuming a source of that sequence. (b) Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) \n\n\n While the variable domain (VH and VL) comprises the antigen-binding region; the variability is not evenly distributed through the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in segments called Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs), both in the light chain (VL or VK) and the heavy chain (VH) variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of the variable domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR, largely adopting a β-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the β-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see, Kabat et al., Supra). The three CDRs of the heavy chain are designated CDR-H1, CDR-H2, and CDR-H3, and the three CDRs of the light chain are designated CDR-Ll, CDR-L2, and CDR-L3. The Kabat numbering system is used herein. As such, CDR-H1 begins at approximately amino acid 31 (i.e., approximately 9 residues after the first cysteine residue), includes approximately 5-7 amino acids, and ends at the next tyrosine residue. CDR-H2 begins at the fifteenth residue after the end of CDR- Hl, includes approximately 16-19 amino acids, and ends at the next arginine or lysine residue. CDR-H3 begins at approximately the thirty third amino acid residue after the end of CDR-H2; includes 3-25 amino acids; and ends at the sequence W-G-X-G, where X is any amino acid. CDR-Ll begins at approximately residue 24 (i.e., following a cysteine residue); includes approximately 10- 17 residues; and ends at the next tyrosine residue. CDR-L2 begins at approximately the sixteenth residue after the end of CDR-Ll and includes approximately 7 residues. CDR-L3 begins at approximately the thirty third residue after the end of CDR-L2; includes approximately 7-11 residues and ends at the sequence F-G-X-G, where X is any \n\n amino acid. Note that CDRs vary considerably from antibody to antibody (and by definition will not exhibit homology with the Kabat consensus sequences). \n\n\n The present anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies and antibody fragments comprise at least one antigen binding domain that comprises at least one complementarity determining region (CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3). In one embodiment, the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies comprise a VH that comprises at least one VH CDR (e.g., CDR-H1, CDR-H2 or CDR-H3). In another embodiment, the anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies comprise a VL that comprises at least one VL CDR (e.g., CDR-L1, CDR-L2 or CDR-L3). \n\n\n In certain embodiments, an anti-ICAM-1 antibody or antibody fragment of the invention comprises a combination of any CDR-H1 sequence of Table 8, any CDR-H2 sequence of Table 8, any CDR-H3 sequence of Table 8, any CDR-L1 sequence of Table 8, any CDR-L2 sequence of Table 8 and any CDR-L3 sequence of Table 8, where in the antibody inhibits binding of human ICAM-1 to rhinovirus, but does not substantially inhibit binding of human ICAM-1 to LFA and/or MAC-1.

It should be understood that antibodies defined based on possessing any one or more of the foregoing properties possesses, at least, such one or more properties but may also possess other functional or structural characteristics. \n\n\n The invention contemplates antibodies and antibody fragments having any combination of the foregoing VH and VL CDRs with or without amino acid substitutions. For example, antibodies comprising: a VH CDRl having a sequence identical to SEQ ID NO: 3, a VH CDR2 having an amino acid sequence comprising one amino acid substitution relative to SEQ ID NO: 4, a VH CDR3 having an amino acid sequence comprising one amino acid substitution relative to SEQ ID NO: 5. By way of further example, antibodies comprising: a VL CDRl having an amino acid sequence identical to SEQ ID NO: 8, a VL CDR2 having an amino acid sequence comprising two substitutions relative to SEQ ID NO: 9, and a VL CDR3 having an amino acid sequence comprising three substitutions relative to SEQ ID NO: 10. All other combinations are similarly contemplated. In certain \n\n\nembodiments, the antibodies or antibody fragments are human or chimeric antibodies that immunospecifically bind to human ICAM-1 and inhibit binding of human ICAM-1 to rhinovirus, but do not substantially inhibit the binding of human ICAM-1 to LFA and/or MAC- 1. The foregoing description of the VH and VL CDRs is intended to refer to all possible combinations. Thus, for example, description of a VH CDRl having an amino acid sequence identical to or comprising 1, 2, or 3 amino acid substitutions relative to SEQ ID NO: 3 refers to any of the following embodiments: a VH CDRl having an amino acid sequence identical to SEQ ID NO: 3; a VH CDRl having an amino acid sequence identical to or comprising 1 amino acid residue substitution relative to SEQ ID NO: 3; a VH CDR 1 having an amino acid sequence comprising 1 amino acid residue substitution relative to SEQ ID NO: 3; a VH CDRl having an amino acid sequence identical to or comprising 1 or 2 amino acid residue substitutions relative to SEQ ID NO: 3; a VH CDRl having an amino acid sequence comprising 2 amino acid substitutions relative to SEQ ID NO:3; a VH CDRl \n\n having an amino acid sequence comprising 3 amino acid residue substitutions relative to SEQ ID NO: 3; etc. \n\n\n The present invention encompasses anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies comprising amino acids in a sequence that is substantially the same as an amino acid sequence described herein. Amino acid sequences that are substantially the same as the sequences described herein include sequences comprising conservative amino acid substitutions, as well as amino acid deletions and/or insertions. A conservative amino acid substitution refers to the replacement of a first amino acid by a second amino acid that has chemical and/or physical properties (e.g., charge, structure, polarity, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity) that are similar to those of the first amino acid. Conservative substitutions include replacement of one amino acid by another within the following groups: lysine (K), arginine (R) and histidine (H); aspartate (D) and glutamate (E); asparagine (N), glutamine (Q), serine (S), threonine (T), tyrosine (Y), K, R, H, D and E; alanine (A), valine (V), leucine (L), isoleucine (I), proline (P), phenylalanine (F), tryptophan (W), methionine (M), cysteine (C) and glycine (G); F, W and Y; C, S and T. Similarly contemplated is replacing a basic amino acid with another basic amino acid (e.g., replacement among Lys, Arg, His), replacing an acidic amino acid with another acidic amino acid (e.g., replacement among Asp and Glu), replacing a neutral amino acid with another neutral amino acid (e.g., replacement among Ala, Gly, Ser, Met, Thr, Leu, He, Asn, Gin, Phe, Cys, Pro, Trp, Tyr, Val). \n\n\n The foregoing applies equally to anti-ICAM antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention. Antibodies and antibody fragments having any one or more of the foregoing functional and structural characteristics are contemplated. \n\n\n(c) Framework regions \n\n\n The variable domains of the heavy and light chains each comprise four framework regions (FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4), which are the more highly conserved portions of the variable domains. The four FRs of the heavy chain are designated FR-H1, FR-H2, FR-H3 and FR- H4, and the four FRs of the light chain are designated FR-L1, FR-L2, FR-L3 and FR-L4. The Kabat numbering system is used herein, See Table 1, Kabat et al., Supra. As such, FR-H1 begins at position 1 and ends at approximately amino acid 30, FR-H2 is approximately from amino acid 36 to 49, FR-H3 is approximately from amino acid 66 to 94 and FR-H4 is approximately amino acid 103 to 113. FR-L1 begins at amino acid 1 and ends at \n\n\napproximately amino acid 23, FR-L2 is approximately from amino acid 35 to 49, FR-L3 is \n\n approximately from amino acid 57 to 88 and FR-L4 is approximately from amino acid 98 to 107. In certain embodiments the framework regions may contain substitutions according to the Kabat numbering system, e.g., insertion at 106A in FR-L1. In addition to naturally occurring substitutions, one or more alterations (e.g., substitutions) of FR residues may also be introduced in an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody. In certain embodiments, these result in an improvement or optimization in the binding affinity of the antibody for ICAM- 1. Examples of framework region residues to modify include those which non-covalently bind antigen directly (Amit et al, Science, 233:747-753 (1986)); interact with/effect the conformation of a CDR (Chothia et al, J. Mol. Biol, 196:901-917 (1987)); and/or participate in the VL-VH interface (US Patent No. 5,225,539). \n\n\n In another embodiment the FR may comprise one or more amino acid changes for the purposes of \"germlining\". For example, the amino acid sequences of selected antibody heavy and light chains are compared to germline heavy and light chain amino acid sequences and where certain framework residues of the selected VL and/or VH chains differ from the germline configuration (e.g., as a result of somatic mutation of the immunoglobulin genes used to prepare the phage library), it may be desirable to \"backmutate\" the altered framework residues of the selected antibodies to the germline configuration (i.e., change the framework amino acid sequences of the selected antibodies so that they are the same as the germline framework amino acid sequences). Such \"backmutation\" (or \"germlining\") of framework residues can be accomplished by standard molecular biology methods for introducing specific mutations (e.g., site-directed mutagenesis; PCR-mediated mutagenesis, and the like). In one embodiment, the variable light and/or heavy chain framework residues are backmutated. In another embodiment, the variable heavy chain of an antibody of the invention is \n\n\nbackmutated. In another embodiment, the variable heavy chain of an antibody of the invention comprises at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four or more \n\n\nbackmutations. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the VH of an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody of the invention may comprise FR1, FR2, FR3 and/or FR4 that has an amino acid sequence identity with the corresponding framework regions (i.e., FR1 of antibody X as compared to FR1 of antibody Y) of SEQ ID NO: 325, 326, 327 and/or 328, that is from about 90% to about 100%.

In one embodiment, the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies have a VL nucleotide sequence having at least, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or having about 100% identity to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:316. \n\n\n Substantially identical sequences may be polymorphic sequences, i.e., alternative sequences or alleles in a population. An allelic difference may be as small as one base pair. Substantially identical sequences may also comprise mutagenized sequences, including sequences comprising silent mutations. A mutation may comprise one or more residue \n\n changes, a deletion of one or more residues, or an insertion of one or more additional residues. \n\n\n The polynucleotides may be obtained, and the nucleotide sequence of the \n\n\npolynucleotides determined, by any method known in the art. For example, if the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is known, a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides (e.g., as described in Kutmeier et al., BioTechniques 17:242 (1994)), which, briefly, involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody, annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides, and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR. \n\n\n A polynucleotide encoding an antibody may also be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available, but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known, a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source (e.g., an antibody cDNA library, or a cDNA library generated from, or nucleic acid, preferably polyA+RNA, isolated from, any tissue or cells expressing the antibody, such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody ) by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3' and 5' ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify, e.g., a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art. \n\n\n Once the nucleotide sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence of the antibody is determined, the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc. (see, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1990, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al., eds., 1998, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY), to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence, for example to create amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions. \n\n\nBiological characteristics of the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies \n\n An antibody having a biological characteristic of a designated antibody is one which possesses one or more of the biological characteristics of that antibody which distinguish it from other antibodies that bind to the same antigen, ICAM-1. As used here, \"biological characteristics\" of an antibody refers to any one of biochemical, binding and functional characteristics, which are used to select antibodies for therapeutic, research, and diagnostic uses described below. For example, anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies may be the same or different with respect to epitope binding, targeting, affinity, neutralizing, internalizing, depletion, and cytotoxic properties of the antibody. \n\n\n The biochemical characteristics of the antibodies of the invention include, but are not limited to, isoelectric point (pi) and melting temperature (Tm). The binding characteristics of the antibodies of the invention include, but are not limited to, binding specificity, dissociation constant (KD), or its inverse, association constant (K\nA\n), or its component k\non\n or k\n0ff\n rates, epitope, ability to distinguish between various forms and/or preparations of ICAM-1 (e.g., recombinant, native, acetylated) and ability to bind soluble and/or immobilized antigen. The functional characteristics of the antibodies of the present invention include, but are not limited to; inhibition of HRV binding to ICAM- 1 without affecting LFA- 1 binding to ICAM- 1 or other normal functions of ICAM-1, neutralization/inhibition of CV-A infection, neutralization/inhibition of HRV infection, neutralization/inhibition of adhesion of \n\n\nPlasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes to the endothelium and protection in one or more ICAM-1 -related diseases or disorders. Described herein are the antibodies of the invention and their respective characteristics along with methods for the modification and fine tuning of those characteristics. Methods for measuring the characteristics of the antibodies are well known in the art, some of which are detailed below. \n\n\n (a) Biochemical Characteristics \n\n\n Antibodies like all polypeptides have an Isoelectric Point (pi), which is generally defined as the pH at which a polypeptide carries no net charge. It is known in the art that protein solubility is typically lowest when the pH of the solution is equal to the isoelectric point (pi) of the protein. As used herein the pi value is defined as the pi of the predominant charge form. The pi of a protein may be determined by a variety of methods including but not limited to, isoelectric focusing and various computer algorithms (see, e.g. , Bjellqvist et ah , 1993, Electrophoresis 14: 1023). In addition, the thermal melting temperatures (Tm) of the Fab domain of an antibody, can be a good indicator of the thermal stability of an antibody and may further provide an indication of the shelf-life. A lower Tm indicates more \n\n aggregation/less stability, whereas a higher Tm indicates less aggregation/ more stability. Thus, in certain embodiments antibodies having higher Tm are preferable. Tm of a protein domain (e.g., a Fab domain) can be measured using any standard method known in the art, for example, by differential scanning calorimetry (see, e.g., Vermeer et al., 2000, Biophys. J. 78:394-404; Vermeer et al., 2000, Biophys. J. 79: 2150-2154). \n\n\n Accordingly, in certain embodiments the present invention includes anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies of the invention that have certain preferred biochemical characteristics such as a particular isoelectric point (pi) or melting temperature (Tm). \n\n\n More specifically, in one embodiment, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies of the present invention have a pi ranging from 5.5 to 9.5. In still another specific embodiment, the anti- ICAM-1 antibodies of the present invention have a pi that ranges from about 5.5 to about 6.0, or about 6.0 to about 6.5, or about 6.5 to about 7.0, or about 7.0 to about 7.5, or about 7.5 to about 8.0, or about 8.0 to about 8.5, or about 8.5 to about 9.0, or about 9.0 to about 9.5. In other specific embodiments, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies of the present invention have a pi that ranges from 5.5-6.0, or 6.0 to 6.5, or 6.5 to 7.0, or 7.0-7.5, or 7.5-8.0, or 8.0-8.5, or 8.5- 9.0, or 9.0-9.5. Even more specifically, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies of the present invention have a pi of at least 5.5, or at least 6.0, or at least 6.3, or at least 6.5, or at least 6.7, or at least 6.9, or at least 7.1, or at least 7.3, or at least 7.5, or at least 7.7, or at least 7.9, or at least 8.1, or at least 8.3, or at least 8.5, or at least 8.7, or at least 8.9, or at least 9.1, or at least 9.3, or at least 9.5. In other specific embodiments, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies of the present invention have a pi of at least about 5.5, or at least about 6.0, or at least about 6.3, or at least about 6.5, or at least about 6.7, or at least about 6.9, or at least about 7.1, or at least about 7.3, or at least about 7.5, or at least about 7.7, or at least about 7.9, or at least about 8.1, or at least about 8.3, or at least about 8.5, or at least about 8.7, or at least about 8.9, or at least about 9.1, or at least about 9.3, or at least about 9.5. \n\n\n It is possible to optimize solubility by altering the number and location of ionizable residues in the antibody to adjust the pi. For example the pi of a polypeptide can be manipulated by making the appropriate amino acid substitutions (e.g. , by substituting a charged amino acid such as a lysine, for an uncharged residue such as alanine). Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, amino acid substitutions of an antibody that result in changes of the pi of said antibody may improve solubility and/or the stability of the antibody. One skilled in the art would understand which amino acid substitutions would be most appropriate for a particular antibody to achieve a desired pi. In one embodiment, a substitution is generated in an antibody of the invention to alter the pi. It is specifically \n\n contemplated that the substitution(s) of the Fc region that result in altered binding to FcyR (described supra) may also result in a change in the pi. In another embodiment, \n\n\nsubstitution(s) of the Fc region are specifically chosen to effect both the desired alteration in FcyR binding and any desired change in pi. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies of the present invention have a Tm ranging from 65°C to 120°C. In specific embodiments, the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies of the present invention have a Tm ranging from about 75°C to about 120°C, or about 75°C to about 85°C, or about 85°C to about 95°C, or about 95°C to about 105°C, or about 105°C to about 115°C, or about 115°C to about 120°C. In other specific embodiments, the ant-ICAM- 1 antibodies of the present invention have a Tm ranging from 75°C to 120°C, or 75°C to 85°C, or 85°C to 95°C, or 95°C to 105°C, or 105°C to 115°C, or 115°C to 120°C. In still other specific embodiments, the ant-ICAM-1 antibodies of the present invention have a Tm of at least about 65°C, or at least about 70°C, or at least about 75°C, or at least about 80°C, or at least about 85°C, or at least about 90°C, or at least about 95°C, or at least about 100°C, or at least about 105°C, or at least about 110°C, or at least about 115°C, or at least about 120°C. In yet other specific embodiments, the ant-IC AM- 1 antibodies of the present invention have a Tm of at least 65°C, or at least 70°C, or at least 75°C, or at least 80°C, or at least 85°C, or at least 90°C, or at least 95°C, or at least 100°C, or at least 105°C, or at least 110°C, or at least 115°C, or at least 120°C. \n\n\n (b) Binding Characteristics \n\n\n As described above, the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies of the invention immunospecifically bind at least one specified epitope or antigenic determinants of the ICAM- 1 protein, peptide, subunit, fragment, portion or any combination thereof either exclusively or preferentially with respect to other polypeptides. The term \"epitope\" or \"antigenic determinant\" as used herein refers to a protein determinant capable of binding to an antibody, wherein the term \"binding\" herein preferably relates to a specific binding. These protein determinants or epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have a specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. Conformational and non- conformational epitopes are distinguished in that the binding to the former but not the latter is lost in the presence of denaturing solvents. The term \"discontinuous epitope\" as used herein, refers to a conformational epitope on a protein antigen which is formed from at least two separate regions in the primary sequence of the protein. \n\n In certain embodiments, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies immuno specifically bind to human ICAM-1 and antigenic fragments thereof. In one embodiment, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies immuno specifically bind to (SEQ ID NO:481. and/or Genbank Accession NO: P05362), or at least any three contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 481. In another embodiments, the epitope is at least 4 amino acid residues, at least 5 amino acid residues, at least 6 amino acid residues, at least 7 amino acid residues, at least 8 amino acid residues or at least 9 amino acid residues to the entire specified portion of contiguous amino acids of the (SEQ ID NO: 481. and/or Genbank Accession NO: P05362). In one embodiment, the anti- ICAM- 1 antibodies immunospecifically bind a ICAM-1 polypeptide or antigenic fragments thereof, having at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or having at least 100% identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 481. In a further embodiment, the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies immunospecifically bind to a ICAM-1 polypeptide or antigenic fragments thereof, having at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or having at least 100% identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 481. In one embodiment, the anti- ICAM-1 antibodies immunospecifically bind to (SEQ ID NO:482, the Dl domain of ICAM- 1, or at least any three contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 482. In another embodiments, the epitope is at least 4 amino acid residues, at least 5 amino acid residues, at least 6 amino acid residues, at least 7 amino acid residues, at least 8 amino acid residues or at least 9 amino acid residues to the entire specified portion of contiguous amino acids of the (SEQ ID NO: 482. In one embodiment, the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies immunospecifically bind a ICAM-1 polypeptide or antigenic fragments thereof, having at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or having at least 100% identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 482. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention may bind epitopes conserved across species. In one embodiment, antibodies of the invention bind murine, non-human primate, rat, bovine, pig or other mammalian ICAM- 1 and antigenic fragments thereof. In one embodiment the antibodies of the invention may bind to one or more ICAM- 1 orthologs and or isoforms. In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention bind to ICAM-1 and antigenic fragments thereof from one or more species, including, but not limited to, mouse, rat, monkey, primate, and human. In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention may bind an epitope within humans across ICAM-1 homologs and/or isoforms and/or conformational variants and/or subtypes. \n\n\n The interactions between antigens and antibodies are the same as for other non- covalent protein-protein interactions. In general, four types of binding interactions exist \n\n between antigens and antibodies: (i) hydrogen bonds, (ii) dispersion forces, (iii) electrostatic forces between Lewis acids and Lewis bases, and (iv) hydrophobic interactions. Hydrophobic interactions are a major driving force for the antibody- antigen interaction, and are based on repulsion of water by non-polar groups rather than attraction of molecules (Tanford, 1978). However, certain physical forces also contribute to antigen-antibody binding, for example, the fit or complimentary of epitope shapes with different antibody binding sites. Moreover, other materials and antigens may cross-react with an antibody, thereby competing for available free antibody. \n\n\n Measurement of the affinity constant and specificity of binding between antigen and antibody is a pivotal element in determining the efficacy of therapeutic, diagnostic and research methods using the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies. \"Binding affinity\" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of the noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \"binding affinity\" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1: 1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n), which is calculated as the ratio koff/k\non\n. See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al., (1999) /. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881. Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described and exemplified herein, such as BIACORE™. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. \n\n\n The present anti-ICAM-1 antibodies have binding affinities for a ICAM- 1 epitope that include a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of less than lxlO\n_6\nM, lxlO\n_7\nM, lxlO\n_8\nM, lxlO\n_9\nM, lxlO\n\"10\nM, lxlO\n_11\nM, or less than lxlO\n~12\nM. In one embodiment, the anti-ICAM-1 \n\n\n -7 -8 -8 \n\n\nantibodies have a KD of less than 10\n\"\n M, less than 5x10\n\"\n M, less than 10\n\"\n M, less than 5x10\n\"\n \n9\nM, less than 10\n\"9\nM, less than 5xl0\n\"10\nM, less than 10\n\"10\nM, less than 5xl0\n\"n\nM, less than 10\n\"\n \nn\nM, less than 5xl0\n\"12\nM, or less than 10\n\"12\nM. In certain embodiments, anti-ICAM-1 antibodies have binding affinities for a ICAM-1 epitope that include a dissociation constant ( \nD\n) of between lxl0\n\"6\nM and lxl0\n\"10\nM, lxlO\n\"6\nM and lxlO\n\"n\nM, lxlO\n\"6\nM and lxlO\n~12\nM, lxlO\n\"7\nM and lxl0\n\"10\nM, lxlO\n\"7\nM and lxlO\n_11\nM, lxlO\n~7\nM and lxlO\n\"12\nM, lxl0\n\"8\nM and lxl0\n\"10\nM, lxl0\n\"8\nM and lxl0\n_11\nM, lxl0\n\"8\nM and lxlO\n\"12\nM, l lxlO\n\"9\nM and lxl0\n\"10\nM, lxlO\n_9\nM and lxl0\n_11\nM, or between lxlO\n_9\nM and lxlO\n_12\nM. In certain embodiments, the In \n\n certain embodiments, , anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies have binding affinities for a ICAM-1 epitope that include a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of between 5xl0\n_7\nM and lxlO\n_9\nM. K\nD\n is measured by BIACORE™ affinity data. In certain embodiments, KD is measured by cell binding. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies are high-affinity antibodies. By \"high- affinity antibody\" is meant an antibody which binds to a ICAM-1 epitope with an affinity less than 10\n\"8\nM (e.g., 10\n\"9\nM, 10\n\"10\n M, etc.). \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies are described as having a binding affinity of a specific molarity or better. \"Or better\" when used herein refers to a stronger binding, represented by a smaller numerical KD value. For example, an antibody which has an affinity for an antigen of \"0.6 nM or better\", the antibody's affinity for the antigen is <0.6 nM, i.e. 0.59 nM, 0.58 nM, 0.57 nM etc. or any value less than 0.6 nM. \n\n\n In certain embodiments the rate at which the anti- ICAM-1 antibodies dissociates from a ICAM-1 epitope may be more relevant than the value of the K\nD\n. In this instance the present anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies bind to a ICAM-1 with a k\n0\nf Of less than 5xl0\n~2\n s\n\"1\n, less than 10\n~2\n s\n\"1\n, less than 5xl0\n\"3\n s\n\"1\n, less than 10\n\"3\n s\n\"1\n, less than 5xl0\n\"4\n s\n\"1\n, less than 10\n\"4\n s\n\"\n \n1\n, less than 5xl0\n~5\n s\n\"1\n, less than 10\n\"5\n s\n\"1\n,. In certain other embodiments the rate at which the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies associate with a ICAM-1 epitope may be more relevant than the value of the KD. In this instance the present anti-ICAM-1 antibodies bind to a ICAM- 1 with a k\non\n rate of at least 10\n4\n M\n'\nV\n1\n, at least 5xl0\n4\n\n\n\n at least 10\n5\n M\n'\nV\n1\n, at least at least 10\n6\nMV. \n\n\n Determination of binding affinity can be measured using the specific techniques described further in the Example section, See Example 11 and methods well known in the art. One such method includes measuring the disassociation constant \"KD\" by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs \n\n\n 125 \n\n\nfor antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of ( I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti- Fab antibody-coated plate (see, e.g., Chen, et al., (1999) /. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (e.g., Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 μg/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (e.g., Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23° C). In a non-adsorbant plate (e.g., Nunc \n\n\n 125 \n\n\n #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM r\nJ\nI]-anti gen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of an anti-VEGF antibody, Fab- 12, in Presta et al., (1997) \n\n Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., 65 hours) to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 μΐ/well of scintillant (e.g., MicroScint-20; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter (e.g., Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. \n\n\n In another instance the KD value may be measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using, for example, a BIACORE™-2000 or a BIACORE™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25° C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at ~10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N- hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 110 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5 μg/ml (Ί3.2 uM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 μΐ/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, IM ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25° C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 μΐ/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\n0ff\n) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE™ Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. \n\n\n If the on-rate exceeds 10\n6\n M\n_1\n S\n_1\n by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25° C of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stir red cuvette. An \"on-rate\" or \"rate of association\" or \"association rate\" or \"k\non\n\" according to this invention can also be determined with the same surface plasmon resonance technique described above using a BIACORE™- 2000 or a BIACORE™- 3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) as described above. \n\n\n Methods and reagents suitable for determination of binding characteristics of an antibody of the present invention, or an altered/mutant derivative thereof (discussed below), \n\n are known in the art and/or are commercially available (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,849,425; \n\n\n6,632,926; 6,294,391 ; 6,143,574). Moreover, equipment and software designed for such kinetic analyses are commercially available (e.g. BIACORE\n®\n A100, and BIACORE \n®\n 2000 instruments; Biacore International AB, Uppsala, Sweden). \n\n\n In one embodiment, a binding assay may be performed either as direct binding assays or as competition-binding assays. Binding can be detected using standard ELISA or standard Flow Cytometry assays. In a direct binding assay, a candidate antibody is tested for binding to ICAM-1 antigen. Competition-binding assay, on the other hand, assess the ability of a candidate antibody to compete with a known anti-ICAM- 1 antibody or other compound that binds ICAM-1. In general any method that permits the binding of an antibody with a ICAM- 1 that can be detected is encompassed with the scope of the present invention for detecting and measuring the binding characteristics of the antibodies. One of skill in the art will recognize these well known methods and for this reason are not provided in detail here. These methods are also utilized to screen a panel of antibodies for those providing the desired characteristics. \n\n\n In certain embodiments an antibody of the invention immunospecifically binds to ICAM-1 and has one or more of the characteristics selected from the group consisting of: \n\n\n (a) immunospecifically binds to human ICAM-1 expressed on HeLa-OHIO cells with an affinity ( D) of less than 5 nanomolar, as assessed using DELFIA-based detection; \n\n\n (b) immunospecifically binds to human ICAM-1 with an affinity (KD) of less than 1 micromolar, as assessed by surface plasmon resonance measurements of purified proteins; \n\n\n (c) does not substantially inhibit binding of a human ICAM-1 to LFA-1 and/or MAC- l ; \n\n\n (d) can inhibit a cytopathic effect of human rhino virus on HeLa cells in culture with an EC50 of less than 0.35 nM; \n\n\n (e) does not immunospecifically bind to human ICAM-2; \n\n\n (f) does not immunospecifically bind to human ICAM-3; \n\n\n (g) does not immunospecifically bind to human ICAM-5; \n\n\n (h) does not immunospecifically bind to human VCAM-1 ; \n\n\n (i) immunospecifically binds to human ICAM-1 comprising a K56M polymorphism; and \n\n\n (j) binds to the same or substantially the same epitope as an antibody comprising a VH amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 292 and a VL amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 297. It should be understood that antibodies defined based on possessing any one or more of \n\n the foregoing properties possesses, at least, such one or more properties but may also possess other functional or structural characteristics. \n\n\n (c) Functional Characteristics \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies of the invention alter the biological properties of ICAM- 1 and/or ICAM-1 expressing cells and/or cells expressing receptors for IC AM- 1. In one embodiment, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies of the invention neutralize a biological activity of ICAM-1, such as HRV infectivity and/or CV-A infectivity and/or adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes to the endothelium. \n\n\nNeutralization assays are performed using methods known in the art using, in some circumstances, commercially available reagents or for example as performed in Assay 3,\n\n\nAssay 7 or Example 12 described below. The neutralization of ICAM-1 is measured with an IC50 of lxlO\n\"6\n M or less, lxlO\n\"7\n M or less, lxlO\n\"8\n M or less, lxlO\n\"9\n M or less, lxlO\n\"10\n M or less and lxlO\n\"11\n M or less. In certain embodiments, the neutralization of ICAM-1 is measured with an IC50 of between lxlO\n\"6\n M and lxlO\n\"9\n M, lxlO\n\"6\n M and lxlO\n\"10\n M, lxlO\n\"6\n M and lxlO\n\"11\n M, lxlO\n\"7\n M and lxlO\n\"9\n M, lxlO\n\"7\n M and lxlO\n\"10\n M, lxlO\n\"7\n M and lxlO\n\"11\n M, lxlO\n\"8\n M and lxlO\n\"9\n M, lxlO\n\"8\n M and lxlO\n\"10\n M and lxlO\n\"8\n M and lxlO\n\"11\n M. In a further embodiment, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies neutralize at least one of chimpanzee ICAM-1, baboon ICAM- 1, marmoset ICAM-1, cynomolgus ICAM-1, rhesus ICAM- 1, rat ICAM-1, mouse ICAM- 1, pig ICAM-1 or other mammalian ICAM-1. The term \"inhibitory concentration 50%\" (abbreviated as \"IC50\") represents the concentration of an inhibitor (e.g., an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody of the invention) that is required for 50% inhibition of a given activity of the molecule the inhibitor targets (e.g., ICAM-1). It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that a lower IC50 value corresponds to a more potent inhibitor. \n\n\n The term \"inhibition\" as used herein, refers to any statistically significant decrease in biological activity, including full blocking of the activity. For example, \"inhibition\" can refer to a decrease of about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% in biological activity. In one embodiment, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies are described as not inhibiting one or more biological activities of ICAM- 1, such as LFA- 1 binding and/or MAC- 1 binding. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies inhibit one or more biological activities of ICAM-1 by less than 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100%. In one embodiment, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies inhibit ICAM-1 binding to LFA by less than 20%, less than 30%, less than 40%, less than 50%, or less than 60%. \n\n In certain embodiments, the anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies may bind to a cell-surface antigen that may internalize, further carrying the antibodies into the cell. Once inside the cell, the antibodies may be released into the cytoplasm, targeted to a specific compartment, or recycled to the cell surface. In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention bind to a cell-surface antigen that internalizes. In other embodiments, antibodies of the invention may be targeted to specific organelles or compartments of the cell. In yet other embodiments, the antibodies of the invention may be recycled to the cell surface or periphery after \n\n\ninternalization. In a specific embodiment, the antibody of the invention is specific for ICAM- 1. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies of the invention exhibit a reduced antibody related toxicity as compared to an IC AM- 1 antibody that inhibits LFA- 1 binding. In another embodiment, the anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies of the invention exhibit toxicities that are at least 2 fold, or at least 3 fold, or at least 5 fold, or at least 7 fold, or a least 10 fold, or at least 20 fold, or at least 30 fold, or at least 40 fold, or at least 50 fold, or at least 60 fold, or at least 70 fold, or at least 80 fold, or at least 90 fold, or at least 100 fold, or at least 200 fold, or are between 2 fold and 10 fold, or between 5 fold and 50 fold, or between 25 fold and 100 fold, or between 75 fold and 200 fold, or between 100 and 200 fold, less than that of an antibody that inhibits LFA-1 binding. In another embodiment, the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies of the invention exhibit toxicities that are reduced by at least 10%, or at least 20%, or by at least 30%, or by at least 40%, or by at least 50%, or by at least 60%, or by at least 70%, or by at least 80%, or by at least 90%, or by at least 100%, or by at least 200%, or by at least 300%, or by at least 400%, or by at least 500% relative to an antibody that inhibits LFA-1 binding. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention block binding of ICAM-1 to HRV. In a specific embodiment, the antibodies of the invention block binding of ICAM-1 to HRV- 14 and HRV- 16. In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention block binding of ICAM-1 to CV-A. In a specific embodiment, the antibodies of the invention block binding of ICAM-1 to CV-A16 and/or CV-A16. In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention block binding of ICAM-1 to Plasmodium falciparum- f cted erythrocytes (PFIE). \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are human, humanized, chimeric or antibody fragments. \n\n\n (v) Production of Anti-ICAM-1 Antibodies \n\n\n The following describes exemplary techniques for the production of the antibodies useful in the present invention. Some of these techniques are described further in the \n\n Example section, See Example 11. The ICAM-1 antigen to be used for production of antibodies may be SEQ ID NO: 481 (human ICAM- 1) or an antigenic fragment thereof. In certain embodiments, the ICAM- 1 antigen to be used for production of antibodies may be SEQ ID NO: 482 or an antigenic fragment thereof. Alternatively, cells expressing ICAM- 1 at their cell surface or membranes prepared from such cells can be used to generate antibodies. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of ICAM-1 are available as provided above. \n\n\nICAM- 1 can be produced recombinantly in an isolated form from, bacterial or eukaryotic cells using standard recombinant DNA methodology. ICAM-1 can be expressed as a tagged (e.g., epitope tag) or other fusion protein to facilitate isolation as well as identification in various assays. Antibodies or binding proteins that bind to various tags and fusion sequences are available as elaborated below. Other forms of ICAM-1 useful for generating antibodies will be apparent to those skilled in the art. \n\n\n (a) Tags \n\n\n Various tag polypeptides and their respective antibodies are well known in the art. Examples include poly-histidine (poly-his) or poly-histidine-glycine (poly-his-gly) tags; the flu HA tag polypeptide and its antibody 12CA5 [Field et al., Mol. Cell. Biol, 8:2159-2165 (1988)] ; the c-myc tag and the 8F9, 3C7, 6E10, G4, B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto [Evan et al., Molecular and Cellular Biology, 5:3610-3616 (1985)]; and the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) tag and its antibody [Paborsky et al., Protein Engineering, 3(6):547-553 (1990)] . The FLAG-peptide [Hopp et al., BioTechnology, 6: 1204-1210 (1988)] is recognized by an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co., New Haven, Conn.). \n\n\nPurification of a protein containing the FLAG peptide can be performed by immunoaffinity chromatography using an affinity matrix comprising the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody covalently attached to agarose (Eastman Kodak Co., New Haven, Conn.). Other tag polypeptides include the KT3 epitope peptide [Martin et al., Science, 255: 192-194 (1992)] ; an a-tubulin epitope peptide [Skinner et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266: 15163- 15166 (1991)] ; and the T7 gene 10 protein peptide tag [Lutz-Freyermuth et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:6393-6397 (1990)]. \n\n\n (b) Monoclonal Antibodies \n\n\n Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma (Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975); Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); \n\n Hammerling, et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981), recombinant, and phage display technologies, or a combination thereof. The term \"monoclonal antibody\" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous or isolated antibodies, e.g., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site or multiple antigenic sites in the case of multispecific engineered antibodies. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against the same determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier \"monoclonal\" is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. Following is a description of representative methods for producing monoclonal antibodies which is not intended to be limiting and may be used to produce, for example, monoclonal mammalian, chimeric, humanized, human, domain, diabodies, vaccibodies, linear and multispecific antibodies. A. Hybridoma Techniques \n\n\n Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art. In the hybridoma method, mice or other appropriate host animals, such as hamster, are immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the antigen used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro, as is typically done when using hybridoma technology to produce human monoclonal antibodies.. After immunization (in vivo or in vitro), lymphocytes are isolated and then fused with a myeloma cell line using a suitable fusing agent or fusion partner, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59- 103 (Academic Press, 1986)). In certain embodiments, the selected myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody- producing cells, and are sensitive to a selective medium that selects against the unfused parental cells. In one aspect, the myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 and derivatives e.g., X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the \n\n production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, . Immunol, 133:3001 (1984); and Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications , pp.51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)). \n\n\n Once hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, Supra). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal e.g., by i.p. injection of the cells into mice. \n\n\n The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as, for example, affinity chromatography (e.g., using protein A or protein G-Sepharose) or ion-exchange chromatography, affinity tags, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, etc. Exemplary purification methods are described in more detail below. \n\n\nB. Recombinant DNA Techniques \n\n\n Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using recombinant DNA technology are routine and well known in the art (e.g. US Patent No. 4,816,567). DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies may be readily isolated and/or sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as E. coli cells, simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce antibody protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al., Curr. Opinion in Immunol, 5:256-262 (1993) and Pluckthun, Immunol. Revs., 130: 151-188 (1992). As described below for antibodies generated by phage display and humanization of antibodies, DNA or genetic material for recombinant antibodies can be obtained from source(s) other than hybridomas to generate antibodies of the invention. \n\n\n Recombinant expression of an antibody or variant thereof generally requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. The invention, thus, provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule, a heavy or light chain of an antibody, a heavy or light chain variable domain of an antibody or a portion thereof, or a heavy or light chain CDR, operably linked to \n\n a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule (see, e.g. , US. Patent Nos. 5,981,216; 5,591,639; 5,658,759 and 5,122,464) and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy, the entire light chain, or both the entire heavy and light chains. \n\n\n Once the expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques, the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody. Thus, the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention or fragments thereof, or a heavy or light chain thereof, or portion thereof, or a single-chain antibody of the invention, operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In certain embodiments for the expression of double-chained antibodies, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule, as detailed below. \n\n\n Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression of recombinant antibodies are well known in the art and include many immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), including but not limited to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), human epithelial kidney 293 cells, and a number of other cell lines. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. \n\n\nAppropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the antibody or portion thereof expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERY, BHK, Hela, COS, MDCK, 293, 3T3, W138, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, NSO (a murine myeloma cell line that does not endogenously produce any functional immunoglobulin chains), SP20, CRL7030 and HsS78Bst cells. In one embodiment, human cell lines developed by immortalizing human lymphocytes can be used to recombinantly produce monoclonal antibodies. In one embodiment, the human cell line PER.C6. (Crucell, Netherlands) can be used to \n\n\nrecombinantly produce monoclonal antibodies. \n\n\n Additional cell lines which may be used as hosts for expression of recombinant antibodies include, but are not limited to, insect cells (e.g. Sf21/Sf9, Trichoplusia ni Bti- Tn5bl-4) or yeast cells (e.g. 5. cerevisiae, Pichia, US7326681 ; etc), plants cells \n\n\n(US20080066200); and chicken cells (WO2008142124). \n\n In certain embodiments, antibodies of the invention are expressed in a cell line with stable expression of the antibody. Stable expression can be used for long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins. For example, cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be generated. Host cells can be transformed with an appropriately engineered vector comprising expression control elements (e.g. , promoter, enhancer, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker gene. \n\n\nFollowing the introduction of the foreign DNA, cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells that stably integrated the plasmid into their chromosomes to grow and form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. Methods for producing stable cell lines with a high yield are well known in the art and reagents are generally available commercially. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, antibodies of the invention are expressed in a cell line with transient expression of the antibody. Transient transfection is a process in which the nucleic acid introduced into a cell does not integrate into the genome or chromosomal DNA of that cell. It is in fact maintained as an extrachromosomal element, e.g. as an episome, in the cell. Transcription processes of the nucleic acid of the episome are not affected and a protein encoded by the nucleic acid of the episome is produced. \n\n\n The cell line, either stable or transiently transfected, is maintained in cell culture medium and conditions well known in the art resulting in the expression and production of monoclonal antibodies. In certain embodiments, the mammalian cell culture media is based on commercially available media formulations, including, for example, DMEM or Ham's F12. In other embodiments, the cell culture media is modified to support increases in both cell growth and biologic protein expression. As used herein, the terms \"cell culture medium,\" \"culture medium,\" and \"medium formulation\" refer to a nutritive solution for the maintenance, growth, propagation, or expansion of cells in an artificial in vitro environment outside of a multicellular organism or tissue. Cell culture medium may be optimized for a specific cell culture use, including, for example, cell culture growth medium which is formulated to promote cellular growth, or cell culture production medium which is formulated to promote recombinant protein production. The terms nutrient, ingredient, and component are used interchangeably herein to refer to the constituents that make up a cell culture medium. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the cell lines are maintained using a fed batch method. As used herein, \"fed batch method,\" refers to a method by which a fed batch cell culture is supplied \n\n with additional nutrients after first being incubated with a basal medium. For example, a fed batch method may comprise adding supplemental media according to a determined feeding schedule within a given time period. Thus, a \"fed batch cell culture\" refers to a cell culture wherein the cells, typically mammalian, and culture medium are supplied to the culturing vessel initially and additional culture nutrients are fed, continuously or in discrete increments, to the culture during culturing, with or without periodic cell and/or product harvest before termination of culture. \n\n\n The cell culture medium used and the nutrients contained therein are known to one of skill in the art. In one embodiment, the cell culture medium comprises a basal medium and at least one hydrolysate, e.g., soy-based, hydrolysate, a yeast-based hydrolysate, or a combination of the two types of hydrolysates resulting in a modified basal medium. In another embodiment, the additional nutrients may include only a basal medium, such as a concentrated basal medium, or may include only hydrolysates, or concentrated hydrolysates. Suitable basal media include, but are not limited to Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), DME/F12, Minimal Essential Medium (MEM), Basal Medium Eagle (BME), RPMI 1640, F-10, F-12, a-Minimal Essential Medium (a-MEM), Glasgow's Minimal Essential Medium (G-MEM), PF CHO (see, e.g., CHO protein free medium (Sigma) or EX- CELL™ 325 PF CHO Serum-Free Medium for CHO Cells Protein-Free (SAFC Bioscience), and Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium. Other examples of basal media which may be used in the invention include BME Basal Medium (Gibco-Invitrogen; see also Eagle, H (1965) Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 89, 36); Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, powder) (Gibco-Invitrogen (# 31600); see also Dulbecco and Freeman (1959) Virology 8, 396; Smith et al. (1960) Virology 12, 185. Tissue Culture Standards Committee, In Vitro 6:2, 93); CMRL 1066 Medium (Gibco-Invitrogen (#11530); see also Parker R. C. et al (1957) Special Publications, N.Y. Academy of Sciences, 5, 303). \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the basal medium may be is serum-free, meaning that the medium contains no serum (e.g., fetal bovine serum (FBS), horse serum, goat serum, or any other animal-derived serum known to one skilled in the art) or animal protein free media or chemically defined media. \n\n\n The basal medium may be modified in order to remove certain non-nutritional components found in standard basal medium, such as various inorganic and organic buffers, surfactant(s), and sodium chloride. Removing such components from basal cell medium allows an increased concentration of the remaining nutritional components, and may improve overall cell growth and protein expression. In addition, omitted components may be added \n\n back into the cell culture medium containing the modified basal cell medium according to the requirements of the cell culture conditions. In certain embodiments, the cell culture medium contains a modified basal cell medium, and at least one of the following nutrients, an iron source, a recombinant growth factor; a buffer; a surfactant; an osmolarity regulator; an energy source; and non-animal hydrolysates. In addition, the modified basal cell medium may optionally contain amino acids, vitamins, or a combination of both amino acids and vitamins. In another embodiment, the modified basal medium further contains glutamine, e.g., L- glutamine, and/or methotrexate. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a bioreactor process using fed-batch, batch, perfusion or continuous feed bioreactor methods known in the art. Large-scale bioreactors have at least 1000 liters of capacity, preferably about 1,000 to 100,000 liters of capacity. These bioreactors may use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients. Small scale bioreactors refers generally to cell culturing in no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity, and can range from about 1 liter to about 100 liters. Alternatively, single-use bioreactors (SUB) may be used for either large-scale or small scale culturing. \n\n\n Temperature, pH, agitation, aeration and inoculum density will vary depending upon the host cells used and the recombinant protein to be expressed. For example, a recombinant protein cell culture may be maintained at a temperature between 30 and 45 degrees Celsius. The pH of the culture medium may be monitored during the culture process such that the pH stays at an optimum level, which may be for certain host cells, within a pH range of 6.0 to 8.0. An impellor driven mixing may be used for such culture methods for agitation. The rotational speed of the impellor may be approximately 50 to 200 cm/sec tip speed, but other airlift or other mixing/aeration systems known in the art may be used, depending on the type of host cell being cultured. Sufficient aeration is provided to maintain a dissolved oxygen concentration of approximately 20% to 80% air saturation in the culture, again, depending upon the selected host cell being cultured. Alternatively, a bioreactor may sparge air or oxygen directly into the culture medium. Other methods of oxygen supply exist, including bubble-free aeration systems employing hollow fiber membrane aerators. \n\n\nC. Phage Display Techniques \n\n\n In another embodiment, monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al., Nature, 348:552-554 (1990). Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 (1991). In such methods antibodies of the invention can be isolated \n\n by screening of a recombinant combinatorial antibody library, preferably a scFv phage display library, prepared using human VL and VH cDNAs prepared from mRNA derived from human lymphocytes. Methodologies for preparing and screening such libraries are known in the art. In addition to commercially available kits for generating phage display libraries (e.g., the Pharmacia Recombinant Phage Antibody System, catalog no. 27-9400-01; and the Stratagene SURFZAP™ phage display kit, catalog no. 240612), examples of methods and reagents particularly amenable for use in generating and screening antibody display libraries can be found in, for example, US Patent Nos. 6,248,516; US 6,545,142; 6,291, 158; 6,291, 1591; 6,291,160; 6,291,161 ; 6,680,192; 5,969,108; 6,172, 197; 6,806,079; 5,885,793; 6,521,404; 6,544,731 ; 6,555,313; 6,593,081; 6,582,915; 7, 195,866. Thus, these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for generation and isolation of monoclonal antibodies. \n\n\n In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In a particular embodiment, such phage can be utilized to display antigen-binding domains expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library (e.g., human or murine). Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 binding domains expressed from phage with Fab, Fv or disulfide stabilized Fv antibody domains recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII protein. \n\n\n As described in the above references, after phage selection, the antibody coding regions from the phage can be isolated and used to generate whole antibodies, including human antibodies, humanized antibodies, or any other desired antigen binding fragment, and expressed in any desired host, including mammalian cells, insect cells, plant cells, yeast, and bacteria, e.g., as described in detail below. For example, techniques to recombinantly produce Fab, Fab' and F(ab')2 fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT publication WO 92/22324; Mullinax et ah, BioTechniques 12(6):864-869 (1992);; and Better et al, Science 240: 1041-1043 (1988). \n\n\n Examples of techniques which can be used to produce single-chain Fvs and antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,258,498. Thus, techniques described above and those well known in the art can be used to generate recombinant antibodies wherein the binding domain, e.g. ScFv, was isolated from a phage display library. \n\n (c) Antibody Purification and Isolation \n\n\n Once an antibody molecule has been produced by recombinant or hybridoma expression, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigens Protein A or Protein G, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Further, the antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof may be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences (referred to herein as \"tags\") described above or otherwise known in the art to facilitate purification. \n\n\n When using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, is removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et ah, Bio/Technology, 10: 163-167 (1992) describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted into the periplasmic space of E. coli. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious \n\n\ncontaminants. \n\n\n The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and/or affinity chromatography either alone or in combination with other purification steps. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody and will be understood by one of skill in the art. The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CH\n3\n domain, the Bakerbond ABX resin (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion- exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin, SEPHAROSE chromatography on an anion or cation exchange \n\n resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered. \n\n\n Following any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction \n\n\nchromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, and performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25 M salt). \n\n\n Thus, in certain embodiments is provided antibodies of the invention that are substantially purified/isolated. In one embodiment, these isolated/purified recombinantly expressed antibodies may be administered to a patient to mediate a prophylactic or therapeutic effect. In another embodiment these isolated/purified antibodies may be used to diagnose a ICAM-1 mediated disease. \n\n\n (d) Humanized and Chimeric Antibodies \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are humanized antibodies, which are generated using methods well known in the art. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules derived from a non-human species antibody (also referred to herein as a donor antibody) that bind the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule (also referred to herein as an acceptor antibody). Often, framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the \n\n\ncorresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding and/or reduce immunogenicity. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g.,, Riechmann et ah, Nature 332:323 (1988)). In practice, and in certain embodiments, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies. In alternative embodiments, the FR residues are fully human residues. \n\n\n Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co- workers (Jones et al., Nature, 321 :522-525 (1986); Reichmann et al., Supra; Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239: 1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Specifically, humanized antibodies may be prepared by methods well known in the art including CDR grafting approaches (see, e.g., US \n\n Patent No. 6,548,640), veneering or resurfacing (US Patent Nos. 5,639,641 and 6,797,492; Studnicka et al, Protein Engineering 7(6):805-814 (1994); Roguska. et al, PNAS 91:969- 973 (1994)), chain shuffling strategies (see e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,565,332; Rader et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1998) 95:8910-8915), molecular modeling strategies (U.S. Patent No. 5,639,641), and the like. These general approaches may be combined with standard mutagenesis and recombinant synthesis techniques to produce anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies with desired properties. \n\n\n CDR grafting is performed by replacing one or more CDRs of an acceptor antibody (e.g., a human antibody) with one or more CDRs of a donor antibody (e.g., a non-human antibody). Acceptor antibodies may be selected based on similarity of framework residues between a candidate acceptor antibody and a donor antibody and may be further modified to introduce similar residues. Following CDR grafting, additional changes may be made in the donor and/or acceptor sequences to optimize antibody binding and functionality. \n\n\n Grafting of abbreviated CDR regions is a related approach. Abbreviated CDR regions include the specificity-determining residues and adjacent amino acids, including those at positions 27d-34, 50-55 and 89-96 in the light chain, and at positions 31-35b, 50-58, and 95- 101 in the heavy chain. See (Padlan et al. (1995) FASEB J. 9: 133-9). Grafting of specificity- determining residues (SDRs) is premised on the understanding that the binding specificity and affinity of an antibody combining site is determined by the most highly variable residues within each of the CDR regions. Analysis of the three-dimensional structures of antibody- antigen complexes, combined with analysis of the available amino acid sequence data was used to model sequence variability based on structural dissimilarity of amino acid residues that occur at each position within the CDR. Minimally immunogenic polypeptide sequences consisting of contact residues, which are referred to as SDRs, are identified and grafted onto human framework regions. \n\n\n Veneering or resurfacing is based on the concept of reducing potentially \n\n\nimmunogenic amino acid sequences in a rodent or other non-human antibody by resurfacing the solvent accessible exterior of the antibody with human amino acid sequences. Thus, veneered antibodies appear less foreign to human cells. A non-human antibody is veneered by (1) identifying exposed exterior framework region residues in the non-human antibody, which are different from those at the same positions in framework regions of a human antibody, and (2) replacing the identified residues with amino acids that typically occupy these same positions in human antibodies. \n\n By definition, humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies. Chimeric antibodies are antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while another portion of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (e.g., Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81 :6851-6855 (1984)). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include \"primatized\" antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a nonhuman primate (e.g. , Old World Monkey, such as baboon, rhesus or cynomolgus monkey) and human constant region sequences (U.S. Patent No. 5,693,780). \n\n\n (e) Human Antibodies \n\n\n As an alternative to humanization, human antibodies can be generated using methods well known in the art. Human antibodies avoid some of the problems associated with antibodies that possess murine or rat variable and/or constant regions. The presence of such murine or rat derived proteins can lead to the rapid clearance of the antibodies or can lead to the generation of an immune response against the antibody by a patient. In order to avoid the utilization of murine or rat derived antibodies, fully human antibodies can be generated through the introduction of functional human antibody loci into a rodent, other mammal or animal so that the rodent, other mammal or animal produces fully human antibodies. \n\n\n For example, it is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (½) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array into such germ- line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., Nature, 362:255-258 (1993); Bruggemann et al., Year in Immuno., 7:33 (1993); U.S. Pat. Nos. \n\n\n5,545,806, 5,569,825, 5,591,669 (all of GenPharm); U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,807; and WO\n\n\n97/17852. In practice, the use of XENOMOUSE® strains of mice that have been engineered to contain up to but less than 1000 kb-sized germline configured fragments of the human heavy chain locus and kappa light chain locus. See Mendez et al. Nature Genetics 15: 146-156 \n\n (1997) and Green and Jakobovits J. Exp. Med. 188:483-495 (1998). The XENOMOUSE® strains are available from Amgen, Inc. (Fremont, Calif.). \n\n\n The production of the XENOMOUSE® strains of mice and antibodies produced in those mice is further discussed and delineated in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,673,986; 7,049,426; 6,833,268; 6, 162,963, 6, 150,584, 6,114,598, 6,075,181, 6,657,103; 6,713,610 and 5,939,598;\n\n\nUS Publication Nos. 2004/0010810; 2003/0229905; 2004/0093622; 2005/0054055; \n\n\n 2005/0076395; and 2006/0040363. \n\n\n Essentially, XENOMOUSE® lines of mice are immunized with an antigen of interest\n\n\n(e.g. ICAM- 1), lymphatic cells (such as B-cells) are recovered from the hyper-immunized mice, and the recovered lymphocytes are fused with a myeloid-type cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines using techniques described above an well known in the art.\n\n\nThese hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produced antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. \n\n\n In an alternative approach, others, including GenPharm International, Inc., have utilized a \"minilocus\" approach. In the minilocus approach, an exogenous Ig locus is mimicked through the inclusion of pieces (individual genes) from the Ig locus. Thus, one or more V\nH\n genes, one or more D\nH\n genes, one or more J\nH\n genes, a mu constant region, and usually a second constant region (preferably a gamma constant region) are formed into a construct for insertion into an animal. This approach is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,625,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,016; 5,770,429; 5,789,650; 5,814,318;\n\n\n5,877,397; 5,874,299; 6,255,458; 5,591,669; 6,023,010; 5,612,205; 5,721,367; 5,789,215;\n\n\n5,643,763; and 5,981,175. \n\n\n Kirin has also demonstrated the generation of human antibodies from mice in which, through microcell fusion, large pieces of chromosomes, or entire chromosomes, have been introduced. See Patent No. 6,632,976. Additionally, KM™— mice, which are the result of cross-breeding of Kirin's Tc mice with Medarex's minilocus (Humab) mice have been generated. These mice possess the human IgH transchromosome of the Kirin mice and the kappa chain transgene of the Genpharm mice (Ishida et al., Cloning Stem Cells, (2002) 4:91-\n\n\n102). \n\n\n Human antibodies can also be derived by in vitro methods, including but not limited to those exemplified in Examples 1-6 and 11. Suitable examples include but are not limited to phage display (Medlmmune (formerly CAT), Morphosys, Dyax, Biosite/Medarex, Xoma, Symphogen, Alexion (formerly Proliferon), Affimed) ribosome display (Medlmmune (formerly CAT)), yeast display, and the like. The phage display technology (See e.g., US \n\n Patent No. 5,969,108) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as Ml 3 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the \n\n\nfilamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B-cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats, reviewed in, e.g., Johnson, Kevin S. and Chiswell, David J., Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3:564- 571 (1993). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al., /. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597 (1991), or Griffith et al., EMBO J. 12:725-734 (1993). See, also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,565,332 and 5,573,905. \n\n\n As discussed above, human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,567,610 and 5,229,275). \n\n\n Immunoglobulin genes undergo various modifications during maturation of the immune response, including recombination between V, D and J gene segments, isotype switching, and hypermutation in the variable regions. Recombination and somatic hypermutation are the foundation for generation of antibody diversity and affinity maturation, but they can also generate sequence liabilities that may make commercial production of such immunoglobulins as therapeutic agents difficult or increase the immunogenicity risk of the antibody. In general, mutations in CDR regions are likely to contribute to improved affinity and function, while mutations in framework regions may increase the risk of \n\n\nimmunogenicity. This risk can be reduced by reverting framework mutations to germline while ensuring that activity of the antibody is not adversely impacted. The diversification processes may also generate some structural liabilities or these structural liabilities may exist within germline sequences contributing to the heavy and light chain variable domains. \n\n\nRegardless of the source, it may be desirable to remove potential structural liabilities that may result in instability, aggregation, heterogeneity of product, or increased immunogenicity. Examples of undesirable liabilities include unpaired cysteines (which may lead to disulfide \n\n bond scrambling, or variable sulfhydryl adduct formation), N-linked glycosylation sites (resulting in heterogeneity of structure and activity), as well as deamidation (e.g. NG, NS), isomerization (DG), oxidation (exposed methionine), and hydrolysis (DP) sites. \n\n\n Accordingly, in order to reduce the risk of immunogenicity and improve \n\n\npharmaceutical properties of the antibodies of the invention (see Example 4), it may be desirable to revert a framework sequence to germline, revert a CDR to germline, and/or remove a structural liability. \n\n\n (f) Antibody Fragments \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the present antibodies are antibody fragments or antibodies comprising these fragments. The antibody fragment comprises a portion of the full length antibody, which generally is the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n, Fd and Fv fragments. Diabodies; linear antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870); single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies are antibodies formed from these antibody fragments. \n\n\n Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies using techniques well known in the art. However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab, Fv and scFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from E. coli, thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. In one embodiment, the antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab'-SH fragments can also be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form F(ab')\n2\n fragments (Carter et ah , Bio/Technology, 10: 163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab')\n2\n fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single-chain Fv fragment (scFv). In certain embodiments, the antibody is not a Fab fragment. Fv and scFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions; thus, they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. scFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an scFv. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the present antibodies are domain antibodies, e.g. , antibodies containing the small functional binding units of antibodies, corresponding to the variable regions of the heavy (VH) or light (VL) chains of human antibodies. Examples of domain antibodies include, but are not limited to, those available from Domantis that are specific to \n\n therapeutic targets (see, for example, WO04/058821; WO04/081026; WO04/003019; \n\n\n WO03/002609; U.S. Patent Nos. 6,291,158; 6,582,915; 6,696,245; and 6,593,081). \n\n\n Commercially available libraries of domain antibodies can be used to identify anti-IC AM- 1 domain antibodies. In certain embodiments, anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies comprise a ICAM-1 functional binding unit and an Fc gamma receptor functional binding unit. \n\n\n In certain embodiments of the invention, the present antibodies are vaccibodies.\n\n\nVaccibodies are dimeric polypeptides. Each monomer of a vaccibody consists of a scFv with specificity for a surface molecule on APC connected through a hinge region and a C 3 domain to a second scFv. In other embodiments of the invention, vaccibodies containing as one of the scFv's an anti-ICAM-1 antibody fragment may be used to juxtapose those cells to be destroyed and an effector cell that mediates ADCC. For example, see, Bogen et al, U.S.\n\n\nPatent Application Publication No. 2004/0253238. \n\n\n In certain embodiments of the invention, the present antibodies are linear antibodies.\n\n\nLinear antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (V\nH\n-C\nHI\n-V\nH\n-C\nHI\n) which form a pair of antigen-binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific. See, Zapata et al, Protein Eng., 8(10): 1057-1062 (1995). \n\n\n (g) Bispecific Antibodies \n\n\n Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of the ICAM-1 protein. Other such antibodies may combine a ICAM-1 binding site with a binding site for another protein. Alternatively, an anti-ICAM-1 arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor molecule (e.g. CD3), or Fc receptors for IgG (FcyR), such as FcyRI (CD64), FcyRII (CD32) and FcyRIII (CD16), so as to focus and localize cellular defense mechanisms to the ICAM-l-expressing cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express ICAM-1. These antibodies possess a ICAM-1 -binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent (e.g. saporin, anti-interferon-a, vinca alkaloid, ricin A chain, methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten). Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab')\n2\n bispecific antibodies). Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. {See, for example, Millstein et al, Nature, 305:537-539 (1983); Traunecker et al, EMBO J., 10:3655-3659 (1991); Suresh et al, Methods in \n\n\nEnzymology, 121:210 (1986); Kostelny et al, J. Immunol, 148(5):1547-1553 (1992); \n\n\nHollinger et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Set USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993); Gruber et al, J. Immunol, \n\n 152:5368 (1994); U.S. Patent Nos. 4,474,893; 4,714,681 ; 4,925,648; 5,573,920; 5,601,819; 5,731, 168; 4,676,980; 5,897,861 ; 5,660,827; 5,811,267; 5,849,877; 5,948,647; 5,959,084; 6,106,833; 6, 143,873 and 4,676,980, WO 94/04690; and WO 92/20373.) \n\n\n Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the co- expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (Millstein et al., Nature, 305:537-539 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829, and in Traunecker et al., EMBO J., 10:3655-3659 (1991). \n\n\n According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. Preferably, the fusion is with an Ig heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH , and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CHI) containing the site necessary for light chain bonding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host cell. This provides for greater flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yield of the desired bispecific antibody. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains into a single expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios have no significant affect on the yield of the desired chain combination. \n\n\n In one embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. This asymmetric structure may facilitate the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., Methods in Enzymology, 121 :210 (1986). \n\n According to another approach described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,168, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the CH3 domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory \"cavities\" of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end- products such as homodimers. \n\n\n Bispecific antibodies include cross-linked or \"heteroconjugate\" antibodies. For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (US Patent No. 5,897,861). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques. \n\n\n Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., Science, 229: 81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytic ally cleaved to generate F(ab')\n2\n fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent, sodium arsenite, to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab' fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab'-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab '-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab'-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes. \n\n\n Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab'-SH fragments from E. coli, which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., . Exp. Med., 175: 217-225 (1992) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab')\n2\n molecule. Each Fab' fragment was separately secreted from E. coli and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T \n\n cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets. \n\n\n Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., . Immunol, 148(5): 1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab' portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody \n\n\nheterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The \"diabody\" technology described by Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 90:6444- 6448 ( 1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a V\nH\n connected to a V\nL\nby a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the V\nH\n nd V\nL\n domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary V\nL\n and V\nH\n domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al., /. Immunol, 152:5368 (1994) and US Patent Nos. 5,591,828; 4,946,778; 5,455,030; and 5,869,620. \n\n\n Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared, Tutt et al. /. Immunol. 147: 60 (1991), and multispecific valencies US Patent No. 5,258,498. \n\n\n (h) Other Amino Acid Sequence Modifications \n\n\n In addition to the above described human, humanized and/or chimeric antibodies, the present invention also encompasses further modifications and, their variants and fragments thereof, of the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies of the invention comprising one or more amino acid residues and/or polypeptide substitutions, additions and/or deletions in the variable light (V\nL\n) domain and/or variable heavy (V\nH\n) domain and/or Fc region and post translational modifications. Included in these modifications are antibody conjugates wherein an antibody has been covalently attached to a moiety. Moieties suitable for attachment to the antibodies include but are not limited to, proteins, peptides, drugs, labels, and cytotoxins. These changes to the antibodies may be made to alter or fine tune the characteristics biochemical, binding and/or functional) of the antibodies as is appropriate for treatment and/or diagnosis of ICAM-1 mediated diseases. Methods for forming conjugates, making amino acid and/or \n\n polypeptide changes and post-translational modifications are well known in the art, some of which are detailed below. The following description is not intended to be limiting, but instead a non-limiting description of some embodiments, more of which will be obvious to one of skill in the art. It is also understood that some of the following methods were used to develop the human, humanized and/or chimeric antibody sequences described above. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. \n\n\n Amino acid changes to the antibodies necessarily results in sequences that are less than 100% identical to the above identified antibody sequences or parent antibody sequence. In certain embodiments, in this context, the antibodies many have about 75% to about 95% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of either the heavy or light chain variable domain of an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody as described herein. Thus, in one embodiment a modified antibody may have an amino acid sequence having at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of either the heavy or light chain variable domain of an anti-ICAM-1 antibody as described herein. In another embodiment, an altered antibody may have an amino acid sequence having at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of the heavy or light chain CDR1, CDR2, or CDR3 of an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody as described herein. In another embodiment, an altered antibody may have an amino acid sequence having at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of the heavy or light chain FRl, FR2, FR3 or FR4 of an anti-ICAM-1 antibody as described herein. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, altered antibodies are generated by one or more amino acid alterations (e.g. , substitutions, deletion and/or additions) introduced in one or more of the variable regions of the antibody. In another embodiment, the amino acid alterations are introduced in the framework regions. One or more alterations of framework region residues may result in an improvement in the binding affinity of the antibody for the antigen. This may be especially true when these changes are made to humanized antibodies wherein the framework region may be from a different species than the CDR regions. Examples of framework region residues to modify include those which non-covalently bind antigen directly (Amit et al., Science, 233:747-753 (1986)); interact with/effect the conformation of a CDR (Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-917 (1987)); and/or participate in the V\nL\n-V\nH\n interface (US Patent Nos. 5,225,539 and 6,548,640). In one embodiment, from about one to about five framework residues may be altered. Sometimes, this may be sufficient to yield an \n\n antibody mutant suitable for use in preclinical trials, even where none of the hypervariable region residues have been altered. Normally, however, an altered antibody will comprise additional hypervariable region alteration(s). In certain embodiments, the hypervariable region residues may be changed randomly, especially where the starting binding affinity of an anti-ICAM-1 antibody for the antigen from the second mammalian species is such that such randomly produced antibodies can be readily screened. \n\n\n One useful procedure for generating altered antibodies is called \"alanine scanning mutagenesis\" (Cunningham and Wells, Science, 244:1081-1085 (1989)). In this method, one or more of the hypervariable region residue(s) are replaced by alanine or polyalanine residue(s) to alter the interaction of the amino acids with the ICAM-1. Those hypervariable region residue(s) demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing additional or other mutations at or for the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. The Ala-mutants produced this way are screened for their biological activity as described herein. \n\n\n In certain embodiments the substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display (Hawkins et al, J. Mol. Biol, 254:889-896 (1992) and Lowman et al, Biochemistry, 30(45): 10832-10837 (1991)). Briefly, several hypervariable region sites {e.g., 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibody mutants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of Ml 3 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed mutants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g., binding affinity) as herein disclosed. \n\n\n Mutations in antibody sequences may include substitutions, deletions, including internal deletions, additions, including additions yielding fusion proteins, or conservative substitutions of amino acid residues within and/or adjacent to the amino acid sequence, but that result in a \"silent\" change, in that the change produces a functionally equivalent anti- ICAM- 1 antibody. Conservative amino acid substitutions may be made on the basis of similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and/or the amphipathic nature of the residues involved. For example, non-polar (hydrophobic) amino \n\n acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine; polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine; positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine, and histidine; and negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. In addition, glycine and proline are residues that can influence chain orientation. Non- conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for a member of another class. Furthermore, if desired, non-classical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the antibody sequence. Non-classical amino acids include, but are not limited to, the D-isomers of the common amino acids, a -amino isobutyric acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, Abu, 2-amino butyric acid, γ- Abu, ε-Ahx, 6-amino hexanoic acid, Aib, 2-amino isobutyric acid, 3-amino propionic acid, ornithine, norleucine, norvaline, hydroxyproline, sarcosine, citrulline, cysteic acid, t- butylglycine, t-butylalanine, phenylglycine, cyclohexylalanine, β-alanine, fluoro-amino acids, designer amino acids such as β-methyl amino acids, Ca-methyl amino acids, Na-methyl amino acids, and amino acid analogs in general. \n\n\n In another embodiment, any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the anti-IC AM- 1 antibody also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. \n\n\nConversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability \n\n\n(particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment). \n\n\n In certain embodiments of the invention, an antibody can be modified to produce fusion proteins; i.e. , the antibody, or a fragment thereof, fused to a heterologous protein, polypeptide or peptide. In certain embodiments, the protein fused to the portion of an antibody is an enzyme component of Antibody-Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (ADEPT). Examples of other proteins or polypeptides that can be engineered as a fusion protein with an antibody include, but are not limited to toxins such as ricin, abrin, ribonuclease, DNase I, Staphylococcal enterotoxin-A, pokeweed anti- viral protein, gelonin, diphtherin toxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin, and Pseudomonas endotoxin. See, for example, Pastan et ah, Cell, 47:641 (1986), and Goldenberg et al., Cancer Journal for Clinicians, 44:43 (1994). \n\n\nEnzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain, non-binding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from \n\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, Aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, Phytolaca americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, \n\n gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin and the tricothecenes. See, for example, WO 93/21232. \n\n\n Additional fusion proteins may be generated through the techniques of gene-shuffling, motif- shuffling, exon- shuffling, and/or codon- shuffling (collectively referred to as \"DNA shuffling\"). DNA shuffling may be employed to alter the characteristics of the antibody or fragments thereof (e.g., an antibody or a fragment thereof with higher affinities and lower dissociation rates). See, generally, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,605,793; 5,811,238; 5,830,721; \n\n\n5,834,252; and 5,837,458, and Patten et al, 1997, Curr. Opinion Biotechnol, 8:724-33 ; Harayama, 1998, Trends Biotechnol. 16(2):76-82; Hansson et al, 1999, . Mol. Biol, 287:265-76; and Lorenzo and Blasco, 1998, Biotechniques 24(2):308- 313. The antibody can further be a binding-domain immunoglobulin fusion protein as described in U.S. Publication 2003/0118592, and PCT Publication WO 02/056910. \n\n\n (A) Variant Fc Regions \n\n\n It is known that variants of the Fc region (e.g., amino acid substitutions and/or additions and/or deletions) enhance or diminish effector function of the antibody (See e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,624,821; 5,885,573; 6,538,124; 7,317,091; 5,648,260; 6,538,124; WO 03/074679; WO 04/029207; WO 04/099249; WO 99/58572; US Publication No. \n\n\n2006/0134105; 2004/0132101; 2006/0008883) and may alter the pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. half-life) of the antibody (see, U.S. patents 6,277,375 and 7,083,784). Thus, in certain embodiments, the anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies of the invention comprise an altered Fc region (also referred to herein as \"variant Fc region\") in which one or more alterations have been made in the Fc region in order to change functional and/or pharmacokinetic properties of the antibodies. Such alterations may result in a decrease or increase of Clq binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) or of FcyR binding, for IgG, and antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), or antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP). The present invention encompasses the antibodies described herein with variant Fc regions wherein changes have been made to fine tune the effector function, enhancing or diminishing, providing a desired effector function. Accordingly, in one embodiment of the invention, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies of the invention comprise a variant Fc region (i.e., Fc regions that have been altered as discussed below). Anti-ICAM-1 antibodies of the invention comprising a variant Fc region are also referred to here as \"Fc variant antibodies.\" As used herein native refers to the unmodified parental sequence and the antibody comprising a native Fc region is herein referred to as a \"native Fc antibody\". Fc variant antibodies can be \n\n generated by numerous methods well known to one skilled in the art. Non-limiting examples include, isolating antibody coding regions (e.g., from hybridoma) and making one or more desired substitutions in the Fc region of the isolated antibody coding region. Alternatively, the antigen-binding portion (e.g., variable regions) of an anti-ICAM-1 antibody may be subcloned into a vector encoding a variant Fc region. In one embodiment, the variant Fc region exhibits a similar level of inducing effector function as compared to the native Fc region. In another embodiment, the variant Fc region exhibits a higher induction of effector function as compared to the native Fc. In another embodiment, the variant Fc region exhibits lower induction of effector function as compared to the native Fc. Some specific \n\n\nembodiments of variant Fc regions are detailed infra. Methods for measuring effector function are well known in the art. \n\n\n The effector function of an antibody is modified through changes in the Fc region, including but not limited to, amino acid substitutions, amino acid additions, amino acid deletions and changes in post translational modifications to Fc amino acids (e.g. \n\n\nglycosylation). The methods described below may be used to fine tune the effector function of a present antibody, a ratio of the binding properties of the Fc region for the FcR (e.g., affinity and specificity), resulting in a therapeutic antibody with the desired properties for a particular disease indication and taking into consideration the biology of IC AM- 1. \n\n\n It is understood that the Fc region as used herein includes the polypeptides comprising the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA, IgD, and IgG, and the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM, and the flexible hinge N-terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM Fc may include the J chain. For IgG, Fc comprises immunoglobulin domains Cgamma2 and Cgamma3 (Cj2 and Cj3) and the hinge between Cgammal (Cyl) and Cgamma2 (Cy2). Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to comprise residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl-terminus, wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as set forth in Kabat. Fc may refer to this region in isolation, or this region in the context of an antibody, antibody fragment, or Fc fusion protein. Polymorphisms have been observed at a number of different Fc positions, including but not limited to positions 270, 272, 312, 315, 356, and 358 as numbered by the EU index, and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the prior art may exist. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the present invention encompasses Fc variant antibodies which have altered binding properties for an Fc ligand (e.g., an Fc receptor, Clq) relative to a native \n\n Fc antibody. Examples of binding properties include but are not limited to, binding specificity, equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n), dissociation and association rates (k\n0\n f and kon respectively), binding affinity and/or avidity. It is known in the art that the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) is defined as kofflk\non\n. In certain aspects, an antibody comprising an Fc variant region with a low K\nD\n may be more desirable to an antibody with a high K\nD\n. \n\n\n However, in some instances the value of the k\non\n or k\n0\nff may be more relevant than the value of the KD. One skilled in the art can determine which kinetic parameter is most important for a given antibody application. For example, a modification that reduces binding to one or more positive regulator {e.g. , FcyRIIIA) and/or enhanced binding to an inhibitory Fc receptor {e.g. , FcyRIIB) would be suitable for reducing ADCC activity. Accordingly, the ratio of binding affinities {e.g. , the ratio of equilibrium dissociation constants (K\nd\n)) for different receptors can indicate if the ADCC activity of an Fc variant antibody of the invention is enhanced or decreased. Additionally, a modification that reduces binding to C lq would be suitable for reducing or eliminating CDC activity. \n\n\n In one embodiment, Fc variant antibodies exhibit altered binding affinity for one or more Fc receptors including, but not limited to FcRn, FcyRI (CD64) including isoforms FcyRIA, FcyRIB, and FcyRIC; FcyRII (CD32 including isoforms FcyRIIA, FcyRIIB, and FcyRIIC); and FcyRIII (CD16, including isoforms FcyRIIIA and FcyRIIIB) as compared to an native Fc antibody. \n\n\n In one embodiment, an Fc variant antibody has enhanced binding to one or more Fc ligand relative to a native Fc antibody. In another embodiment, the Fc variant antibody exhibits increased or decreased affinity for an Fc ligand that is at least 2 fold, or at least 3 fold, or at least 5 fold, or at least 7 fold, or a least 10 fold, or at least 20 fold, or at least 30 fold, or at least 40 fold, or at least 50 fold, or at least 60 fold, or at least 70 fold, or at least 80 fold, or at least 90 fold, or at least 100 fold, or at least 200 fold, or is between 2 fold and 10 fold, or between 5 fold and 50 fold, or between 25 fold and 100 fold, or between 75 fold and 200 fold, or between 100 and 200 fold, more or less than a native Fc antibody. In another embodiment, Fc variant antibodies exhibit affinities for an Fc ligand that are at least 90%, at least 80%, at least 70%, at least 60%, at least 50%, at least 40%, at least 30%, at least 20%, at least 10%, or at least 5% more or less than an native Fc antibody. In certain embodiments, an Fc variant antibody has increased affinity for an Fc ligand. In other embodiments, an Fc variant antibody has decreased affinity for an Fc ligand. \n\n\n In a specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody has enhanced binding to the Fc receptor FcyRIIIA. In another specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody has enhanced \n\n binding to the Fc receptor FcyRIIB . In a further specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody has enhanced binding to both the Fc receptors FcyRIIIA and FcyRIIB . In certain \n\n\nembodiments, Fc variant antibodies that have enhanced binding to FcyRIIIA do not have a concomitant increase in binding the FcyRIIB receptor as compared to a native Fc antibody. In a specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody has reduced binding to the Fc receptor FcyRIIIA. In a further specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody has reduced binding to the Fc receptor FcyRIIB . In still another specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody exhibiting altered affinity for FcyRIIIA and/or FcyRIIB has enhanced binding to the Fc receptor FcRn. In yet another specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody exhibiting altered affinity for FcyRIIIA and/or FcyRIIB has altered binding to Clq relative to a native Fc antibody. \n\n\n In one embodiment, Fc variant antibodies exhibit affinities for FcyRIIIA receptor that are at least 2 fold, or at least 3 fold, or at least 5 fold, or at least 7 fold, or a least 10 fold, or at least 20 fold, or at least 30 fold, or at least 40 fold, or at least 50 fold, or at least 60 fold, or at least 70 fold, or at least 80 fold, or at least 90 fold, or at least 100 fold, or at least 200 fold, or are between 2 fold and 10 fold, or between 5 fold and 50 fold, or between 25 fold and 100 fold, or between 75 fold and 200 fold, or between 100 and 200 fold, more or less than an native Fc antibody.

In still another specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody exhibiting altered affinity for Clq has enhanced binding to the Fc receptor FcRn. In yet another specific embodiment, an Fc variant antibody exhibiting altered affinity for Clq has altered binding to FcyRIIIA and/or FcyRIIB relative to a native Fc antibody. \n\n\n It is well known in the art that antibodies are capable of directing the attack and destruction of targeted antigen through multiple processes collectively known in the art as antibody effector functions. One of these processes, known as \"antibody-dependent cell- mediated cytotoxicity\" or \"ADCC\" refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors (FcRs) present on certain cytotoxic cells (e.g., Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) enables these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen-bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. \n\n\nSpecific high-affinity IgG antibodies directed to the surface of target cells \"arm\" the cytotoxic cells and are required for such killing. Lysis of the target cell is extracellular, requires direct cell-to-cell contact, and does not involve complement. Another process encompassed by the term effector function is complement dependent cytotoxicity (hereinafter referred to as \"CDC\") which refers to a biochemical event of antibody-mediated target cell destruction by the complement system. The complement system is a complex system of proteins found in normal blood plasma that combines with antibodies to destroy pathogenic bacteria and other foreign cells. Still another process encompassed by the term effector function is antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) which refers to a cell- mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express one or more effector ligands recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell. \n\n\n It is contemplated that Fc variant antibodies are characterized by in vitro functional assays for determining one or more FcyR mediated effector cell functions. In certain embodiments, Fc variant antibodies have similar binding properties and effector cell functions in in vivo models (such as those described and disclosed herein) as those in in vitro \n\n based assays. However, the present invention does not exclude Fc variant antibodies that do not exhibit the desired phenotype in in vitro based assays but do exhibit the desired phenotype in vivo. \n\n\n The serum half-life of proteins comprising Fc regions may be increased by increasing the binding affinity of the Fc region for FcRn. The term \"antibody half-life\" as used herein means a pharmacokinetic property of an antibody that is a measure of the mean survival time of antibody molecules following their administration. Antibody half-life can be expressed as the time required to eliminate 50 percent of a known quantity of immunoglobulin from the patient' s body (or other mammal) or a specific compartment thereof, for example, as measured in serum, i.e., circulating half-life, or in other tissues. Half-life may vary from one immunoglobulin or class of immunoglobulin to another. In general, an increase in antibody half-life results in an increase in mean residence time (MRT) in circulation for the antibody administered. \n\n\n The increase in half-life allows for the reduction in amount of drug given to a patient as well as reducing the frequency of administration. To increase the serum half life of the antibody, one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody \n\n\n(especially an antibody fragment) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277, for example. As used herein, the term \"salvage receptor binding epitope\" refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the IgG molecule. Alternatively, antibodies of the invention with increased half-lives may be generated by modifying amino acid residues identified as involved in the interaction between the Fc and the FcRn receptor (see, for examples, US Patent Nos. 6,821,505 and 7,083,784; and WO 09/058492). In addition, the half-life of antibodies of the invention may be increase by conjugation to PEG or Albumin by techniques widely utilized in the art. In some embodiments antibodies comprising Fc variant regions of the invention have an increased half-life of about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about 100%, about 125%, about 150% or more as compared to an antibody comprising a native Fc region. In some embodiments antibodies comprising Fc variant regions have an increased half-life of about 2 fold, about 3 fold, about 4 fold, about 5 fold, about 10 fold, about 20 fold, about 50 fold or more, or is between 2 fold and 10 fold, or between 5 fold and 25 fold, or between 15 fold and 50 fold, as compared to an antibody comprising a native Fc region. \n\n In one embodiment, the present invention provides Fc variants, wherein the Fc region comprises a modification (e.g., amino acid substitutions, amino acid insertions, amino acid deletions) at one or more positions selected from the group consisting of 221, 225, 228, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 243, 244, 245, 247, 250, 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 279, 280, 284, 292, 296, 297, 298, 299, 305, 308, 313, 316, 318, 320, 322, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 339, 341, 343, 370, 373, 378, 392, 416, 419, 421, 428, 433, 434, 435, 436, 440, and 443 as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. Optionally, the Fc region may comprise a modification at additional and/or alternative positions known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patents 5,624,821; 6,277,375; 6,737,056; 7,083,784; 7,317,091; 7,217,797; 7,276,585; 7,355,008;\n\n\n2002/0147311; 2004/0002587; 2005/0215768; 2007/0135620; 2007/0224188; 2008/0089892; WO 94/29351; and WO 99/58572).

Optionally, the Fc region may comprise additional and/or alternative amino acid substitutions known to one skilled in the art including but not limited too those exemplified in Tables 2, and 6- 10 of US 6,737,056; the tables presented in Figure 41 of US 2006/024298; the tables presented in Figures 5, 12, and 15 of US 2006/235208; the tables presented in Figures 8, 9 and 10 of US 2006/0173170 and the tables presented in Figures 8, 9 and 10 of WO 09/058492. \n\n\n In a specific embodiment, the present invention provides an Fc variant antibody having increased half-life, wherein the Fc region comprises at least one modification at one or more positions selected from the group consisting of 252, 254, and 256 as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. In one embodiment, the modification is at least one substitution selected from the group consisting of 252Y, 254T and 256E as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. See, U.S. Patent Number 7,083,784, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Fc variant antibodies having increased half-life are particularly well suited for therapeutic use where epithelial or mucocutaneous administration is desirable (see, e.g., U.S. 7,658,921). In certain embodiments, the invention provides methods for preventing and/or treating and/or preventing or treating exacerbation of symptoms of HRV and/or CV-A and/or Plasmodium falciparum infection by epithelial or mucocutaneous administration of an Fc variant antibody of the invention comprising at least one modification at one or more positions selected from the group consisting of 252, 254, and 256 as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. \n\n\n In a specific embodiment, the present invention provides an Fc variant antibody having reduced effector function, wherein the Fc region comprises at least one modification (e.g., amino acid substitutions, amino acid insertions, amino acid deletions) at one or more positions selected from the group consisting of 228, 234, 235 and 331 as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. In one embodiment, the modification is at least one substitution selected from the group consisting of 228P, 234F, 235E, 235F, 235Y, and 33 IS as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. In another embodiment, the Fc variant antibody having reduced effector function further comprises at least one modification at one or more positions selected from the group consisting of 252, 254, and 256 as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. In one embodiment, the modification is at least one substitution selected from the group consisting of 252Y, 254T and 256E as numbered by the EU index as \n\n set forth in Kabat. In another specific embodiment, the present invention provides an Fc variant antibody having reduced effector function, wherein the Fc region is an IgG4 Fc region and comprises at least one modification at one or more positions selected from the group consisting of 228 and 235 as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. In still another specific embodiment, the Fc region is an IgG4 Fc region and the non-naturally occurring amino acids are selected from the group consisting of 228P, 235E, 235F and 235Y as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. In another embodiment, the Fc variant antibody having reduced effector function further comprises at least one modification at one or more positions selected from the group consisting of 252, 254, and 256 as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. In one embodiment, the modification is at least one substitution selected from the group consisting of 252Y, 254T and 256E as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. \n\n\n In another specific embodiment, the present invention provides an Fc variant having enhanced effector function, wherein the Fc region comprises at least one modification at one or more positions selected from the group consisting of 239, 330 and 332 as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. In one embodiment, the modification is at least one substitution selected from the group consisting of 239D, 330L, 330Y, and 332E as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. In another embodiment, the Fc variant antibody having enhanced effector function further comprises at least one modification at one or more positions selected from the group consisting of 252, 254, and 256 as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. In one embodiment, the modification is at least one substitution selected from the group consisting of 252Y, 254T and 256E as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. \n\n\n In certain embodiments the effector functions elicited by IgG antibodies strongly depend on the carbohydrate moiety linked to the Fc region of the protein (Claudia Ferrara et al., 2006, Biotechnology and Bioengineering 93:851-861). Thus, glycosylation of the Fc region can be modified to increase or decrease effector function (see for examples, Umana et al, 1999, Nat. Biotechnol 17:176-180; Davies et al., 2001, Biotechnol Bioeng 74:288-294; Shields et al, 2002, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740; Shinkawa et al., 2003, J Biol Chem 278:3466-3473; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,602,684; 6,946,292; 7,064,191; 7,214,775;7,393,683; \n\n\n 7,425,446; 7,504,256; U.S. Publication. Nos. 2003/0157108; 2003/0003097; 2009/0010921; POTILLEGENT™ technology (Biowa, Inc. Princeton, N.J.); GLYCOMAB™ glycosylation engineering technology (GLYCART biotechnology AG, Zurich, Switzerland)). Accordingly, in one embodiment the Fc regions of anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies of the invention comprise \n\n altered glycosylation of amino acid residues. In another embodiment, the altered \n\n\nglycosylation of the amino acid residues results in lowered effector function. In another embodiment, the altered glycosylation of the amino acid residues results in increased effector function. In a specific embodiment, the Fc region has reduced fucosylation. In another embodiment, the Fc region is afucosylated (see for examples, U.S. Patent Application Publication No.2005/0226867). In one aspect, these antibodies with increased effector function, specifically ADCC, as generated in host cells (e.g., CHO cells, Lemna minor) engineered to produce highly defucosylated antibody with over 100-fold higher ADCC compared to antibody produced by the parental cells (Mori et al., 2004, Biotechnol Bioeng 88:901-908; Cox et al., 2006, Nat Biotechnol., 24: 1591-7). \n\n\n Addition of sialic acid to the oligosaccharides on IgG molecules can enhance their anti-inflammatory activity and alters their cytotoxicity (Keneko et al., Science, 2006, 313:670-673; Scallon et al., Mol. Immuno. 2007 Mar;44(7): 1524-34). The studies referenced above demonstrate that IgG molecules with increased sialylation have anti-inflammatory properties whereas IgG molecules with reduced sialylation have increased \n\n\nimmuno stimulatory properties (e.g., increase ADCC activity). Therefore, an antibody can be modified with an appropriate sialylation profile for a particular therapeutic application (US Publication No. 2009/0004179 and International Publication No. WO 2007/005786). \n\n\n In one embodiment, the Fc regions of antibodies of the invention comprise an altered sialylation profile compared to the native Fc region. In one embodiment, the Fc regions of antibodies of the invention comprise an increased sialylation profile compared to the native Fc region. In another embodiment, the Fc regions of antibodies of the invention comprise a decreased sialylation profile compared to the native Fc region. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other known Fc variants such as those disclosed in Ghetie et al., 1997, Nat Biotech. 15:637- 40; Duncan et al, 1988, Nature 332:563-564; Lund et al., 1991, J.

Other modifications and/or substitutions and/or additions and/or deletions of the Fc domain will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art. \n\n\n (B) Glycosylation \n\n\n In addition to the ability of glycosylation to alter the effector function of antibodies, modified glycosylation in the variable region can alter the affinity of the antibody for a target antigen. In one embodiment, the glycosylation pattern in the variable region of the present antibodies is modified. For example, an aglycoslated antibody can be made (i.e., the antibody lacks glycosylation). Glycosylation can be altered to, for example, increase the affinity of the antibody for a target antigen. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region framework glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation may increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,714,350 and 6,350,861. One or more amino acid substitutions can also be made that result in elimination of a glycosylation site present in the Fc region (e.g., Asparagine 297 of IgG). Furthermore, aglycosylated antibodies may be produced in bacterial cells which lack the necessary glycosylation machinery. \n\n\n (C) Antibody Conjugates \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are conjugated or covalently attached to a substance using methods well known in the art. In one embodiment, the attached substance is a therapeutic agent, a detectable label (also referred to herein as a reporter molecule) or a solid support. Suitable substances for attachment to antibodies include, but are not limited to, an amino acid, a peptide, a protein, a polysaccharide, a nucleoside, a nucleotide, an oligonucleotide, a nucleic acid, a hapten, a drug, a hormone, a lipid, a lipid assembly, a synthetic polymer, a polymeric microparticle, a biological cell, a virus, a fluorophore, a chromophore, a dye, a toxin, a hapten, an enzyme, an antibody, an antibody fragment, a radioisotope, solid matrixes, semi-solid matrixes and combinations \n\n thereof. Methods for conjugation or covalently attaching another substance to an antibody are well known in the art. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are conjugated to a solid support. Antibodies may be conjugated to a solid support as part of the screening and/or purification and/or manufacturing process. Alternatively antibodies of the invention may be conjugated to a solid support as part of a diagnostic method or composition. A solid support suitable for use in the present invention is typically substantially insoluble in liquid phases. A large number of supports are available and are known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, solid supports include solid and semi-solid matrixes, such as aerogels and hydrogels, resins, beads, biochips (including thin film coated biochips), microfluidic chip, a silicon chip, multi-well plates (also referred to as microtitre plates or microplates), membranes, conducting and nonconducting metals, glass (including microscope slides) and magnetic supports. More specific examples of solid supports include silica gels, polymeric \n\n\nmembranes, particles, derivatized plastic films, glass beads, cotton, plastic beads, alumina gels, polysaccharides such as Sepharose, poly(acrylate), polystyrene, poly(acrylamide), polyol, agarose, agar, cellulose, dextran, starch, FICOLL, heparin, glycogen, amylopectin, mannan, inulin, nitrocellulose, diazocellulose, polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, \n\n\npolyethylene (including poly(ethylene glycol)), nylon, latex bead, magnetic bead, paramagnetic bead, superparamagnetic bead, starch and the like. \n\n\nIn some embodiments, the solid support may include a reactive functional group, including, but not limited to, hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, thiol, aldehyde, halogen, nitro, cyano, amido, urea, carbonate, carbamate, isocyanate, sulfone, sulfonate, sulfonamide, sulfoxide, etc., for attaching the antibodies of the invention. \n\n\n A suitable solid phase support can be selected on the basis of desired end use and suitability for various synthetic protocols. For example, where amide bond formation is desirable to attach the antibodies of the invention to the solid support, resins generally useful in peptide synthesis may be employed, such as polystyrene (e.g., PAM-resin obtained from Bachem Inc., Peninsula Laboratories, etc.), POLYHIPE™ resin (obtained from Aminotech, Canada), polyamide resin (obtained from Peninsula Laboratories), polystyrene resin grafted with polyethylene glycol (TENTAGEL™, Rapp Polymere, Tubingen, Germany), poly dimethyl- acrylamide resin (available from Milligen/Biosearch, California), or PEGA beads (obtained from Polymer Laboratories). \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are conjugated to labels for purposes of diagnostics and other assays wherein the antibody and/or its associated ligand \n\n may be detected. A label conjugated to an antibody and used in the present methods and compositions described herein, is any chemical moiety, organic or inorganic, that exhibits an absorption maximum at wavelengths greater than 280 nm, and retains its spectral properties when covalently attached to an antibody. Labels include, without limitation, a chromophore, a fluorophore, a fluorescent protein, a phosphorescent dye, a tandem dye, a particle, a hapten, an enzyme and a radioisotope. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies are conjugated to a fluorophore. As such, fluorophores used to label antibodies of the invention include, without limitation; a pyrene (including any of the corresponding derivative compounds disclosed in US Patent 5,132,432), an anthracene, a naphthalene, an acridine, a stilbene, an indole or benzindole, an oxazole or benzoxazole, a thiazole or benzothiazole, a 4-amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-l, 3- diazole (NBD), a cyanine (including any corresponding compounds in US Patent \n\n\nNos.6,977,305 and 6,974,873), a carbocyanine (including any corresponding compounds in US Serial Nos. 09/557,275; U.S.; Patents Nos. 4,981,977; 5,268,486; 5,569,587; 5,569,766; 5,486,616; 5,627,027; 5,808,044; 5,877,310; 6,002,003; 6,004,536; 6,008,373; 6,043,025; 6,127,134; 6,130,094; 6,133,445; and publications WO 02/26891, WO 97/40104, WO 99/51702, WO 01/21624; EP 1 065 250 Al), a carbostyryl, a porphyrin, a salicylate, an anthranilate, an azulene, a perylene, a pyridine, a quinoline, a borapolyazaindacene (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in US Patent Nos. 4,774,339; 5,187,288; 5,248,782; 5,274,113; and 5,433,896), a xanthene (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,162,931; 6,130,101; 6,229,055; 6,339,392; 5,451,343; 5,227,487; \n\n\n5,442,045; 5,798,276; 5,846,737; 4,945,171; US serial Nos. 09/129,015 and 09/922,333), an oxazine (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in US Patent No. 4,714,763) or a benzoxazine, a carbazine (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in US Patent No. 4,810,636), a phenalenone, a coumarin (including an corresponding compounds disclosed in US Patent Nos. 5,696,157; 5,459,276; 5,501,980 and 5,830,912), a benzofuran (including an corresponding compounds disclosed in US Patent Nos. 4,603,209 and \n\n\n4,849,362) and benzphenalenone (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in US Patent No. 4,812,409) and derivatives thereof. As used herein, oxazines include resorufins (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in 5,242,805), aminooxazinones, diaminooxazines, and their benzo-substituted analogs. \n\n\n In a specific embodiment, the fluorophores conjugated to the antibodies described herein include xanthene (rhodol, rhodamine, fluorescein and derivatives thereof) coumarin, cyanine, pyrene, oxazine and borapolyazaindacene. In other embodiments, such fluorophores \n\n are sulfonated xanthenes, fluorinated xanthenes, sulfonated coumarins, fluonnated coumarins and sulfonated cyanines. Also included are dyes sold under the tradenames, and generally known as, Alexa Fluor, DyLight, Cy Dyes, BODIPY, Oregon Green, Pacific Blue, IRDyes, FAM, FITC, and ROX. \n\n\n The choice of the fluorophore attached to the anti-ICAM- 1 antibody will determine the absorption and fluorescence emission properties of the conjugated antibody. Physical properties of a fluorophore label that can be used for antibody and antibody bound ligands include, but are not limited to, spectral characteristics (absorption, emission and stokes shift), fluorescence intensity, lifetime, polarization and photo-bleaching rate, or combination thereof. All of these physical properties can be used to distinguish one fluorophore from another, and thereby allow for multiplexed analysis. In certain embodiments, the fluorophore has an absorption maximum at wavelengths greater than 480 nm. In other embodiments, the fluorophore absorbs at or near 488 nm to 514 nm (particularly suitable for excitation by the output of the argon-ion laser excitation source) or near 546 nm (particularly suitable for excitation by a mercury arc lamp). In other embodiment a fluorophore can emit in the NIR (near infra red region) for tissue or whole organism applications. Other desirable properties of the fluorescent label may include cell permeability and low toxicity, for example if labeling of the antibody is to be performed in a cell or an organism (e.g., a living animal). \n\n\n In certain embodiments, an enzyme is a label and is conjugated to an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody. Enzymes are desirable labels because amplification of the detectable signal can be obtained resulting in increased assay sensitivity. The enzyme itself does not produce a detectable response but functions to break down a substrate when it is contacted by an appropriate substrate such that the converted substrate produces a fluorescent, colorimetric or luminescent signal. Enzymes amplify the detectable signal because one enzyme on a labeling reagent can result in multiple substrates being converted to a detectable signal. The enzyme substrate is selected to yield the preferred measurable product, e.g. colorimetric, fluorescent or chemiluminescence. Such substrates are extensively used in the art and are well known by one skilled in the art. \n\n\n In one embodiment, colorimetric or fluorogenic substrate and enzyme combination uses oxidoreductases such as horseradish peroxidase and a substrate such as 3,3'- diaminobenzidine (DAB) and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC), which yield a distinguishing color (brown and red, respectively). Other colorimetric oxidoreductase substrates that yield detectable products include, but are not limited to: 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6- sulfonic acid) (ABTS), o-phenylenediamine (OPD), 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), \n\n odianisidine, 5-aminosalicylic acid, 4-chloro- l-naphthol. Fluorogenic substrates include, but are not limited to, homovanillic acid or 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid, reduced phenoxazines and reduced benzothiazines, including AMPLEX\n®\n Red reagent and its variants (U.S. Pat. No. 4,384,042) and reduced dihydroxanthenes, including dihydrofluoresceins (U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,931) and dihydrorhodamines including dihydrorhodamine 123. Peroxidase substrates that are tyramides (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,196,306; 5,583,001 and 5,731,158) represent a unique class of peroxidase substrates in that they can be intrinsically detectable before action of the enzyme but are \"fixed in place\" by the action of a peroxidase in the process described as tyramide signal amplification (TSA). These substrates are extensively utilized to label targets in samples that are cells, tissues or arrays for their subsequent detection by microscopy, flow cytometry, optical scanning and fluorometry. \n\n\n In another embodiment, a colorimetric (and in some cases fluorogenic) substrate and enzyme combination uses a phosphatase enzyme such as an acid phosphatase, an alkaline phosphatase or a recombinant version of such a phosphatase in combination with a colorimetric substrate such as 5-bromo-6-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP), 6-chloro-3- indolyl phosphate, 5-bromo-6-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, or o- nitrophenyl phosphate or with a fluorogenic substrate such as 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, 6,8-difluoro-7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarinyl phosphate (DiFMUP, U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,912) fluorescein diphosphate, 3-0-methylfluorescein phosphate, resorufin phosphate, 9H-(l,3-dichloro-9,9-dimethylacridin-2-one-7-yl) phosphate (DDAO phosphate), or ELF 97, ELF 39 or related phosphates (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,316,906 and 5,443,986). \n\n\n Glycosidases, in particular beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase and beta- glucosidase, are additional suitable enzymes. Appropriate colorimetric substrates include, but are not limited to, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and similar indolyl galactosides, glucosides, and glucuronides, o-nitrophenyl beta-D- galactopyranoside (ONPG) and p-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside. In one \n\n\nembodiment, fluorogenic substrates include resorufin beta-D-galactopyranoside, fluorescein digalactoside (FDG), fluorescein diglucuronide and their structural variants (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,148; 5,242,805; 5,362,628; 5,576,424 and 5,773,236), 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-D- galactopyranoside, carboxyumbelliferyl beta-D-galactopyranoside and fluorinated coumarin beta-D-galactopyranosides (U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,912). \n\n\n Additional enzymes include, but are not limited to, hydrolases such as cholinesterases and peptidases, oxidases such as glucose oxidase and cytochrome oxidases, and reductases for which suitable substrates are known. \n\n Enzymes and their appropriate substrates that produce chemiluminescence are preferred for some assays. These include, but are not limited to, natural and recombinant forms of luciferases and aequorins. Chemiluminescence-producing substrates for phosphatases, glycosidases and oxidases such as those containing stable dioxetanes, luminol, isoluminol and acridinium esters are additionally useful. \n\n\n In another embodiment, haptens such as biotin, are also utilized as labels. Biotin is useful because it can function in an enzyme system to further amplify the detectable signal, and it can function as a tag to be used in affinity chromatography for isolation purposes. For detection purposes, an enzyme conjugate that has affinity for biotin is used, such as avidin- HRP. Subsequently a peroxidase substrate is added to produce a detectable signal. \n\n\n Haptens also include hormones, naturally occurring and synthetic drugs, pollutants, allergens, affector molecules, growth factors, chemokines, cytokines, lymphokines, amino acids, peptides, chemical intermediates, nucleotides and the like. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, fluorescent proteins may be conjugated to the antibodies as a label. Examples of fluorescent proteins include green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the phycobiliproteins and the derivatives thereof. The fluorescent proteins, especially phycobiliprotein, are particularly useful for creating tandem dye labeled labeling reagents. These tandem dyes comprise a fluorescent protein and a fluorophore for the purposes of obtaining a larger stokes shift wherein the emission spectra is farther shifted from the wavelength of the fluorescent protein's absorption spectra. This is particularly advantageous for detecting a low quantity of a target in a sample wherein the emitted fluorescent light is maximally optimized, in other words little to none of the emitted light is reabsorbed by the fluorescent protein. For this to work, the fluorescent protein and fluorophore function as an energy transfer pair wherein the fluorescent protein emits at the wavelength that the fluorophore absorbs at and the fluorphore then emits at a wavelength farther from the fluorescent proteins than could have been obtained with only the fluorescent protein. A particularly useful combination is the phycobiliproteins disclosed in US Patent Nos. \n\n\n4,520,110; 4,859,582; 5,055,556 and the sulforhodamine fluorophores disclosed in US Patent No. 5,798,276, or the sulfonated cyanine fluorophores disclosed in US Patent Nos. 6,977,305 and 6,974,873; or the sulfonated xanthene derivatives disclosed in US Patent No. 6,130,101 and those combinations disclosed in US Patent No. 4,542,104. Alternatively, the fluorophore functions as the energy donor and the fluorescent protein is the energy acceptor. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the label is a radioactive isotope. Examples of suitable radioactive materials include, but are not limited to, iodine (\n121\nI, \n123\nI, \n125\nI, \n131\nI), carbon (\n14\nC), \n\n sulfur (\n35\nS), tritium (\n3\nH), indium (\nη ι\nΙη,' \n112\nIn, \n113\nmln, \n115\nmln,), technetium (\n99\nTc, \n99\nmTc), thallium (\n201\nTi), gallium (\n68\nGa, \n67\nGa), palladium (\n103\nPd), molybdenum (\n99\nMo), xenon (\n135\nXe), fluorine (\n18\nF), \n153\nSM, \n177\nLu, \n159\nGd, \n149\nPm, \n140\nLa, \n175\nYb, \n166\nHo, \n90\nY, \n47\nSc, \n186\nRe, \n188\nRe,\n142\nPr, \n105\n Rh and \n97\nRu. \n\n\n(vi) Methods of Use \n\n\n (a) Diagnostic Methods of Use \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies and compositions thereof of the invention may be used in vivo and/or in vitro for detecting ICAM-1 expression in cells and tissue or for imaging ICAM-1 expressing cells and tissues. In certain embodiments, the antibodies are human antibodies and such antibodies are used to image ICAM-1 expression in a living human patient. Given that the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies and antibody fragments described herein immunospecifically bind to human ICAM-1 and inhibit binding of human ICAM-1 to human rhinovirus, but do not substantially inhibit binding of human ICAM-1 to LFAl and/or MAC-1, these antibodies can be used to detect or image ICAM-1 expression in a living patients without compromising the patient's normal immune function. \n\n\n By way of example, diagnostic uses can be achieved, for example, by contacting a sample to be tested, optionally along with a control sample, with the antibody under conditions that allow for formation of a complex between the antibody and ICAM- 1. \n\n\nComplex formation is then detected (e.g., using an ELISA or by imaging to detect a moiety attached to the antibody). When using a control sample along with the test sample, complex is detected in both samples and any statistically significant difference in the formation of complexes between the samples is indicative of the presence of ICAM-1 in the test sample. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of determining the presence of ICAM-1 in a sample suspected of containing ICAM-1, said method comprising exposing the sample to an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody of the invention, and determining binding of the antibody to ICAM- 1 in the sample wherein binding of the antibody to ICAM- 1 in the sample is indicative of the presence of the ICAM-1 in the sample. In one embodiment, the sample is a biological sample. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies may be used to detect the overexpression or amplification of ICAM-1 using an in vivo diagnostic assay. In one embodiment, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibody is added to a sample wherein the antibody binds the \n\n ICAM-1 to be detected and is tagged with a detectable label (e.g. a radioactive isotope or a fluorescent label) and externally scanning the patient for localization of the label. \n\n\n Alternatively, or additionally, FISH assays such as the INFORM™ (sold by Ventana, Ariz.) or PATHVISION™ (Vysis, 111.) may be carried out on formalin-fixed, paraffin- embedded tissue to determine the extent (if any) of ICAM-1 expression or overexpression in a sample. \n\n\n (b) Therapeutic Methods of Uses \n\n\n In certain aspects, the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies and compositions thereof of the invention may be administered for prevention and/or treatment of human rhinovirus infection in a subject in need thereof. The invention encompasses methods of preventing, treating, maintaining, ameliorating, or inhibiting a human rhinovirus associated or exacerbated disease/disorder/condition and/or preventing and/or alleviating one or more symptoms of the disease in a mammal, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the anti-ICAM-1 antibody to the mammal. The antibody therapeutic compositions can be administered short term (acute) or chronic, or intermittently as directed by physician. In certain embodiments, the rhinovirus includes HRV14 and/or HRV16. \n\n\n In certain aspects, the invention provides a method of treating and/or preventing human rhinovirus infection in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of the antibody or antibody fragment of the invention. In certain embodiments, treating or preventing human rhinovirus infection is used to treat and/or prevent exacerbation of a respiratory condition. In certain embodiments, the respiratory condition is selected from one or more members of the group consisting of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury (ALI), asthma, emphysema, bronchitis, tuberculosis, pneumonia, lung cancer, asbestosis, and cystic fibrosis. In certain embodiments, the method is part of a therapeutic regimen for treating the respiratory disorder. In certain embodiments, the rhinovirus includes HRV14 and/or HRV16. \n\n\n In certain aspects, the invention provides a method for inhibiting human rhinovirus infection of a cell expressing human ICAM-1, comprising contacting the cell with the antibody or antibody fragment of the invention to inhibit binding of human rhinovirus to human ICAM-1, thereby inhibiting human rhinovirus infection of said cell. In certain embodiments, the antibody or antibody fragment does not inhibit binding of ICAM-1 to \n\n LFA1 by greater than 60%. In certain embodiments, the rhinovirus includes HRV14 and/or HRV16. \n\n\n Any of the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies and antibody fragments having any one or more of the structural and functional features described herein can be used in a method of treating a human patient. \n\n\n When the antibodies are used to help treat or prevent exacerbation of a respiratory condition, the antibodies may be used alone or used as part of a therapeutic regimen specific to the particular underlying respiratory condition. For example, additional treatment modalities that can be used include, but are not limited to, oxygen therapy, steroidal therapy, smoking cessation, bronchial dilators, lung reduction surgery, and the like. Additionally or alternatively, the antibodies may be used alone or used as part of a regimen for managing or preventing rhinovirus infection. Patient with COPD and other serious respiratory conditions are at great risk of exacerbation of their symptoms if they become infected with human rhinovirus. Thus, in certain embodiments, patients at risk of exacerbation of their symptoms, for example patients at risk for COPD exacerbation, are treated with an antibody or antibody fragment of the invention to help prevent or reduce the risk of HRV infection. As a result, such prophylactic administration helps decrease the risk of exacerbation. \n\n\n The invention provides a composition comprising an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody of the invention and a carrier. For the purposes of treating and/or preventing HRV associated or exacerbated disease/condition, compositions can be administered to the patient in need of such treatment, wherein the composition can comprise one or more anti-ICAM-1 antibodies present as an immunoconjugate or as the naked antibody. In a further embodiment, the compositions can comprise these antibodies in combination with other therapeutic agents such as bronchodilators, such as ipratropium, tiotropium, salmeterol, or formoterol, steroids, anti-viral agents and antibiotics. In certain embodiments, the compositions can comprise these antibodies in combination with surgery such as lung volume reduction surgery or lung transplantation. In certain embodiments, the compositions can comprise these antibodies in combination with therapy such as oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation or smoking cessation. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the compositions and/or methods of the invention may improve symptoms of a subject with a chronic lung disease such as COPD or asthma. \n\n\nWithout being bound by theory, by preventing rhinovirus infection, the antibodies of the invention can be used to prevent exacerbation of symptoms of a respiratory condition. \n\n Symptoms of chronic lung disease can include cough with mucus, shortness of breath (dyspnea) that may get worse with mild activity, fatigue, frequent respiratory infections, wheezing, chest tightness, irregular heart beats (arrhythmias), need for breathing machine and oxygen therapy, right- sided heart failure or cor pulmonale (heart swelling and heart failure due to chronic lung disease), frequent respiratory infections, pneumonia, pneumothorax, severe weight loss and malnutrition. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, chronic lung disease is diagnosed and/or monitored before, during or after treatment, which may include preventative treatment. In certain embodiments, monitoring is continuous. In certain embodiments, monitoring occurs over regular intervals during treatment, such as hourly, daily or weekly. In certain embodiments, monitoring occurs over regular intervals after treatment, such as daily, weekly or monthly. Intervals for monitoring may be readily determined by one of skill in the art based on the severity of the condition. In certain embodiments, chronic lung disease is diagnosed and/or monitored by a pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. In certain embodiments, chronic lung disease is diagnosed and/or monitored by chest X-ray and/or a computerized tomography (CT) scan. A chest X-ray or CT scan can show emphysema, which is one of the main causes of COPD. In certain embodiments, chronic lung disease is diagnosed and/or monitored by arterial blood gas analysis. In certain embodiments, chronic lung disease is diagnosed and/or monitored by sputum examination. Additionally, asthma can be diagnosed or monitored by an exhaled nitric oxide test and/or a challenge test. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, a composition or method of the invention is analyzed in an animal rhinovirus model or chronic lung disease model that is know to one of ordinary skill in the art. (e.g., Contoli et al., Contrib Microbiol. 2007;14:101-12). In certain embodiments, the animal model is a mouse model (e.g., Bartlett et al., Nat Med. 2008 Feb; 14(2): 199-204). In certain embodiments, the mouse model is selected from an elastase- and LPS-exposed mouse model (see, Sajjan et al., Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2009 \n\n\nNov;297(5):L931-44). \n\n\n In certain aspects, the anti-ICAM-1 antibodies and compositions thereof of the invention may be administered for prevention and/or treatment of CV-A infection in a subject in need thereof. The invention encompasses methods of preventing, treating, maintaining, ameliorating, or inhibiting a CV-A associated or exacerbated disease/disorder/condition and/or preventing and/or alleviating one or more symptoms of the disease in a mammal, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the anti-IC AM- 1 antibody to \n\n the mammal. The antibody therapeutic compositions can be administered short term (acute) or chronic, or intermittently as directed by physician. In certain embodiments, the CV-A includes CV-A21 and/or CV-A 16. \n\n\n In certain aspects, the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies and compositions thereof of the invention may be administered for prevention and/or treatment of Plasmodium falciparum infection in a subject in need thereof. The invention encompasses methods of preventing, treating, maintaining, ameliorating or inhibiting a Plasmodium falciparum associated or exacerbated disease/disorder/condition and/or preventing and/or alleviating one or more symptoms of the disease in a mammal, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the anti-ICAM- 1 antibody to the mammal. The antibody therapeutic compositions can be administered short term (acute) or chronic, or intermittently as directed by physician. In other aspects anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies and compositions thereof of the invention may be administered for prevention and/or inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum-iniected \n\n\nerythrocytes adhering to endothelial cells in a subject in need thereof. \n\n\n (vii) Pharmaceutical Formulations \n\n\n This section of the specification describes various exemplary preparations and formulations comprising anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies (including antibody fragments) of the present disclosure.

Commonly used excipients/additives, such as pharmaceutically acceptable chelators (for example, but not limited to, EDTA, DTPA or EGTA) can optionally be added to the formulations of the invention to reduce aggregation. These additives are particularly useful if a pump or plastic container is used to administer the formulation. \n\n\n Preservatives, such as phenol, m-cresol, p-cresol, o-cresol, chlorocresol, benzyl alcohol, phenylmercuric nitrite, phenoxyethanol, formaldehyde, chlorobutanol, magnesium chloride (for example, but not limited to, hexahydrate), alkylparaben (methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and the like), benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, sodium dehydroacetate and thimerosal, or mixtures thereof can optionally be added to the formulations of the invention at any suitable concentration such as between about 0.001% to about 5%, or any range or value therein. The concentration of preservative used in the formulations of the invention is a concentration sufficient to yield a microbial effect. Such concentrations are dependent on the preservative selected and are readily determined by the skilled artisan. \n\n\n Other contemplated excipients/additives, which may be utilized in the formulations of the invention include, for example, flavoring agents, antimicrobial agents, sweeteners, antioxidants, antistatic agents, lipids such as phospholipids or fatty acids, steroids such as cholesterol, protein excipients such as serum albumin (human serum albumin (HSA), recombinant human albumin (rHA)), gelatin, casein, salt-forming counterions such as sodium and the like.

(2005). Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be routinely selected that are suitable for the mode of administration, solubility and/or stability of anti-ICAM- 1 antibody, as well known those in the art or as described herein. \n\n\n It will be understood by one skilled in the art that the formulations of the invention may be isotonic with human blood, wherein the formulations of the invention have essentially \n\n the same osmotic pressure as human blood. Such isotonic formulations will generally have an osmotic pressure from about 250 mOSm to about 350 mOSm. Isotonicity can be measured by, for example, using a vapor pressure or ice-freezing type osmometer. Tonicity of a formulation is adjusted by the use of tonicity modifiers. \"Tonicity modifiers\" are those pharmaceutically acceptable inert substances that can be added to the formulation to provide an isotonity of the formulation. Tonicity modifiers suitable for this invention include, but are not limited to, saccharides, salts and amino acids. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the formulations of the present invention have an osmotic pressure from about 100 mOSm to about 1200 mOSm, or from about 200 mOSm to about 1000 mOSm, or from about 200 mOSm to about 800 mOSm, or from about 200 mOSm to about 600 mOSm, or from about 250 mOSm to about 500 mOSm, or from about 250 mOSm to about 400 mOSm, or from about 250 mOSm to about 350 mOSm. \n\n\n The concentration of any one component or any combination of various components, of the formulations of the invention is adjusted to achieve the desired tonicity of the final formulation. For example, the ratio of the carbohydrate excipient to antibody may be adjusted according to methods known in the art (e.g. , U.S. Patent No. 6,685,940). In certain embodiments, the molar ratio of the carbohydrate excipient to antibody may be from about 100 moles to about 1000 moles of carbohydrate excipient to about 1 mole of antibody, or from about 200 moles to about 6000 moles of carbohydrate excipient to about 1 mole of antibody, or from about 100 moles to about 510 moles of carbohydrate excipient to about 1 mole of antibody, or from about 100 moles to about 600 moles of carbohydrate excipient to about 1 mole of antibody. \n\n\n The desired isotonicity of the final formulation may also be achieved by adjusting the salt concentration of the formulations. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts and those suitable for this invention as tonicity modifiers include, but are not limited to, sodium chloride, sodium succinate, sodium sulfate, potassuim chloride, magnesium chloride, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride. In specific embodiments, formulations of the inventions comprise NaCl, MgCl\n2\n, and/or CaCl\n2\n. In one embodiment, concentration of NaCl is between about 75 mM and about 150 mM. In another embodiment, concentration of MgCl\n2\n is between about 1 mM and about 100 mM. Pharmaceutically acceptable amino acids including those suitable for this invention as tonicity modifiers include, but are not limited to, proline, alanine, L-arginine, asparagine, L-aspartic acid, glycine, serine, lysine, and histidine. \n\n\n In one embodiment the formulations of the invention are pyrogen-free formulations which are substantially free of endotoxins and/or related pyrogenic substances. Endotoxins \n\n include toxins that are confined inside a microorganism and are released only when the microorganisms are broken down or die. Pyrogenic substances also include fever-inducing, thermostable substances (glycoproteins) from the outer membrane of bacteria and other microorganisms. Both of these substances can cause fever, hypotension and shock if administered to humans. Due to the potential harmful effects, even low amounts of endotoxins must be removed from intravenously administered pharmaceutical drug solutions. The Food & Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has set an upper limit of 5 endotoxin units (EU) per dose per kilogram body weight in a single one hour period for intravenous drug applications (The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Pharmacopeial Forum 26 (1):223 (2000)). When therapeutic proteins are administered in amounts of several hundred or thousand milligrams per kilogram body weight, as can be the case with antibodies, even trace amounts of harmful and dangerous endotoxin must be removed. In certain specific embodiments, the endotoxin and pyrogen levels in the composition are less then 10 EU/mg, or less then 5 EU/mg, or less then 1 EU/mg, or less then 0.1 EU/mg, or less then 0.01 EU/mg, or less then 0.001 EU/mg. \n\n\n When used for in vivo administration, the formulations of the invention should be sterile. The formulations of the invention may be sterilized by various sterilization methods, including sterile filtration, radiation, etc. In one embodiment, the antibody formulation is filter-sterilized with a presterilized 0.22-micron filter. Sterile compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice as described in \"Remington: The Science & Practice of Pharmacy\", 21\nst\n ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, (2005). \n\n\nFormulations comprising antibodies, such as those disclosed herein, ordinarily will be stored in lyophilized form or in solution. It is contemplated that sterile compositions comprising antibodies are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having an adapter that allows retrieval of the formulation, such as a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle. In one embodiment, a composition of the invention is provided as a pre-filled syringe. \n\n\n In one embodiment, a formulation of the invention is a lyophilized formulation. The term \"lyophilized\" or \"freeze-dried\" includes a state of a substance that has been subjected to a drying procedure such as lyophilization, where at least 50% of moisture has been removed. \n\n\n The phrase \"bulking agent\" includes a compound that is pharmaceutically acceptable and that adds bulk to a lyo cake. Bulking agents known to the art include, for example, carbohydrates, including simple sugars such as dextrose, ribose, fructose and the like, alcohol sugars such as mannitol, inositol and sorbitol, disaccharides including trehalose, sucrose and \n\n lactose, naturally occurring polymers such as starch, dextrans, chitosan, hyaluronate, proteins (e.g., gelatin and serum albumin), glycogen, and synthetic monomers and polymers. \n\n\n A \"lyoprotectant\" is a molecule which, when combined with a protein of interest (such as an anti-IC AM- 1 antibody), significantly prevents or reduces chemical and/or physical instability of the protein upon lyophilization and subsequent storage. Lyoprotectants include, but are not limited to, sugars and their corresponding sugar alchohols; an amino acid such as monosodium glutamate or histidine; a methylamine such as betaine; a lyotropic salt such as magnesium sulfate; a polyol such as trihydric or higher molecular weight sugar alcohols, e.g. glycerin, dextran, erythritol, glycerol, arabitol, xylitol, sorbitol, and mannitol; propylene glycol; polyethylene glycol; PLURONICS™; and combinations thereof. \n\n\n Additional examples of lyoprotectants include, but are not limited to, glycerin and gelatin, and the sugars mellibiose, melezitose, raffinose, mannotriose and stachyose. Examples of reducing sugars include, but are not limited to, glucose, maltose, lactose, maltulose, iso- maltulose and lactulose. Examples of non-reducing sugars include, but are not limited to, non-reducing glycosides of polyhydroxy compounds selected from sugar alcohols and other straight chain polyalcohols. Examples of sugar alcohols include, but are not limited to, monoglycosides, compounds obtained by reduction of disaccharides such as lactose, maltose, lactulose and maltulose. The glycosidic side group can be either glucosidic or galactosidic. Additional examples of sugar alcohols include, but are not limited to, glucitol, maltitol, lactitol and iso-maltulose. In specific embodiments, trehalose or sucrose is used as a lyoprotectant. \n\n\n The lyoprotectant is added to the pre-lyophilized formulation in a \"lyoprotecting amount\" which means that, following lyophilization of the protein in the presence of the lyoprotecting amount of the lyoprotectant, the protein essentially retains its physical and chemical stability and integrity upon lyophilization and storage. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the molar ratio of a lyoprotectant (e.g., trehalose) and anti- ICAM-1 antibody molecules of a formulation of the invention is at least about 10, at least about 50, at least about 100, at least about 200, or at least about 300. In another embodiment, the molar ratio of a lyoprotectant (e.g., trehalose) and anti-IC AM- 1 antibody molecules of a formulation of the invention is about 1, is about 2, is about 5, is about 10, about 50, about 100, about 200, or about 300. \n\n\n A \"reconstituted\" formulation is one which has been prepared by dissolving a lyophilized antibody formulation in a diluent such that the antibody is dispersed in the reconstituted formulation. The reconstituted formulation is suitable for administration (e.g. \n\n parenteral administration) to a patient to be treated with the anti-ICAM- 1 antibody and, in certain embodiments of the invention, may be one which is suitable for intravenous administration. \n\n\n The \"diluent\" of interest herein is one which is pharmaceutically acceptable (safe and non-toxic for administration to a human) and is useful for the preparation of a liquid formulation, such as a formulation reconstituted after lyophilization. In some embodiments, diluents include, but are not limited to, sterile water, bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), a pH buffered solution (e.g. phosphate-buffered saline), sterile saline solution, Ringer's solution or dextrose solution. In an alternative embodiment, diluents can include aqueous solutions of salts and/or buffers. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, a formulation of the invention is a lyophilized formulation comprising an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody of the invention, wherein at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% of said antibody may be recovered from a vial upon shaking said vial for 4 hours at a speed of 400 shakes per minute wherein said vial is filled to half of its volume with said formulation. In another embodiment, a formulation of the invention is a lyophilized formulation comprising an anti- ICAM- 1 antibody of the invention, wherein at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% of said antibody may be recovered from a vial upon subjecting the formulation to three freeze/thaw cycles wherein said vial is filled to half of its volume with said formulation.

In one embodiment, a lyophilized formulation of the invention comprises anti-ICAM- 1 antibody molecules of the invention, wherein at least about 90% , at least about 95%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% of said antibody is recovered by reconstituting said lyophilized formulation upon storage at \n\n about 40 °C for at least about 1 month, at least about 2 months, at least about 3 months, at least about 4 months, at least about 5 months, or at least about 6 months. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, a lyophilized formulation of the invention comprises anti- ICAM- 1 antibody molecules of the invention, wherein at least about 90% , at least about 95%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% of said antibody is recovered by reconstituting said lyophilized formulation upon storage at about 5 °C for at least about 1 month, at least about 2 months, at least about 3 months, at least about 4 months, at least about 5 months, at least about 6 months, at least about 7 months, at least about 8 months, at least about 9 months, at least about 10 months, at least about 11 months, or at least about 12 months. In one embodiment, a lyophilized formulation of the invention comprises anti-ICAM-1 antibody molecules of the invention, wherein at least about 90% , at least about 95%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% of said antibody is recovered by reconstituting said lyophilized formulation upon storage at about 5 °C for at least about 1 year, at least about 2 years, at least about 3 years, at least about 4 years, or at least about 5 years. \n\n\n In one embodiment, a reconstituted liquid formulation of the invention comprises an anti-ICAM-1 antibody of the invention at the same concentration as the pre-lyophilized liquid formulation. \n\n\n In one embodiment, a reconstituted liquid formulation of the invention comprises an anti-ICAM-1 antibody of the invention at a higher concentration than the pre-lyophilized liquid formulation. In specific embodiments, a reconstituted liquid formulation of the invention comprises about 2 fold, about 3 fold, about 4 fold, about 5 fold, about 6 fold, about 7 fold, about 8 fold, about 9 fold, about 10 fold, about 15 fold, about 20 fold, about 30 fold, about 40 fold higher concentration of an anti-ICAM-1 antibody of the invention than the pre- lyophilized liquid formulation. \n\n\n In another embodiment, alternatively a reconstituted liquid formulation of the invention comprises an anti-ICAM-1 antibody of the invention at a lower concentration than the pre-lyophilized liquid formulation. In specific embodiments, a reconstituted liquid formulation of the invention comprises about 2 fold, about 3 fold, about 4 fold, about 5 fold, about 6 fold, about 7 fold, about 8 fold, about 9 fold, about 10 fold, about 15 fold, about 20 fold, about 30 fold, about 40 fold lower concentration of an anti-ICAM-1 antibody of the invention than the pre-lyophilized liquid formulation. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, reconstituted formulations of the invention comprise (or consists of as the aggregate fraction) a particle profile of less than about 3.4 E +5 particles/ml \n\n of diameter 2-4 μιη, less than about 4.0 E +4 particles/ml of diameter 4-10 μιη, less than about 4.2 E +3 particles/ml of diameter 10-20 μιη, less than about 5.0 E +2 particles/ml of diameter 20-30 μιιι, less than about 7.5 E +1 particles/ml of diameter 30-40 μιη, and less than about 9.4 particles/ml of diameter 40-60 μιη as determined by a particle multisizer.

In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention is stable at 4 °C. In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention is stable at room temperature. \n\n\n The terms \"stability\" and \"stable\" as used herein in the context of a formulation comprising an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody of the invention refer to the resistance of the antibody in the formulation to aggregation, degradation or fragmentation under given manufacture, preparation, transportation and storage conditions. The \"stable\" formulations of the invention retain biological activity under given manufacture, preparation, transportation and storage conditions. The stability of the anti-ICAM- 1 antibody can be assessed by degrees of aggregation, degradation or fragmentation, as measured by HPSEC, static light scattering (SLS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), circular dichroism (CD), urea unfolding techniques, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, differential scanning calorimetry, and/or ANS binding techniques, compared to a reference formulation. For example, a reference formulation may be a reference standard frozen at -70°C consisting of 10 mg/ml of an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody of the invention in PBS. \n\n\n In specific embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions include, but are not limited to: \n\n (a) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody, 25 mM histidine, 1.6 mM glycine at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (b) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody and 25 mM \n\n\n histidine-HCl at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (c) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 25mg/ml of antibody, 20mM Citric acid, 100 mM NaCl, 1.5% mannitol, 50μ1 DTPA, and 0.02% Polysorbate 80 at pH 6.0;\n\n\n(d) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody, 25 mM histidine, 8% trehalose, and 0.02% Polysorbate 80 at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (e) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 20 mg/ml of antibody, 10 mM Histidine, 2.35 % (w/v) Lysine-HCl, and 0.02 % Polysorbate 80 (w/v) at pH 6.0;\n\n\n(f) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 5 mg/ml of antibody, lOmM Sodium \n\n\n citrate buffer, NaCl (0.15M) and Tween 80 (0.02%) at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (g) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody, 10 mM histidine and 150 mM NaCl at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (h) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody, 25 mM histidine, 1.6 mM glycine, 3% mannitol at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (i) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 10 mg/ml or 100 mg/ml of antibody, 10 mM histidine-HCl, 105 mM NaCl, 0.005% polysorbate 80 at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (j) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody, 10 mM histidine- HCl, 0.005% polysorbate 80 at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (k) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody, 6% trehalose, 2% arginine, 0.025% polysorbate, 10m M histidine at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (1) a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody, 20 mM citric acid,\n\n\n200 mM lysine, 15% trehalose, 0.1% polysorbate 80 at pH 6.0; \n\n\n (m)a sterile liquid formulation comprising 100 mg/ml of antibody, 20 mM citric acid,\n\n\n199 mM NaCl, 1.5% mannitol, 50μ1 DTPA, 0.02% polysorbate 80 at pH 6.0 The liquid formulations of the present invention exhibit stability at the temperature ranges of 38 °C to 42 °C for at least 60 days and, in some embodiments, not more than 120 days, of 20 °C to 24 °C for at least 1 year, of 2 °C to 8 °C (in particular, at 4 °C) for at least 3 years, at least 4 years, or at least 5 years and at -20 °C for at least 3 years, at least 4 years, or at least 5 years, as assessed by high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). Namely, the liquid formulations of the present invention have low to undetectable levels of aggregation and/or fragmentation, as defined herein, after the storage for the defined periods \n\n as set forth above. Preferably, no more than 5%, no more than 4%, no more than 3%, no more than 2%, no more than 1%, and most preferably no more than 0.5%, of anti-ICAM- 1 antibody forms an aggregate as measured by HPSEC, after the storage for the defined periods as set forth above. Furthermore, liquid formulations of the present invention exhibit almost no loss in biological activity(ies) of anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies during the prolonged storage under the condition described above, as assessed by various immunological assays including, for example, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and radioimmunoassay to measure the ICAM-1 antigen-binding ability of anti-ICAM- 1 antibody. The liquid formulations of the present invention retain after the storage for the above-defined periods more than 80%, more than 85%, more than 90%, more than 95%, more than 98%, more than 99%, or more than 99.5% of the initial biological activity(ies) prior to the storage. \n\n\n Therapeutic compositions of the present invention may be formulated for a particular dosage. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the anti-ICAM- 1 antibody and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an anti-ICAM- 1 antibody for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals. \n\n\n Therapeutic compositions of the present invention can be formulated for particular routes of administration, such as oral, nasal, pulmonary, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal and/or parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the subject being treated, and the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the composition which produces a therapeutic effect. By way of example, in \n\n certain embodiments, the antibodies (including antibody fragments) are formulated for intravenous administration. In certain other embodiments, the antibodies (including antibody fragments) are formulated for nasal or pulmonary delivery. \n\n\n Formulations of the present invention which are suitable for topical or transdermal administration include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required (US Patent No. 7,378,110; 7,258,873; 7,135,180; US Publication No. 2004- 0042972; and 2004-0042971). \n\n\n The phrases \"parenteral administration\" and \"administered parenterally\" as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural and intrasternal injection and infusion. \n\n\n Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of the particular compositions of the present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compositions employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, antibodies of the invention can be formulated to ensure proper distribution in vivo. For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) excludes many highly hydrophilic compounds. To ensure that the therapeutic compounds of the invention can cross the BBB (if desired), they can be formulated, for example, in liposomes. For methods of manufacturing liposomes, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,522,811; 5,374,548; \n\n\n5,399,331. The liposomes may comprise one or more moieties which are selectively transported into specific cells or organs, thus enhance targeted drug delivery (see, e.g., V. V. Ranade (1989) /. Clin. Pharmacol. 29:685). Exemplary targeting moieties include folate or \n\n biotin (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,016); mannosides (Umezawa et al., (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 153: 1038); antibodies (P. G. Bloeman et al. (1995) FEBS Lett. \n\n\n357: 140; M. Owais et al. (1995) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39: 180); surfactant protein A receptor (Briscoe et al. (1995) Am. J. Physiol. 1233: 134), different species of which may comprise the formulations of the inventions, as well as components of the invented molecules; pl20 (Schreier et al. (1994) . Biol. Chem. 269:9090); see also K. Keinanen; M. L. Laukkanen (1994) FEBS Lett. 346: 123; J. J. Killion; I. J. Fidler (1994) Immunomethods 4:273. In one embodiment of the invention, the therapeutic compounds of the invention are formulated in liposomes; in another embodiment, the liposomes include a targeting moiety. In another embodiment, the therapeutic compounds in the liposomes are delivered by bolus injection to a site proximal to the desired area, e.g., the site of inflammation or infection, or the site of a tumor. When administered in this manner, the composition must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and may be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the therapeutic antibody compositions may be administered with medical devices known in the art. For example, in one embodiment, a therapeutic composition of the invention can be administered with a needleless hypodermic injection device, such as the devices disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,399,163; 5,383,851; 5,312,335; 5,064,413; 4,941,880; 4,790,824; 4,596,556. Examples of well-known implants and modules useful in the present invention include: U.S. Pat. No. 4,487,603, which discloses an implantable micro-infusion pump for dispensing medication at a controlled rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,486,194, which discloses a therapeutic device for administering medicants through the skin; U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,233, which discloses a medication infusion pump for delivering medication at a precise infusion rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,224, which discloses a variable flow implantable infusion apparatus for continuous drug delivery; U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,196, which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system having multi-chamber compartments; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,475,196, which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system. Many other such implants, delivery systems, and modules are known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\n The efficient dosages and the dosage regimens for the antibodies of the invention depend on the disease or condition to be treated and can be determined by the persons skilled in the art. \n\n\n A \"therapeutically effective dosage\" for preventing HRV infection may reduce the number and/or severity of HRV infections. A \"therapeutically effective dosage\" for treating \n\n HRV infection may result in reduced duration and/or severity of HRV infections. Likewise, a \"therapeutically effective dosage\" for preventing CV-A infection may reduce the number and/or severity of CV-A infections and a \"therapeutically effective dosage\" for treating CV-A infection may result in reduced duration and/or severity of CV-A infections. Similarly, a \"therapeutically effective dosage\" for preventing/inhibiting adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes to the vascular endothelium may reduce the number and/or severity and/or duration and/or severity of Plasmodium falciparum infections. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to determine such amounts based on such factors as the subject's size, the severity of the subject's symptoms, and the particular composition or route of administration selected. \n\n\n (viii) Articles of Manufacture and Kits \n\n\n This section of the specification describes various exemplary kits and packages comprising anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies (including antibody fragments) of the present disclosure. It should be understood that any of the anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies and antibody fragments described herein, including antibodies and antibody fragments having any one or more of the structural and functional features described in detail throughout the application, may be packaged, sold, and/or used as part of a kit or package, as described in this section.

In particular, the invention provides a method for detecting the interaction of a live virus with at least one host cell polypeptide by Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF®). Such methods may be used for example to identify molecules which inhibit the interaction of a live virus with at least one host cell polypeptide. The methods provided herein satisfy a number of \n\n\nrequirements, such as specificity of the binding interactions detected; sensitivity of the assay even when the affinity of the live virus for the host cell polypeptide is low; use of live unlabeled virus; reproducibility of the method and enablement of a high throughput screening of candidate inhibitor molecules. \n\n\n The invention provides a method for detecting the interaction of a live virus with a host cell polypeptide by Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence technique, the method comprising the steps of: \n\n\n a) providing a buffer solution containing a first protein comprising a host cell polypeptide which is labeled with a first fluorescent marker and a second protein comprising a host cell polypeptide which is labeled with a second fluorescent marker, wherein the first fluorescent marker is the first partner or the second partner of paired FRET fluorescence markers and the second fluorescent marker is the second partner or the first partner of paired FRET fluorescence markers; \n\n\n b) adding a live virus to the solution obtained in step a); \n\n\n c) submitting the mixture obtained at step b) to a source of energy at a wavelength corresponding to the excitation wavelength of the first partner of paired FRET fluorescence markers; and \n\n\n d) measuring the fluorescence signal at the emission wavelength of the second partner of paired FRET fluorescence markers. \n\n\n The invention further provides a method for the screening of a candidate molecule which has the ability of inhibiting the interaction of a live virus with a host cell polypeptide by Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence, the method comprising the steps of: \n\n a) providing a buffer solution containing a first protein comprising a host cell polypeptide which is labeled with a first fluorescent marker and a second protein comprising a host cell polypeptide which is labeled with a second fluorescent marker, wherein the first fluorescent marker is the first partner or the second partner of paired FRET fluorescence markers and the second fluorescent marker is the second partner or the first partner of paired FRET fluorescence markers; \n\n\n b) adding the candidate molecule to the solution obtained in step a); c) adding a live virus to the solution obtained in step b); \n\n\n d) submitting the mixture obtained at step c) to a source of energy at a wavelength corresponding to the excitation wavelength of the first partner of paired FRET fluorescence markers; \n\n\n e) measuring the fluorescence signal at the emission wavelength of the second partner of paired FRET fluorescence markers; and \n\n\n f) comparing the fluorescence signal value obtained at step e) with the fluorescence signal value obtained when step b) is omitted to determine if the candidate compound inhibits the interaction between the first and/or second host cell protein and the live virus. \n\n\n The invention further provides a method for the screening of a candidate molecule which has the ability of inhibiting the interaction of a live virus with a host cell polypeptide by Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence, the method comprising the steps of: \n\n\n a) providing a buffer solution containing a first protein comprising a host cell polypeptide which is labeled with a first fluorescent marker and a second protein comprising a host cell polypeptide which is labeled with a second fluorescent marker, wherein the first fluorescent marker is the first partner or the second partner of paired FRET fluorescence markers and the second fluorescent marker is the second partner or the first partner of paired FRET fluorescence markers; \n\n\n b) adding a live virus to the solution obtained in step a); \n\n\n c) adding the candidate molecule to the solution obtained in step b); d) submitting the mixture obtained at step c) to a source of energy at a wavelength corresponding to the excitation wavelength of the first partner of paired FRET fluorescence markers; \n\n e) measuring the fluorescence signal at the emission wavelength of the second partner of paired FRET fluorescence markers; and \n\n\n f) comparing the fluorescence signal value obtained at step e) with the fluorescence signal value obtained when step c) is omitted to determine if the candidate compound inhibits the interaction between the first and/or second host cell protein and the live virus. \n\n\n According to the methods of the invention, each of the first and a second protein comprising host cell polypeptides is labeled with a fluorescent marker consisting of a donor molecule (i.e. the first partner of a paired FRET fluorescence markers) or an acceptor molecule (i.e., the second partner of paired FRET fluorescence markers). Thus, when the first fluorescent marker labeling the first protein is the donor molecule (i.e., the first partner of paired FRET fluorescence markers), the second fluorescent marker labeling the second protein is the acceptor molecule (i.e., the second partner of the paired FRET fluorescence markers). Conversely, when the first fluorescent marker labeling the first protein is the acceptor molecule (i.e., the second partner of paired FRET fluorescence markers), the second fluorescent marker labeling the second protein is the donor molecule (i.e., the first partner of the paired FRET fluorescence markers). \n\n\n In one embodiment, the first fluorescent marker is the first partner and the second fluorescent marker is the second partner of paired FRET fluorescent markers. In another embodiment, the first fluorescent marker is the second partner and the second fluorescent marker is the first partner of paired FRET fluorescent markers. Every paired FRET fluorescence markers known in the art may be used for performing the screening method of the invention. The choice of appropriate excitation wavelength of the first partner and wavelength to be measured for emission of the second partner is considered to be within the level of skill in the art. In a specific embodiment, the first partner of paired FRET fluorescent markers is cyan fluorescent protein and the second partner of paired FRET fluorescent markers is yellow fluorescent protein. In a specific embodiment, the first partner of paired FRET fluorescent markers is Europium cryptate and the second partner of paired FRET fluorescent markers is XL665. In the specific embodiment wherein the paired FRET fluorescent markers are respectively Europium cryptate and XL665, the source of energy is at a wavelength of between 320-337 nm, which is the excitation wavelength of Europium cryptate and the fluorescence signal is measured at 665nm, which is the emission wavelength of XL665. In certain embodiments, the fluorescence signal of the europium cryptate donor is also measured at 620 nm. \n\n It is specifically contemplated that the first and second proteins may be directly or indirectly labeled. In one embodiment, both the first and the second protein are directly labeled. In another embodiment, both the first and the second protein are indirectly labeled. In still another embodiment, the first protein is directly labeled and the second protein is indirectly labeled. In yet another embodiment, the first protein is indirectly labeled and the second protein is directly labeled. It is specifically contemplated that a protein may be directly labeled, wherein the fluorescent marker is covalently bound directly to the protein. It is further contemplated that a protein may be directly labeled wherein the protein further comprises the amino acid sequence of a fluorescent protein, for example as a fusion protein. It is further contemplated that a protein may be indirectly labeled, wherein the protein further comprises a detectable molecule (e.g. a peptide tag such as a FLAG tag) that is recognized by a labeling reagent having specific affinity for the detectable molecule, wherein the labeling reagent (e.g., an antibody that binds the peptide tag such as an anti-FLAG antibody) comprises the fluorescent marker. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the first and the second proteins comprise host cell polypeptides having different amino acid sequences. In one embodiment, the different amino acid sequences are amino acid sequences of different host cell proteins. In another embodiment, the different amino acid sequences are sequences of the same host cell protein. It is specifically contemplated that the different amino acid sequences of the same host cell protein may be over lapping or non-overlapping amino acid sequences. In other \n\n\nembodiments, the first and second proteins comprise the same host cell polypeptide. In certain embodiments, the first and/or second protein consists essentially of a host cell polypeptide which may be the same or different host cell polypeptide as described herein. Any host cell polypeptide which interacts with a live virus may be utilized in the instant methods. For example, but not by way of limitation, polypeptides of an extracellular host cell protein that is a receptor for a live virus may be utilized in the instant methods. In a specific embodiment, the of the host cell polypeptides are ICAM-1 polypeptides, in particular human ICAM-1. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the live virus is an attenuated virus. In certain embodiments, the live virus is a wild type virus. It is contemplated that the live virus may be in a crude preparation or may be purified away from one or more contaminates. In one embodiment, the live virus is a human rhinovirus (HRV). In a specific embodiment, the live virus is HRV- 16. In another embodiment, the live virus is a cocksackie virus. In a specific embodiment, the live virus is CV-A21 or CV-A16. \n\n Any candidate molecule may be screened for the ability to inhibit the interaction of a live virus with a host cell polypeptide by the methods of the invention. In certain \n\n\nembodiments, the candidate molecule is a small molecule, in particular compounds having molecular mass of less than 3000 Daltons, preferably less than 2000 or 1500, more preferably less than 1000, and still more preferably less than 600 Daltons.

It will be understood by one of skill in the art that the duration of the incubation will be of sufficient duration for the binding/inhibition of binding while short enough to minimize degradation/inactivation of the reagents. It will also be understood by one of skill in the art that an incubation step is performed at a temperature which allows for the binding/inhibition of binding while minimizing degradation/inactivation of the reagents. In some embodiments the mixture is incubated after the addition of the live virus but prior to submitting the mixture to a source of energy. In other embodiments the mixture is incubated after step a) but prior to the addition of the live virus. In certain embodiments, the mixture is incubated after step a) but prior to the addition of the live virus, and the mixture is incubated again after the addition of the live virus but prior to submitting the mixture to a source of energy.

Specific embodiments are further provided and exemplified in Assay 1 provided in Example 11, infra. \n\n 8. EXAMPLES \n\n\n The examples below are given so as to illustrate the practice of this invention. They are not intended to limit or define the entire scope of this invention. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 1 - Isolation and identification of anti-ICAM- 1 scFv antibodies \n\n\nScFv antibody repertoire \n\n\n A large single chain Fv (scFv) human antibody library derived from bone marrow from adult naive donors and cloned into a phagemid vector based on filamentous phage Ml 3 was used for selections (1). \n\n\nSelection of scFv's: \n\n\n ICAM-1 -specific scFv antibodies were isolated from the phage display library in a series of repeated selection cycles on recombinant mammalian expressed human ICAM-1 (R&D Systems) essentially as previously described (2). While several antigen-specific scFv's were obtained from different variations of this protocol, the parental clones ICM10064 and ICM10088 were isolated as follows: 10 μ^Ώίύ human ICAM-1 was immobilised on MAXISORP™ plates (Nunc) and incubated with the phage display library. Unbound phage was washed away in a series of wash cycles. The phage particles retained on the antigen were eluted, infected into bacteria and rescued for the next round of selection. Two rounds of selection were performed in this way. A representative number of individual clones from the round 2 selection output were grown up in 96-well plates. ScFv's were expressed in the bacterial periplasm and screened for their inhibitory activity in both a human ICAM-1 :HRV binding assay, and a human ICAM-1 :LFA-1 binding assay (see Assays 1 and 2, respectively below). \n\n\n Screening hits, i.e. scFv clones which showed an inhibitory effect on ICAM-1 :HRV- 16 interaction, but not ICAM-1 :LFA-1 interaction, as crude periplasmic extracts, were subjected to DNA sequencing (2, 3). Unique scFv's were expressed again in bacteria and purified by affinity chromatography (as described in Example 3 of WOO 1/66754), and IC\n50\n values were determined by testing dilution series of purified scFv' s in the above assays. To this end, raw data was first converted to % HRV- 16-binding values as outlined previously before using Prism curve fitting software (GRAPHPAD™) to determine IC\n50\n values. \n\n The most potent scFv clones were converted to whole immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) antibody format essentially as described by Persic et al (4) with the following modifications. An OriP fragment was included in the expression vectors to facilitate use with EBNA- HEK293 cells and to allow episomal replication. The VH domain was cloned into a vector (pEU9.2) containing the human heavy chain constant domains and regulatory elements to express whole IgG2 heavy chain in mammalian cells. Similarly, the VL domain was cloned into a vector (pEU4.4) for the expression of the human light chain (lambda) constant domains and regulatory elements to express whole IgG light chain in mammalian cells. To obtain IgGs, the heavy and light chain IgG expressing vectors were transfected into EBNA-HEK293 mammalian cells. IgGs were expressed and secreted into the medium. Harvests were pooled and filtered prior to purification, then IgG was purified using Protein A chromatography. Culture supernatants were loaded on a column of appropriate size of Ceramic Protein A (BioSepra) and washed with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl. Bound IgG was eluted from the column using 0.1 M Sodium Citrate (pH 3.0) and neutralised by the addition of Tris- HC1 (pH 9.0). The eluted material was buffer exchanged into PBS using NaplO columns (Amersham, #17-0854-02) and the concentration of IgG was determined \n\n\nspectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient based on the amino acid sequence of the IgG (5). The purified IgG were analysed for aggregation and degradation using SEC- HPLC and by SDS-PAGE. \n\n\n Several lead candidates were evaluated as IgGs in the HRV:ICAM-1 and LFA-\n\n\n1 :ICAM-1 binding assays described above. As shown in Figures 1A and IB, Clones ICM 10098 and 103, as well as the commercial mouse anti human ICAM-1 antibody designated 15.2, show at least partial inhibition of HRV: ICAM-1 binding and full inhibition of LFA- 1 :ICAM- 1 binding. In contrast clones ICM10064 and 88 completely inhibit HRV binding and have minimal inhibitory activity on LFA- 1 :IC AM- 1 binding. \n\n\nReferences referred to in Example 1. \n\n\n (1) Hutchings, C, Generation of Naive Human Antibody Libraries, in Antibody Engineering, R.

This procedure was based on assays reported by Charles et al (1), inhibition was achieved when an intact monolayer remained which was quantified (refer to Assay 3 below). In this assay a number of isolated clones including ICM10064, ICM10088, ICM10098, ICM10103, and several commercially available mouse anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies (14C11, R&D Systems and 8.4A6, Abeam) were tested for their ability to block HRV- 16 and/or HRV- 14 infection. In addition, an antibody designated hlA2 IgG2, comprising a variable region based on the humanized anti-ICAM- 1 1A2 scFv HscB described in Luo et al. (3) and patent WO2003035696, was also tested. Representative plots are shown in Figures 2A and 2B for HRV-16 and HRV-14 infection, respectively (data for 8.4A6 not shown in figure). The results from these studies are summarised in Table 2. \n\n\n These studies show that both ICM10064 and ICM10088 inhibited HRV-16 infection in the CPE cell based assay. All raw data values were converted to percent inhibition and Prism curve fitting software (GRAPHPAD™) was used to determine IC\n50\n values. ICM 10064 had an IC\n50\n value of 1.32 nM (n=6), ICM10088 did not always form a complete curve but the percent inhibition was 79.5 % (n=6). The same assay was used to test the efficacy of ICM10064 and ICM10088 against HRV 14 inhibition. IC\n50\n values of 0.65 nM (n=5) and 2.3 nM (n=4) were achieved respectively. This data suggests ICM10064 and ICM10088 inhibit, at least, two different human rhinovirus serotypes in a cell based assay. \n\n\n ICAM-1 has a lymphocyte function associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) binding site involved in T-cell trafficking and migration. Several ICAM-1 antibodies including \n\n\nICM10064, ICM10088, ICM10098, ICM10103, several commercially available mouse anti- ICAM- 1 antibodies (14C11, 15.2, 8.4A6, and RRl/1) and hlA2 IgG2 were assessed for their ability to block functioning of the LFA-1 binding site using a Jurkat adhesion assay adapted from Cherry et al (2). Briefly, 96 well plates were coated with ICAM-1 -Fc to capture human Jurkat cells. If the antibodies bound to the LFA-1 binding site then cells would not adhere to the ICAM-1 -Fc and hence be washed away during the assay (see Assay 4 below for further detail). Representative plots are shown in Figure 3. In Table 2 the data is summarised. Although inhibition was not always detected, the maximum inhibition observed at 300 nM for ICM10064 was between 0-11 % and for ICM10088 was between 0-24 %. This data suggests there is minimal interference of the LFA-1 binding site with these IgGs. In contrast, \n\n ICM10098, ICM10103, hlA2 and all the commercial antibodies except 14C11 showed significant inhibition (data for 8.4A6, and RRl/1 not shown). \n\n\n These results demonstrate the specific HRV blocking activity of ICM 10064 and ICM10088 over LFA-l. \n\n\nReferences referred to in Example 2: \n\n\n (1) Charles, C.H., Luo, G.X., Kohlstaedt, L.A., Moranette, I.G., Gorfain, E., Cao, L., Williams, J.H. and Fang, F.

This panel included the ICAM-1 Kilifi mutant (K56M) - a naturally occurring ICAM-1 domain 1 polymorphism present in certain African populations (1). Additionally, a chimaeric human ICAM-1 domain 1 / mouse ICAM-1 domains 2-5 molecule was included in the panel to determine domain specificity of the selected anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies. \n\n\n As shown in Figure 4A, ICM10064 and ICM10088 bind only to human ICAM-1 (R&D Systems), human ICAM-1 Kilifi and the human domain 1 ICAM-1 chimaeric molecule (both Medlmmune / AstraZeneca generated). There is no binding detected to mouse or cynomolgus monkey ICAM-1 variants (R&D Systems and Medlmmune respectively), or human ICAM-1 related molecules ICAM-2, ICAM-3, ICAM-5 or VCAM-1 (all R&D Systems). \n\n\n The results demonstrate the specificity of our selected antibodies for human IC AM- 1 domain 1 , which has been shown to be involved in human rhinovirus (HRV) attachment to this molecule. The lack of antibody cross-reactivity to either mouse or cynomolgus monkey ICAM-1 variants is not surprising given the low homology across key HRV-binding loops in domain 1 between these species (63% and 45% homology to human loop BC for cynomolgus monkey and mouse respectively), and the specificity both ICM10064 and ICM10088 have for \n\n inhibiting HRV attachment. Additionally, HRV is unable to bind either mouse or cynomolgus monkey ICAM-1 molecules. \n\n\n We selected both ICM10064 and ICM10088 as our lead antibodies because of their ability to specifically inhibit HRV attachment to human ICAM-1 domain 1, while not inhibiting the ability of IC AM- 1 to recruit neutrophils via its interaction with LFA- 1\n\n\n(Example 2). The schematic shown in Figure 5 summarizes the various characteristics of several of the antibodies analyzed in the above assays and indicates the likely location of the epitopes based on the binding and functional characteristics observed. \n\n\n Potency and affinity optimisation of these lead candidates is described in subsequent examples. The complete sequence of the variable regions of ICM10064 and ICM10088 is shown in Figures 6A-B and 7A-B, respectively. The SEQ ID NOs of the variable region sequences, framework region sequences and CDR sequences of these antibodies are shown in Table 8. \n\n\n References for Example 3: \n\n\n(1) Fernandez-Reyes, D., et al.

Genet. 2000. 6: p. 1357 \n\n\nEXAMPLE 4 - Germlining and stability engineering anti-ICAM-1 antibodies as IgGl TM\n\n\nICM 10064 was initially converted to IgG2 format (Example 1) as effector function is not required. However, an alternate effector-null isotype, IgGl TM (IgGl Fc sequence incorporating mutations L234F, L235E and P331S) was chosen as the final format for the affinity optimised variants from this lineage. Therefore, ICM 10064 VH nucleotide sequence was sub-cloned from the IgG2 pEU9.2 vector into IgGl TM pEU1.4 vector, essentially as described previously (Example 1). Germlining of the parental sequence was performed on the VH and VL sequences separately. The amino acid sequence of ICM 10064 VH and VL were aligned to the known human germline sequences in the VBASE database (1) and the closest germline was identified by sequence similarity. For the VH domain this was VH4-b (DP-67), for the VL domain it was Vlambdal-c (DPL-2). There were 2 changes in the framework of the VH domain and 5 in the VL domain, all of which were reverted to the closest germline sequence by standard molecular biology. Only the Vernier residues (2) were left unchanged. Additionally, a light chain Al IV mutatagenesis (Kabat numbering) was performed to remove an O-glycosylation consensus sequence at this position. The resultant ICM 10064 variant was named ICM10064fgl and was tested for potency in the HeLa-OHIO CPE assay and affinity by BIACORE™ as described in later examples. An alignment of the heavy and light chain amino acid sequences for ICM10064 and ICM10064fgl is provided in \n\n Figures 9A-B . This work was done in parallel to the optimisation work on this lineage described in Examples 5 and 6 below, such that, at the end of the optimisation phase, sequence changes incorporated into ICM10064 had been demonstrated not to adversely impact potency or affinity of the parent antibody. Similarly, germlining of ICM10088 in an IgGl TM format was also performed. The closest germline was identified as VH1-18 (DP- 14) and Vlambdal-c (DPL-2) for VH and VL sequences respectively. There were 5 changes in both VH and VL sequences reverted to the closest germline sequence by standard molecular biology techniques, again leaving the Vernier residues (2) unchanged. \n\n\nAdditionally, a heavy chain N54S mutation and light chain Al IV mutation (Kabat numbering) were incorporated to remove a potential deamidation site and (9-glycosylation consensus sequence at these positions respectively. The resultant ICM 10088 variant is called ICM10088fgl. An alignment of the heavy and light chain amino acid sequences for ICM10088 and ICM10088fgl is provided in Figures 7A-B. \n\n\nReferences for Example 4: \n\n\n(1) Tomlinson, I., VBASE. 1997, MRC Centre of Protein Engineering, Cambridge, UK.

The libraries were subjected to affinity-based phage display selections in order to select variants with a higher affinity to human ICAM-1 Fc. In consequence, these were expected to show an improved inhibitory activity for HRV binding to ICAM-1. The selections were performed essentially as described previously (2). In brief, the scFv-phage particles were incubated with recombinant biotinylated human IC AM- 1 Fc in solution (R&D Systems, biotinylated via free amines using EZ LINK™ Sulfo-NHS-LC- Biotin (Thermo/Pierce, product: 21335)). ScFv bound to antigen were then captured on streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (DYNABEADS® M-280) following manufacturer's recommendations. The selected scFv-phage particles were then rescued as described previously (3), and the selection process was repeated in the presence of decreasing \n\n concentrations of biotinylated human ICAM-1 (a typical example would be 50 nM to 20 pM over five rounds). \n\n\n Crude scFv-containing periplasmic extracts were prepared of a representative number of individual scFv's from the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) CDR3-targetted selection outputs and screened in an epitope competition HTRF® (Homogeneous Time- Resolved Fluorescence) assay format against their respective parent antibody (see Assay 6 below). Screen hits, i.e. scFv variants which showed a significantly improved inhibitory effect when compared to their respective parent scFv, were subjected to DNA sequencing, and unique variants from variable heavy and variable light library outputs were produced as purified scFv for further characterisation. Some scFv's were then selected and converted to IgGl TM and tested again in an effort to realise additional potency gain. No variable heavy (VH) CDR3 -randomised ICM10064 scFv's were selected by this strategy, however improved ICM10088 variants randomised in both variable heavy (VL) and variable light (VL) CDR3 sequences were obtained. \n\n\nFor the ICM 10088 lineage only, the separate VH and VL CDR3 -randomised selection outputs comprising of large numbers of scFv variants with the ability to inhibit in the binding of parental IgG to human ICAM- 1 were recombined to form a single library in phage display format in which clones contained randomly paired individually randomised VH and VL CDR3 sequences. Phage selections were then continued as described previously in the presence of decreasing concentrations of biotinylated human ICAM-1 Fc (100 pM to 1 pM over a further four rounds). \n\n\n Crude scFv-containing periplasmic extracts were prepared of a representative number of individual scFv's from the recombined variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) selection outputs and screened in the epitope competition HTRF® assay against ICM10088 antibody. Screen hits, i.e. scFv variants which showed a significantly improved inhibitory effect when compared to parent scFv and leads generated pre-recombination, were subjected to DNA sequencing, and unique recombined variants were produced as purified scFv for further characterisation. The most active scFv's were then selected and converted to IgGl TM and tested again in an effort to realise additional potency gain. \n\n\n Alignments of the amino acid sequences of the CDR3 randomized light chains for the selected antibodies from the ICM 10064 and ICM 10088 lineages (constituting antibody Panels 1A and IB, respectively) are shown in Figures 6 and 7B. Alignments of the amino acid sequence of the CDR randomized heavy chains for the selected antibodies from the \n\n ICM10088 lineage are shown in Figure 7A, the heavy chains for the selected antibodies from the ICM10064 lineage were identical to the parent heavy chain (see Figure 8A). \n\n\nReferences for Example 5: \n\n\n (1) Clackson, T. and Lowman, H.B.

The conditions for this error-prone PCR (EP) were chosen to introduce on average 8.1 nucleotide changes per 1000 basepairs (according to the manufacturer). A representative proportion of the produced variant population was used as a template for a second round of error-prone PCR, using the same conditions, for further diversification. The resulting population of randomly mutated ICM 10064 scFv's was then converted to ribosome display format and used in affinity-based ribosome display selections (2). On the DNA level, a T7 promoter was added at the 5'-end for efficient transcription to mRNA. On the mRNA level, the construct contained a prokaryotic ribo some-binding site (Shine-Dalgarno sequence). At the 3 '-end of the single chain, the stop codon was removed and a portion of M13 \n\n\nbacteriophage gill (gene III) was added to act as a spacer between the nascent scFv polypeptide and the ribosome (2). \n\n\n The scFv's were expressed in vitro using the RIBOMAX™ Large Scale RNA \n\n\nProduction System (T7) (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol and an E.coli- based prokaryotic cell-free translation system. The produced scFv antibody-ribosome- mRNA (ARM) complexes were incubated in solution with biotinylated human IC AM- 1 Fc (R&D Systems, biotinylated via free amines using EZ LINK™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Thermo/Pierce, product: 21335)). The specifically bound tertiary complexes (ICAM- 1:ARM) were captured on streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (DYNABEADS® M-280) \n\n following the manufacturer's recommendations (Dynal) whilst unbound ARMs were washed away. The mRNA encoding the bound scFv's were then recovered by reverse transcription- PCR (RT-PCR). The selection process was repeated on the obtained population for further rounds of selections with decreasing concentrations of biotinylated human ICAM- 1 (5 nM to 50 pM over 4 rounds), in order to enrich and thereby select clones with higher affinity for ICAM- 1. In consequence, these would show an improved inhibitory activity on IC AM- 1:HRV-16 binding and thus viral-blocking function. The outputs from selection rounds 3 and 4 were sub-cloned into pCantab6 (1) for bacterial expression as scFv's, and improved clones were identified as penplasmic extracts in an ICM 10064 epitope competition assay (described in Example 5). \n\n\n Lead sequences from the optimisation strategy described above were converted to IgGl TM format. Additionally, a VL chain N95aS (Kabat numbering) mutation was incorporated into lead antibody Icmo0070 IgGl TM by standard molecular biology techniques to remove a potential deamidation site at this position within the VL CDR3 sequence. The resultant Icmo0070 IgGl TM variant was named Icmo0070SGR IgGl TM. IgGl TM format leads from this initial strategy were tested for potency in the HeLa-OHIO CPE assay and affinity by BIACORE™ as described in later examples (see also Tables 1 and 2). \n\n\n A second-generation ribosome display library was constructed by pooling the top 5 scFv variants (designated clones Icmo0069, 70, 72, 75 and 79) from the initial strategy and introducing further sequence diversity by error-prone PCR. The second generation ribosome display library was selected essentially as described above. Biotinylated human ICAM-1 Fc concentration was decreased from 50 pM to 1 pM over three rounds. Selection outputs from Rounds 2 and 3 were sub-cloned into pCantab6, and scFv-containing periplasmic extracts were screened in the ICM10064 epitope competition as described in Example 5. \n\n\n ScFv variants giving the greatest competition of ICM10064:ICAM-1 binding were again sequenced, and purified scFv's were prepared as in Example 1 for further \n\n\ncharacterisation. The most potent scFv's from this second generation ribosome display library were converted to IgGl TM format and were tested for potency in the HeLa-OHIO CPE and Jurkat adhesion assays and affinity by BIACORE™ as described in later examples (see also Tables 1 and 2). \n\n\n The antibodies isolated and subsequently engineered from the error-prone PCR libraries from ICM10064 constitute Panel 2 of optimised antibodies. Alignments of the amino acid sequences for the heavy and light chains of Panel 2 are shown in Figure 8 A-B . \n\n A panel of germlined antibody sequences from the second generation ribosome display library were created. The experiments described in Example 4 generated germlined parental (ICM10064fgl) VH and VL sequences. Differences were identified between ICM10064fgl and Icmo0183, 191 and 194 antibody CDR and Vernier sequences. These were added to the ICM10064fgl VH and VL back-bone using standard molecular biology techniques. Additionally, a VL chain N95aS (Kabat numbering) mutation was incorporated into each antibody sequence as described above for Icmo0070. The resultant engineered IgGl TM antibodies were named Icmo0183fgl, 191fgl and 194fgl. Alignments of the amino acid sequences for the heavy and light chains of the germlined/N95aS antibodies of the ICM0064 lineage are shown in Figure 9A-B. \n\n\nReferences for Example 6: \n\n\n (1) Hutchings, C, Generation of Naive Human Antibody Libraries, in Antibody Engineering, R.

The protocol was unchanged to that described in\n\n\nExample 2 (also see Assay 3 below). IgGs Icmo059, 60, 61, 66 and 68, from panel IB and Icmo069, 70, 72, 75, 79, 181, 183, 188, 189, 191, 70_SGR, 183fgl, 191fgl and 194 fgl from panel 2, were tested in the CPE assay. \n\n\n All IgGs were tested for their ability to block HRV- 16 or HRV- 14 and in some cases both serotypes. All optimised IgGs tested were able to inhibit a major group rhinovirus with IC\n50\n values ranging from 0.09-0.59 nM, as summarised in Table 2. Additionally, representative IgGs from Panel 2 were further tested for their ability to block major group rhinovirus serotypes HRV-14, HRV-16, HRV-41 and HRV-70, along with minor group rhinovirus serotypes HRV- lb and HRV-2 using a variation of the CPE assay that uses CELLTITER- GLO™ (Promega) as the final read-out for cell viability (all other CPE assay data described in these Examples uses Crystal Violet to quantify viable cells - see assay materials and methods). All IgGs tested were able to fully inhibit major rhinovirus serotypes, and were unable to inhibit minor rhinovirus serotypes as would be predicted for an anti- ICAM-1 antibody. Minor serotypes use the LDL receptor for viral entry. \n\n Representative IgGs from Panels IB and 2 were also tested for LFA-1 inhibition in the Jurkat adhesion assay. The protocol for this is unchanged to that described in Example 2. The data quotes the percentage inhibition achieved at 300 nM of antibody. Other than hlA2 IgG2 which had an IC\n50\n value of 0.56 nM no other IgG tested was able to fully inhibit LFA-1 at the top concentration tested (900 nM). \n\n\nEXAMPLE 8 - Inhibitory activity of optimised anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies on HRV infectivity in primary lung COPD epithelial cells \n\n\n Purified IgGs from panel 2 were tested for their ability to specifically inhibit HRV- 14 infection of human primary lung epithelial cells. This assay quantifies viral RNA levels 24 hours post infection as a measure of viral infection (as detailed in Assay 7 below). Results are expressed as a relative quantification of viral RNA in the presence of IgG compared to RNA levels in control samples. Data is summarised in Table 2. All antibodies tested were able to fully inhibit viral infection, with IC\n50\n values in the range of 70-150 pM. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 9 - Specificity of optimised anti- ICAM-1 antibodies to human ICAM-1 domain 1 and human ICAM-1 'Kilifi' mutant over a panel of human ICAM-1 related molecules and cynomolgus and mouse variants, as measured by IgG ELISA \n\n\n The specificity of the optimised anti-human ICAM-1 antibody molecules to various ICAM-1 species variants and other human ICAM-1 related molecules was assessed biochemically by an IgG binding ELISA (see Assay 5 below). As in Example 3, this panel included the ICAM-1 Kilifi mutant (1) and a chimaeric human ICAM-1 domain 1 / mouse ICAM-1 domains 2-5 molecule for epitope mapping. \n\n\n As shown in Figure 4B, Icmo0191fgl from Panel 2 for example binds only to human ICAM-1 (R&D Systems), human ICAM-1 Kilifi and the human domain 1 ICAM-1 chimaeric molecule (both Medlmmune / AstraZeneca generated). There is no binding detected to mouse or cynomolgus monkey ICAM-1 variants (R&D Systems and Medlmmune respectively), or human ICAM-1 related molecules ICAM-3, ICAM-5 or VCAM-1 (all R&D Systems). One antibody, Icmo0183, showed minimal binding to ICAM-2 (R&D Systems) at the highest concentration tested. All the others tested showed no binding to ICAM-2. \n\n\n In general, the results confirm the same specificity of all our optimised leads tested for human ICAM-1 domain 1, under the chosen assay conditions. \n\n\nReferences for Example 9: \n\n\n (1) Fernandez-Reyes, D., et al.

Genet. 1997. 6: p. 1357 \n\n EXAMPLE 10 - Affinity of Lead and Panel 1 and 2 anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies for human\n\n\nICAM-1 as determined by BIACORE™ and HeLa-OHIO binding assays \n\n\n The affinity of optimised anti-IC AM- 1 antibodies to human IC AM- 1 was confirmed by affinity determination. Surface plasmon resonance measurements using a BIACORE™ 2000 Biosensor (BIAcore AB) were performed essentially as described by Karlsson et al (1). In brief, Protein G was coupled to a CM5 sensorchip using an amine coupling kit (BIAcore) at a surface density of approximately 500 RU and used to capture sample antibodies (added at 0.5ug/ml). A serial dilution (between 300 nM and 4.69 nM) of human monomeric ICAM-1 (R&D Systems) in Hepes Buffered Saline/lmg bovine serum albumin was then passed over the captured antibodies on the sensorchip surface. The resulting sensorgrams were evaluated using BIA evaluation 3.1 software to provide kinetic data. Monomeric human ICAM- 1 was chosen, rather than the Fc-tagged material used in selections, so that a 1: 1 binding interaction could be modeled. \n\n\n The dissociation constants (Κ\nΌ\n) for the parent leads ICM 10064 and ICM0088 IgGl-\n\n\nTM under the chosen conditions were 205 nM and 627 nM respectively on human monomeric IC AM- 1. The dissociation constants for the affinity optimised variants of each ICM10064 and ICM10088 under the same conditions were between 1.7 and 9.9 nM, and between 19.6 and 261 nM respectively. \n\n\n There is an approximately 10-fold difference between the BIACORE™ affinities of the antibodies on recombinant monomeric IC AM- 1 , compared to the EC50 values obtained in the HeLa-OHIO CPE assay (see Table 2, Example 7 for CPE assay data). For this reason, we obtained additional affinity measurements of the antibodies on HeLa-OHIO cells using a DELFIA-based detection of IgGs (Perkin Elmer) as described in 'Assay 8' below. In this assay, the K\nD\n (dissociation constant) was inferred from the concentration of IgG which gave 50% of maximum binding when assessed using Prism curve-fitting software \n\n\n(GRAPHPAD™). By this analysis, the affinities of our optimised antibodies are all 100-400 pM, and more closely reflect the HeLa-OHIO CPE assay potency data. It is thought that ICAM-1 dimerizes on the cell surface (2), so the apparent increase in the affinity of anti- ICAM-1 antibodies to cells, compared to monomeric recombinant antigen, could be due to increased avidity of ICAM-1 in this presentation. \n\n\n The BIACORE™ and cell-binding affinity data both demonstrate improvement in affinity through the optimisation process, as was predicted by the potency gains previously \n\n described (Example 7). Additionally, the tolerance of lead sequences to sequence engineering is confirmed. Full affinity data is shown in Table 1. \n\n\n Table 1 - Affinities of antibody panel to recombinant monomeric ICAM-1 (n-1 to 3) \n\n\n \n\n hlA2 IgG2 1.26e5 2.76e-4 2.2 0.17\n\n\n14C11 ND ND ND 0.40\n\n\nRRl/1 ND ND ND 0.69 \n\n\nReferences: \n\n\n (1) Karlsson, R., et al.

The reagent was dissolved in anhydrous dimethylformamide and the PBS based protein solutions were adjusted to pH ~8 with 1 M NaHC0\n3\n in D-PBS. \n\n\n Cryptate labeling for HTRF® assays was achieved using Trisbipyridine-Eu\n3+\n- Cryptate-NHS (CIS bio International, product: 65EUSABA, lot: 09). The reagent was dissolved in anhydrous dimethylformamide and the PBS based protein solutions were adjusted to pH ~8 with 1 M NaHC0\n3\n in D-PBS. \n\n\n Label incorporations were assessed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in all cases and unreacted reagents were cleared by buffer exchange using D-PBS equilibrated disposable Sephadex G25 columns. For biotinylations the final protein concentrations were determined by 280 nm absorbance using extinction coefficients calculated from amino acid sequences. For Cryptate labeling final protein concentration was estimated using the Bradford (Bradford, 1977) dye-binding protein assay using known concentrations of the unlabelled protein as standard. \n\n\n ASSAY 1 - HRV:ICAM-1 Binding Assay \n\n\n In order to screen for molecules which could inhibit the infectivity of HRV a suitable assay was needed. Although assays which rely on infection of cells with virus are known such assays were unlikely to provide the necessary tolerance or high throughput required for \n\n screening of crude, bacterial derived samples. Similarly, assays dependent on measuring the interaction of individual proteins involved in recognition of the host cell by the virus - a so called \"biochemical' assay were unlikely to work as ICAM-1 is thought to bind to more than one partner on the HRV capsid. Accordingly, it was desirable to use intact unlabeled HRV in the assay. Furthermore, the assay must be sensitive enough to detect the low affinity interaction of monomelic ICAM-1 with HRV and the assay needed to be predictive of cell based infectivity assays. \n\n\n The key challenge in the development of a biochemical HRV:ICAM-1 binding inhibition assay lay in the technical issues of how to detect this binding event. From a user safety perspective a homogeneous assay format was essential to reduce risk of virus aerosol formation which would otherwise occur with a heterogeneous format. Typically a homogeneous binding inhibition assay would involve biologically tagging or otherwise labelling each partner molecule in the binding pair. However, the direct labelling of the HRV is technically very challenging and carried the risk of compromising the biological relevance of the assay should the labelling have adverse effect on virus structure / conformation. We exploited the multi-valency of the ICAM-1 :HRV interaction in the assay design thus negating the need to detect the HRV directly. More specifically, since each HRV particle contains approximately 60 ICAM- 1 binding by differentially tagging or labelling two different soluble ICAM-1 reagents we were able to detect the simultaneous interaction of both of these ICAM- 1 populations with live unmodified HRV using a proximity based homogeneous assay technology. The novel high throughput assay using homogeneous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF®) assay developed is based on the inhibition of HRV 16 binding to ICAM-1. The activity of inhibitors in this assay correlates well with activity in a cell based viral infectivity assay. This assay also enables true high throughput screening for inhibitors of HRV infection and facilitates screening with crude, bacterial derived sample material. The assay, schematically presented in Figure 16, involves a HRV 16 mediated TR-FRET signal between Eu-cryptate labeled ICAM-l-Fc and ICAM-1- FlagHislO / anti-Flag-XL\n665\n. The assay uses two different labeled ICAM-1 reagents, Eu-Cryptate labeled ICAM-l-Fc (labeled as described in Protein Modifications) and ICAM-1 Dl/5 FlagHislO (FLAG). Also the novelty of this format successfully avoids the use of anti-HRV antibodies which can be limited in terms of specificity to individual serotypes and commercial availability. \n\n\n The assay has been optimised for HTS of crude biological scFv peri-prep samples and IC\n50\n profiling of purified scFv and IgG in a 384 well format. As detailed below, the order of addition minimizes exposure to and handling of the HRV. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssay buffer - PBS containing 0.2 % BSA and 0.4 M Potassium Fluoride \n\n\n Anti-Flag XL665 Soln. - reconstituted with deionised water, as detailed in the instructions supplied, to 400 μ /ητΐ (2667 nM) \n\n\n Other Buffers - The reagents are diluted to the required working stock concentration (4X or 8X final) in assay buffer as shown in the table below. \n\n\nTable 3. Stock concentrations required for the assays. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (a) Sample Preparation \n\n\n For HTS screening, Peri-prep samples are supplied in 96 deep well plates (prepared in a 50 mM MOPS, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 M sorbitol (pH 7.4) buffer). \n\n\n During the lead isolation campaign, scFv's from the deep well block are transferred directly to the assay plate for the dilution required of 25 %. For example if a 25 % final sample percentage is required, 10 μΐ of scFv sample is transferred to a well containing a total assay volume of 40 μΐ. \n\n For HTS, where a prior dilution of samples is required, either Greiner 384 well polypropylene (Greiner, 781280) or Greiner 96 well polypropylene (Greiner, 650201) plates are used, depending on the level of dilution required. Depending on the required final sample concentration, more than one dilution plate maybe required. \n\n\n For IC\n50\n determinations, purified scFv's or IgGs are diluted 3-fold (15 μΐ of sample into 30 μΐ assay buffer) in assay buffer, to give 11 concentration points. 96 well Greiner polypropylene (Greiner, 650201) plates are used for dilution preparation. Generally each dilution is prepared in duplicate. \n\n\n (b) Sample Addition \n\n\n The samples are added to black non-binding surface 384 black clear bottom well plates (Costar 3665). Final 40 μΐ total assay volume per well. Control wells: Total Binding (TB) = 10 μΐ Anti-flag XL; 5 μΐ Eu-ICAM-l-Fc; 5 μΐ ICAM-1 Dl/5 FH; 10 μΐ HRV; 10 μΐ Assay Buffer; Non Specific Binding (NSB) = 10 μΐ Anti-flag XL; 5 μΐ Eu-ICAM-l-Fc, 15 μΐ Assay Buffer; 10 μΐ HRV. \n\n\n For HTS, samples are either added directly from the 96 well sample block, for 25% final sample concentration or are added from the appropriate dilution plate for lower concentrations. For IC\n50\n determinations, dilutions from the 96 well plate(s) are transferred to the assay plate in duplicate (if required). Samples from up to four 96 well plates may be combined into one 384 well assay plate, for example by loading them using a Z quadranting format. \n\n\n1. 10 μΐ of 32 nM concentration of Anti-flag XL is added to all wells including TB + NSB wells to give final concentration of 8 nM. \n\n\n 2. 5 μΐ of a 16 nM concentration of Eu-ICAM-lFc is added to all wells including TB + NSB wells to give a final concentration of 2nM. \n\n\n 3. 5 μΐ of a 48 nM concentration of ICAM-1 Dl/5 FH is added to all wells except NSB wells to give a final concentration of 6 nM. \n\n\n 4. 10 μΐ peri-prep material or dilution of scFv or IgG is added to all wells exncluding TB + NSB wells. The required volume of assay buffer is added to the TB and NSB wells to adjust the assay volume to 40ul. \n\n\n 5. 10 μΐ of 50 % HRV is added to all wells including TB + NSB wells, to give a final dilution of 12.5 % \n\n 6.

ASSAY 2 - LFA-1: ICAM-1 Binding Assay \n\n\n This homogeneous assay was developed based on the inhibition of human LFA-1 binding to human ICAM-1. This assay is based on the interaction of LFA- 1 -FlagHis9 (FH) binding to biotinylated ICAM-l-Fc in Alphascreen (Perkin Elmer) format. Bacterially expressed recombinant LFA-1 for this assay was in an Ί-domain open' conformation, generated by the introduction of pairs of cysteine residues that form disulphide bonds after \n\n refolding (1). The assay is sensitive to inhibition by neutralising scFv and is optimised for both HTS of crude scFv peri-prep samples and secondary IC\n50\n profiling of purified scFv in\n\n\n384 well formats. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssay buffer - 2 mM Magnesium Chloride (Sigma M2670), 0.1 % BSA (Sigma A9576) Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS; Gibco 14190). \n\n\nWorking solutions in Table 4 are generated from the stock solutions described above by appropriate dilution in assay buffer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sample Preparation \n\n\n For HTS screening, crude scFv peri-prep samples are supplied in 96 deep well plates\n\n\n(prepared in a 50 mM MOPS, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 M sorbitol (pH 7.4) buffer). \n\n During the lead isolation campaign, scFv peri-prep samples from the deep well blocks were transferred directly to the assay plate for the dilution required of 24 %. For example if a\n\n\n24 % final sample percentage is required, 6 μΐ of scFv sample is transferred to a well containing a total assay volume of 25 μΐ. \n\n\n For HTS, where a prior dilution of samples is required, then either Greiner 384 well polypropylene (Greiner, 781280) or Greiner 96 well polypropylene (Greiner, 650201) are used, depending on the level of dilution required. Depending on the required final sample concentration, more than one dilution plate maybe required. \n\n\n For IC\n50\n determinations the samples are diluted 3-fold (for example, 15 μΐ of sample into 30 μΐ of assay buffer), to give 11 concentration points. 96 well Greiner polypropylene (Greiner, 650201) plates are used for dilution preparation. Generally each dilution is prepared in duplicate. \n\n\n (e) Sample Addition \n\n\n For HTS or IC\n50\n determination the starting concentrations of biotinylated ICAM- 1 Fc, LFA-1 FH and Alphascreen beads are different (see Table 4) though working concentrations are the same. Exact volumes of each added to the assay wells are therefore altered accordingly. \n\n\n The samples are added to 384 white well assay plate (Optiplate, 6007298). Final 25 μΐ total assay volume per well. Control wells: Total Binding (TB) = 0.4nM Bio-ICAM-l-Fc; 13.3 nM LFA-1 FH; 5 or 6 μΐ of bead mix (HTS or IC\n50\n determination respectively); up to a final well volume of 25 μΐ with assay buffer; Non Specific Binding (NSB) = 13.3 nM LFA-1 FH; 5 or 6 μΐ of bead mix (HTS or IC\n50\n determination respectively); up to a final well volume of\n\n\n25 μΐ with assay buffer. \n\n\n For HTS, samples are either added directly from the 96 well sample block, for 24 % final sample concentration or are added from the appropriate dilution plate. For IC\n50\n determinations, dilutions from the 96 well plate(s) are transferred to the assay plate in duplicate (if required). Samples from up to four 96 well plates may be combined into one 384 well assay plate, for example by loading them using a Z quadranting format. 1. Bio-ICAM- 1 -Fc is added to all wells except NSB wells to give a final concentration of 0.4 nM. \n\n\n 2. Test sample is added to all wells excluding TB + NSB wells as follows: 6 μΐ of peri- prep samples is added directly from the 96 well sample block for 24 % final sample \n\n concentration, or 7.5 μΐ diluted scFv or IgG is added from the dilution plates, assay buffer is added to TB and NSB wells to equalize the volume between all the wells.\n\n\n3. Incubate for 30 mins @ room temperature \n\n\n 4. LFA-1 FH is added to all wells including TB + NSB wells to give a final \n\n\n concentration of 13.3 nM. \n\n\n 5. 6 or 5 μΐ Alphascreen bead mix (HTS or IC\n50\n determination respectively) is added to all wells in the dark room under a green filtered light (Roscolux Chroma green # 389) to give a final bead concentration for both assay formats of 20-60 μg/ml. \n\n\n 6. Seal the plates and incubate the plates for 1.5 hrs in the dark at room temperature. 7. After incubation, remove the seals quickly and fluorescence measured using a 570 nm emission filter on a PerkinElmer ENVISION™ plate reader, or similar equipment. \n\n\n (f) Data analysis \n\n\n Data is expressed as percentage specific binding ((Sample -NSB/Total-NSB)*100) using manual data analysis in MS Excel. \n\n\n (g) IC50 determinations \n\n\n The data is analysed using 4-parameter logistic equation with GRAPHPAD™ Prism version 5 (GraphPad Inc, California) to give apparent IC\n50\n values. Y= Bottom + (Top- Bottom)/ (1+10\nΛ\n ((Log IC50-X)*HillSlope)) where X is the logarithm of concentration and Y is the % specific binding. The IC\n50\n is the sample concentration that produces 50 % inhibition of specific binding. \n\n\nReference \n\n\n 1.

ASSAY 6 - Human ICAM-1 HTRF® epitope competition assay \n\n This competition assay is based on the displacement of the lead antibody clone binding to ICAM-1 by scFv/ IgGs that bind the same epitope. The assay has been optimized for high throughput screening and IC\n50\n determination, to identify and characterise ICAM-1 neutralising single chains and IgGs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock concentrations may alter depending on Batch available. \n\n\n Assay buffer - PBS containing 0.2 % BSA and 0.2-0.4 M Potassium Fluoride \n\n\n (j) Streptavidin XL conjugate antibody - Streptavidin XL665\n\n\n(611SAXLB) is reconstituted with deionised water, as detailed in the instructions supplied, tolOOO Mg/ml (16.6 μΜ). \n\n\n Other Buffers - The stock reagents are diluted to the required working stock concentration (4X final) in assay buffer as shown in the table below. \n\n\nTable 6. Stock concentrations required for the assays. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (k) Sample Dilutions \n\n\n Peri-prep samples are supplied in 96 deep well plates (prepared in a 50 mM MOPS, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 M sorbitol (pH 7.4) buffer). During Lead Optimisation, the \n\n\n concentration of crude peri-prep scFv added to the assay needs to be optimised to allow a window for detection of improved clones over the parent lead clones. This is monitored throughout the process and crude scFv concentration is reduced as more potent clones are identified. ScFv material is therefore added to the assay at a range of dilutions from 25 % final scFv percentage (where neat scFv is added to assay plate) to 0.015 % final scFv percentage during the later stages of Lead Optimisation. \n\n\n For HTS screening the peri-prep scFv samples are diluted in assay buffer as required using either Greiner 384 well polypropylene (Greiner, 781280) or Greiner 96 well polypropylene (Greiner, 650201) are used, depending on the level of dilution required. ScFv from the deep well block is transferred to a 96 well plate containing an appropriate volume of assay buffer for the dilution required. For example if a 0.68 % final sample percentage is required, 5 μΐ of scFv sample is transferred to a 96 well plate containing 180 μΐ of assay buffer. Depending on the required final sample concentration, more than one dilution plate maybe required. \n\n\n For IC\n50\n determinations the purified scFv's are diluted 3-fold (40+80=120 μΐ) in assay buffer to give 11 concentration points. 96 well Greiner polypropylene (Greiner, 650201) plates are used for dilution preparation. \n\n\n (1) Sample Addition \n\n\n The samples are added to 384 black shallow well plate(s) (Costar 3676). Final 20 μΐ volume per well. Control wells: Total Binding (TB) = 5 μΐ assay buffer; 5 μΐ Bio- ICM10064/88; 5 μΐ Eu-ICAM-l-Fc; 5 μΐ Streptavidin XL\nent\n soln; Non Specific Binding (NSB) = 10 μΐ assay buffer; 5 μΐ Eu-ICAM-l-Fc; 5 μΐ Streptavidin XL\nent\n soln. \n\n For HTS, samples are either added directly from the 96 well sample block, for 25 % final sample concentration, or from the 96 well dilution plates for lower final concentrations. For IC\n50\n determinations, dilutions from the 96 well plate(s) are transferred to the assay plate in duplicate. Samples from up to four 96 well plates may be combined into one 384 well assay plate, for example by loading them using a Z quadranting format. \n\n\n (m) Reagent additions \n\n\n 1. 5 μΐ of the test solution is added to the test sample wells (excluding TB and NSB \n\n\n wells) \n\n\n 2. 5 μΐ of Bio-ICM10064/88 solution is added to the test sample wells and the TB wells 3. 5 μΐ of Eu-cryptate ICAM-l-Fc solution is added to all the assay wells including TB and NSB wells \n\n\n 4. 5 μΐ of Streptavidin XL\nent\n solution is added to all the assay wells including TB and NSB wells, assay buffer is added to TB and NSB wells to adjust the assay volume to 20 μΐ. \n\n\n 5. The plates are sealed and incubated for 3 hours at room temperature \n\n\n The plate seals are removed and the fluorescence measured on a PerkinElmer ENVISION™ plate reader, or similar equipment, using a 320 nm excitation filter and 620 nm and 665 nm emission filters. The data are analyzed using the same methods and equations (i-iv) as described above for the HRV:ICAM-1 Binding Assay (Assay 1). \n\n\nASSAY 7 - Primary Airway Epithelial Cell Infectivity Assay \n\n\n This assay uses viral RNA readouts 24 hours post infection as a measure of viral infection inhibition in human primary airway epithelial cells.

Viruses were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and passaged them five times in HeLa cells before purification. The viruses were titrated on HeLa cells by standard methods and inactivated by exposure to UV light at 1,200 mJ/cm for 30 min. \n\n\n In vitro assessment of anti- viral activity (Cytopathic Effect Assay): Plates were coated with HeLa HI cells and incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% C0\n2\n. Anti-ICAM-1 (14C11; R&D \n\n Systems) or isotype control (Mouse IgGi; R&D Systems) were added in serial dilutions and the plate incubated for 30mins. Different HRV strains were diluted to an MOI that kills 80- 90% of viral control cells, then added to the plate. The plate was incubated further for 2h at 33°C, 5% C0\n2\n, and then completely aspirated. Fresh media (DMEM +3% FCS; both Invitrogen) was added to the plate, and incubated for another 48h. CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega) was added to the plate, incubated for lOmins and chemiluminescence read on a Microbeta Jet (Perkin Elmer). \n\n\n Generation of HuICAM-1 transgenic mice: Since mouse ICAM-1 does not bind HRV, transgenic mice were generated that overexpress a chimeric form of human (D1-D2) and mouse ICAM-1 (D3-D5) under control of the CMV promoter as previously described\n\n\n(Bartlett et al, 2008 Nat Med 14(2): 199-204). Briefly, an expression construct containing the CMV promoter controlled-human-mouse ICAM-1 chimera was excised from pHu/MuICAM- 11 and electroporated into HM-1 embryonic stem (ES) cells to create stable recombinant G418-resistant ES cell lines. Genomic DNA from ES cell lines was screened for \n\n\npHu/MuICAM- 1-specific sequence by PCR using the primers NS 25 (GGG CAG TCA CAG CTA AAA CCT; SEQ ID NO: 486) and NS 26 (TCC AGG GAG CAA AAC AAC TTC T; SEQ ID NO: 487). Chimeric mice were generated by C57 BL/6 J blastocyst microinjection of pHu/MuICAM-1 ES cell clones. Transmission of the Hu/MuICAM-1 transgene was confirmed by PCR analysis as described above. Positive offspring were bred onto the BALB/c background by 10 successive backcross matings of male transgenic mice to wild type BALB/c females. Genomic DNA from experimental animals were screened by PCR to identify Hu/MuICAM-1 positives and negatives, and grouped accordingly before infection. All animal work completed in accordance with UK Home Office guidelines. \n\n\nInduction of HRV infection in vivo: Female huICAM-1 Tg mice and wild type (Balb/c) were anaesthetized with isoflurane, and then infected with 50ul of purified HRV. The amount of virus is stated in each figure legend. After 48hrs (HRV14 and HRV16) or 24 and 96hrs (HRV- IB), mice were euthanized, and endpoints analyzed. In order to assess the dependency of HRV infection on ICAM-1, anti-ICAM-1 antibody (14C11) or isotype control (Mouse IgGi) was given either systemically (i.v.; 2-20mg/kg 24h prior to infection) or topically (i.n.; l-100μg per mouse 2h prior to infection). In some experiments, further groups of mice were analyzed 4d and 7d post infection.LPS-induced inflammation model: Female huICAM-1 Tg mice and wild type (Balb/c) were anaesthetized with isoflurane, and then dosed with 100μg LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) intranasally. Mice were treated with anti-ICAM-1 \n\n antibody (14C11) i.v. at a dose of 20mg/kg 24h prior to LPS administration. After 24hrs, mice were euthanized, and endpoints analyzed. \n\n\n Analysis of cellular inflammation: Mice were canulated via the trachea and lavaged with a volume of 1.5 ml of BAL buffer (EBSS, 55mM EDTA, 12mM lidocaine). Total BAL was separated into cell and supernatant fractions. Cells were processed by cytospin for differential staining and supernatants were stored at -80°C. Cells were re-suspended, counted and cytospins prepared and stained with xanthene and thiazine ( wik-diff stain). Slides were air- dried and differentially counted (400xmagnification) by observers blind to experimental conditions with 400 cells counted per slide. \n\n\nAnalysis of cytokines: Cytokines (IT AC, IP- 10, ΙΡΝ-λ3) were assessed in BAL fluid by quantitative ELISA according to manufacturers' specifications (R&D Systems). \n\n\n Analysis of HRV-specific IgGs: Plates (Maxisorp, Nunc) were coated overnight with purified rhinovirus stock (2 ¾10\n8\n TCIDso/ml). Diluted serum samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C before detection with peroxidase-conjugated antibody to mouse IgG (Sigma). \n\n\nRESULTS: \n\n\n Anti-ICAM-1 is effective across multiple major serotype HRV strains in vitro: Major serotype HRVs use ICAM-1 as their entry receptor to induce viral infection. We used a cytopathic effect assay to assess the ability of an antibody against ICAM-1 (14C11) to prevent viral infection in vitro. These studies show, anti-ICAM-1 antibody was effective at inhibiting virus-induced cell death against all major group serotypes tested with IC50S ranging from 0.27nM to 4.50nM (Table 7). Anti-ICAM-1 antibody also showed efficacy against Cocksackie virus A21 (CV-A21), which has also been shown to use ICAM-1 as its entry receptor (Table 7). In contrast, this antibody had no effect at inhibiting the minor serotype HRV-25, which uses the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor for viral entry (Table 7).\n\n\nThese data indicate that IC AM- 1 blockade may be an effective strategy at inhibiting infection with major serotype HRV, and other viruses that use ICAM-1 to mediate viral entry. \n\n\nTable 7 Anti-ICAM-1 antibody has anti- viral effects against multiple strains of major serotype HRV - Serial dilutions of anti-ICAM-1 antibody were used in a cytopathic effect assay to inhibit multiple strains of HRV and one strain of Cocksackie virus (CV-A21).

In order to test the efficacy of anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies against HRV in vivo, transgenic mice (huICAM-1 Tg) were generated in which a chimeric form of human and mouse ICAM-1 is overexpressed. This chimeric protein contains domains 1 and 2 from human ICAM-1 in which the binding for HRV resides. HuICAM-1 Tg mice and wild type controls were infected with major group HRV-16. In order to determine whether anti-ICAM- 1 antibody pretreatment could reduce virally induced inflammation, mice were dosed systemically with anti-ICAM- 1 24h prior to virus infection. HRV-16 was unable to induce inflammation in wild type mice due to the lack of human ICAM-1 expression. However, in the HuICAM-1 Tg mice, increased numbers of leukocytes were found in the airway lumen, and differential counting revealed these increases to be due to lymphocytes and neutrophils (Figure 10A-D). Administration of anti-ICAM-1 at doses of both 2mg/kg and 20mg/kg profoundly decreased cell influx into the airway lumen compared with isotype control (Figure 10A-D). \n\n\n Expression of virally-induced cytokines was also examined, with HuICAM-1 Tg showing significantly elevated levels of ΙΡΝλ3, IP- 10 and IT AC compared with wild type controls (Figure 10E-G). As with cellular inflammation, anti-ICAM-1 markedly decreased expression of these cytokines (Figure 10E-G). Taken together, these data show that anti- ICAM- 1 given prophylactically and systemically can profoundly reduce inflammation and cytokine expression induced by HRV-16. \n\n\n Similarly, we wanted to establish if topical dosing of anti-ICAM-1 was also effective at preventing HRV-16 infection. Thus, huICAM-1 Tg and wild type mice were infected with HRV-16, and anti-ICAM-1 antibody was dosed intranasally 2h prior to virus infection at 1, 10 and 100μg per mouse). At the lowest dose (lμg per mouse) of anti-ICAM-1 antibody there was no effect on inflammation or cytokine expression induced by HRV-16 (Figure 11A-G). However, both 10 and 100μg dosing of anti-ICAM-1 elicited significant inhibition of the viral response, indicating that prophylactic anti-ICAM- 1 dosing is effective both topically and systemically. (Figure 11A-G). \n\n In order to establish whether anti-ICAM- 1 changes the progression of HRV-16 infection, a time course was set up, in which huICAM-1 Tg and wild type mice were subjected HRV-16 infection, and analyzed 2, 4 and 7 days after virus infection. Anti-ICAM -\n\n\n1 was dosed topically at 10(^g per mouse 2h prior to infection. Significant increases in lung inflammation were seen at every time point when huICAM- 1 Tg mice were compared with wild type controls (Figure 12A-D). Expression of IFN 3 and ΓΡ-10 was increased at both 2 and 4 days but had subsided by day 7 (Figure 12E-F). ITAC levels were also elevated at day\n\n\n2 but were back to control levels by day 4 (Figure 12G). Administration of anti-ICAM- 1 reduced all parameters measured and furthermore we found that one dose of the antibody was sufficient to suppress viral infection over 7 days (Figure 12A-G). In addition, we examined levels of virus-specific antibodies in the serum on day 7 following infection, and determined that anti-ICAM-1 antibody was capable of suppressing HRV-16 specific IgGi and IgG\n2a\n levels in serum (Figure 12H-I). This suggests that prophylactic treatment with anti-ICAM-1 antibody significantly reduces a virus-specific immune response. \n\n\nAnti-ICAM-1 is similarly effective against HRV-14 infection: After having established that anti-ICAM-1 antibody pretreatment is effective at inhibiting HRV- 16- induced inflammation, we tested whether this antibody would show similar efficacy against another major serotype rhinovirus, HRV-14. HuICAM- lTg and wild type mice were infected with HRV-14 and received either anti-ICAM-1 antibody or isotype control 2h prior to infection via the intranasal route. HRV-14 induced similar inflammation and cytokine expression in the huICAM-1 Tg mice as seen with HRV-16 (Figure 13A-G). Importantly, anti-ICAM-1 antibody was also capable of markedly suppressing the inflammatory response to HRV-14 following topical pretreatment (Figure 13A-G). These data strongly indicate that the effects of this ICAM-1 blockade are not restricted to HRV-16 but also apply to HRV-14, and therefore may also be extrapolated to multiple major group HRV serotypes. \n\n\nAnti-ICAM-1 has no effect against inflammation induced by the minor serotype HRV1B or by LPS: In order to confirm that the effects of ICAM-1 blockade were specific to the inhibition of ICAM-1 :HRV interactions, rather than effects on cell-cell interactions in the huICAM- 1 Tg mouse, we firstly examined the efficacy of anti-ICAM-1 antibody treatment in a model of HRV- IB infection, and compared it with HRV-16. This minor serotype HRV does not use ICAM-1 for viral entry and thus should be unaffected by ICAM-1 blockade. Unlike major serotype HRVs, HRV- IB is able to infect wild type mice, and therefore UV- \n\n inactivated HRV-IB was used as a control. As shown previously, HRV-16-induced inflammation was blocked by anti-ICAM- 1 antibody after systemic pretreatment (Figure 14A-K). In contrast, while HRV-IB induced robust inflammation and cytokine expression in both wild type and transgenic animals, this was unaffected by anti-ICAM- 1 antibody (Figure 14A-K). \n\n\n As further confirmation that the effects of anti-ICAM- 1 antibody against HRV-14 and HRV-16 were indeed specific to ICAM-1: virus interactions, we assessed the effects of this antibody in LPS-induced inflammation. HuICAM-1 Tg mice were systemically pretreated with anti-ICAM- 1 then challenged with LPS intranasally. LPS induced cellular inflammation consisting of lymphocytes and neutrophils, and increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-Ιβ, IL-6 and KC (Figure 15A-G). These studies show that anti-ICAM- 1 antibody had no effect on any of these parameters. Taken together, these data strongly indicated that anti-ICAM- 1 blockade specifically inhibits inflammation induced specifically by major serotype HRVs. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 13 - Humanization of the mouse anti-human ICAM antibody 14C11 \n\n\n As shown in Example 12, we have demonstrated for the first time that the mouse monoclonal antibody 14C11 has similar properties to the fully human anti-ICAM- 1 antibodies described above (see Examples 1-11). Accordingly, humanization of the 14C11 antibody could be used to generate an antibody appropriate for therapeutic use in humans. De novo protein sequencing may be used to determine the protein sequence of the variable regions of both the heavy and light chains of 14C 11 and humanized antibodies are generated using recombinant synthesis techniques (see for example, Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Reichmann et al., et al, Nature 332:323 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239: 1534- 1536 (1988); Studnicka et al, Protein Engineering 7(6):805-814 (1994); Roguska. et al, PNAS 91:969-973 (1994)), chain shuffling strategies (see for example U.S. Patent No. \n\n\n5,565,332; Rader et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1998) 95:8910-8915). \n\n\n De novo protein sequence analysis may be performed essentially as described by Pham et al. (Analytical Biochemistry, 2006, 352:77-86). Briefly, the 14C11 antibody and isolated Fab fragments are reduced and alkylated, the heavy and light chains are separated by protein gel electrophoresis and/or reverse-phase HPLC for further analysis. A portion of the separated chains are electroblotted to solid supports (e.g., polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)) membrane for N-terminal sequencing, treating with PGAP if needed to remove any pyroglutamyl blocking groups. The immobilized material is then cleaved into peptides using \n\n either chemical or protease cleavage. The resulting peptides are then subjected to additional N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation and sequence analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Alternatively, a commercial vendor (e.g., Proteome Factory AG, Berline Germany) may be used to determine the protein sequence of the variable regions of 14C11. \n\n\n Once the sequence of the heavy and light chain variable regions of 14C11 has been determined, humanization may be accomplished by a number of well known methods in the art. For example, the most closely related human antibody framework can be identified by sequence alignment. The 14C 11 nucleotide sequence can them be mutated such that the human amino acid sequence is encoded at framework positions that differ between the mouse and human. Mutagenesis can be performed, for example by rapid site-directed mutagenesis, using readily available commercial reagent (e.g. QuickChange® Site-Direct Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene). Often the sequence will be mutated such that certain framework positions are maintained as donor residues to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework positions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323 (1988)). \n\n\n The reagents employed in the examples are commercially available or can be prepared using commercially available instrumentation, methods, or reagents known in the art.

Current treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are efficacious, but show a prevalence for gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects. There is a high need for new treatment options showing equivalent efficacy with an improved side effect profile. \n\n\nmPGES inhibitors may show such an improved side effect profile because they block the generation of PGE\n2\n in a more specific manner as described below. \n\n\n NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors reduce inflammation and pain through inhibition of one or both isoformes of COX enzymes. The cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme exists in two forms, one that is constitutively expressed in many cells and tissues (COX-1), and one that in most cells and tissues is induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as cytokines, during an inflammatory response (COX-2). COXs metabolise arachidonic acid to the unstable intermediate prostaglandin H\n2\n (PGH\n2\n). PGH\n2\n is further metabolized to other prostaglandins including PGE\n2\n, PGF\n2\nc PGD\n2\n, prostacyclin and thromboxane A\n2\n. These arachidonic acid metabolites are known to have pronounced physiological and pathophysiological activity including proinflammatory effects. PGE\n2\n in particular is known to be a strong pro-inflammatory mediator, and is also known to induce fever, inflammation and pain. Consequently, numerous drugs were developed with a view to inhibiting the formation of PGE\n2\n, including \"NSAIDs\" (non- steroidal antiinflammatory drugs) and \"coxibs\" (selective COX-2 inhibitors). These drugs act predominantly by inhibition of COX-1 and/or COX-2, thereby reducing the formation of PGE\n2\n.\n\n\nHowever, the inhibition of COXs has the disadvantage that it results in the reduction of the formation of all metabolites downstream of PGH\n2\n, some of which are known to have beneficial properties. In view of this, drugs which act by inhibition of COXs are therefore known/suspected to cause adverse biological effects. \n\n For example, the non-selective inhibition of COXs by NSAIDs may give rise to gastrointestinal side-effects and affect platelet and renal function. Even the selective inhibition of COX-2 by coxibs, whilst reducing such gastrointestinal side-effects, is believed to give rise to cardiovascular problems. \n\n\n An alternative treatment of inflammatory diseases that does not give rise to the above- mentioned side effects would thus be of real benefit in the clinic. In particular, a drug that preferably inhibits the transformation of PGH\n2\n to the pro-inflammatory mediator PGE\n2\n selectively might be expected to reduce the inflammatory response in the absence of a corresponding reduction of the formation of other, beneficial arachidonic acid metabolites. Such inhibition would accordingly be expected to alleviate the undesirable side-effects mentioned above. \n\n\n PGH\n2\n may be transformed to PGE\n2\n by prostaglandin E synthases (PGES). Two microsomal prostaglandin E synthases (mPGES-1 and mPGES-2), and one cytosolic prostaglandin E synthase (cPGES) have been described. mPGES-1 is proposed to be closely linked to COX- 2 and both enzyme's are upregulated during e.g. inflammation. Thus agents that are capable of inhibiting the action of mPGES-1 and thereby reducing the formation of PGE\n2\n are likely to be of benefit for the treatment of inflammation and more general acute and chronic pain conditions \n\n\nBenzimidazole and imidazopyridine derivatives with mPGES-1 inhibitory activity are disclosed in WO 2010/034796, WO 2010/034797, WO 2010/034798, WO 2010/034799. \n\n\nPCT/EP2010/052799 describes a broad class of different 2-arylamino benzimidazoles in which the aryl group bears a particular side chain. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nThe present invention is a selection from the general formula of PCT/EP2010/052799 providing compounds that unexpectedly show improved activity in a cell based \n\n\npharmacological assay. \n\n\nCompounds with a similar affinity for the mPGES-1 enzyme as measured in the enzyme assay may have different potencies in the cell-based assay. \n\n\n Data from a cell based pharmacological assay when compared with data from an enzyme assay are considered to allow for a better predictibility and estimation of therapeutic effective concentrations/doses. Compounds of the present invention show high potency in both assays. Consequently, they are likely to be more suitable for the in-vivo use. \n\n The present invention provides a compound of formula I, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindependently represent halo, -Ci\n-3\nalkyl, which latter alkyl group is optionally substituted by one or more fluorine atoms; represents -C(O)-, -C(0)0-, which groups are bound to the nitrogen of the - NH- moiety via the carbon atom; represents \n\n\n -Ci\n-6\nalkyl, -C\n3\n.\n7\ncycloalkyl, both of which groups are optionally substituted by one or more groups selected from -F, -OH, -CN, -NH\n2\n, -NH(Ci.\n2\nalkyl), -N (Ci\n-2\nalkyl)\n2\n, -OCi.\n3\nalkyl, -Ci\n-5\nalkyl, -C\n3\n.\n4\ncycloalkyl, in which latter three groups the alkyl or cycloalkyi groups are optionally substituted by one or more fluorine atoms; \n\n\n or \n\n\n oxetanyl-, tetrahydrofuranyl-, tetrahydropyranyl-, azetidinyl-, pyrrolidinyl-, piperidinyl-, all of which groups are optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from fluoro, -CN, -Ci\n-3\n alkyl, which latter alkyl group is optionally substituted by one or more fluorine atoms; \n\n\n or \n\n\n phenyl-, pyridyl-, thienyl-, pyrrolyl-, pyrazolyl-, imidazolyl-, thiazolyl-, oxazolyl-, or isoxazolyl-, all of which groups are optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from halo, -CN or -Ci\n-3\nalkyl, which latter alkyl group is optionally further substituted by one or more fluorine atoms; represents -H, halogen, -Ci\n-3\nalkyl, which latter alkyl group is optionally substituted by one or more fluorine atoms; \n\n represents -H, -Ci\n-5\nalkyl, -C3.\n5\ncycloalkyl-C\n0\n-2alkyl, in which latter three groups the alkyi or cycloalkyi fragments are optionally substituted by one or more fluorine atoms; represents halo, Ci.\n5\nalkyl-0-, C\n3\n.\n7\ncycloalkyl-Co-2alkyl-0-, 4-7-membered heterocycloalkyl-C\n0\n-2alkyl-O-, in which latter three groups the alkyi, cycloalkyi or heterocycloalkyi fragments are optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from -F and -OCi.\n3\nalkyl which latter alkyi group is optionally further substituted by one or more fluorine atoms; represents Ci_\n8\n alkyi-, phenyl-, indanyl-, naphthyl-, 1 ,2,3,4- tetrahydronaphthyl-, pyridyl-, thienyl-, benzothienyl-, pyrrolyl-, indolyl- pyrazolyl-, indazolyl-, thiazolyl-, benzothiazolyl-, oxazolyl-, benzoxazolyl-, isoxazolyl-, benzisoxazolyl-, phenyl-Ci.\n3\nalkyl-, thienyl-Ci\n-3\nalkyl-, \n\n\n pyridyl-Ci.\n3\nalkyl-, C\n3\n.\n7\ncycloalkyl-C\n0\n.\n3\nalkyl-, oxetanyl-C\n0\n.\n3\nalkyl-, tetra- hydrofuranyl-C\n0\n-\n3\nalkyl, tetrahydropyranyl-C\n0\n.\n3\nalkyl, in which groups the alkyl- , cycloalkyi- and heterocycloalkyi fragments are optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from R\n9a\n and the aryl and heteroaryl fragments are optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from R\n9b\n; independently represents -F, -CI, -Ci\n-3\nalkyl which is optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from -F, -OCi_\n3\n alkyi; represents independently -halo, -CN; -Ci\n-3\n alkyi which is optionally substituted by one or more fluorine atoms; a salt thereof, particularly a physiologically acceptable salt thereof. \n\n\nIn second embodiment, in the general formula I, A, M, W, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n have the same meaning as defined in any of the preceding embodiments, and \n\n\nR\n8\n represents -H or fluoro. \n\n In another embodiment, in the general formula I, A, M, W, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n7\n, R\n8\n have the same meaning as defined in any of the preceding embodiments, and \n\n\nR\n6\n represents -H, -CH\n3\n, cyclopropyl.

Incubate 8h at 37 °C with 200rpm. Thereafter, inoculate 500-1000 ml LB containing Amp and Chloro with the 5 ml on culture and grow to OD640 of 0.8-1.0. Chill the culture to +4°C before induction. Induce the culture with IPTG at a final concentration of 400μΜ. Express the protein at room temp 18-23 °C with 200 rpm shaking over night. \n\n\nThe following steps can be performed on the following day: \n\n\n 1. Spin down the cells in 250ml centrifuge flasks for 15min at 7000rpm (Beckmann\n\n\nCoulte Avanti J-E centrifuge) \n\n\n 2. Dissolve the pellet from 250ml culture in 12.5 ml homogenization buffer \n\n\n 3.

Disintegrate the cells by sonication, 5X10 seconds at 48% amplitude of a 750W \n\n\n sonifier \n\n\n 5. Add 2.5ml MgCI\n2\n (100mM) and DNase 12.5μΙ (0.8mg/ml) and incubate on ice for 30 mm \n\n\n 6. Spin down the bacteria debris and save the supernatant, 7000 rpm for 15 min\n\n\n7. Isolate the protein containing membranes in the supernatant by ultracentrifugation 120000 x g for 2hour at 4°C (Sorvall T880 rotor). \n\n\n 8. Discard the supernatant and dissolve the pellet in 20mM Potassium phosphate buffer pH7.4 (KH\n2\nP0\n4\n and K\n2\nHP0\n4\n) buffer by sonication (5x10s, 30% of a 50W sonifier) and aliquot the enzyme and store aliquots at -80°C. \n\n\nBefore each experiment is performed an aliquot of the enzyme is thawed and it can then be dissolved in 0.1 M Potassium phosphate buffer pH7.4 (KH\n2\nP0\n4\n and K\n2\nHP0\n4\n) buffer containing 2,5 mM GSH. \n\n mPGES-1 enzyme assay \n\n\nThe aim of this assay is to determine the affinity of a test compound for the mPGES-1 enzyme. \n\n\n47μΙ of recombinant human mPGES-1 (~ 0.5 protein/well) containing microsomal suspension in a buffer containing GSH, (2.5 mmol/L L-Glutathione reduced, dissolved in 0.1 mol/L Phosphat Buffer pH 7.4) is dispensed in a 384-well plate and thereafter 1 μΙ of the test compound(s) is/are added and incubated for 25 minutes at room temperature. The enzyme reaction is started by the addition of 2ul PGH2 (final cone. 2 μΜ) disolved in water- free Diglyme. After 60 seconds the reaction is terminated by addition of a stop solution containing FeCI\n2\n (10μΙ_ 0.074mol/l FeCI\n2\n). The samples are diluted between 1 :25 in PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline). 10μΙ of the diluted samples are transferred to 384-well low volume plate. In order to quantify the amount of PGE\n2\n that has been formed, a homogenous time resolved fluorescent (HTRF) detecting of PGE\n2\n has been performed using a \n\n\ncommercially available kit from Cisbio according to the manufactures recommendation. This HTRF -based assay has been described in detail (see: Goedken et al., J Biomol Screen, 2008, 13(7), 619-625). Briefly, the diluted samples are mixed with 5μΙ PGE\n2\n-d2 conjungate and 5μΙ anti-PGE\n2\n cryptate conjungate. After an incubation period of the plates over night, the fluorescence is measured by the use of an appropriate microplate reader. \n\n\nThe fluorescence of Europium cryptate (maxex = 307 nm, maxem = 620 nm) and d2-PGE\n2\n (maxex = 620 nm, maxem = 665 nm) are measured. \n\n\n The extent of the specific HTRF is measured as a ratio of the emission intensity at 665 nm vs. that at 620 nm at an excitation puis of 320 nm. The quantification plate contains also wells with different concentrations of PGE\n2\n as calibration curve for the calculation of the PGE\n2\n concentrations from the HTRF ratio values. \n\n\nFrom all mPGES enzyme assay the background is subtracted and the IC\n50\n is calculated over a nonlinear regression with conventional software. \n\n Table A. mPGES-1 inhibitory effect (IC\n50\n values in nM) of compounds in the enzyme assay \n\n\nIC50 IC50 IC50 IC50 example [nM] example [nM] example [nM] example [nM]\n\n\n1 2 26 2 51 3 76 3\n\n\n2 2 27 4 52 4 77 2 \n\n\n 3 4 28 3 53 4 78 2 \n\n\n 4 4 29 4 54 3 79 2 \n\n\n 5 2 30 4 55 4 80 1 \n\n\n 6 2 31 3 56 4 81 3\n\n\n7 2 32 3 57 4 82 1 \n\n\n 8 3 33 4 58 3 \n\n\n 9 4 34 4 59 4 \n\n\n 10 7 35 4 60 3 85 1 \n\n\n 11 4 36 4 61 4 177 1 \n\n\n 12 4 37 5 62 2 178 1 \n\n\n 13 3 38 3 63 3 179 1 \n\n\n 14 1 39 4 64 2 180 2 \n\n\n 15 3 40 4 65 4 \n\n\n 16 5 41 4 66 4 \n\n\n 17 1 42 4 67 2 \n\n\n 18 1 43 4 68 2 \n\n\n 19 1 44 3 69 2 \n\n\n 20 3 45 4 70 4 \n\n\n 21 3 46 3 71 2 \n\n\n 22 2 47 3 72 1 \n\n\n 23 1 48 3 73 2 \n\n\n 24 3 49 4 74 9 \n\n\n 25 2 50 4 75 2 \n\n A549 cell-based assay \n\n\nAlthough the enzymatic assay is a high throughput assay the disadvantage is that it uses a recombinant protein which is not in its natural enviroment. Accordingly a cellular assay was established in which a cell line of human origin (A549) expressing the mPGES-1 protein was used. In addtion in order to mimic the situation in humans in which compounds can be bound to plasma proteins 50% human serum is added in the assay. By having the combination of testing mPGES-1 in a cellular enviroment and the presence of 50% human serum this assay has a higher relevance to judge the therapeutic potential of a mPGES-inhibitor than the pure enzyme assay. \n\n\nA549 cells (ATCC: CCL-185) are grown to about 90% confluence in F-12K Nutrient Mixture (Kaighn's Mod. Gibco) containing 10% FBS in a humified incubator at 37°C and 5% C0\n2\n. Cells were detached using Trypsin-EDTA. A549 cells were seeded in a 384-well collagene plate at a density of 7000 cells/well (50μΙ) in F-12 medium containing 1 % Penicillin- Streptomycin and 50% human serum. The cells were allowed to attach for 3-4h. After that the cells were incubated for 20-24h in F-12k medium supplemented with 50 % human serum, 1 % Penicillin-Streptomycin and containing I L-1 β at a final concentration of 5 ng/ml as well as 10 nM arachidonic acid in the presence of a vehicle or a test compound. The total volume is 100 μΙ. \n\n\n Concentrations of PGE\n2\n in the cell free medium (10 μΙ) were measured using a commercially available HTRF kit from Cisbio (as described above). The PGE\n2\n formation in the absence of test compound was taken as 100%. \n\n\nIC\n50\n values were derived from at 6-8 point titrations using conventional software. \n\n\nThe compounds listed in table B are efficacious to block the generation of PGE\n2\n. Compounds of formula I may therefore be expected to have therapeutic potential to treat inflammatory diseases and associated conditions such as inflammatory/nociceptive pain. \n\n Table B. mPGES-1 inhibitory effect (IC\n50\n values in nM) of compounds in the cell assay \n\n\nIC50 IC50 IC50 IC50 example [nM] example [nM] example [nM] example [nM]\n\n\n1 <1 26 1 1 51 <1 76 2\n\n\n2 3 27 124 52 <1 77 12\n\n\n3 1 28 1 53 1 78 8\n\n\n4 2 29 <1 54 <1 79 1\n\n\n5 <1 30 <1 55 <1 80 7\n\n\n6 2 31 1 56 3 81 50\n\n\n7 1 32 1 57 <1 82 43\n\n\n8 <1 33 <1 58 2 \n\n\n 9 79 34 1 59 <1 84 <1\n\n\n10 4 35 <1 60 <1 85 4\n\n\n11 4 36 <1 61 <1 86 <1\n\n\n12 7 37 9 62 1 87 221\n\n\n13 28 38 <1 63 1 88 68\n\n\n14 5 39 <1 64 <1 \n\n\n 15 1 1 40 <1 65 6 90 36\n\n\n16 106 41 1 66 <1 91 10\n\n\n17 1 42 <1 67 1 92 9\n\n\n18 4 43 4 68 1 93 66\n\n\n19 2 44 1 69 3 \n\n\n 20 14 45 <1 70 16 95 13\n\n\n21 36 46 1 71 16 96 14\n\n\n22 1 47 <1 72 9 \n\n\n 23 <1 48 1 73 1 98 2 \n\n\n 49 1 74 1 \n\n\n 25 9 50 1 75 <1 100 52 \n\n IC50 IC50 IC50 IC50 example [nM] example [nM] example [nM] example [nM]\n\n\n101 1 1 126 72 151 1 176 <1\n\n\n102 15 127 85 152 <1 177 <1\n\n\n103 18 128 26 153 3 178 <1 \n\n\n 154 36 179 <1\n\n\n130 3 155 2 180 93\n\n\n131 1 156 10 \n\n\n 107 106 132 2 \n\n\n 108 59 133 1 158 <1 \n\n\n 109 57 134 8 159 1 \n\n\n 110 8 135 <1 160 <1 \n\n\n 111 7 136 17 161 2 \n\n\n 112 19 137 4 162 <1 \n\n\n 113 25 138 49 163 5 \n\n\n 139 27 164 15 \n\n\n 115 300 165 <1 \n\n\n 16 3 141 <1 166 7 \n\n\n 17 20 142 2.5 167 6 \n\n\n 18 1 1 168 <1 \n\n\n 144 2 169 1 \n\n\n 20 9 145 7 170 <1 \n\n\n 21 1 19 146 2 171 4 \n\n\n 22 4 147 4 172 2 \n\n\n 23 3 148 2 \n\n\n 24 28 149 1 174 <1 \n\n\n 25 220 150 1 \n\n Table C.
