WOODWARD, \n\n\n JENNY W. WANG AND JUSSI J. KANGASMETSA \n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS \n\n\nThis Application is related to US Patent Application Serial No. 61/375,406, filed on August 20, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates to compounds, to processes for their preparation, to \n\n\npharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in medicine, in particular their use in the treatment of conditions mediated by the action of ligands for the DPi, FP, TP, EPi EP\n3\n and EP\n4\n prostaglandin (PG) receptors. The present compounds have the general structure shown below and act at different prostaglandin receptors to thereby provide a general anti- inflammatory response. \n\n\nBackground of the Related Art \n\n\nThe EPi receptor is a 7-transmembrane receptor and its natural ligand is the prostaglandin PGE\n2\n. PGE\n2\n also has affinity for the other EP receptors (types EP\n2\n, EP\n3\n and\n\n\nEP\n4\n). The EPi receptor is associated with smooth muscle contraction, pain (in particular inflammatory, neuropathic and visceral), inflammation, allergic activities, renal regulation and gastric or enteric mucus secretion. Prostaglandin E\n2\n (PGE\n2\n) exerts allodynia through the EPi receptor subtype and hyperalgesia through EP\n2\n and EP\n3\n receptors in the mouse spinal cord. Furthermore, it has been shown that in the EPi knockout mouse pain-sensitivity responses are reduced by \n\n approximately 50%. EPi receptor antagonist (ONO-8711) reduces hyperalgesia and allodynia in a rat model of chronic constriction injury and inhibits mechanical hyperalgesia in a rodent model of post-operative pain. The efficacy of EPi receptor antagonists in the treatment of visceral pain in a human model of hypersensitivity has been demonstrated. Thus, selective prostaglandin ligands, agonists or antagonists, depending on which prostaglandin E receptor subtype is being considered, have anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic properties similar to a conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and in addition, inhibit hormone-induced uterine contractions and have anti-cancer effects. These compounds have a diminished ability to induce some of the mechanism-based side effects of NSAIDs, which are indiscriminate cyclooxygenase inhibitors. In particular, the compounds have a reduced potential for cardiovascular toxicity, a reduced effect on bleeding times and a lessened ability to induce asthma attacks in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic subjects. Moreover, as a result of sparing potentially beneficial prostaglandin pathways, these agents may have enhanced efficacy over NSAIDS and/or COX-2 inhibitors. (See Pub. No. US 2005/0065200 for other diseases that may be treated by EP4 receptor antagonists which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.) \n\n\nEP\n3\n receptors have been implicated in pain and hyperalgesia and hypepyrexia. Thus, EP\n3\n antagonists may be useful for treating pain, inflammation and fever. Additional uses include treatment of pre-term labor, over-active bladder disorders, cancer and cardiovascular disease. \n\n\nThe TP (also known as TxA\n2\n) receptor is a prostanoid receptor subtype stimulated by the endogenous mediator thromboxane. Activation of this receptor results in various physiological actions primarily incurred by its platelet aggregatory and smooth muscle constricting effects, thus opposing those of prostacyclin receptor activation. \n\n\nTP receptors have been identified in human kidneys in the glomerulus and \n\n\nextraglomerular vascular tissue. Activation of TP receptors constricts glomerular capillaries and suppresses glomerular filtration rates indicating that TP receptor antagonists could be useful for renal dysfunction in glomerulonephritis, diabetes mellitus and sepsis. \n\n Activation of TP receptors induces bronchoconstriction, an increase in microvascular permeability, formation of mucosal edema and mucus secretion, which are typical characteristic features of bronchial asthma. TP antagonists have been investigated as potential asthma treatments resulting in, for example, orally active Seratrodast (AA-2414). Ramatroban is another TP receptor antagonist currently undergoing phase III clinical trials as an anti-asthmatic compound. \n\n\nSince the DPi receptor may trigger an asthmatic response in certain individuals, compounds that have DPi antagonist properties may be useful as anti-asthmatic drugs. (See Pub. No. 2004/0162323 for the disclosure of other diseases and conditions that may be treated with DP antagonists.) Finally, the FP receptor modulates intraocular pressure and mediates smooth muscle contraction of the sphincter muscles in the gastrointestinal tract and the uterus. Thus, antagonists of the FP receptor are useful for treating reproductive disorders. (See US Patent No. 6,511 ,999 for other diseases and conditions that may be treated with FP receptor antagonists.) \n\n\nSummary of the Invention \n\n\nThis invention provides compounds, that are N-alkyl-2-(l-(2-(3-oxo-3- (trifluoromethylsulfonamido)propyl)benzyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl)oxazole-4-carboxamides, e.g. N- alkyl-2-( 1 -(5 -substituted-2-(3 -oxo-3 -(trifluoromethylsulfonamido)propyl)benzyl)pyrrolidin- 2-yl)oxazole-4-carboxamides wherein the 5 substituent is selected from the group consisting of halo and alkyloxy radicals.

Stable cell lines over-expressing human prostanoid DPi, EPi_\n4\n, FP, IP, and TP receptors were established as follows: \n\n\nBriefly, human prostanoid DPi, EP\n2\n, and EP\n4\n receptor cDNAs were co-trans fected with chimeric G\nqs\n cDNA containing a haemagglutanin (HA) epitope; human prostanoid EP\n3\n receptors were co-transfected with chimeric G\nq\ni-HA; human EPi, FP, IP, and TP receptor cDNAs were expressed with no exogenous G-proteins. G\nqs\n and G\nq\ni chimeric cDNAs (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, U.S.A.), as well as cDNAs of prostanoid receptors, were cloned into a pCEP\n4\n vector with a hygromycin B selection marker. Transfection into HEK-293 EBNA (Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen) cells was achieved by the FuGENE 6 transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Stable transfectants were selected according to hygromycin resistance. Because G\nqs\n and G\nq\ni contained an HA epitope, G-protein expression was detected by Western blotting analysis using anti-mouse HA monoclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody, while functional expression of prostanoid receptors was detected by FLIPR screening. These stable cell lines were validated using previously published antagonists at ΙΟμΜ against serial dilutions of standard agonists by FLIPR functional assays for Ca\n2+\n Signaling (as described below). \n\n\nCa\n2+\n signaling studies were performed using a FLIPR TETRA system (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in the 384-format. This is a high-throughput instrument for cell-based assays to monitor Ca\n2+\n signaling associated with GPCRs and ion channels. Cells were seeded at a density of 5 x 10\n4\n cells/well in BioCoat poly-D-lysine coated, black wall, clear bottom 384-well plates (BD Biosciences, Franklin lakes, NJ, USA) and allowed to attach overnight in an incubator at 37°C. The cells were then washed twice with HBSS- HEPES buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution without bicarbonate and phenol red, 20mM HEPES, pH 7.4) using an ELx405 Select CW Microplate Washer (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). After 60 min of dye-loading in the dark using the Ca\n2+\n-sensitive dye Fluo-4AM\n\n\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), at a final concentration of 2 x 10\n~6\nM, the plates were washed 4 times with HBSS-HEPES buffer to remove excess dye and leaving 50μ1 of buffer in each well. The plates were then placed in the FLIPR TETRA instrument and allowed to \n\n equilibrate at 37°C. AGN-211377 was added in a 25μ1 volume to each well to give final concentrations of Ο. ΙμΜ, 0.3μΜ, ΙμΜ, 3μΜ, ΙΟμΜ, and 30μΜ; or 0.067μΜ, Ο. ΙμΜ, 0.2μΜ, 0.3μΜ, 0.67μΜ, and ΙμΜ for cells over-expressing TP receptors. \n\n\n After 4.5 minutes, a 7-point serial dilution of the standard agonist for the corresponding receptor, in a 25 μΐ volume was injected at the final concentrations from 10\n\"\n \nU\nM to 10\n\"5\nM in 10-fold serial dilution increments for cells expressing human recombinant DPi, EPi, EP\n2\n, EP\n3\n, EP\n4\n, FP, and IP receptors. The dose range for the standard agonist for human recombinant TP receptors was from 10\n\"12\nM to 10\n\"6\nM. HBSS-HEPES buffer was used as the negative control for the standard agonists. Cells were excited with LED (light emitting diode) excitation at 470-495nm and emission was measured through an emission filter at 515- 575nm. Assay plates were read for 3.5 minutes using the FLIPR\nTETRA\n. The peak increase m fluorescence intensity was recorded for each well. On each plate, negative controls, dose response of positive controls, and co-treatments of antagonist-agonist for each dose were in triplicates. Standard agonists were as follows: DP =BW 245C, EPi-EP\n4\n =PGE\n2\n, FP =17- phenyl-PGF\n2a\n, IP =Cicaprost, and TP =U-46619. The peak fluorescence change in each well containing drug was expressed relative to vehicle controls with the standard agonist at 10\n\"6\nM (the positive control). To obtain concentration-response curves, compounds were tested in triplicate in each plate over the desired concentration range. Ca\n2+\n Signal Studies on Human Recombinant Prostanoid Receptor DP\n2\n \n\n\nFLIPR functional assays were conducted to monitor the activity anti-asthmatic against human DP\n2\n receptors stably expressed in the Chem-5 proprietary host cell line generated by Millipore. Prior to standard agonist addition, the compounds were spotted at ΙΟμΜ along with vehicle control (1% Ethanol in HBSS-HEPES buffer) across the assay wells. The assay plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes in the dark. Then an 8-point serial dilution dose response from 10\n\"12\nM to 10\n\"5\nM of the standard agonist PGD\n2\n was performed. Assay plates were read for 90 seconds using the FLIPPv\nTETRA\n The fluorescence measurements were collected to calculate IC\n50\n values. The assays were done at least 3 times to give n=3. \n\n All plates were subjected to appropriate baseline corrections. Maximum fluorescence values were exported. The raw data of n=l was first processed by Activity Base using nonlinear regression curve fit to calculate the percentage activity of each data point relative to the positive control (=10\n~6\nM of the standard agonist). Then n=3 of this data were exported to GraphPad Prism 4 to calculate the average EC\n50\n of the standard agonist, and the IC\n50\n (the concentration of the antagonist required to inhibit half the standard agonist activity) were calculated using nonlinear regression curve fit, with constraints of bottom constant equal to 0 and top constant equal to 100. Calculation of Kb = [Antagonist Concentration]/ (IC\n50\n/EC\n50\n- 1). When no antagonism was detected or when Kb >10,000nM, the antagonist is defined as not active (N A). \n\n\nThe results of the above testing are reported in TABLE 1 , below. \n\n\nTable 1. EC50 (nM) on Prostanoid Receptor Functional Activity Measured by FLIPR \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (FLIPR) K\nb\n (nM), NA = inactive \n\n\nAs shown in TABLE 1 , the preferred compounds of this invention are pan antagonists having particular activity at the FP, DP, EP\nls\n EP\n3\n, EP\n4\n and TP receptors, but are much less active at the EP\n2\n and IP receptors. Thus, these compounds have a biological selectivity profile making them useful in treating diseases and conditions which are mediated by the FP, \n\n DP, EPi, EP\n3\n, EP\n4\n and TP receptors, without the potential side effects and biological limitations associated with IP and EP\n2\n receptor blockade.
