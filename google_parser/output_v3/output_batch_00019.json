Field of the Invention\n\n\nThe invention relates to targeted binding agents against KDR and uses of such agents. More specifically, the invention relates to fully human monoclonal antibodies directed to KDR. The described targeted binding agents are useful in the treatment of diseases associated with the activity and/or overproduction of KDR and as diagnostics.\n\n\n2. Description of the Related Art\n\n\nThe vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) plays a critical role in inducing vascular growth and remodeling during development, and in a number of pathological conditions including the angiogenesis required to support solid tumour growth. VEGF-A signaling is predominantly mediated through activation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2; KDR/flk-1), which can stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, vascular permeability, and neovascular survival (reviewed in Olsson et al., Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7:359-71.). The broader VEGFR family of tyrosine kinase receptors consists of three members: VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3, also known as Flt-1, KDR/Flk-1 and Flt4, respectively. Known VEGFR ligands exhibit differential, well-defined selectivity for each VEGFR. For example, VEGF-A binds both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, VEGF-B and P1GF primarily bind VEGFR1, and VEGF-C and D are specific activators of VEGFR3. There are also a number of non-physiological VEGFs that also activate the VEGFR, for example VEGF-E specifically activates VEGFR2 while VEGF-F will activate VEGFR1 and VEGFR2.\n\n\nDimerization of VEGFR drives a complex series of signaling events leading to activation of many common growth factor signaling pathways (Olsson et al Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7:359-71). At the molecular level, there is a complex relationship between ligand expression, receptor dimerization and activation, and the downstream consequences in different cell types. VEGFR signaling is of primary importance to endothelial cells, although the receptors have been implicated in regulating the function of other cells. For example Flt-1 plays a role in mediating monocyte transmigration and, when expressed, can promote tumour cell migration.\n\n\nAll three receptors form both homo- and heterodimers (with the exception of VEGFR1/3 heterodimers), allowing signals from the various VEGF ligands to be integrated. KDR appears to be the receptor that is central to many of these signaling events, as it is the common VEGFR expressed on blood and lymphatic vessels. KDR can also offset low VEGFR-1 signaling activity. VEGFR1 itself has low intrinsic kinase activity, and deletion of the VEGFR1 kinase domain does not affect normal development. Experiments have shown that VEGFR1 can synergize with KDR and facilitate full activation of KDR signaling (Carmeliet et al, Nat Med 2001, 7, 575; Auterio et al, 2003 Nat Med, 9, 936). It is possible that this is achieved through heterodimerisation, which is prevented by an inhibitor of KDR dimerization. VEGFR3 has also been shown to form a heterodimer with KDR (Alam et al, BBRC, 2004, 324, 909). However, the mechanisms by which the various homo- and heterodimers of VEGFR1, KDR and VEGFR3 interact to drive physiological effects is unclear. Inhibition of VEGFR/VEGF signaling may effect different disease states (reviewed in Baka et al Expert Opin Ther Targets 2006, 10, 867).\n\n\nVEGFRs consist of seven immunoglobin-like extracellular domains. Ligands, (e.g. VEGFA and P1GF) that specifically bind VEGFRs have immunoglobin-\n \nlike domains\n \n 2 and 3, with \ndomain\n 2 making the primary contact and \ndomain\n 3 determining the specificity of binding (Christinger et al JBC, 2004, 279, 10382; Fuh et al JBC 1998, 273, 11197). In contrast, domains 4-6 are involved in dimerization of the receptor complexes. Ligand binding that stabilizes the receptor complexes can prolong dimerization, allowing productive signaling to proceed. As receptor activation is a function of both binding and dimerization, receptor activation can be inhibited by inhibiting ligand-receptor binding or by blocking dimerization. Antibodies that block binding of ligand to the receptors have been described previously, for example, IMC1121b and its murine equivalent, DC101, both of which block binding of VEGF-A to KDR, and thereby block VEGF-A signaling through KDR, and are known to deliver an anti-tumour effect (Prewett et al Cancer Res 1999, 59, 5209; Lu et al, JBC 2003, 278, 43496). It has been reported both pre-clinically and clinically that as a direct consequence of inhibiting KDR signaling, there is a rebound increase in circulating VEGF-A levels. Antibodies such as IMC1121b which block VEGF-A binding to KDR are expected to be less efficacious under conditions of increasing VEGF-A concentrations, where competition for binding to KDR may be won over by VEGF-A rather than the antibody.\n\n\nThus there is a need to identify new means of inhibiting KDR signaling.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to targeted binding agents that specifically bind to KDR and inhibit the biological activity of KDR. Embodiments of the invention relate to targeted binding agents that specifically bind to KDR and inhibit receptor dimerisation. Embodiments of the invention also relate to targeted binding agents that specifically bind to KDR and inhibit binding of VEGF to KDR. Embodiments of the invention relate to fully human isolated targeted binding agents that specifically bind to KDR and inhibit binding of VEGF to KDR Inhibition of KDR signaling by inhibition of receptor dimerisation is expected to have advantages over inhibition of VEGF-A binding to KDR. Targeted binding agents which inhibit receptor dimerisation, such as those described here, are anticipated to be able to maximally inhibit the KDR signaling axis by blocking KDR:KDR homodimer and KDR:Flt-1 heterodimer formation and hence block VEGF-A, VEGF-B and P1GF signaling through both KDR and Flt-1. In addition, increasing VEGF-A levels should have no direct impact on the efficacy of agents that inhibit receptor dimerization.\n\n\nEmbodiments of the invention relate to targeted binding agents that specifically bind to KDR and inhibit receptor dimerisation.

For example, amino acid substitutions and/or deletions can be generated by mutagenesis methods, including, but not limited to, site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n82:488-492 (1985)), PCR mutagenesis (Higuchi, in “PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications”, Academic Press, San Diego, pp. 177-183 (1990)), and cassette mutagenesis (Wells et al., Gene 34:315-323 (1985)). Preferably, site-directed mutagenesis is performed by the overlap-extension PCR method (Higuchi, in “PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification”, Stockton Press, New York, pp. 61-70 (1989)). The technique of overlap-extension PCR (Higuchi, ibid.) can also be used to introduce any desired mutation(s) into a target sequence (the starting DNA). For example, the first round of PCR in the overlap-extension method involves amplifying the target sequence with an outside primer (primer 1) and an internal mutagenesis primer (primer 3), and separately with a second outside primer (primer 4) and an internal primer (primer 2), yielding two PCR segments (segments A and B). The internal mutagenesis primer (primer 3) is designed to contain mismatches to the target sequence specifying the desired mutation(s). In the second round of PCR, the products of the first round of PCR (segments A and B) are amplified by PCR using the two outside primers (primers 1 and 4). The resulting full-length PCR segment (segment C) is digested with restriction enzymes and the resulting restriction fragment is cloned into an appropriate vector. As the first step of mutagenesis, the starting DNA (e.g., encoding an Fc fusion protein, an antibody or simply an Fc region), is operably cloned into a mutagenesis vector. The primers are designed to reflect the desired amino acid substitution. Other methods useful for the generation of variant Fc regions are known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat.

In some embodiments, an Fc variant protein comprises one or more engineered glycoforms, i.e., a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to the molecule comprising an Fc region.

technical terms used herein shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. Generally, nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and techniques of, cell and tissue culture, molecular biology, and protein and oligo- or polynucleotide chemistry and hybridization described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art.\n\n\nStandard techniques are used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, and tissue culture and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are performed according to manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The foregoing techniques and procedures are generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification. See e.g., Sambrook et al. \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual \n(3rd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (2001)), which is incorporated herein by reference. The nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques are used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.\n\n\nAs utilized in accordance with the present disclosure, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:\n\n\nAn antagonist or inhibitor may be a polypeptide, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, lipid, small molecular weight compound, an oligonucleotide, an oligopeptide, RNA interference (RNAi), antisense, a recombinant protein, an antibody, or fragments thereof or conjugates or fusion proteins thereof. For a review of RNAi see Milhavet O, Gary D S, Mattson M P. (Pharmacol Rev. 2003 December; 55(4):629-48. Review) and antisense (see Opalinska J B, Gewirtz A M. (Sci STKE. 2003 Oct. 28; 2003 (206):pe47.)\n\n\nDisease-related cell adhesion and/or invasion and/or angiogenesis and/or proliferation may be any abnormal, undesirable or pathological cell adhesion and/or invasion and/or angiogenesis and/or proliferation, for example tumour-related cell adhesion and/or invasion and/or angiogenesis and/or proliferation. Cell adhesion- and/or invasion and/or angiogenesis- and/or proliferation-related diseases include, but are not limited to, non-solid tumours such as leukemia, multiple myeloma or lymphoma, and also solid tumours such as melanoma, small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, glioma, hepatocellular (liver) carcinoma, glioblastoma, carcinoma of the thyroid, bile duct, bone, gastric, brain/CNS, head and neck, hepatic system, stomach, prostate, breast, renal, testicle, ovary, skin, cervix, lung, muscle, neuron, esophageal, bladder, lung, uterus, vulva, endometrium, kidney, colorectum, pancreas, pleural/peritoneal membranes, salivary gland, and epidermous.\n\n\nA compound refers to any small molecular weight compound with a molecular weight of less than about 2000 Daltons.\n\n\nThe term “KDR” refers to the molecule that is KDR protein, also known as VEGFR2 and KDR receptor-like tyrosine kinase.\n\n\nThe terms “neutralizing” or “inhibits” when referring to a targeted binding agent, such as an antibody, relates to the ability of an antibody to eliminate, reduce, or significantly reduce, the activity of a target antigen. Accordingly, a “neutralizing” anti-KDR antibody of the invention is capable of eliminating or significantly reducing the activity of KDR. A neutralizing KDR antibody may, for example, act by blocking the binding of a native KDR-specific ligand, such as, for example, VEGF, to KDR. By blocking this binding, KDR signal-mediated activity is significantly, or completely, eliminated. Ideally, a neutralizing antibody against KDR inhibits cell adhesion and/or invasion and/or angiogenesis and/or proliferation.\n\n\nAn “antagonist of the biological activity of KDR” is capable of eliminating, reducing or significantly reducing the activity of KDR. An “antagonist of the biological activity of KDR” is capable of eliminating, reducing or significantly reducing KDR signaling. An “antagonist of the biological activity of KDR” may eliminate or significantly reduce cell adhesion and/or invasion and/or angiogenesis and/or proliferation.\n\n\n“Reducing KDR signaling” encompasses a reduction of KDR signaling by at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95% in comparison with the level of signaling in the absence of a targeted binding agent, antibody or antagonist of the invention.\n\n\nThe term “polypeptide” is used herein as a generic term to refer to native protein, fragments, or analogs of a polypeptide sequence. Hence, native protein, fragments, and analogs are species of the polypeptide genus. Preferred polypeptides in accordance with the invention comprise the human heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules and the human kappa light chain immunoglobulin molecules, as well as antibody molecules formed by combinations comprising the heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules with light chain immunoglobulin molecules, such as the kappa or lambda light chain immunoglobulin molecules, and vice versa, as well as fragments and analogs thereof. Preferred polypeptides in accordance with the invention may also comprise solely the human heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules or fragments thereof.\n\n\nThe terms “native” or “naturally-occurring” as used herein as applied to an object refers to the fact that an object can be found in nature. For example, a polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory or otherwise is naturally-occurring.\n\n\nThe term “operably linked” as used herein refers to positions of components so described that are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. For example, a control sequence “operably linked” to a coding sequence is connected in such a way that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the control sequences.\n\n\nThe term “polynucleotide” as referred to herein means a polymeric form of nucleotides of at least 10 bases in length, either ribonucleotides or deoxynucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide, or RNA-DNA hetero-duplexes. The term includes single and double stranded forms of DNA.\n\n\nThe term “oligonucleotide” referred to herein includes naturally occurring, and modified nucleotides linked together by naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring linkages. Oligonucleotides are a polynucleotide subset generally comprising a length of 200 bases or fewer. Preferably, oligonucleotides are 10 to 60 bases in length and most preferably 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 to 40 bases in length. Oligonucleotides are usually single stranded, e.g. for probes; although oligonucleotides may be double stranded, e.g. for use in the construction of a gene mutant. Oligonucleotides can be either sense or antisense oligonucleotides.\n\n\nThe term “naturally occurring nucleotides” referred to herein includes deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides. The term “modified nucleotides” referred to herein includes nucleotides with modified or substituted sugar groups and the like. The term “oligonucleotide linkages” referred to herein includes oligonucleotides linkages such as phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate, phosphoraniladate, phosphoroamidate, and the like. See e.g., LaPlanche et al. \nNucl. Acids Res. \n14:9081 (1986); Stec et al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n106:6077 (1984); Stein et al. \nNucl. Acids Res. \n16:3209 (1988); Zon et al. \nAnti\n-\nCancer Drug Design \n6:539 (1991); Zon et al. \nOligonucleotides and Analogues: A Practical Approach\n, pp. 87-108 (F. Eckstein, Ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford England (1991)); Stec et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,151,510; Uhlmann and Peyman \nChemical Reviews \n90:543 (1990), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. An oligonucleotide can include a label for detection, if desired.\n\n\nThe term “selectively hybridise” referred to herein means to detectably and specifically bind. Polynucleotides, oligonucleotides and fragments thereof selectively hybridise to nucleic acid strands under hybridisation and wash conditions that minimise appreciable amounts of detectable binding to nonspecific nucleic acids. High stringency conditions can be used to achieve selective hybridisation conditions as known in the art and discussed herein. Generally, the nucleic acid sequence homology between the polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, or antibody fragments and a nucleic acid sequence of interest will be at least 80%, and more typically with preferably increasing homologies of at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, and 100%.\n\n\nStringent hybridization conditions include, but are not limited to, hybridization to filter-bound DNA in 6× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) (0.9 M NaCl/90 mM NaCitrate, pH 7.0) at about 45° C. followed by one or more washes in 0.2×SSC/0.1% SDS at about 50-65° C., highly stringent conditions such as hybridization to filter-bound DNA in 6×SSC at about 45° C. followed by one or more washes in 0.1×SSC/0.2% SDS at about 60° C., or any other stringent hybridization conditions known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, Ausubel, F. M. et al.,  eds. 1989 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, vol. 1, Green Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley and Sons, Inc., NY at pages 6.3.1 to 6.3.6 and 2.10.3). Two amino acid sequences are “homologous” if there is a partial or complete identity between their sequences. For example, 85% homology means that 85% of the amino acids are identical when the two sequences are aligned for maximum matching. Gaps (in either of the two sequences being matched) are allowed in maximizing matching; gap lengths of 5 or less are preferred with 2 or less being more preferred. Alternatively and preferably, two protein sequences (or polypeptide sequences derived from them of at least about 30 amino acids in length) are homologous, as this term is used herein, if they have an alignment score of more than 5 (in standard deviation units) using the program ALIGN with the mutation data matrix and a gap penalty of 6 or greater. See Dayhoff, M. O., in \nAtlas of Protein Sequence and Structure\n, pp. 101-110 (Volume 5, National Biomedical Research Foundation (1972)) and \nSupplement\n 2 to this volume, pp. 1-10. The two sequences or parts thereof are more preferably homologous if their amino acids are greater than or equal to 50% identical when optimally aligned using the ALIGN program. It should be appreciated that there can be differing regions of homology within two orthologous sequences. For example, the functional sites of mouse and human orthologues may have a higher degree of homology than non-functional regions.\n\n\nThe term “corresponds to” is used herein to mean that a polynucleotide sequence is homologous (i.e., is identical, not strictly evolutionarily related) to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence, or that a polypeptide sequence is identical to a reference polypeptide sequence.\n\n\nIn contradistinction, the term “complementary to” is used herein to mean that the complementary sequence is homologous to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence. For illustration, the nucleotide sequence “TATAC” corresponds to a reference sequence “TATAC” and is complementary to a reference sequence “GTATA”.\n\n\nThe term “sequence identity” means that two polynucleotide or amino acid sequences are identical (i.e., on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide or residue-by-residue basis) over the comparison window. The term “percentage of sequence identity” is calculated by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over the window of comparison, determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base (e.g., A, T, C, G, U, or I) or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the comparison window (i.e., the window size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. The terms “substantial identity” as used herein denotes a characteristic of a polynucleotide or amino acid sequence, wherein the polynucleotide or amino acid comprises a sequence that has at least 85 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 to 95 percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 99 percent sequence identity, as compared to a reference sequence over a comparison window of at least 18 nucleotide (6 amino acid) positions, frequently over a window of at least 24-48 nucleotide (8-16 amino acid) positions, wherein the percentage of sequence identity is calculated by comparing the reference sequence to the sequence which may include deletions or additions which total 20 percent or less of the reference sequence over the comparison window. The reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence.\n\n\nAs used herein, the twenty conventional amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage. See \nImmunology—A Synthesis \n(2\nnd \nEdition, E. S. Golub and D. R. Gren, Eds., Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Mass. (1991)), which is incorporated herein by reference. Stereoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino acids such as α-,α-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino acids may also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present invention. Examples of unconventional amino acids include: 4-hydroxyproline, γ-carboxyglutamate, ε-N,N,N-trimethyllysine, ε-N-acetyllysine, O-phosphoserine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine, σ-N-methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and imino acids (e.g., 4-hydroxyproline). In the polypeptide notation used herein, the left-hand direction is the amino terminal direction and the right-hand direction is the carboxy-terminal direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention.\n\n\nSimilarly, unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5′ end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5′ direction. The direction of 5′ to 3′ addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5′ to the 5′ end of the RNA transcript are referred to as “upstream sequences”; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3′ to the 3′ end of the RNA transcript are referred to as “downstream sequences”.\n\n\nAs applied to polypeptides, the term “substantial identity” means that two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 80 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 95 percent sequence identity, and most preferably at least 99 percent sequence identity. Preferably, residue positions that are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains. For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains is serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is lysine, arginine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur-containing side chains is cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, glutamic-aspartic, and asparagine-glutamine.\n\n\nAs discussed herein, minor variations in the amino acid sequences of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules are contemplated as being encompassed by the present invention, providing that the variations in the amino acid sequence maintain at least 75%, more preferably at least 80%, 90%, 95%, and most preferably 99% sequence identity to the antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules described herein. In particular, conservative amino acid replacements are contemplated. Conservative replacements are those that take place within a family of amino acids that have related side chains. Genetically encoded amino acids are generally divided into families: (1) acidic=aspartate, glutamate; (2) basic=lysine, arginine, histidine; (3) non-polar=alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan; and (4) uncharged polar=glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, serine, threonine, tyrosine. More preferred families are: serine and threonine are an aliphatic-hydroxy family; asparagine and glutamine are an amide-containing family; alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine are an aliphatic family; and phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are an aromatic family. For example, it is reasonable to expect that an isolated replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, a threonine with a serine, or a similar replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid will not have a major effect on the binding function or properties of the resulting molecule, especially if the replacement does not involve an amino acid within a framework site. Whether an amino acid change results in a functional peptide can readily be determined by assaying the specific activity of the polypeptide derivative. Assays are described in detail herein. Fragments or analogs of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in the art. Preferred amino- and carboxy-termini of fragments or analogs occur near boundaries of functional domains. Structural and functional domains can be identified by comparison of the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequence databases. Preferably, computerized comparison methods are used to identify sequence motifs or predicted protein conformation domains that occur in other proteins of known structure and/or function. Methods to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional structure are known. Bowie et al. \nScience \n253:164 (1991). Thus, the foregoing examples demonstrate that those of skill in the art can recognize sequence motifs and structural conformations that may be used to define structural and functional domains in accordance with the antibodies described herein.\n\n\nGlutaminyl and asparaginyl residues are frequently deamidated to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues, respectively. These residues are deamidated under neutral or basic conditions. The deamidated form of these residues falls within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nIn general, cysteine residues in proteins are either engaged in cysteine-cysteine disulfide bonds or sterically protected from the disulfide bond formation when they are a part of folded protein region. Disulfide bond formation in proteins is a complex process, which is determined by the redox potential of the environment and specialized thiol-disulfide exchanging enzymes (Creighton, Methods Enzymol. 107, 305-329, 1984; Houee-Levin, Methods Enzymol. 353, 35-44,2002). When a cysteine residue does not have a pair in protein structure and is not sterically protected by folding, it can form a disulfide bond with a free cysteine from solution in a process known as disulfide shuffling. In another process known as disulfide scrambling, free cysteines may also interfere with naturally occurring disulfide bonds (such as those present in antibody structures) and lead to low binding, low biological activity and/or low stability.\n\n\nPreferred amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and (4) confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties of such analogs. Analogs can include various mutations of a sequence other than the naturally-occurring peptide sequence. For example, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (preferably conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (preferably in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts. A conservative amino acid substitution should not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in \nProteins, Structures and Molecular Principles \n(Creighton, Ed., W.H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984)); \nIntroduction to Protein Structure \n(C. Branden and J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991)); and Thornton et al. \nNature \n354:105 (1991), which are each incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nAdditionally, such methods may be used to make amino acid substitutions or deletions of one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond to generate antibody molecules lacking one or more intrachain disulfide bonds.\n\n\nThe term “CDR region” or “CDR” is intended to indicate the hypervariable regions of the heavy and light chains of an antibody which confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. CDRs may be defined according to the Kabat system (Kabat, E. A. et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Edition. US Department of Health and Human Services, Public Service, NIH, Washington), and later editions. An antibody typically contains 3 heavy chain CDRs and 3 light chain CDRs. The term CDR or CDRs is used here in order to indicate, according to the case, one of these regions or several, or even the whole, of these regions which contain the majority of the amino acid residues responsible for the binding by affinity of the antibody for the antigen or the epitope which it recognises.\n\n\nThe third CDR of the heavy chain (HCDR3) has a greater size variability (greater diversity essentially due to the mechanisms of arrangement of the genes which give rise to it). It may be as short as 2 amino acids although the longest size known is 26. CDR length may also vary according to the length that can be accommodated by the particular underlying framework. Functionally, HCDR3 plays a role in part in the determination of the specificity of the antibody (Segal et al., PNAS, 71:4298-4302, 1974, Amit et al., Science, 233:747-753, 1986, Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-917, 1987, Chothia et al., Nature, 342:877-883, 1989, Caton et al., J. Immunol., 144:1965-1968, 1990, Sharon et al., PNAS, 87:4814-4817, 1990, Sharon et al., J. Immunol., 144:4863-4869, 1990, Kabat et al., J. Immunol., 147:1709-1719, 1991).\n\n\nThe term a “set of CDRs” referred to herein comprises CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3. Thus, a set of HCDRs refers to HCDR1, HCDR2 and HCDR3, and a set of LCDRs refers to LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3.\n\n\nVariants of the VH and VL domains and CDRs of the present invention, including those for which amino acid sequences are set out herein, and which can be employed in targeting agents and antibodies for KDR can be obtained by means of methods of sequence alteration or mutation and screening for antigen targeting with desired characteristics. Examples of desired characteristics include but are not limited to: increased binding affinity for antigen relative to known antibodies which are specific for the antigen; increased neutralisation of an antigen activity relative to known antibodies which are specific for the antigen if the activity is known; specified competitive ability with a known antibody or ligand to the antigen at a specific molar ratio; ability to immunoprecipitate ligand-receptor complex; ability to bind to a specified epitope; linear epitope, e.g. peptide sequence identified using peptide-binding scan, e.g. using peptides screened in linear and/or constrained conformation; conformational epitope, formed by non-continuous residues; ability to modulate a new biological activity of KDR, or downstream molecule; ability to bind and/or neutralise KDR and/or for any other desired property.\n\n\nThe techniques required to make substitutions within amino acid sequences of CDRs, antibody VH or VL domains and antigen binding sites are available in the art. Variants of antibody molecules disclosed herein may be produced and used in the present invention. Following the lead of computational chemistry in applying multivariate data analysis techniques to the structure/property-activity relationships (Wold, et al. Multivariate data analysis in chemistry. Chemometrics—Mathematics and Statistics in Chemistry (Ed.: B. Kowalski), D. Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht, Holland, 1984) quantitative activity-property relationships of antibodies can be derived using well-known mathematical techniques, such as statistical regression, pattern recognition and classification (Norman et al. Applied Regression Analysis. Wiley-Interscience; 3rd edition (April 1998); Kandel, Abraham & Backer, Eric. Computer-Assisted Reasoning in Cluster Analysis. Prentice Hall PTR, (May 11, 1995); Krzanowski, Wojtek. Principles of Multivariate Analysis: A User's Perspective (Oxford Statistical Science Series, No 22 (Paper)). Oxford University Press; (December 2000); Witten, Ian H. & Frank, Eibe. Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations. Morgan Kaufmann; (Oct. 11, 1999); Denison David G. T. (Editor), Christopher C. Holmes, Bani K. Mallick, Adrian F. M. Smith. Bayesian Methods for Nonlinear Classification and Regression (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics). John Wiley & Sons; (July 2002); Ghose, Arup K. & Viswanadhan, Vellarkad N. Combinatorial Library Design and Evaluation Principles, Software, Tools, and Applications in Drug Discovery). In some cases the properties of antibodies can be derived from empirical and theoretical models (for example, analysis of likely contact residues or calculated physicochemical property) of antibody sequence, functional and three-dimensional structures and these properties can be considered singly and in combination.\n\n\nAn antibody antigen-binding site composed of a VH domain and a VL domain is typically formed by six loops of polypeptide: three from the light chain variable domain (VL) and three from the heavy chain variable domain (VH). Analysis of antibodies of known atomic structure has elucidated relationships between the sequence and three-dimensional structure of antibody combining sites. These relationships imply that, except for the third region (loop) in VH domains, binding site loops have one of a small number of main-chain conformations: canonical structures. The canonical structure formed in a particular loop has been shown to be determined by its size and the presence of certain residues at key sites in both the loop and in framework regions.\n\n\nThis study of sequence-structure relationship can be used for prediction of those residues in an antibody of known sequence, but of an unknown three-dimensional structure, which are important in maintaining the three-dimensional structure of its CDR loops and hence maintain binding specificity. These predictions can be backed up by comparison of the predictions to the output from lead optimisation experiments. In a structural approach, a model can be created of the antibody molecule using any freely available or commercial package, such as WAM. A protein visualisation and analysis software package, such as Insight II (Accelrys, Inc.) or Deep View may then be used to evaluate possible substitutions at each position in the CDR. This information may then be used to make substitutions likely to have a minimal or beneficial effect on activity or confer other desirable properties.\n\n\nThe term “polypeptide fragment” as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion, but where the remaining amino acid sequence is identical to the corresponding positions in the naturally-occurring sequence deduced, for example, from a full-length cDNA sequence. Fragments typically are at least 5, 6, 8 or 10 amino acids long, preferably at least 14 amino acids long, more preferably at least 20 amino acids long, usually at least 50 amino acids long, and even more preferably at least 70 amino acids long. The term “analog” as used herein refers to polypeptides which are comprised of a segment of at least 25 amino acids that has substantial identity to a portion of a deduced amino acid sequence and which has at least one of the following properties: (1) specific binding to KDR, under suitable binding conditions, (2) ability to block appropriate VEGF/KDR binding, or (3) ability to inhibit KDR receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Typically, polypeptide analogs comprise a conservative amino acid substitution (or addition or deletion) with respect to the naturally-occurring sequence. Analogs typically are at least 20 amino acids long, preferably at least 50 amino acids long or longer, and can often be as long as a full-length naturally-occurring polypeptide.\n\n\nPeptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound are termed “peptide mimetics” or “peptidomimetics” (Fauchere, \nJ. Adv. Drug Res. \n15:29 (1986); Veber and Freidinger \nTINS \np. 392 (1985); and Evans et al. \nJ. Med. Chem. \n30:1229 (1987), which are incorporated herein by reference). Such compounds are often developed with the aid of computerized molecular modeling. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce an equivalent therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biochemical property or pharmacological activity), such as human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from the group consisting of: —CH\n2\nNH—, —CH\n2\nS—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH═CH—(cis and trans), —COCH\n2\n—, —CH(OH)CH\n2\n—, and —CH\n2\nSO—, by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may be used to generate more stable peptides. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods known in the art (Rizo and Gierasch \nAnn. Rev. Biochem. \n61:387 (1992), incorporated herein by reference); for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.\n\n\nAn antibody may be oligoclonal, a polyclonal antibody, a monoclonal antibody, a chimeric antibody, a CDR-grafted antibody, a multi-specific antibody, a bi-specific antibody, a catalytic antibody, a chimeric antibody, a humanized antibody, a fully human antibody, an anti-idiotypic antibody and antibodies that can be labeled in soluble or bound form as well as fragments, variants or derivatives thereof, either alone or in combination with other amino acid sequences provided by known techniques. An antibody may be from any species.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms “antibody” and “antibodies” (immunoglobulins) encompass monoclonal antibodies (including full-length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, camelised antibodies and chimeric antibodies. As used herein, the term “antibody” or “antibodies” refers to a polypeptide or group of polypeptides that are comprised of at least one binding domain that is formed from the folding of polypeptide chains having three-dimensional binding spaces with internal surface shapes and charge distributions complementary to the features of an antigenic determinant of an antigen. chain. Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Light chains are classified as either lambda chains or kappa chains based on the amino acid sequence of the light chain constant region. The variable domain of a kappa light chain may also be denoted herein as VK. The term “variable region” may also be used to describe the variable domain of a heavy chain or light chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light and heavy chain variable domains. The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form an antibody binding site. Such antibodies may be derived from any mammal, including, but not limited to, humans, monkeys, pigs, horses, rabbits, dogs, cats, mice, etc.\n\n\nThe term “antibody” or “antibodies” includes binding fragments of the antibodies of the invention, exemplary fragments include single-chain Fvs (scFv), single-chain antibodies, single domain antibodies, domain antibodies, Fv fragments, Fab fragments, F(ab′) fragments, F(ab′)2 fragments, antibody fragments that exhibit the desired biological activity, disulfide-stabilised variable region (dsFv), dimeric variable region (Diabody), anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention), intrabodies, linear antibodies, single-chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. In particular, antibodies include immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active fragments of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen-binding site. Immunoglobulin molecules can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass.\n\n\nDigestion of antibodies with the enzyme, papain, results in two identical antigen-binding fragments, known also as “Fab” fragments, and a “Fc” fragment, having no antigen-binding activity but having the ability to crystallize. Digestion of antibodies with the enzyme, pepsin, results in the a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment in which the two arms of the antibody molecule remain linked and comprise two-antigen binding sites. The F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment has the ability to crosslink antigen.\n\n\n“Fv” when used herein refers to the minimum fragment of an antibody that retains both antigen-recognition and antigen-binding sites. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent or covalent association. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n\n“Fab” when used herein refers to a fragment of an antibody that comprises the constant domain of the light chain and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain.\n\n\n“dAb” when used herein refers to a fragment of an antibody that is the smallest functional binding unit of a human antibodies. A “dAb” is a single domain antibody and comprises either the variable domain of an antibody heavy chain (VH domain) or the variable domain of an antibody light chain (VL domain). Each dAb contains three of the six naturally occurring CDRs (Ward et al., Binding activities of a repertoire of single immunoglobulin variable domains secreted from \nEscherichia coli. Nature \n341, 544-546 (1989); Holt, et al., Domain antibodies: protein for therapy, \nTrends Biotechnol. \n21, 484-49 (2003)). With molecular weights ranging from 11 to 15 kDa, they are four times smaller than a fragment antigen binding (Fab)2 and half the size of a single chain Fv (scFv) molecule.\n\n\n“Camelid” when used herein refers to antibody molecules are composed of heavy-chain dimers which are devoid of light chains, but nevertheless have an extensive antigen-binding repertoire (Hamers-Casterman C, Atarhouch T, Muyldermans S, Robinson G, Hamers C, Songa E B, Bendahman N, Hamers R (1993) Naturally occurring antibodies devoid of light chains. Nature 363:446-448).\n\n\nThe term “diabodies” refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) connected to a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) in the same polypeptide chain (V\nH\n-V\nL\n). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Hollinger et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n90:6444-6448 (1993).\n\n\nIt has been shown that fragments of a whole antibody can perform the function of binding antigens. Examples of binding fragments are (Ward, E. S. et al., (1989) Nature 341, 544-546) the Fab fragment consisting of VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (McCafferty et al (1990) Nature, 348, 552-554) the Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (Holt et al (2003) Trends in Biotechnology 21, 484-490) the Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single antibody; (iv) the dAb fragment (Ward, E. S. et al., Nature 341, 544-546 (1989), McCafferty et al (1990) Nature, 348, 552-554, Holt et al (2003) Trends in Biotechnology 21, 484-490], which consists of a VH or a VL domain; (v) isolated CDR regions; (vi) F(ab′)2 fragments, a bivalent fragment comprising two linked Fab fragments (vii) single chain Fv molecules (scFv), wherein a VH domain and a VL domain are linked by a peptide linker which allows the two domains to associate to form an antigen binding site (Bird et al, (1988) Science, 242, 423-426, Huston et al, (1988) PNAS USA, 85, 5879-5883); (viii) bispecific single chain Fv dimers (PCT/US92/09965) and (ix) “diabodies”, multivalent or multispecific fragments constructed by gene fusion (WO94/13804; Holliger, P. (1993) et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 6444-6448,). Fv, scFv or diabody molecules may be stabilised by the incorporation of disulphide bridges linking the VH and VL domains (Reiter, Y. et al, Nature Biotech, 14, 1239-1245, 1996). Minibodies comprising a scFv joined to a CH3 domain may also be made (Hu, S. et al, (1996) Cancer Res., 56, 3055-3061). Other examples of binding fragments are Fab′, which differs from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxyl terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain, including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region, and Fab′-SH, which is a Fab′ fragment in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group.\n\n\nThe term “variable” refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are responsible for the binding specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed through the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in segments called Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of the variable domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a β-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the β-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see, Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The constant domains are generally not involved directly in antigen binding, but may influence antigen binding affinity and may exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in ADCC, CDC, and/or apoptosis.\n\n\nThe term “hypervariable region” when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are associated with its binding to antigen. The hypervariable regions encompass the amino acid residues of the “complementarity determining regions” or “CDRs” (e.g., residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) of the light chain variable domain and residues 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) of the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)) and/or those residues from a “hypervariable loop” (e.g., residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-917 (1987)). “Framework” or “FR” residues are those variable domain residues flanking the CDRs. FR residues are present in chimeric, humanized, human, domain antibodies, diabodies, vaccibodies, linear antibodies, and bispecific antibodies.\n\n\nAs used herein, targeted binding agent, targeted binding protein, specific binding protein and like terms refer to an antibody, or binding fragment thereof that preferentially binds to a target site. In one embodiment, the targeted binding agent is specific for only one target site. In other embodiments, the targeted binding agent is specific for more than one target site. In one embodiment, the targeted binding agent may be a monoclonal antibody and the target site may be an epitope.\n\n\n“Binding fragments” of an antibody are produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Binding fragments include Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv, dAb and single-chain antibodies. An antibody other than a “bispecific” or “bifunctional” antibody is understood to have each of its binding sites identical. An antibody substantially inhibits adhesion of a receptor to a counter-receptor when an excess of antibody reduces the quantity of receptor bound to counter-receptor by at least about 20%, 40%, 60% or 80%, and more usually greater than about 85% (as measured in an in vitro competitive binding assay).\n\n\nThe term “epitope” includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and may, but not always, have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. An antibody is said to specifically bind an antigen when the dissociation constant is ≦1 μM, preferably ≦100 nM and most preferably ≦10 nM.\n\n\nThe term “agent” is used herein to denote a chemical compound, a mixture of chemical compounds, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made from biological materials.\n\n\n“Active” or “activity” in regard to an KDR polypeptide refers to a portion of an KDR polypeptide that has a biological or an immunological activity of a native KDR polypeptide. “Biological” when used herein refers to a biological function that results from the activity of the native KDR polypeptide. A preferred KDR biological activity includes, for example, KDR induced cell adhesion and invasion and/or angiogenesis and/or proliferation.\n\n\n“Mammal” when used herein refers to any animal that is considered a mammal Preferably, the mammal is human.\n\n\n“Animal” when used herein encompasses animals considered a mammal Preferably the is animal is human.\n\n\nThe term “mAb” refers to monoclonal antibody.\n\n\n“Liposome” when used herein refers to a small vesicle that may be useful for delivery of drugs that may include the KDR polypeptide of the invention or antibodies to such an KDR polypeptide to a mammal\n\n\n“Label” or “labeled” as used herein refers to the addition of a detectable moiety to a polypeptide, for example, a radiolabel, fluorescent label, enzymatic label chemiluminescent labeled or a biotinyl group. Radioisotopes or radionuclides may include \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n35\nS, \n90\nY, \n99\nTc, \n111\nIn, \n125\nI, \n131\nI, fluorescent labels may include rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors or FITC and enzymatic labels may include horseradish peroxidase, β-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase.\n\n\nAdditional labels include, by way of illustration and not limitation: enzymes, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (“G6PDH”), alpha-D-galactosidase, glucose oxydase, glucose amylase, carbonic anhydrase, acetylcholinesterase, lysozyme, malate dehydrogenase and peroxidase; dyes; additional fluorescent labels or fluorescers include, such as fluorescein and its derivatives, fluorochrome, GFP (GFP for “Green Fluorescent Protein”), dansyl, umbelliferone, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaldehyde, and fluorescamine; fluorophores such as lanthanide cryptates and chelates e.g. Europium etc (Perkin Elmer and Cis Biointernational); chemoluminescent labels or chemiluminescers, such as isoluminol, luminol and the dioxetanes; sensitisers; coenzymes; enzyme substrates; particles, such as latex or carbon particles; metal sol; crystallite; liposomes; cells, etc., which may be further labelled with a dye, catalyst or other detectable group; molecules such as biotin, digoxygenin or 5-bromodeoxyuridine; toxin moieties, such as for example a toxin moiety selected from a group of \nPseudomonas \nexotoxin (PE or a cytotoxic fragment or mutant thereof), Diptheria toxin or a cytotoxic fragment or mutant thereof, a botulinum toxin A, B, C, D, E or F, ricin or a cytotoxic fragment thereof e.g. ricin A, abrin or a cytotoxic fragment thereof, saporin or a cytotoxic fragment thereof, pokeweed antiviral toxin or a cytotoxic fragment thereof and bryodin 1 or a cytotoxic fragment thereof.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutical agent or drug” as used herein refers to a chemical compound or composition capable of inducing a desired therapeutic effect when properly administered to a patient. Other chemistry terms herein are used according to conventional usage in the art, as exemplified by \nThe McGraw\n-\nHill Dictionary of Chemical Terms \n(Parker, S., Ed., McGraw-Hill, San Francisco (1985)), (incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nAs used herein, “substantially pure” means an object species is the predominant species present (i.e., on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other individual species in the composition), and preferably a substantially purified fraction is a composition wherein the object species comprises at least about 50 percent (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species present. Generally, a substantially pure composition will comprise more than about 80 percent of all macromolecular species present in the composition, more preferably more than about 85%, 90%, 95%, and 99%. Most preferably, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity (contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods) wherein the composition consists essentially of a single macromolecular species.\n\n\nThe term “patient” includes human and veterinary subjects.\n\n\n“Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity” and “ADCC” refer to a cell-mediated reaction in which non-specific cytotoxic cells that express Ig Fc receptors (FcRs) (e.g. Natural Killer (NK) cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages) recognise bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcγRIII only, whereas monocytes express FcγRI, FcγRII and FcγRIII. FcRs expression on hematopoietic cells is summarised in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, \nAnnu. Rev. Immunol \n9:457-92 (1991). To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362, or 5,821,337 can be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest can be assessed in vivo, e.g., in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. \nPNAS \n(\nUSA\n) 95:652-656 (1988). “Complement dependent cytotoxicity” and “CDC” refer to the mechanism by which antibodies carry out their cell-killing function. It is initiated by the binding of C1q, a constituent of the first component of complement, to the Fc domain of Igs, IgG or IgM, which are in complex with antigen (Hughs-Jones, N.C., and B. Gardner. 1979. Mol. Immunol. 16:697). C1q is a large, structurally complex glycoprotein of ˜410 kDa present in human serum at a concentration of 70 μg/ml (Cooper, N. R. 1985. Adv. Immunol. 37:151). Together with two serine proteases, C1r and C1s, C1q forms the complex C1, the first component of complement. At least two of the N-terminal globular heads of C1q must be bound to the Fc of Igs for C1 activation, hence for initiation of the complement cascade (Cooper, N. R. 1985. Adv. Immunol. 37:151).\n\n\nThe term “antibody half-life” as used herein means a pharmacokinetic property of an antibody that is a measure of the mean survival time of antibody molecules following their administration. Antibody half-life can be expressed as the time required to eliminate 50 percent of a known quantity of immunoglobulin from the patient's body or a specific compartment thereof, for example, as measured in serum or plasma, i.e., circulating half-life, or in other tissues. Half-life may vary from one immunoglobulin or class of immunoglobulin to another. In general, an increase in antibody half-life results in an increase in mean residence time (MRT) in circulation for the antibody administered.\n\n\nThe term “isotype” refers to the classification of an antibody's heavy or light chain constant region. The constant domains of antibodies are not involved in binding to antigen, but exhibit various effector functions. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the heavy chain constant region, a given human antibody or immunoglobulin can be assigned to one of five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. Several of these classes may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1 (gamma 1), IgG2 (gamma 2), IgG3 (gamma 3), and IgG4 (gamma 4), and IgA1 and IgA2. The heavy chain constant regions that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called α, δ, ε, γ, and μ, respectively. The structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well-known. Of the various human immunoglobulin classes, only human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, and IgM are known to activate complement. Human IgG1 and IgG3 are known to mediate in humans. Human light chain constant regions may be classified into two major classes, kappa and lambda.\n\n\nIf desired, the isotype of an antibody that specifically binds KDR can be switched, for example to take advantage of a biological property of a different isotype. For example, in some circumstances it can be desirable in connection with the generation of antibodies as therapeutic antibodies against KDR that the antibodies be capable of fixing complement and participating in complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). There are a number of isotypes of antibodies that are capable of the same, including, without limitation, the following: murine IgM, murine IgG2a, murine IgG2b, murine IgG3, human IgM, human IgA, human IgG1, and human IgG3. In other embodiments it can be desirable in connection with the generation of antibodies as therapeutic antibodies against KDR that the antibodies be capable of binding Fc receptors on effector cells and participating in antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC). There are a number of isotypes of antibodies that are capable of the same, including, without limitation, the following: murine IgG2a, murine IgG2b, murine IgG3, human IgG1, and human IgG3. It will be appreciated that antibodies that are generated need not initially possess such an isotype but, rather, the antibody as generated can possess any isotype and the antibody can be isotype switched thereafter using conventional techniques that are well known in the art. Such techniques include the use of direct recombinant techniques (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397), cell-cell fusion techniques (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,916,771 and 6,207,418), among others.\n\n\nBy way of example, the anti-KDR antibodies discussed herein are fully human antibodies. If an antibody possessed desired binding to KDR, it could be readily isotype switched to generate a human IgM, human IgG1, or human IgG3 isotype, while still possessing the same variable region (which defines the antibody's specificity and some of its affinity). Such molecule would then be capable of fixing complement and participating in CDC and/or be capable of binding to Fc receptors on effector cells and participating in ADCC.\n\n\n“Whole blood assays” use unfractionated blood as a source of natural effectors. Blood contains complement in the plasma, together with FcR-expressing cellular effectors, such as polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and mononuclear cells (MNCs). Thus, whole blood assays allow simultaneous evaluation of the synergy of both ADCC and CDC effector mechanisms in vitro.\n\n\nA “therapeutically effective” amount as used herein is an amount that provides some improvement or benefit to the subject. Stated in another way, a “therapeutically effective” amount is an amount that provides some alleviation, mitigation, and/or decrease in at least one clinical symptom. Clinical symptoms associated with the disorders that can be treated by the methods of the invention are well-known to those skilled in the art. Further, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the therapeutic effects need not be complete or curative, as long as some benefit is provided to the subject.\n\n\nThe term “and/or” as used herein is to be taken as specific disclosure of each of the two specified features or components with or without the other. For example “A and/or B” is to be taken as specific disclosure of each of (i) A, (ii) B and (iii) A and B, just as if each is set out individually herein.\n\n\nAntibody Structure\n\n\nThe basic antibody structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one “light” (about 25 kDa) and one “heavy” chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgA, and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a “J” region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a “D” region of about 10 more amino acids. See generally, \nFundamental Immunology \nCh. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site.\n\n\nThus, an intact antibody has two binding sites. Except in bifunctional or bispecific antibodies, the two binding sites are the same.\n\n\nThe chains all exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hyper variable regions, also called CDRs. The CDRs from the two chains of each pair are aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. From N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chains comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest \n(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987 and 1991)), or Chothia & Lesk \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901-917 (1987); Chothia et al. \nNature \n342:878-883 (1989).\n\n\nA bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab′ fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai & Lachmann \nClin. Exp. Immunol. \n79: 315-321 (1990), Kostelny et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n148:1547-1553 (1992). Bispecific antibodies do not exist in the form of fragments having a single binding site (e.g., Fab, Fab′, and Fv).\n\n\nTypically, a VH domain is paired with a VL domain to provide an antibody antigen-binding site, although a VH or VL domain alone may be used to bind antigen. The VH domain (see Table 12) may be paired with the VL domain (see Table 13), so that an antibody antigen-binding site is formed comprising both the VH and VL domains.\n\n\nHuman Antibodies and Humanization of Antibodies\n\n\nHuman antibodies avoid some of the problems associated with antibodies that possess murine or rat variable and/or constant regions. The presence of such murine or rat derived proteins can lead to the rapid clearance of the antibodies or can lead to the generation of an immune response against the antibody by a patient. In order to avoid the utilization of murine or rat derived antibodies, fully human antibodies can be generated through the introduction of functional human antibody loci into a rodent, other mammal or animal so that the rodent, other mammal or animal produces fully human antibodies.\n\n\nOne method for generating fully human antibodies is through the use of XenoMouse® strains of mice that have been engineered to contain up to but less than 1000 kb-sized germline configured fragments of the human heavy chain locus and kappa light chain locus. See Mendez et al. \nNature Genetics \n15:146-156 (1997) and Green and Jakobovits \nJ. Exp. Med. \n188:483-495 (1998). The XenoMouse® strains are available from Amgen, Inc. (Fremont, Calif., U.S.A).\n\n\nSuch mice, then, are capable of producing human immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies and are deficient in the production of murine immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies. Technologies utilised for achieving the same are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/759,620, filed Dec. 3, 1996 and International Patent Application Nos.

See also Mendez et al. \nNature Genetics \n15:146-156 (1997), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nThe production of the XenoMouse® strains of mice is further discussed and delineated in U.S. patent application Ser.

In the minilocus approach, an exogenous Ig locus is mimicked through the inclusion of pieces (individual genes) from the Ig locus. Thus, one or more V\nH \ngenes, one or more D\nH \ngenes, one or more J\nH \ngenes, a mu constant region, and usually a second constant region (preferably a gamma constant region) are formed into a construct for insertion into an animal.

See European Patent Application Nos. 773 288 and 843 961, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Additionally, KM™-mice, which are the result of cross-breeding of Kirin's Tc mice with Medarex's minilocus (Humab) mice have been generated. These mice possess the human IgH transchromosome of the Kirin mice and the kappa chain transgene of the Genpharm mice (Ishida et al., Cloning Stem Cells, (2002) 4:91-102).\n\n\nHuman antibodies can also be derived by in vitro methods. Suitable examples include but are not limited to phage display (Medimmune, Morphosys, Dyax, Biosite/Medarex, Xoma, Symphogen, Alexion (formerly Proliferon), Affimed) ribosome display (Medimmune), yeast display, and the like.\n\n\nPreparation of Antibodies\n\n\nAntibodies, as described herein, were prepared through the utilization of the XenoMouse® technology, as described below. Such mice are capable of producing human immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies and are deficient in the production of murine immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies. Technologies utilised for achieving the same are disclosed in the patents, applications, and references disclosed in the background section herein. In particular, however, a preferred embodiment of transgenic production of mice and antibodies therefrom is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/759,620, filed Dec. 3, 1996 and International Patent Application Nos. WO 98/24893, published Jun. 11, 1998 and WO 00/76310, published Dec. 21, 2000, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. See also Mendez et al. \nNature Genetics \n15:146-156 (1997), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nThrough the use of such technology, fully human monoclonal antibodies to a variety of antigens have been produced. Essentially, XenoMouse® lines of mice are immunised with an antigen of interest (e.g. KDR), lymphatic cells (such as B-cells) are recovered from the hyperimmunised mice, and the recovered lymphocytes are fused with a myeloid-type cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines. These hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produced antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. Provided herein are methods for the production of multiple hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies specific to KDR. Further, provided herein are characterisation of the antibodies produced by such cell lines, including nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses of the heavy and light chains of such antibodies.\n\n\nAlternatively, instead of being fused to myeloma cells to generate hybridomas, B cells can be directly assayed. For example, CD19+ B cells can be isolated from hyperimmune XenoMouse® mice and allowed to proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Antibodies from the cell supernatants are then screened by ELISA for reactivity against the KDR immunogen. The supernatants might also be screened for immunoreactivity against fragments of KDR to further map the different antibodies for binding to domains of functional interest on KDR. The antibodies may also be screened other related human endoglycosidases and against the rat, the mouse, and non-human primate, such as Cynomolgus monkey, orthologues of KDR, the last to determine species cross-reactivity. B cells from wells containing antibodies of interest may be immortalised by various methods including fusion to make hybridomas either from individual or from pooled wells, or by infection with EBV or transfection by known immortalising genes and then plating in suitable medium. Alternatively, single plasma cells secreting antibodies with the desired specificities are then isolated using an KDR-specific hemolytic plaque assay (see for example Babcook et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n93:7843-48 (1996)). Cells targeted for lysis are preferably sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) coated with the KDR antigen.\n\n\nIn the presence of a B-cell culture containing plasma cells secreting the immunoglobulin of interest and complement, the formation of a plaque indicates specific KDR-mediated lysis of the sheep red blood cells surrounding the plasma cell of interest. The single antigen-specific plasma cell in the center of the plaque can be isolated and the genetic information that encodes the specificity of the antibody is isolated from the single plasma cell. Using reverse-transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR), the DNA encoding the heavy and light chain variable regions of the antibody can be cloned. Such cloned DNA can then be further inserted into a suitable expression vector, preferably a vector cassette such as a pcDNA, more preferably such a pcDNA vector containing the constant domains of immunglobulin heavy and light chain. The generated vector can then be transfected into host cells, e.g., HEK293 cells, CHO cells, and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing transcription, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\nAs will be appreciated, antibodies that specifically bind KDR can be expressed in cell lines other than hybridoma cell lines. Sequences encoding particular antibodies can be used to transform a suitable mammalian host cell. Transformation can be by any known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell, including, for example packaging the polynucleotide in a virus (or into a viral vector) and transducing a host cell with the virus (or vector) or by transfection procedures known in the art, as exemplified by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,216, 4,912,040, 4,740,461, and 4,959,455 (which patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference). The transformation procedure used depends upon the host to be transformed. Methods for introducing heterologous polynucleotides into mammalian cells are well known in the art and include dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei.\n\n\nMammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known in the art and include many immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), including but not limited to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), human epithelial kidney 293 cells, and a number of other cell lines. Cell lines of particular preference are selected through determining which cell lines have high expression levels and produce antibodies with constitutive KDR binding properties.\n\n\nIn the cell-cell fusion technique, a myeloma, CHO cell or other cell line is prepared that possesses a heavy chain with any desired isotype and another myeloma, CHO cell or other cell line is prepared that possesses the light chain. Such cells can, thereafter, be fused and a cell line expressing an intact antibody can be isolated.\n\n\nAccordingly, as antibody candidates are generated that meet desired “structural” attributes as discussed above, they can generally be provided with at least certain of the desired “functional” attributes through isotype switching.\n\n\nTherapeutic Administration and Formulations\n\n\nEmbodiments of the invention include sterile pharmaceutical formulations of anti-KDR antibodies that are useful as treatments for diseases. Such formulations would inhibit the binding of a native KDR-specific ligand such as, for example, VEGF, to KDR, thereby effectively treating pathological conditions where, for example, serum or tissue KDR expression is abnormally elevated. Anti-KDR antibodies preferably possess adequate affinity to potently inhibit native KDR-specific ligands such as, for example, VEGF, and preferably have an adequate duration of action to allow for infrequent dosing in humans. A prolonged duration of action will allow for less frequent and more convenient dosing schedules by alternate parenteral routes such as subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.\n\n\nSterile formulations can be created, for example, by filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution of the antibody. The antibody ordinarily will be stored in lyophilized form or in solution. Therapeutic antibody compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having an adapter that allows retrieval of the formulation, such as a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.\n\n\nThe route of antibody administration is in accord with known methods, e.g., injection or infusion by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intramuscular, intraocular, intraarterial, intrathecal, inhalation or intralesional routes, direct injection to a tumour site, or by sustained release systems as noted below. The antibody is preferably administered continuously by infusion or by bolus injection.\n\n\nAn effective amount of antibody to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic objectives, the route of administration, and the condition of the patient. Accordingly, it is preferred that the therapist titer the dosage and modify the route of administration as required to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. Typically, the clinician will administer antibody until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional assays or by the assays described herein.\n\n\nAntibodies, as described herein, can be prepared in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This therapeutic composition can be administered intravenously or through the nose or lung, preferably as a liquid or powder aerosol (lyophilized). The composition may also be administered parenterally or subcutaneously as desired. When administered systemically, the therapeutic composition should be sterile, pyrogen-free and in a parenterally acceptable solution having due regard for pH, isotonicity, and stability. These conditions are known to those skilled in the art. Briefly, dosage formulations of the compounds described herein are prepared for storage or administration by mixing the compound having the desired degree of purity with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers. Such materials are non-toxic to the recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as TRIS HCl, phosphate, citrate, acetate and other organic acid salts; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about ten residues) peptides such as polyarginine, proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidinone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or arginine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including cellulose or its derivatives, glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; counterions such as sodium and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN, PLURONICS or polyethyleneglycol.\n\n\nSterile compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice as described in \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy \n(20\nth \ned, Lippincott Williams & Wilkens Publishers (2003)). For example, dissolution or suspension of the active compound in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as water or naturally occurring vegetable oil like sesame, peanut, or cottonseed oil or a synthetic fatty vehicle like ethyl oleate or the like may be desired. Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants and the like can be incorporated according to accepted pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\nSuitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the polypeptide, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, films or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (e.g., poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) as described by Langer et al., \nJ. Biomed Mater. Res\n., (1981) 15:167-277 and Langer, \nChem. Tech\n., (1982) 12:98-105, or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919, EP 58,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., \nBiopolymers\n, (1983) 22:547-556), non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra), degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON Depot™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988).\n\n\nWhile polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated proteins remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37° C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for protein stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S—S bond formation through disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.\n\n\nSustained-released compositions also include preparations of crystals of the antibody suspended in suitable formulations capable of maintaining crystals in suspension. These preparations when injected subcutaneously or intraperitonealy can produce a sustained release effect. Other compositions also include liposomally entrapped antibodies. Liposomes containing such antibodies are prepared by methods known per se: U.S. Pat. No. DE 3,218,121; Epstein et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA\n, (1985) 82:3688-3692; Hwang et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA\n, (1980) 77:4030-4034; EP 52,322; EP 36,676; EP 88,046; EP 143,949; 142,641; Japanese patent application 83-118008; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545; and EP 102,324.\n\n\nThe dosage of the antibody formulation for a given patient will be determined by the attending physician taking into consideration various factors known to modify the action of drugs including severity and type of disease, body weight, sex, diet, time and route of administration, other medications and other relevant clinical factors. Therapeutically effective dosages may be determined by either in vitro or in vivo methods.\n\n\nAn effective amount of the antibodies, described herein, to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic objectives, the route of administration, and the condition of the patient. Accordingly, it is preferred for the therapist to titer the dosage and modify the route of administration as required to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. A typical daily dosage might range from about 0.0001 mg/kg, 0.001 mg/kg, 0.01 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg to up to 100 mg/kg, 1000 mg/kg, 10000 mg/kg or more, of the patient's body weight depending on the factors mentioned above. The dosage may be between 0.0001 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, 0.0001 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, 0.0001 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, 0.0001 and 2 mg/kg, 0.0001 and 1 mg/kg, 0.0001 mg/kg and 0.75 mg/kg, 0.0001 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg, 0.0001 mg/kg to 0.25 mg/kg, 0.0001 to 0.15 mg/kg, 0.0001 to 0.10 mg/kg, 0.001 to 0.5 mg/kg, 0.01 to 0.25 mg/kg or 0.01 to 0.10 mg/kg of the patient's body weight depending on the factors mentioned above. Typically, the clinician will administer the therapeutic antibody until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional assays or as described herein.\n\n\nDoses of antibodies of the invention may be repeated and the administrations may be separated by at least 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, 30 days, 45 days, 2 months, 75 days, 3 months, or at least 6 months.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated that administration of therapeutic entities in accordance with the compositions and methods herein will be administered with suitable carriers, excipients, and other agents that are incorporated into formulations to provide improved transfer, delivery, tolerance, and the like. These formulations include, for example, powders, pastes, ointments, jellies, waxes, oils, lipids, lipid (cationic or anionic) containing vesicles (such as Lipofectin™) DNA conjugates, anhydrous absorption pastes, oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, emulsions carbowax (polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights), semi-solid gels, and semi-solid mixtures containing carbowax. Any of the foregoing mixtures may be appropriate in treatments and therapies in accordance with the present invention, provided that the active ingredient in the formulation is not inactivated by the formulation and the formulation is physiologically compatible and tolerable with the route of administration.

Such modalities include, without limitation, advanced antibody therapeutics, such as bispecific antibodies, immunotoxins, and radiolabeled therapeutics, single domain antibodies, antibody fragments, such as a Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv or dAb, generation of peptide therapeutics, KDR binding domains in novel scaffolds, gene therapies, particularly intrabodies, antisense therapeutics, and small molecules.\n\n\nAn antigen binding site may be provided by means of arrangement of CDRs on non-antibody protein scaffolds, such as fibronectin or cytochrome B etc. (Haan & Maggos (2004) BioCentury, 12(5): A1-A6; Koide et al. (1998) Journal of Molecular Biology, 284: 1141-1151; Nygren et al. (1997) Current Opinion in Structural Biology, 7: 463-469) or by randomising or mutating amino acid residues of a loop within a protein scaffold to confer binding specificity for a desired target. Scaffolds for engineering novel binding sites in proteins have been reviewed in detail by Nygren et al. (Nygren et al. (1997) Current Opinion in Structural Biology, 7: 463-469). Protein scaffolds for antibody mimics are disclosed in WO/0034784, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, in which the inventors describe proteins (antibody mimics) that include a fibronectin type III domain having at least one randomised loop. A suitable scaffold into which to graft one or more CDRs, e.g. a set of HCDRs, may be provided by any domain member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. The scaffold may be a human or non-human protein. An advantage of a non-antibody protein scaffold is that it may provide an antigen-binding site in a scaffold molecule that is smaller and/or easier to manufacture than at least some antibody molecules. Small size of a binding member may confer useful physiological properties, such as an ability to enter cells, penetrate deep into tissues or reach targets within other structures, or to bind within protein cavities of the target antigen. Use of antigen binding sites in non-antibody protein scaffolds is reviewed in Wess, 2004 (Wess, L. In: BioCentury, The Bernstein Report on BioBusiness, 12(42), A1-A7, 2004). Typical are proteins having a stable backbone and one or more variable loops, in which the amino acid sequence of the loop or loops specifically or randomly mutated to create an antigen-binding site that binds the target antigen. Such proteins include the IgG-binding domains of protein A from \nS. aureus\n, transferrin, albumin, tetranectin, fibronectin (e.g. 10th fibronectin type III domain), lipocalins as well as gamma-crystalline and other Affilin™ scaffolds (Scil Proteins). Examples of other approaches include synthetic “Microbodies” based on cyclotides—small proteins having intra-molecular disulphide bonds, Microproteins (Versabodies™, Amunix) and ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins, Molecular Partners).\n\n\nIn addition to antibody sequences and/or an antigen-binding site, a targeted binding agent according to the present invention may comprise other amino acids, e.g. forming a peptide or polypeptide, such as a folded domain, or to impart to the molecule another functional characteristic in addition to ability to bind antigen. Targeted binding agents of the invention may carry a detectable label, or may be conjugated to a toxin or a targeting moiety or enzyme (e.g. via a peptidyl bond or linker). For example, a targeted binding agent may comprise a catalytic site (e.g. in an enzyme domain) as well as an antigen binding site, wherein the antigen binding site binds to the antigen and thus targets the catalytic site to the antigen. The catalytic site may inhibit biological function of the antigen, e.g. by cleavage.\n\n\nIn connection with the generation of advanced antibody therapeutics, where complement fixation is a desirable attribute, it may be possible to sidestep the dependence on complement for cell killing through the use of bispecific antibodies, immunotoxins, or radiolabels, for example.\n\n\nFor example, bispecific antibodies can be generated that comprise (i) two antibodies one with a specificity to KDR and another to a second molecule that are conjugated together, (ii) a single antibody that has one chain specific to KDR and a second chain specific to a second molecule, or (iii) a single chain antibody that has specificity to KDR and the other molecule. Such bispecific antibodies can be generated using techniques that are well known; for example, in connection with (i) and (ii) see e.g., Fanger et al. \nImmunol Methods \n4:72-81 (1994) and Wright and Harris, supra. and in connection with (iii) see e.g., Traunecker et al. \nInt. J. Cancer \n(\nSuppl\n.) 7:51-52 (1992). In each case, the second specificity can be made to the heavy chain activation receptors, including, without limitation, CD16 or CD64 (see e.g., Deo et al. \nImmunol. Today \n18:127 (1997)) or CD89 (see e.g., Valerius et al. \nBlood \n90:4485-4492 (1997)).\n\n\nAntibodies can also be modified to act as immunotoxins, utilizing techniques that are well known in the art. See e.g., Vitetta \nImmunol Today \n14:252 (1993). See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,594. In connection with the preparation of radiolabeled antibodies, such modified antibodies can also be readily prepared utilizing techniques that are well known in the art. See e.g., Junghans et al. in \nCancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy \n655-686 (2d edition, Chafner and Longo, eds., Lippincott Raven (1996)). See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,681,581, 4,735,210, 5,101,827, 5,102,990 (RE 35,500), 5,648,471, and 5,697,902. Each immunotoxin or radiolabeled molecule would be likely to kill cells expressing the desired multimeric enzyme subunit oligomerisation domain.\n\n\nWhen an antibody is linked to an agent (e.g., radioisotope, pharmaceutical composition, or a toxin), it is contemplated that the agent possess a pharmaceutical property selected from the group of antimitotic, alkylating, antimetabolite, antiangiogenic, apoptotic, alkaloid, COX-2, and antibiotic agents and combinations thereof. The drug can be selected from the group of nitrogen mustards, ethylenimine derivatives, alkyl sulfonates, nitrosoureas, triazenes, folic acid analogs, anthracyclines, taxanes, COX-2 inhibitors, pyrimidine analogs, purine analogs, antimetabolites, antibiotics, enzymes, epipodophyllotoxins, platinum coordination complexes, vinca alkaloids, substituted ureas, methyl hydrazine derivatives, adrenocortical suppressants, antagonists, endostatin, taxols, camptothecins, oxaliplatin, doxorubicins and their analogs, and a combination thereof.\n\n\nExamples of toxins further include gelonin, \nPseudomonas \nexotoxin (PE), PE40, PE38, diphtheria toxin, ricin, abrin, alpha toxin, saporin, ribonuclease (RNase), DNase I, Staphylococcal enterotoxin-A, pokeweed antiviral protein, gelonin, \nPseudomonas \nendotoxin, members of the enediyne family of molecules, such as calicheamicin and esperamicin, as well as derivatives, combinations and modifications thereof. Chemical toxins can also be taken from the group consisting of duocarmycin (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,703,080 and 4,923,990), methotrexate, doxorubicin, melphalan, chlorambucil, ARA-C, vindesine, mitomycin C, cis-platinum, etoposide, bleomycin and 5-fluorouracil. Examples of chemotherapeutic agents also include Adriamycin, Doxorubicin, 5-Fluorouracil, Cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), Cyclophosphamide, Thiotepa, Taxotere (docetaxel), Busulfan, Cytoxin, Taxol, Methotrexate, Cisplatin, Melphalan, Vinblastine, Bleomycin, Etoposide, Ifosfamide, Mitomycin C, Mitoxantrone, Vincreistine, Vinorelbine, Carboplatin, Teniposide, Daunomycin, Caminomycin, Aminopterin, Dactinomycin, Mitomycins, Esperamicins (see, U.S. Pat. No. 4,675,187), Melphalan, and other related nitrogen mustards. Suitable toxins and chemotherapeutic agents are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 19th Ed. (Mack Publishing Co. 1995), and in Goodman And Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 7th Ed. (MacMillan Publishing Co. 1985). Other suitable toxins and/or chemotherapeutic agents are known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\nExamples of radioisotopes include gamma-emitters, positron-emitters, and x-ray emitters that can be used for localisation and/or therapy, and beta-emitters and alpha-emitters that can be used for therapy. The radioisotopes described previously as useful for diagnostics, prognostics and staging are also useful for therapeutics.\n\n\nNon-limiting examples of anti-cancer or anti-leukemia agents include anthracyclines such as doxorubicin (adriamycin), daunorubicin (daunomycin), idarubicin, detorubicin, caminomycin, epirubicin, esorubicin, and morpholino and substituted derivatives, combinations and modifications thereof. Exemplary pharmaceutical agents include cis-platinum, taxol, calicheamicin, vincristine, cytarabine (Ara-C), cyclophosphamide, prednisone, daunorubicin, idarubicin, fludarabine, chlorambucil, interferon alpha, hydroxyurea, temozolomide, thalidomide, and bleomycin, and derivatives, combinations and modifications thereof. Preferably, the anti-cancer or anti-leukemia is doxorubicin, morpholinodoxorubicin, or morpholinodaunorubicin.\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention also encompass antibodies that have half-lives (e.g., serum half-lives) in a mammal, preferably a human, of greater than that of an unmodified antibody. Said antibody half life may be greater than about 15 days, greater than about 20 days, greater than about 25 days, greater than about 30 days, greater than about 35 days, greater than about 40 days, greater than about 45 days, greater than about 2 months, greater than about 3 months, greater than about 4 months, or greater than about 5 months. The increased half-lives of the antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof in a mammal, preferably a human, result in a higher serum titer of said antibodies or antibody fragments in the mammal, and thus, reduce the frequency of the administration of said antibodies or antibody fragments and/or reduces the concentration of said antibodies or antibody fragments to be administered. Antibodies or fragments thereof having increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, antibodies or fragments thereof with increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by modifying (e.g., substituting, deleting or adding) amino acid residues identified as involved in the interaction between the Fc domain and the FcRn receptor (see, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 97/34631 and WO 02/060919, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). Antibodies or fragments thereof with increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by attaching to said antibodies or antibody fragments polymer molecules such as high molecular weight polyethyleneglycol (PEG). PEG can be attached to said antibodies or antibody fragments with or without a multifunctional linker either through site-specific conjugation of the PEG to the N- or C-terminus of said antibodies or antibody fragments or via epsilon-amino groups present on lysine residues. Linear or branched polymer derivatisation that results in minimal loss of biological activity will be used. The degree of conjugation will be closely monitored by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry to ensure proper conjugation of PEG molecules to the antibodies. Unreacted PEG can be separated from antibody-PEG conjugates by, e.g., size exclusion or ion-exchange chromatography.\n\n\nAs will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in the above embodiments, while affinity values can be important, other factors can be as important or more so, depending upon the particular function of the antibody. For example, for an immunotoxin (toxin associated with an antibody), the act of binding of the antibody to the target can be useful; however, in some embodiments, it is the internalisation of the toxin into the cell that is the desired end result. As such, antibodies with a high percent internalisation can be desirable in these situations. Thus, in one embodiment, antibodies with a high efficiency in internalisation are contemplated. A high efficiency of internalisation can be measured as a percent internalised antibody, and can be from a low value to 100%. For example, in varying embodiments, 0.1-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-45, 45-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-99, and 99-100% can be a high efficiency. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the desirable efficiency can be different in different embodiments, depending upon, for example, the associated agent, the amount of antibody that can be administered to an area, the side effects of the antibody-agent complex, the type (e.g., cancer type) and severity of the problem to be treated.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the antibodies disclosed herein provide an assay kit for the detection of KDR expression in mammalian tissues or cells in order to screen for a disease or disorder associated with changes in expression of KDR. The kit comprises an antibody that binds KDR and means for indicating the reaction of the antibody with the antigen, if present.\n\n\nCombinations\n\n\nThe targeted binding agent or antibody defined herein may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve, in addition to the compounds of the invention, conventional surgery or radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Such chemotherapy may include one or more of the following categories of anti tumour agents:\n\n\n(i) other antiproliferative/antineoplastic drugs and combinations thereof, as used in medical oncology, such as alkylating agents (for example cis-platin, oxaliplatin, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, nitrogen mustard, melphalan, chlorambucil, busulphan, temozolamide and nitrosoureas); antimetabolites (for example gemcitabine and antifolates such as fluoropyrimidines like 5-fluorouracil and tegafur, raltitrexed, methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside, and hydroxyurea); antitumor antibiotics (for example anthracyclines like adriamycin, bleomycin, doxorubicin, daunomycin, epirubicin, idarubicin, mitomycin-C, dactinomycin and mithramycin); antimitotic agents (for example vinca alkaloids like vincristine, vinblastine, vindesine and vinorelbine and taxoids like taxol and taxotere and polokinase inhibitors); and topoisomerase inhibitors (for example epipodophyllotoxins like etoposide and teniposide, amsacrine, topotecan and camptothecin);\n\n\n(ii) cytostatic agents such as antioestrogens (for example tamoxifen, fulvestrant, toremifene, raloxifene, droloxifene and iodoxyfene), antiandrogens (for example bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide and cyproterone acetate), LHRH antagonists or LHRH agonists (for example goserelin, leuprorelin and buserelin), progestogens (for example megestrol acetate), aromatase inhibitors (for example as anastrozole, letrozole, vorazole and exemestane) and inhibitors of 5α-reductase such as finasteride;\n\n\n(iii) anti-invasion agents (for example c-Src kinase family inhibitors like 4-(6-chloro-2,3-methylenedioxyanilino)-7-[2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)ethoxy]-5-tetrahydropyran-4-yloxyquinazoline (AZD0530; International Patent Application WO 01/94341) and N-(2-chloro-6-methylphenyl)-2-{6-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-methylpyrimidin-4-ylamino}thiazole-5-carboxamide (dasatinib, BMS-354825\n; J.

There were two harvests performed for this program. Harvest 1 used six mice with ID numbers 157166, 157168, 157597, 157599, 157600, 157602. \nHarvest\n 2 used five mice with ID numbers 157662, 157663, 157665, 157672, 157694.\n\n\nThe lymphoid cells were dissociated by grinding in DMEM to release the cells from the tissues and the cells were suspended in DMEM. The cells were counted, and 0.9 ml DMEM per 100 million lymphocytes added to the cell pellet to resuspend the cells gently but completely. Using 100 μl of CD90+magnetic beads per 100 million cells, the cells were labeled by incubating the cells with the magnetic beads at 4° C. for 15 minutes. The magnetically labeled cell suspension containing up to 10\n8 \npositive cells (or up to 2×10\n9 \ntotal cells) was loaded onto a LS+column and the column washed with DMEM. The total effluent was collected as the CD90-negative fraction (most of these cells were expected to be B cells).\n\n\nThe fusion was performed by mixing washed enriched Day 6 B cells with nonsecretory myeloma P3X63Ag8.653 cells purchased from ATCC, cat. # CRL 1580 (Kearney et al, J. Immunol. 123, 1979, 1548-1550) at a ratio of 1:4. The cell mixture was gently pelleted by centrifugation at 400×g for 4 minutes. After decanting of the supernatant, the cells were gently mixed using a 1 ml pipette. Preheated PEG (1 ml per 10\n6 \nB-cells) was slowly added with gentle agitation over 1 minute followed by 1 minute of mixing. Preheated IDMEM (2 ml per 10\n6 \nB-cells) was then added over 2 minutes with gentle agitation. Finally preheated IDMEM (8 ml per 10\n6 \nB-cells) was added over 3 minutes.\n\n\nThe fused cells were spun down at 400×g for 6 minutes and resuspended in 20 ml of Selection media (DMEM (Invitrogen), 15% FBS (Hyclone), supplemented with L-glutamine, pen/strep, MEM Non-essential amino acids, Sodium Pyruvate, 2-Mercaptoethanol (all from Invitrogen), HA-Azaserine Hypoxanthine and OPI (oxaloacetate, pyruvate, bovine insulin) (both from Sigma) and IL-6 (Boehringer Mannheim)) per 10\n6 \nB-cells. Cells were incubated for 20-30 minutes at 37° C. and then resuspended in 200 ml Selection media and cultured for 3-4 days in a T175 flask.\n\n\n \nDay\n 3 post fusion the cells were collected, spun for 8 minutes at 400×g and resuspended in 10 ml Selection media per 10\n6 \nfused B-cells. FACS analysis of hybridoma population was performed, and cells were subsequently frozen down.\n\n\nHybridomas were grown as routine in the selective medium. Exhaustive supernatants collected from the hybridomas that potentially produce anti-human KDR antibodies were subjected to subsequent screening assays.\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nAntibody Titer Measurement\n\n\nNative Antigen Binding of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC)\n\n\nFACS analysis was performed on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to measure the titers of antibody against human KDR produced as described in Examples 1 and 2. HUVECs were seeded at 60,000 cells/well and incubated with 2 μL of sample (at 1:50 dilution) for one hour at 4° C. The wells were then washed and incubated with Cy5-conjugated goat anti-human antibody at 5 μg/mL and 7-Amino-Actinomycin (7AAD) at 5 μg/mL for 15 minutes at 4° C. Bound KDR was detected using FACS analysis. The positive control was goat anti-KDR antibody (R&D Systems, Inc.), and negative controls included negative controls included naïve XMG2 sera and naïve XMG4 (XM3C-1) sera. Animals with the greatest FACS Geometric Mean Fluorescence were selected for subsequent hybridoma generation.

Cross-reactivity was measured using an ELISA based assay. Cross-reactivity to KDR mouse ortholog (Flk-1) was desired. However, antibodies that selected over Flt-1 were chosen for further analysis.\n\n\nPlates were coated with human VEGFR1 (Flt-1)/Fc (Flt-1, Cat. #321-FL/CF, R&D Systems, Inc.) or mouse KDR (Flk-1)/Fc (Flk-1, Cat. #443-KD/CF, R&D Systems, Inc.) at 500 ng/mL and incubated overnight at 4° C. After washing and blocking the plates, the antibody-containing supernatants were added (at 1:5 dilution) into the coated wells and incubated for one hour at room temperature. The plates were then incubated with mouse \n \n \nanti-human IgG\n \n \n 2, 3 and 4 and subsequently with goat anti-mouse IgG Fc POD, to detect and measure bound antibodies.

HUVECs were seeded at 15,000 cells/well and incubated with 100 μL of sample supernatant (at 1:50 dilution) for one hour at 4° C. The positive control was goat anti-KDR antibody (R&D Systems, Inc.), and negative controls included irrelevant hybridoma supernatants at the same dilution. The cells were then washed and incubated with Cy5-conjugated goat anti-human antibody at 5 μg/mL and 7-Amino-Actinomycin D (7AAD) at 5 μg/mL for 15 minutes at 4° C. Bound KDR was detected using FACS analysis. Table 8 lists the FACS data obtained from analysis of the HUVECs. Antibodies with strong binding to HUVEC cells were considered as having higher relative avidity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNative binding to HUVECs as measured by FACS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFACS Geometric Mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1:50 dilution of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMAb ID\n\n\nhybridoma supernatant)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1G6\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n21A1\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n21H6\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n21H9\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n22B8\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n24B3\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n24C9\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n27A3\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n27D10\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29A3\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29H3\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29D4\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29F7\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29A11\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30A1\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30E3\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30F6\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30D7\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30H10\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n31E11\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n32B2\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n32F4\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n32G7\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n32C11\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n33B1\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n33E1\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n33C3\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n33D5\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nDetermination of Relative Potency of Antibody-Containing Supernatants\n\n\nThe relative potency of the various antibody-containing supernatants was compared by measuring how well the antibodies blocked KDR phosphorylation in an endogenously KDR-expressing normal cell line (HUVEC). The assays were conducted using a supernatant dilution of 1:20 and included examination of the blockade of both VEGF165-mediated and VEGF-E mediated KDR tyrosine phosphorylation. VEGF165 binds to both KDR:KDR homodimers and to KDR:VEGF-Receptor-1 hetrodimers. VEGF-E is an Orf virus homologue of VEGF165; however, unlike VEGF165, VEGF-E is specifically binds to KDR, therefore providing selective analysis of KDR dimerization (\nEndocrine Reviews\n, August 2004, 25(4): 581-611).\n\n\nThe relative potencies of the different antibody containing supernatants were also examined for their ability to block survival of serum-deprived HUVEC cells as mediated by both VEGF165 and VEGF-E. These assays were also performed at a supernatant dilution of 1:20. All incubations with HUVEC cells took place at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\nAssay to Measure Inhibition of VEGF165-Mediated KDR Activity\n\n\nHUVEC cells were seeded at 25,000 cells/well and incubated overnight in Endothelial Cell Basal Medium-2 (EBM-2, Clonetics EGM-2 BulletKit, catalog #CC-3162)+2% FCS+the following growth supplements: hydrocortisone, hFGF-B, R3-IGF-1, ascorbic acid, heparin, FBS, hEGF, and GA-1000. The cells were then washed and incubated in supplement-free media overnight. On the third day, the various antibody-containing supernatants were added to the HUVEC cells and incubated for 2 hours. The supernatant volumes were then removed and replaced by 50 μL of VEGF165 at 2 nM final concentration. After incubation with VEGF165 for 7 minutes, the cells were lysed, and the cell lysates were measured for inhibition of VEGF165-mediated KDR activity.

The cells were then washed and the various antibody-containing supernatants (at either 1:10 or 1:20 dilution in 50 μL of basal EBM-2 media) were added to the HUVEC cells and incubated for 2 hours. Fifty (50) μL of VEGF165 (1 nM final concentration) with chloroquine (25 nM final concentration, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.01% FCS (final concentration) was added to the cells, and the cells were incubated for 4 days at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. Cell survival was then measured by addition of luminescent substrate (Cell Titer Glo, Promega) per manufacturer's protocol and detected using a luminometer. Antibody inhibition of HUVEC survival is indicated by lower Relative Luminscence Unit (RLU) values.

The cells were then washed and the various antibody-containing supernatants (at 1:10 dilution in basal EBM-2 media) were added to the HUVEC cells and incubated for 2 hours. VEGF-E (Cederlane) was added to the cells to a final concentration of 1 nM, and the cells were incubated for 4 days. Cell survival was then measured as above by addition of luminescent substrate and luminometer assay. Table 12 provides a listing of the degree of inhibition observed as a percentage of VEGF-E maximal activity.

The experiments were performed using soluble KDR extracellular domain (ECD) (Calbiochem).\n\n\nHigh Antigen (HA) Quantitation (ELISA)\n\n\nELISA plates were coated with a greater amount of KDR (at 500 ng/mL) in comparison with the Limited Antigen Quantitation assay described below. Sample containing antibody (Ab) was titrated on the KDR-coated ELISA plates and was incubated overnight at 4° C. to allow Ab binding to approach equilibrium. Titration of Ab in sample covered a dilution range of 1:25 to 1:18,225. A standard curve of KDR-specific antibody of known concentration was used to define the linear range of the assay. Data within the linear range were used to derive the relative concentration of KDR-specific Ab in each titrated sample. The high KDR concentration and the overnight incubation limited the effect of Ab affinity, allowing quantitation of the relative amount of KDR-specific Ab present in each sample.\n\n\nLimited Antigen (LA) Quantitation (ELISA)\n\n\nELISA plates were coated with a lower amount of KDR (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 ng/mL) in comparison with the High Antigen Quantitation assay described above. Samples containing one concentration of antibody (Ab) (1:25 dilution) were incubated overnight to allow Ab binding to approach equilibrium. The low antigen concentration limited the effect of antibody concentration, allowing ranking of the antibodies based on their relative affinity.\n\n\nTables 13 and 14 summarize the results for the

10\n\n\nStructural Analysis of KDR Antibodies\n\n\nThe variable heavy chains and the variable light chains of the antibodies were sequenced to determine their DNA sequences. The complete sequence information for the anti-KDR antibodies is provided in the sequence listing with nucleotide and amino acid sequences for each gamma and kappa chain combination. The variable heavy sequences were analyzed to determine the VH family, the D-region sequence and the J-region sequence. The sequences were then translated to determine the primary amino acid sequence and compared to the germline VH, D and J-region sequences to assess somatic hypermutations.\n\n\nTable 20 is a table comparing the antibody heavy chain regions to their cognate germ line heavy chain region. Table 21 is a table comparing the antibody kappa light chain regions to their cognate germ line light chain region. It should be appreciated that amino acid sequences among the sister clones collected from each hybridoma are identical. As an example, the heavy chain and light chain sequences for 30E3.3 would be identical to the sequences for 30E3.1 and 30E3.2. For ease of viewing Tables 20 and 21, sister clones are grouped together and identified by their common chain name. For example, the sequences for 30E3.1, 30E3.2 and 30E3.3 are listed as a common sequence under the chain name “30E3”.\n\n\nThe variable (V) regions of immunoglobulin chains are encoded by multiple germ line DNA segments, which are joined into functional variable regions (V\nH\nDJ\nH \nor V\nK\nJ\nK\n) during B-cell ontogeny. The molecular and genetic diversity of the antibody response to KDR was studied in detail. These assays revealed several points specific to anti-KDR antibodies. It is of note that monoclonal antibodies 29A11, 32B2, 30E3, 30H10 and 32C11 appear to use D1-14 in the reverse complement orientation.\n\n\nIt should also be appreciated that where a particular antibody differs from its respective germline sequence at the amino acid level, the antibody sequence can be mutated back to the germline sequence. Such corrective mutations can occur at one, two, three or more positions, or a combination of any of the mutated positions, using standard molecular biological techniques. By way of non-limiting example, Table 16 shows that the light chain sequence of mAb 24B3 (SEQ ID NO.: 44) differs from the corresponding germline sequence (SEQ ID NO.:124) through a Ser to Asn mutation (mutation 1) in the CDR1 region, a Thr to Ala mutation (mutation 2) in the CDR2 region and an Arg to Ser mutation (mutation 3) in the CDR3 region. Thus, the amino acid or nucleotide sequence encoding the light chain of mAb 24B3 can be modified to change mutation 1 to yield the germline sequence at the site of mutation 1. Further, the amino acid or nucleotide sequence encoding the light chain of mAb 24B3 can be modified to change \nmutation\n 2 or \nmutation\n 3 to yield the germline sequence at the site of \nmutation\n 2 or \nmutation\n 3. Still further, the amino acid or nucleotide sequence encoding the light chain of mAb 24B3 can be modified to change both mutation 1 and \nmutation\n 2, or any other combination of two or more mutations to yield the germline sequence at those particular sites. Tables 15-19 below illustrate the positions of such variations from the germline for mAb 27D10, 24B3 and 33C3. Tables 15a-19a illustrate the positions of such variations from the germline for mAb 27D10, 24B3 and 33C3. Each row represents a unique combination of germline and non-germline residues at the position indicated by bold type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary

antibodies was determined to discriminate candidate antibodies based on their ability to prevent the VEGF165-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR in HUVEC cells. This assay was performed with two different conditions, one with a one hour pre-incubation of antibody with HUVEC cells at 4° C. and the second with a 24-hour pre-incubation of antibody with HUVEC cells at 37° C.\n\n\nHUVEC cells were seeded at 25,000 cells/well in supplemented media (EMB-2+2% FCS) and incubated overnight at 37° C. The cells were then incubated overnight in media without supplement at 37° C. On \n \nday\n \n 3, 50 μL/well of candidate antibody titration or serum-free media (for control) was added to the HUVEC cells. The cells were pre-incubated with candidate antibody for either one hour at 4° C. or for 24 hours at 37° C.

The ability of the antibodies to bind soluble KDR Ig4-7 domain and to the entire KDR extracellular domain (ECD) was also measured.\n\n\nCross-reactivity experiments were carried out and measured using an ELISA based assay as described in Example 6. Briefly, titrations of purified antibody (1:10 serial dilutions over 3 data points, starting concentration=1 μg/mL) were added into wells coated with human VEGFR1 (Flt-1, Cat. #321-FL/CF, R&D Systems, Inc.) at 5 μg/mL, mouse KDR (Flk-1, Cat. #443-KD/CF, R&D Systems, Inc.) at 5 μg/mL), soluble KDR Ig4-7 (supernatant, diluted 1:1), or whole KDR-ECD (Cat. # 676490, Calbiochem) at 5 μg/mL. Antibody controls included IgG1 and IgG4 (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #15154 and #14639, respectively).

The assays were conducted using multiple antibody concentrations and included examination of antibody ability to block VEGF165-mediated KDR tyrosine phosphorylation, ability to block VEGF165-mediated survival of serum-deprived HUVEC, and inhibition of VEGF165-mediated release of 6-keto Prostaglandin F\n1α \nfrom HUVEC cells. All incubations with HUVEC cells took place at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \nexcept where indicated.\n\n\nAssay to Measure Inhibition of VEGF165-mediated KDR Activity\n\n\nHUVEC cells were seeded at 25,000 cells/well and incubated overnight in supplemented media (EBM-2+2% FCS+all supplements except VEGF). The cells were then washed and incubated in supplement-free media overnight. On the third day, the various purified antibodies (at 100 nM starting concentration and serially diluted 1:5 to 6 pM final concentration) were added to the HUVEC cells and incubated for one hour at 4° C. The media was then replaced by 50 μL of VEGF165 at 2 nM final concentration. After stimulation with VEGF165 for 10 minutes, the cells were lysed, and the cell lysates were measured for inhibition of VEGF165-mediated KDR activity. Table 29 indicates the level of inhibition of VEGF165-mediated KDR tyrosine phosphorylation as EC50 values and as percentage inhibition values.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 29\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInhibition of VEGF165-mediated KDR tyrosine phosphorylation\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMaximum Inhibition\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nat 100 nM\n \n \n \n \n \nEC50 (nM)\n \n(% Inhibition)\n \n \n \n \n \nMAb ID\n \nN = 1\n \nN = 2\n \nAverage\n \nN = 1\n \nN = 2\n \nAverage\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n27A3\n \n3.4\n \n2.9\n \n3.1\n \n77%\n \n79%\n \n78%\n \n \n \n32F4\n \n1.7\n \n1.9\n \n1.8\n \n71%\n \n79%\n \n75%\n \n \n \n27D10\n \n1.6\n \n2.3\n \n1.9\n \n70%\n \n75%\n \n72%\n \n \n \n21H6\n \n7.1\n \n6.7\n \n6.9\n \n81%\n \n84%\n \n82%\n \n \n \n30H10\n \n0.6\n \n0.2\n \n0.4\n \n36%\n \n22%\n \n29%\n \n \n \n29H3\n \n0.5\n \n0.4\n \n0.4\n \n33%\n \n30%\n \n32%\n \n \n \n32G7\n \n0.6\n \n0.6\n \n0.6\n \n69%\n \n77%\n \n73%\n \n \n \n29D4\n \n2.0\n \n1.9\n \n1.9\n \n74%\n \n77%\n \n75%\n \n \n \n33E1\n \n5.8\n \n5.1\n \n5.5\n \n73%\n \n75%\n \n74%\n \n \n \n31E11\n \n2.0\n \n1.9\n \n1.9\n \n84%\n \n86%\n \n85%\n \n \n \n24B3\n \n2.1\n \n2.3\n \n2.2\n \n78%\n \n84%\n \n81%\n \n \n \n22B8\n \n2.7\n \n3.4\n \n3.1\n \n75%\n \n79%\n \n77%\n \n \n \n33C3\n \n1.2\n \n1.1\n \n1.2\n \n83%\n \n86%\n \n85%\n \n \n \n33B1\n \n1.2\n \n1.1\n \n1.1\n \n86%\n \n86%\n \n86%\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAssay to Measure Ability of Antibody to Block VEGF 165-mediated Survival of Serum-deprived HUVEC Cells\n\n\n\nHUVEC cells were seeded at 10,000 cells/well and incubated overnight in supplemented media (EBM-2+2% FCS+all supplements except VEGF).

HUVEC cells were seeded at 25,000 cells/well and incubated overnight in supplemented media (EBM-2+2% FCS+all supplements except VEGF). The cells were then washed and incubated in supplement-free media overnight. On the third day, the various purified antibodies were added to the HUVEC cells (at 1:10 serial dilution over three data points, starting concentration=100 nM) and incubated for 2 hours at 4° C.

Immobilization levels were kept between 250 and 350 RU. The concentration of KDR was determined by UV-VIS spectroscopy using a molar absorptivity at 280 nm of 110, 440 M\n−1\ncm\n−1\n, which was calculated from the sequence of the protein using a method developed by Pace et al. (G. R. Grimsley and C. N. Pace (2003) in Current Protocols in Protein Science (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), 3.1.1-3.1.9). The antigen KDR was diluted to a starting concentration of 52 nM and tested in a 3-fold dilution series in triplicate. The running buffer contained HBS-P with 0.1 mg/ml BSA and binding responses were collected at 23 degrees C. Bound complexes were regenerated with a 12 second pulse of 146 mM of phosphoric acid.

The wells were then blocked with PBS/3% BSA for an hour at 37° C. and washed with PBS. Titrations of purified anti-KDR antibody were tested against each coating antibody for cross competition to KDR, using a maximum concentration of 25 μg/ml. Isotype controls IgG1 and IgG2 (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat #I5154 and I5404 respectively) were included. Antibody titrations were prepared in serum free Hams F12 media at 10 times the final assay concentration and 10 μl was added to triplicate test wells. Porcine Aortic Endothelial cells transfected with human KDR were added at a density of 100,000 cells per well in 90 μl of serum free Hams F12 media. The plates were incubated at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nfor 1 hour. Non-adhered cells were flicked from the plates and the wells washed twice with PBS. The adhered cells were fixed with 100% ethanol for 30 minutes at room temperature and then stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 1.5% methanol, for 15 minutes at room temperature. Excess stain was washed off with water and the stain within the cells solubilised with 100 ul per well of 0.1% triton X-100 in double distilled water for 2 hours on an orbital platform. The OD at 570 nm was measured and the percent inhibition of binding by each antibody calculated.\n\n\nThe table indicates the cross competition between each of the antibodies for human KDR as percent inhibition of cell binding to coating antibody by 25 μg/ml of inhibiting antibody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInhibiting Antibody\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n33C3\n\n\n24B3\n\n\n27D10\n\n\n \nIgG2\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCoating\n\n\n33C3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n100\n\n\n29\n\n\n98\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody\n\n\n24B3\n\n\n−9\n\n\n102\n\n\n−14\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27D10\n\n\n103\n\n\n20\n\n\n103\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 23\n\n\nKDR Inhibitory Antibodies Reduce Tube Formation In Vitro\n\n\nKDR inhibitory antibodies were tested for the ability to reduce endothelial cell tube formation in an in vitro co-culture assay (TCS Cell Works Cat no. ZHA-1000). On day 1, Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) and human diploid fibroblasts were obtained as co-cultures in 24 well plates. KDR blocking antibodies were introduced to the cultures on day 1 and at regular intervals over an 11-day period at the following concentrations: 20 μg/mL, 5 μg/mL, 1.25 μg/mL and 0.3125 μg/mL. Media was replenished on \ndays\n 4, 7 and 9. The co-culture model was maintained in either TCS Optimised medium (supplied with the co-culture assay) or in MCDB131 medium supplemented with 2% foetal calf serum (FCS), 1% glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (hereafter referred to as 2% FS MCDB131 medium). The co-culture model was maintained at 37° C. in a humidified 5% CO\n2\n/95% air atmosphere.\n\n\nTubule formation was examined at day 11 following fixing and staining of tubules for CD31 using a tubule staining kit according to the manufacturors instructions (TCS Cell Works Cat no. ZHA-1225). Briefly, cells were fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT). Cells were blocked after which they were treated with anti-human CD31 for 60 minutes at RT. Plates were washed and treated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (AP) for 60 minutes at RT. After incubation with the AP-conjugated secondary antibody, the plates were washed and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) substrate was added for approximately 10 minutes. The development of a dark purple colour within 10 minutes reflected tubule formation. Plates were subsequently washed and left to air dry.\n\n\nQuantification of tubule growth was conducted by whole-well image analysis methodology using a Zeiss KS400 3.0 Image Analyser. The morphological parameter measured in the quantification methodology was total tubule length. All tubule formations within each of the 24 wells were measured excluding a rim of 100 μm depth to avoid edge retraction artifact.\n\n\nAs illustrated in \nFIG. 1\n, it was observed that the antibodies are effective in inhibiting endothelial cell tube formation in vitro. The data indicate that the antibodies are active in a functional assay that models the angiogenic process.\n\n\nExample 24\n\n\nDetermination of In Vivo Efficacy of Purified Antibodies\n\n\nEvaluation of the Antiangiogenic Efficacy in a Spheroid-Based In Vivo Angiogenesis Assay\n\n\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) spheroids were prepared as described earlier (Korff and Augustin: J Cell Biol 143: 1341-52, 1998) by pipetting 100 endothelial cells (EC) in a hanging drop on plastic dishes to allow overnight spheroid formation. The following day, using the method previously described (Alajati et al: Nature Methods 5:439-445, 2008), EC spheroids were harvested and mixed in a Matrigel/fibrin solution with single HUVECs to reach a final number of 100,000 ECs as spheroids and 200,000 single ECs per injected plug. VEGF-A and FGF-2 were added at a final concentration of 1000 ng/ml. Male SCID mice (5-8 weeks old) were subcutaneously injected with 500 μl of the cell/matrix suspension. The following day (day 1) treatment commenced. At day 21 the study was terminated. The matrix plugs were removed and fixed in 4% PFA. All matrix plugs were paraffin embedded and cut to a thickness of 8-10 μm for histological examination. Blood vessels were visualized by staining for human CD34 and smooth muscle actin (SMA) and the vessel density and pericyte coverage was determined\n\n\nAs illustrated in \nFIG. 2\n, the antibodies are effective in inhibiting vessel formation in vivo. The data indicate that the antibodies are active in an in vivo assay of angiogenesis.\n\n\nExample 25\n\n\nInhibition of Tumour Cell Growth in Human Patients\n\n\nA group of human cancer patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer is randomized into treatment groups. Each patient group is treated with weekly intravenous injections of fully human monoclonal antibodies against KDR as described herein. Each patient is dosed with an effective amount of the antibody ranging from 5 mg/kg/week to 15 mg/kg/week for 4-8 months. A control group is given only the standard chemotherapeutic regimen.\n\n\nAt periodic times during and after the treatment regimen, tumour burden is assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It can be expected that the patients who have received weekly antibody treatments will show significant reductions in tumour size, time delay to progression or prolonged survival compared to patients that do not receive antibody treatment. In some treated patients, it can be expected that the tumours are no longer detectable. In contrast, it can be expected that tumour size increases or remains substantially the same in the control group.\n\n\nExample 26\n\n\nInhibition of Colon Cancer in a Human Patient\n\n\nA group of human cancer patients diagnosed with colon cancer is randomized into treatment groups. Each patient group is treated 3-weekly with intravenous injections of fully human monoclonal antibodies against KDR as described herein. Each patient is dosed with an effective amount of the antibody ranging from 5 mg/kg/week to 15 mg/kg/week for 4-8 months. A control group is given only the standard chemotherapeutic regimen. At periodic times during and after the treatment regimen, tumour burden is assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It can be expected that the patients who have received 3-weekly antibody treatments show significant reductions in tumour size, time delay to progression or prolonged survival compared to patients that do not receive the antibody treatment. In some treated patients, it can be expected that the tumours are no longer detectable. In contrast, it can be expected that tumour size increases or remains substantially the same in the control group.\n\n\nExample 27\n\n\nInhibition of Melanoma in a Human Patient\n\n\nA group of human cancer patients diagnosed with melanoma is randomized into treatment groups.

It can be expected that the patients who have received 3-weekly antibody treatments with antibodies against KDR show significant reductions in melanoma, time delay to progression or prolonged survival compared to patients that do not receive the antibody treatment. In some treated patients, it can be expected that the melanoma lesions are no longer detectable. In contrast, it can be expected that melanoma increases or remains substantially the same in the control group.\n\n\nExample 28\n\n\nInhibition of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) in a Human Patient\n\n\nA group of human cancer patients diagnosed with CML is randomized into treatment groups. Each patient group is treated 3-weekly with intravenous injections of fully human monoclonal antibodies against KDR as described herein. Each patient is dosed with an effective amount of the antibody ranging from 5 mg/kg/week to 15 mg/kg/week for 4-8 months. A control group is given only the standard chemotherapeutic regimen. At periodic times during and after the treatment regimen, tumour burden is assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It can be expected that the patients who have received 3-weekly antibody treatments show significant reductions in CML, time delay to progression or prolonged survival compared to patients that do not receive the antibody treatment. In some treated patients, it can be expected that the CML is no longer detectable. In contrast, it can be expected that CML increases or remains substantially the same in the control group.\n\n\nExample 29\n\n\nInhibition of Tumour Cell Growth in a Human Patient\n\n\nA human patient is diagnosed with a malignant tumour.
