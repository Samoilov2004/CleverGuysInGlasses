Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides compounds for use in the treatment and prophylaxis of infection in mammals and avian species by Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C virus (HBV and HCV). In particular, the present invention enables a determination of whether, including a prediction of the level of likelihood that, a subject will respond to therapeutic or prophylactic intervention of HBV or HCV infection.\n\n\n \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBibliographic details of the publications referred to in this specification are also collected at the end of the description.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as, an acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in any country.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOver 170 million people are infected with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide, resulting in a large disease burden and significant mortality. HCV is rarely cleared in the acute phase of the infection and most patients become chronically infected; a proportion of these patients develop progressive liver disease and fibrosis. The outcome of infection depends on the immune responses of both the innate and cognate immune systems, and these in turn are orchestrated by networks of cytokines and chemokines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHepatitis B virus (HBV) also causes debilitating disease conditions and can lead to acute liver failure. HBV is a DNA virus which replicates \nvia\n an RNA intermediate and utilizes reverse transcription in its replication strategy. The HBV genome is of a complex nature having a partially double-stranded DNA structure with overlapping open reading frames encoding surface, core, polymerase and X genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe host virus relationship is a dynamic process in which many viruses such as HCV and HBV attempt to maximize their visibility while the host attempts to prevent and eradicate infection. Inititally, a virus must bind and enter a target cell and migrate to the appropriate cellular compartment in order to replicate and infect other cells. Infected cells may be triggered by the virus to produce cyokines (e.g. TNF-α and IFN-γ) that inhibit one or more stages of the viral replication cycle, thereby limiting the extent of the infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost monocytes and macrophages play a key role in the early response to the virus as they secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-18 that have indirect and direct effects on the infection. They can recruit further monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells and T-cells to perform functions and they can also help switch the to appropriate Th function to help eradicate the virus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInnate immunity to microbial pathogens, leading to the production of these pro-inflammatory cytokines, occurs as a result of the activation of Toll Like Receptors (TLRs). The role of TLRs involving bacterial products, e.g. endotoxin and peptidoglycan has recently been clarified (\nAkashi et al., J Immunol. 164: 3471-3475, 2000\n; \nTakeuchi et al., Immunity, 11: 443-451, 1999\n; \nTapping et al., J Immunol. 165: 5780-5787, 2000\n). More than 10 TLRs have been identified and they play an important role in activation by a number of different bacteria. Recently, this has been extended to viruses with the demonstration that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) stimulates TLR-4 in a murine model (\nKurt-Jones et al., Nat Immunol, 1: 398-401, 2000\n; \nHaeberle et al., J Infect Dis. 186: 1199-1206, 2002\n). In addition, Measles Virus (MV) has been shown to activate TLR-2 dependent signals (\nBieback et al., J Virol, 76: 8729-8736, 2002\n) and double-stranded DNA (the core of many viruses) has been shown to directly mediate responses to through TLR-3 (\nMatsumoto et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 293: 1364-1369, 2002\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCirculating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α are significantly increased in patients with cirrhosis and on-going liver injury (\nKhoruts et al., Hepatology 13: 267-276, 1991\n; \nTilg et al., Gastroenterology 103: 264-274, 1992\n; \nLee et al., Scand J Gastroenterol 31: 500-505, 1996\n; \nGenesca et al., Am J Gastroenterol. 94: 169-177, 1999\n; \nvon Baehr et al., Gut 47: 281-287, 2000\n; \nAndus et al., Hepatology 13: 364-375, 1991\n; \nEnomoto et al., J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 15(Suppl): D20-D25, 2000\n; \nNeuman et al., J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 17: 196-202, 2002\n). TNF-α has been shown to be a critical factor in the development of alcohol-induced acute liver injury in animal models (\nIimuro et al., Hepatology 26: 1530-1537, 1997\n; \nYin et al., Gastroenterology 117: 942-952, 1999\n). Activation of macrophages by endotoxin, a component of the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of TNF-α over-production and liver injury in such models (\nEnomoto et al., J. Biomed Sci. 8: 20-27, 2001\n). Several factors promote endotoxaemia in this setting, including increased translocation of endotoxin from the gut lumen and a reduction in hepatic clearance capacity (\nNanji et al., Am J Pathol. 142: 367-373, 1993\n; \nRivera et al., Am J Physiol. 275: G1252-1258, 1998\n). In the clinical setting, several studies have shown significant, though relatively modest, increases in circulating endotoxin levels in patients with cirrhosis (Khoruts \net al.,\n 1991, \nsupra;\n von Baehr \net al.,\n 2000, \nsupra\n; \nFukui et al., J Hepatol. 12: 162-169, 1991\n; \nLin et al., J Hepatol. 22: 165-172, 1995\n; \nChan et al., Scand J Gastroenterol. 32: 942-946, 1997\n; \nHanck et al., Gut 49: 106-111, 2001\n) and endotoxaemia has been assumed to be responsible for the increased circulating TNF-α levels in this group (Tilg \net al.,\n 1992, \nsupra\n; von Baehr \net al\n., 2000, \nsupra\n; \nSchafer et al., Z Gastroenterol. 33: 503-508, 1995\n; \nDeviere et al., Gastroenterology 103: 1296-1301, 1992\n). Endotoxaemia has also been assumed to be responsible for the elevated peripheral blood levels of anti-inflammatory mediators such as soluble TNF receptors (sTNFRs) found in cirrhosis (von Baehr \net al\n., 2000, \nsupra\n; \nTilg et al., Hepatology, 18: 1132-1138; 1993\n). Nonetheless, a significant correlation between circulating endotoxin and cytokine levels has generally not been demonstrated (Khoruts \net al\n, 1991, \nsupra;\n Tilg \net al\n, 1993, \nsupra\n; von Baehr \net al\n, 2000, \nsupra\n; Chan \net al\n., 1997, \nsupra)\n raising the possibility that, unlike in animal models, stimuli other than endotoxin may be important.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has recently been demonstrated that TNF-α production by macrophages in response to microbial stimuli is critically dependent upon activation of TLRs (\nMedzhitov et al., N Engl J Med. 343: 338-344, 2000\n; \nYoshimura et al., J Immunol. 163: 1-5, 1999\n; \nAkira et al., Nature Immunolog, 2: 675-680, 2001\n). As indicated above, TLRs play a critical role in the induction of innate immunity to microbial pathogens \nvia\n recognition of conserved molecular patterns. In particular, it is known that TLR-4, in association with CD14, is responsible for signal transduction leading to TNF-α production in response to endotoxin. In contrast, TLR-2 is required for signaling in response to a number of Gram-positive microbial stimuli, including whole bacteria and cell wall components such as peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) (Medzhitov \net al\n., 2000, \nsupra\n; Yoshimura \net al\n., 1999; \nsupra;\n Akira \net al\n., 2001, \nsupra)\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTLR-2 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has been shown to be increased in patients with liver cirrhosis (\nMarigold et al., Hepatology, 30: 434A, 1999\n), while TLR-4 expression has been reported to be down-regulated (\nMarigold et al., European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, 15: 275-282, 2003\n). This latter report also found intrahepatic expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4 to be unchanged in cirrhotic-liver patients. In a study using whole blood from alcoholic cirrhotics, enhanced sensitivity of circulating monocytes to TNF-α secreted in response to a low concentration of LPS was attributed to rapid up-regulation of TLR-4 cell surface expression in response to LPS (\nAustin et al., Gastroenterology, 122: A648-A649, 2002\n). TLR-2, TLR-4 and TLR-9 were amongst many genes found to be up-regulated in an analysis of the liver transcriptome of HCV-cirrhotic-liver patients (\nHuang et al., Hepatology, 36: 439A, 2002\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is a need to investigate the role of TLRs in infection with pathogenic entities such as microorganisms or viruses or other diseased states.\n\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThroughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word \"comprise\", or variations such as \"comprises\" or \"comprising\", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element or integer or group of elements or integers but not the exclusion of any other element or integer or group of elements or integers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present description identifies cell surface markers which are differentially affected in response to infection by a pathogenic organism or virus or in response to other disease conditions. The cell surface markers are, therefore, useful therapeutic and/or diagnostic targets. In particular, the present description identifies Toll-like receptors (TLRs) as being useful therapeutic and diagnostic markers for infection by pathogenic agents such as microorganisms and viruses or development of other disease conditions. In addition, the TLRs are useful indicators as to the potential responsiveness of a subject to therapeutic intervention including enabling a prediction as to the likelihood or otherwise of a subject responding favourably to therapeutic intervention. Such a prediction is a form of risk assessment. TLRs contain ectodomains with leucine-rich repeats and comprise intracellular motifs which are highly homologous to intracellular signaling domains of interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) and IL-1RI accessory protein. Eleven TLRs have so far been identified designated TLR-1 through TLR-11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been identified that TLRs, and in particular TLR-2 and TLR-4, are differentially affected on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in particular CD14+ PMBC (i.e. monocytes) and liver cells following infection by a pathogenic agent such as a microorganism or virus. TLRs and, in particular, TLR-2 and TLR-4 are, therefore, useful targets for therapeutic or prophylactic agents to treat or help prevent infection by a pathogenic agent. TLRs are also differentially affected in to other disease conditions such as but not limited to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). They are also useful diagnostic targets to determine whether a subject is or has been infected by a pathogenic entity or whether the subject is predisposed to or has a persistent infection or has another disease condition and can be used as a clinical or epidemiological management tool.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides, therefore, therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents capable of modulating levels of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 for use in treating a subject infected with HCV or HBV. For example, during infection with Hepatitis C virus (HCV), TLR-2 and TLR-4 levels are elevated in PBMCs and in particular monocytes and liver cells. Consequently, therapeutic and prophylactic agents may be designed or selected which down-regulate these TLRs. Conversely, infection with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) down-regulates TLR-2. Consequently, therapeutic agents may be designed or selected which up-regulate TLR-2 levels. In addition, TLR-2 levels are elevated in liver conditions such as cirrhosis or HCC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present description discloses methods for diagnosis or assessment of infection by a pathogenic agent such as a microorganism or virus by determining the levels of TLRs such as TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 on PBMCs and/or liver cells. In one example, the failure for TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 levels to alter (eg. increase or decrease) during early phase treatment provides an indication that the treatment protocol has some probability of not working.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides, therefore, therapeutic and diagnostic agents for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of a subject infected with HCV or HBV. The subject may be a mammal or avian species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides an \nin vitro\n diagnostic method for monitoring a response to treatment of a subject against HCV or HBV infection as well as for determining whether a subject will respond to an anti-HCV treatment or an anti-HBV treatment or for predicting the outcome of a therapeutic protocol directed against infection by HCV or HBV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred mammals are humans. Preferred avian species are poultry birds.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \nFigures 1A and 1B\n \n are graphical representations showing TLR profiles in control subjects and patients with CHC. Whole blood was stained with directly conjugated antibodies to CD14 and either TLR-2 or TLR-4. Diagrams represent 10,000 CD14-gated cells. The solid line represents expression of the isotype control, the dotted line the control subject and the dashed line the CHC patient.\n\n\n \n \nFigures 2A and 2B\n \n are graphical representations showing TLR-4 and TLR-2 expression on CD14\n+ve\n peripheral blood monocytes in control subjects and patients with HCV infection. TLR-2 and TLR-4 expression was significantly increased in patients with HCV infection.\n\n\n \n \nFigure 3\n \n is a graphical representation of data from 6 patients showing \nin vitro\n expression in peripheral blood of TNF-α (\nFigure 3\n a and b), TLR2 (\nFigure 3c and d\n) and TLR4 (\nFigure 3e and f\n) following stimulation with HBV. In which each of b,d and f shows a graphical representation of the average stimulation.\n\n\n \n \nFigure 4\n \n is a graphical representation showing \nin vitro\n expression of TLR2 and \nTLR\n 4 in HepG2 cells following transduction with recombinant HBV/ baculovirus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is predicated in part on the determination that levels of particular cell surface markers correlate with infection by particular pathogenic entities such as microorganisms or viruses. More particularly, the present description discloses that TLR genes are differentially expressed during infection by pathogenic entities such as microorganisms or viruses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been observed that infection by HCV results in elevated levels of TLR-2 and TLR-4 in CD14+ PBMCs (i.e. monocytes) and liver cells. The elevated levels of TLR-2 and TLR-4 may be used as a diagnostic indicator of HCV infection or a predisposition to or persistence of HCV infection. The level of the TLRs are also useful indications of the likelihood that a subject will respond favourably to the therapeutic intervention. Reference to \"likelihood\" includes making a prediction and making risk assessment of the likelihood or otherwise of success of the treatment protocol. Additionally, TLR-2 and TLR-4 become therapeutic targets for agents which down-regulate TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has further been observed that infection by HBV results in down-regulation of TLR-2 in CD14+ PBMCs and liver cells. Again, this enables the level of TLR-2 to be used as a diagnostic marker for HBV infection and as a target for agents to up-regulate TLR-2 in subjects infected by HBV or who have a predisposition to or persistence of infection with HBV. Normalization of levels of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 is a prediction that a treatment protocol is working. Comparisons are conveniently made to pre-treatment levels or a database of normalized controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides, therefore, agents which modulate levels of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 for use in treating a subject infected with HCV or HBV, and \nin vitro\n diagnostic methods involving determining the levels of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4. Monitoring a therapeutic regimen and determining a subject's predisposition to or persistence of infection by a pathogenic entity, is contemplated by the present disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides an \nin vitro\n diagnostic method for monitoring a response to treatment of a subject against HCV or HBV infection as well as for determining whether a subject will respond to an anti-HCV treatment or an anti-HBV treatment or for predicting the outcome of a therapeutic protocol directed against infection by HCV or HBV. The present invention may be useful as a clinical or epidemiological management tool for HBV and/or HCV infection in animals such as mammals and in particular humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present description discloses a method for detecting the presence of infection by a pathogenic agent or a predisposition thereto, said method comprising determining the level of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 or a homolog thereof wherein an elevated or reduced level of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 or a homolog thereof is indicative of infection by the pathogenic agent or predisposition thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides an \nin vitro\n diagnostic method for monitoring a response to treatment of a subject against HCV or HBV infection said method comprising determining the level of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 wherein the efficacy of the anti-HBV treatment is determined by an elevation in the level of TLR-2 and the efficacy of the anti-HCV treatment is determined by a reduction in the level of TLR-2 and TLR-4 compared to pre-treatment levels and/or standardized controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect provides an \nin vitro\n diagnostic method for determining whether a subject will respond to an anti-HCV treatment or an anti-HBV treatment said method comprising determining the level of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 wherein the potential efficacy of the treatment is determined by an elevated level of TLR-2 and TLR-4 in a subject with HCV and a reduced level of TLR-2 in a subject with HBV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStill yet a further aspect provides an \nin vitro\n diagnostic method for predicting the outcome of a therapeutic protocol directed against infection by HCV or HBV said method comprising determining the level of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 wherein the efficacy of the therapeutic protocol is determined by an elevation in the level of TLR-2 during anti-HBV treatment and by a reduction in the level of TLR-2 and TLR-4 during anti-HCV treatment compared to pre-treatment levels and/or standardized controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the risk assessment aspects disclosed herein, one would expect change in early phase treatment to result in a change or a trend to change levels of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4. When that occurs, the likelihood of successful therapeutic intervention is considered reasonable to high. If there is no trend to alter the TLR levels then this is an indication of a less than successful therapeutic protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that unless otherwise indicated, the subject invention is not limited to specific formulations of components, manufacturing methods, dosage regimens, or the like, as such may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt must be noted that, as used in the subject specification, the singular forms \"a\", \"an\" and \"the\" include plural aspects unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to a \"compound\" includes a single compound, as well as two or more compounds; reference to \"an active agent\" includes a single active agent, as well as two or more active agents; and so forth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn describing and claiming the present invention and other aspects disclosed herein, the following terminology are used in accordance with the definitions set forth below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"compound\", \"active agent\", \"pharmacologically active agent\", \"medicament\", \"active\" and \"drug\" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a chemical compound that induces a desired pharmacological and/or physiological effect. The terms also encompass pharmaceutically acceptable and pharmacologically active ingredients of those active agents specifically mentioned herein including but not limited to salts, esters, amides, prodrugs, active metabolites, analogs and the like. When the terms \"compound\", \"active agent\", \"pharmacologically active agent\", \"medicament\", \"active\" and \"drug\" are used, then it is to be understood that this includes the active agent \nper se\n as well as pharmaceutically acceptable, pharmacologically active salts, esters, amides, prodrugs, metabolites, analogs, etc. The term \"compound\" is not to be construed as a chemical compound only but extends to peptides, polypeptides and proteins as well as genetic molecules such as RNA, DNA and chemical analogs thereof. Reference to a \"peptide\", \"polypeptide\" or \"protein\" includes molecules with a polysaccharide or lipopolysaccharide component. The term \"potentiator\" is an example of a compound, active agent, pharmacologically active agent, medicament, active and drug which up-regulates the level of a TLR such as TLR-2 or TLR-4. The term \"up-regulates\" encompasses increasing expression of a TLR gene as well as manipulating a component of the downstream signaling pathway. The term \"antagonist\" is an example of a compound, active agent, pharmacologically active agent, medicament, active and drug which down-regulates the level of a TLR, such as TLR-2 or TLR-4. Down-regulation may also involve elevating levels of an inhibitor of the TLR signaling pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, reference to a TLR also includes reference to the signaling pathway associated with interaction between a ligand and a TLR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present description contemplates, therefore, compounds useful in up-regulating a TLR such as TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 or general or specific TLR signaling. The terms \"modulating\" or its derivatives, such as \"modulate\" or \"modulation\", are used to describe up- or down-regulation. The compounds have an effect on reducing or preventing or treating infection by a pathogenic organism or virus. Examples of cells which carry the TLRs to be modulated are PBMCs and liver cells. A PBMC includes a CD14+ PMBC and in particular a monocyte and a liver cell includes a hepatocyte. Reference to a \"compound\", \"active agent\", \"pharmacologically active agent\", \"medicament\", \"active\" and \"drug\" includes combinations of two or more actives such as a potentiator or antagonist of TLR or TLR signaling. A \"combination\" also includes multi-part such as a two-part pharmaceutical composition where the agents are provided separately and given or dispensed separately or admixed together prior to dispensation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a multi-part pharmaceutical pack may have a modulator of a TLR and one or more anti-microbial or anti-viral agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"effective amount\" and \"therapeutically effective amount\" of an agent as used herein mean a sufficient amount of the agent to provide the desired therapeutic or physiological effect. Furthermore, an \"effective TLR-potentiating amount\" or an \"effective TLR-antagonizing amount\" of an agent is a sufficient amount of the agent to directly or indirectly up-regulate or down-regulate the function of a specific TLR such a TLR-2 or TLR-4 or to disrupt or potentiate TLR signaling. This may be accomplished by the agents acting as an agonist or antagonist of the TLR or its signaling components, by the agents which are or mimic components of the TLR signaling pathway, by agents which induce the TLR signaling pathway \nvia\n other cellular receptors or by the agents antagonizing inhibitors of TLR signaling componets. Undesirable effects, e.g. side effects, are sometimes manifested along with the desired therapeutic effect; hence, a practitioner balances the potential benefits against the potential risks in determining what is an appropriate \"effective amount\". The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age and general condition of the subject, mode of administration and the like. Thus, it may not be possible to specify an exact \"effective amount\". However, an appropriate \"effective amount\" in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" carrier, excipient or diluent is meant a pharmaceutical vehicle comprised of a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e. the material may be administered to a subject along with the selected active agent without causing any or a substantial adverse reaction. Carriers may include excipients and other additives such as diluents, detergents, coloring agents, wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, preservatives, and the like. A pharmaceutical composition may also be described depending on the formulation as a vaccine composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, a \"pharmacologically acceptable\" salt, ester, emide, prodrug or derivative of a compound as provided herein is a salt, ester, amide, prodrug or derivative that this not biologically or otherwise undesirable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"treating\" and \"treatment\" as used herein refer to reduction in severity and/or frequency of symptoms of infection or disease, elimination of symptoms and/or underlying cause, prevention of the occurrence of symptoms of infection and/or their underlying cause and improvement or remediation of damage. Collateral damage, for example, following viral infection may be liver damage such as cirrhosis or HCC of the liver.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Treating\" a patient may involve prevention of infection or other disease condition or adverse physiological event in a susceptible individual as well as treatment of a clinically symptomatic individual by inhibiting an infection or other disease condition or downstream condition such as liver damage or cancer. In the present invention, such a condition or disorder is infection by HBV or HCV. Thus, for example, as disclosed herein the method of \"treating\" a patient with an infection or with a propensity for one to develop encompasses both prevention of the infection as well as treating the infection once established.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the present invention the infection is by HBV or HCV. Reference to \"HBV\" or \"HCV\" or their full terms such as \"Hepatitis B virus\" or \"Hepatitis C virus\" include all variants including variants resistant to particular therapeutic agents such as nucleoside analogs or immunological agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Patient\" as used herein refers to an animal, preferably a mammal and more preferably human who can benefit from the pharmaceutical formulations and methods disclosed herein. There is no limitation on the type of animal that could benefit from the presently described pharmaceutical formulations and methods. A patient regardless of whether a human or non-human animal may be referred to as an individual, subject, animal, host or recipient. The compounds and methods disclosed herein have applications in human medicine, veterinary medicine as well as in general, domestic or wild animal husbandry. For convenience, an \"animal\" includes an avian species such as a poultry bird, an aviary bird or game bird. A poultry bird such as a duck is a preferred example of an avian species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds (agents) contemplated by the present description may be large or small molecules, nucleic acid molecules (including antisense or sense molecules), peptides, polypeptides or proteins or hybrid molecules such as RNAi- or siRNA-complexes, ribozymes or DNAzymes. The compounds may need to be modified so as to facilitate entry into a cell. This is not a requirement if the compound interacts with an extracellular receptor. Examples of such agents include chemical agents and antibodies which interact with the TLR or genetic molecules which down-regulate or up-regulate expression of a gene encoding a TLR or compound of a TLR signaling pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred agents for use in the invention are selected from an antibody specific for TLR-2 or TLR-4 or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, a sense or antisense nucleic acid molecule to TLR-2 or TLR-4 and RNAi, siRNA, a ribozyme or a DNAzyme to TLR-2 or TLR-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs indicated above, the preferred animals are humans or other primates, livestock animals, laboratory test animals, companion animals or captive wild animals, as well as avian species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of laboratory test animals include mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs and hamsters. Rabbits and rodent animals, such as rats and mice, provide a convenient test system or animal model. Livestock animals include sheep, cows, pigs, goats, horses and donkeys. Non-mammalian animals such as avian species (such as ducks), zebrafish, amphibians (including cane toads) and \nDrosophila\n species such as \nDrosophila melanogaster\n are also contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present description discloses, therefore, agents which antagonize or agonize (ie. potentiate or activate) TLRs such as TLR-2 and/or TLR-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present description discloses methods of screening for such agents comprising, for example, contacting a candidate drug with a TLR such as TLR-2 or TLR-4 or a part thereof. Such a TLR molecule is referred to herein as a \"target\" or \"target molecule\". The screening procedure includes assaying (i) for the presence of a complex between the drug and the target, or (ii) an alteration in the expression levels of nucleic acid molecules encoding the target. One form of assay involves competitive binding assays. In such competitive binding assays, the target is typically labeled. Free target is separated from any putative complex and the amount of free (i.e. uncomplexed) label is a measure of the binding of the agent being tested to target molecule. One may also measure the amount of bound, rather than free, target. It is also possible to label the compound rather than the target and to measure the amount of compound binding to target in the presence and in the absence of the drug being tested. Such compounds may inhibit the target which is useful, for example, in finding inhibitors of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 required for treating HCV infection or other disease condition or may protect TLR-2 or other components from being inhibited which would be required for treating HBV infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother technique for drug screening provides high throughput screening for compounds having suitable binding affinity to a target and is described in detail in Geysen (International Patent Publication No. \n \nWO 84/03564\n \n). Briefly stated, large numbers of different small peptide test compounds are synthesized on a solid substrate, such as plastic pins or some other surface. The peptide test compounds are reacted with a target and washed. Bound target molecule is then detected by methods well known in the art. This method may be adapted for screening for non-peptide, chemical entities. This method, therefore, extends to combinatorial approaches to screening for target antagonists or agonists of TLRs such as TLR-2 or TLR-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurified target can be coated directly onto plates for use in the aforementioned drug screening techniques. However, non-neutralizing antibodies to the target may also be used to immobilize the target on the solid phase. Antibodies specific for a TLR, such as TLR-2 or TLR-4, may also be useful as inhibitors of these TLRs such as in the treatment of HCV infection or other disease condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present description also discloses the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralizing antibodies capable of specifically binding the target compete with a test compound for binding to the target or fragments thereof. In this manner, the antibodies can be used to detect the presence of any peptide which shares one or more antigenic determinants of the target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies to a TLR, specifically TLR-2 or TLR-4 provided for by the invention, may be polyclonal or monoclonal although monoclonal antibodies are preferred. Antibodies may be prepared by any of a number of means. For the detection of a TLR, antibodies are generally but not necessarily derived from non-human animals such as primates, livestock animals (e.g. sheep, cows, pigs, goats, horses), laboratory test animals (e.g. mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits) and companion animals (e.g. dogs, cats). Generally, antibody based assays are conducted \nin vitro\n on cell or tissue biopsies. However, if an antibody is suitably deimmunized or, in the case of human use, humanized, then the antibody can be labeled with, for example, a nuclear tag, administered to a subject and the site of nuclear label accumulation determined by radiological techniques. The TLR antibody is regarded, therefore, as a pathogenic marker targeting agent. Accordingly, deimmunized forms of the antibodies may be used in pathogenic target imaging in human and non-human subjects. This is described further below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the generation of antibodies to TLR, the enzyme is required to be extracted from a biological sample whether this be from animal including human tissue or from cell culture if produced by recombinant means. Generally, monocytes and hepatocytes are a convenient source. The TLR can be separated from the biological sample by any suitable means. For example, the separation may take advantage of any one or more of TLR's surface charge properties, size, density, biological activity and its affinity for another entity (e.g. another protein or chemical compound to which it binds or otherwise associates). Thus, for example, separation of TLR from the biological sample may be achieved by any one or more of ultra-centrifugation, ion-exchange chromatography (e.g. anion exchange chromatography, cation exchange chromatography), electrophoresis (e.g. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focussing), size separation (e.g., gel filtration, ultrafiltration) and affinity-mediated separation (e.g. immunoaffinity separation including, but not limited to, magnetic bead separation such as Dynabead (trademark) separation, immunochromatography, immuno-precipitation). Choice of the separation technique(s) employed may depend on the biological activity or physical properties of the particular TLR sought or from which tissues it is obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the separation of TLR from the biological fluid preserves conformational epitopes present on the kinase and, thus, suitably avoids techniques that cause denaturation of the enzyme. Persons of skill in the art will recognize the importance of maintaining or mimicking as close as possible physiological conditions peculiar to the TLR (e.g. the biological sample from which it is obtained) to ensure that the antigenic determinants or active site/s on the TLR, which are exposed to the animal, are structurally identical to that of the native enzyme. This ensures the raising of appropriate antibodies in the immunized animal that would recognize the native enzyme.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunization and subsequent production of monoclonal antibodies can be carried out using standard protocols as for example described by Köhler and Milstein (\nKohler and Milstein, Nature 256: 495-499, 1975\n; \nKohler and Milstein, Eur. J. Immunol. 6(7): 511-519, 1976\n), \nColigan et al. (\"Current Protocols in Immunology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1991-1997\n) or \nToyama et al. (Monoclonal Antibody, Experiment Manual\", published by Kodansha Scientific, 1987\n). Essentially, an animal is immunized with a TLR or a sample comprising a TLR by standard methods to produce antibody-producing cells, particularly antibody-producing somatic cells (e.g. B lymphocytes). These cells can then be removed from the immunized animal for immortalization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere a fragment of TLR is used to generate antibodies, it may need to first be associated with a carrier. By \"carrier\" is meant any substance of typically high molecular weight to which a non- or poorly immunogenic substance (e.g. a hapten) is naturally or artificially linked to enhance its immunogenicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmortalization of antibody-producing cells may be carried out using methods which are well-known in the art. For example, the immortalization may be achieved by the transformation method using Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (\nKozbor et al., Methods in Enzymology 121: 140, 1986\n). Preferably, antibody-producing cells are immortalized using the cell fusion method (described in Coligan \net al\n., 1991-1997, \nsupra\n), which is widely employed for the production of monoclonal antibodies. In this method, somatic antibody-producing cells with the potential to produce antibodies, particularly B cells, are fused with a myeloma cell line. These somatic cells may be derived from the lymph nodes, spleens and peripheral blood of primed animals, preferably rodent animals such as mice and rats. Mice spleen cells are particularly useful. It would be possible, however, to use rat, rabbit, sheep or goat cells, or cells from other animal species instead.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecialized myeloma cell lines have been developed from lymphocytic tumours for use in hybridoma-producing fusion procedures (Kohler and Milstein, 1976, \nsupra\n; \nShulman et al., Nature 276: 269-270, 1978\n; \nVolk et al., J. Virol. 42(1): 220-227, 1982\n). These cell lines have been developed for at least three reasons. The first is to facilitate the selection of fused hybridomas from unfused and similarly indefinitely self-propagating myeloma cells. Usually, this is accomplished by using myelomas with enzyme deficiencies that render them incapable of growing in certain selective media that support the growth of hybridomas. The second reason arises from the inherent ability of lymphocytic tumour cells to produce their own antibodies. To eliminate the production of tumour cell antibodies by the hybridomas, myeloma cell lines incapable of producing endogenous light or heavy immunoglobulin chains are used. A third reason for selection of these cell lines is for their suitability and efficiency for fusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany myeloma cell lines may be used for the production of fused cell hybrids, including, e.g. P3X63-Ag8, P3X63-AG8.653, P3/NS1-Ag4-1 (NS-1), Sp2/0-Ag14 and S194/5.XXO.Bu.1. The P3X63-Ag8 and NS-1 cell lines have been described by Köhler and Milstein (1976, \nsupra\n). Shulman \net al\n. (1978, \nsupra\n) developed the Sp2/0-Ag14 myeloma line. The S194/5.XXO.Bu.1 line was reported by \nTrowbridge (J. Exp. Med. 148(1): 313-323, 1978\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for generating hybrids of antibody-producing spleen or lymph node cells and myeloma cells usually involve mixing somatic cells with myeloma cells in a 10:1 proportion (although the proportion may vary from about 20:1 to about 1:1), respectively, in the presence of an agent or agents (chemical, viral or electrical) that promotes the fusion of cell membranes. Fusion methods have been described (Kohler and Milstein, 1975, \nsupra\n; Kohler and Milstein, 1976, \nsupra\n; \nGefter et al., Somatic Cell Genet. 3: 231-236, 1977\n; Volk \net al\n., 1982, \nsupra\n). The fusion-promoting agents used by those investigators were Sendai virus and polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause fusion procedures produce viable hybrids at very low frequency (e.g. when spleens are used as a source of somatic cells, only one hybrid is obtained for roughly every 1x10\n5\n spleen cells), it is preferable to have a means of selecting the fused cell hybrids from the remaining unfused cells, particularly the unfused myeloma cells. A means of detecting the desired antibody-producing hybridomas among other resulting fused cell hybrids is also necessary. Generally, the selection of fused cell hybrids is accomplished by culturing the cells in media that support the growth of hybridomas but prevent the growth of the unfused myeloma cells, which normally would go on dividing indefinitely. The somatic cells used in the fusion do not maintain long-term viability in \nin vitro\n culture and hence do not pose a problem. In the example of the present invention, myeloma cells lacking hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT-negative) were used. Selection against these cells is made in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine (HAT) medium, a medium in which the fused cell hybrids survive due to the HPRT-positive genotype of the spleen cells. The use of myeloma cells with different genetic deficiencies (drug sensitivities, etc.) that can be selected against in media supporting the growth of genotypically competent hybrids is also possible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral weeks are required to selectively culture the fused cell hybrids. Early in this time period, it is necessary to identify those hybrids which produce the desired antibody, so that they may subsequently be cloned and propagated. Generally, around 10% of the hybrids obtained produce the desired antibody, although a range of from about 1 to about 30% is not uncommon. The detection of antibody-producing hybrids can be achieved by any one of several standard assay methods, including enzyme-linked immunoassay and radioimmunoassay techniques as, for example, described in \nKennet et al. (Monoclonal Antibodies and Hybridomas: A New Dimension in Biological Analyses, pp 376-384, Plenum Press, New York, 1980\n) and by FACS analysis (\nO'Reilly et al., Biotechniques 25: 824-830, 1998\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the desired fused cell hybrids have been selected and cloned into individual antibody-producing cell lines, each cell line may be propagated in either of two standard ways. A suspension of the hybridoma cells can be injected into a histocompatible animal. The injected animal will then develop tumours that secrete the specific monoclonal antibody produced by the fused cell hybrid. The body fluids of the animal, such as serum or ascites fluid, can be tapped to provide monoclonal antibodies in high concentration. Alternatively, the individual cell lines may be propagated \nin vitro\n in laboratory culture vessels. The culture medium containing high concentrations of a single specific monoclonal antibody can be harvested by decantation, filtration or centrifugation, and subsequently purified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cell lines are tested for their specificity to detect the TLR of interest by any suitable immunodetection means. For example, cell lines can be aliquoted into a number of wells and incubated and the supernatant from each well is analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect fluorescent antibody technique, or the like. The cell line(s) producing a monoclonal antibody capable of recognizing the target TLR but which does not recognize non-target epitopes are identified and then directly cultured \nin vitro\n or injected into a histocompatible animal to form tumours and to produce, collect and purify the required antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese antibodies are TLR-specific. This means that the antibodies are capable of distinguishing a particular TLR from other molecules. More broad spectrum antibodies may be used provided that they do not cross-react with molecules in a normal cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the monoclonal antibody is destined for use as a therapeutic agent such as to inhibit TLR-2 or TLR-4, then, it will need to be deimmunized with respect to the host into which it will be introduced (e.g. a human). The deimmunization process may take any of a number of forms including the preparation of chimeric antibodies which have the same or similar specificity as the monoclonal antibodies prepared according to the present invention. Chimeric antibodies are antibodies whose light and heavy chain genes have been constructed, typically by genetic engineering, from immunoglobulin variable and constant region genes belonging to different species. Thus, once a hybridoma producing the desired monoclonal antibody is obtained, techniques are used to produce interspecific monoclonal antibodies wherein the binding region of one species is combined with a non-binding region of the antibody of another species (\nLiu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84: 3439-3443, 1987\n). For example, complementary determining regions (CDRs) from a non-human (e.g. murine) monoclonal antibody can be grafted onto a human antibody, thereby \"humanizing\" the murine antibody (European Patent No. \n \n0 239 400\n \n; \nJones et al., Nature 321: 522-525, 1986\n; \nVerhoeyen et al., Science 239: 1534-1536, 1988\n; \nRichmann et al., Nature 332: 323-327, 1988\n). In this case, the deimmunizing process is specific for humans. More particularly, the CDRs can be grafted onto a human antibody variable region with or without human constant regions. The non-human antibody providing the CDRs is typically referred to as the \"donor\" and the human antibody providing the framework is typically referred to as the \"acceptor\". Constant regions need not be present, but if they are, they must be substantially identical to human immunoglobulin constant regions, i.e. at least about 85-90%, preferably about 95% or more identical. Hence, all parts of a humanized antibody, except possibly the CDRs, are substantially identical to corresponding parts of natural human immunoglobulin sequences. Thus, a \"humanized antibody\" is an antibody comprising a humanized light chain and a humanized heavy chain immunoglobulin. A donor antibody is said to be \"humanized\", by the process of \"humanization\", because the resultant humanized antibody is expected to bind to the same antigen as the donor antibody that provides the CDRs. Reference herein to \"humanized\" includes reference to an antibody deimmunized to a particular host, in this case, a human host.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood that the deimmunized antibodies may have additional conservative amino acid substitutions which have substantially no effect on antigen binding or other immunoglobulin functions. Exemplary conservative substitutions may be made according to Table 1.\n\n \n \nTABLE 1\n \n \n \n \n \nORIGINAL RESIDUE\n \n \n \nEXEMPLARY SUBSTITUTIONS\n \n \n \n \n \nAla\n \nSer\n \n \n \nArg\n \nLys\n \n \n \nAsn\n \nGln, His\n \n \n \nAsp\n \nGlu\n \n \n \nCys\n \nSer\n \n \n \nGln\n \nAsn\n \n \n \nGlu\n \nAsp\n \n \n \nGly\n \nPro\n \n \n \nHis\n \nAsn, Gln\n \n \n \nIle\n \nLeu, Val\n \n \n \nLeu\n \nIle, Val\n \n \n \nLys\n \nArg, Gln, Glu\n \n \n \nMet\n \nLeu, Ile\n \n \n \nPhe\n \nMet, Leu, Tyr\n \n \n \nSer\n \nThr\n \n \n \nThr\n \nSer\n \n \n \nTrp\n \nTyr\n \n \n \nTyr\n \nTrp, Phe\n \n \n \nVal\n \nIle, Leu\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary methods which may be employed to produce deimmunized antibodies are described, for example, in Richmann \net al\n., 1988, \nsupra\n; European Patent No. \n \n0 239 400\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,056,957\n \n, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,180,370\n \n, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,180,377\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the present description contemplates a deimmunized antibody molecule having specificity for an epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody to a TLR such as TLR-2 or TLR-4 wherein at least one of the CDRs of the variable domain of said deimmunized antibody is derived from the said monoclonal antibody to said TLR and the remaining immunoglobulin-derived parts of the deimmunized antibody molecule are derived from an immunoglobulin or an analog thereof from the host for which the antibody is to be deimmunized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe development of a deimmunized antibody involves manipulation of the framework region of a non-human antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies disclosed herein extend to mutants and derivatives of the subject antibodies but which still retain specificity for TLR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"mutant\" or \"derivatives\" includes one or more amino acid substitutions, additions and/or deletions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"CDR\" includes CDR structural loops which covers to the three light chain and the three heavy chain regions in the variable portion of an antibody framework region which bridge β strands on the binding portion of the molecule. These loops have characteristic canonical structures (\nChothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 196: 901, 1987\n; \nChothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 227: 799, 1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"framework region\" is meant region of an immunoglobulin light or heavy chain variable region, which is interrupted by three hypervariable regions, also called CDRs. The extent of the framework region and CDRs have been precisely defined (see, for example, \nKabat et al., \"\nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest\n\", U.S. Department of Health and Human Sciences, 1983\n). The sequences of the framework regions of different light or heavy chains are relatively conserved within a species. As used herein, a \"human framework region\" is a framework region that is substantially identical (about 85% or more, usually 90-95% or more) to the framework region of a naturally occurring human immunoglobulin. The framework region of an antibody, that is the combined framework regions of the constituent light and heavy chains, serves to position and align the CDRs. The CDRs are primarily responsible for binding to an epitope of the TLR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"heavy chain variable region\" means a polypeptide which is from about 110 to 125 amino acid residues in length, the amino acid sequence of which corresponds to that of a heavy chain of a monoclonal antibody of the invention, starting from the amino-terminal (N-terminal) amino acid residue of the heavy chain. Likewise, the term \"light chain variable region\" means a polypeptide which is from about 95 to 130 amino acid residues in length, the amino acid sequence of which corresponds to that of a light chain of a monoclonal antibody of the invention, starting from the N-terminal amino acid residue of the light chain. Full-length immunoglobulin \"light chains\" (about 25 Kd or 214 amino acids) are encoded by a variable region gene at the NH\n2\n-terminus (about 110 amino acids) and a κ or λ constant region gene at the COOH-terminus. Full-length immunoglobulin \"heavy chains\" (about 50 Kd or 446 amino acids), are similarly encoded by a variable region gene (about 116 amino acids) and one of the other aforementioned constant region genes, e.g. γ (encoding about 330 amino acids).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"immunoglobulin\" or \"antibody\" is used herein to refer to a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the κ, λ, α. γ (IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, IgG\n4\n), δ. ε and µ constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. One form of immunoglobulin constitutes the basic structural unit of an antibody. This form is a tetramer and consists of two identical pairs of immunoglobulin chains, each pair having one light and one heavy chain. In each pair, the light and heavy chain variable regions are together responsible for binding to an antigen, and the constant regions are responsible for the antibody effector functions. In addition to antibodies, immunoglobulins may exist in a variety of other forms including, for example, Fv, Fab, Fab' and (Fab')\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention contemplates the use of fragments of monoclonal antibodies produced as disclosed herein including, for example, Fv, Fab, Fab' and F(ab')\n2\n fragments. Such fragments may be prepared by standard methods as for example described by Coligan \net al\n. (1991-1997, \nsupra\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present methods disclosed herein may use synthetic or recombinant antigen-binding molecules with the same or similar specificity as the monoclonal antibodies of the invention. Antigen-binding molecules of this type may comprise a synthetic stabilized Fv fragment. Exemplary fragments of this type include single chain Fv fragments (sFv, frequently termed scFv) in which a peptide linker is used to bridge the N terminus or C terminus of a V\n \nH\n \n domain with the C terminus or N-terminus, respectively, of a V\n \nL\n \n domain. ScFv lack all constant parts of whole antibodies and are not able to activate complement. Suitable peptide linkers for joining the V\n \nH\n \n and V\n \nL\n \n domains are those which allow the V\n \nH\n \n and V\n \nL\n \n domains to fold into a single polypeptide chain having an antigen binding site with a three dimensional structure similar to that of the antigen binding site of a whole antibody from which the Fv fragment is derived. Linkers having the desired properties may be obtained by the method disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No 4,946,778\n \n. However, in some cases a linker is absent. ScFvs may be prepared, for example, in accordance with methods outlined in \nKrebber et al. (J. Immunol. Methods 201(1): 35-55,1997\n). Alternatively, they may be prepared by methods described in \n \nU.S. Patent No 5,091,513\n \n, European Patent No \n \n239,400\n \n or the articles by \nWinter and Milstein (Nature 349: 293, 1991\n) and \nPlückthun et al. (In Antibody engineering: A practical approach, 203-252, 1996\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the synthetic stabilized Fv fragment comprises a disulphide stabilized Fv (dsFv) in which cysteine residues are introduced into the V\n \nH\n \n and V\n \nL\n \n domains such that in the fully folded Fv molecule the two residues will form a disulphide bond therebetween. Suitable methods of producing dsFv are described, for example, in (\nGlockshuber et al., Biochem. 29: 1363-1367, 1990\n;\n Reiter et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269: 18327-18331, 1994\n; \nReiter et al., Biochem. 33: 5451-5459, 1994\n; \nReiter et al., Cancer Res. 54: 2714-2718, 1994\n; \nWebber et al., Mol. Immunol. 32: 249-258, 1995\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso contemplated as synthetic or recombinant antigen-binding molecules are single variable region domains (termed dAbs) as, for example, disclosed in (\nWard et al., Nature 341: 544-546, 1989\n; \nHamers-Casterman et al., Nature 363: 446-448; 1993\n; \nDavies & Riechmann, FEBS Lett. 339: 285-290, 1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the synthetic or recombinant antigen-binding molecule may comprise a \"minibody\". In this regard, minibodies are small versions of whole antibodies, which encode in a single chain the essential elements of a whole antibody. Suitably, the minibody is comprised of the V\n \nH\n \n and V\n \nL\n \n domains of a native antibody fused to the hinge region and CH3 domain of the immunoglobulin molecule as, for example, disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No 5,837,821\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a further alternative, the synthetic or recombinant antigen binding molecule may comprise non-immunoglobulin derived, protein frameworks. For example, reference may be made to (\nKu & Schutz, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92: 6552-6556, 1995\n) which discloses a four-helix bundle protein cytochrome b562 having two loops randomized to create CDRs, which have been selected for antigen binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthetic or recombinant antigen-binding molecule may be multivalent (i.e. having more than one antigen binding site). Such multivalent molecules may be specific for one or more antigens. Multivalent molecules of this type may be prepared by dimerization of two antibody fragments through a cysteinyl-containing peptide as, for example disclosed by (\nAdams et al., Cancer Res. 53: 4026-4034, 1993\n; \nCumber et al., J. Immunol. 149: 120-126, 1992\n). Alternatively, dimerization may be facilitated by fusion of the antibody fragments to amphiphilic helices that naturally dimerize (\nPlüockthun, Biochem 31: 1579-1584, 1992\n) or by use of domains (such as leucine zippers jun and fos) that preferentially heterodimerize (\nKostelny et al., J. Immunol. 148: 1547-1553, 1992\n). Multivalent antibodies are useful, for example, in detecting different forms of TLRs such as TLR-2 and TLR-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another useful source of compounds useful in modulating TLR activity is a chemically modified ligand such as a cytokine or other activator of TLR which may then in turn activate or inhibit a TLR pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, compounds can be selected which interrupt or antagonize or agonize the interaction between a TLR and its ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalogs of proteinaceous molecules (e.g. ligands of a TLR) contemplated herein include but are not limited to modification to side chains, incorporating of unnatural amino acids and/or their derivatives during peptide, polypeptide or protein synthesis and the use of crosslinkers and other methods which impose conformational constraints on the proteinaceous molecule or their analogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of side chain modifications contemplated herein include modifications of amino groups such as by reductive alkylation by reaction with an aldehyde followed by reduction with NaBH\n4\n; amidination with methylacetimidate; acylation with acetic anhydride; carbamoylation of amino groups with cyanate; trinitrobenzylation of amino groups with 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS); acylation of amino groups with succinic anhydride and tetrahydrophthalic anhydride; and pyridoxylation of lysine with pyridoxal-5-phosphate followed by reduction with NaBH\n4\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe guanidine group of arginine residues may be modified by the formation of heterocyclic condensation products with reagents such as 2,3-butanedione, phenylglyoxal and glyoxal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe carboxyl group may be modified by carbodiimide activation \nvia\n O-acylisourea formation followed by subsequent derivitization, for example, to a corresponding amide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSulphydryl groups may be modified by methods such as carboxymethylation with iodoacetic acid or iodoacetamide; performic acid oxidation to cysteic acid; formation of a mixed disulphides with other thiol compounds; reaction with maleimide, maleic anhydride or other substituted maleimide; formation of mercurial derivatives using 4-chloromercuribenzoate, 4-chloromercuriphenylsulphonic acid, phenylmercury chloride, 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol and other mercurials; carbamoylation with cyanate at alkaline pH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTryptophan residues may be modified by, for example, oxidation with N-bromosuccinimide or alkylation of the indole ring with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide or sulphenyl halides. Tyrosine residues on the other hand, may be altered by nitration with tetranitromethane to form a 3-nitrotyrosine derivative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModification of the imidazole ring of a histidine residue may be accomplished by alkylation with iodoacetic acid derivatives or N-carbethoxylation with diethylpyrocarbonate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of incorporating unnatural amino acids and derivatives during peptide synthesis include, but are not limited to, use of norleucine, 4-amino butyric acid, 4-amino-3-hydroxy-5-phenylpentanoic acid, 6-aminohexanoic acid, t-butylglycine, norvaline, phenylglycine, ornithine, sarcosine, 4-amino-3-hydroxy-6-methylheptanoic acid, 2-thienyl alanine and/or D-isomers of amino acids.

used, for example, to stabilize 3D conformations, using homo- bifunctional crosslinkers such as the bifunctional imido esters having (CH\n2\n)\nn\n spacer groups with n=1 to n=6, glutaraldehyde, N-hydroxysuccinimide esters and hetero-bifunctional reagents which usually contain an amino-reactive moiety such as N-hydroxysuccinimide and another group specific-reactive moiety such as maleimido or dithio moiety (SH) or carbodiimide (COOH). In addition, peptides can be conformationally constrained by, for example, incorporation of C\nα\n and N \nα\n-methylamino acids, introduction of double bonds between C\nα\n and C\nβ\n atoms of amino acids and the formation of cyclic peptides or analogs by introducing covalent bonds such as forming an amide bond between the N and C termini, between two side chains or between a side chain and the N or C terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present description contemplates any compound which binds or otherwise interacts with a TLR, such as TLR-2 or TLR-4, or a component of a TLR signaling pathway resulting in potentiation, activation or up-regulation or antagonism or down-regulation of the TLR or TLR signaling pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother useful group of compounds disclosed herein is a mimetic. The terms \"peptide mimetic\", \"target mimetic\" or \"mimetic\" are intended to refer to a substance which has some chemical similarity to the target but which antagonizes or agonizes or mimics the target. The target in this case may be a TLR ligand. A peptide mimetic may be a peptide-containing molecule that mimics elements of protein secondary structure (\nJohnson et al., \"\nPeptide Turn Mimetics\n\" in Biotechnology and Pharmacy, Pezzuto et al., Eds., Chapman and Hall, New York, 1993\n). The underlying rationale behind the use of peptide mimetics is that the peptide backbone of proteins exists chiefly to orient amino acid side chains in such a way as to facilitate molecular interactions such as those of antibody and antigen, enzyme and substrate or scaffolding proteins. A peptide mimetic is designed to permit molecular interactions similar to the natural molecule. Peptide or non-peptide mimetics may be useful, for example, to activate a TLR or TLR pathway or to competitively inhibit a TLR. Preferred TLRs in this instance are TLR-2 and TLR-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgain, the compounds disclosed herein may be selected to interact with a target alone or single or multiple compounds may be used to affect multiple targets. For example, multiple targets may include a TLR and the microorganism or virus itself.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe target TLR or fragment employed in screening assays may either be free in solution, affixed to a solid support, or borne on a cell surface. One method of drug screening utilizes eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells which are stably transformed with recombinant polynucleotides expressing the TLR or fragment, preferably in competitive binding assays. Such cells, either in viable or fixed form, can be used for standard binding assays. One may measure, for example, the formation of complexes between a TLR or fragment and the agent being tested, or examine the degree to which the formation of a complex between a TLR or fragment and a ligand is aided or interfered with by the agent being tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA substance identified as a modulator of target function or gene activity may be a peptide or non-peptide in nature. Non-peptide \"small molecules\" are often preferred for many \nin vivo\n pharmaceutical uses. Accordingly, a mimetic or mimic of the substance (particularly if a peptide) may be designed for pharmaceutical use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe designing of mimetics to a pharmaceutically active compound is a known approach to the development of pharmaceuticals based on a \"lead\" compound. This might be desirable where the active compound is difficult or expensive to synthesize or where it is unsuitable for a particular method of administration, e.g. peptides are unsuitable active agents for oral compositions as they tend to he quickly degraded by proteases in the alimentary canal. Mimetic design, synthesis and testing is generally used to avoid randomly screening large numbers of molecules for a target property.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are several steps commonly taken in the design of a mimetic from a compound having a given target property. First, the particular parts of the compound that are critical and/or important in determining the target property are determined. In the case of a peptide, this can be done by systematically varying the amino acid residues in the peptide, e.g. by substituting each residue in turn. Alanine scans of peptides are commonly used to refine such peptide motifs. These parts or residues constituting the active region of the compound are known as its \"pharmacophore\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the pharmacophore has been found, its structure is modeled according to its physical properties, e.g. stereochemistry, bonding, size and/or charge, using data from a range of sources, e.g. spectroscopic techniques, x-ray diffraction data and NMR. Computational analysis, similarity mapping (which models the charge and/or volume of a pharmacophore, rather than the bonding between atoms) and other techniques can be used in this modeling process.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a variant of this approach, the three-dimensional structure of a TLR and its ligand are modeled. This can be especially useful where the TLR and/or its ligand change conformation on binding, allowing the model to take account of this in the design of the mimetic. Modeling can be used to generate inhibitors which interact with the linear sequence or a three-dimensional configuration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA template molecule is then selected onto which chemical groups which mimic the pharmacophore can be grafted. The template molecule and the chemical groups grafted onto it can conveniently be selected so that the mimetic is easy to synthesize, is likely to be pharmacologically acceptable, and does not degrade \nin vivo,\n while retaining the biological activity of the lead compound. Alternatively, where the mimetic is peptide-based, further stability can be achieved by cyclizing the peptide, increasing its rigidity. The mimetic or mimetics found by this approach can then be screened to see whether they have the target property, or to what extent they exhibit it. Further optimization or modification can then be carried out to arrive at one or more final mimetics for \nin vivo\n or clinical testing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe goal of rational drug design is to produce structural analogs of biologically active polypeptides of interest or of small molecules with which they interact (e.g. agonists, antagonists, inhibitors or enhancers) in order to fashion drugs which are, for example, more active or stable forms of the polypeptide, or which, e.g. enhance or interfere with the function of a polypeptide \nin vivo.\n See, e.g. \nHodgson (Bio/Technology 9: 19-21, 1991\n). In one approach, one first determines the three-dimensional structure of a TLR ligand by x-ray crystallography, by computer modeling or most typically, by a combination of approaches. Useful information regarding the structure of a TLR ligand may also be gained by modeling based on the structure of homologous proteins. An example of rational drug design is the development of HIV protease inhibitors (\nErickson et al., Science 249: 527-533, 1990\n). In addition, target molecules may be analyzed by an alanine scan (\nWells, Methods Enzymol. 202: 2699-2705, 1991\n). In this technique, an amino acid residue is replaced by Ala and its effect on the peptide's activity is determined. Each of the amino acid residues of the peptide is analyzed in this manner to determine the important regions of the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProteomics may be also be used to screen for the differential production of components of the TLR signaling pathway or of particular TLRs such as TLR-2 and TLR-4 in response to different physiological conditions and/or in the presence of candidate drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also possible to isolate a TLR-specific or TLR ligand-specific antibody (such as by the method described above) and then to solve its crystal structure. In principle, this approach yields a pharmacophore upon which subsequent drug design can be based. It is possible to bypass protein crystallography altogether by generating anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-ids) to a functional, pharmacologically active antibody. As a mirror image of a mirror image, the binding site of the anti-ids would be expected to be an analog of the original receptor. The anti-id could then be used to identify and isolate peptides from banks of chemically or biologically produced banks of peptides. Selected peptides would then act as the pharmacophore.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present description and methods and use of the invention extends to a genetic approach to up-regulating or down-regulating expression of a gene encoding a TLR, such as TLR-2 or TLR-4, or up- or down-regulating a compound in the TLR signaling pathway. Generally, it is more convenient to use genetic means to induce gene silencing such as pre- or post-transcriptional gene silencing. However, the general techniques can be used to up-regulate expression such as by increasing gene copy numbers or antagonizing inhibitors of gene expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"nucleic acids\", \"nucleotide\" and \"polynucleotide\" include RNA, cDNA, genomic DNA, synthetic forms and mixed polymers, both sense and antisense strands, and may be chemically or biochemically modified or may contain non-natural or derivatized nucleotide bases, as will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. Such modifications include, for example, labels, methylation, substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog (such as the morpholine ring), internucleotide modifications such as uncharged linkages (e.g. methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.), charged linkages (e.g. phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), pendent moieties (e.g. polypeptides), intercalators (e.g. acridine, psoralen, etc.), chelators, alkylators and modified linkages (e.g. α-anomeric nucleic acids, etc.). Also included are synthetic molecules that mimic polynucleotides in their ability to bind to a designated sequence \nvia\n hydrogen binding and other chemical interactions. Such molecules are known in the art and include, for example, those in which peptide linkages substitute for phosphate linkages in the backbone of the molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntisense polynucleotide sequences, for example, are useful in silencing transcripts of TLR genes, such as TLR-2 or TLR-4 gene transcripts. Expression of such an antisense construct within a cell interferes with TLR gene transcription and/or translation. Furthermore, co-suppression and mechanisms to induce RNAi or siRNA may also be employed. Alternatively, antisense or sense molecules may be directly administered. In this latter embodiment, the antisense or sense molecules may be formulated in a composition and then administered by any number of means to target cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variation on antisense and sense molecules involves the use of morpholinos, which are oligonucleotides composed of morpholine nucleotide derivatives and phosphorodiamidate linkages (for example, \nSummerton and Weller, Antisense and Nucleic Acid Drug Development 7: 187-195, 1997\n). Such compounds are injected into embryos and the effect of interference with mRNA is observed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present description discloses compounds such as oligonucleotides and similar species for use in modulating the function or effect of nucleic acid molecules such as those encoding a TLR, such as TLR-2 or TLR-4, i.e. the oligonucleotides induce pre-transcriptional or post-transcriptional gene silencing. This is accomplished by providing oligonucleotides which specifically hybridize with one or more nucleic acid molecules encoding the TLR gene transcription. The oligonucleotides may be provided directly to a cell or generated within the cell. As used herein, the terms \"target nucleic acid\" and \"nucleic acid molecule encoding a TLR gene transcript\" have been used for convenience to encompass DNA encoding the TLR, RNA (including pre-mRNA and mRNA or portions thereof) transcribed from such DNA, and also cDNA derived from such RNA. The hybridization of a compound of the subject invention with its target nucleic acid is generally referred to as \"antisense\". Consequently, the preferred mechanism believed to be included in the practice of some preferred embodiments of the invention is referred to herein as \"antisense inhibition.\" Such antisense inhibition is typically based upon hydrogen bonding-based hybridization of oligonucleotide strands or segments such that at least one strand or segment is cleaved, degraded, or otherwise rendered inoperable. In this regard, it is presently preferred to target specific nucleic acid molecules and their functions for such antisense inhibition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe functions of DNA to be interfered with can include replication and transcription. Replication and transcription, for example, can be from an endogenous cellular template, a vector, a plasmid construct or otherwise. The functions of RNA to be interfered with can include functions such as translocation of the RNA to a site of protein translation, translocation of the RNA to sites within the cell which are distant from the site of RNA synthesis, translation of protein from the RNA, splicing of the RNA to yield one or more RNA species, and catalytic activity or complex formation involving the RNA which may be engaged in or facilitated by the RNA. In one example, the result of such interference with TLR transcript function is reduced levels of the TLR. As referred to herein \"modulation\" and \"modulation of expression\" mean either an increase (stimulation) or a decrease (inhibition) in the amount or levels of a nucleic acid molecule encoding the gene, e.g., DNA or RNA. Inhibition is often the preferred form of modulation of expression and mRNA is often a preferred target nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"hybridization\" means the pairing of complementary strands of oligomeric compounds. In the present invention, the preferred mechanism of pairing involves hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary nucleoside or nucleotide bases (nucleobases) of the strands of oligomeric compounds. For example, adenine and thymine are complementary nucleobases which pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. Hybridization can occur under varying circumstances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antisense compound is specifically hybridizable when binding of the compound to the target nucleic acid interferes with the normal function of the target nucleic acid to cause a loss of activity, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the antisense compound to non-target nucleic acid sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e. under physiological conditions in the case of \nin vivo\n assays or therapeutic treatment, and under conditions in which assays are performed in the case of \nin vitro\n assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Complementary\" as used herein, refers to the capacity for precise pairing between two nucleobases of an oligomeric compound. For example, if a nucleobase at a certain position of an oligonucleotide (an oligomeric compound), is capable of hydrogen bonding with a nucleobase at a certain position of a target nucleic acid, said target nucleic acid being a DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotide molecule, then the position of hydrogen bonding between the oligonucleotide and the target nucleic acid is considered to be a complementary position. The oligonucleotide and the further DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotide molecule are complementary to each other when a sufficient number of complementary positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleobases which can hydrogen bond with each other. Thus, \"specifically hybridizable\" and \"complementary\" are terms which are used to indicate a sufficient degree of precise pairing or complementarity over a sufficient number of nucleobases such that stable and specific binding occurs between the oligonucleotide and a target nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the present description, compounds include antisense oligomeric compounds, antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides, alternate splicers, primers, probes, and other oligomeric compounds which hybridize to at least a portion of the target nucleic acid. As such, these compounds may be introduced in the form of single-stranded, double-stranded, circular or hairpin oligomeric compounds and may contain structural elements such as internal or terminal bulges or loops. Once introduced to a system, the compounds may elicit the action of one or more enzymes or structural proteins to effect modification of the target nucleic acid. One non-limiting example of such an enzyme is RNAse H, a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex. It is known in the art that single-stranded antisense compounds which are \"DNA-like\" elicit RNAse H. Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of gene expression. Similar roles have been postulated for other ribonucleases such as those in the RNase III and ribonuclease L family of enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the preferred form of antisense compound is a single-stranded antisense oligonucleotide, in many species the introduction of double-stranded structures, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, has been shown to induce potent and specific antisense-mediated reduction of the function of a gene or its associated gene products. This phenomenon occurs in both plants and animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"oligomeric compound\" refers to a polymer or oligomer comprising a plurality of monomeric units. As used herein, the term \"oligonucleotide\" refers to an oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or mimetics, chimeras, analogs and homologs thereof. This term includes oligonucleotides composed of naturally occurring nucleobases, sugars and covalent internucleoside (backbone) linkages as well as oligonucleotides having non-naturally occurring portions which function similarly. Such modified or substituted oligonucleotides are often preferred over native forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for a target nucleic acid and increased stability in the presence of nucleases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile oligonucleotides are a preferred form of the compounds (agents) for use according to this invention, the present invention comprehends other families of compounds as well, including but not limited to oligonucleotide analogs and mimetics such as those herein described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe open reading frame (ORF) or \"coding region\" which is known in the art to refer to the region between the translation initiation codon and the translation termination codon, is a region which may be effectively targeted. Within the context of the present invention, one region is the intragenic region encompassing the translation initiation or termination codon of the open reading frame (ORF) of a gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther target regions include the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 5' direction from the translation initiation codon, and thus including nucleotides between the 5' cap site and the translation initiation codon of an mRNA (or corresponding nucleotides on the gene), and the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 3' direction from the translation termination codon, and thus including nucleotides between the translation termination codon and 3' end of an mRNA (or corresponding nucleotides on the gene). The 5' cap site of an mRNA comprises an N7-methylated guanosine residue joined to the 5'-most residue of the mRNA \nvia\n a 5'-5' triphosphate linkage. The 5' cap region of an mRNA is considered to include the 5' cap structure itself as well as the first 50 nucleotides adjacent to the cap site. It is also preferred to target the 5' cap region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough some eukaryotic mRNA transcripts are directly translated, many contain one or more regions, known as \"introns\", which are excised from a transcript before it is translated. The remaining (and, therefore, translated) regions are known as \"exons\" and are spliced together to form a continuous mRNA sequence. Targeting splice sites, i.e. intron-exon junctions or exon-intron junctions, may also be particularly useful in situations where aberrant splicing is implicated in disease, or where an overproduction of a particular splice product is implicated in disease. Aberrant fusion junctions due to rearrangements or deletions are also preferred target sites. mRNA transcripts produced \nvia\n the process of splicing of two (or more) mRNAs from different gene sources are known as \"fusion transcripts\". It is also known that introns can be effectively targeted using antisense compounds targeted to, for example, DNA or pre-mRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is known in the art, a nucleoside is a base-sugar combination. The base portion of the nucleoside is normally a heterocyclic base. The two most common classes of such heterocyclic bases are the purines and the pyrimidines. Nucleotides are nucleosides that further include a phosphate group covalently linked to the sugar portion of the nucleoside. For those nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to either the 2', 3' or 5' hydroxyl moiety of the sugar. In forming oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups covalently link adjacent nucleosides to one another to form a linear polymeric compound. In turn, the respective ends of this linear polymeric compound can be further joined to form a circular compound, however, linear compounds are generally preferred. In addition, linear compounds may have internal nucleobase complementarity and may, therefore, fold in a manner as to produce a fully or partially double-stranded compound. Within oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups are commonly referred to as forming the internucleoside backbone of the oligonucleotide. The normal linkage or backbone of RNA and DNA is a 3' to 5' phosphodiester linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific examples of preferred antisense compounds useful in this invention include oligonucleotides containing modified backbones or non-natural internucleoside linkages. As defined in this specification, oligonucleotides having modified backbones include those that retain a phosphorus atom in the backbone and those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the backbone. For the purposes of this specification, and as sometimes referenced in the art, modified oligonucleotides that do not have a phosphorus atom in their internucleoside backbone can also be considered to be oligonucleosides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred modified oligonucleotide backbones containing a phosphorus atom therein include, for example, phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3'-alkylene phosphonates, 5'-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates including 3'-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, selenophosphates and boranophosphates having normal 3'-5' linkages, 2'-5' linked analogs of these, and those having inverted polarity wherein one or more internucleotide linkages is a 3' to 3', 5' to 5' or 2' to 2' linkage. Preferred oligonucleotides having inverted polarity comprise a single 3' to 3' linkage at the 3'-most internucleotide linkage i.e. a single inverted nucleoside residue which may be abasic (the nucleobase is missing or has a hydroxyl group in place thereof). Various salts, mixed salts and free acid forms are also included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antisense oligonucleotides may be administered by any convenient means including by inhalation, local or systemic means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, genetic constructs including DNA vaccines may be used to generate antisense molecules \nin vivo.\n Furthermore, many of the preferred features described above are appropriate for sense nucleic acid molecules or for gene therapy applications to promote levels of TLRs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing identification of an agent which potentiates or antagonizes a TLR or TLR pathway, it may be manufactured and/or used in a preparation, i.e. in the manufacture or formulation or a composition such as a medicament, pharmaceutical composition or drug. These may be administered to individuals in a method of treatment or prophylaxis of inection. Alternatively, they may be incorporated into a patch or slow release capsule or implant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso disclosed herein is a pharmaceutical composition, medicament, drug or other composition including a patch or slow release formulation comprising an agonist or antagonist of TLR activity or TLR gene expression or the activity or gene expression of a component of the TLR signaling pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present description contemplates a method comprising administration of such a composition to a subject such as for treatment or prophylaxis of an infection. Furthermore, the present description contemplates a method of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing a compound of the instant invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, vehicle or carrier, and optionally other ingredients. Where multiple compositions are provided, then such compositions may be given simultaneously or sequentially. Sequential administration includes administration within nanoseconds, seconds, minutes, hours or days. Preferably, sequential administration is within seconds or minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMulti-part including two-part pharmaceutical compositions or packs are also disclosed comprising multiple components such as those which potentiate or inhibit a TLR such as TLR-2 or TLR-4 together with anti-microbial or anti-viral agents. Such multi-part pharmaceutical compositions or packs maintain different agents or groups of agents separately. These are either dispensed separately or admixed prior to being dispensed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present description discloses a method for the treatment or prophylaxis of an infection in a subject, said method comprising administering to said subject an effective amount of a compound as described herein or a composition comprising same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus in a further aspect, the present invention provides an agent which up-regulates or down-regulates the level of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 for use in treating a subject infected with HCV or HBV wherein the agent down-regulates TLR-2 and TLR-4 in anti-HCV treatment and up-regulates TLR-2 in anti-HBV treatment, wherein said agent is selected from an antibody specific for TLR-2 or TLR-4 or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, a sense or antisense nucleic acid molecule to TLR-2 or TLR-4 and RNAi, siRNA, a ribozyme or a DNAzyme to TLR-2 or TLR-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the subject is a mammal such as a human or laboratory test animal such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig, hamster, zebrafish or amphibian or avian species such as a duck.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis disclosed method also includes providing a wild-type or mutant target gene function to a cell. This is particularly useful when generating an animal model. Alternatively, it may be part of a gene therapy approach. A target gene or a part of the gene may be introduced into the cell in a vector such that the gene remains extrachromosomal. In such a situation, the gene will be expressed by the cell from the extrachromosomal location. If a gene portion is introduced and expressed in a cell carrying a mutant target allele, the gene portion should encode a part of the target protein. Vectors for introduction of genes both for recombination and for extrachromosomal maintenance are known in the art and any suitable vector may be used. Methods for introducing DNA into cells such as electroporation calcium phosphate co-precipitation and viral transduction are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene transfer systems known in the art may be useful in the practice of genetic manipulation. These include viral and non-viral transfer methods. A number of viruses have been used as gene transfer vectors or as the basis for preparing gene transfer vectors, including papovaviruses (e.g. SV40, \nMadzak et al., J. Gen. Virol. 73: 1533-1536, 1992\n), adenovirus (\nBerkner, Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 158: 39-66, 1992\n; \nBerkner et al., \n; \nGorziglia and Kapikian, J.

Virol. 66: 2731-2739, 1982\n] origin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-viral gene transfer methods are known in the art such as chemical techniques including calcium phosphate co-precipitation, mechanical techniques, for example, microinjection, membrane fusion-mediated transfer \nvia\n liposomes and direct DNA uptake and receptor-mediated DNA transfer. Viral-mediated gene transfer can be combined with direct \nin vivo\n gene transfer using liposome delivery, allowing one to direct the viralvectors to particular cells. Alternatively, the retroviral vector producer cell line can be injected into particular tissue. Injection of producer cells would then provide a continuous source of vector particles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an approach which combines biological and physical gene transfer methods, plasmid DNA of any size is combined with a polylysine-conjugated antibody specific to the adenovirus hexon protein and the resulting complex is bound to an adenovirus vector. The trimolecular complex is then used to infect cells. The adenovirus vector permits efficient binding, internalization and degradation of the endosome before the coupled DNA is damaged. For other techniques for the delivery of adenovirus based vectors, see \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,691,198\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposome/DNA complexes have been shown to be capable of mediating direct \nin vivo\n gene transfer. While in standard liposome preparations the gene transfer process is non-specific, localized \nin vivo\n uptake and expression have been reported in tumor deposits, for example, following direct \nin situ\n administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the polynucleotide encodes a sense or antisense polynucleotide or a ribozyme or DNAzyme, expression will produce the sense or antisense polynucleotide or ribozyme or DNAzyme. Thus, in this context, expression does not require that a protein product be synthesized. In addition to the polynucleotide cloned into the expression vector, the vector also contains a promoter functional in eukaryotic cells. The cloned polynucleotide sequence is under control of this promoter. Suitable eukaryotic promoters include those described above. The expression vector may also include sequences, such as selectable markers and other sequences described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells which carry mutant target alleles (e.g. TLR-2 or TLR-4) or where one or both alleles are deleted or up-regulated can be used as model systems to study the effects of infection or other disease condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds, agents, medicaments, nucleic acid molecules and other target antagonists or agonists disclosed herein can be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions which are prepared according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. See, for example, \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. (1990, Mack Publishing, Company, Easton, PA, U.S.A\n.). The composition may contain the active agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the active agent. These compositions may comprise, in addition to one of the active substances, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, buffer, stabilizer or other materials well known in the art. Such materials should be nontoxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g. topical, intravenous, oral, intrathecal, epineural or parenteral.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor oral administration, the compounds can be formulated into solid or liquid preparations such as capsules, pills, tablets, lozenges, powders, suspensions or emulsions. In preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, suspending agents, and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations (such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions); or carriers such as starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations (such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets). Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar-coated or enteric-coated by standard techniques. The active agent can be encapsulated to make it stable to passage through the gastrointestinal tract while at the same time allowing for passage across the blood brain barrier. See for example, International Patent Publication No. \n \nWO 96/11698\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor parenteral administration, the compound may be dissolved in a pharmaceutical carrier and administered as either a solution of a suspension. Illustrative of suitable carriers are water, saline, dextrose solutions, fructose solutions, ethanol, or oils of animal, vegetative or synthetic origin. The carrier may also contain other ingredients, for example, preservatives, suspending agents, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like. When the compounds are being administered intrathecally, they may also be dissolved in cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active agent is preferably administered in a therapeutically effective amount. The actual amount administered and the rate and time-course of administration will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated. Prescription of treatment, e.g. decisions on dosage, timing, etc. is within the responsibility of general practitioners or specialists and typically takes account of the disorder to be treated, the condition of the individual patient, the site of delivery, the method of administration and other factors known to practitioners. Examples of techniques and protocols can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \nsupra\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, targeting therapies may be used to deliver the active agent more specifically to certain types of cell, by the use of targeting systems such as antibodies or cell specific ligands or specific nucleic acid molecules. Targeting may be desirable for a variety of reasons, e.g. if the agent is unacceptably toxic or if it would otherwise require too high a dosage or if it would not otherwise be able to enter the target cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInstead of administering these agents directly, they could be produced in the target cell, e.g. in a viral vector such as described above or in a cell based delivery system such as described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,550,050\n \n and International Patent Publication Nos. \n \nWO 92/19195\n \n, \n \nWO 94/25503\n \n, \n \nWO 95/01203\n \n, \n \nWO 95/05452\n \n, \n \nWO 96/02286\n \n, \n \nWO 96/02646\n \n, \n \nWO 96/40871\n \n, \n \nWO 96/40959\n \n and \n \nWO 97/12635\n \n. The vector could be targeted to the target cells. The cell based delivery system is designed to be implanted in a patient's body at the desired target site and contains a coding sequence for the target agent. Alternatively, the agent could be administered in a precursor form for conversion to the active form by an activating agent produced in, or targeted to, the cells to be treated. See, for example, European Patent Application No. \n \n0 425 731 A\n \n and International Patent Publication No. \n \nWO 90/07936\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides \nin vitro\n diagnostic methods such as to determine whether a subject will respond to an anti-HCV treatment or an anti-HBV treatment, for monitoring a response to treatment of a subject against HCV or HBV infection and for predicting the outcome of a therapeutic protocol directed against infection by HCV or HBV. These methods comprise determining the level of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunological based TLR detection protocols may take a variety of forms. For example, a plurality of antibodies may be immobilized in an array each with different specificities to particular TLRs or monocytes or hepatocytes comprising TLRs. Cells from a biopsy are then brought into contact with the antibody array and a diagnosis may be made as to the level and type of TLRs elevated or down-regulated on the cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther more conventional assays may also be conducted such as by ELISA, Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation analysis, immunofluorescence analysis, immunochemistry analysis or FACS analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present description discloses a method of detecting a TLR or cell comprising same or fragment, variant or derivative thereof comprising contacting the sample with an antibody or fragment or derivative thereof and detecting the level of a complex comprising said antibody and the TLR or fragment, variant or derivative thereof compared to normal controls wherein altered levels of the TLR is indicative of the presence or absence of infection or other disease condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the TLR is TLR-2 and/or TLR-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed above, any suitable technique for determining formation of the complex may be used. For example, an antibody as disclosed herein, having a reporter molecule associated therewith, may be utilized in immunoassays. Such immunoassays include but are not limited to radioimmunoassays (RIAs), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), immunochromatographic techniques (ICTs) and Western blotting which are well known to those of skill in the art. For example, reference may be made to Coligan \net al\n., 1991-1997, \nsupra\n which discloses a variety of immunoassays which may be used in methods disclosed herein. Immunoassays may include competitive assays. It will be understood that the present invention encompasses qualitative and quantitative immunoassays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable immunoassay techniques are described, for example, in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 4,016,043\n \n, \n \n4,424,279 \n \nand \n \n4,018,653\n \n. These include both single-site and two-site assays of the non-competitive types, as well as the traditional competitive binding assays. These assays also include direct binding of a labeled antigen-binding molecule to a target antigen. The antigen in this case is the TLR or a fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo-site assays are particularly favoured for use in the methods disclosed herein. A number of variations of these assays exist, all of which are intended to be encompassed by the present invention. Briefly, in a typical forward assay, an unlabeled antigen-binding molecule such as an unlabeled antibody is immobilized on a solid substrate and the sample to be tested brought into contact with the bound molecule. After a suitable period of incubation, for a period of time sufficient to allow formation of an antibody-antigen complex, another antigen-binding molecule, suitably a second antibody specific to the antigen, labeled with a reporter molecule capable of producing a detectable signal is then added and incubated, allowing time sufficient for the formation of another complex of antibody-antigen-labeled antibody. Any unreacted material is washed away and the presence of the antigen is determined by observation of a signal produced by the reporter molecule. The results may be either qualitative, by simple observation of the visible signal, or may be quantitated by comparing with a control sample containing known amounts of antigen. Variations on the forward assay include a simultaneous assay, in which both sample and labeled antibody are added simultaneously to the bound antibody. These techniques are well known to those skilled in the art, including minor variations as will be readily apparent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the typical forward assay, a first antibody having specificity for the antigen or antigenic parts thereof is either covalently or passively bound to a solid surface. The solid surface is typically glass or a polymer, the most commonly used polymers being cellulose, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene. The solid supports may be in the form of tubes, beads, discs of microplates, or any other surface suitable for conducting an immunoassay. The binding processes are well known in the art and generally consist of cross-linking covalently binding or physically adsorbing, the polymer-antibody complex is washed in preparation for the test sample. An aliquot of the sample to be tested is then added to the solid phase complex and incubated for a period of time sufficient and under suitable conditions to allow binding of any antigen present to the antibody. Following the incubation period, the antigen-antibody complex is washed and dried and incubated with a second antibody specific for a portion of the antigen. The second antibody has generally a reporter molecule associated therewith that is used to indicate the binding of the second antibody to the antigen. The amount of labeled antibody that binds, as determined by the associated reporter molecule, is proportional to the amount of antigen bound to the immobilized first antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn alternative method involves immobilizing the antigen in the biological sample and then exposing the immobilized antigen to specific antibody that may or may not be labeled with a reporter molecule. Depending on the amount of target and the strength of the reporter molecule signal, a bound antigen may be detectable by direct labelling with the antibody. Alternatively, a second labeled antibody, specific to the first antibody is exposed to the target-first antibody complex to form a target-first antibody-second antibody tertiary complex. The complex is detected by the signal emitted by the reporter molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the reporter molecule associated with the antigen-binding molecule may include the following:-\n\n \n \n \n(a) direct attachment of the reporter molecule to the antibody;\n \n(b) indirect attachment of the reporter molecule to the antibody; i.e., attachment of the reporter molecule to another assay reagent which subsequently binds to the antibody; and\n \n(c) attachment to a subsequent reaction product of the antibody.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe reporter molecule may be selected from a group including a chromogen, a catalyst, an enzyme, a fluorochrome, a chemiluminescent molecule, a paramagnetic ion, a lanthanide ion such as Europium (Eu\n34\n), a radioisotope including other nuclear tags and a direct visual label.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of a direct visual label, use may be made of a colloidal metallic or non-metallic particle, a dye particle, an enzyme or a substrate, an organic polymer, a latex particle, a liposome, or other vesicle containing a signal producing substance and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA large number of enzymes suitable for use as reporter molecules is disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. U.S. 4,366,241\n \n, \n \nU.S. 4,843,000\n \n, and \n \nU.S. 4,849,338\n \n. Suitable useful enzymes include alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase, luciferase, β-galactosidase, glucose oxidase, lysozyme, malate dehydrogenase and the like. The enzymes may be used alone or in combination with a second enzyme that is in solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable fluorochromes include, but are not limited to, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC), R-Phycoerythrin (RPE), and Texas Red. Other exemplary fluorochromes include those discussed by International Patent Publication No. \n \nWO 93/06121\n \n.

As will be readily recognized, however, a wide variety of different conjugation techniques exist which are readily available to the skilled artisan. The substrates to be used with the specific enzymes are generally chosen for the production of, upon hydrolysis by the corresponding enzyme, a detectable colour change. Examples of suitable enzymes include those described \nsupra\n. It is also possible to employ fluorogenic substrates, which yield a fluorescent product rather than the chromogenic substrates noted above. In all cases, the enzyme-labeled antibody is added to the first antibody-antigen complex, allowed to bind, and then the excess reagent washed away. A solution containing the appropriate substrate is then added to the complex of antibody-antigen-antibody. The substrate will react with the enzyme linked to the second antibody, giving a qualitative visual signal, which may be further quantitated, usually spectrophotometrically, to give an indication of the amount of antigen which was present in the sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternately, fluorescent compounds, such as fluorescein, rhodamine and the lanthanide, europium (EU), may be chemically coupled to antibodies without altering their binding capacity. When activated by illumination with light of a particular wavelength, the fluorochrome-labeled antibody adsorbs the light energy, inducing a state of excitability in the molecule, followed by emission of the light at a characteristic colour visually detectable with a light microscope. The fluorescent-labeled antibody is allowed to bind to the first antibody-antigen complex. After washing off the unbound reagent, the remaining tertiary complex is then exposed to light of an appropriate wavelength. The fluorescence observed indicates the presence of the antigen of interest. Immunofluorometric assays (IFMA) are well established in the art and are particularly useful for the present method. However, other reporter molecules, such as radioisotope, chemiluminescent or bioluminescent molecules may also be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies to a TLR may also be used in ELISA-mediated detection of the TLR. This may be undertaken in any number of ways such as immobilizing anti-TLR antibodies to a solid support and contacting these with PBMCs and/or liver cells. Labeled anti-TLR antibodies are then used to detect immobilized TLR. Alternatively, antibodies to other PBMC or liver cell surface markers are used. This assay may be varied in any number of ways and all variations are encompassed by the present disclosure. This approach enables rapid detection and quantitation of TLR levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies as disclosed herein are also useful in \nin situ\n hybridization analysis such as of biopsy material. Such analysis enables the rapid diagnosis of levels of TLRs such as TLR-2 and TLR-4 according to the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the method for detection comprises detecting the level of expression in a cell of a polynucleotide encoding a TLR. Expression of such a polynucleotide may be determined using any suitable technique. For example, a labeled polynucleotide encoding a TLR may be utilized as a probe in a Northern blot of an RNA extract obtained from the cell. Preferably, a nucleic acid extract from the animal is utilized in concert with oligonucleotide primers corresponding to sense and antisense sequences of a polynucleotide encoding the kinase, or flanking sequences thereof, in a nucleic acid amplification reaction such as RT PCR. A variety of automated solid-phase detection techniques are also appropriate. For example, very large scale immobilized primer arrays (VLSIPS (trademark)) are used for the detection of nucleic acids as, for example, described by \nFodor et al. (Science 251: 767-777, 1991\n) and \nKazal et al. (Nature Medicine 2: 753-759, 1996\n). The above genetic techniques are well known to persons skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, for a TLR encoding RNA transcript, RNA is isolated from a cellular sample suspected of containing TLR RNA, e.g. total RNA isolated from human PBMCs. RNA can be isolated by methods known in the art, e.g. using TRIZOL (trademark) reagent (GIBCO-BRULife Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.). Oligo-dT, or random-sequence oligonucleotides, as well as sequence-specific oligonucleotides can be employed as a primer in a reverse transcriptase reaction to prepare first-strand cDNAs from the isolated RNA. Resultant first-strand cDNAs are then amplified with sequence-specific oligonucleotides in PCR reactions to yield an amplified product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Polymerase chain reaction\" or \"PCR\" refers to a procedure or technique in which amounts of a preselected fragment of nucleic acid, RNA and/or DNA, are amplified as described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,683,195\n \n. Generally, sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or beyond is employed to design oligonucleotide primers. These primers will be identical or similar in sequence to opposite strands of the template to be amplified. PCR can be used to amplify specific RNA sequences and cDNA transcribed from total cellular RNA. See generally \nMullis et al. (Quant. Biol. 51: 263, 1987\n; \nErlich, eds., PCR Technology, Stockton Press, NY, 1989\n). Thus, amplification of specific nucleic acid sequences by PCR relies upon oligonucleotides or \"primers\" having conserved nucleotide sequences wherein the conserved sequences are deduced from alignments of related gene or protein sequences, e.g. a sequence comparison of mammalian TLR genes. For example, one primer is prepared which is predicted to anneal to the antisense strand and another primer prepared which is predicted to anneal to the sense strand of a cDNA molecule which encodes a TLR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo detect the amplified product, the reaction mixture is typically subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis or other convenient separation technique and the relative presence of the TLR specific amplified DNA detected. For example, TLR amplified DNA may be detected using Southern hybridization with a specific oligonucleotide probe or comparing is electrophoretic mobility with DNA standards of known molecular weight. Isolation, purification and characterization of the amplified TLR DNA may be accomplished by excising or eluting the fragment from the gel (for example, see references \nLawn et al:, Nucleic Acids Res. 2: 6103, 1981\n; \nGoeddel et al., Nucleic cids Res. 8: 4057-1980\n), cloning the amplified product into a cloning site of a suitable vector, such as the pCRII vector (Invitrogen), sequencing the cloned insert and comparing the DNA sequence to the known sequence of TLR. The relative amounts of TLR mRNA and cDNA can then be determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReal-time PCR is particularly useful in determining transcriptional levels of PCR genes. Determination of transcriptional activity also includes a measure of potential translational activity based on available mRNA transcripts. Real-time PCR as well as other PCR procedures use a number of chemistries for detection of PCR product including the binding of DNA binding fluorophores, the 5' endonuclease, adjacent liner and hairpin oligoprobes and the self-fluorescing amplicons. These chemistries and real-time PCR in general are discussed, for example, in \nMackay et al., Nucleic Acids Res 30(6): 1292-1305, 2002\n; \nWalker, J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicology 15(3): 121-127, 2001\n; \nLewis et al., J. Pathol. 195: 66-71, 2001\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present description further discloses gene arrays and/or gene chips to screen for the up- or dowri-regulation of mRNA transcripts. This is particularly useful in identifying conditions which result in the up- or down-regulation of TLR gene transcripts. Furthermore, compounds can be readily screened which up- or down-regulate TLR transcripts and in particular TLR-2 and TLR-4 transcripts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is further described by the following non-limiting Examples.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of HCV on TLR-2 and TLR-4 expression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe study group included 16 outpatients attending a specialist Liver Clinic at a university teaching hospital with biopsy proven chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) [Tables 3 and 4]. Thirty-two age- and sex-matched, asymptomatic volunteers with no history of liver disease, alcohol intake <20 g/day and normal liver function tests served as controls. Ethical approval was obtained from the South Eastern Area Health Service Research Ethics Committee, Department of Health, New South Wales, Australia.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBlood Sampling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPeripheral blood was drawn using pyrogen-free needles, syringes and containers (Becton-Dickinson, Singapore). Plasma and serum were separated in a refrigerated centrifuge at 4°C and stored at -70°C in pyrogen-free polyethylene cryotubes (Nunc, Denmark) until analysis within six weeks of collection. Whole blood was used for determination of TLR expression on peripheral blood monocytes.\n\n\n \n\n\n \nSerum TNF-\nα \nAssay\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSerum TNF-α was measured using the Quantikine HS Human TNF-γ Immunoassay (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sensitivity of the assay was 0.5 pg/mL.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFlow Cytometry for Determination of TLR Expression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCell surface staining was performed on whole blood using the following anti-human monoclonal antibodies: anti-TLR-2-fluoroisothiocyanate (FITC) and anti-TLR-4-phycoerythrin (PE) (eBioscience) and anti-CD14-peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP) (Becton Dickinson, USA). Isotype matched non-binding controls were used for comparison. Ten thousand CD14-positive cells were acquired for each sample and dead cells were gated out based on their light scatter properties on FACSCaliber flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, USA). At least two control patients were used for standardization purposes every flow cytometry session. TLR-2 and TLR-4 values were expressed as a ratio of the geometric mean fluorescence of individual study patients to mean control values for that session.\n\n \n \nTABLE 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \nPatient Characterisitics\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPatients\n \n \n \nControls\n \n \n \n \n \nNumber of patients\n \n16\n \n32\n \n \n \nMean Age ± sd\n \n38.89 ± 8.67\n \n35.44 ± 8.11\n \n \n \nSex (M:F)\n \n10:6\n \n20:12\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nTABLE 4\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCharacteristics of the CHC patients\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCharacteristic\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGenotype\n \n1: n-11, 2: n=2, 3: n=3\n \n \n \nIshak histological activity score\n \nMedian: 4 range 2-7\n \n \n \nALT\n \nMedian 109 range 55-350 U/L (N: 15-45 U/L)\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis Example demonstrates that CD14\n+ve\n monocyte expression of TLR-2 and of TLR-4 is significantly up-regulated in CHC patients and that the TLR-2 level correlates significantly with circulating TNF-α ALT levels. These findings indicate that the up-regulation in the immune receptors may be a direct effect of the HCV. In addition cell signaling \nvia\n TLR-2, but not TLR-4, likely contributes to the increased circulating levels of TNF-α and the corresponding increased ALT levels found in CHC. The good correlation between TNF-α and ALT levels may indicate a direct causative mechanism for some of the hepatic destruction in HCV infection.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of HBV infection on TLR-2 expression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEighteen non-cirrhotic patients with chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) and on-going viral replication (HBV DNA >200,000 genomes/mL, n=12 and 200-10,000 genomes/mL, n=6; Cobas Amplicor HBV Monitor (trademark) Test, USA) and 32 healthy control subjects were studied. TLR-2 and TLR-4 expression on CD14\n+ve\n peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's) was measured by flow cytometry using anti-CD14 (Becton Dickinson) and anti-TLR-2 and anti-TLR-4 (eBioscience, USA) monoclonal antibodies. TLR expression was reassessed in five patients in whom HBV DNA fell from >200,000 to <200 genomes/mL following treatment with lamivudine. \nIn vitro\n TLR-2 expression by PBMCs was measured in five control subjects at baseline and following stimulation for 20 h by partially purified recombinant HBV. TLR-2 expression (expressed as a ratio to control results) was significantly reduced in chronic hepatitis B patients with HBV DNA >200,000 genomes/mL (median: 0.63; range: 0.05-1.52) compared with controls (P=0.001) and those with HBV DNA 200-10,000 genomes/mL (median: 0.98; range: 0.94-1.17) (P=0.04). TLR-4 expression did not differ significantly between the three groups. TLR-2 expression normalised in each of the five lamivudine-treated CHB patients in whom HBV DNA became undetectable. \nIn vitro\n expression of TLR-2 fell in a concentration-dependent manner following exposure to recombinant HBV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis Example shows that HBV down-regulates expression of TLR-2 on PBMC's. It is proposed herein that the HBV-induced defect in innate immunity contributes to the development of persistent infection.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn vitro Analysis of HBV and TLR expression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHepatitis B Stimulation of Whole Blood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPeripheral blood was collected into Li-heparin tubes from 6 healthy volunteers. Whole blood was diluted with an equal volume of RPMI supplemented with antibiotics and 5% fetal bovine serum. 1 ml of diluted blood was stimulated with wildtype 1.5 (genotype A) HBV at a ratio of 1, 10 and 50 virus particles to 1 peripheral blood cell. Diluted blood was incubated at 37°C with gentle rotation in tightly capped 5ml polystyrene tubes. After 20 hours, culture supernatants were collected for TNF-alpha ELISA. The remaining cells were stained for flow cytometric analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HBV was prepared from transduction of cells using recombinant HBV/ Baculovirus system as previously described (\nDelaney 4th and Isom; Hepatology; 28:1134-46, 1998\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTNF-alpha ELISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTNF-alpha from whole blood culture supernatants was measured by capture ELISA using TNF-alpha OptEIA set (BD) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Sensitivity was 8pg/ml. The TNF alpha results for all patients in shown in \nFigure 3\n a and b.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFlow Cytometry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCell surface staining was performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes using CD14-PerCP (MφP9; BD), TLR2-FITC (TL2.1; eBioscience) and TLR4-PE (HTA125; eBioscience) antibodies. Appropriate isotype controls were used. Based on their scatter profile, monocytes were gated picking up the lymphocyte tail on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD). A total of 8000 CD14 positive monocytes were acquired for each sample. Data was analysed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). Relative fluorescence intensity was determined by subtracting the geometric mean fluorescence intensity of the unstimulated control from the stimulated sample. The TLR2 and TLR4 results for all 6 patients following stimulation with wild type HBV is shown in \nFigure 3\n (c, d, e, and f)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHBV Baculovirus Infected HepG2 (Hershy)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe HBV was prepared from transduction of cells using recombinant HBV/ Baculovirus system as previously described (\nDelaney 4th and Isom; Hepatology. 1998\n, \nsupra\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHepG2 (Hershy) cells were transdued with HBV 1:3 wildtype, or mock baculovirus infected and grown for 7 days prior to harvesting and staining for flow cytometry.\n\nSome cells were reserved for total RNA extraction using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following the Manufacturer's specifications.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFlow Cytometry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCell surface staining was performed on HepG2 cells using TLR2-FITC (TL2.1; eBioscience) and TLR4-PE (HTA125; eBioscience) antibodies. Appropriate isotype controls were used. Dead cells were gated out based on their scatter profile, on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD). A total of 10000 cells were acquired for each sample. Data was analysed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). Relative fluorescence intensity was determined by subtracting the geometric mean fluorescence intensity of the mock infected cells from the wildtype infected cells (\nFigure 4\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nQPCR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTotal RNA was reversed transcribed using random hexamers prior to real time PCR analysis of the cDNA. PCR was performed in triplicate using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and Assays-On-Demand Gene Expression Assay probes and primers (Applied Biosystems) in a final 10µl volume. Signal detection was via ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system programmed to 50°C, 2 min; 95°\nC\n 10 min; 40 cycles of 95°C, 15 sec; 60°C, 1 min. The threshold cycle (\nC\n \nT\n), values of each gene were compared with the \nC\n \nT\n value of 18S (Δ\nC\n \nT\n) and relative expression units (REU) calculated for each sample. Hence, REU= 2^\nC\n \nT\n(gene of interest)-\nC\n \nT\n(18S)= 2^Δ\nC\n \nT\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredicting outcome of therapeutic intervention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing the methods provided in Example 2, subjects potentially exposed to HBV are screened for their levels of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 prior to therapeutic intervention. When a subject exhibits a change in the level of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4 during early phase treatment (i.e. a trend to normalization of levels of TLR-2 and/or TLR-4) then this predicts that the therapy is working. The change in levels may be an elevation or reduction compared to pre-treatment and/or levels of standardized normal controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar diagnostic or predictive process may be applied to subjects potentially exposed or infected with HCV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention described herein is susceptible to variations and modifications other than those specifically described.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Field\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates generally to the field of medicine, and relates specifically to compositions for use in inhibiting angiogenesis of tissues using antagonists of the vitronectin receptor α\nv\nβ\n3\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIntegrins are a class of cellular receptors known to bind extracellular matrix proteins, and therefore mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions, referred generally to as cell adhesion events. However, although many integrins and the ligands that bind an integrin are described in the literature, the biological function of many of the integrins remains elusive. The integrin receptors constitute a family of proteins with shared structural characteristics of noncovalent heterodimeric glycoprotein complexes formed of α and β subunits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe vitronectin receptor, named for its original characteristic of preferential binding to vitronectin, is now known to refer to three different integrins, designated α\nv\nβ\n1\n, α\nv\nβ\n3\n and α\nv\nβ\n5\n. \nHorton, Int. J. Exp. Pathol., 71:741-759 (1990\n). α\nv\nβ\n1\n binds fibronectin and vitronectin. α\nv\nβ\n3\n binds a large variety of ligands, including fibrin, fibrinogen, laminin, thrombospondin, vitronectin, von Willebrand's factor, osteospontin and bone sialoprotein I. α\nv\nβ\n5\n binds vitronectin. The specific cell adhesion roles these three integrins play in the many cellular interactions in tissues are still under investigation, but it is clear that there are different integrins with different biological functions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne important recognition site in the ligand for many integrins is the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) tripeptide sequence. RGD is found in all of the ligands identified above for the vitronectin receptor integrins. This RGD recognition site can be mimicked by polypeptides (\"peptides\") that contain the RGD sequence, and such RGD peptides are known inhibitors of integrin function. It is important to note, however, that depending upon the sequence and structure of the RGD peptide, the specificity of the inhibition can be altered to target specific integrins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor discussions of the RGD recognition site, see \nPierschbacher et al., Nature, 309:30-33 (1984\n), and \nPierschbacher et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 81:5985-5988 (1984\n). Various RGD polypeptides of varying integrin specificity have also been described by \nGrant et al., Cell, 58:933-943 (1989\n), \nCheresh et al., Cell, 58:945-953 (1989\n), \nAumailley et al., FEBS Letts., 291:50-54 (1991\n), and \nPfaff et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269:20233-20238 (1994\n), and in United States Patent Nos. \n \n4,517,686\n \n, \n \n4,578,079\n \n,\n \n 4,589,881\n \n, \n \n4,614,517\n \n, \n \n4,661,111\n \n, \n \n4,792,525\n \n, \n \n4,683,291\n \n,\n \n 4,879,237\n \n, \n \n4,988,621\n \n, \n \n5,041,380\n \n and \n \n5,061,693\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAngiogenesis is a process of tissue vascularization that involves the growth of new developing blood vessels into a tissue, and is also referred to as neo-vascularization. The process is mediated by the infiltration of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. The process is believed to proceed in any one of three ways: the vessels can sprout from pre-existing vessels, de-novo development of vessels can arise from precursor cells (vasculogenesis), or existing small vessels can enlarge in diameter. \nBlood et al., Bioch. Biophys. Acta, 1032:89-118 (1990\n). Vascular endothelial cells are known to contain at least five RGD-dependent integrins, including the vitronectin receptor (α\nv\nβ\n3\n or α\nv\nβ\n5\n), the collagen Types I and IV receptor (α\n1\nβ\n1\n), the laminin receptor (α\n2\nβ\n1\n), the fibronectin/laminin/collagen receptor (α\n3\nβ\n1\n) and the fibronectin receptor (α\n5\nβ\n1\n). \nDavis et al., J. Cell. Biochem., 51:206-218 (1993\n). The smooth muscle cell is known to contain at least six RGD-dependent integrins, including α\n5\nβ\n1\n, α\nv\nβ\n3\n and α\nv\nβ\n5\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAngiogenesis is an important process in neonatal growth, but is also important in wound healing and in the pathogenesis of a large variety of clinical diseases including tissue inflammation, arthritis, tumor growth, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration by neovascularization of retina and the like conditions. These clinical manifestations associated with angiogenesis are referred to as angiogenic diseases. \nFolkman et al., Science, 235:442-447 (1987\n). Angiogenesis is generally absent in adult or mature tissues, although it does occur in wound healing and in the corpeus leuteum growth cycle. See, for example, \nMoses et al., Science, 248:1408-1410 (1990\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been proposed that inhibition of angiogenesis would be a useful therapy for restricting tumor growth. Inhibition of angiogenesis has been proposed by (1) inhibition of release of \"angiogenic molecules\" such as bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor), (2) neutralization of angiogenic molecules, such as by use of anti-βbFGF antibodies, and (3) inhibition of endothelial cell response to angiogenic stimuli. This latter strategy has received attention, and \nFolkman et al., Cancer Biology, 3:89-96 (1992\n), have described several endothelial cell response inhibitors, including collagenase inhibitor, basement membrane turnover inhibitors, angiostatic steroids, fungal-derived angiogenesis inhibitors, \nplatelet factor\n 4, thrombospondin, arthritis drugs such as D-penicillamine and gold thiomalate, vitamin D\n3\n analogs, alpha-interferon, and the like that might be used to inhibit angiogenesis. For additional proposed inhibitors of angiogenesis, see \nBlood et al., Bioch. Biophys. Acta., 1032:89-118 (1990\n), \nMoses et al., Science, 248:1408-1410 (1990\n), \nIngber et al., Lab. Invest., 59:44-51 (1988\n), and United States Patent Nos. \n \n5,092,885\n \n, \n \n5,112,946\n \n, \n \n5,192,744\n \n, and \n \n5,202,352\n \n. None of the inhibitors of angiogenesis described in the foregoing references are targeted at inhibition of α\nv\nβ\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRGD-containing peptides that inhibit vitronectin receptor α\nv\nβ\n3\n have also been described. \nAumailley et al., FEBS Letts., 291:50-54 (1991\n), \nChoi et al., J. Vasc. Surg., 19:125-134 (1994\n), \nSmith et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265:12267-12271 (1990\n), and \nPfaff et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269:20233-20238 (1994\n). However, the role of the integrin α\nv\nβ\n3\n in angiogenesis has never been suggested nor identified until the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, \nHammes et al., Nature Med., 2:529-53 (1996\n) confirmed the findings of the present invention. Specifically, the paper shows that cyclic peptides including cyclic RGDfV, the structure and function of the latter of which has been previously described in the priority applications on which the present application is based, inhibited retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of hypoxia-induced retinal neovascularization. In a separate study that also supports the present invention as well as the priority applications, \nLuna et al., Lab. Invest., 75:563-573 (1996\n) described two particular cyclic methylated RGD-containing peptides that were partially effective at inhibiting retinal neovascularization in the mouse model of oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy. In contrast, the peptides of the present invention exhibit almost complete inhibition of neovascularization in the model systems described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of cell adhesion \nin vitro\n using monoclonal antibodies immunospecific for various integrin α or β subunits have implicated α\nv\nβ\n3\n in cell adhesion of a variety of cell types including microvascular endothelial cells. \nDavis et al., J. Cell. Biol., 51:206-218 (1993\n). In addition, \nNicosia et al., Am. J. Pathol., 138:829-833 (1991\n), described the use of the RGD peptide GRGDS to \nin vitro\n inhibit the formation of \"microvessels\" from rat aorta cultured in collagen gel. However, the inhibition of formation of \"microvessels\" \nin vitro\n in collagen gel cultures is not a model for inhibition of angiogenesis in a tissue because it is not shown that the microvessel structures are the same as capillary sprouts or that the formation of the microvessel in collagen gel culture is the same as neovascular growth into an intact tissue, such as arthritic tissue, tumor tissue or disease tissue where inhibition of angiogenesis is desirable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor angiogenesis to occur, endothelial cells must first degrade and cross the blood vessel basement membrane in a similar manner used by tumor cells during invasion and metastasis formation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventors have previously reported that angiogenesis depends on the interaction between vascular integrins and extracellular matrix proteins. \nBrooks et al., Science, 264:569-571 (1994\n). Furthermore, it was reported that programmed cell death (apoptosis) of angiogenic vascular cells is initiated by the interaction, which would be inhibitied by certain antagonists of the vascular integrin α\nv\nβ\n3\n. \nBrooks et al., Cell, 79:1157-1164 (1994\n). More recently, the inventors have reported that the binding of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) to vitronectin receptor (α\nv\nβ\n5\n) can be inhibited using α\nv\nβ\n5\n antagonists, and thereby inhibit the enzymatic function of the proteinase. \nBrooks et al., Cell, 85:683-693 (1996\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther than the studies reported here, Applicants are unaware of any other demonstration that angiogenesis could be inhibited in a tissue using inhibitors of cell adhesion. In particular, it has never been previously demonstrated by others that α\nv\nβ\n3\n function is required for angiogenesis in a tissue or that α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists can inhibit angiogenesis in a tissue.\n\n\n \n\n\nBrief Description of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention disclosure demonstrates that angiogenesis in tissues requires integrin α\nv\nβ\n3\n, and that inhibitors of α\nv\nβ\n3\n can inhibit angiogenesis. The disclosure also demonstrates that antagonists of other integrins, such as α\nIIb\nβ\n3\n, or α\nv\nβ\n1\n, do not inhibit angiogenesis, presumably because these other integrins are not essential for angiogenesis to occur.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention therefore describes compounds for use in inhibiting α\nv\nβ\n3\n mediated angiogenesis in a tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tissue to be treated can be any tissue in which inhibition of angiogenesis is desirable, such as diseased tissue where neo-vascularization is occurring. Exemplary tissues include inflamed tissue, solid tumors, metastases, tissues undergoing restenosis, and the like tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist for use in the present invention is capable of binding to α\nv\nβ\n3\n and competitively inhibiting the ability of α\nv\nβ\n3\n to bind to a natural ligand. The α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist is an organic mimetic of α\nv\nβ\n3\n as defined in \nclaim\n 1.\n\n\n \n\n\nBrief Description of the Drawings\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the drawings forming a portion of this disclosure:\n\n \n \n \n \nFigures 1A-1D\n illustrate the tissue distribution of the integrin subunits, β\n3\n and β\n1\n, in normal skin and in skin undergoing wound healing designated as granulation tissue.

Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to von Willebrand factor (anti-vWF) and laminin (anti-laminin) was performed as described in Example 3B. \nFigures 2A and 2B\n respectively illustrate the immunoreactivity of anti-vWF in normal skin and granulation tissue. \nFigures 2C and 2D\n respectively illustrate the immunoreactivity of anti-laminin in normal skin and granulation tissue.\n \n \nFigures 3A-3D\n illustrate the tissue distribution of the vitronectin integrin receptor, α\nv\nβ\n3\n, in tissue biopsies of bladder cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer, respectively. Immunohistochemistry with the LM609 antibody against α\nv\nβ\n3\n was performed as described in Example 3C.\n \n \nFigure 4\n illustrates a typical photomicrograph of a CAM of this invention devoid of blood vessels in an untreated 10 day old chick embryo.

As shown in \nFigure 14A\n, tumors treated with control antibody (P3G2) showed numerous viable and actively dividing tumor cells as indicated by mitotic figures (arrowheads) as well as by multiple blood vessels (arrows) throughout the tumor stroma.

This discovery is important because of the role that angiogenesis plays in a variety of disease processes. By inhibiting angiogenesis, one can intervene in the disease, ameliorate the symptoms, and in some cases cure the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the growth of new blood vessels is the cause of, or contributes to, the pathology associated with a disease, inhibition of angiogenesis will reduce the deleterious effects of the disease. Examples include rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, inflammatory diseases, restenosis, and the like. Where the growth of new blood vessels is required to support growth of a deleterious tissue, inhibition of angiogenesis will reduce the blood supply to the tissue and thereby contribute to reduction in tissue mass based on blood supply requirements. Examples include growth of tumors where neovascularization is a continual requirement in order that the tumor grow beyond a few millimeters in thickness, and for the establishment of solid tumor metastases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds for use according to the present invention are effective in part because the therapy is highly selective for angiogenesis and not other biological processes. As shown in the Examples, only new vessel growth contains substantial α\nv\nβ\n3\n, and therefore the therapeutic methods do not adversely effect mature vessels. Furthermore, α\nv\nβ\n3\n is not widely distributed in normal tissues, but rather is found selectively on new vessels, thereby assuring that the therapy can be selectively targeted to new vessel growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to the discoveries of the present invention, it was not known that angiogenesis, and any of the processes dependent on angiogenesis, could be inhibited in vivo by the use of reagents defined in \nclaim\n 1 that antagonize the biological function of α\nv\nβ\n3\n.\n\n\n \nC. \nMethods For Inhibition of Angiogenesis\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides compounds, as defined in \nclaim\n 1, for use in a method for the inhibition of angiogenesis in a tissue, and thereby inhibiting events in the tissue which depend upon angiogenesis. Generally, the compounds are to be administered to the tissue in a composition comprising an angiogenesis-inhibiting amount of said α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described earlier, angiogenesis includes a variety of processes involving neovascularization of a tissue including \"sprouting\", vasculogenesis, or vessel enlargement, all of which angiogenesis processes are mediated by and dependent upon the expression of α\nv\nβ\n3\n. With the exception of traumatic wound healing, corpus leuteum formation and embryogenesis, it is believed that the majority of angiogenesis processes are associated with disease processes and therefore the use of the present therapeutic methods are selective for the disease and do not have deleterious side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are a variety of diseases in which angiogenesis is believed to be important, referred to as angiogenic diseases, including but not limited to, inflammatory disorders such as immune and non-immune inflammation, chronic articular rheumatism and psoriasis, disorders associated with inappropriate or inopportune invasion of vessels such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, restenosis, capillary proliferation in atherosclerotic plaques and osteoporosis, and cancer associated disorders, such as solid tumors, solid tumor metastases, angiofibromas, retrolental fibroplasia, hemangiomas, Kaposi sarcoma and the like cancers which require neovascularization to support tumor growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, methods which inhibit angiogenesis in a diseased tissue ameliorates symptoms of the disease and, depending upon the disease, can contribute to cure of the disease. In one embodiment, the invention contemplates the compounds as defined in \nclaim\n 1 for use in inhibition of angiogenesis, per se, in a tissue. The extent of angiogenesis in a tissue, and therefore the extent of inhibition achieved by the present compounds, can be evaluated by a variety of methods, such as are described in the Examples for detecting α\nv\nβ\n3\n-immunopositive immature and nascent vessel structures by immunohistochemistry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described herein, any of a variety of tissues, or organs comprised of organized tissues, can support angiogenesis in disease conditions including skin, muscle, gut, connective tissue, joints, bones and the like tissue in which blood vessels can invade upon angiogenic stimuli.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in one related embodiment, a tissue to be treated is an inflamed tissue and the angiogenesis to be inhibited is inflamed tissue angiogenesis where there is neovascularization of inflamed tissue. In this class the compounds defined in \nclaim\n 1 are contemplated for use in inhibition of angiogenesis in arthritic tissues, such as in a patient with chronic articular rheumatism, in immune or non-immune inflamed tissues, in psoriatic tissue and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe patient to be treated according to the present invention in its many embodiments is desirably a human patient, although it is to be understood that the principles of the invention indicate that the invention is effective with respect to all mammals, which are intended to be included in the term \"patient\". In this context, a mammal is understood to include any mammalian species in which treatment of diseases associated with angiogenesis is desirable, particularly agricultural and domestic mammalian species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another related embodiment, a tissue to be treated is a retinal tissue of a patient with a retinal disease such as diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration or neovascular glaucoma and the angiogenesis to be inhibited is retinal tissue angiogenesis where there is neovascularization of retinal tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an additional related embodiment, a tissue to be treated is a tumor tissue of a patient with a solid tumor, a metastases, a skin cancer, a breast cancer, a hemangioma or angiofibroma and the like cancer, and the angiogenesis to be inhibited is tumor tissue angiogenesis where there is neovascularization of a tumor tissue. Typical solid tumor tissues treatable by the present methods include lung, pancreas, breast, colon, laryngeal, ovarian, and the like tissues. Exemplary tumor tissue angiogenesis, and inhibition thereof, is described in the Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of tumor tissue angiogenesis is a particularly preferred embodiment because of the important role neovascularization plays in tumor growth. In the absence of neovascularization of tumor tissue, the tumor tissue does not obtain the required nutrients, slows in growth, ceases additional growth, regresses and ultimately becomes necrotic resulting in killing of the tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStated in other words, the present invention provides compounds for use in a method of inhibiting tumor neovascularization by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis according to the present methods. Similarly, the invention provides angiogenesis-inhibiting compounds, for use in inhibiting tumor growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds are also particularly effective against the formation of metastases because (1) their formation requires vascularization of a primary tumor so that the metastatic cancer cells can exit the primary tumor and (2) their establishment in a secondary site requires neovascularization to support growth of the metastases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a related embodiment, the invention contemplates the practice of the compounds for use in the method in conjunction with other therapies such as conventional chemotherapy directed against solid tumors and for control of establishment of metastases. The angiogenesis inhibitor is typically to be administered during or after chemotherapy, although it is preferable to inhibit angiogenesis after a regimen of chemotherapy at times where the tumor tissue will be responding to the toxic assault by inducing angiogenesis to recover by the provision of a blood supply and nutrients to the tumor tissue. In addition, it is preferred that the compounds for use in angiogenesis inhibition are to be administered after surgery where solid tumors have been removed as a prophylaxis against metastases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsofar as the compounds are for use in inhibition of tumor neovascularization, they can also be for use in inhibition of tumor tissue growth, inhibition of tumor metastases formation, and regression of established tumors. The Examples demonstrate regression of an established tumor following a single intravenous administration of an α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist according to this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRestenosis is a process of smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation at the site of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty which hampers the success of angioplasty. The migration and proliferation of SMC's during restenosis can be considered a process of angiogenesis which is inhibited by the present compounds. Therefore, the invention also contemplates compounds for use in inhibition of restenosis by inhibiting angiogenesis in a patient following angioplasty procedures. For inhibition of restenosis, the α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist is typically to be administered after the angioplasty procedure for from about 2 to about 28 days, and more typically for about the first 14 days following the procedure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present compounds for use in inhibiting angiogenesis in a tissue, and therefore also for treatment of angiogenesis-related diseases, are to be administered to a tissue in which angiogenesis is occurring, or is at risk for occurring, whereby the compounds are in a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist capable of inhibiting α\nv\nβ\n3\n binding to its natural ligand. Thus the compounds for use in the method are to be administered to a patient in a therapeutically effective amount of a physiologically tolerable composition containing an α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage ranges for the administration of the α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist depend upon the form of the antagonist, and its potency, as described further herein, and are amounts large enough to produce the desired effect in which angiogenesis and the disease symptoms mediated by angiogenesis are ameliorated. The dosage should not be so large as to cause adverse side effects, such as hyperviscosity syndromes, pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and the like. Generally, the dosage will vary with the age, condition, sex and extent of the disease in the patient and can be determined by one of skill in the art. The dosage can also be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA therapeutically effective amount is an amount of α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist sufficient to produce a measurable inhibition of angiogenesis in the tissue being treated, ie., an angiogenesis-inhibiting amount. Inhibition of angiogenesis can be measured \nin situ\n by immunohistochemistry, as described herein, or by other methods known to one skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsofar as an α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist can take the form of any of five different organic mimetics, as defined in \nclaim\n 1, it is to be appreciated that the potency, and therefore an expression of a \"therapeutically effective\" amount can vary. However, as shown by the present assay methods, one skilled in the art can readily assess the potency of an α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist for use according to this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPotency of an α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist can be measured by a variety of means including inhibition of angiogenesis in the CAM assay, in the \nin vivo\n rabbit eye assay, in the \nin vivo\n chimeric mouse:human assay, and by measuring inhibition of binding of natural ligand to α\nv\nβ\n3\n, all as described herein, and the like assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist has the ability to substantially inhibit binding of a natural ligand such as fibrinogen or vitronectin to α\nv\nβ\n3\n in solution at antagonist concentrations of less than 0.5 micromolar (um), preferably less than 0.1 um, and more preferably less than 0.05 um. By \"substantially\" is meant that at least a 50 percent reduction in binding of fibrinogen is observed by inhibition in the presence of the α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist, and at 50% inhibition is referred to herein as an IC\n50\n value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA more preferred α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist exhibits selectivity for α\nv\nβ\n3\n over other integrins. Thus, a preferred α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist substantially inhibits fibrinogen binding to α\nv\nβ\n3\n but does not substantially inhibit binding of fibrinogen to another integrin, such as α\nv\nβ\n1\n, α\nv\nβ\n5\n or α\nIIb\nβ\n3\n. Particularly preferred is an α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist that exhibits a 10-fold to 100-fold lower IC\n50\n activity at inhibiting fibrinogen binding to α\nv\nβ\n3\n compared to the IC\n50\n activity at inhibiting fibrinogen binding to another integrin. Exemplary assays for measuring IC\n50\n activity at inhibiting fibrinogen binding to an integrin are described in the Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA therapeutically effective amount of an α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist is described as an amount of polypeptide such that when administered in a physiologically tolerable composition is sufficient to achieve a plasma concentration of from about 0.1 microgram (ug) per milliliter (ml) to about 200 ug/ml, preferably from about 1 ug/ml to about 150 ug/ml. Based on a polypeptide having a mass of about 500 grams per mole, the preferred plasma concentration in molarity is from about 2 micromolar (uM) to about 5 millimolar (mM) and preferably about 100 uM to 1 mM polypeptide antagonist. Stated differently, the dosage per body weight can vary from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 300 mg/kg, and preferably from about 0.2 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg, in one or more dose administrations daily, for one or several days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"unit dose\" when used in reference to a therapeutic composition of the present invention refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosage for the subject, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required diluent; i.e., carrier, or vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferred embodiment as shown in the Examples, the α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist is to be administered in a single dosage intravenously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions are to be administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation, and in a therapeutically effective amount. The quantity to be administered and timing depends on the subject to be treated, capacity of the subject's system to utilize the active ingredient, and degree of therapeutic effect desired. Precise amounts of active ingredient required to be administered depend on the judgement of the practitioner and are peculiar to each individual. However, suitable dosage ranges for systemic application are disclosed herein and depend on the route of administration. Suitable regimes for administration are also variable, but are typified by an initial administration followed by repeated doses at one or more hour intervals by a subsequent injection or other administration. Alternatively, continuous intravenous infusion sufficient to maintain concentrations in the blood in the ranges specified for \nin vivo\n therapies are contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated by the present Examples, inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor regression occurs as early as 7 days after the initial contacting with antagonist. Additional or prolonged exposure to antagonist is preferable for 7 days to 6 weeks, preferably about 14 to 28 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a related embodiment, the Examples demonstrate the relationship between inhibition of α\nv\nβ\n3\n and induction of apoptosis in the neovasculature cells bearing α\nv\nβ\n3\n. Thus, compounds for use in methods for inhibition of apoptosis in neovasculature of a tissue are also described. The compounds are used substantially as described herein for inhibition of angiogenesis in all tissues and conditions described therefor. The only noticeable difference is one of timing of effect, which is that apoptosis is manifest quickly, typically about 48 hours after contacting antagonist, whereas inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor regression is manifest more slowly, as described herein. This difference affects the therapeutic regimen in terms of time of administration, and effect desired. Typically, administration for apoptosis of neovasculature can be for 24 hours to about 4 weeks, although 48 hours to 7 days is preferred.\n\n\n \nD. \nTherapeutic Compositions\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention contemplates therapeutic compositions useful for practicing the therapeutic methods described herein. Therapeutic compositions for use according to the present invention contain a physiologically tolerable carrier together with an α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist as described herein, dissolved or dispersed therein as an active ingredient. In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutic α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist composition is not immunogenic when administered to a mammal or human patient for therapeutic purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms \"pharmaceutically acceptable\", \"physiologically tolerable\" and grammatical variations thereof, as they refer to compositions, carriers, diluents and reagents, are used interchangeably and represent that the materials are capable of administration to or upon a mammal without the production of undesirable physiological effects such as nausea, dizziness, gastric upset and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparation of a pharmacological composition that contains active ingredients dissolved or dispersed therein is well understood in the art and need not be limited based on formulation. Typically such compositions are prepared as injectables either as liquid solutions or suspensions, however, solid forms suitable for solution, or suspensions, in liquid prior to use can also be prepared. The preparation can also be emulsified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active ingredient can be mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient and in amounts suitable for use in the therapeutic methods described herein. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol or the like and combinations thereof. In addition, if desired, the composition can contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like which enhance the effectiveness of the active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic composition of the present invention can include pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the components therein. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide) that are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, tartaric, mandelic and the like. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly preferred are the salts of TFA and HCl, when used in the preparation of cyclic polypeptide α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists. Representative salts of peptides are described in the Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhysiologically tolerable carriers are well known in the art. Exemplary of liquid carriers are sterile aqueous solutions that contain no materials in addition to the active ingredients and water, or contain a buffer such as sodium phosphate at physiological pH value, physiological saline or both, such as phosphate-buffered saline. Still further, aqueous carriers can contain more than one buffer salt, as well as salts such as sodium and potassium chlorides, dextrose, polyethylene glycol and other solutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid compositions can also contain liquid phases in addition to and to the exclusion of water. Exemplary of such additional liquid phases are glycerin, vegetable oils such as cottonseed oil, and water-oil emulsions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA therapeutic composition contains an angiogenesis-inhibiting amount of an α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist of the present invention, typically formulated to contain an amount of at least 0.1 weight percent of antagonist per weight of total therapeutic composition. A weight percent is a ratio by weight of inhibitor to total composition. Thus, for example, 0.1 weight percent is 0.1 grams of inhibitor per 100 grams of total composition.\n\n\n \nE. \nAntagonists of Integrin α\n \nv\n \nβ\n \n3\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to certain α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists, designated \"mimetics\", which possess the ability to \"mimic\" a binding domain on the α\nv\nβ\n3\n ligand involved in the functional interaction of the receptor and ligand, and thereby interfere with (i.e., inhibit) normal function, for use in inhibiting α\nv\nβ\n3\n-mediated angiogenesis in a tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA mimetic of this invention is an organic-based molecule and thus is referred to as organic mimetic. The organic mimetic molecules that function as α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists by being a mimetic to a ligand of α\nv\nβ\n3\n are \n \n \n \n \nCompounds\n \n \n \n \n 7, 9, 10, 12 and 14, as described in Example 10.\n\n\n \nF. \nMethods For Assaying Antagonism of α\n \nv\n \nβ\n \n3\n \n\n\n \n \n \nA number of methods are available for assaying antagonism of α\nv\nβ\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe first assay measures inhibition of direct binding of natural ligand to α\nv\nβ\n3\n, and a preferred embodiment is described in detail in the Examples. The assay typically measures the degree of inhibition of binding of a natural ligand, such as fibrinogen, to isolated α\nv\nβ\n3\n in the solid phase by ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe second assay measures angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and is referred to as the CAM assay. The CAM assay has been described in detail by others, and further has been used to measure both angiogenesis and neovascularization of tumor tissues. See \nAusprunk et al., Am. J. Pathol., 79:597-618 (1975\n) and \nOssonski et al., Cancer Res., 40:2300-2309 (1980\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CAM assay is a well recognized assay model for \nin vivo\n angiogenesis because neovascularization of whole tissue is occurring, and actual chick embryo blood vessels are growing into the CAM or into the tissue grown on the CAM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated herein, the CAM assay illustrates inhibition of neovascularization based on both the amount and extent of new vessel growth. Furthermore, it is easy to monitor the growth of any tissue transplanted upon the CAM, such as a tumor tissue. Finally, the assay is particularly useful because there is an internal control for toxicity in the assay system. The chick embryo is exposed to any test reagent, and therefore the health of the embryo is an indication of toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe third assay that measures angiogenesis is the \nin vivo\n rabbit eye model and is referred to as the rabbit eye assay. The rabbit eye assay has been described in detail by others, and further has been used to measure both angiogenesis and neovascularization in the presence of angiogenic inhibitors such as thalidomide. See \nD'Amato, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 91:4082-4085 (1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rabbit eye assay is a well recognized assay model for \nin vivo\n angiogenesis because the neovascularization process, exemplified by rabbit blood vessels growing from the rim of the cornea into the cornea, is easily visualized through the naturally transparent cornea of the eye. Additionally, both the extent and the amount of stimulation or inhibition of neovascularization or regression of neovascularization can easily be monitored over time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, the rabbit is exposed to any test reagent, and therefore the health of the rabbit is an indication of toxicity of the test reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fourth assay measures angiogenesis in the chimeric mouse:human mouse model and is referred to as the chimeric mouse assay. The assay has been described in detail by others, and further has been described herein to measure angiogenesis, neovascularization, and regression of tumor tissues. See \nYan, et al., J. Clin. Invest., 91:986-996 (1993\n). The chimeric mouse assay is a useful assay model for \nin vivo\n angiogenesis because the transplanted skin grafts closely resemble normal human skin histologically and neovascularization of whole tissue is occurring wherein actual human blood vessels are growing from the grafted human skin into the human tumor tissue on the surface of the grafted human skin. The origin of the neovascularization into the human graft can be demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining of the neovasculature with human-specific endothelial cell markers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated herein, the chimeric mouse assay demonstrates regression of neovascularization based on both the amount and extent of regression of new vessel growth. Furthermore, it is easy to monitor effects on the growth of any tissue transplanted upon the grafted skin, such as a tumor tissue. Finally, the assay is useful because there is an internal control for toxicity in the assay system. The chimeric mouse is exposed to any test reagent, and therefore the health of the mouse is an indication of toxicity.\n\n\n \nG. \nArticle of Manufacture\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAlso described is an article of manufacture which is a labelled container for providing an α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist for use according to the invention. An article of manufacture comprises packaging material and a pharmaceutical agent contained within the packaging material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical agent in an article of manufacture is any of the α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists for use according to the present invention, formulated into a pharmaceutically acceptable form as described herein according the the disclosed indications. The article of manufacture contains an amount of pharmaceutical agent sufficient for use in treating a condition indicated herein, either in unit or multiple dosages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe packaging material comprises a label which indicates the use of the pharmaceutical agent contained therein, e.g., for treating conditions assisted by the inhibition of angiogenesis, and the like conditions disclosed herein. The label can further include instructions for use and related information as may be required for marketing. The packaging material can include container(s) for storage of the pharmaceutical agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term packaging material refers to a material such as glass, plastic, paper, foil, and the like capable of holding within fixed means a pharmaceutical agent. Thus, for example, the packaging material can be plastic or glass vials, laminated envelopes and the like containers used to contain a pharamaceutical composition including the pharmaceutical agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe packaging material may include a label that is a tangible expression describing the contents of the article of manufacture and the use of the pharmaceutical agent contained therein.\n\n\n \n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples relating to this invention are illustrative and should not, of course, be construed as specifically limiting the invention.\n\n\n \n1. \nPreparation of Synthetic Peptides\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\na. \nSynthesis Procedure\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe linear and cyclic polypeptides listed in Table 1 were synthesized using standard solid-phase synthesis techniques as, for example, described by \nMerrifield, Adv. Enzymol., 32:221-96, (1969\n), and \nFields, G.B. and Noble, R.L., Int. J. Peptide Protein Res., 35:161-214, (1990\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo grams (g) of BOC-Gly-D-Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Val-OMe (SEQ ID NO 1) were first dissolved in 60 milliliters (ml) of methanol to which was added 1.5 ml of 2 N sodium hydroxide solution to form an admixture. The admixture was then stirred for 3 hours at 20 degrees C (20C). After evaporation, the residue was taken up in water, acidified to \npH\n 3 with diluted HCl and extracted with ethyl acetate. The extract was dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4\n, evaporated again and the resultant BOC-Gly-D-Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Val-OH (SEQ ID NO 2) was stirred at 20C for 2 hours with 20 ml of 2 N HCl in dioxane. The resultant admixture was evaporated to obtain H-Gly-D-Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Val-OH (SEQ ID NO 3) that was subsequently dissolved in a mixture of 1800 ml of dichloromethane and 200 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF) followed by cooling to 0C. Thereafter, 0.5 g of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCI), 0.3 g of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and 0.23 ml of N-methylmorpholine were added successively with stirring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resultant admixture was stirred for a further 24 hours at 0C and then at 20C for another 48 hours. The solution was concentrated and treated with a mixed bed ion exchanger to free it from salts. After the resulting resin was removed by filtration, the clarified solution was evaporated and the residue was purified by chromatography resulting in the recovery of cyclo(-Gly-D-Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Val) (SEQ ID NO 4). The following peptides, listed in Table 1 using single letter code amino acid residue abbreviations and identified by a peptide number designation, were obtained analogously: cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Val) (SEQ ID NO 5); cyclo(Arg-Ala-Asp-D-Phe-Val) (SEQ ID NO 6); cyclo(Arg-D-Ala-Asp-Phe-Val) (SEQ ID NO 9); cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-D-Val) (SEQ ID NO 7); and cyclo (Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-NMeVal) (methylation is at the alpha-amino nitrogen of the amide bond of the valine residue) (SEQ ID NO 15).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA peptide designated as 66203, having an identical sequence to that of peptide 62184, only differed from the latter by containing the salt HCl rather than the TFA salt present in 62184. The same is true for the \npeptides\n 69601 and 62185 and for 85189 and 121974.\n\n\n \nb. \nAlternate Synthesis Procedure\n \n\n\ni. \nSynthesis of cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NmeVal). TFA salt\n \n\n\n \n \n \nFmoc-Arg(Mtr)-Gly-Asp(OBut)-DPhe-NMeVal-ONa is synthesized using solid-phase Merrifield-type procedures by sequentially adding NMeVal, DPhe, Asp(OBut), Gly and Fmoc-Arg(Mtr) in a step-wise manner to a 4-hydroxymethyl-phenoxymethyl-polystyrene resin (Wang type resin) (\ncustomary Merrifield-type methods of peptide synthesis are applied as described in Houben-Weyl, 1.c., \n). The polystyrene resin and amino acid residues precursors are commercially available from Aldrich, Sigma or Fluka chemical companies). After completion of sequential addition of the amino acid residues, the resin is then eliminated from the peptide chain using a 1:1 mixture of TFA/dichloromethane which provides the Fmoc-Arg(Mtr)-Gly-Asp(OBut)-DPhe-NMeVal-OH product. The Fmoc group is then removed with a 1:1 mixture of piperidine/DMF which provides the crude Arg(Mtr)-Gly-Asp(OBut)-DPhe-NMeVal-OH precursor which is then purified by HPLC in the customary manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor cyclization, a solution of 0.6 g of Arg(Mtr)-Gly-Asp(OBut)-DPhe-NMeVal-OH (synthesized above) in 15 ml of DMF (dimethylformamide; Aldrich) is diluted with 85 ml of dichloromethane (Aldrich), and 50 mg of NaHCO\n3\n are added. After cooling in a dry ice/acetone mixture, 40 µl of diphenylphosphoryl azide (Aldrich) are added. After standing at room temperature for 16 hours, the solution is concentrated. The concentrate is gel-filtered (Sephadex G10 column in isopropanol/water 8:2) and then purified by HPLC in the customary manner. Treatment with TFA (trifluoroacetic acid)/H\n2\nO (98:2) gives cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NmeVal) x TFA which is then purified by HPLC in the customary manner; RT = 19.5; FAB-MS (M+H): 589.\n\n\n \nii. \nSynthesis of \"Inner Salt\"\n \n\n\n \n \n \nTFA salt is removed from the above-produced cyclic peptide by suspending the cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NmeVal) x TFA in water followed by evaporation under vacuum to remove the TFA. The cyclic peptide formed is referred to as an \"inner salt\" and is designated cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal). The term \"inner salt\" is used because the cyclic peptide contains two oppositely charged residues which intra-electronically counterbalance each other to form an overall noncharged molecule. One of the charged residues contains an acid moiety and the other charged residue contains an amino moiety. When the acid moiety and the amino moiety are in close proximity to one another, the acid moiety can be deprotonated by the amino moiety which forms a carboxylate/ammonium salt species with an overall neutral charge.\n\n\n \niii. \nHCl treatment to give cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) x HCl\n \n\n\n \n \n \n80 mg of cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) are dissolved in 0.01 M HCl five to six times and freeze dried after each dissolving operation. Subsequent purification by HPLC give cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) x HCl; FAB-MS (M+H): 589.\n\n\n \niv. \nMethane sulfonic acid treatment to give cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) x MeSO\n \n \n3\n \n \nH\n \n\n\n \n \n \n80 mg of cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) are dissolved in 0.01 M MeSO\n3\nH (methane sulfonic acid) five to six times and freeze dried after each dissolving operation. Subsequent purification by HPLC give cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) x MeSO\n3\nH; RT = 17.8 ; FAB-MS (M+H): 589.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternative methods of cyclization include derivatizing the side group chains of an acyclic peptide precursor with sulfhydryl moieties, and when exposed to slightly higher than normal physiological pH conditions (pH 7.5), intramolecularly forms disulfide bonds with other sulfhydryl groups present in the molecule to form a cyclic peptide. Additionally, the C-terminus carboxylate moiety of an acyclic peptide precurosor can be reacted with a free sulfhydryl moiety present within the molecule for producing thioester cyclized peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn inhibition of angiogenesis assays as described in Example 7 where the synthetic peptides were used, the 66203 peptide in HCl was slightly more effective in inhibiting angiogenesis than the identical peptide in TFA.\n\n \nTable 1\n \n \n \nPeptide\n \nAmino Acid Sequence\n \nSEO ID NO\n \n \n \nDesignation\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n62181\n \n \n \ncyclo(GrGDFV)\n \n4\n \n \n \n62184\n \n(66203*)\n \ncyclo(RGDfV)\n \n5\n \n \n \n62185\n \n(69601*)\n \ncyclo (RADfV)\n \n6\n \n \n \n62187\n \n \n \ncyclo(RGDFv)\n \n7\n \n \n \n62880\n \n \n \nYTAECKPQVTRGDVF\n \n8\n \n \n \n62186\n \n \n \ncyclo(RaDFV)\n \n9\n \n \n \n62175\n \n \n \ncyclo(ARGDfL)\n \n10\n \n \n \n62179\n \n \n \ncyclo (GRGDfL)\n \n11\n \n \n \n62411\n \n \n \nTRQVVCDLGNPM\n \n12\n \n \n \n62503\n \n \n \nGVVRNNEALARLS\n \n13\n \n \n \n62502\n \n \n \nTDVNGDGRHDL\n \n14\n \n \n \n121974\n \n(85189*)\n \ncyclo (RGD-NH\n2\nMe-V)\n \n15\n \n \n \n112784\n \n \n \ncyclo (RGEf-NH\n2\nMe-V)\n \n16\n \n \n \nhump-2\n \n(410-631)**\n \n \n \n17\n \n \n \nhuMMP-2\n \n(439-631)**\n \n \n \n18\n \n \n \nhuMMP-2\n \n(439-512)**\n \n \n \n19\n \n \n \nhuMMP-2\n \n(439-546)**\n \n \n \n20\n \n \n \nhuMMP-2\n \n(510-631)**\n \n \n \n21\n \n \n \nhuMMP-2\n \n(543-631)**\n \n \n \n22\n \n \n \nchMMP-2\n \n(410-637)***\n \n \n \n23\n \n \n \nchMMP-2\n \n(445-637)***\n \n \n \n24\n \n \n \nchMMP-2\n \n(445-518)***\n \n \n \n25\n \n \n \nchMMP-2\n \n(445-552)***\n \n \n \n26\n \n \n \nchMMP-2\n \n(516-637)***\n \n \n \n27\n \n \n \nchMMP-2\n \n(549-637)***\n \n \n \n28\n \n \n \n \n \n* The peptides designated with an asterisk are prepared in HCl and are identical in sequence to the peptide designated on the same line; the peptides without an asterisk are prepared in TFA.

The chicken MMP-2 sequences are listed with the natural cysteine residues but not with the engineered cysteine residues as described for the fusion peptides as described above.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n2. \nMonoclonal Antibodies\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibody LM609 secreted by hybridoma ATCC HB 9537 was produced using standard hybridoma methods by immunization with isolated α\nv\nβ\n3\n adsorbed onto Sepharose-lentil lectin beads. The α\nv\nβ\n3\n had been isolated from human melanoma cells designated M21, and antibody was produced as described by \nCheresh et al., J. Biol. Chem., 262:17703-17711 (1987\n). M21 cells were provided by Dr. D. L. Morton (University of California at Los Angeles, CA) and grown in suspension cultures in RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 mg/ml gentamicin sulfate and 10% fetal calf serum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibody LM609 has been shown to specifically immunoreact with α\nv\nβ\n3\n complex, and not immunoreact with α\nv\n subunit, with β\n3\n subunit, or with other integrins.\n\n\n \n3. \nCharacterization of the Tissue Distribution of α\n \n \nv\n \n \nβ\n \n \n3\n \n \nExpression\n \n\n\nA. \nImmunofluorescence with Anti-Integrin Receptor Antibodies\n \n\n\n \n \n \nDuring wound healing, the basement membranes of blood vessels express several adhesive proteins, including von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, and fibrin. In addition, several members of the integrin family of adhesion receptors are expressed on the surface of cultured smooth muscle and endothelial cells. See, \nCheresh, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.. USA, 84:6471 (1987\n); \nJanat et al., J. Cell Physiol., 151:588 (1992\n); and \nCheng et al., J. Cell Physiol., 139:275 (1989\n). Among these integrins is α\nv\nβ\n3\n, the endothelial cell receptor for von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen (fibrin), and fibronectin as described by \nCheresh, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.. USA, 84:6471 (1987\n). This integrin initiates a calcium-dependent signaling pathway leading to endothelial cell migration, and therefore appears to play a fundamental role in vascular cell biology as described by \nLeavelsey et al., J. Cell Biol., 121:163 (1993\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo investigate the expression of α\nv\nβ\n3\n during angiogenesis, human wound granulation tissue or adjacent normal skin was obtained from consenting patients, washed with 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline and embedded in O.T.C medium (Tissue Tek). The embedded tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for approximately 30 to 45 seconds. Six micron thick sections were cut from the frozen blocks on a cryostat microtome for subsequent immunoperoxidase staining with antibodies specific for either β\n3\n integrins (α\nv\nβ\n3\n or α\nIIb\nβ\n3\n) or the β\n1\n subfamily of integrins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of the staining of normal human skin and wound granulation tissue are shown in \nFigures 1A-1D\n. Monoclonal antibodies AP3 and LM534, directed to β\n3\n and β\n1\n integrins, respectively, were used for immunohistochemical analysis of frozen sections. Experiments with tissue from four different human donors yielded identical results. The photomicrographs are shown at magnification of 300x.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe α\nv\nβ\n3\n integrin was abundantly expressed on blood vessels in granulation tissue (\nFigure 1B\n) but was not detectable in the dermis and epithelium of normal skin from the same donor (\nFigure 1A\n). In contrast, β\n1\n integrins were abundantly expressed on blood vessels and stromal cells in both normal skin (\nFigure 1C\n) and granulation tissue (\nFigure 1D\n) and, as previously shown as described by \nAdams et al., Cell, 63:425 (1991\n), on the basal cells within the epithelium.\n\n\n \nB. \nImmunofluorescence with Anti-Ligand Antibodies\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAdditional sections of the human normal skin and granulation tissues prepared above were also examined for the presence of the ligands for the β\n3\n and β\n1\n integrins, von Willebrand factor and laminin, respectively. Von Willebrand factor localized to the blood vessels in normal skin (\nFigure 2A\n) and granulation tissue (\nFigure 2B\n), whereas laminin localized to all blood vessels as well as the epithelial basement membrane in both tissue preparations (\nFigures 2C and 2D\n).\n\n\n \nC. \nDistribution of Anti-α\n \n \nv\n \n \nβ\n \n \n3\n \n \nAntibodies on Cancer Tissue\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn addition to the above analyses, biopsies of cancer tissue from human patients were also examined for the presence and distribution of α\nv\nβ\n3\n. The tissues were prepared as described in Example 1A with the exception that they were stained with monoclonal antibody LM609 prepared in Example 2 that is specific for the integrin receptor complex, α\nv\nβ\n3\n. In addition, tumors were also prepared for microscopic histological analysis by fixing representative examples of tumors in Bulins Fixative for 8 hours and serial sections cut and H&E stained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of immunoperoxidase staining of bladder, colon breast and lung cancer tissues are shown in \nFigures 3A-3D\n, respectively. α\nv\nβ\n3\n is abundantly expressed only on the blood vessels present in the four cancer biopsies analyzed and not on any other cells present in the tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results described herein thus show that the α\nv\nβ\n3\n integrin receptor is selectively expressed in specific tissue types, namely granulated, metastatic tissues and other tissues in which angiogenesis is occurring and not normal tissue where the formation of new blood vessels has stopped. These tissues therefore provide an ideal target for therapeutic aspects of this invention.\n\n\n \n4. \nIdentification of α\n \n \nv\n \n \nβ\n \n \n3\n \n \n-Specific Synthetic Peptides Detected by Inhibition of Cell Attachment and by a Ligand-Receptor Binding Assay\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\nA. \nInhibition of Cell Attachment\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs one means to determine integrin receptor specificity of the antagonists of this invention, inhibition of cell attachment assays were performed as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, CS-1 hamster melanoma cells lacking expression of α\nv\nβ\n3\n and α\nv\nβ\n3\n were first transfected with an plasmid for expressing the β\n3\n subunit as previously described by \nFilardo et al., J. Cell Biol., 130:441-450 (1995\n). Specificity of potential α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists was determined by the ability to block the binding of α\nv\nβ\n3\n-expressing CS-1 cells to VN or laminin coated plates. As an example of a typical assay, the wells were first coated with 10 ug/ml substrate overnight. After rinsing and blocking with 1% heat-denatured BSA in PBS at room temperature for 30 minutes, peptide 85189 (SEQ ID NO 15) over a concentration range of 0.0001 uM to 100 uM, was separately mixed with CS-1 cells for applying to wells with a cell number of 50,000 cells/well. After a 10-15 minute incubation at 37C, the solution containing the cells and peptides was discarded. The number of attached cells was then determined following staining with 1% crystal violet. Cell associated crystal violet was eluted by the addition of 100 microliters (ul) of 10% acetic acid. Cell adhesion was quantified by measuring the optical density of the eluted crystal violet at a wave length of 600 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 21\n shows the result of a typical assay with an α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist, here \npeptide\n 85189. No inhibition was detected with the peptide on laminin-coated surfaces. In contrast, complete inhibition of binding was obtained on VN-coated surfaces with a peptide concentration of 10 uM or greater, as shown with the dose-response curve.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar assays were performed with fusion proteins containing various regions of the MMP-2 protein. The MMP-2-derived polypeptides include regions of the C-terminus of MMP-2 active in the binding interaction with α\nv\nβ\n3\n and thereby capable of inhibiting MMP-2 activation and associated activities. These polypeptides are prepared' either as synthetic polypeptides having a sequence derived from the C-terminal domain of MMP-2 as described in Example 1 or as fusion proteins including all or a portion of the C-terminal domain of MMP-2, prepared as described below. MMP-2 C-terminal molecules are presented for both chicken and human specific sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chicken-derived MMP-2 C-terminal domain, also referred to as the hemopexin domain immediately contiguous with the hinge region, comprises the amino acid residues 445-637 of MMP-2. The complete nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequence of chicken MMP-2 is described below. The human MMP-2 nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequence is also described below. The C-terminal domain in the human MMP-2 that corresponds to the chicken region of 445-637 begin at amino acid residue 439 and ends with 631 due to six missing residues from the human sequence as shown in \nFigures 22A\n and \n22B\n. Both human- and chicken-derived C-terminal MMP-2 synthetic peptides for use in practicing the methods of this invention are listed in Table 1. The amino acid residue sequences of the synthetic peptides are the same as those generated by the recombinant fusion protein counterparts but without the GST fusion component. The C-terminal MMP-2 fusion proteins derived from both chicken and human are prepared as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA MMP-2 fusion protein is a chimeric polypeptide having a sequence of MMP-2 C-terminal domain or a portion thereof fused (operatively linked by covalent peptide bond) to a carrier (fusion) protein, such as glutathione sulfhydryl transferase (GST).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo amplify various regions of chicken and human MMP-2, primer sequences were designed based on the known respective cDNA sequences of chicken and human MMP-2. The complete top strand of the cDNA nucleotide sequence of unprocessed chicken MMP-2, also referred to as progelatinase, is shown in \nFigures 22A\n and \n22B\n along with the deduced amino acid sequence shown on the second line (\nAimes et al., Biochem. J., 300:729-736, 1994\n). The third and fourth lines of the figure respectively show the deduced amino acid sequence of human (\nCollier et al., J. Biol, Chem., 263:6579-6587 (1988\n)) and mouse MMP-2 (\nReponen et al., J. Biol. Chem., 267:7856-7862 (1992\n)). Identical residues are indicated by dots while the differing residues are given by their one letter IUPAC lettering. Missing residues are indicated by a dash. The numbering of the amino acid residues starts from the first residue of the proenzyme, with the residues of the signal peptide being given negative numbers. The nucleotide sequence is numbered accordingly. The putative initation of translation (ATG) is marked with three forward arrowheads and the translation termination signal (TGA) is indicated by an asterisk. The amino terminal sequences for the chicken proenzyme and active enzyme are contained with diamonds and single arrowheads. The chicken progelatinase nucleotide and amino acid residue sequences are listed together as SEQ ID NO 29 while the encoded amino acid residue sequence is listed separately as \nSEQ ID NO\n 30.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTemplates for generating amplified regions of chicken MMP-2 were either a cDNA encoding the full-length mature chicken MMP-2 polypeptide provided by Dr. J. P. Quigley of the State University of New York at Stoney Brook, New York or a cDNA generated from a total cellular RNA template derived by standard techniques from an excised sample of chicken chorioallantoic membrane tissue. For the latter, the cDNA was obtained with MuLV reverse transcriptase and a downstream primer specific for the 3'-terminal nucleotides, 5'ATTGAATTCTTCTACAGTTCA3' (SEQ ID NO 31), the 5' and 3' ends of which was respectively complementary to nucleotides 1932-1912 of the published chick MMP-2 sequence. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed according to the specifications of the manufacturer for the GeneAmp RNA PCR Kit (Perkin Elmer). The primer was also engineered to contain an internal EcoRI restriction site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom either of the above-described cDNA templates, a number of C-terminal regions of chicken MMP-2, each having the natural cysteine residue at \nposition\n 637 at the carboxy terminus, were obtained by PCR with the 3' primer listed above (SEQ ID NO 31) paired with one of a number of 5' primers listed below. The amplified regions encoded the following MMP-2 fusion proteins, having sequences corresponding to the amino acid residue positions as shown in \nFigures 22A\n and \n22B\n and also listed in SEQ ID NO 30: 1) 203-637; 2) 274-637; 3) 292-637; 4) 410-637; 5) 445-637. Upstream or 5' primers for amplifying each of the nucleotide regions for encoding the above-listed MMP-2 fusion proteins were designed to encode the polypeptide start sites 3' to an engineered, i.e., PCR-introduced, internal BamHI restriction site to allow for directional ligation into either pGEX-1λT or pGEX-3X expression vectors. The 5' primers included the following sequences, the 5' and 3' ends of which correspond to the indicated 5' and 3' nucleotide positions of the chicken MMP-2 sequence as shown in \nFigure 22A\n and \n22B\n (the amino acid residue position start sites are also indicated for each primer): 1) Nucleotides 599-619, encoding a 203 start site 5'ATGGGATCCACTGCAAATTTC3' (SEQ ID NO 32); 2) Nucleotides 809-830, encoding a 274 start site 5'GCCGGATCCATGACCAGTGTA3' (SEQ ID NO 33); 3) Nucleotides 863-883, encoding a 292 start site 5'GTGGGATCCCTGAAGACTATG3' (SEQ ID NO 34); 4) Nucleotides 1217-1237, encoding a 410 start 5'AGGGGATCCTTAAGGGGATTC3' (SEQ ID NO 35); and 5) Nucleotides 1325-1345, encoding a 445 start site 5'CTCGGATCCTCTGCAAGCACG3' (SEQ ID NO 36).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe indicated nucleotide regions of the template cDNA were subsequently amplified for 35 cycles (annealing temperature 55C) according to the manufacturer's instructions for the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim). The resulting PCR products were gel-purified, digested with BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes, and repurified before ligation into either pGEX-1λT or pGEX-3X vector (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) which had been similarly digested as well as dephosphorylated prior to the ligation reaction. The choice of plasmid was based upon the required reading frame of the amplification product. Competent \nE. coli\n strain BSJ72 or BL21 cells were transformed with the separate constructs by heat shock. The resulting colonies were screened for incorporation of the respective MMP-2 fusion protein-encoding plasmid by PCR prior to dideoxy sequencing of positive clones to verify the integrity of the introduced coding sequence. In addition, verification of incorporation of plasmid was confirmed by expression of the appropriately-sized GST-MMP-2 fusion protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurification of each of the recombinant GST-MMP-2 fusion proteins was performed using IPTG-induced log-phase cultures essentially as described by the manufacturer for the GST Gene Fusion System (Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, recovered bacteria were lysed by sonication and incubated with detergent prior to clarification and immobilization of the recombinant protein on sepharose 4B-coupled glutathione (Pharmacia Biotech). After extensive washing, the immobilized fusion proteins were separately eluted from the affinity matrix with 10 mM reduced glutathione in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and dialyzed extensively against PBS to remove residual glutathione prior to use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior attempts to produce fusion proteins between chicken MMP-2 \nresidues\n 445 and 637 that only had one encoded cysteine residue resulted in insoluble products. Therefore, in order to generate additional soluble MMP-2 fusion proteins derived from the C-terminal region that did not include an endogenous terminal cysteine residue as present in the previously-described fusion protein, nucleotide sequences were introduced into amplified MMP-2 regions to encode a cysteine residue if necessary depending on the particular fusion protein. A cysteine residue is naturally present in the chicken MMP-2 sequence at position 446 and at \nposition\n 637. In the human sequence, these positions correspond respectively to 440 and 631. Therefore, fusion proteins were designed to contain engineered terminal cysteine residues at the amino- or carboxy-terminus of the chicken MMP-2 sequences of interest so as to provide for disulfide-bonding with the naturally occurring cysteine at the other terminus, as required by the construct.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOligonucleotide primers were accordingly designed to allow for amplification of chicken MMP-2 C-terminal regions for expression of soluble MMP-2/GST fusion proteins. Amplified chicken MMP-2 C-terminal regions included those for encoding amino acid residue positions 445-518, 445-552, 516-637 and 549-637. For fusion proteins containing residue 517, the naturally encoded tyrosine residue was substituted for a cysteine to allow for disulfide bonding with either cysteine at \nresidue position\n 446 or 637. For fusion proteins containing residue 551, the naturally encoded tryptophan residue was substituted for a cysteine to allow for disulfide bonding with either naturally encoded cysteine at \nresidue position\n 446 or 637.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, the pGEX-3X plasmid construct encoding the recombinant GST/MMP-2(410-637) fusion protein prepared above was used as a template for amplification according to the manufacturer's protocol for the Expand High Fidelity PCR Kit (Boehringer Mannheim) utilizing a set of oligonucleotide primers whose design was based on the published chicken MMP-2 sequence (also shown in \nFigures 22A\n and \n22B\n. One upstream primer, designed to encode a chicken MMP-2 protein start site at position 445 after an engineered internal BamHI endonuclease restriction site for insertion into the pGEX-3X GST vector, had the nucleotide sequence (5'CTCGGATCCTCTGCAAGCACG3' (SEQ ID NO 37)). The 5' and 3' ends of the primer respectively corresponded to positions 1325-1345 of the chicken MMP-2 sequence in the figure. Another upstream primer, designed to encode a chicken MMP-2 protein start site at position 516 after an engineered internal BamHI restriction site for insertion into the pGEX-1λT GST vector and to encode a cysteine residue at position 517, had the nucleotide sequence (5'GCAGGATCCGAGTGCTGGGTTTATAC3' (SEQ ID NO 38)). The 5' and 3' ends of the primer respectively corresponded to positions 1537-1562 of the chicken MMP-2 sequence. A third upstream primer, designed to encode a chicken MMP-2 protein start site at position 549 following an engineered internal EcoRI endonuclease restriction site for insertion into the pGEX-1λT GST vector and to encode a cysteine residue at position 551, had the nucleotide sequence (5'GCAGAATTCAACTGTGGCAGAAACAAG3' (SEQ ID NO 39)). The 5' and 3' ends of the primer respectively corresponded to positions 1639-1665 of the chicken MMP-2 sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese upstream primers were separately used with one of the following downstream primers listed below to produce the above-described regions from the C-terminal domain of chicken MMP-2. A first downstream primer (antisense), designed to encode a chicken MMP-2 protein termination site at position 518, to encode a cysteine residue at position 517, and to contain an internal EcoRI endonuclease restriction site for insertion into a GST vector, had the nucleotide sequence (5'GTAGAATTCCAGCACTCATTTCCTGC3' (SEQ ID NO 40)). The 5' and 3' ends of the primer, written in the 5'-3' direction, were respectively complementary in part to positions 1562-1537 of the chicken MMP-2 sequence. A second downstream primer, designed to encode a chicken MMP-2 protein termination site at position 552, to encode a cysteine residue at position 551, and to contain an internal-EcoRI endonuclease restriction site for insertion into a GST vector, had the nucleotide sequence (5'TCTGAATTCTGCCACAGTTGAAGG3' (SEQ ID NO 41)). The 5' and 3' ends of the primer, written in the 5'-3' direction, were respectively complementary in part to positions 1666-1643 of the chicken MMP-2 sequence. A third downstream primer, designed to encode a chicken MMP-2 protein termination site at \nposition\n 637 and to contain an internal EcoRI endonuclease restriction site for insertion into a GST vector, had the nucleotide sequence (5'ATTGAATTCTTCTACAGTTCA3' (SEQ ID NO 42)). The 5' and 3' ends of the primer, written in the 5'-3' direction, were respectively complementary in part to positions 1932-1912 of the chicken MMP-2 sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe regions of the chicken MMP-2 carboxy terminus bounded by the above upstream and downstream primers, used in particular combinations to produce the fusion proteins containing at least one engineered cysteine residue as described above, were separately amplified for 30 cycles with an annealing temperature of 55C according to the manufacturer's instructions for the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim). The resulting amplification products were separately purified, digested with BamHI and or EcoRI restriction enzymes as necessary, and repurified before ligation into the appropriate GST fusion protein vector, either pGEX-3X or pGEX-1λT, as indicated above by the reading frame of the upstream oligonucleotide primer. For ligating the amplified MMP-2 products, the vectors were similarly digested as well as dephosphorylated prior to the ligation reaction. Competent \nE. coli\n strain BL21 cells were then separately transformed with the resultant MMP-2-containing vector constructs by heat shock. Resulting colonies were then screened for incorporation of the appropriate fusion protein-encoding plasmid by PCR and production of the appropriate sized GST-fusion protein prior to dideoxy sequencing of positive clones to verify the integrity of the introduced coding sequence. Purification of recombinant GST fusion proteins were then performed using IPTG-induced log-phase cultures essentially as described above for producing the other GST-MMP-2 fusion proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of inhibition of cell attachment assays with various chicken MMP-2 proteins as well as with other peptides indicate that intact MMP-2, the fusion protein CTMMP-2(2-4) from residues 445-637 and peptide 66203 (SEQ ID NO 5) but not MMP-2 (1-445) and \ncontrol peptide\n 69601 inhibited β\n3\n-expressing CS-1 cell adhesion to vitronectin but not laminin, and thereby inhibited vitronectin receptor (α\nv\nβ\n3\n) binding to vitronectin by interfering with normal α\nv\nβ\n3\n binding activity. Other tested CTMMP-2 fusion proteins 7-1 from residues 274-637, 10-1 from residues 292-637 and 4-3 from residues 274-400 had less affect on cell adhesion compared to 2-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the chicken MMP-2 GST-fusion proteins described above, two human MMP-2 GST fusion proteins were produced for expressing amino acid regions 203-631 and 439-631 of the mature human MMP-2 proenzyme polypeptide. The indicated regions correspond respectively to chicken MMP-2 regions 203-637 and 445-637. Human MMP-2-GST fusion proteins were produced by PCR as described above for the chicken MMP-2-GST fusion proteins utilizing a cDNA template that encoded the entire human MMP-2 open reading frame provided by Dr. W. G. Stetler-Stevenson at the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD. Upstream 5' primer sequences were designed based upon the previously published sequence of human MMP-2 (\nCollier et al., J. Biol. Chem., 263:6579-6587 (1988\n) and to encode an introduced internal EcoRI restriction site to allow for insertion of the amplified products into the appropriate expression vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne upstream primer, designed to encode a human MMP-2 protein start site at \nposition\n 203 after an engineered internal EcoRI endonuclease restriction site for insertion into the pGEX-1λT GST vector, had the nucleotide sequence (5'GATGAATTCTACTGCAAGTT3' (SEQ ID NO 43)). The 5' and 3' ends of the primer respectively corresponded to positions 685-704 of the human MMP-2 open reading frame sequence. Another upstream primer, designed to encode a human MMP-2 protein start site at position 439 after an engineered internal EcoRI restriction site for insertion into the pGEX-1λT GST vector, had the nucleotide sequence (5'CACTGAATTCATCTGCAAACA3' (SEQ ID NO 44)). The 5' and 3' ends of the primer respectively corresponded to positions 1392 and 1412 of the human MMP-2 open reading frame sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the above primers were used separately with a downstream primer, having 5' and 3' ends respectively complementary to bases 1998 and 1978 of the human MMP-2 sequence that ends distal to the MMP-2 open reading frame and directs protein termination after \namino acid residue\n 631. The amplified products produced expressed fusion proteins containing human MMP-2 amino acid residues 203-631 (SEQ ID NO 45) and 439-631 (SEQ ID NO 18).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting PCR products were purified, digested with EcoRI and repurified for ligation into a pGEX-1λT plasmid that was similarly digested and dephosphorylated prior to the ligation reaction. Cells were transformed as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther human MMP-2 fusion proteins containing amino acid residues 410-631 (SEQ ID NO 17), 439-512 (SEQ ID NO 19), 439-546 (SEQ ID NO 20), 510-631 (SEQ ID NO 21) and 543-631 (SEQ ID NO 22) are also prepared as described above for use in the methods of this invention.\n\n\n \nB. \nLigand-Receptor Binding Assay\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe synthetic peptides prepared in Example 1 along with the MMP-2 fusion proteins described above were further screened by measuring their ability to antagonize α\nv\nβ\n3\n and α\nIIb\nβ\n3\n receptor binding activity in purified ligand-receptor binding assays. The method for these binding studies has been described by \nBarbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.. USA. 90:10003-10007 (1993\n), \nSmith et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265:11008-11013 (1990\n), and \nPfaff et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269:20233-20238 (1994\n), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHerein described is a method of identifying antagonists in a ligand-receptor binding assay in which the receptor is immobilized to a solid support and the ligand and antagonist are soluble. Also described is a ligand-receptor binding assay in which the ligand is immobilized to a solid support and the receptor and antagonists are soluble.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, selected purified integrins were separately immobilized in Titertek microtiter wells at a coating concentration of 50 nanograms (ng) per well. The purification of the receptors used in the ligand-receptor binding assays are well known in the art and are readily obtainable with methods familiar to one of ordinary skill in the art. After incubation for 18 hours at 4C, nonspecific binding sites on the plate were blocked with 10 milligrams/milliliter (mg/ml) of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline. For inhibition studies, various concentrations of selected peptides from Table 1 were tested for the ability to block the binding of \n125\nI-vitronectin or \n125\nI-fibrinogen to the integrin receptors, α\nv\nβ\n3\n and α\nIIb\nβ\n3\n. Although these ligands exhibit optimal binding for a particular integrin, vitronectin for α\nv\nβ\n3\n and fibrinogen for α\nIIb\nβ\n3\n. inhibition of binding studies using peptides to block the binding of fibrinogen to either receptor allowed for the accurate determination of the amount in micromoles (uM) of peptide necessary to half-maximally inhibit the binding of receptor to ligand. Radiolabeled ligands were used at concentrations of 1 nM and binding was challenged separately with unlabeled synthetic peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing a three hour incubation, free ligand was removed by washing and bound ligand was detected by gamma counting. The data from the assays where selected cyclic peptides listed in Table 1 were used to inhibit the binding of receptors and radiolabeled fibrinogen to separately immobilized α\nv\nβ\n3\n and α\nIIb\nβ\n3\n receptors were highly reproducible with the error between data points typically below 11%. The IC\n50\n data in micromoles (IC\n50\n uM) are expressed as the average of duplicate data points ± the standard deviation as shown in Table 2.\n\n \nTable 2\n \n \n \nPeptide No.\n \nα\nv\nβ\n3\n (IC\n50\n µM)\n \nα\nIIb\nβ\n3\n (IC\n50\n µM)\n \n \n \n \n62181\n \n1.96 ± 0.62\n \n14.95 ± 7.84\n \n \n \n62184\n \n0.05 ± 0.001\n \n0.525 ± 0.10\n \n \n \n62185\n \n0.885 ± 0.16\n \n100 ± 0.001\n \n \n \n62187\n \n0.05 ± 0.001\n \n0.26 ± 0.056\n \n \n \n62186\n \n57.45 ± 7.84\n \n100 ± 0.001\n \n \n \n62175\n \n1.05 ± 0.07\n \n0.63 ± 0.18\n \n \n \n62179\n \n0.395 ± .21\n \n0.055 ± 0.007\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the RGD-containing or RGD-derivatized cyclic peptides 62181, 62184, 62185 and 62187, each having one D- amino acid residue, exhibited preferential inhibition of fibrinogen binding to the α\nv\nβ\n3\n receptor as measured by the lower concentration of peptide required for half-maximal inhibition as compared to that for the α\nIIb\nβ\n3\n receptor. In contrast, the other RGD-containing or RGD-derivatized cyclic peptides, 62186, 62175 and 62179, were either not as effective in blocking fibrinogen binding to α\nv\nβ\n3\n or exhibited preferential inhibition of fibrinogen binding to α\nIIb\nβ\n3\n as compared to α\nv\nβ\n3\n. These results are consistent with those recently published by \nPfaff, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269:20233-20238 (1994\n) in which the cyclic peptide RGD\nF\nV (wherein \nF\n indicates a D- amino acid residue) specifically inhibited binding of fibrinogen to the α\nv\nβ\n3\n integrin and not to the α\nIIb\nβ\n3\n or α\n5\nβ\n1\n integrins. Similar inhibition of binding assays were performed with linearized peptides having or lacking an RGD motif, the sequences of which were derived from the α\nv\n receptor subunit, α\nIIb\n receptor subunit or vitronectin ligand amino acid residue sequences. The sequences of the linear peptides, 62880 (VN-derived amino acid residues 35-49), 62411 (α\nv\n-derived amino acid residues 676-687); 62503 (α\nv\n-derived amino acid residues 655-667) and 62502 (α\nIIb\n-derived amino acid residues 296-306), are listed in Table 1. Each of these peptides were used in separate assays to inhibit the binding of either vitronectin (VN) or fibrinogen (FG) to either (α\nIIb\nβ\n3\n or α\nv\nβ\n3\n. The IC\n50\n data in micromoles (IC\n50\n uM) of an individual assay for each experiment is shown in Table 3.\n\n \nTable 3\n \n \n \nPeptide No.\n \nα\nIIb\nβ\n3\n IC\n50\n \n \n(uM)\n \nα\nv\nβ\n3\n IC\n50\n \n \n(uM)\n \n \n \n \n \nFG\n \nVN\n \nFG\n \nVN\n \n \n \n \n62880\n \n4.2\n \n0.98\n \n<0.1\n \n0.5\n \n \n \n62411\n \n>100\n \n>100\n \n>100\n \n>100\n \n \n \n62503\n \n>100\n \n>100\n \n>100\n \n>100\n \n \n \n62502\n \n90\n \n5\n \n>100\n \n>100\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of inhibition of ligand binding assays to selected integrin receptors with linearized peptides show that only peptide 62880 was effective at inhibiting the half-maximal binding of either FG or VN to a\nv\nβ\n3\n as measured by the lower concentration of peptide required for half-maximal inhibition as compared to α\nIIb\nβ\n3\n receptor. None of the other linearized peptides were effective at blocking ligand binding to α\nv\nβ\n3\n although peptide 62502 was effective at blocking VN binding to α\nIIb\nβ\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other ligand receptor binding assays performed as described above with the exception that detection of binding or inhibition thereof was with ELISA and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, the ligands VN, MMP-2 and fibronectin at a range of 5 - 50 ng/well and listed in the order of effectiveness were shown to bind to immobilized α\nv\nβ\n3\n receptor while collagen did not. In addition, the ability of peptides to inhibit the binding of either MMP-2 or VN to immobilized α\nv\nβ\n3\n was assessed with peptides 69601 (SEQ ID NO 6) and 66203 (SEQ ID NO 5). \nOnly peptide\n 66203 was effective at inhibiting the binding of either substrate to the α\nv\nβ\n3\n receptor while the \ncontrol peptide\n 69601 failed to have an effect with either ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecificity of MMP-2 binding to integrin receptors was confirmed with a solid phase receptor binding assay in which iodinated MMP-2 was shown to bind to α\nv\nβ\n3\n and not to α\nIIb\nβ\n3\n that had been immobilized on a solid phase (300 bound cpm versus approximately 10 bound CPM). The ability of an MMP-2 derived peptide or fusion protein to inhibit the specific binding of MMP-2 to α\nv\nβ\n3\n was demonstrated in a comparable assay, the results of which are shown in \nFigure 23\n. The GST-CTMMP-2(445-637) (also referred to as CTMMP-2(2-4)) fusion protein prepared as described above, labeled GST-MAID, inhibited the binding of iodinated MMP-2 to α\nv\nβ\n3\n while GST alone had no effect with levels of bound CPM comparable to wells receiving no inhibitor at all (labeled NT). The MMP-2 fusion protein referred to as CTMMP-2(274-637), also referred to as CTMMP-2(10-1), failed to inhibit the binding of labeled MMP-2 to α\nv\nβ\n3.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecificity of receptor interaction with MMP-2-derived antagonists was confirmed with binding and inhibition of binding solid phase assays. CTMMP-2(2-4), labeled in \nFigure 24\n as [125I] GST2-4, bound to α\nv\nβ\n3\n and not to α\nIIb\nβ\n3\n while CTMMP-2(10-1), labeled in \nFigure 24\n as [125I]GST10-1, did not bind to either receptor in the \nin vitro\n solid phase assay. In addition, the binding of labeled GST2-4 was competed by unlabeled GST2-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the ligand-receptor assay described herein can be used to screen for both circular or linearized synthetic peptides that exhibit selective specificity for a particular integrin receptor, specifically α\nv\nβ\n3\n, as used as vitronectin receptor (α\nv\nβ\n3\n) antagonists in practicing this invention.\n\n\n \n5. \nCharacterization of the Untreated Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM)\n \n\n\nA. \nPreparation of the CAM\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAngiogenesis can be induced on the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) after normal embryonic angiogenesis has resulted in the formation of mature blood vessels. Angiogenesis has been shown to be induced in response to specific cytokines or tumor fragments as described by \nLeibovich et al., Nature, 329:630 (1987\n) and \nAusprunk et al., Am. J. Pathol., 79:597 (1975\n). CAMs were prepared from chick embryos for subsequent induction of angiogenesis and inhibition thereof as described in Examples 6 and 7, respectively. Ten day old chick embryos were obtained from McIntyre Poultry (Lakeside, CA) and incubated at 37C with 60% humidity. A small hole was made through the shell at the end of the egg directly over the air sac with the use of a small crafts drill (Dremel, Division of Emerson Electric Co. Racine WI). A second hole was drilled on the broad side of the egg in a region devoid of embryonic blood vessels determined previously by candling the egg. Negative pressure was applied to the original hole, which resulted in the CAM (chorioallantoic membrane) pulling away from the shell membrane and creating a false air sac over the CAM. A 1.0 centimeter (cm) x 1.0 cm square window was cut through the shell over the dropped CAM with the use of a small model grinding wheel (Dremel). The small window allowed direct access to the underlying CAM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resultant CAM preparation was then either used at 6 days of embryogenesis, a stage marked by active neovascularization, without additional treatment to the CAM reflecting the model used for evaluating effects on embryonic neovascularization or used at 10 days of embryogenesis where angiogenesis has subsided. The latter preparation was thus used in this invention for inducing renewed angiogenesis in response to cytokine treatment or tumor contact as described in Example 6.\n\n\n \nB. \nHistology of the CAM\n \n\n\n \n \n \nTo analyze the microscopic structure of the chick embryo CAMs and/or human tumors that were resected from the chick embryos as described in Example 8, the CAMs and tumors were prepared for frozen sectioning as described in Example 3A. Six micron (um) thick sections were cut from the frozen blocks on a cryostat microtome for immunofluorescence analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4\n shows a typical photomicrograph of an area devoid of blood vessels in an untreated 10 day old CAM. As angiogenesis in the CAM system is subsiding by this stage of embryogenesis, the system is useful in this invention for stimulating the production of new vasculature from existing vessels from adjacent areas into areas of the CAM currently lacking any vessels.\n\n\n \nC. \nIntegrin Profiled in the CAM Detected by Immunofluorescence\n \n\n\n \n \n \nTo view the tissue distribution of integrin receptors present in CAM tissues, 6 um frozen sections of both tumor tissue and chick embryo CAM tissues were fixed in acetone for 30 seconds and stained by immunofluorescence with 10 micrograms/milliliter (ug/ml) mAb CSAT, a monoclonal antibody specific for the β\n1\n integrin subunit as described by \nBuck et al., J. Cell Biol., 107:2351 (1988\n) and thus used for controls, or LM609 as prepared in Example 2. Primary staining was followed by staining with a 1:250 dilution of goat anti-mouse rhodamine labeled secondary antibody (Tago) to allow for the detection of the primary immunoreaction product. The sections were then analyzed with a Zeiss immunofluorescence compound microscope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of the immunofluorescence analysis show that the mature blood vessels present in an untreated 10 day chick embryo expressed the integrin β\n1\n subunit (\nFigure 5A\n). In contrast, in a serial section of the tissue shown in \nFigure 5A\n, no immunoreactivity with LM609 was revealed (\nFigure 5B\n). Thus, the integrin α\nv\nβ\n3\n detected by the LM609 antibody was not actively being expressed by the mature blood vessels present in a 10 day old untreated chick embryo. As shown in the CAM model and in the following Examples, while the blood vessels are undergoing new growth in normal embryogenesis or induced by either cytokines or tumors, the blood vessels are expressing α\nv\nβ\n3\n. However, following active neovascularization, once the vessels have stopped developing, the expression of α\nv\nβ\n3\n diminishes to levels not detectable by immunofluorescence analysis. This regulation of α\nv\nβ\n3\n expression in blood vessels undergoing angiogenesis as contrasted to the lack of expression in mature vessels provides for the unique ability of this invention to control and inhibit angiogenesis as shown in the following Examples using the CAM angiogenesis assay system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other profiles, the metalloproteinase MMP-2 and α\nv\nβ\n3\n colocalized on endothelial cells undergoing angiogenesis three days following bFGF induction in the 10 day old CAM model. MMP-2 was only minimally expressed on vessels that lacked the α\nv\nβ\n3\n receptor. In addition, MMP-2 colocalized with α\nv\nβ\n3\n on angiogenic M21-L tumor-associated blood vessels in vivo (tumors resulting from injection of M21-L human melanoma cells into the dermis of human skin grafts grown on SCID mice as described in Example 11) but not with preexisting non-tumor associated blood vessels. Similar results of the selective association of MMP-2 and α\nv\nβ\n3\n were also obtained with α\nv\nβ\n3\n bearing CS-1 melanoma tumors in the CAM model but not with CS-1 cells lacking α\nv\nβ\n3\n.\n\n\n \n6. \nCAM Angiogenesis Assay\n \n\n\nA. \nAngiogenesis Induced by Growth Factors\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAngiogenesis has been shown to be induced by cytokines or growth factors as referenced in Example 5A. In the experiments described herein, angiogenesis in the CAM preparation described in Example 5 was induced by growth factors that were topically applied onto the CAM blood vessels as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAngiogenesis was induced by placing a 5 millimeter (mm) \nX\n 5 mm Whatman filter disk (Whatman Filter paper No.1) saturated with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) or HBSS containing 150 nanograms/milliliter (ng/ml) recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) on the CAM of a 10-day chick embryo in a region devoid of blood vessels and the windows were latter sealed with tape. In other assays, 125 ng/ml bFGF was also effective at inducing blood vessel growth. For assays where inhibition of angiogenesis ws evaluated with intravenous injections of antagonists, angiogenesis was first induced with 1-2 ug/ml bFGF in fibroblast growth medium. Angiogenesis was monitored by photomicroscopy after 72 hours. CAMs were snap frozen, and 6 um cryostat sections were fixed with acetone and stained by immunofluorescence as described in Example 5C with 10 ug/ml of either anti-β\n1\n monoclonal antibody CSAT or LM609.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe immunofluorescence photomicrograph in \nFigure 5C\n shows enhanced expression of α\nv\nβ\n3\n during bFGF-induced angiogenesis on the chick CAM in contrast with the absence of α\nv\nβ\n3\n expression in an untreated chick CAM as shown in \nFigure 5B\n. α\nv\nβ\n3\n was readily detectable on many (75% to 80%) of the vessels on the bFGF-treated CAMs. In addition, the expression of integrin β\n1\n did not change from that seen in an untreated CAM as β\n1\n was also readily detectable on stimulated blood vessels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe relative expression of α\nv\nβ\n3\n and β\n1\n integrins was then quantified during bFGF-induced angiogenesis by laser confocal image analysis of the CAM cryostat sections. The stained sections were then analyzed with a Zeiss laser confocal microscope. Twenty-five vessels stained with LM609 and 15 stained with CSAT (average size - 1200 sq mm\n2\n, range 350 to 3,500 mm\n2\n) were selected from random fields and the average rhodamine fluorescence for each vessel per unit area was measured in arbitrary units by laser confocal image analysis. Data are expressed as the mean fluorescence intensity in arbitrary units of vessels ± standard error (SE).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results plotted in \nFigure 6\n show that staining of α\nv\nβ\n3\n was significantly enhanced (four times higher) on CAMs treated with bFGF as determined by the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test (P<0.0001) whereas β\n1\n staining was not significantly different with bFGF treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CAM assay was further used to examine the effect of another potent angiogenesis inducer, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), on the expression of β\n1\n and β\n3\n integrins. Filter disks impregnated with either bFGF or TNFα and placed on CAMs from 10 day embryos were found to promote local angiogenesis after 72 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are shown in the photomicrographs of CAMs either untreated (\nFigure 7A\n), treated with bFGF (\nFigure 7B\n) or treated with TNFα (\nFigure 7C\n). Blood vessels are readily apparent in both the bFGF and TNFα treated preparations but are not present in the untreated CAM. Thus, the topical application of a growth factor/cytokine resulted in the induction of angiogenesis from mature vessels in an adjacent area into the area originally devoid of blood vessels. In view of the bFGF-induced blood vessels and concomitant expression of α\nv\nβ\n3\n as shown in \nFigure 5C\n, treatment of TNFα results in comparable activities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese findings indicate that in both human and chick, blood vessels involved in angiogenesis show enhanced expression of α\nv\nβ\n3\n. Consistent with this, expression of α\nv\nβ\n3\n on cultured endothelial cells can be induced by various cytokines \nin vitro\n as described by \nJanat et al., J. Cell Physiol., 151:588 (1992\n); \nEnenstein et al., Exp. Cell Res., 203:499 (1992\n) and \nSwerlick et al., J. Invest. Derm., 99:715 (1993\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect on growth-factor induced angiogenesis by antibody and peptide inhibitors is presented in Examples 7A and 7B.\n\n\n \nB. \nEmbryonic Angiogenesis\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe CAM preparation for evaluating the effect of angiogenesis inhibitors on the natural formation of embryonic neovasculature was the 6 day embryonic chick embryo as previously described. At this stage in development, the blood vessels are undergoing de novo growth and thus provides a useful system for determining if α\nv\nβ\n3\n participates in embryonic angiogenesis. The CAM system was prepared as described above with the exception that the assay was performed at \nembryonic day\n 6 rather than at \nday\n 10. The effect on embryonic angiogenesis by treatment with antibodies and peptides of this invention are presented in Example 7C.\n\n\n \nC. \nAngiogenesis Induced by Tumors\n \n\n\n \n \n \nTo investigate the role of α\nv\nβ\n3\n in tumor-induced angiogenesis, various α\nv\nβ\n3\n-negative human melanoma and carcinoma fragments were used in the CAM assay that were previously grown and isolated from the CAM of 17-day chick embryo as described by \nBrooks et al., J. Cell Biol., 122:1351 (1993\n) and as described herein. The fragments induced extensive neovascularization in the presence of buffer alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAngiogenesis was induced in the CAM assay system by direct apposition of a tumor fragment on the CAM. Preparation of the chick embryo CAM was identical to the procedure described above. Instead of a filter paper disk, a 50 milligram (mg) to 55 mg in weight fragment of one of human melanoma tumor M21-L, human lung carcinoma tumor UCLAP-3, human pancreatic carcinoma cell line FG (\nCheresh et al., Cell 58:945-953, 1989\n), or human laryngeal carcinoma cell line HEp3, all of which are α\nv\nβ\n3\n negative tumors, was placed on the CAM in an area originally devoid of blood vessels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe M21-L human melanoma cell line, UCLAP-3 human lung carcinoma cell line, FG pancreatic carcinoma cell line, or HEp3 human laryngeal carcinoma cell line, all α\nv\nβ\n3\n negative, were used to grow the solid human tumors on the CAMs of chick embryos. A single cell suspension of 8 x 10\n6\n M21-L, UCLAP-3, and FB or 5 x 10\n5\n HEp3 cells was first applied to the CAMs in a total volume of 30 ul of sterile HBSS. The windows were sealed with tape and the embryos were incubated for 7 days to allow growth of human tumor lesions. At the end of 7 days, now a 17-day embryo, the tumors were resected from the CAMs and trimmed free of surrounding CAM tissue. The tumors were sliced into 50 mg to 55 mg tumor fragments for use in either angiogenesis or tumor growth assays. The tumor fragments were placed on a new set of 10 day chick embryo CAMs as described in Example 6A in an area devoid of blood vessels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumors grown \nin vivo\n on the chick embryo CAMs were stained for α\nv\nβ\n3\n expression with mAb LM609 as described in Example 3A. No specific staining of tumor cells was observed indicating a lack of α\nv\nβ\n3\n expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese CAM tumor preparations were then subsequently treated as described in Examples 7D and 7E for measuring the effects of antibodies and peptides on tumor-induced angiogenesis. The CAM tumor preparations were also treated as described in Examples 8, 9, and 12 for measuring the effects of antibodies and peptides on regression of tumors and apoptosis of angiogenic blood vessels and vascular cells.\n\n\n \n7: \nInhibition of Angiogenesis as Measured in the CAM Assay\n \n\n\nA. \nInhibition of Growth Factor-Induced Angiogenesis by Topical Application of Inhibitors\n \n\n\n1) \nTreatment with Monoclonal Antibodies\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine whether α\nv\nβ\n3\n plays an active role in angiogenesis, filter disks saturated with bFGF or TNFα were placed on CAMs then the monoclonal antibodies (also referred to as mAb), LM609 (specific for α\nv\nβ\n3\n), CSAT (specific for β\n1\n), or P3G2 or also P1F6 (both specific for α\nv\nβ\n5\n) were added to the preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAngiogenesis was induced on CAMs from 10 day chick embryos by filter disks saturated with bFGF. Disks were then treated with 50 ml HBSS containing 25 mg of mAb in a total volume of 25 ul of sterile HBSS at 0, 24, and 48 hours. At 72 hours, CAMs were harvested and placed in a 35 mm petri dish and washed once with 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline. The bottom side of the filter paper and CAM tissue was then analyzed under an Olympus stereo microscope, with two observers in a double-blind fashion. Angiogenesis inhibition was considered significant when CAMs exhibited >50% reduction in blood vessel infiltration of the CAM directly under the disk. Experiments were repeated four times per antibody, with 6 to 7 embryos per condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of the effects of mAb treatment on bFGF-induced angiogenesis is shown in \nFigures 8A-8B\n. An untreated CAM preparation devoid of blood vessels is shown in \nFigure 8A\n to provide a comparison with the bFGF-blood vessel induction shows in \nFigure 8B\n and effects thereon by the mAbs in \nFigures 8C-8E\n. About 75% of these CAMs treated with mAb LM609 exhibited >50% inhibition of angiogenesis as shown in \nFigure 8E\n, and many of these appeared devoid of vessel infiltration. In contrast, the buffer control (\nFigure 8A\n) and disks treated with mAbs CSAT (\nFigure 8C\n) and P3G2 (\nFigure 8D\n) consistently showed extensive vascularization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIdentical results were obtained when angiogenesis was induced with TNFα. To examine the effects of these same antibodies on preexisting mature blood vessels present from normal vessel development adjacent to the areas devoid of vessels, filter disks saturated with mAbs were placed on vascularized regions of CAMs from 10 day embryos that did not receive topical application of cytokine. None of the three mAbs affected preexisting vessels, as assessed by visualization under a stereo microscope. Thus, mAb LM609 selectively inhibited only new blood vessel growth and did not effect mature blood vessels present in adjacent areas. This same effect was seen with the application of synthetic peptides either applied topically or intravenously as described in Examples 7A2) and 7E2), respectively.\n\n\n \n2) \nTreatment with synthetic Peptides\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nCAM assays were also performed with the synthetic peptides of this invention to determine the effect of cyclic and linearized peptides on growth factor induced angiogenesis. The peptides were prepared as described in Example 1 and 80 ug of peptide were presented in a total volume of 25 ul of sterile HBSS. The peptide solution was applied to the CAM preparation immediately and then again at 24 and 48 hrs. At 72 hours the filter paper and surrounding CAM tissue was dissected and viewed as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults from this assay revealed were similar to those shown in \nFigures 9A-9C\n as described in Example 7E2) where synthetic peptides were intravenously injected into tumor induced blood vessels. Here, with the control peptide, 62186, the bFGF-induced blood vessels remained undisturbed as shown in \nFigure 9A\n. In contrast when the cyclic RGD peptide, 62814, was applied to the filter, the formation of blood vessels was inhibited leaving the area devoid of new vasculature. This effect was similar in appearance to that shown in \nFigure 9B\n as described in Example 7E2) below. In addition, also as shown in \nFigure 9C\n for intravenously injected peptides, in areas in which mature blood vessels were present yet distant from the placement of the growth-factor saturated filter, no effect was seen with the topical treatment of synthetic peptides on these outlying vessels. The inhibitory activity of the peptides on angiogenesis thus is limited to the areas of angiogenesis induced by growth factors and does not effect adjacent preexisting mature vessels or result in any deleterious cytotoxicity to the surrounding area.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar assays are performed with the other synthetic peptides prepared in Example 1 and listed in Table 1.\n\n\n \n3) \nTreatment with MMP-2 Peptide Fragments\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nTo demonstrate the biological effects of MMP-2 peptide fragments on angiogenesis, CAM assays were performed as described above with the exception that angiogenesis was induced with filter discs saturated for 10 minutes with bFGF at a concentration of 1.0 ug/ml in HBS. The discs were then positioned on the CAM in an area that was reduced in the number of preexisting vessels. The C-terminal CTMMP-2(410-637) fusion protein, prepared as described above, or control GST receptor associated fusion protein (RAP) (1.5 ug in 30 ul of HBSS) was applied then topically to the filter disc once per day for a total of three days. At the end of the incubation period, the embryos were sacrificed and the filter disc and underlying CAM tissue was resected and analyzed for angiogenesis with a stereo microscope. Angiogenesis was quantified by counting the number of blood vessels branch points that occur within the confines of the filter discs. The branched blood vessels are considered to correspond primarily to new angiogenic sprouting blood vessels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nQuantification was performed in a double blind manner by at least two independent observers. The results are expressed as the Angiogenic Index where the angiogenic index is the number of branch points (bFGF stimulated) minus the number of branch points (control unstimulated) per filter disc. Experiments routinely had 6-10 embryos per condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of the CAM angiogenesis assay are shown in \nFigures 25A-D\n, \n26 and 27\n. In \nFigure 25\n, a series of photographs divided into four figures, \nFigures 25A-D\n, illustrate the comparison of angiogenesis inhibited in the presence of the CTMMP-2 fusion protein (CTMMP-2(410-637) (\nFigures 25C-D\n) and not inhibited in the presence of control GST fusion protein (\nFigures 25A-B\n). \nFigures 26 and 27\n are bar graphs illustrating the angiogenesis index of CAM angiogenesis assays with CTMMP-2, the same fusion protein as above, compared to controls (bFGF only or GST-RAP fusion protein). In \nFigure 27\n, the results of two separate experiments (#1 & #2) using CTMMP-2(410-637) fusion protein are shown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese results demonstrated in all three figures indicate that a CTMMP-2 fusion protein or polypeptide containing a C-terminal domain of MMP-2 is a useful composition for inhibition of bFGF-mediated angiogenesis by inhibiting α\nv\nβ\n3\n.\n\n\n \nB. \nInhibition of Growth Factor-Induced Angiogenesis by Intravenous Application of Inhibitors\n \n\n\n1) \nTreatment with Monoclonal Antibodies\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect on growth factor-induced angiogenesis with monoclonal antibodies intravenously injected into the CAM preparation was also evaluated for use in this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparation of the chick embryo CAMs for intravenous injections were essentially as described in Example 7A with some modifications. During the candling procedures prominent blood vessels were selected and marks were made on the egg shell to indicate their positions. The holes were drilled in the shell and the CAMs were dropped and bFGF saturated filter papers were placed on the CAMs as described above. The windows were sealed with sterile tape and the embryos were replaced in the incubator. Twenty four hours later, a second small window was carefully cut on the lateral side of the egg shell directly over prominent blood vessels selected previously. The outer egg shell was carefully removed leaving the embryonic membranes intact. The shell membrane was made transparent with a small drop of mineral oil (Perkin-Elmer Corp, Norwalk, CT) which allowed the blood vessels to be visualized easily. Purified sterile mAbs, or synthetic peptides, the latter of which are described below, were inoculated directly into the blood vessels once with a 30 gauge needle at a dose of 200 ug of IgG per embryo in a total volume of 100 ul of sterile PBS. The windows were sealed with tape and the embryos were allowed to incubate until 72 hours. The filter disks and surrounding CAM tissues were analyzed as described before.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine the localization of LM609 mAb in CAM tissues or in tumor tissues, as shown herein and in the following Examples, that were previously inoculated intravenously with LM609, the fixed sections were blocked with 2.5% BSA in HBSS for 1 hour at room temperature followed by staining with a 1:250 dilution of goat anti-mouse rhodamine labeled secondary antibody (Tago). The sections were then analyzed with a Zeiss immunofluorescence compound microscope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of intravenous antibody treatment to the bFGF induced blood vessel CAM preparation are shown in \nFigures 10A-10C\n. In \nFigure 10A\n, angiogenesis induced as a result of bFGF treatment is shown. No change to the presence of bFGF induced vasculature was seen with intravenous exposure to mAb P3G2, an anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n antibody, as shown in \nFigure 10B\n. In contrast, treatment of the bFGF induced angiogenesis CAM preparation with LM609, an anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n antibody, resulted in the complete inhibition of growth of new vessels into the filter area as shown in \nFigure 10C\n. The inhibitory effect on angiogenesis is thus resulting from the inhibition of α\nv\nβ\n3\n receptor activity by the LM609 anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n-specific antibody. Since the blocking of the α\nv\nβ\n5\n does not inhibit the formation of neovasculature into the CAMs filter site, α\nv\nβ\n5\n thus is not essential as compared to α\nv\nβ\n3\n for growth of new vessels.\n\n\n \n2) \nTreatment with Synthetic Peptides\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nFor CAM preparations in which angiogenesis was induced with 1-2 ug/ml bFGF as previously described, synthetic peptides 69601 (control) and 66203 (SEQ ID NO 5) were separately intravenously injected into \nCAM preparations\n 18 hours after bFGF induction of angiogenesis. The preparations were maintained for an additional 36-40 hours after which time the number of branch points were determined as previously described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are shown in \nFigure 28\n where \npeptide\n 66203 completely inhibited bFGF-induced angiogenesis in contrast to the absence of inhibition with the control peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other assays, peptide 85189 (SEQ ID NO 15) was evaluated for inhibiting bFGF-induced angiogenesis in the CAM assay over a dosage range of 10 ug/embryo to 300 ug/embryo. The assay was performed as previously described. The results are shown in \nFigure 29\n where the lowest effective dose was 30 ug with 100 and 300 ug nearly completely inhibiting angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn still further assays, \npeptide\n 85189 was compared to \n \npeptides\n \n 69601 and 66203 for anti-angiogenesis activity. The assay was performed as described above with the exception that 50 ug peptide were used. The results, plotted in \nFigure 30\n, showed that peptides 66203 (labeled 203) and 85189 (labeled 189) were effective inhibitors of bFGF-mediated angiogenesis compared to bFGF-treated (labeled bFGF) and 69601-treated (labeled 601) controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effectiveness of the different salt formulations of \npeptide\n 85189 was also evaluated in similar bFGF-induced CAM assays. The peptides were used at 100 ug/embryo. The same peptide sequence in HCl (peptide 85189) and in TFA (peptide 121974) inhibited bFGF-induced angiogenesis with the HCl formulated peptide being slightly more effective than that in TFA (the respective number of branch points for \npeptide\n 85189 versus 121974 is 30 versus 60). Untreated CAMs, labeled as \"no cytokine\" had approximately half as many branch points as that seen with bFGF treatment, respectively 70 versus 190. Treatment with \ncontrol peptide\n 69601 had no effect on inhibiting angiogenesis (230 branch points).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe other synthetic peptides prepared in Example 1 are separately intravenously injected into the growth factor induced blood vessels in the CAM preparation as described above. The effect of the peptides on the viability of the vessels is similarly assessed.\n\n\n \n3) \nTreatment with MMP-2 Fragment\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nWith the above-described protocol, the effect of MMP-2 fusion proteins, CTMMP-2(2-4), also referred to as CTMMP-2(445-637) and CTMMP-2(10-1), also referred to as CTMMP-2(274-637) was also evaluated. The assay was performed as previously described with the exception that 50 ug of fusion protein was administered to the bFGF-treated embryos. The effect of fusion protein treatment was assessed at 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are shown for these selected time periods in \nFigures 31A-L\n where angiogenesis was photographically assessed under assay conditions of no treatment, bFGF treatment, bFGF treatment followed by CTMMP-2(2-4), labeled as bFGF + MAID (MAID = MMP-2 angiogenesis inhibiting domain), and bFGF treatment followed by CTMMP-2(10-1), labeled as bFGF + Control. The significant induction of angiogenesis after 48 and 72 hours following bFGF treatment was almost completely inhibited only with exposure to CTMMP-2(2-4). The extent of inhibition with CTMMP-2(2-4) was greater than that seen with CTMMP-2(10-1) which exhibited some \nin vivo\n anti-angiogenesis activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe other MMP-2 compositions, whole MMP-2, fragments and fusion proteins, prepared as previously described are also separately intravenously injected into the growth factor induced blood vessels in the CAM preparation as described above. The effect of the peptides on the viability of the vessels is similarly assessed.\n\n\n \nC. \nInhibition of Embryonic Angiogenesis by Topical Application\n \n\n\n1) \nTreatment with Monoclonal Antibodies\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine whether α\nv\nβ\n3\n participates in embryonic angiogenesis, the effect of LM609 on de novo growth of blood vessels on CAMs was examined in 6 day embryos, a stage marked by active neovascularization as described in Example 5A. The CAM assay was prepared as described in Example 6C with the subsequent topical application of disks saturated with mAbs placed on CAMs of 6 day old embryos in the absence of cytokines. After 3 days, CAMS were resected and photographed. Each experiment included 6 embryos per group and was repeated 2 times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody LM609 (\nFigure 11C\n), but not CSAT (\nFigure 11A\n) or P3G2 (\nFigure 11B\n), prevented vascular growth under these conditions; this indicates that α\nv\nβ\n3\n plays a substantial role in embryonic neovascularization that was independent of added growth factors for induction of angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n2) \nTreatment with Synthetic Peptides\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe synthetic peptides prepared in Example 1 are separately added to the embryonic CAM preparation prepared above and as described in Example 5A2) by either topical application to the CAM or intravenous application to blood vessels. The effect of the peptides on the viability of the vessels is similarly assessed.\n\n\n \nD. \nInhibition of Tumor-Induced Angiogenesis by Topical Application\n \n\n\n1) \nTreatment with Monoclonal_ Antibodies\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nIn addition to the angiogenesis assays described above where the effects of anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists, LM609 and various peptides, on embryonic angiogenesis were evaluated, the role of α\nv\nβ\n3\n in tumor-induced angiogenesis was also investigated. As an inducer, α\nv\nβ\n3\n-negative human M21-L melanoma fragments previously grown and isolated from the CAM of a 17-day chick embryo were used. The fragments were prepared as described in Example 6C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above in Example 7A1), mAbs were separately topically applied to the tumor fragments at a concentration of 25 ug in 25 ul of HBSS and the windows were then sealed with tape. The mAbs were added again in the same fashion at 24 hours and 48 hours. At 72 hours, the tumors and surrounding CAM tissues were analyzed as described above in Example 7A1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described in Example 6C, tumors were initially derived by transplanting cultured M21-L cells, which do not to express integrin α\nv\nβ\n3\n as described by Felding-Habermann et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest.\n, 89:2018 (1992) onto the CAMs of 10-day old chick embryos. These α\nv\nβ\n3\n-negative fragments induced extensive neovascularization in the presence of buffer alone, or mAbs CSAT (anti-β\n1\n) or P3G2 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n). In contrast, mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) abolished the infiltration of most vessels into the tumor mass and surrounding CAM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to quantitate the effect of the mAbs on the tumor-induced angiogenesis, blood vessels entering the tumor within the focal plane of the CAM were counted under a stereo microscope by two observers in a double-blind fashion. Each data bar presented in \nFigure 12\n represents the mean number of vessels ± SE from 12 CAMs in each group representing duplicate experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis quantitative analysis revealed a three-fold reduction in the number of vessels entering tumors treated with mAb LM609 compared to tumors treated with buffer or the other mAbs, P3G2 or CSAT (P< 0.0001) as determined by Wilcoxon Rank.Sum Test. The fact that M21-L tumors do not express α\nv\nβ\n3\n indicates that mAb LM609 inhibits angiogenesis by directly affecting blood vessels rather than the tumor cells. These results correspond with the histological distribution of α\nv\nβ\n3\n in cancer tissue biopsies shown in \nFigure 3A-3D\n where the distribution of α\nv\nβ\n3\n was limited to the blood vessels in the tumor and not to the tumor cells themselves.\n\n\n \n2) \nTreatment with synthetic Peptides\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe synthetic peptides prepared in Example 1, including MMP-2-derived peptides and fusion proteins are topically applied to the tumor-induced angiogenic CAM assay system as described above. The effect of the peptides on the viability of the vessels is similarly assessed.\n\n\n \nE. \nInhibition of Tumor-Induced Angiogenesis by Intravenous Application\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n1) \nTreatment with Monoclonal Antibodies\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nTumor-induced blood vessels prepared as described in Example 7E1) were also treated with mAbs applied by intravenous injection. Tumors were placed on the CAMs as described in Example 7D1) and the windows sealed with tape and 24 hours latter, 200 ug of purified mAbs were inoculated once intravenously in chick embryo blood vessels as described previously. The chick embryos were then allowed to incubate for 7 days. The extent of angiogenesis was then observed as described in above. As described in Example 8 below, after this time period, the tumors were resected and analyzed by their weight to determine the effect of antibody exposure on tumor growth or suppression.\n\n\n \n2) \nTreatment with Synthetic Peptides\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effects of peptide exposure to tumor-induced vasculature in the CAM assay system was also assessed. The tumor-CAM preparation was used as described above with the exception that instead of intravenous injection of a mAb, synthetic peptides prepared as described in Example 1 and Example 7A2) were separately intravenously injected into visible blood vessels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of CAM assays with the cyclic peptide, 66203 containing the HCl salt, and control peptide, 62186, are shown in \nFigures 9A-9C\n. In \nFigure 9A\n, the treatment with the control peptide did not effect the abundant large blood vessels that were induced by the tumor treatment to grow into an area originally devoid of blood vessels of the CAM. In contrast when the cyclic RGD peptide, 66203, an antagonist to α\nv\nβ\n3\n, was applied to the filter, the formation of blood vessels was inhibited leaving the area devoid of new vasculature as shown in \nFigure 9B\n. The inhibitory effect of the RGD-containing peptide was specific and localized as evidenced by an absence of any deleterious effects to vessels located adjacent to the tumor placement. Thus, in \nFigure 9C\n, when inhibitory peptides are intravenously injected into the CAM assay system, no effect was seen on the preexisting mature vessels present in the CAM in areas adjacent yet distant from the placement of the tumor. The preexisting vessels in this location were not affected by the inhibitory peptide that flowed within those vessels although the generation of new vessels from these preexisting vessels into the tumor mass was inhibited. Thus, synthetic peptides including 66203 and 62184, previously shown in ligand-receptor assays in Example 4 to be antagonists of α\nv\nβ\n3\n, have now been demonstrated to inhibit angiogenesis that is limited to vessels undergoing development and not to mature preexisting vessels. In addition, the intravenous infusion of peptides does not result in any deleterious cytotoxicity to the surrounding area as evidence by the intact vasculature in \nFigure 9C\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar assays are performed with the other synthetic peptides prepared in Example 1 and listed in Table 1 along with the MMP-2 compositions of this invention.\n\n\n \n3) \nTreatment with MMP-2 Fragments\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nA CS-1 tumor (β\n3\n-negative) was prepared in a CAM as described above. After 24 hours of tumor growth, a composition of MMP-2 fragment, designated CTMMP-2(2-4) and prepared as described in Example 4A, was administered intraveneously at 50 ug fragment in 100 ul of PBS. After 6 days, the tumor was evaluated for mass. Tumors treated with CTMMP-2(2-4) were reduced in growth rate by about 50% when compared to the growth rate of control tumors treated with CTMMP-2(10-1) or with PBS control. Thus, the α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist inhibited tumor growth.\n\n\n \n8. \nInhibition of Tumor Tissue Growth With α\n \n \nv\n \n \nβ\n \n \n3\n \n \nAntagonists As Measured in the CAM Assay\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nAs described in Example 7E1), in addition to visually assessing the effect of anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists on growth factor or tumor induced angiogenesis, the effect of the antagonists was also assessed by measuring any changes to the tumor mass following exposure. For this analysis, the tumor-induced angiogenesis CAM assay system was prepared as described in Example 6C and 7D. At the end of the 7 day incubation period, the resulting tumors were resected from the CAMs and trimmed free of any residual CAM tissue, washed with 1 ml of phosphate buffer saline and wet weights were determined for each tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, preparation of the tumor for microscopic histological analysis included fixing representative examples of tumors in Bulins Fixative for 8 hours and embedding in paraffin. Serial sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for microscopic analysis. \nGladson, et al., J. Clin. Invest., 88:1924 (1991\n). Sections were photographed with an Olympus compound microscope at 250x.\n\n\n \nA. \nTopical Application\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe results of typical human melanoma tumor (M21L) weights resulting from topical application of control buffer (HBSS), P3G2 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n5\n) or LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) are listed in Table 4. A number of embryos were evaluated for each treatment with the average tumor weight in milligrams (mg) from each being calculated along with the SE of the mean as shown at the bottom of the table.\n\n \nTable 4\n \n \n \nEmbryo No.\n \nmAb Treatment\n \nTumor Weight (mg)\n \n \n \n \n1\n \nHBSS\n \n108\n \n \n \n2\n \n \n \n152\n \n \n \n3\n \n \n \n216\n \n \n \n4\n \n \n \n270\n \n \n \n5\n \n \n \n109\n \n \n \n6\n \n \n \n174\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \nP3G2\n \n134\n \n \n \n2\n \n \n \n144\n \n \n \n3\n \n \n \n408\n \n \n \n4\n \n \n \n157\n \n \n \n5\n \n \n \n198\n \n \n \n6\n \n \n \n102\n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n124\n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \n99\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \nLM609\n \n24\n \n \n \n2\n \n \n \n135\n \n \n \n3\n \n \n \n17\n \n \n \n4\n \n \n \n27\n \n \n \n5\n \n \n \n35\n \n \n \n6\n \n \n \n68\n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n48\n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \n59\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nmAb Treatment\n \nAverage Tumor Weight (mg)\n \n \n \n \nHBSS control\n \n172 ± 26\n \n \n \nP3G2\n \n171 ± 36\n \n \n \nLM609\n \n52 ± 13\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nExposure of a α\nv\nβ\n3\n-negative human melanoma tumor mass in the CAM assay system to LM609 caused the decrease of the untreated average tumor weight of 172 mg ± 26 to 52 mg ± 13. The P3G2 antibody had no effect on the tumor mass. Thus, the blocking of the α\nv\nβ\n3\n receptor by the topical application of α\nv\nβ\n3\n-specific LM609 antibody resulted in a regression of tumor mass along with an inhibition of angiogenesis as shown in the preceding Examples. The measured diameter of the tumor mass resulting from exposure to P3G2 was approximately 8 millimeters to 1 centimeter on average. In contrast, the LM609-treated tumors were on average 2 to 3 millimeters in diameter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrozen sections of these tumors revealed an intact tumor cytoarchitecture for the tumor exposed to P3G2 in contrast to a lack or organized cellular structure in the tumor exposed to LM609. α\nv\nβ\n3\n receptor activity is therefore essential for an α\nv\nβ\n3\n negative tumor to maintain its mass nourished by development of α\nv\nβ\n3\n-expressing neovasculature. The blocking of α\nv\nβ\n3\n with the α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists of this invention results in the inhibition of angiogenesis into the tumor ultimately resulting in the diminution of tumor mass.\n\n\n \nB. \nIntravenous Application\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe results of typical carcinoma tumor (UCLAP-3) weights resulting from intravenous application of control buffer (PBS, phosphate buffered saline), CSAT (anti-β\n1\n) or LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) are listed in Table 5.

The CSAT antibody did not significantly effect the weight of the tumor mass. Thus, the blocking of the α\nv\nβ\n3\n receptor by the intravenous application of α\nv\nβ\n3\n-specific LM609 antibody resulted in a regression of a carcinoma as it did for the melanoma tumor mass above along with an inhibition of angiogenesis as shown in the preceding Examples. In addition, human melanoma tumor growth was similarly inhibited by intravenous injection of LM609.\n\n\n \n9. \nRegression of Tumor Tissue Growth With α\n \n \nv\n \n \nβ\n \n \n3\n \n \nAntagonists As Measured in the CAM Assay\n \n\n\n \n \n \nTo further assess the effects of α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists on tumor growth and survival, fragments of human melanoma and fragments of carcinomas of the lung, pancreas, and larynx were placed on CAMS of 10-day old embryos as described in Example 5A.\n\n\n \nA. \nIntravenous Application\n \n\n\n1) \nTreatment with Monoclonal Antibodies\n \n\n\na. \nTreatment with LM609 (Anti-α\n \n \nv\n \n \nβ\n \n \n3\n \n \n) and CSAT (Anti-β\n \n \n1\n \n \n)\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nTwenty four hours after implantation of CAM with carcinoma fragments of α\nv\nβ\n3\n-negative human melanoma M21-L, pancreatic carcinoma FG, human lung carcinoma UCLAP-3, or human laryngeal carcinoma HEp3, embryos were injected intravenously with PBS alone or a single dose (300 ug/100 ul) of either mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) or CSAT (anti-β\n3\n). Tumors were allowed to propagate for six additional days. At the end of the incubation period the tumors were carefully resected and trimmed free of surrounding CAM tissue. Tumor resections were performed by two independent investigators removing only the easily definable solid tumor mass. The tumors had well defined margins, thus the thin semi-transparent membrane (CAM) which is readily distinguishable from the solid tumor mass was removed without disturbing the tumor mass itself. The resected tumors were weighed and examined morphologically and histologically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFigure 13\n, wet tumor weights at the end of 7 days were determined and compared to initial tumor weights before treatments. Each bar represents the mean ± S.E. of 5-10 tumors per group. mAb LM609 inhibited tumor growth significantly (p <0.001) as compared to controls in all tumors tested. Tumors treated with PBS or CSAT proliferated in all cases. In contrast, mAb LM609 not only prevented the growth of these tumors but induced extensive regression in most cases. Importantly, these tumor cells do not express integrin α\nv\nβ\n3\n demonstrating that the inhibition of growth was due to the anti-angiogenic effects of this antibody on neovasculature rather than upon the tumor cells directly.\n\n\n \nb. \nTreatment with LM609 (Anti-α\n \n \nv\n \n \nβ\n \n \n3\n \n \n) and P3G2 (Anti-α\n \n \nv\n \n \nβ\n \n \n5\n \n \n)\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman M21-L melanoma tumor fragments (50 mg) were implanted on the CAMs of 10 day old embryos as described in Example 5A. Twenty four hours later, embryos were injected intravenously with PBS alone or a single dose (300 ug/100 ul) of either mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) or P3G2 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n5\n). Tumors were allowed to propagate as described in Example 9A1)a above and were examined morphologically and histologically as herein described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative examples of M21-L tumors treated with mAbs P3G2 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n5\n) or LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) were examined morphologically. The P3G2-treated tumors were large (8 mm in diameter) and well vascularized whereas those treated with mAb LM609 were much smaller (3 mm in diameter) and lacked detectable blood vessels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tumors were further examined by the preparation of histological sections and staining with hematoxylin and eosin as described in Example 9A1)a. As shown in \nFigure 14\n (upper panel), tumors treated with mAb P3G2 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n5\n) showed numerous viable and actively dividing tumor cells as indicated by mitotic figures (arrowheads) as well as by multiple blood vessels (arrows) throughout the tumor stroma. In contrast, few if any viable tumor cells or blood vessels were detected in tumors treated with mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) (\nFigure 14\n, lower panel). These results demonstrate that antagonists of integrin α\nv\nβ\n3\n inhibit tumor-induced angiogenesis leading to the growth arrest and regression of a variety of human tumors \nin vivo\n. It is important to point out that embryos examined after seven days of tumor growth (embryonic day 17) appeared normal upon gross examination whether or not they were treated with an α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist. These findings indicate that antagonists of this integrin appear non-toxic to the developing embryos.\n\n\n \n2) \nTreatment With Synthetic Peptides\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman M21-L melanoma tumor fragments (50 mg) were implanted on the CAMs of 10 day oldembryos as described in Example 5A. Twenty four hours later, embryos received a single intravenous injection of 300 ug/100 ul of either the cyclo-RADfV (69601) and or cyclo-RGDfV (66203). After a total of 72 hours, tumors were removed, examined morphologically, and photographed with a stereo microscope as described in Example 9A1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe panels shown in \nFigures 15A through 15E\n correspond as follows: \nFigure 15A\n, duplicate samples treated with cyclo-RADfV peptide (69601); \nFigure 15B\n, duplicate samples treated with cyclo-RGDfV peptide (66203); \nFigure 15C\n, adjacent CAM tissue taken from the same embryos treated with cyclo-RGDfV peptide (66203) and \nFigures 15D and 15E\n, high magnification (13x) of peptide treated tumors. \nFigure 15D\n depicts normal blood vessels from control peptide (69601) treated tumor. \nFigure 15E\n depicts examples of disrupted blood vessels from cyclo-RGDfV peptide (66203) treated tumors (arrows).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results illustrate that \nonly peptide\n 66203 in contrast to control \npeptide\n 69601 inhibited vessel formation, and further that vessels in the CAM tissue adjacent to the tumor were not affected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional tumor regression assays were performed with the α\nv\nβ\n3\n-reactive peptide 85189 (SEQ ID NO 15) against 69601 as a control. The assays were performed as described above with the exception that 100 ug of peptide was intravenously injected into the CAM at 18 hourst postimplantation. After 48 hours more, the tumors were then resected and wet weights were obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigures 32, 33\n and \n34\n respectively show the reduction in tumor weight for UCLAP-3, M21-L and FgM tumors following intravenous exposure to \npeptide\n 85189 in contrast to the lack of effect with either PBS or \npeptide\n 69601.\n\n\n \n10. \nRegression of Tumor Tissue Growth With α\n \n \nv\n \n \nβ\n \n \n3\n \n \nAntagonists as Measured by In Vivo Rabbit Eye Model Assay\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists on growth factor-induced angiogenesis can be observed in naturally transparent structures as exemplified by the cornea of the eye. New blood vessels grow from the rim of the cornea, which has a rich blood supply, toward the center of the cornea, which normally does not have a blood supply. Stimulators of angiogenesis, such as bFGF, when applied to the cornea induce the growth of new blood vessels from the rim of the cornea. Antagonists of angiogenesis, applied to the cornea, inhibit the growth of new blood vessels from the rim of the cornea. Thus, the cornea undergoes angiogenesis through an invasion of endothelial cells from the rim of the cornea into the tough collagen-packed corneal tissue which is easily visible. The rabbit eye model assay therefore provides an \nin vivo\n model for the direct observation of stimulation and inhibition of angiogenesis following the implantation of compounds directly into the cornea of the eye.\n\n\n \nA. \nIn Vivo Rabbit Eye Model Assay\n \n\n\n1) \nAngiogenesis Induced by Growth Factors\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAngiogenesis was induced in the \nin vivo\n rabbit eye model assay with the growth factor bFGF and is described in the following sections.\n\n\n \na. \nPreparation of Hydron Pellets Containing\n \n\n\n\n\nGrowth Factor and Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHydron polymer pellets containing growth factor and mAbs were prepared as described by \nD'Amato, et al., Proc. Natl. Acid. Sci., USA, 91:4082-4085 (1994\n). The individual pellets contained 650 ng of the growth factor bFGF bound to sucralfate (Carafet, Marion Merrell Dow Corporation) to stabilize the bFGF and ensure its slow release into the surrounding tissue. In addition, hydron pellets were prepared which contained either 40 ug of the mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) or mAb P1F6 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n5\n) in PBS. The pellets were cast in specially prepared Teflon pegs that have a 2.5 mm core drilled into their surfaces. Approximately 12 ul of casting material was placed into each peg and polymerized overnight in a sterile hood. Pellets were then sterilized by ultraviolet irradiation.\n\n\n \nb. \nTreatment with Monoclonal Antibodies\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nEach experiment consisted of three rabbits in which one eye received a pellet comprising bFGF and LM609 and the other eye received a pellet comprising bFGF and a mouse mAb P1F6 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n5\n). The use of paired eye testing to compare LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) to other mAb and PBS controls provides a means for rigorous testing to demonstrate significant differences between the mAbs tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe P1F6 mAb immunoreacts with the integrin α\nv\nβ\n5\n which is found on the surface of vascular endothelial cells but is presumably not involved in angiogenesis. To determine whether the mAb P1F6 was involved in angiogenesis, pellets containing only this mAb were prepared and assayed as described below to confirm that the mAb did not induce angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll of the mAbs tested were purified from ascites fluid using Protein-A Sepharose CL-4B affinity column chromatography according to well-known methods. The eluted immunoglobulin was then dialyzed against PBS and treated with Detoxi-gel (Pierce Chemicals) to remove endotoxin. Endotoxin has been shown to be a potent angiogenic and inflammatory stimulant. mAbs were therefore tested for the presence of endotoxin with the Chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Assay (Bio-Whittaker) and only those mAbs without detectable endotoxin were used in the rabbit eye model assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA hydron pellet comprising bFGF and mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) or P1F6 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n5\n) was inserted into a corneal pocket formed in the eye of rabbits. The hydron pellet also contained sucralfate to stabilize the bFGF during the assay. Individual pellets were implanted into surgically created \"pockets\" formed in the mid-stroma of the cornea of rabbits. The surgical procedure was done under sterile technique using a Wild model M691 operating microscope equipped with a beamsplitter to which was mounted a camera for photographically recording individual corneas. A 3 mm by 5 mm \"pocket\" was created in the corneal stroma by making a 3 mm incision to half the corneal thickness with a 69 Beaver blade. The stroma was dissected peripherally using an iris spatula and the pellet was implanted with its \nperipheral margin\n 2 mm from the limbus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring the following 14 days, bFGF and mAb diffused from the implanted pellet into the surrounding tissue and thereby effected angiogenesis from the rim of the cornea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative results of each treatment are depicted in \nFigures 16A through 16E\n. The amount of vessels present are quantitated and described in terms of clock hours which are defined as follows. The eye is divided into 12 equal sections in the same manner as a clock is divided into hours. \"One clock hour of vessels\" refers to that amount of vessels which fills an area of the eye equivalent to one hour on a clock. The five rabbits which received only bFGF exhibited florid angiogenesis in which new blood vessels had grown from the rim of the cornea toward the center of the cornea, which normally does not have blood vessels. One of these rabbits had only 1 clock hour of vessels to the pellet. Two of the rabbits which received both bFGF and mAb LM609 had absolutely no detectable angiogenesis up to 14 days following surgery. One of these rabbits had 3 foci of hemorrhagic and budding vessels by \nday\n 14. Two of the rabbits which received bFGF and mAb P3G2 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n5\n) showed extensive vascularization in which new blood vessels had grown from the rim of the cornea into the cornea. One of these rabbits had only 1 to 2 hours of vessels to the pellet.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs evidenced in the rabbit eye model assay, no angiogenic effect was observed on normal paralimbal vessels in the presence of the growth factor bFGF in rabbits which received mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n). In contrast, angiogenesis was observed on paralimbal vessels in the presence of the growth factor bFGF in rabbits which received the mAb P3G2 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n5\n). The complete inhibition of corneal angiogenesis by mAb LM609 is substantially greater than any previously reported anti-angiogenic reagent.\n\n\n \nc. \nTreatment with Polypeptides\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nEach experiment consisted of eight rabbits in which one eye received a pellet comprising 100 nanograms (ng) bFGF and the other eye received a pellet comprising 1 microgram (ug) VEGF. The pellets were inserted into the corneal pocket as described above, and the cytokines subsequently stimulated the growth of new blood vessels into the cornea. Peptides were administered subcutaneously (s.q.) in 1 ml PBS at an initial dosage of 50 ug per kg rabbit the day of pellet insertion, and daily s.q. dosages were given at 20 ug/kg thereafter. After 7 days, the cornea were evaluated as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRabbits receiving \ncontrol peptide\n 69601 showed substantial corneal blood vessel growth at 7 days, in both vFGF and VEGF stimulated eyes. \nRabbits receiving peptide\n 85189 showed less than 50% of the amount of corneal blood vessel growth compared to controls in vFGF-stimulated eyes and nearly 100% inhibition in VEGF-stimulated eyes.\n\n\n \n11. \nIn Vivo Regression of Tumor Tissue Growth With α\n \n \nv\n \n \nβ\n \n \n3\n \n \n\n\n\n\nAntagonists As Measured by Chimeric Mouse:Human Assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAn \nin vivo\n chimeric mouse:human model was generated by replacing a portion of skin from a SCID mouse with human neonatal foreskin (\nFigure 17\n). After the skin graft was established, the human foreskin was inoculated with carcinoma cells. After a measurable tumor was established, either mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) or PBS was injected into the mouse tail vein. Following a 2-3 week period, the tumor was excised and analyzed by weight and histology.\n\n\n \nA. \nIn Vivo Chimeric Mouse:Human Assay\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe \nin vivo\n chimeric mouse:human model is prepared essentially as described in \nYan, et al., J. Clin. Invest., 91:986-996 (1993\n). Briefly, a 2 cm\n2\n square area of skin was surgically removed from a SCID mouse (6-8 weeks of age) and replaced with a human foreskin. The mouse was anesthetized and the hair removed from a 5 cm\n2\n area on each side of the lateral abdominal region by shaving. Two circular graft beds of 2 cm\n2\n were prepared by removing the full thickness of skin down to the fascia. Full thickness human skin grafts of the same size derived from human neonatal foreskin were placed onto the wound beds and sutured into place. The graft was covered with a Band-Aid which was sutured to the skin. Micropore cloth tape was also applied to cover the wound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe M21-L human melanoma cell line or MDA 23.1 breast carcinoma cell line (ATCC HTB 26; α\nv\nβ\n3\n negative by immunoreactivity of tissue sections with mAb LM609), were used to form the solid human tumors on the human skin grafts on the SCID mice. A single cell suspension of 5 x 10\n6\n M21-L or MDA 23.1 cells was injected intradermally into the human skin graft. The mice were then observed for 2 to 4 weeks to allow growth of measurable human tumors.\n\n\n \nB. \nIntravenous Application\n \n\n\n1) \nTreatment With Monoclonal Antibodies\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nFollowing the growth of measurable tumors, SCID mice, which had been injected with M21L tumor cells, were injected intravenously into the tail vein with 250 µg of either the mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) or PBS twice a week for 2 to 3 weeks. After this time, the tumors were resected from the skin and trimmed free of surrounding tissue. Several mice were evaluated for each treatment with the average tumor weight from each treatment being calculated and shown at the bottom of Table 6.\n\n \nTable 6\n \n \n \nM21L Tumor Number\n \nTreatment\n \nTumor Weight (mg)\n \n \n \n \n1\n \nPBS\n \n158\n \n \n \n2\n \n \n \n192\n \n \n \n3\n \n \n \n216\n \n \n \n4\n \n \n \n227\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5\n \nLM609\n \n195\n \n \n \n6\n \n \n \n42\n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n82\n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \n48\n \n \n \n9\n \n \n \n37\n \n \n \n10\n \n \n \n100\n \n \n \n11\n \n \n \n172\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTreatment\n \nAverage Tumor Weight (mg)\n \n \n \n \nPBS\n \n198\n \n \n \nLM609\n \n113\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nExposure of the M21L α\nv\nβ\n3\n-negative human carcinoma tumor mass in the mouse:human chimeric assay system to LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) caused the decrease from the PBS treated average tumor weight of 198 mg to 113 mg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative examples of M21L tumors treated with the mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) and PBS were examined morphologically. The PBS-treated tumors were large (8 to 10 mm in diameter) and well vascularized whereas those treated with mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) were much smaller (3 to 4 mm in diameter) and lacked detectable blood vessels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other experiments with M21-L melanoma tumor cells in the mouse:human chimeric assay system, the response with mAB LM609 was compared with the response obtained with the synthetic peptide 85189 (SEQ ID NO 15) as compared to control synthetic peptide 69601 (SEQ ID NO 6). The assays were performed as described above. The results, shown in \nFigure 35\n, demonstrate that the \nsynthetic peptide\n 85189 reduced tumor volume to below 25 mm\n3\n as compared to control peptide where the tumor volume was approximately 360 mm\n3\n. The mAB LM609 also significantly reduced tumor volume to approximately 60 mm\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumors formed in skin grafts which had been injected with MDA 23.1 cells were detectable and measurable. Morphological examination of the established tumors revealed that neovascularization from the grafted human tissue into the MDA 23.1 tumor cells had occurred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, blocking of the α\nv\nβ\n3\n receptor by the intravenous application of α\nv\nβ\n3\n-specific LM609 antibody and peptides resulted in a regression of a carcinoma in this model system in the same manner as the CAM and rabbit eye model systems as described in Examples 9 and 10, respectively.\n\n\n \n2) \nTreatment with Synthetic Peptides\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a procedure similar to that described above for monoclonal antibodies, peptide antagonists of α\nv\nβ\n3\n were injected intravenously into the tail vein of SCID mice having measurable M21-L tumors. In a preliminary analysis, a dose response curve was performed for peptides 69601 (control) and 85189 (test) injected over a concentration range of 10 to 250 ug/ml. The mean volume and weight of resected tumors following treatment were determined with the results respectively shown in \nFigures 36A and 36B\n. \nPeptide\n 85189 was effective at inhibiting M21-L tumor growth over the concentration range tested compared to treatment with control peptide with the most effective dosage being 250 ug/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor analyzing \npeptide\n 85189 treatment effectiveness over a time course, two treatment regimens were evaluated in the same SCID tumor model. In one assay, treatment with either \n \npeptide\n \n 85189 or 69601 was initiated on \nday\n 6, with \nday\n 0 being the day of M21-L tumor injection of 3 \nX\n 10\n6\n cells subcutaneously into mouse skin, with intraperitoneal injections of 250 ug/\nml peptide\n 85189 or \ncontrol\n 69601 every other day until day 29. The other assay was identically performed with the exception that treatment was initiated on \nday\n 20. At the end of the assays, the tumors were resected and the mean tumor volume in mm\n3\n was determined. The data was plotted as this value +/- the standard error of the mean.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of these assays, respectively shown in \nFigures 37A and 37B\n, indicate that \npeptide\n 85189 but not 69601 inhibited tumor growth at various days after treatment was initiated, depending on the particular treatment regimen. Thus, \npeptide\n 85189 is an effective α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist of both angiogenesis and thus tumor growth.\n\n\n \n12. \nStimulation of Vascular Cells to Enter the Cell cycle and\n \n\n\n\n\nUndergo Apoptosis in the Presence of Antagonists of Integrin α\n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\nβ\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nas Measured in the CAM Assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe angiogenic process clearly depends on the capacity of cytokines such as bFGF and VEGF to stimulate vascular cell proliferation. \nMignatti et al., J. Cell. Biochem., 471:201 (1991\n); \nTakeshita et al., J. Clin. Invest., 93:662 (1994\n); and \nKoyama et al., J. Cell. Physiol., 158:1 (1994\n). However, it is also apparent that signaling events may regulate the differentiation of these vascular cells into mature blood vessels. Thus, it is conceivable that interfering with signals related to either growth or differentiation of vascular cells undergoing new growth or angiogenesis may result in the perturbation of angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntegrin ligation events have been shown to participate in both cell proliferation as well as apoptosis or programmed cell death \nin vitro\n. \nSchwartz, Cancer Res., 51:1503 (1993\n); \nMeredith et al., Mol. Biol. Cell., 4:953 (1993\n); \nFrisch et al., J. Cell Biol., 124:619 (1994\n); and \nRuoslahti et al., Cell, 77:477 (1994\n). Close examination of the effects of α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists on angiogenesis reveals the presence of discontinuous and disrupted tumor-associated blood vessels. Therefore, it is possible that the loss of blood vessel continuity may be due to selective necrosis or apoptosis of vascular cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo explore this possibility, CAMs were examined after induction of angiogenesis with the growth factor bFGF and treatment with the mAb and cyclic peptides of this invention.\n\n\n \nA. \nTreatment with Monoclonal Antibodies\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nApoptosis can be detected by a variety of methods which include direct examination of DNA isolated from tissue to detect fragmentation of the DNA and the detection of 3'OH in intact tissue with an antibody that specifically detects free 3'OH groups of fragmented DNA.\n\n\n \n1) \nAnalysts of DNA Fragmentation\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAngiogenesis was induced by placing filter disks saturated with bFGF on the CAMs of 10-day old embryos as described in Examples 6A. Immunohistological analysis of CAMs with LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) revealed peak expression of α\nv\nβ\n3\n on \nblood vessels\n 12 to 24 hours after initiation of angiogenesis with bFGF. Thus, 24 hours after stimulation with bFGF, embryos were inoculated intravenously with 100 µl of PBS alone or PBS containing 300 µg of either mAb CSAT (anti-β\n1\n) or LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA fragmentation was detected by resecting the CAM tissue directly below bFGF saturated filter disks 24 or 48 hours after intravenous inoculations with mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n), CSAT (anti-β\n1\n), or PBS. Resected CAM tissues were washed three times with sterile PBS and finely minced, resuspended in 0.25% bacterial collagenase (Worthington Biochemical; Freehold, NJ) and incubated for 90 minutes at 37C with occasional vortexing. DNA was extracted from equal numbers of CAM cells from single cell suspension as previously described. \nBissonette, et al., Nature. 359:552 (1992\n). Briefly, equal numbers of CAM cells were lysed in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA in 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000x g for 15 minutes at 4C to separate soluble fragmented DNA from the intact chromatin pellet. Fragmented DNA was washed, precipitated, and analyzed on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSoluble fragmented DNA was isolated from an equal number of CAM cells from each treatment, separated electrophoretically on an agarose gel, and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. No difference was detected in the relative amount of DNA fragmentation resulting from the three different treatments 24 hours after treatment. However, by 48 hours following treatment with mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n), a significant increase in DNA fragmentation was observed when compared to embryos treated with either mAb CSAT (anti-β\n1\n) or PBS alone.\n\n\n \n2) \nStimulation of Vascular Cells to Enter the Cell Cycle\n \n\n\n \n \n \nTo experimentally examine the role of α\nv\nβ\n3\n in these processes, cells derived from CAMs treated with or without bFGF were stained with propidium iodide and immunoreacted with mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCAMs isolated from embryos 24 and 48 hours after treatment with mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n), CSAT (anti-β\n1\n), or PBS were dissociated into single cell suspensions by incubation with bacterial collagenase as described above. Single cells were then permeabilized and stained with Apop Tag Insitu Detection Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD). Apop Tag is an antibody that specifically detects free 3'OH groups of fragmented DNA. Detection of such free 3'OH groups is an established method for the detection of apoptotic cells. \nGavrieli et al., J. Cell Biol., 119:493 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApop Tag stained cells were then rinsed in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS and resuspended in FACS buffer containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide and 200 ug/ml RNase A in PBS. Cells were incubated for 1.5 hrs, washed, and analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting. Cell fluorescence was measured using a FACScan flow cytometer and data analyzed as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell fluorescence was measured with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) were determined simultaneously and all data were collected with a Hewlet Packard (HP9000) computer equipped with FACScan research software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). The data were analyzed with P.C Lysis version I software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Negative control gates were set by using cell suspensions without the addition of primary antibodies from the Apop Tag kit. Identical gating was applied to both cell populations resulting in the analysis of approximately 8,000 cells per different cell treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe percent of single cells derived from mAb treated CAMs and stained with Apop Tag as determined by FACS analysis is shown in \nFigure 18\n. The black bar represents cells from embryos treated 24 hours prior to analysis. The stippled bar represents cells from embryos treated 48 hours prior to analysis. Each bar represents the mean ± S.E. of three replicates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFigure 18\n, CAMs treated two days prior with mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) showed a 3 to 4-fold increase in Apop Tag staining as compared to CAMs treated with either PBS alone or CSAT (anti-β\n1\n).\n\n\n \nB. \nTreatment With Synthetic Peptides\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nCAM assays with growth factor-induced angiogenesis, as described in Example 6A, were also performed with the synthetic peptides of this invention to determine the effect of cyclic peptides on apoptosis. The peptides cyclo-RGDfV (66203) and cyclo-RADfV (69601) were prepared as described in Example 1. The peptide solutions or PBS were injected into the CAM preparation at a concentration of 300 ug/ml. At 24 and 48 hours, the filter paper and surrounding CAM tissue was dissected and stained with the Apop Tag to detect apoptosis as described above in Example 12A2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFigure 18\n, CAMs treated two days prior with peptide 69203 (cyclo-RGDfV) showed a 3 to 4-fold increase in Apop Tag staining as compared to CAMs treated with either PBS alone or control cyclic peptide 69601 (cyclo-RADfV).\n\n\n \nC. \nEffect of Treatment With Monoclonal Antibodies on Apaptosis and Cell Cycle\n (not part of the invention)\n\n\n \n \n \nSingle cell suspensions were also examined for the number of copies of chromosomal DNA by staining with propidium iodide to determine the effect of treatment with monoclonal antibodies on the cell cycle and for apoptosis by staining with the Apop Tag.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle cell suspensions of CAMS treated 24 or 48 hours prior with mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) or CSAT (anti-β\n1\n) or PBS were prepared as described in Example 12A1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor staining of cells with the Apop Tag, cell suspensions were washed three times with buffer containing 2.5% (w/v) BSA and 0.25% (w/v) sodium azide in PBS. Cells were then fixed in 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes followed by three washes as described above. To prevent nonspecific binding, single cell suspensions were blocked with 5% (w/v) BSA in PBS overnight at 4C. Cells were then washed as before, stained with Apop Tag, and cell fluorescence measured with a FACScan as described above in Example 12A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells from each experimental condition were stained with propidium iodide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 10 ug/ml in PBS for 1 hour, washed two times with PBS, and analyzed for nuclear characteristics typical of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation and segmentation. The percentage of apoptotic cells were estimated by morphological analysis of cells from at least 10 to 15 randomly selected microscopic fields.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combined results of single cell suspensions of CAMs from embryos treated with either CSAT (anti-β\n1\n) or LM609 (ant-α\nv\nβ\n3\n), stained with Apop Tag and propidium iodide, and analyzed by FACS are given in \nFigure 19\n. The Y axis represents Apop Tag staining (apoptosis), the X axis represents propidium iodide staining (DNA content). The horizontal line represents the negative gate for Apop Tag staining. The left and right panels indicate CAM cells from CSAT and LM609 treated embryos, respectively. Cell cycle analysis was performed by analysis of approximately 8,000 events per condition and data represented in a contour plot.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples of single cells stained with the DNA dye propidium iodide revealed that 25-30% of the LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) treated CAM cells 48 hours after treatment showed evidence of nuclear condensation and/or segmentation. These processes are characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis. This is in contrast to CAMs treated with CSAT (anti-β\n1\n) where 90-95% of the cells showed normal nuclear staining.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFigure 19\n, consistent with the induction of apoptosis by LM609, a significant number of cells in a peak containing less than one copy of DNA was observed (AO). This peak has been previously shown to represent fragmented DNA in late stage apoptotic cells. \nTelford et al., Cytometry, 13:137 (1992\n). Furthermore, these AO cells readily stain with Apop Tag confirming the ability of this reagent to detect apoptotic cells. However, in addition to the staining of cells in AO, a significant number of cells containing greater than one copy of DNA also stained with Apop Tag (\nFigure 19\n). These results demonstrate the LM609 has the ability to promote apoptosis among vascular cells that had already entered the cell cycle. In contrast, cells derived from control CAMs which had entered the cell cycle showed minimal Apop Tag staining consistent with the few apoptotic cells detected in control treated CAMs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong those cells in the bFGF stimulated CAMs that had entered the cell cycle (S and G2/M phase), 70% showed positive staining with LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n). This is compared to 10% LM609 staining observed among cycling cells from non-bFGF treated CAMs. These findings indicate that after bFGF stimulation, the majority of the α\nv\nβ\n3\n-bearing cells show active proliferation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together these findings indicate that intravenous injection of mAb LM609 or cyclic peptide antagonist of α\nv\nβ\n3\n promote apoptosis within the chick CAM following induction of angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCAMs were also examined histologically for expression of α\nv\nβ\n3\n by immunoreactivity with LM609 and for cells which were undergoing apoptosis by immunoreactivity with Apop Tag. CAM sections resected from embryos treated 48 hours prior with LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n), CSAT (anti-β\n1\n), or PBS prepared in Example 5A were washed, embedded in OTC (Baxter) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Six micron sections of CAM tissues were cut, fixed in acetone for 30 seconds, and stored at -70C until use. Tissue sections were prepared for staining by a brief rinse in 70% (v/v) ethanol (ETOH) followed by washing three times in PBS. Next, sections were blocked with 5% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 2 hours, followed by incubation with 10 ug/ml of mAb LM609 for 2 hours. The sections were then washed and incubated with a 1:50 dilution of rhodamine conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) for 2 hours. Finally, the same sections were washed and stained with the Apop Tag as described in Example 12A2). The stained tissue sections were mounted and analyzed by confocal immunofluorescent microscopy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nFigure 20\n, panels A through C represent CAM tissue from CSAT (anti-β\n1\n) treated embryos and panels D through F represent CAM tissue from LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) treated embryos. Panels A and D depict tissues stained with Apop Tag and visualized by fluorescence (FITC) superimposed on a D.I.C. image. Panels B and E depict the same tissues stained with mAb LM609 (anti-α\nv\nβ\n3\n) and visualized by fluorescence (rhodamine). Panels C and F represent merged images of the same tissues stained with both Apop Tag and LM609 where yellow staining represents colocalization. The bar represents 15 and 50 µm in the left and right panels, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFigure 20\n (A-C), after intravenous injection of CSAT or PBS control, staining with Apop Tag appeared minimal and random, indicating a minimal level of apoptosis within the tissue. In contrast, CAMs from embryos previously treated with LM609 or \ncyclic peptide\n 203 showed a majority of the vessels staining intensely with Apop Tag while minimal reactivity was observed among surrounding nonvascular cells (\nFigure 20 D-F\n). Furthermore, when both Apop Tag and LM609 were used to stain these tissues (19C and 19F) significant co-localization was only observed between these markers in CAMs derived from embryos treated with α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists (\nFigure 20F\n). These findings demonstrate that after induction of angiogenesis \nin vivo,\n inhibitors of integrin α\nv\nβ\n3\n selectively promote apoptosis of α\nv\nβ\n3\n-bearing blood vessels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile angiogenesis is a complex process involving many molecular and cell biological events, several lines of evidence suggest that vascular cell integrin α\nv\nβ\n3\n plays a relatively late role in this process. First, immunohistological analysis reveals that expression of α\nv\nβ\n3\n on vascular cells reached a maximum 12-24 hours after the induction of angiogenesis with bFGF. Secondly, antagonists of α\nv\nβ\n3\n perturb angiogenesis induced by multiple activators suggesting that this receptor is involved in common pathway downstream from perhaps all primary signaling events leading to angiogenesis. Thirdly, mAb LM609 or cyclic peptide treated CAMs did not show a significant increase in apoptosis as measured by DNA laddering until 48 hours post treatment with these antagonists. Finally, antagonists of α\nv\nβ\n3\n promote apoptosis of vascular cells that have already been induced to enter the cell cycle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results presented herein provide the first direct evidence that integrin ligation events can regulate cell survival \nin vivo\n. It is therefore hypothesized that once angiogenesis begins, individual vascular cells divide and begin to move toward the angiogenic source, after which, α\nv\nβ\n3\n ligation provides a signal allowing continued cell survival which leads to differentiation and the formation of mature blood vessels. However, if α\nv\nβ\n3\n ligation is prevented then the cells fail to receive this molecular cue and the cells go into apoptosis by default. This hypothesis would also predict that after differentiation has occurred mature blood vessels no longer require α\nv\nβ\n3\n signaling for survival and thus are refractory to antagonists of this integrin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, the results presented herein provide evidence that antagonists of integrin α\nv\nβ\n3\n may provide a powerful therapeutic approach for the treatment of neoplasia or other diseases characterized by angiogenesis. First, antagonists of α\nv\nβ\n3\n disrupt newly forming blood vessels without affecting the pre-existing vasculature. Second, these antagonists had no significant effect on chick embryo viability, suggesting they are non-toxic. Third, angiogenesis was significantly blocked regardless of the angiogenic stimuli. Finally, systemic administration of α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists causes dramatic regression of various histologically distinct human tumors.\n\n\n \n13. \nPreparation of Organic Molecule α\n \n \nv\n \n \nβ\n \n \n3\n \n \nAntagonists\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe synthesis of organic α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonist Compounds 7 (96112), 9 (99799), 10 (96229), 12 (112854), 14 (96113), 15 (79959)\n*\n, 16 (81218)\n*\n, 17 (87292)\n*\n and 18 (87293)\n*\n is described below and is also shown in the noted figures.

The results are shown in \nFigure 28\n where as above, compounds 14 (96113) and 10 (96229) almost completely inhibited the formation of new blood vessels induced by bFGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the aforementioned Examples demonstrate that integrin α\nv\nβ\n3\n plays a key role in angiogenesis induced by a variety of stimuli and as such α\nv\nβ\n3\n is a valuable therapeutic target with the α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists of this invention for diseases characterized by neovascularization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe foregoing written specification is considered to be sufficient to enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention. The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the cell line deposited, since the deposited embodiment is intended as a single illustration of one aspect of the invention and any cell line that is functionally equivalent is within the scope of this invention.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to the identification of microscopic and submicroscopic targets in medical, industrial, or environmental samples.\n\n\n \n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDetecting, enumerating, and identifying low levels of molecular targets is a cornerstone of routine medical, industrial, and environmental diagnostics. For example, samples are analyzed to detect molecules from infectious agents, cancer cells, hormones, manufacturing contaminants, and pollutants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough numerous disparate and powerful methods for routine detection of low levels of molecules have been commercialized there are still gaps in the testing repertoire. Some of these gaps became apparent following the bioterror attacks in 2001. For example, there is an unmet need for rapid, ultra-sensitive, cost-effective, and user-friendly tests to screen simultaneously for multiple types of agents at the point of exposure. Both healthcare and industry are hampered by the lack of rapid, sensitive, and easy-to-use diagnostic tests that can be conducted on-site by non-medical personnel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe discussion that follows focuses on routine medical diagnostics; similar methods are used for industrial and environmental applications.\n\n\n \n\n\nImmunological methods\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nImmunological tests, or immunoassays, are ubiquitous in medical diagnostics. Based on the interaction of antibodies and the corresponding targets (called antigens), immunoassays are used to detect a broad range of molecules ranging in size from small (\ne\n.\ng\n., a drug of abuse) to large (\ne\n.\ng\n., an HIV protein). Serological tests are immunological assays that, rather than testing directly for antigens, test for a host immunological response to previous exposure to the antigen - \ni\n.\ne\n., they test for the presence of host antibodies to the antigen. Numerous immunoassay systems are available ranging from large automated central lab systems to over-the-counter pregnancy tests. The tests cover a broad range of formats including agglutination assays, precipitin assays, enzyme-linked immunoassays, direct fluorescence assays, immuno-histological tests, complement-fixation assays, serological tests, immuno-electrophoretic assays, and rapid \"strip\" tests (\ne\n.\ng\n., lateral flow and flow through tests). Immunological tests can be extremely simple and rapid. Thus, many of the most desirable tests, those that can be conducted in a physician's office or at home by the patient, are immunological tests. One drawback of commercialized rapid immunological tests is that they are insensitive.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe need for commercially accessible sensitive immunoassays will increase in coming years. One of the first major payoffs of the human genome and proteome projects will be numerous new markers for diagnosing disease states, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disease. These markers may occur in trace amounts in clinical samples, such as blood, urine, and solid tissues. Commercialized rapid immunoassay tests, which are appropriate for high abundance protein markers (such as PSA, myoglobin, and antibodies, for example), may be inadequate for detecting the substantial fraction of proteins present at low concentrations.\n\n\n \n\n\nGenetic methods\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nGenetic methods are general and powerful tools for detecting and identifying nucleic acid molecules from organisms and viruses. Revolutionary new methods for ultra-sensitively detecting and distinguishing the nucleic acid content of cells and viruses based on nucleic acid amplification have recently been developed. For example, commercial tests can detect the nucleic acids from a small number of sub-microscopic HIV virus particles (\ne\n.\ng\n., 50 particles/ml). Amplification technologies include the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), ligase chain reaction (LCR), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), Transcription Mediated Amplification (TMA), and rolling circle amplification (RCA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid amplification-based tests have several drawbacks that have hampered their exploitation in routine clinical and commercial diagnostics. The tests are generally much more expensive than microbial culture tests; require high user expertise; involve demanding sample preparation protocols; generally require a time-consuming amplification step; suffer from vulnerability to contamination and false positives; have enzymatic steps that are sensitive to inhibitors found in many clinical samples and lead to false negatives; and often have reproducibility problems in multiplexed applications. Furthermore, like microbial culture methods these methods are not well-suited to detect important classes of non-nuceic acid targets (\ne\n.\ng\n., toxins, hormones, drugs-of-abuse, and proteins).\n\n\n \n\n\nBiochemical, chemical, and physical methods\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOther technologies for sensitive detection of microscopic and sub-microscopic targets include flow cytometry, mass spectroscopy, biosensors, absorbance spectroscopy, fluorescence polarization, fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy, electrophoresis, and chromatography, among many others. Because of the expense and expertise typically required, most of these methods have remained in the province of the research laboratory.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne method that has proved useful in clinical diagnostic laboratories is flow cytometry. Flow cytometric methods are used for quantitatively detecting particular cell types on the basis of the ability to bind labeled probes (\ne\n.\ng\n., stains, antibodies, or nucleic acids). Individual cells or particles are forced to flow through a narrow channel, one at a time, past a laser beam. Fluorescence emission and size/shape information is gathered by analyzing the spectrum and light scattering caused by the organism/particle. Thousands of individual cells or particles can be analyzed per minute. For example, flow cytometry is used to quantify the population sizes of classes of lymphocytes in patients with AIDS. A highly multiplexed flow cytometric method that can detect and identify non-cellular molecules such as proteins or nucleic acids has been commercialized by Luminex (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,981,180\n \n). Drawbacks of the flow cytometric method include the expense, required operator skill, inability to analyze large sample volumes (which limits sensitivity).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiosensor technologies also hold promise for sensitive molecular detection. Biosensors use physical methods to convert a biological event, for example binding of an antibody to an antigen, to a detectable signal. One popular biosensor used for molecular detection uses surface plasmon resonance (\nMullett, W. M., et al. (2000). Methods 22: 77-91\n). Thermo BioStar's optical immunoassay (\nSchultze, D., et al. (2001). Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis 20: 280-3\n) uses the principle of optical interference to detect binding of antigens to antibodies. The BARC biosensor technology uses magnetoresistive detection (as used for hard disk storage) of analytes tagged with single magnetic microparticles (\nEdelstein, R. L., et al., Biosens Bioelectron 14: 805-13, 2000\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nPoint-of-care and on-site methods\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPoint-of-care tests allow professionals and consumers to perform diagnostic tests outside of dedicated central laboratories. Point-of-care diagnostics is one of the fastest growing segments in \nin vitro\n diagnostics. Typical point-of-care testing locations include the patient's bedside in hospitals; physician office labs; nursing homes; public and private health clinics; college health centers; correctional facilities; emergency vehicles; the workplace and home. Numerous point-of-care tests have been introduced in recent years and some have been extraordinarily successful. Commercialized point-of-care tests fall into several categories, those which test for: (1) metabolites (e.g., glucose and urea), inorganic molecules, drugs, and blood gases; (2) tests for macromolecules and hormones; and (3) tests for disease-causing agents (e.g., bacteria, viruses, parasites).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile very successful for analytes that occur at relatively high concentrations (\ne\n.\ng\n., blood glucose), developing point-of-care tests for low abundance target molecules has been problematic. This difficulty is largely attributable to combining two mutually antagonistic product requirements: (1) the need for sophisticated technology to meet demanding test specifications including ultra-sensitivity and (2) the need for low cost, user-friendly, and portable tests that can be operated by unskilled operators.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome commercialized or emerging ultra-sensitive point-of-care tests are adaptations of formats used for less sensitive commercialized tests. For example, Response Biomedical Corp. has commercialized a 10-minute strip test (or lateral flow test) based on its RAMP platform, which uses fluorescently dyed microbead labels (\nBrooks, D. E., et al. (1999). Clin Chem 45: 1676-1678\n.). Similarly, Biosite's rapid strip tests detect drugs-of-abuse, cardiac markers, and infectious agents (\nLandry, M. L., et al. (2001). J Clin Microbiol 39: 1855-8\n.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPoint-of-care tests based on nucleic acid amplification have been difficult to develop because of their complexity and expense. One system is Cepheid's Smart Cycler system. Another nucleic acid amplification test for \nB. anthracis\n has been developed by the Mayo Clinic in collaboration with Roche (Light Cycler; \nMakino, S. I., et al. (2001). Lett Appl Microbiol 33: 237-40\n.). These systems carry both the advantages and disadvantages inherent to PCR methods. Amplification methods can deliver impressive analytical sensitivity and can be moderately rapid, for example, the Smart Cycler can deliver results in an hour (\nBelanger, S. D., et al. (2002). Journal of Clinical Microbiology 40: 1436-40\n). The analytes are limited to those containing nucleic acid (ruling out tests for protein toxins and small molecules, for example); false negatives can result from sample inhibition; highly multiplexed tests are problematic; the tests require trained personnel; and the tests are expensive.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiosensor-based point-of-care technologies also hold promise as they can combine impressive technical specifications with low-cost and user-friendliness. For example, Thermo Biostar's OIA technology, which can test for pathogens such as influenza virus, relies on a biosensor with an optically activated surface that changes color upon binding of viral antigens because of changes in optical interference (\nRodriguez, W. J., et al. (2002). Pediatr Infect Dis J 21: 193-6\n.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the emerging technologies focus on improved multiplexing. For example, Biosite is developing a highly parallel capillary microfluidic immunoassay system. Somalogic's technology uses aptamer arrays to analyze samples for hundreds or even thousands of analytes (\nBrody, E. N., et al. (1999). Mol Diagn 4: 381-8\n). Nanogen's NanoChip (\nEwalt, K. L., et al. (2001). Anal Biochem 289: 162-72\n.) electronic arrays are also being applied to detecting agents of bioterrorism. While tests that screen for hundreds of analytes are of clear value for drug discovery, it is less clear whether this level of multiplexing will be important for point-of-care tests.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious new labeling/detection strategies for improving the sensitivity of point-of-care tests are also being directed towards tests for biowarfare agents. Orasure's new quantitative drugs-of-abuse tests use UPT (up-converting phosphor technology) particles (\nNiedbala, R. S., et al. (2001). Anal Biochem 293: 22-30\n.). The Navy's BARC technology uses magnetic particles and detectors to sensitively analyze samples for specific analytes (\nEdelstein, R. L., et al. (2000). Biosens Bloelectron 14: 805-13\n.). Other new labeling methods including quantum dot nanocrystals (Quantum Dot; \nWang, C., et al. (2001). Science 291: 2390-2\n.) and resonance light scattering particles (Genicon; \nYguerabide, J., et al. (2001). J Cell Biochem Suppl Suppl: 71-81\n.) could also potentially improve the sensitivity of point-of-care tests.\n\n\n \n\n\nUnmet needs for molecular diagnostics\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThere is a critical unmet need for efficient biowarfare agent detection by first-responders at the point-of-exposure and by routine automated scanning of building air and water supply. Similarly, because of the lack of sensitive on-site testing, clinic patients can not be sensitively tested on-site for sexually-transmitted disease pathogens, and post-surgicai patients can not be quickly and sensitively screened for blood infection. The need for new technologies to address this gap may become even more acute as new diagnostic markers for diseases (including cancer, infectious disease, and cardiovascular disease) inevitably emerge from the genome and proteome projects.\n\n\n \n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides efficient methods for rapidly and sensitively identifying molecular targets in medical, industrial, and environmental samples. The invention labels target molecules and then images them using large area imaging. Diagnostic tests based on the invention can be rapid, ultrasensitive, quantitative, multiplexed, and automated. The tests minimize sample preparation and do not require nucleic acid amplification or cell culture. A broad range of infectious agents (\ne\n.\ng\n., bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) and molecules (\ne\n.\ng\n., proteins, DNA, RNA, hormones, and drugs) can be detected by the tests. Tests based on the invention can deliver the high level sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification tests, the user-friendliness and speed of immunoassays, as well as the cost effectiveness and quantification offered by microbiological tests. The invention addresses an important unmet needs in point-of-care or on-site diagnostics by enabling rapid, ultra-sensitive, cost-effective, and portable tests. Thus, the invention embodies the best attributes of the current diagnostic technologies, while filling gaps in the diagnostic repertoire.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention relates to a method for detecting target molecules in a sample, wherein said method comprises the steps of:\n\n \n \n \na. contacting said target molecules with labelling particles that specifically bind to the target molecules, wherein the ratio of target molecules to labelling particles is less than 100,\n \nb. selecting or capturing target molecule:labelling particle complexes so that the complexes are separated from unbound labelling particles and the complexes are deposited in a detection zone that projects onto a detection area having a longest linear dimension of greater than 1 mm, and\n \nc. simultaneously optically detecting individual target molecule: labelling particle complexes in said detection area so that the number of said complexes is enumerated.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the invention to detect low levels of target molecules rapidly and cost-effectively results from the advantages of combining high intensity labeling, formats that facilitate rapid reaction kinetics, and large area imaging based using either instrumentation made from off-the-shelf commercial components or no instrumentation at all. Table1 lists some of some of the advantages of the invention.\n\n \n \nTable 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSelected advantages of the invention\n \n \n \n \n \n•\n \nRapid results (< 15 min)\n \n \n \n•\n \nUltra-sensitive\n \n \n \n•\n \nEasy-to-use\n \n \n \n•\n \nCost-effective\n \n \n \n•\n \nMultiple targets analyzed\n \n \n \n \n \nsimultaneously\n \n \n \n•\n \nScans for proteins; nucleic acids,\n \n \n \n \n \nviruses, bacteria, and parasites\n \n \n \n•\n \nAnalyzes large or small volumes\n \n \n \n•\n \nAutomated quantitative analysis\n \n \n \n•\n \nPortable (some embodiments)\n \n \n \n•\n \nMinimal sample preparation\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention detects low levels of target molecules by labeling them with target-specific particles or complexes that generate high-intensity signals. These complexes have two functions, affinity for specific targets and signal generation. These functions are fulfilled by the two moieties on the complexes: category-binding molecules, which bind specifically to the target molecules and signaling moieties, which are used to detect the particles. Labels that generate high intensity signals with a characteristic signature (\ne\n.\ng\n., specific wavelengths of emitted light) enable rapid and ultra-sensitive detection and also allow efficient discrimination of true positives from artifacts (\ne\n.\ng\n., fluorescent dust particles). A variety of signal generating complexes can be used including fluorescently dyed, light-scattering, quantum dot, phosphor, and enzyme-coated particles. These particles, in turn, can generate a variety of types of signals including fluorescent, chemiluminescent, and colorimetric. Similarly, a variety of category-binding molecules can be used including antibodies, nucleic acids, ligands, and aptamers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause the invention detects molecules, the range of targets is broad including both soluble molecules and molecules that are part of larger targets such as viruses, bacteria, or cells from animals or plants. The range of diagnostic questions that can be addressed by the invention also is broadened by the ability to use various types of target-specific molecules including antibodies, nucleic acids, aptamers, and ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetecting small numbers of target molecules in large volumes is a requirement when testing some clinical, environmental, and manufacturing samples. The invention's ability to survey large samples for low levels of target molecules rests, in part, on its ability detect \nindividual microscopic signal generating particles without magnification\n. Non-magnified detection allows a large area to be surveyed for small numbers of the particles in a single image. Imaging a large area, in turn, is a key to the invention's ability to analyze large sample volumes efficiently. Detecting labeled particles in large volumes using high power microscopy or microfluidics can require challenging concentration steps or analysis of thousands of images. Methods that scan for small numbers of particles using microscopic beams become very time consuming and expensive when applied to large areas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnumerating individual microscopic labels adds robustness to the results of tests based on the invention. In contrast to many large area imaging methods for analyzing molecular targets, the invention generally compares individual signals directly to small neighboring regions. This comparison improves the signal to background ratio for samples containing few labeled target molecules compared to methods that integrate the total signal and background in a large area.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother advantage of detecting individual labeling particles is that the sensitivity of the tests can be increased without sacrificing speed by increasing the sample volume with a proportionate increase in the size of the test format (see results section of Example 8 on page 38 for an explanation).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnumerating individual signals in a large area image also decreases the chance of false positive results. (False positive results are positive test results that occur when the actual target molecule is not present). This enumerating method is an advantage compared with methods that detect a single integrated signal, such as methods that measure the total amount of a molecule (\ne\n.\ng\n., ATP, antigens, or nucleic acids) in the sample. Any artifact that causes a signal can generate a false positive when using methods that rely on signal integration. Consider a sample that contains 482 positive signals, each of which generates 100 fluorescent units. The result of an integrative method is a single number (48,200 fluorescent units). Artifacts that generate a similar number of fluorescent units, for example, a large fluorescent dust particle may be indistinguishable. In contrast, the present invention can easily distinguish between a single large fluorescent dust particle and 482 positive signals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTests constructed using the invention can detect target molecules over a broad range of concentrations, from very low levels to high levels. This property of the invention, its large dynamic range, allows users to forgo the sample preparation steps (\ne\n.\ng\n., multiple dilutions) that are often required by technologies that have small dynamic ranges.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTests based on the invention can exploit a variety of useful formats ranging from single-use strip tests that are simple, non-instrumented, and cost-effective, to sophisticated automated benchtop systems for continuous unattended environmental monitoring. Especially important is the compatibility of the invention with formats that maximize the rates of reaction during the test (\ne\n.\ng\n., the rate of binding the target molecules to the target-specific label). For example, binding reactions occur rapidly in porous membranes used by some embodiments of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious detection methods can be used by the invention including visual, film-based, and electronic detection. The range of detection methods is an advantage for addressing a broad spectrum of diagnostic problems and testing venues. For example, for portable systems, minimizing size and weight is an advantage. Embodiments of the invention that minimize or eliminate instrumentation are particularly useful for portability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther features and advantages will be apparent from the following description and the claims.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy target molecule is meant a molecule that is potentially present in a sample and whose presence is tested for by the invention. Target molecules may be distinct molecules, or they may be physically associated with other molecules, cells, or material in the sample. For example, a test for detecting the fungal pathogen \nCandida albicans\n might detect three different DNA sequences that are unique to the genome of the organism. These three sequences are considered to be distinct target molecules even though they are physically associated in the genome of the fungus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \ncategory\n of target molecule is meant multiple target molecules that have in common one or more features and that are considered identical for the purposes of a test constructed using the invention. For example, the category of one test could be envelope protein from the virus that causes AIDS. For example, consider a test designed to detect the envelope protein of all HIV viruses, without differentiating the HIV-1 and HIV-2 variants. In this case, the category of the target molecule includes the envelope proteins of both HIV-1 and HIV-2. The goal of another test might be to distinguish HIV-1 from HIV-2. In this case, the envelope proteins from each type of HIV would be considered a different category. Alternatively, consider the three DNA probes for \nC. albicans\n in the definition for target molecules above. If the goal of the test is to detect \nC. albicans\n, the three probes are considered identical for the purpose of the test because they share the common feature that they bind specifically to \nC. albicans\n. Therefore the three target molecules would be considered to be in the same category of target molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nnon-overlapping categories\n of target molecules is meant categories of target molecules whose union is the null set. That is, no member of any of the categories is a member of any of the other sets. For example, the categories of IL-2, thrombin, PSA, and myoglobin are non-overlapping categories.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTests that detect and identify multiple categories generally (but not always) detect multiple non-overlapping categories of target molecules. For example, consider a test designed to identify HIV, HCV, and HBV viruses in blood. Such a test would be designed to differentiate three non-overlapping categories of target molecules, one for each of the three types of viruses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy the \ncategorical complexity\n of a test is meant the number of non-overlapping categories of target molecules that are detected in the test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \na category-specific binding site\n is meant a site on a target molecule that \nspecifically binds\n to a category-binding molecule under \nspecific-binding conditions\n and that distinguishes target molecules that are members of a particular category to be identified in a test from target molecules that are not members of that category but might also be present in the test sample. That is, the site is typically present on all members of one category, and typically not on any members of non-over lapping categories. Category-specific binding sites \nspecifically bind\n to \ncategory-specific binding molecules\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsider, for example, an epitope (an antigenic site) on a HIV viral envelope protein that specifically binds to an antibody category-binding molecule. The target molecule is the viral envelope protein and the category-specific binding site is the epitope on the envelope protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a test scans a sample for a category of target molecules that is characteristic of a taxonomic group, a category-specific binding site is one that is typically present on the target molecules of all members of that taxonomic group, but is typically not present on all members of other taxonomic groups that might be present in the test sample. An example is a site on an HIV membrane protein that binds to a particular monoclonal antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a test might scan a sample for category-specific binding sites that are shared by members of different taxonomic groups. Examples of this type of category-specific binding sites include various macromolecules (\ne\n.\ng\n., DNA) and genes, mRNAs, and proteins that confer antibiotic resistance, confer virulence, or indicate viability. A category-specific binding site is often a part of a larger molecule or complex. For example, a category-specific genomic sequence can be used as a category-specific binding site in a test. Such a category-specific binding site is part of a much larger genome that may contain (\n1\n) sections that are not category-specific; (2) sections that are category-specific binding sites but for which the test does not scan; and (3) other sections that are distinct category-specific sequences for which the test does scan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding sites that are present in, e.g., 80%, 90%, 95%, or more than 99% of the target molecules that are members of a category but that are absent in, e.g., 80%, 90%, 95%, or more than 99% of the target molecules that are members of all other categories of the same class, are considered category-specific binding sites. Note that a category-specific binding site can be trivially or exceptionally absent from a target molecule that is a member of the category. Similarly, a category-specific binding site can be trivially or exceptionally present in a target molecule that is not a member of a category. For example, consider a protein site that occurs in essentially all \nE. coli\n bacteria but in no other bacterial species. If, as might be the case in less than one cell out of millions of bacteria, a mutation causes the protein to not be produced, the marker will not be present in that strain of \nE. coli\n. This protein site is still considered a category-specific binding site. Alternatively, the gene for the same protein is transferred to a strain of a different species of bacteria by recombinant DNA technology or by natural means (\ne\n.\ng\n., by viral transduction). In this case, a bacterial strain that is not a member of the \nE. coli\n group would express what would still be considered an \nE. coli\n-specific binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \ncategory-binding molecule\n is meant a molecule or molecular complex that \nspecifically binds\n to a category-specific binding site. Examples of category-binding molecules are nucleic acid probes that hybridize to genomic DNA; nucleic acid aptamers that have been selected or \"evolved\" \nin vitro\n to bind specifically to sites on proteins; antibodies that bind to cellular antigens or serum proteins; and ligands such as epidermal growth factor or biotin that bind specifically to hormone receptors or to binding molecules, such as avidin. Two category-binding molecules are said to be distinct if they bind to distinct and non-overlapping category-specifc binding sites. Category-binding molecules may be referred to according to their molecular composition, \ne\n.\ng\n., a category binding oligonucleotide, probe, antibody, ligand, \netc\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \ncapture molecule\n is meant a category-binding molecule that is stably bound to a surface, membrane, or other matrix that is not a particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy a category-binding molecule that \nspecifically binds\n to a category of target molecules is meant a category-binding molecule that binds under defined \nbinding conditions\n to essentially all target molecules that are members of a category scanned for by a test, but to essentially no other molecules that are likely to be present in the sample. The number of category-binding molecules that are bound by target molecules in a category scanned for as compared to the number bound by target molecules not in such a category, are typically two-fold, five-fold, ten-fold, or greater than fifty-fold greater.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nbinding conditions\n is meant the conditions used in a test to achieve specific binding of category-binding molecules to category-specific binding sites. For example, when the category-binding molecules are category-specific DNA probes, the binding conditions for a particular test might be stringent DNA hybridization conditions. The appropriate stringent DNA hybridization conditions depend on the nature of the probes, as is well known by those familiar with the art. For example, for typical DNA probes of length greater than 500 bases, an appropriate binding condition (usually referred to as a \"washing condition\" in the hybridization vernacular) is 65°C at 0.2X SSC. For binding an antibody to an antigen, typical binding conditions are room temperature in PBS-TB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy a \nfamily\n of category-binding molecules is meant a set of category-binding molecules that specifically bind to a particular category of target molecules. A polyclonal antibody preparation raised to Hepatitis C virus core protein constitutes a family of category-binding molecules since it comprises multiple distinct antibodies that bind specifically to the same category of target molecule - HCV core protein. Polyclonal antibodies generally constitute families of category-binding molecules since they usually include multiple distinct category-binding molecules that bind to the same category of target molecule. Note that, unless affinity purification is used, polyclonal antibody preparations typically also contain antibodies that \ndo not\n bind to the chosen category of target molecule and may contain antibodies that bind to other categories because the antibody repertoire of an animal is determined by the animal's infection history. Therefore, polyclonal antibodies are preferably purified by affinity methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCategory-binding molecules in a family might bind to some target molecules in the category but not to others. For example, consider HIV-1 envelope protein-specific antibodies that do not cross-react with HIV-2 envelope protein, and HIV-2-specific antibodies that do not cross-react with HIV-1 envelope protein. If HIV is to be a detected as a category in a test without differentiating between HIV-1 or HIV-2, a mixture of the two types of antibodies could be labeled with signaling moieties with the same signal signature. The same signal is obtained whether HIV-1 or HIV-2 is present when this family of category-binding molecules, which is a mixture of the two antibody preparations, is used in a test. (Note that if antibodies are used to capture the HIV target molecules at a site in the detection zone in this example, a mixture of anti-HIV-1 and anti-HIV-2 capture antibodies is used at the site).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of a family of category-binding molecules is a set of 80 category-specific genomic DNA sequences that occur in all \nE. coli\n O157:H7 strains but that do not occur in members of other groups of bacteria. This family of category-binding molecules can hybridize as a group to suitably prepared \nE. coli\n O157:H7 cells but does not hybridize to other categories of cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nnon-overlapping families\n of category-binding molecules or is meant families of category-binding molecules in which each family binds specifically to one, and only one, category of target molecules in a set of non-overlapping categories of target molecules. That is, a set of non-overlapping families of category-binding molecules map to a congruent set of non-overlapping categories of target molecules. For example, in a test that scans for the target molecules that characterize the 4 USP objectionable organisms \nE. coli, Salmonella, Pseudomonas\n spp., and \nStaphylococcus aureus,\n there are four non-overlapping categories of target molecules. Such a test might incorporate four different non-cross-reacting polyclonal antibodies, each specific for one of the target molecule categories. Thus, the test comprises four non-overlapping families of category-binding molecules. The non-overlapping families of category-binding molecules in a test are called an ensemble of category-binding molecules (see definition below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy an \nensemble of category-binding molecules\n is meant a set of one or more non-overlapping families of category-binding molecules that are combined in a mixture for a particular test. Tests that scan for multiple non-overlapping categories of target molecules comprise one family of category-binding molecules per category. The entire set of category-binding molecules, that comprise these families, is referred to as an ensemble. For example, consider a test that scans for the presence of five types of upper respiratory viruses (RSV, influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza, and adenovirus) using five virus-specific monoclonal antibodies. The five monoclonal antibodies constitute five non-overlapping families of category-binding molecules. The combined set of antibodies is an ensemble of category-binding molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy the \ncategory-binding molecule complexity\n of an ensemble is meant the number of distinct category-binding molecules in an ensemble. For example, if an ensemble of category-binding molecules consisted of 234 oligonucleotide probes, the category-binding molecule complexity of the ensemble would be 234.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy the \nfamily complexity\n of an ensemble is meant the number of non-overlapping families of category-binding molecules in an ensemble. The family complexity is the same as the minimum number of target molecules required to bind a category-binding molecule from each of the families in an ensemble. The family complexity of a test corresponds to the categorical complexity of a test - \ni\n.\ne\n., the number of distinct categories for which the sample is scanned. In general, the family complexity also corresponds to the number of distinct signal signatures used in a test. Consider an ensemble of target molecule-specific antibodies designed to detect four human cytokine proteins: granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF); interieukin-2 (IL-2); interleukin-4 (IL-4); and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The family complexity of the ensemble is four, since no subset of target molecules smaller than four could suffice to bind each of the antibodies in the ensemble. As another example, consider an ensemble of DNA probes consisting of three families of probes. One family consists of a set of 12 \nE. coli\n-specific category-binding DNA sequences, another family consists of a set of 10 rotavirus category binding DNA sequences, and another family consists of a set of 15 \nGiardia\n category binding DNA sequences. The family complexity of this probe ensemble is three since three categories of target molecules (\nE. coli\n, rotovirus, and \nGiardia\n specific target molecules) are required to bind to all of the probes in the ensemble.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nsignal element\n is meant a molecule or particle that directly generates a detectable signal. The phrase \"directly generates\" refers to the fact that signal elements are the immediate source or critical modulator of the detectable signal. Thus, if the signal is photons that arise from a fluorophore, the fluorophore is the immediate source of the photons and, therefore, is a signal element. If the signal is photons scattered by an RLS particle, the RLS particle is a signal element. Alternatively, if the signal is the light transmitted or scattered from a chromogenic precipitated product of the enzyme horseradish peroxidase, the chromogenic product is the signal element.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA characteristic of a signal element is that such an element cannot be divided into parts such that each part generates a signal that is comparable (in character, not necessarily in intensity) to the whole. Thus, a 2 nM diameter quantum dot is a signal element, as dividing it changes the character (emission spectrum) of the resulting nanocrystals. A 5 µm particle impregnated with a fluorescent dye such as fluorescein, is not a signaling element, since it could be divided into parts such that each part has signaling characteristics comparable to the intact particle. The molecule fluorescein, in contrast, is a signaling element. The detectable products of signal generating enzymes (\ne\n.\ng\n., luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase) are also considered signal elements. Such signal elements (or their precursors when there is a chemical conversion of a precursor to a signal element) may be diffusible substances, insoluble products, and/or unstable intermediates. For example, the enzyme alkaline phosphatase converts the chemiluminescent substrate CDP-Star (NEN; catalog number NEL-601) to an activated product, which is a photon-emitting \nsignal element.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nsignaling moiety\n is meant a molecule, particle, or substance comprising or producing (in the case of enzymes) one or more signal elements and that is or can be conjugated to a category-binding molecule. The signaling moiety can be attached to the category-binding molecule either covalently or non-covalently and either directly or indirectly (\ne\n.\ng\n., via one or more adaptor or \"chemical linker\" moieties or by both moieties being conjugated to the same particle). Examples of signaling moieties include carboxylated quantum dots; a fluorophore such as Texas Red that is modified for binding to a nucleic acid probe or an antibody probe; streptavidin-coated fluorescent polystyrene particles (which can be conjugated to biotinylated category-specific binding proteins); a rolling-circle replication product containing repeated nucleic acid sequences each of which can hybridized to several oligonucleotides tailed with fluorescenfly modified nucleotides and which contains a category-specific binding oligonucleotide at the 5' end. A signaling moiety can comprise physically distinct elements. For example, in some cases the signaling moiety is an enzyme (\ne\n.\ng\n., alkaline phosphatase) that is conjugated to a category-binding molecule (an antibody, for example). Signal is generated when a substrate of alkaline phosphatase (\ne\n.\ng\n., CDP-Star, or BM purple from NEN and Roche, respectively) is converted to products that are signal elements (\ne\n.\ng\n., an unstable intermediate that emits a photon, or a precipitable chromogenic product). It is not unusual for the category-binding molecules, enzymatic signaling moieties, and substrate to be applied to the reaction at distinct times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nsignaling moiety complex\n is meant a physical entity that comprises more than one signaling moiety and more than one category-binding molecule. The physical association of the signaling moieties and category-binding molecules in a signaling moiety complex must be stable (\ne\n.\ng\n., the signaling moieties and category-binding molecules should have mean half-lives of association with the complex of at least one day in PBS at 4°C). As an example of a signaling moiety complex, consider a polystyrene microparticle that is coated with thousands of molecules of two types: a target molecule-specific antibody and alkaline phosphatase. Such a signaling moiety complex binds to the target molecule via the conjugated antibody category-binding molecule. When incubated with a chromogenic alkaline phosphatase substrate (the signal element; \ne\n.\ng\n., BM purple, Roche), a colored spot can be generated which can be detected by eye. Alternatively, the same signaling moiety complex, when incubated with either a chemiluminescent or a fluorescent alkaline phosphatase substrate, generates either a chemiluminescent or fluorescent signal. Further examples of signaling moiety complexes include: nanogold particles conjugated to fluorescein-labeled antibodies and latex particles conjugated to both oligonucleotide category-binding molecules and acridinium esters that chemiluminescence upon addition of hydrogen peroxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nparticle\n is meant a matrix which is larger than 50 microns in size. The size of a population or batch of particles is defined as the mean measurement of the longest pair of orthogonal dimensions for a sample of the particles. The longest pair of orthogonal dimensions is the pair of orthogonal dimensions of a particle, the sum of the lengths of which is the maximum for all such sums for the particle. If a sample of two particles has a longest pair of orthogonal dimensions of 1 micron × 2 micron and 2 micron × 3 micron, respectively, the mean measurement of the longest pair of orthogonal dimensions is 2 microns [(1+2+2+3)/4 = 2 microns]. The mean measurement of the longest pair of orthogonal dimensions for a sample of particles is, e.g., less than 50 microns, less than 20 microns, or less than 5 microns.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany particles have some characteristics of a solid. However, molecular scaffolds or complexes, which may not be rigid, are also defined as particles. For example, dendrimers or other branching molecular structures are considered to be particles. Similarly, liposomes are another type of particle. Particles can be dyed with or conjugated to signal elements. Particles are often referred to with terms that reflect their dimensions or geometries. For example, the terms \nnanosphere, nanoparticle,\n or \nnanobead\n are used to refer to particles that measures less than 1 micron along any given axis. Similarly, the terms \nmicrosphere, microparticle\n, or \nmicrobead\n are used to refer to particles that measure less than one millimeter along any given axis. Examples of particles include latex particles, polyacrylamide particles, magnetite microparticles, ferrofluids (magnetic nanoparticles), quantum dots, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nlabeling particle\n is meant a particle that can specifically bind to target molecules and generate a signal. Labeling particles are conjugated to both signaling moieties and to category-binding molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \ntarget molecule:labeling particle complex\n is meant a labeling particle to which one or more target molecules are specifically bound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy labeling ratio is meant the ratio of target molecules to labeling particles during a contacting step. For example, if 1 × 10\n7\n labeling particles are contacted with a sample containing 1 × 10\n6\n target molecules, the labeling ratio is 10. For the purposes of calculating labeling ratios, only the target molecules that can specifically bind to labeling particles are considered. For example, target molecules that are physically inaccessible (\ne\n.\ng\n., sequestered in a cellular compartment) are not included in the calculation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nsignal character\n of a signal element or signal moiety is meant the aspect or aspects of a signal generated by the signal element signaling moiety that is useful for distinguishing it from other signal elements or signaling moieties. For example, the signal character of a signaling moiety labeled with fluorescein and rhodamine is fluorescence. The character of a radio transponder is \nradio frequency.\n Examples of photonic signaling character are fluorescence, light scattering, phosphorescence, reflectance, absorbance, chemiluminescence, and bioluminescence. All but the latter two examples of photonic signaling character depend on external illumination (\ne\n.\ng\n., a white light source, a laser light source, or daylight). In contrast, chemiluminescence and bioluminescence are signaling characters that are independent of external light sources.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy the \nclass\n of a signal element or signaling moiety is meant the distinct quality of the signal that is useful for distinguishing it from other signal elements or signaling moieties. For example, a liposome that is labeled with red dye is distinguished from differently colored liposomes. The color red is its class. For a micro-transmitter that broadcasts a particular radio-frequency signal, the quality of the radio-frequency signal that differentiates the micro-transmitter from other micro-transmitters constitutes the signal element class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nsignal signature\n is meant the distinctive signaling quality of the combination of signaling moieties that bind to a category of target molecules in a test. A target molecule that is bound to four types of antibodies, one of which is conjugated to a fluorescein molecule, and three of which are conjugated with rhodamine molecules has a signal signature that is described by the combined weighted absorbance and emission spectra of fluorescein and rhodamine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nsignal complexity\n of a test or an ensemble of labeled category-binding molecules is meant the number of categories of target molecules that can be distinctly labeled in the test or by binding to the ensemble. Alternatively, the signal complexity is defined as the number of distinct \nsignal signatures\n that would be expected to occur if a member of each category of target molecule were present. For some tests, the signal complexity of an ensemble of category-binding molecules is the same as the number of categories for which the test scans. Other tests, which scan for many categories, may only have a signal complexity of one.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nselection force\n is meant a force that is used to capture, isolate, move, or sequester target molecules. Examples of selection forces include gravity, magnetism, electrical potential, centrifugal force, centripetal force, buoyant density, and pressure. Target molecules can be mobilized by a selection force acting on the target molecule alone. Alternatively, selection forces can act specifically on target molecules that are associated with selection moieties (see definition below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of the application of selection forces to mobilize target molecules include centrifugation of target molecules; magnetic selection of target molecules bound to magnetic particles; gravitational sedimentation of target molecules labeled with metallic particles; and deposition of target molecules on a porous membrane by vacuum filtration. Further instances of the use of selection forces are included in the examples below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nselection moiety\n is meant an atom, molecule, particle, or other entity that can be conjugated to a category-binding molecule and that confers on the category-binding molecule the ability to be selectively captured, isolated, moved, or sequestered by a selection force. When a category-binding molecule:selective moiety complex is specifically bound to a target molecule, the target molecule can also generally be selectively captured, isolated, moved, or sequestered by the selection force. Selective refers to the preferential conferring of susceptibility to mobilization by the selection force on selection moieties and associated entities over entities not associated with selection moieties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParamagnetic particles and ferritin are examples of selection moieties. A dense silica particle that sinks in solution is another type of selection moiety. Such particles, when coated with category-binding molecules and bound to a microbial target molecule will cause the target molecule to sink in aqueous solution, thus enabling separation of the bound target molecule from other sample unbound constituents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nselective character\n is meant the aspect or aspects of a selection moiety that is useful for capturing, selecting, or moving the selection moiety. For example, the selective character of a paramagnetic particle is \nmagnetism.\n The selective character of a silica particle that rapidly sinks in aqueous solution is \nmass.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy a \nroughly planar\n surface or substrate is meant a surface that can be aligned in parallel to an imaginary plane such that when the distance is measured from points in any 1 mm × 1 mm square on the surface to the closest points on the imaginary plane, the absolute value of the mean distance is less than 50 micrometers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \ndetection surface\n is meant the surface of a roughly planar substrate onto which target molecules are deposited in some embodiments of the invention. In embodiments using photonic signaling character, if the detection surface is optically transparent, detection can be effected via either face of the detection surface. If the detection surface is opaque, detection is effected via the face of the detection surface on which the target molecules are deposited.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \ndetection area\n is meant the area of the detection surface or detection zone that is simultaneously analyzed by the invention. The detection area is typically greater than 1 mm, e.g., greater than 5 mm, 10 mm, or 15 mm, in its longest linear dimension. For example, the section of a glass slide that is simultaneously imaged by an optical device that includes a collection lens and a CCD chip might measure 0.8 cm × 0.5 cm. The detection area is then 0.4 cm\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \ndetection zone\n is meant the volume in which target molecules can be detected. The detection zone has the same dimensions as the detection area but has a depth corresponding to the depth in which a labeling particle can be detected and identified. The depth of the detection zone is therefore dependent on the threshold criteria used to score for positive signal. When optical detection is used, the depth of the detection zone is dependent on the optical depth of field.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy the \nlongest dimension\n of the detection area is meant the line of maximum length that can be drawn between two points on the perimeter of the detection area. For example, if the detection area is a rectangle measuring 0.3 cm × 0.4 cm, the longest dimension of the detection area is the diagonal, 0.5 cm. If the detection area is an ellipse with semi-major axis of length 7 mm and semi-minor axis of length 2.5 mm, the longest dimension of the detection area is 14 mm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nlarge area detection or large area imaging\n is meant a method for detecting microscopic target molecules in which the detection area (the area that is simultaneously analyzed by the detection device) is much larger than the target molecule. The detection area for large area detection has at least one linear dimension that is ≥ 1 mm. In contrast, the microscopic target molecules are substantially smaller, typically measuring less than 50 µm in at least two orthogonal dimensions. Examples of large area detection include imaging a 9 mm diameter detection area with a CCD camera; imaging a 2 cm × 1 cm rectangle by scanning with a CCD line scanner that has a long dimension of 1 cm; imaging a 4 cm × 4 cm filter containing microbial target molecules using direct exposure on photographic film; and visual detection of colored spots corresponding to microscopic target molecules on a 1 cm × 3c m test area in a rapid lateral flow strip test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral technologies scan samples for microscopic target molecules but do not exploit large area detection. Examples include: flow cytometry; solid phase laser microbeam scanning cytometry; liquid phase scanning (as in \nTibbe, et al., Nat Biotechnol 17: 1210-3, 1999\n); and examining/imaging multiple high power microscopic fields on a slide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nconjugated\n or \nstably associated\n is meant a physical association between two entities in which the mean half-life of association is least one day in PBS at 4°C. Consider, for example, the complex case of passive protein adsorption to polystyrene particles. There are several different classes of adsorbed proteins. Some proteins are stably associated to the surface with half-lives of many months. Other proteins, such as those that are loosely bound on the outer layer of adsorbed protein, may not be stably associated with the particles and can leach out within hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nimage intensifier\n or \nimage tube\n is meant a device that amplifies a photonic signal, as defined in the glossary of \nInoué, Shinya, et al., Video microscopy: the fundamentals (Plenum Press, New York, 1997; p. 665\n): \"A device coupled (by fiber optics or lenses) to a video camera tube to increase sensitivity. The intensifier is a vacuum tube with a photocathode on the front end that emits electrons according to the image focused upon it, an electron lens and/or microchannel plate(s) that focuses the electrons onto a phosphor at the back end, and a high voltage accelerator that increases the energy of the electrons. Can be single or multiple stage.\" A variety of such image intensifiers is described in detail in \nChapter\n 8 of the same reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nsimultaneously detecting\n target molecules in a section of the detection area is meant detection of the signal from a section of a roughly planar detection surface in one step. Large area imaging of target molecules in a detection area using a CCD chip, visual detection, or photodiode-based signal integration are examples of simultaneous detection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy target molecules in the \nstationary phase\n is meant target molecules that are non-mobile. For example, target molecules fixed on glass slides are in the stationary phase. Target molecules that are captured by category-binding molecules in fixed positions on the bottom of the well of a microtiter dish are in the stationary phase. Even if such target molecules are not affixed to a surface, and might be moved by hydrodynamic or other forces, target molecules are considered to be in the stationary phase if, during detection/imaging, successive images taken with intervals of more than 10 seconds detect essentially the same target molecules in essentially the same relative positions. Target molecules in flow cytometry applications are \nnot\n in the stationary phase. However, target molecules captured by antibodies bound to the solid-phase test zone of a lateral flow test \nare\n in the stationary phase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nhomogenous assay\n or \nhomogenous immunoassay\n is meant an assay or immunoassay in which the reactants are not physically removed from the products of the completed assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy identification is meant determining the category of which a target molecule is a member. For example, consider a lateral flow test that scans for several categories of target molecules, each of which is potentially present in a sample. A target molecule belonging to a particular category is captured at the region of the membrane to which the corresponding category-specific antibodies are bound. Since it is known which membrane zones contain which capture antibodies, target molecules are identified by the zone in which capture occurs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nsample\n is meant material that is scanned by the invention for the presence of target molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy a \nligation-dependent polymorphism probe pair\n is meant a set of oligonucleotide category-binding molecules (wherein the set contains more than one oligonucleotide) that, when hybridized to a genome, abut at a polymorphic site. One oligonucleotide in the pair comprises sequences that are complementary to the genomic sequences on one side of the genomic polymorphic site, while the other oligonucleotide comprises sequences that are complementary to the other side of the polymorphic site. A set of such oligonucleotides, when hybridized adjacently to a genome, can be efficiently ligated to each other only when the allele, or genotype, at the targeted site matches the abutting sequences of the oligonucleotides of the polymorphism probe. The structure and use of ligation-dependent polymorphism probe pairs is illustrated in \nFigure 18\n and \nFigure 19\n. Generally, a group of polymorphism probes is synthesized that correspond to each allele at a particular site. Polymorphism probes can comprise various functional moieties including, signaling moieties, selection moieties, chemical spacers or tethers, tags, amplification sites, and haptens. For examples of the use of SNP probes, see Example 14 and Example 15.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy an \nextension-dependent polymorphism probe\n is meant a nucleic acid category-binding molecule that is designed to hybridize to a sequence such that the 3' end of probe is within several nucleotides of but base-paired with the polymorphic site to be detected by a test. Template-dependent extension of the extension-dependent polymorphism probe is used to differentially label the probe depending on the allele at the polymorphic site. For example, consider an oligonucleotide designed to hybridize immediately adjacent to a polymorphic site that has either an \"A\" or a \"C\" on the template strand, such that the 3' end of the oligonucleotide is immediately adjacent to the polymorphic site. Incubating the hybrid with TTP that is labeled with a green emitting fluorophore and dGTP that is labeled with a red fluorophore in the presence of DNA polymerase under appropriate conditions can lead to differential labeling of the probe depending on the allele of the template strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nallele-specific hybridization probe\n is meant an oligonucleotide category-binding molecule that under specified conditions hybridizes differentially to different nucleic acid alleles. For example, those familiar with the art can determine conditions under which a 12 base oligonucleotide can efficiently hybridize to a DNA fragment that contains an exact match, but under which the same oligonucleotide can not efficiently hybridize to a DNA fragment with a match at 11 of the 12 bases in the oligonucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \ndirect visual detection is\n meant visual detection without the aid of instrumentation other than wearable corrective lenses. For example, direct visual detection can be used to detect the reddish reflective signal of nanogold particles in some rapid lateral flow tests.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nphotoelectric detector\n is meant a man-made device or instrument that transduces photonic signals into electric signals. Examples of photoelectric detectors include CCD detectors, photomultiplier tube detectors, and photodiode detectors, e.g., avalanche photodiodes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \nilluminating\n is meant irradiating with electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation of various wavelengths can be used to illuminate. It includes, for example, radiation with wavelengths in the X-ray, UV, visible, or infrared regions of the spectrum. Note that illuminating radiation is not necessarily in the visible range.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy signal elements or signaling moieties with \nphotonic signaling character\n is meant signal elements or signaling moieties that are detectable through the emission, reflection, scattering, refraction, absorption, capture, or redirection of photons, or any other modulation or combination of photon behavior. Some examples of signal elements or signaling moieties that have photonic signaling character include: the fluorophore Texas Red (fluorescent signaling character); CDP-Star (chemiluminescent signaling character); luciferase (bioluminescent signaling character); resonance light scattering particles (light scattering signaling character); BM purple (light absorption or chromogenic signaling character); and up-converting phosphors (absorption of two long wavelength photons and emission of one shorter wavelength photon).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \n'number'X 'solution name'\n is meant an aqueous solution comprising the constituents of the solution at \nnumber\n times the concentration of the solution (except for water). For example, 10X EE contains 10 mM EDTA/100 mM EPPS (EE, or 1X EE, contains 1 mM EDTA/10 mM EPPS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nEE\n is a solution that is 1 mM EDTA/10 mM EPPS.

The resulting complexes are bound to capture antibodies on the bottom of the well of a microtiter dish. Unbound labeling particles are removed. Upon illumination, the captured labeling particles fluoresce, emitting photons that impinge on the pixels of a CCD chip. The number and position of the labeling particles is interpreted by automated image analysis. The figure is simplified by not including the optical components and other hardware.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\n\n\n \nTesting a blood sample for a protein in a microtiter well format.\n The figure shows how imaging individual labeling particles is used to detect a target molecule, in this case a protein.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.\n\n\n\n\n \nA CCD imaging device for large area imaging.\n The CCD-based imager depicted in the figure was used to collect much of the data described in the examples (see also Step 6 of Detailed Description section). Excitation light is provided by introducing light from a high intensity white light source (1000 Watt Xenon arc lamp, Model A-6000, Photon Technology Incorporated, Monmouth Junction, NJ) into a liquid light-guide (5 mm core diameter, Model 380, Photon Technology Incorporated, Monmouth Junction, NJ). The liquid light-guide carries the light to an excitation filter-wheel (BioPoint FW, Ludl Electronics, Hawthorne, NY) and directs the filtered beam (typically 9 mm in diameter) onto the detection surface containing the labeled target molecules. The apparatus can detect labeled target molecules on various detection surfaces (\ne\n.\ng\n., porous membranes, microscope slides, microtiter dishes, coverslips, and tubes with flat, optically clear, bottoms). The incident light strikes the detection surface inducing fluorescence in the signaling moieties that are bound to target molecules via category-binding molecules and that are deposited on the optically clear surface. A portion of the emitted fluorescent light is collected by a high-collection efficiency lens system and transmitted through an emission filter-wheel (BioPoint FW, Ludl Electronics) to a CCD camera (Orca II, Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.\n\n\n\n\n \nA CCD imaging system for non-magnified large area imaging\n The figure shows a CCD imager with an angular illumination configuration in which light is introduced onto the detection surface (shown here as the bottom of a well of a microtiter plate) at an angle from the side of the collection optics. The angle is chosen to optimize collection efficiency and to avoid obstruction of the incident beam by the collection lens. The advantage of this configuration is that reflections from the bottom surface of the sample holder are not collected by the collection lens and therefore do not contribute to the fluorescence background noise.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.\n\n\n\n\n \nDetecting individual microscopic labeling particles without magnification using electronic, instant film, and unaided visual detection (Example 1)\n \n\nThis figure demonstrates the invention's ability to detect individual microscopic labeling particles in a large detection area \nwithout magnification\n using a variety of detection methods. Individual labeling particles coated with alkaline phosphatase were detected using instant film, a CCD camera, and unaided visual detection. The same colored spots that were visible by eye are shown in the central panels in an image that was acquired using a digital camera.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.\n\n\n\n\n \nAn ultra-sensitive lateral flow test for detecting low numbers of bacteria using non-magnified large area imaging (Example 2)\n \n\nThe figure shows the results of an ultra-sensitive lateral flow test using non-magnified large area imaging. Images of the capture and control lines are shown from various test strips with different numbers of \nE. coli\n added to the assay. The bar graph illustrates that as the number of \nE. coli\n increase, the signal from the capture line also increased. This figure demonstrates the ability to detect low numbers of bacteria in a sample.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.\n\n\n\n\n \nAn ultra-sensitive lateral flow test for detecting low levels of protein using non-magnified large area imaging (Example 3)\n \n\nThe figure shows the results of an ultra-sensitive test for the cytokine protein IL-2 using lateral flow format and non-magnified large area imaging. In the figure, capture and control lines images are seen from various test strips with different concentrations of IL-2 added to the assay. The bar graph illustrates that as the number of IL-2 increase, the signal from the capture line also increased. This figure demonstrates the ability to detect low levels of protein in a sample.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.\n\n\n\n\n \nUltra-sensitive lateral flow test for detecting low levels of protein in serum using non-magnified large area imaging (Example 4)\n \n\nThe figure shows the results of the lateral flow test for IL-2 in serum. In the figure, capture and control lines images are seen from representative test strips. The leftmost strip shows the negative control. When the negative control is compared to the middle (20 pg/ml) and right (200 pg/ml) strips, it is apparent that as the amount of IL-2 increases, the signal from the capture line also increased. The bottom bar graph shows the signal from the average of five replicates in relation to the amount of IL-2 added. The error bars represent a three standard deviation error between the replicate signals. The data shows that the invention can detect IL-2 at 20 pg/ml of serum demonstrating that the assay detects very low levels of a target protein even in a complex sample.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.\n\n\n\n\n \nUltra-sensitive lateral flow test for multiplex detection of a protein and a bacterium using non-magnified large area imaging (Example 5)\n \n\nThe figure shows the results of a multiplexed lateral flow test using non-magnified large area imaging. The figure shows images of the capture and control lines from test strips onto which were applied samples containing (from left to right) both \nE. coli\n and IL-2, \nE\n. \ncoli\n alone, IL-2 alone, and neither \nE\n. \ncoli\n nor IL-2. This figure demonstrates the sensitive lateral flow test and can detect multiple target molecules in the same assay.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.\n\n\n\n\n \nUltra-sensitive chemiluminescent lateral flow test for detecting low levels of protein using instant film (Example 7)\n The figure shows the results of a lateral flow test using chemiluminescent labeling particles and instant film detection. Capture and control lines from representative test strips are shown. A comparison of the strips onto which were applied samples containing IL-2 (from left to right: 0, 20, 200, and 2000 pg/ml) indicates that as the amount of IL-2 increased, the signal from the capture line also increased. The data show that the invention can detect IL-2 at concentrations as low as 20 pg/ ml using instant film. Thus, this test is ultra-sensitive, rapid, easy to perform, and very inexpensive.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.\n\n\n\n\n \nSchematic of a test device that uses capture threads to select target molecule:labeling particle complexes (Example 8)\n The figure shows the construction of the device used in this example. The sample is loaded into the sample zone where it flows laterally into the conjugate pad. The sample, drawn by the absorbent pad at the distal end of the apparatus, solubilizes and mobilizes the detection beads, which flow through the assay threads.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.\n\n\n\n\n \nAn ultra-sensitive test for a protein using the capture thread format (Example 8)\n \n\nThe figure shows the results of a capture thread test. The figure shows images of the capture and control threads from tests applied to samples containing IL-2 (0, 20, and 200 pg/ml). The results indicate that the test can detect IL-2 at 20 pg/ml. Furthermore, the concentration dependent speckled appearance of the capture threads suggests that individual labeling particles are being imaged.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.\n\n\n\n\n \nSensitive detection of protein molecules using non-magnified large area imaging and solid-phase capture immunoassay (Example 9)\n \n\nThe figure shows the results of a test that scans a sample for the human protein cytokine IL-2 using antibodies bound to the solid-phase to capture the protein. The wells of a micro titer plate were coated with anti-IL-2 antibodies. Dilutions of an IL-2 standard were added to the wells. After an hour of incubation all unbound particles were washed away and anti-IL-2 coated fluorescent particles were added to the wells. After washing, the bound particles were visualized without magnification in the CCD Imager. The negative control (anti-adenovirus particle panel) shows very few particles remain in the well. In the IL-2 panels, an increase in signal is seen as the concentrations of IL-2 standard increases. Signal is due to the interactions of the anti-IL-2 coated wells, the IL-2, and the anti-IL-2 coated particles. The graph shows the sensitivity (defined as two standard deviations above and below the average negative control) of the assay and where the IL-2 concentrations fall in relationships to the sensitivity.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.\n\n\n\n\n \nSensitive detection of protein molecules using non-magnified large area imaging and liquid-phase capture (Example 10)\n \n\nThe figure shows the results of a test that scans a sample for the human protein cytokine IL-2 using a \"dual bead\" liquid-phase sandwich method. Dilutions of an IL-2 standard were mixed with anti-IL-2 coated magnetic and fluorescent particles. After incubating 2 hours, the magnetic particles and any bound particles were separated from the other materials, transferred to a micro titer plate, and visualized without magnification in the CCD Imager. The negative control (no IL-2 particle panel) shows few particles remain in the well. In the IL-2 panels, an increase in signal is seen as the concentrations of IL-2 standard increases. The IL-2 panel shows thousands of anti-IL-2 coated fluorescent particles captured by the magnetic particles because of their interaction with IL-2. The graph shows the sensitivity (defined as two standard deviations above the average negative control) of the assay and where the IL-2 concentrations fall in relationship to the sensitivity.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.\n\n\n\n\n \nImmunoassay for detecting multiple human cytokines using non-magnified large area imaging (Example 11)\n \n\nThe figure shows an immunoassay strategy for ultra-sensitive detection of multiple proteins in a microtiter dish.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.\n\n\n\n\n \nCompetitive immunoassay for total (bound plus free) cytokine IL-2 using non-magnified large area imaging (Example 12)\n \n\nThis figure diagrams a scheme for a competitive immunoassay. A microtiter dish well is coated with an anti-IL-2 capture antibody that binds to an epitope that is exposed in both the free and bound forms of the cytokine. The sample is mixed with an IL-2:biotin conjugate that competes with the cytokine in the sample for binding to the capture antibodies. A streptavidin-coated fluorescent particle, which binds to the IL-2:biotin conjugate, is also included in the mixture. The fluorescent particles bind to the well to the extent that the conjugate competes for the capture antibody sites with cytokine in the sample. Thus, the number of fluorescent particles that are bound reflects the concentration of total cytokine in the sample. Non-magnified large area imaging of the bottom of the well quantifies the extent to which the fluorescent particles bind to the capture antibodies.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.\n\n\n\n\n \nSensitive detection of nucleic acid molecules using a dipstick format and non-magnified large area imaging (Example 13)\n \n\nThe figure shows the results of an assay that detects viral DNA using a dipstick format and non-magnified large area imaging. Dilutions of biotinylated viral DNA were spotted onto a nylon membrane. As a negative control, non-biotinylated viral DNA was also spotted. After blocking to prevent non-specific binding, the membrane strip was dipped into a solution containing avidin-coated red fluorescent beads. The bead solution migrated up the membrane by capillary action and contacted, in the process, the filter-bound DNA. The membrane was washed and then analyzed by CCD-based non-magnified large area imaging. The bright spots in the images in the figure indicate fluorescent signal obtained from the various DNA spots on a single membrane strip. The number of copies of DNA in each spot is indicated to the right of each image. The cartoon on the left shows how the DNA spots were positioned on the dipstick.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.\n\n\n\n\n \nNon-amplified multiplex SNP analysis using a lateral flow format and non-magnified large area imaging: Oligonucleotide ligation and sample application\n \n\nThis figure diagrams the first steps of the test described in Example 15, the final steps of the test are shown in \nFigure 19\n. Pairs of allele-specific oligonucleotides are hybridized to genomic DNA. One pair member is biotinylated (oligonucleotides with yellow triangles in the figure). The other pair member has a terminal nucleotide that corresponds to a single-nucleotide polymorphism and has a unique polymorphism-specific oligonucleotide tag (oligonucleotides with an explicit base - A, T, G, or\n\nC - in the figure). After ligation, the oligonucleotides are applied to a lateral flow chromatography strip. The oligonucleotide tag sequences hybridize to the tag complements that are arrayed in stripes on the lateral flow membrane. Only the tag sequences that correspond to polymorphisms present in the genomic DNA are ligated to biotinylated oligonucleotides. Therefore, only the stripes of tag complements corresponding to polymorphisms in the genomic DNA sample will hybridize to biotinylated oligonucleotides.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.\n\n\n\n\n \nNon-amplified multiplex SNP analysis using a lateral flow format and non-magnified large area imaging: Detection\n \n\nThis figure diagrams the final steps of the test described in Example 15, the first steps of the test are shown in \nFigure 18\n. As shown in \nFigure 18\n, after lateral flow chromatography, biotin molecules will be associated with stripes on the membrane containing tags that correspond to the genotype of the genomic DNA sample. This pattern of stripes is detected by binding to particles that are co-coated with streptavidin (which binds to the biotin moieties) and alkaline phosphatase. After adding a substrate of alkaline phosphatase that yields a chemiluminescent product, the stripes containing biotinylated oligonucleotides are detected with a CCD imager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Description of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOverview of the invention. The invention rapidly and cost-effectively scans a minimally processed sample for low levels of target molecules. The powerful features offered by the invention arise from a novel diagnostic approach that combines modern high-intensity labeling, cost-effective imaging technology, and non-magnified large-area detection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of non-magnified imaging to detect a small number of microscopic labels spread out over a large area is shown schematically in \nFigure 1\n. The embodiment depicted in \nFigure 1\n uses a digital camera (CCD chip) to capture an image of an area that is much larger than the individual labeling particle. The CCD chip comprises an array of photosensitive pixel elements. Light from a \"glowing\" particle at one position in the detection area impinges on pixel elements at the corresponding position of the CCD chip. The end-user receives information about the number of particles in the sample from a computer that processes the image data (\ni\n.\ne\n., the number and intensities of the illuminated pixels) acquired from the CCD chip.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to understand the principles used by the invention better, it is helpful to consider a specific embodiment. \nFigure 1\n diagrams a method that quantifies the amount of the human protein cytokine IL-2 in a blood sample. The well of a microtiter dish with an optically clear base is coated with an antibody that binds to a site on the IL-2 molecule. A drop of blood containing IL-2 molecules is added to the well. Fluorescent particles (dyed with the molecule fluorescein) are also added to the well. These particles are also coated with an antibody that specifically binds to IL-2 (although this antibody binds to a site that is distinct from the site to which the capture antibody binds). The IL-2 molecules in the blood bind to both the fluorescent beads and the capture antibody forming a \"sandwich\" on the bottom of the well. The result of sandwich formation is that fluorescent beads become anchored to the bottom of the well. When no IL-2 is present, no sandwiches are formed, and no fluorescent beads become anchored to the bottom of the well. The more IL-2 there is in the blood, the more beads become coated with IL-2, and the more beads become anchored to the bottom of the well. The next steps image and enumerate these beads.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIlluminating the bottom of the well (the detection area) with light in the excitation range of fluorescein elicits fluorescence emission by the fluorescent beads that are anchored to the bottom of the well. The fluorescent image of the particles is collected, focusing the emitted light on the surface of a CCD chip without magnification. Fluorescent light from each particle impinges on one pixel or a small cluster of pixels causing a localized electronic signal that is relayed from the CCD chip to a computer where it can be stored in the form of an image file. Image analysis software enumerates the number of beads anchored to the bottom of the well by counting the number of pixel clusters responding to light from the particles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention can be used to construct tests using a number of types of formats, labeling methods, category-binding molecules, and detection methods. However, the tests have several key features in common. The steps and processes that are common to many embodiments of the invention are described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nThe general methods of the invention include the following steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormulating a test question, choosing a sample, test format, and category-binding molecule(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing labeling particles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding target molecules in the sample to the labeling particles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting or capturing target molecule:labeling particle complexes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying and quantifying target molecules present in the sample by detecting the selected or captured target molecule:labeling particle complexes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 1: Formulating a test question, choosing a sample, test format, and category-binding molecule(s)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFormulating the question to be answered by the test is the first step in creating a new detection method based on the invention. Some examples of important questions that industrial and clinical microbiologists must address are listed in Table 2. Articulating the test question generally defines the sample type that must be tested (\ne\n.\ng\n., environmental water, urine, or a pharmaceutical finished product). The sample type and volume are important parameters in choosing the test format.\n\n \n \nTable 2.\n \n \n \n \n \nExamples of questions answered by tests based on the invention\n \n \n \n \n \n• Does the environmental sample contain any of 6 particular biowarfare agents?\n \n \n \n• What is the total viral content of an environmental sample?\n \n \n \n• Does the blood of this patient contain levels of 4 specified proteins that are markers of sepsis?\n \n \n \n• Does the saliva of this patient contain any of 12 specified drugs-of-abuse?\n \n \n \n• What level of pharmaceutical drug X is in the blood of this patient in a clinical trial?\n \n \n \n• Are any of four specified foodborne pathogens or 2 toxins present in this food product?\n \n \n \n• Does a cervical sample contain any of 5 specified sexually transmitted disease pathogens?\n \n \n \n• Does the blood of a patient contain any of a panel of 12 proteins correlated with heart disease?\n \n \n \n• Does the blood of a patient contain any of a panel of 12 proteins correlated with breast cancer?\n \n \n \n• Does the DNA of a patient have any of 12 alleles that are correlated with cardiovascular disease?\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe test format is chosen based on several factors including the sample volume, sample content (\ni.e\n., are there particulates or cells?), number of categories of targets, operator skill level, cost constraints. Examples include familiar lateral flow and microtiter dish formats in addition to novel formats. A range of formats are outlined in the examples below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHaving formulated the test question, the categories of target molecules become clear. These are the molecules detected by the test. For tests that survey a sample for a panel of small molecules (\ne\n.\ng\n., drugs-of-abuse) or for protein markers of cardiovascular disease the target molecule molecules are simply the drugs-of-abuse or the protein markers, respectively. For tests that survey a sample for more complex targets (such as a bacterial pathogen or white blood cells containing proteins correlated with leukemia), the target molecules are molecules that are characteristic or specific to the target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the categories of target molecules become clear, category-binding molecules are chosen. Category-binding molecules bind specifically to the target molecules. The invention supports a wide variety of category-binding molecules which are appropriate for different target molecules. For example, antibodies can be used as the category-binding molecules for a variety of target molecules (\ne\n.\ng\n., hormones, carbohydrates, and proteins). For determining the genetic makeup of an individual, DNA oligonucleotides may be used, for example.\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 2: Preparing labeling particles\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention's ability to detect individual microscopic target molecules without optical magnification or expensive instrumentation depends on specifically labeling the target molecules at high signal intensity. Labeling is achieved by specifically binding labeling particles to the target molecules via an association with category-binding molecules. The labeling particles have two functionalities: signal generation and specific binding. Various particle compositions, signal generating moieties, and category-binding molecules can be used to make labeling particles with these functions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo make labeling particles that bind to the target molecules chosen in \nStep\n 1, category-binding molecules are conjugated to particles using various methods which are known by those familiar with the art (see, for example, \nHermanson, G., Bioconjugate Techniques (Academic Press, 1996\n) and specific examples below). Sometimes signaling moieties are conjugated to the particles using the same set of conjugation techniques (\ne\n.\ng\n., for enzymatic signaling moieties).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous types of signaling moieties are used to allow the particles to emit strong signals of the appropriate type for a given test. For example, microparticles, such as polystyrene beads (\ne\n.\ng\n., 1 micron diameter) can be dyed with fluorescent dyes to create intensely fluorescent particles. Fluorescently dyed polystyrene microparticles (\ne\n.\ng\n., 1 µm in diameter) can incorporate millions of fluorophore signaling elements. Alternatively, particles can be conjugated to enzymatic signaling moieties such as alkaline phosphatase, which can catalyze the formation of fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or visibly colored products. Other types of labeling particles include quantum dots and resonance light scattering particles. These small particles can also be complexed with larger particles to increase the signal strength and signal complexity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention's ability to scan simultaneously for numerous disparate categories of target molecules stems from the ability to differentiate the signals derived from the different categories of target molecules. The invention discriminates between categories of target molecules in two general ways. One method, called signal differentiation, labels each category-specific family of category-binding molecules with signaling moieties such that it has a unique \nsignal signature\n. The ability to generate and detect large numbers of distinct signal signatures (\ni\n.\ne\n., high \nsignal complexities\n) enables the construction of tests that scan for numerous categories of target molecules (\ni.e\n., highly multiplexed tests). Another method for distinguishing between multiple categories of target molecules, geometric differentiation, relies on depositing different categories of target molecules in different regions of the detection area. Geometric differentiation, which can be independent of the signal signature of signaling moieties, is used, for example, in multiplexed lateral flow tests. Geometric differentiation is discussed in \nStep\n 4 below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention can exploit various types of \nsignal character\n including fluorescence, scattered light, light polarization, thermal radiation, chemiluminescence, and radioactivity. Examples of signaling moieties and detection schemes using various signal characters appear below. There can be multiple signal classes within a signal character. For example, if the signal character is fluorescence, various characteristic emission spectra comprise the signal classes (\ne\n.\ng\n., red fluorescence, green fluorescence, and blue fluorescence). Alternatively, red fluorescent microparticles that are dyed with different concentrations of the same fluorophore also employ fluorescence as the signal character, but in this case, the different intensities of the particles constitute the classes of signal character, \ni.e\n., fluorescence intensity is the quality of the signal character that differentiates one group of particles from another.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAttaining a high \nsignal complexity\n is key to developing certain tests that scan for numerous types of target molecules (\ni\n.\ne.\n, tests with high \ncategorical complexity\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAchieving high signal complexity. The number of distinguishable labels (or signaling moieties) in a mixture is called the \nsignal complexity.\n For highly multiplexed tests, it is sometimes advantageous to use signaling moieties with high signal complexity. Three general approaches that can be used with this invention to generate high signal complexity are: (\n \n1\n \n) distinct labeling, (\n \n2\n \n) combinatorial labeling, and (\n \n3\n \n) ratio labeling.\n\n \n \n \n1. For distinct labeling, probes in different probe families are tagged with a single signaling moiety that can be readily detected in the presence of all other signaling moieties in the experiment. Thus far, it has been difficult to achieve distinct labeling at high signal complexities. This difficulty occurs because most labeling methods use optical signals (\ne\n.\ng\n., chromogenic, fluorescent, or chemiluminescent) or radioactive labeling. Because of the spectral bandwidth of optical signals and the limited range of signals detectable by current instruments, the resolvable signal complexity using optical signals is rather small. For example, the resolution of dozens of fluorophores with distinct emission spectra is currently impossible because of spectral overlap,. One method that can be used for distinct labeling is the use of micro-transponders (\ne\n.\ng\n., \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,001,571\n \n). Each micro-transponder emits a distinct radio wave signature. Thus, labeling with micro transponders and other as yet developed methods for distinct labeling have the potential to be used in conjunction with the invention.\n \n2. Another way to achieve the high signal complexity used in the invention is to apply a combinatorial labeling approach. Combinatorial labeling is a technique for achieving high signal complexity using a relatively small number of distinct signaling moieties. With this approach, distinct \ncombinations\n of signaling moieties are bound to different targets. Currently, fluorophores are a favored class of signal moiety for molecular diagnostics. However, given the complications involved in analyzing multiple distinct fluorophores (arising in large part from overlap of the excitation and emission spectra), it is only currently practical to incorporate about seven or fewer conventional fluorophores. Used in combination, seven fluorophores can be used to generate 127 distinct signals (N fluorophores generate 2\nN\n - 1 combinations). High signal complexity can also be achieved via combinatorial labeling using other types of signaling moieties. For example, particles impregnated with different dyes, particles that fall into different discrete size classes, or transponders emitting distinct radio signals could be used with this approach. Combinatorial labeling using fluorophores has recently been applied with success for human karyotyping (Speicher \net al\n 1996, \nsupra\n; Schröck \net al\n 1996, \nsupra\n). Instrumentation and software for analysis of combinatorial labeling experiments is commercially available.\n \n3. High signal complexity can also be obtained using the ratio labeling approach (Fulton, \net al\n 1997, \nsupra\n). In ratio labeling, as in combinatorial labeling, many distinct types of signaling moieties are generated using a relatively small number of distinct signaling elements. In contrast to combinatorial labeling, the signaling moieties in ratio labeling are distinguished by the ratio of the signaling elements. For example, two fluorophores, X and Y, with different excitation/emission characteristics can be used to dye polystyrene particles. Different relative concentrations of the fluorophores ([X], [Y]) are applied to different sets of particles. For example, eight different concentrations of X and eight different concentrations of Y can be used to dye particles in all combinations (X\n1\nY\n1\n, X\n1\nY\n2\n, X\n8\nY\n7\n, X\n8\nY\n8\n) resulting in 64 classes of distinguishable particles. Ratio labeling simplifies instrumentation, as only a small number of signal types need be used. Signal elements, other than fluorophores and including non-optical signal elements, can also be used to generate high signal complexities using a ratio labeling approach.\n \n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Binding target molecules in the sample to the labeling particles\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe method and format for binding the target molecules in the sample to the labeling particles depends on the type of sample, the nature of the target molecules, and the chosen format of the test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn important attribute of the invention is its compatibility with rapid and simple sample preparation protocols. For many applications, in fact, there is no required sample preparation. This represents a major advantage over other sensitive diagnostic methods, such as nucleic acid amplification-based techniques, which require much more demanding sample preparation procedures to eliminate enzyme inhibitors. Tests that survey samples for soluble molecular markers, for example, often do not require any sample preparation before binding to the labeling particles. For some tests, in which the target molecule is part of a larger complex or sequestered in a larger complex, the larger complex can be dissociated as part of the sample preparation step. For example, for a test that surveys for the presence of viral core protein on the interior the HIV virus, the virus particle could be dissociated using a detergent. Similarly, for genetic analysis, cells containing the nucleic acid target molecules are generally broken open (\ne\n.\ng\n., by various chemical or physical treatments) and the double stranded DNA denatured to allow for nucleic acid hybridization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious formats used by the invention have the advantage of allowing rapid binding of the labeling particles to the target molecules in the sample. For example, contacting large numbers of labeling particles and target molecules in liquid samples forces collisions to occur much more rapidly than in typical ELISA formats, in which the target molecules typically diffuse to one end of the reaction chamber before collision can occur. Rapid binding kinetics are also a feature of test formats (\ne\n.\ng\n., lateral flow tests) in which contacting occurs inside a porous membrane\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 4: Selecting or capturing target molecule:labeling particle complexes\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe selection step has several important functions including separating the target molecule:labeling particle complexes from unbound labeling particles, depositing the target molecule:labeling particle complexes in the detection zone (\ne\n.\ng\n., the focal plane of the optical system for some embodiments) removing the sample material from the target molecule:labeling particle complexes, and (for some test formats) localizing specific categories of labeled target molecules to distinct regions of the detection area.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor assays in which the sample is fixed to a solid substrate before the binding step, the unbound category-binding molecules and signaling moieties are generally removed by washing. Examples include applications that use \nin situ\n hybridization and immunocytochemical methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther test formats are carried out in the liquid phase, for example in microtiter wells. For some tests the selection step occurs via binding of the target molecule:labeling particle complexes to capture molecules on the detection surface of a microtiter well. In these tests, diffusion is the means by which the contact is made with the capture molecules. For other applications, the target molecule/category-binding molecule/signaling moiety complexes are deposited on the surface. Methods for depositing the target molecule complexes on a surface include centrifugation, filtration, gravitational settling, magnetic selection, or binding to surface bound category-binding molecules, \ne\n.\ng\n., capture antibodies. In some cases (\ne\n.\ng\n., magnetic separation), a distinct moiety, the selection moiety, is used. Magnetic microparticles coated with category-specific antibodies are an example of a selection moiety. The unbound category-binding molecules and signaling moieties generally remain in the liquid phase and can be removed. However, if the detection procedure (\ne\n.\ng\n., optical imaging) selectively analyzes the solid surface with a narrow depth of field, the unbound material (lying outside of the plane of focus) sometimes need not be removed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some applications, combinations of selection procedures are useful. For example, the sample can be filtered through membranes with defined pore sizes before contacting the labeling particles. For example, a filter system that only lets particles between about 0.5 and 5 microns in size could be used to detect the presence of anonymous bacteria. Such a test could be based on a labeling particle that binds to \nany\n protein that contains a tyrosine, for example. Selecting for other size ranges could enable tests for anonymous viruses, free proteins, or eukaryotic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLateral-flow and flow-through formats are arguably the most successful test formats in point-of-care testing. These formats exploit the advantages of capillary flow in bibulous membranes. They generally select the target molecule:labeling particle complexes using capture molecules (\ni.e\n., surface-bound category-binding molecules). Unbound labeling particles flow out of the capture zone by capillary action. Another important advantage of membrane-based assays is the ease of multiplexing by using geometric differentiation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeometric differentiation is an important method when surveying samples for multiple categories of target molecules (\ni\n.\ne\n., in multiplexed tests). Geometric differentiation has the advantage, when compared to high signal complexity multiplexed tests (see Step 2), of requiring only a single signal signature for multiplexed tests. In a typical immunoassay that uses geometric differentiation, different category-specific capture antibodies are deposited in distinct areas in the detection zone (\ne\n.\ng\n., different stripes in a lateral flow test or different spots in a flow through or microtiter well-based test). Thus, different categories of target molecules are captured in different pre-determined areas of the capture zone. Other types of capturing moieties that are analogous to capture antibodies include antigens, ligands, and nucleic acids. Other formats, including those using microfluidic channels and those using \"capture threads\" (thin strips of material coated with capture molecules) can also be used with geometrical differentiation.\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 5: Identifying and quantifying target molecules present in the sample by detecting the selected or captured target molecule:labeling particle complexes\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis step detects, identifies, and quantifies target molecules in the sample using large area imaging analysis of the target molecule:labeling particle complexes that are anchored in the detection zone. The step itself generally comprises the steps of imaging, image analysis, and report generation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention can detect \nmicroscopic\n labeling particles with \nno magnification.\n This powerful feature is supported by high intensity labeling methods and high efficiency optics to direct photons emitted by the microcolony into a small number of pixels of photodetector arrays. Low magnification imaging facilitates the imaging of a large area which, in turn, facilitates scanning large samples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe imaging method used depends on the type of signal generation chosen in \nstep\n 2. For example, the imaging process is different depending on the optical property or signaling character that is used for signal generation. For some signal characters (\ne\n.\ng\n., reflectance, fluorescence, light scattering, or absorbance), the complexes in the detection zone must be illuminated by a light source. For others (\ne\n.\ng\n., chemiluminescence or thermal radiation), illumination is not required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetection of individual labeling particles is naturally quantitative and ultra-sensitive. Quantification can be accomplished by manually counting individual labeling particles in a photographic or digital image or by using automated image analysis of digitized images. Integrating signal intensity over the sample can also be used to quantify the target cells. Signal integration is particularly useful with samples containing high concentrations of target cells. In these cases, resolving coincident signals may not always be possible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDecoding the signatures of the labeling particles allows identification of numerous categories of target cells. An important goal of this step is to identify the category of target cells in the sample by determining the signature of target molecule:labeling particle complexes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CCD camera-based imager, shown in \nFigure 1\n is a useful device for large area imaging when fluorescence is used as the signal character. This device was used to collect the data for many of the examples below. Excitation light is provided by introducing light from a high intensity white light source (1000 W Xenon arc lamp, Model A-6000, Photon Technology Incorporated, Monmouth Junction, NJ) into a liquid light-guide (5 mm core diameter, Model 380, Photon Technology Incorporated, Monmouth Junction, NJ). The liquid light-guide carries the light to an excitation filter-wheel (BioPoint FW, Ludl Electronics, Hawthorne, NY) and directs the filtered beam (\ne\n.\ng\n., 9 mm or more in diameter) onto the detection surface containing the labeling particles. The apparatus can detect labeling particles in various configurations (\ne\n.\ng\n., on (or in) porous membranes, microscope slides, coverslips, or tubes or wells with flat, optically clear, bottoms). The incident light strikes the detection surface inducing fluorescence in the target cells. A portion of the emitted fluorescent light is collected by a high-collection efficiency lens system and transmitted through an emission filter-wheel (BioPoint FW, Ludl Electronics) to a CCD camera (Orca II, Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ). The design and construction of the optical train is based on principles and practices known to workers familiar with the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention can also incorporate other types of photodetectors and other configurations. The sensitivity of the imaging system can be increased by choosing a more sensitive camera (e.g., a camera cooled to a lower temperature, or a camera that uses a back-thinned chip). Alternatively, the detection sensitivity and resolution can be increased by implementing a line scanning system (e.g., BT Image Array; Hamamatsu). For line scanning, a linear CCD or photodiode array (e.g. 1 × 500 or 1 × 1000 pixels) is used to capture the image. The resolution in one dimension corresponds to the number of array elements, while the second dimension is generally captured by moving the sample slide perpendicularly under the linear array. Since there are fewer elements, similar sensitive linear arrays are typically less expensive than area format CCD cameras.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe instrument diagrammed in \nFigure 3\n can be configured to measure multiple samples by using an X-Y positioning Stage (BioPoint XY, Ludl Electronics) to move the experimental samples over the excitation and collection optics. Image-Pro and Image-Pro add-ins control all instrument components and image acquisition. Filter wheels are managed with the ScopePro add-in (Media Cybernetics, Baltimore MD), and the StagePro add-in (Media Cybernetics, Baltimore MD) handles stage positioning, while the camera control is via the Hamamatsu Orca II driver (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ). Image-Pro Plus is also used for Image-Processing and analysis as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmbodiments of the invention using white light illumination utilize spectral filters to provide an optimal excitation peak for each of the fluorophores. The white light spectrum is large, allowing a wide variety of fluorophores to be selected to eliminate emission spectra overlaps. Typically spot sizes achievable with white light illuminators, e.g., 2 mm to 5 mm, are appropriate for large area imaging. Since filter changes are relatively simple and can be automated, white light systems are very adaptable, allowing the same apparatus to be used for tests that use distinct sets of fluorophores.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe collection efficiency of the system shown in \nFigure 3\n is maximized by incorporating a custom designed collection optic consisting of two components: a collection objective and a focusing element. The collection objective has high collection efficiency (≥ f#/1.2) and outputs a relatively collimated beam. The focusing lens captures the light output from the collection objective and focuses it onto the detection surface of the CCD. The optics are designed in two parts to allow a filter wheel to be inserted in the path of the collection lens. For certain embodiments of the invention, \ne\n.\ng\n., those that do not require filter changes, it may be desirable to include a tapered optical fiber bundle for achieving high collection efficiency. The fiber optic bundle contains fibers that collect light proximally to the sample and channel the light directly to a CCD chip. Alternatively, the invention can detect signals very sensitively using direct proximal detection in which the sample is applied directly or in close proximity to the CCD chip (for highest sensitivity to the back of a back-thinned CCD chip).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the white-light, multi-spectral system described above, we have also developed a simper single-color fluorescence imaging system for non-magnified large area imaging. In the system shown in \nFigure 4\n, excitation light is provided by a 532 nm Frequency-Doubled Diode Laser (50 mW, Model # BWT-50E, B&W Tek, Newark, DE). Since this detection uses a single color, filter wheels are not necessary. A single excitation filter removes harmonic spectra from the laser output (Model HQ532/10x, Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT), and a single emission filter (Model HQ620/60m, Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT) allows only specific wavelengths to pass to the CCD camera. This system may also use a less-expensive CCD camera (Model KX-2E, Apogee CCD, Auburn, CA) than the one described previously, to capture images. The instrument can easily be adapted to multicolor analysis by incorporating multiple lasers and filter sets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CCD cameras incorporated in the invention are generally cooled to a temperature between -5°C and -50°C, sufficient for integration times from ten seconds to about two minutes (depending on the camera sensitivity) with minimal camera noise build-up. Longer integration times generally give higher sensitivity by allowing the collection of the photons emitted from the fluorophores for an extended period. Long integration times are inappropriate for line scanning; however, there are back-thinned linear arrays available that have very high quantum efficiencies, increasing sensitivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention can also use interferometer-based spectral imaging for the detection and decoding of signals (Schrock, E., 1997, \nsupra\n). Using this technique, light emitted or scattered by signaling moieties is split into two paths, passed thorough prisms (so that different wavelengths travel different distances), and allowed to recombine to create an interference pattern. Fourier analysis of the interference pattern generates a spectrograph for each point in the image.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor point-of-care applications including applications requiring portable systems, the invention can be configured to minimize weight and size. For some embodiments, instrumentation can be eliminated completely (\ne\n.\ng\n., when the labeling particles are visualized by color detection) or greatly simplified (\ne\n.\ng\n., by using instant film in place of electronic detectors). If desired, images collected on film can be digitized in commercial scanners for data storage and for digital image analysis. Alternatively, photodetectors can be used without an optical system by using proximal imaging (the photodetector is placed essentially against the detection zone). For maximum portability, the light source can be eliminated by using labeling particles with non-illumination dependent signaling character (\ne\n.\ng\n., chemiluminescence).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor embodiments of the invention that generate digital images, computer software identifies and quantifies the target labeling particles. For a typical assay in which different classes of fluorescent signaling moieties are used, the software superimposes the appropriate fluorophore-specific images, identifies the target cells by determining which signature or combination of signals is emitted by each target labeling particle, and enumerates each category of target labeling particle that is present in the sample. The software may also: (1) correct for illumination non-uniformity; (2) correct for fluorescence cross-talk through a deconvolution matrix; (3) align images using registration marks, e.g., imprinted on the substrate; (4) assign an ID code to each imaged labeling particle in the sample based on comparison to a look up table; (5) record the imaged sample bar code for sample identification; and (6) automatically save output data, images, and bar code to a database that can be queried, e.g., via a web browser interface. Commercially available image analysis packages can be used to provide these functions. Software packages for multicolor image analysis can be used (e.g., Image-Pro, Media Cybernetics; MetaMorph, Universal Imaging; MatLab; The MathWorks).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is useful to outline here the software packages and methods that were used to analyze the fluorescence data collected in many of the examples that follow. The detection surface is imaged to determine the number of fluorescent objects and/or the total fluorescent signal. The fluorescence was captured from the detection zones by a CCD camera and stored as a TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image file that contains records of pixel locations and intensities. Three approaches were used to quantify the assay results. The total integrated signal of the imaged detection zone was determined by summing the fluorescent signal from all of the pixels. The integrated signal from the sample was compared to that of negative controls. Measuring the total integrated signal is especially useful for samples containing numerous target molecules. A second approach was to count the fluorescent objects in the detection zone. A third approach was to integrate the intensity of all of the pixels contained within the fluorescent objects (as opposed to summing the intensity of all of the pixels in the image). All image analysis was performed using Image-Pro v 4.0 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Springs, MD).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing the IPP Image-Pro macro language, the above utilities can be automated to allow batch processing of several images at one time. In addition, the data can be manipulated with other user-defined IPP scripts. For example, objects below or above a certain size (area) or intensity can be included or excluded, which can be a useful tool for dust exclusion. Other important parameters for image analysis that determine object definition (\ne\n.\ng\n., acceptance and rejection criteria) vary by application and should be optimized accordingly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious aspects of the invention can be automated including linking the steps outlined above. Consider an application for analyzing liquid samples such as pharmaceutical water for injection or a clinical urine sample. Such an automated system could automatically collect samples, contact them with labeling particles, apply a selection step, obtain an image, analyze the image, and report the results. Alternatively, individual functions of the invention can be automated. For example, modules for automatically loading and unloading vessels into the imaging instrument and for automatic focusing can be incorporated into the system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples. The examples below provide technical details for implementing various embodiments of the invention for use in conjunction with a range of applications and are not intended to be limiting.\n\n\n \nExample 1. Detecting individual microscopic labeling particles without magnification using electronic, instant film, and unaided visual detection\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBackground and objectives:\n The invention's ability to quantify low levels of target molecules rests, in part, in its ability to detect and enumerate \nindividual\n microscopic target molecules in large detection areas without the use of high magnification. The goal of this example is to demonstrate that the invention can accomplish this using various means for detection: a CCD photodetector array, instant film, and simple visual detection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe labeling particles for these experiments were latex particles that were coated with antibodies and the enzyme alkaline phosphatase. Beads placed on membranes were treated with either chemiluminogenic or chromogenic substrates of substrates of alkaline phosphatase that produce chemiluminescent or colored (purple) products, respectively. The membrane with the chemiluminescent labeling particles was imaged electronically or with instant film, and the membrane with the chromogenic labeling particles was imaged by eye.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExperimental Methods:\n Particles coated with antibodies and enzyme molecules were made by adding both biotinylated alkaline phosphatase (5 µl of a 2.9 mg/ml stock; Pierce; cat. num. 29339) and biotinylated goat anti-\nE\n. \ncoli O157\n antibody (5 µl of a 1.0 mg/ml stock; Kirkeguard and Perry Laboratories; cat. num. 01-95-90) to streptavidin-coated particles (10\n8\n particles; Bangs;0.95 um, non-fluorescent; cat. num. CP01 N). The volume was brought up to 100 µl with PBS. After a 30-minute incubation, the particles were washed twice. A wash consisted of spinning the particles down in a microcentrifuge at 3000 g for 5 minutes, then discarding the supernatant and resuspended the particles in PBS (100 µl). After making the dually coated particles, the beads were diluted to about 50 and 500 beads. Three replicates of each dilution as well as a no bead control were each added to PBS (50 ml) and filtered through a 0.2 µm pore nitrocellulose membrane using a vacuum pump and a plastic funnel cup (Millipore Microfil V User Guide, PF07114, \nRev A\n 3/00). BM Purple alkaline phosphatase substrate (500 µl; Roche; cat. num. 1442074) was added to one set of filters. The other filter set had CDP-star (500 µl; NEN; cat. num. NEL-601) added to them. After a 1-hour incubation the BM purple membranes were washed in water to remove left over BM Purple, and the membranes were allowed to air dry. The CDP-star membranes were mounted in a SpotLight camera (Boston Probes; cat. num. DT10000) according to the manufacturer's instructions and exposed to \nASA\n 2000 film (Boston Probes; cat. num. DT20000) for 2 minutes. The same filters were then observed using non-magnified large area imaging. Image-Pro Plus software, version 4.1 (Media cybernetics) was used to capture and process images from the CCD Imager.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nResults.\n \nFigure 5\n shows that the bi-functional particle, that was conjugated to a category-specific binding molecule and an enzymatic signaling moiety, can be detected using either chromogenic or chemiluminescent signal elements. The ability to see single labeling particles even with the naked eye is due to the large numbers of enzyme molecules on each labeling particle. The example demonstrates the potential for the invention to provide ultra-sensitive point-of-care tests that are simple, user-friendly, cost-effective, and non-instrumented.\n\n\n \nExample 2. Detecting low numbers of bacteria using non-magnified large area imaging\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBackground and objectives:\n This example demonstrates the use of the invention to detect low numbers of bacteria rapidly using a user-friendly lateral flow assay format and non-magnified large area imaging. Lateral flow assays have been used in the diagnostic industry for over 20 years. These simple assays rely on antigen:antibody interactions to detect the presence of a specific target (or analyte). The lateral flow strips, although simple, lack the sensitivity to compete, in most diagnostic areas, with ELISA immunoassays and nucleic acid amplification methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the example, various dilutions of bacterial lysates (\nE. coli\n O157:H7) were applied to porous membrane strips that contained a conjugate pad containing labeling particles (fluorescently dyed latex particles coated with \nE\n. \ncoli\n O157:H7-specific antibodies), a line of capture antibodies, and a positive control line with capture antibodies that bind to labeling particles lacking target molecules. After performing the test, the capture and control lines were imaged using large area non-magnified imaging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExperimental Methods:\n The lateral flow test strips were assembled by following the directions supplied in the lateral flow kit (Millipore; High Flow Mid Range Assembly Kit, cat. no. HFMIDAK015). In short, wicking, conjugate, and sample pads were placed onto a lateral flow membrane, which was attached to an adhesive support card. Antibody lines were made by applying two lines of capture antibodies across the membrane strips: one for \nE. coli O157:H7\n (the capture line; 10µl of a 1 mg/ ml solution per 8 cm line, BioTrace affinity purified; Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, cat. no. 01-95-90) and one for a positive control (the control line; 10 µl of a 1 mg/ ml solution per 8 cm long line, Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc.; biotin anti-goat IgG, cat. no. 115-165-146) onto the membrane (5-10 mm from wicking pad). The lines were allowed to dry (at least 15 min) before use. Streptavidin labeled fluorescent beads (Bangs Laboratories Inc., cat. no. CP01 F-5121) were labeled with biotin anti-\nE\n. \ncoli O157:H7\n antibody (BioTrace affinity purified; Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, cat. no. 01-95-90) by combining the beads (10 µl of 1.23 × 10\n11\n/ml, antibody (10 µl of 1.0 µg/ml stock) and PBS (80 µl)) and mixing (1.5 hours/ room temp). The beads were then centrifuged (5000 g, 10 min) and resuspended in PBS-B (100 µl). The anti- \nE. coli\n coated fluorescent beads (2 µl) were added to the conjugate pad of each strip. A stock of formaldehyde fixed \nE. coli O157:H7\n cells (Strain DEC 3B, Dr. Tom Whittam, Pennsylvania State University, 10\n9\n cells/ ml) were serially diluted using PBS. The serial dilutions (100 µl) were then added to a lysing solution (100 µl of 200 mM NaOH/ 1% SDS) and allowed to sit for 3 min. PBS-B (800 µl) was added to neutralize the lysis solution. Test samples (100 µl of the lysed \nE. coli\n dilution) were combined with PBS-TB (50 µl) and added to the sample pad of the test strip. The sample moved through the sample pad to the conjugate pad, where the fluorescent beads were integrated into the sample flow. The sample then proceeded into the test membrane, through the capture and control line and finally into the wicking pad. After performing the assay, (∼15 minutes). The membranes were then imaged by placing the strips on a CCD-based imager (described in \nStep\n 5 of Detailed description section and shown in \nFigure 3\n) so that the bacteria were facing the illumination source and CCD chip. The strips were imaging using non-magnified large area imaging. The images were analyzed using Image-Pro software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nResults:\n \nFigure 6\n shows the results of the lateral flow test for detecting bacteria. The figure shows images of the capture and control lines from representative strips. The leftmost strip shows the results when a negative control sample containing no bacteria was analyzed. When the negative control is compared to the middle and right strip, containing 1000 and 10,000 \nE. coli\n respectively, it is apparent that as the number of bacteria increases, the signal from the capture line also increased. The bottom bar graph shows the signal from the average of five replicates in relation to the number of \nE. coli\n added. The error bars represent a three standard deviation error between the replicate signals. The data shows a detection limit of 1000 bacteria, which is 10-100 times more sensitive than commercial tests on the market.\n\n\n \nExample 3. Ultra-sensitive lateral flow test for detecting low levels of protein using non-magnified large area imaging\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBackground and objectives:\n There is an unmet need for more sensitive rapid tests for protein markers. This example demonstrates the use of the invention to detect low levels of protein (IL-2) rapidly with the user-friendly lateral flow assay format, fluorescent labeling particles, and non-magnified large area imaging. Detecting and quantifying low levels of target proteins in a sample is becoming more important as new markers for human disease (\ne\n.\ng\n., cancer and cardiovascular disease) are discovered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExperimental Methods:\n The lateral flow test strips were assembled as in Example 2. Antibodies were applied to membranes to make an IL-2 specific capture line (Pharmingen, cat. no. 554424) and a negative control line (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc.; biotin anti-mouse IgG, cat. no. 115-165-146) onto the membrane at a distance of 5 to10 mm from the wicking pad. The lines were allowed to dry (at least 15 min) before use. Streptavidin labeled fluorescent beads (Bangs Laboratories Inc., cat. no. CP01F-5121) were labeled with a biotin anti-IL-2 antibody (Pharmingen; cat. no. 554426) by combining the beads (10 µl of 1.23 × 10\n11\n/ml, antibody (10 µl of 1.0 µg/ ml stock)) and PBS (80 µl) and mixing (1.5 hours/ room temp). The beads were then centrifuged (5000 g, 10 min) and resuspended in PBS-B (100 µl). The anti-IL-2 antibody-coated fluorescent beads (2 µl) were added to the conjugate pad of each strip. A stock solution IL-2 (Pharmingen; Recombinant Mouce IL-2,cat. no. 550069) was serially diluted using PBS-B. Test samples (100 µl of an IL-2 dilution) were combined with PBS-TB (50 µl) and added to the sample pad of the test strip. After performing the test (∼15 minutes) the strips were imaged as in Example 2. The images were analyzed using Image-Pro software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nResults:\n \nFigure 7\n shows the results of the lateral flow test for IL-2. In the figure, capture and control line images are seen from representative test strips. The leftmost strip shows the negative control (no IL-2 added). When the negative control is compared to the middle and right strip, samples containing IL-2 at 2 pg/ml and 20 pg/ml, respectively, it is apparent that as the amount of IL-2 increased, the signal from the capture line also increased. The bottom bar graph shows the signal from the average of five replicates in relation to the amount of IL-2 added. The error bars represent a three standard deviation error between the replicate signals. The data shown indicates that the test detects IL-2 at a level of 2 pg/ ml, which is 10-100 times more sensitive than commercial tests on the market.\n\n\n \nExample 4. Ultra-sensitive lateral flow test for detecting low levels of protein in serum using non-magnified large area imaging\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBackground and objectives:\n Detecting target molecules in the context of complex samples is important for many applications. This example demonstrates the use of the invention to detect low levels of IL-2 in serum rapidly with a user-friendly lateral flow format and non-magnified large area imaging. In the experiment described below, IL-2 in serum was detected using fluorescent labeling particles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExperimental Methods\n: The lateral flow test strips were assembled as in Example 3. Antibodies were applied to membranes to make an IL-2 specific capture line (Pharmingen, monoclonal anti-IL-2, cat. no. 554424) and control line (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc.; biotin anti-mouse IgG, cat. no. 115-165-146) at a distance of 5 to10 mm from the wicking pad. The lines were allowed to dry (at least 15 min) before use. Streptavidin labeled fluorescent beads (Bangs Laboratories Inc., cat. no. CP01F-5121) were labeled with biotin anti-IL-2 antibody (Pharmingen; cat. no. 554426) by combining the beads (10 µl of 1.23 × 10\n11\n/mlstock), antibody (10 µl of 1.0 µg/ml stock) and PBS (80 µl) and mixing (1.5 hours at room temp). The beads were then centrifuged (5000 g, 10 min) and resuspended in PBS-B (100 µl). The anti-IL-2 coated fluorescent beads (2 µl) were added to the conjugate pad of each strip. A stock solution of IL-2 (Pharmingen; recombinant mouse IL-2, cat. no. 550069) was serially diluted using serum (Fitzgerald Laboratories; Normal goat serum, cat. no. 88-NG22). Test samples (100 µl of an IL-2 dilution) were combined with PBS-TB (50 µl) and added to the sample pad of the test strip. After performing the test (∼15 minutes) the strips were imaged as in Example 2. The images were analyzed using Image-Pro software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nResults:\n \nFigure 8\n shows the results of the lateral flow test for IL-2 in serum. In the figure, capture and control line images are seen from representative test strips. The leftmost strip shows the negative control. When the negative control is compared to the middle (20 pg/ml) and right (200 pg/ ml) strips, it is apparent that as the amount of IL-2 increased, the signal from the capture line also increased. The bottom bar graph shows the signal from the average of five replicates in relation to the amount of IL-2 added. The error bars represent a three standard deviation error between the replicate signals. The data shows that the invention can detect IL-2 at 20 pg/ ml of serum demonstrating that the assay detects very low levels of a target protein even in a complex sample.\n\n\n \nExample 5. Ultra-sensitive lateral flow test for multiplex detection of a protein and a bacterium using non-magnified large area imaging\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBackground and objectives:\n The need to test for the presence of a panel of target molecules is common. Examples are tests that survey samples for the various microbes that can cause sexually transmitted disease, panels of drugs-of-abuse, and sets of biowarfare agents. This example demonstrates the use of the invention to detect low levels of \nE. coli\n and IL-2 rapidly and simultaneously, using a user-friendly lateral flow assay format, fluorescent labeling particles, and non-magnified large area imaging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExperimental Methods:\n The lateral flow test strips were assembled as in Example 2. Antibodies were applied to membranes to make \nE. coli\n O157:H7 (BioTrace affinity purified; Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, cat. no. 01-95-90) and IL-2 (Pharmingen, cat. no. 554424) capture lines as well as a control line (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc.; biotin anti-goat IgG, cat. no. 115-165-146) at a distance of 5 to10 mm from the wicking pad. The lines were allowed to dry (at least 15 min) before use. Fluorescent beads for both IL-2 (refer to Example 3 for making IL-2 beads) and \nE. coli\n (refer to Example 2 for making \nE. coli\n beads) (2 µl of each) were added to the conjugate pad of each strip. Test samples (100 µl of an \nE. coli\n or IL-2 dilutions) were combined with PBS-TB (50 µl) and added to the sample pad of the test strip. After performing the test (∼15 minutes), the strips were imaged as in Example 2. The images were analyzed using Image-Pro software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nResults:\n \nFigure 9\n shows the results of a multiplexed lateral flow test using non-magnified large area imaging. The figure shows images of the capture and control lines from test strips onto which were applied samples containing (from left to right) both \nE. coli\n and IL-2, \nE. coli\n alone, IL-2 alone, and neither \nE. coli\n nor IL-2. This figure demonstrates that the lateral flow test can detect multiple target molecules in the same assay.\n\n\n \nExample, 6. Ultra sensitive lateral flow test for detecting low levels of virus using non-magnified large area imaging\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObjective:\n This example demonstrates how the invention can be used to detect low numbers of viral particles rapidly with a user-friendly lateral flow format and non-magnified large area imaging. In the experiment described below samples containing dilutions of lysed Influenza virus are detected using fluorescent labeling particles and large area imaging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExperimental Methods:\n The lateral flow test strips are assembled as in Example 2. Antibody lines are made by applying both an Influenza A specific capture line (QED, cat. no. 1302) and control line (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc.; biotin anti-mouse IgG, cat. no. 115-165-146) onto the membrane at 5 to10 mm from the wicking pad. The lines are allowed to dry (at least 15 min) before use. Streptavidin labeled fluorescent beads (Bangs Laboratories Inc.; cat. no. CP01 F-5121) are labeled with biotin anti-influenza A antibody (Virostat; cat. no. 1307) by combining the beads (10 µl of 1.23 × 10\n11\n/ml stock), antibody (10 µl of 1.0 µg/ml stock) and PBS (80 µl) and mixing (1.5 hours/ room temp). The beads are then centrifuged (5000 g, 10 min) and resuspended in PBS-B (100 µl). The anti-Influenza A coated fluorescent beads (2 µl) are added to the conjugate pad of each strip. A stock solution of purified Influenza A (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc: Influenza A/ PR/8/34 (H1N1), cat. no. 10-210-000) is lysed (Aoyagi, K., C. Ohue, et al. (1999). \nJ Clin Microbiol\n \n37\n(6): 1802-8) and then serially diluted using PBS-B. Test samples (100 µl of an IL-2 dilution) are combined with PBS-TB (50 µl) and added to the sample pad of the test strip. After performing the test (∼15 minutes), the strips are imaged as in Example 2. The images are analyzed using Image-Pro software.\n\n\n \nExample 7. Ultra-sensitive chemiluminescent lateral flow test for detecting low levels of protein using instant film\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObjective:\n There is an unmet need for ultra-sensitive point-of-care tests. Ideally, these tests are portable and do not require expensive instrumentation. This example demonstrates detection of low levels of the cytokine protein IL-2 using cost-effective instant film detection, high intensity chemiluminescent labeling particles, and a user-friendly lateral flow format.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExperimental Methods:\n The lateral flow test strips were assembled as in Example 2. Antibody lines were made by applying both an IL-2 specific capture line (Pharmingen; cat. no. 554424) and control line (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc.; biotin anti-mouse IgG, cat. no. 115-165-146) onto pieces of membrane (5-10 mm from the wicking pad). The lines were allowed to dry (at least 15 min) before use. Streptavidin labeled beads (Bangs Laboratories Inc.; cat. no. CP01F-5121) were labeled with biotin anti-IL-2 antibody (Pharmingen; cat. no. 554426) and biotin alkaline phosphatase (Pierce; cat. no. 29339) by combining the beads (10 µl of 1.23 × 10\n11\n/ml), antibody (10 µl of 1.0 µg/ ml stock), biotin labeled AP (10 µl of an mg/ ml stock) and PBS (70 µl) and mixing (1.5 hours/ room temp). The beads were then centrifuged (5000 g, 10 min) and resuspended in PBS-B (100 µl). The anti-IL-2 coated AP beads (2 µl) were added to the conjugate pad of each strip. A stock solution of IL-2 (Pharmingen; recombinant mouse IL-2, cat. no. 550069) was serially diluted using serum PBS. Test samples (100 µl of an IL-2 dilution) were combined with PBS-TB (50 µl) and added to the sample pad of the test strip. After performing the test (∼15 minutes), the strips were soaked with a chemiluminescent detection reagent (Pierce; Lumiphos, cat. no. 34150). After a short incubation (∼5 min), the strips were imaged using instant film (VWR; Polaroid Polapan Type 667, cat. no. GRP0617538). The instant film was then scanned (Hewlett Packard; HP scanjet 7400c, cat. no. C7713A).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nResults:\n \nFigure 10\n shows the results the lateral flow test using chemiluminescent labeling particles and instant film detection. Capture and control lines from representative test strips are shown. Comparing the strips onto which were applied samples containing IL-2 (from left to right: 0, 20, 200, and 2000 pg/ml) indicates that as the amount of IL-2 increased, the signal from the capture line also increased. The data show that the invention can detect IL-2 at concentrations as low as 20 pg/ ml using instant film. Thus this test is ultra-sensitive, rapid, easy to perform, and very inexpensive.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nVariations:\n Other films (including normal photographic film and x-ray film) could be used. Exposed film could be digitized using inexpensive commercial scanners yielding images that could be analyzed using image analysis software. Other chemiluminescent reagents, such as horseradish peroxidase, could be used rather than alkaline phosphatase. Numerous other chemiluminescent substrates could be used including CDP-star (Applied Biosystems; cat. no. T2307) or SignalSignal West Pico (Pierce; cat. no. 34080). Colorimetric assays could also be developed using a chromogenic substrate such as BM purple (Roche; cat. no. 1442074).\n\n\n \nExample 8. Ultra-sensitive, non-membrane based lateral flow assay for detecting low levels of protein using non-magnified large area imaging\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObjective:\n This example describes rapid and ultra-sensitive detection of a protein with an embodiment of the invention that uses porous \"capture threads\" rather than traditional lateral flow strips. The format minimizes the expanse of membrane that a particle must negotiate on its route through the detection area. There are two major advantages of the capture thread format, both of which increase the sensitivity of tests: (1) larger sample volumes are efficiently processed and (2) larger labeling particles, which have even more intense signals, can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 11\n shows the construction of the device used in this example. The sample is loaded into the sample zone where it flows laterally into the conjugate pad. The sample, drawn by the absorbent pad at the distal end of the apparatus, solubilizes and mobilizes the detection beads, which flow through the assay threads. In the experiment described below, dilutions of IL-2 were applied to slides containing a conjugate pad containing fluorescent labeling particles specific for IL-2, a capture threads for binding IL-2, and a positive control thread.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExperimental Methods:\n The tests were assembled on glass slides as follows (see \nFigure 11\n). Antibody stripes were applied to two pieces (3 mm × 25 mm) of a lateral flow membrane (Millipore; Hi-Flow Plus, cat. no. HF13502). The capture thread stripe contained a capture antibody (Pharmingen; monoclonal anti-IL-2, cat. no. 554424, 10 µl of a 1mg/ ml solution per 8 cm) and control antibody (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc.; biotin anti-mouse IgG, cat. no. 115-165-146, 10 µl of a 1mg/ ml solution per 8 cm). After drying (15 min), the threads were placed 10 mm (control thread) and 13 mm (capture thread) from the end of a glass slide (VWR; cat. no. 48300-025). A piece of glass fiber mesh (Millipore; glass fiber conjugate pad, part of cat. no. HFMIDAK015) was cut (3 mm × 25 mm) and placed 20 mm from the end of the glass slide. A piece of absorbent paper (50 mm x 25 mm) was placed at the end of the slide. A second glass slide was placed on top of the capture threads, glass fiber and absorbent paper so that one end of the glass slide was directly on the piece of glass fiber, with the other end overlapping onto the absorbent paper. Streptavidin labeled fluorescent beads (Bangs Laboratories Inc.; cat. no. CP01F-5121) were coated with a biotin anti-IL-2 antibody (Pharmingen; cat. no. 554426) by combining the beads (10 µl of 1.23 × 10\n11\n/ml), antibody (10 µl of 1.0 µg/ ml stock) and PBS (80 µl) and mixing (1.5 hours/ room temp) with rotation. The beads were then centrifuged (5000 g, 10 min) and resuspended in PBS-B (100 µl). The anti-IL-2 coated fluorescent beads (2 µl) were added to the conjugate pad of each assay slide. A stock solution of IL-2 (Pharmingen; Recombinant Mouse IL-2, cat. no. 550069) was serially diluted (for final concentrations of 0, 20, 200 pg/ml) using PBS-B. Test samples (1 ml of 0, 20 and 200 pg/ml dilutions) were added to the sample loading zone of the test slide. After performing the test (∼15 minutes), the strips were imaged as in Example 2. The images were analyzed using Image-Pro software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nResults:\n \nFigure 12\n shows the results of the test. The figure shows images of the capture and control threads from tests applied to samples containing IL-2 (0, 20, and 200 pg/ml). The results indicate that the test can detect IL-2 at 20 pg/ml. Furthermore, the concentration dependent speckled appearance of the capture threads suggests that individual labeling particles are being imaged.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe test used a volume that is 5 to 10 times the volume that is typically loaded on traditional lateral flow devices, yet the assays were completed in about the same time as when traditional \"low volume\" lateral flow tests were performed in the previous examples. By increasing the length of the capture threads even larger volumes could be analyzed. The ability to increase sensitivity by elongated the threads is a byproduct of the invention's ability to detect individual labeling particles. When detecting individual labeling particles, increasing the length of the capture line or thread and increasing the sample volume produces more signal without an increase in background (recall that the relevant background intensity can be measured in a region of comparable size to that containing a positive signal). In contrast, tests that measure integrated signal intensity do not improve by increasing the size of the capture line because the background increases in proportion to the signal.\n\n\n \nExample 9. Sensitive detection of protein molecules using non-magnified large area imaging and solid-phase capture immunoassay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverview.\n In this example, non-magnified large area imaging was used to detect IL-2 protein target-entities. IL-2 molecules were captured by antibodies that had been adsorbed to the surfaces of antibody-coated microtiter dish wells. Fluorescent particles, coated with a different anti-IL-2 antibody, were then bound to the surface-immobilized IL-2 molecules. Non-magnified large area imaging was used to detect the individual particle:IL-2 complexes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExperimental design.\n A 96 well plate (optically clear plastic bottom; Greiner America, Inc.; cat. num. 55896) was coated with biotinlyated BSA (Sigma; cat. num. A-8549; 50 µl of 200 µg/ml biotinylated BSA in.2M sodium bicarbonate, pH 10) The plate was incubated overnight at room temperature. The next day the wells were \"washed\" by adding PBS (200 µl) to each well and then aspirated. The biotinylated BSA-coated wells were then further coated with streptavidin/PBS solution (Jackson Labs; cat. num. 016-000-084; 50 µl of a 100 µg/ml solution) and incubated overnight at room temperature. The next day, the wells were washed as stated above. The biotin: streptavidin coated wells were then coated with biotinylated Rat anti-mouse IL-2 antibody (50 µl of a 0.5 mg/ml solution; Pharmingen; cat. num. 554426). The wells were covered and allowed to shake at room temperature for 3.5 hours. After incubation the wells were washed three times with PBS-B (Sigma; cat. num. A-7638) /0.05% triton X 100 (Sigma/X-100). The wells were then blocked with Block Aid (150 µl; Molecular Probes; cat. num. B-10710) followed by a 40-minute incubation at room temperature. The Block Aid was decanted and ELISA diluent (50 µl; Pharmingen; cat. num. 2728KD) was added to each well. An IL-2 standard (150 pg/ml; Pharmingen; cat. num. 27316E) was serially diluted in ten fold increments with standard diluent (Pharmingen; cat. num. 2708KD), and 50 µl of each dilution was added to separate wells. The plate was allowed to Incubate at room temperature for two hours. After incubation antibody coated red fluorescent particles (10\n6\n; Molecular probes; 1µm; sulfate; 580/605 nm; cat. num. F-8851) which were coated by passive adsorption with a rat anti-mouse IL-2 antibody (Pharmingen; cat. num. 18161 D) were added to each well. To passively adsorb antibodies to the surface sulfate groups of the beads, particles (62.5 µl; 2% solids; Molecular Probes Cat. No. F8851, 1µm, red fluorescent (580/605)) were washed by repeatedly (3 repetitions) by centrifugation (5 min; 10,200 x g; Eppendorf Centrifuge Model 5417C, Eppendorf Swinging Bucket Rotor Model A-12-11) and resuspension of the particle pellet (1ml PBS/.15 M NaCl). The particle pellet was resuspended in PBS (125 µl, for a concentration of 1% solids) followed by drop wise addition of purified antibody (1.25 nmol for a ratio of 1 nmol antibody /mg particles) with vortexing. The suspension was incubated with rotation, for 2 hours at 25°C followed by overnight incubation at 4°C. Particles were washed (3 repetitions as above, but with resuspension after the centrifugations in PBS-TB), resuspended in PBS-TB (200 µl), and incubated (30 minutes, 25°C) with rotation. Particles were washed twice as above and resuspended in PBS-TB (125, µl for a concentration of 1% solids). After the addition of the passively coated beads (10\n7\n), the wells were allowed to incubate at room temperature for one hour. The plates were washed six times with 1X ELISA wash solution (200 µl; from a dilution of a 20X stock; Pharmingen; cat. num. 2605KC) and then once with water. Fluorescence was detected by imaging on the GPS Imager with Texas Red optical filter set (Chroma excitation 560/55 nm, emission 645/75 nm) for the red fluorescent particles. Image-Pro Plus software, version 4.1 (Media cybernetics) was used to capture and process images from a CCD Imager as in Example 2. Positive signals detected on the Imager were confirmed to be particles by using an Axioplan II fluorescent microscope (Carl, Zeiss Inc., Thomwood, NY) equipped with the same filter sets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nResults.\n \nFigure 13\n shows IL-2 detection in a solid phase capture assay. As the concentration of IL-2 decreases, the number of anti-IL-2 antibody coated fluorescent particles (seen as white spots) also decreases. When compared to the no IL-2 negative control, the sensitivity of the assay (defined as two standard deviations above the average negative control) is about 1.5 pg/ml. This result is comparable to ELISA tests for IL-2.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 10. Sensitive detection of protein molecules using non-magnified large area imaging and liquid-phase capture\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverview.\n In this example, as in the previous one, non-magnified large area imaging was used to detect IL-2 protein target-entities. Here, however, IL-2 molecules were bound to pairs of antibody-coated particles in the liquid phase. As in earlier examples, one particle is fluorescent and one particle is magnetic. Particle:analyte complexes are deposited in a planar detection zone using magnetic force. These complexes are imaged using non-magnified large area imaging as before.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExperimental procedure.\n Anti-IL-2 magnetic particles were made by coupling magnetic particles with active tosyl- groups to monoclonal antibodies raised against IL-2 (Rat anti-IL-2, Pharmingen; cat. num. 18161 D). Magnetic particles (30 mg/ml; 100 µl; Dynal, Oslo, Norway, Dynaparticles M-280 Tosylactivated Cat. No. 140.03) were washed in PB (three wash repetitions, 1 ml each) in a microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml) using a magnetic separation of the particles followed by removal of the supernatant (all magnetic separations in this example, except where noted, were carried out using a device from Polysciences Inc.; cat. no. 8MB4111S). Particles were resuspended in PB (70 µl). Monoclonal antibodies against IL-2 (60 µg; Pharmingen; cat. num. 18161 D) were combined with magnetic particles (70 µl) in a microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml) and vortexed briefly. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes using rotation (about 30 rpm unless otherwise noted). After 20 minutes BSA (IgG free) was added to a final concentration of 0.1% and incubated overnight at 37°C with rotation. The magnetic particles were washed twice (1 ml each; using magnetic separation) with PBS-B. The magnetic particles were resuspended in buffer (0.2M Tris pH 8.5 supplemented with 0.1 % (w/v) BSA (IgG free)) and incubated for 4 hours at 37°C with rotation. Finally, the magnetic particles were washed twice (in PBS-B using magnetic separation) and resuspended (the final concentration was 1% solids in PBS-B). After making the magnetic beads, an IL-2 standard (150 pg/ml; Pharmingen; cat. num. 27316E) was serially diluted in ten fold increments. In separate 1.5 ml tubes, 20 µl of each dilution was combined with magnetic particles coated with rat anti-IL-2 antibody and red fluorescent particles (10\n8\n particles; Molecular Probes; 1 µm; sulfate; 580/605 nm; cat. num. F-8851) which were coated (see Example 9 for passive adsorption coating) with biotin labeled rat anti-mouse IL-2 (Pharmingen; cat. num. 554426). The particle:IL-2 suspension (120 µl) was mixed with Block Aid (60 µl; Molecular Probes; cat. num. B-10710) and sonicated for 30 seconds (setting 8;550 Sonic Dismembrator; Misonix). After sonication, additional Block Aid (60 µl) was added and the tubes were mixed. The tubes were then incubated with mixing for one hour at room temp. After incubation the tubes were washed three times in PBS-TB. A wash consisted of a magnetic separation to draw the magnetic particle:IL-2:fluorescent particle sandwich to one side of the tube followed by an aspiration to remove the supernatant. After each wash, PBS-TB (50 µl) was added. Aliquots were added to an optically clear plastic bottomed plate (Greiner America, Inc.; cat. num. 655896). Fluorescence was detected by imaging on a CCD Imager with Texas Red optical filter set (Chroma/excitation 560/55 nm, emission 645/75 nm) for the red fluorescent particles. Image-Pro Plus software, version 4.1 (Media cybernetics) was used to capture and process images from the CCD Imager. Positive signals detected by CCD imaging were confirmed to be particles by using an Axioplan II fluorescent microscope (Carl, Zeiss Inc., Thomwood, NY) equipped with the same filter sets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nResults.\n \nFigure 14\n shows IL-2 detection on a solid phase assay. As the concentration of IL-2 decreases, the number of anti-IL-2 antibody coated fluorescent particles (seen as white spots) also decreases. When compared to the no IL-2 negative control, the sensitivity of the assay (defined as two standard deviations above the average negative control) is about 1.5 pg/ml.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 11. Immunoassay for detecting multiple human cytokines using non-magnified large area imaging\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCytokines are essential mediators of cell-cell communication and are central to orchestrating the cellular dynamics underlying the immune response. Complex combinations and low concentrations of these proteins are characteristic of pathogenic microenvironments. Thus, methods for sensitive multiplexed detection of cytokines are needed for research and clinical analysis. In this example, the invention is used to construct such a test. In the example, individual protein molecules are detected without using magnification. Antibodies attached to a microtiter well are used to capture the protein molecules which are then labeled by binding to high intensity fluorescent particles as in Example 9.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 15\n depicts the scheme of the assay which tests for four cytokines: granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The test developed in this example is formally similar to the previous test (multiplexed viruses) except for the following significant distinction. Because protein molecules (as opposed to viruses) are the targets in this assay, the capture antibodies (linked to the well surface) and detection antibodies (linked to fluorescent particles) must recognize non-overlapping epitopes on the targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCoating fluorescent particles and wells with anti-cytokine antibodies.\n Standard anti-cytokine antibody pairs (with non-overlapping epitopes) are obtained from commercial sources as detailed previously (Carson, R. T., \net al\n., J Immunol Methods 227:41-52,1999).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies are bound to microtiter dish wells in four adjacent distinct spots per well (1 spot per antibody) by passive absorption. Each anti-viral antibody is spotted (1 µl; 1 µg/µl) in a well of a 96-well microtiter plate (Greiner America; cat. num. 55896) and incubated for 2 hrs at room temperature in a humidified chamber (Boekel Slide Moat; model 240000). Wells are then washed and blocked as in Example 9 (Note that alternatively, an equimolar mixture of the antibodies can be bound as a homogenous mixture to the wells in this example.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nColor-coded cytokine-specific fluorescent particles are made by coating fluorescently dyed polystyrene particles with distinct emission spectra with the anti-cytokine detection antibodies (detailed in Carson \net al\n, 1999, \nsupra)\n as described in the previous example. Fluorescent particles are coded as follows: GM-CSF-specific particles: Yellow-Green; IL-2-specific particles: Orange; IL-4-specific particles: Crimson; and TNF-α-specific particles: Infrared. The 4 types of antibody-coated particles are mixed and prepared as described in the previous example. As in the previous example, it is also possible to use the same type of fluorescent particle for each virus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStandard curves.\n Standard curves are constructed that relate the concentration of the cytokines to the integrated assay signal. Samples (200 µl; in PBS-TB; run in triplicate) containing 10 fold dilutions of individual cytokines at concentrations ranging from 10 pg/ml to 10 µg/ml are added to individual microtiter dish wells containing spotted capture antibodies. After 30 minutes, the wells are washed with PBS-TB (200 µl; 4X). The combined cytokine-specific particles (200 µl) are added to the wells and spun briefly in a centrifuge (\nBeckman Allegra\n 6; GH-3.8 rotor; 1200 g) so as to coat the bottom surface of the well with the particles. After incubating the particles for 10 minutes at room temperature, unbound particles are removed by washing (3 washes of 200 µl PBS-TB; each wash solution is agitated by re-pipetting 5 times). Next, the number, color, and cumulative intensity of the particles bound to each spot is determined. The wells are then imaged and analyzed using a CCD imager as in Example 2 except that multiple images are acquired using the appropriate filter sets (yellow green: excitation Chroma HQ480/40x and emission Chroma HQ535/50m; orange: excitation Chroma HQ535/50X and emission Chroma HG610/75m; crimson: excitation Chroma HQ560/55x and emission Chroma HQ645/75m; and infared: excitation Chroma HQ710/75x and emission Chroma HQ810/90m). Viruses are identified by the spots to which bound particles adhere. Additional diagnostic robustness is provided by the fact that only particles of the expected color adhere to a particular spot if the assay is successful.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nDetecting cytokines in an uncharacterized sample.\n A sample (200 µl) containing, or potentially containing, cytokines GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-4, and/or TNF-α is added to a microtiter dish well containing spotted capture antibodies. The sample is processed and analyzed as described above. The concentration of the cytokines is estimated by using interpolation to compare the quantified signal corresponding to the four cytokine-specific capture antibody spots to the established standard curves.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 12. Competitive immunoassay for total (bound plus free) cytokine IL-2 using non-magnified large area imaging\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompetitive immunoassays are used when a target-entity does not have non-overlapping category-specific binding sites (\ne\n.\ng\n., epitopes). This is generally the case for small molecule analytes such as drugs of abuse (\ne\n.\ng\n., cocaine), chemical pollutants (\ne\n.\ng\n., PCBs), or hormones (\ne\n.\ng\n., Triiodothyronine). Competitive immunoassays are also useful when only one epitope on a target molecule is \naccessible\n to antibodies, for example, when a small protein hormone or cytokine is bound to, and largely engulfed by, a larger binding protein or receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetitive immunoassays measure the capture of an analogue of the target-entity, which, in contrast to the target-entities, does have two distinct binding sites and therefore is measurable using basic immunoassay procedures. Target-entities in the sample can compete with the analogue for capture sites. Therefore, the degree of capture of the analogue is a function of the concentration of the target-entity in the sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis example describes an assay constructed using the invention that tests for total cytokine IL-2 (\ni\n.\ne\n., bound IL-2 plus free IL-2) using a competitive immunoassay format. A schematic of the competitive immunoassay is displayed in \nFigure 16\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCompetitive immunoassay for IL-2.\n The competitive immunoassay for IL-2 is carried out using a commercial kit (Chemicon; cat. #CYT111) and following the manufacturer's recommended protocols with the modifications noted below. The kit is representative of a common variety of immunoassay that causes a solution in a microtiter dish to become colored. The color intensity indicates the amount of analyte in the sample and is a result of the cumulative action of bound enzyme:antibody conjugates. The test constructed using the invention differs from the classical competitive immunoassay. First, Individual targets - in this case the IL-2:biotin conjugate - are imaged by binding to a fluorescent streptavidin-coated particle. Second, bound fluorescent particles are imaged through optically clear well bottoms rather than spectrophotometric determination of a color change from above the well. Although the fluorescent particles are microscopic (∼1 µm), imaging is carried out without magnification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause a flat, optically clear well-bottom is required imaging individual binding events, an appropriate microtiter plate is substituted for the secondary antibody-coated plate supplied in the commercial kit. A 96-well microtiter plate with an optically clear bottom (Greiner Labs; catalogue number 665097) is coated with mouse anti-interleukin 2antibody (Chemicon; # MAB1018) as described previously (Coligan \net al\n., 1994, section 6.22.1, \nsupra).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the commercial kit, a streptavidin:alkaline phosphatase conjugate is used to detect the bound IL-2:biotin conjugate via the reaction of chromogenic alkaline phosphate substrates. In this example, streptavidin-coated fluorescent particles (Molecular Probes; cat #8775; 1 µm diameter; fluorescent red) are substituted for the streptavidin:alkaline phosphatase conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetitive immunoassays for both standards (included in the commercial kit) and unknowns are processed as recommended by the commercial kit manufacturer with the following exceptions. Samples are processed in plates with optically clear well-bottoms (see above). At the point when the streptavidin:alkaline phosphatase conjugate would be added according to manufacturer's protocol, streptavidin-coated fluorescent particles are added (100 µl;10\n7\n particles/ml in PBS-T). The assays are then processed and imaged as described in Example 11. Optical filters for excitation (Chroma HQ560/55x) and emission (Chroma HQ645/75m) used to image the wells are chosen in concordance with the optical properties of the fluorescent particles (excitation/emission: 580/605).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 13. Sensitive detection of nucleic acid molecules using a dipstick format and non-magnified large area imaging\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverview.\n In this example, non-magnified large area imaging was used to detect biotinylated DNA that was specifically bound to avidin-labeled fluorescent beads. A simple but sensitive dipstick assay was used to achieve rapid binding of the fluorescent beads to biotinylated lambda DNA that was bound to a nylon membrane. The assay format may have potential in point-of-care genetic testing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExperimental design\n. Biotinylated lambda DNA was spotted on a nylon membrane (0.2 µm pore; Pall Biodyne A; cat. num. 28152-409) in ten fold dilutions (ranging from 1 µg to 10 pg). On the same filter, a negative control sample (1 µg of non-biotinylated lambda DNA) was deposited. The DNA was cross-linked to the membranes using a U.V. crosslinker (Stratagene). The membranes were blocked by saturating the membranes with BB buffer (50 µl) for 30 min at room temperature. The membranes were then allowed to dry. After blocking, one end of the membrane was dipped into a solution containing 10\n12\n avidin-coated Texas red fluorescent beads (0.45 µm; Spherotech; cat. num. VFP-0562-5) in a 1.5 ml tube. The solution traveled up the membrane by capillary action until it reached its peak height, about three quarters of the length of the strip. The spots of DNA were placed on the strip so that they would be well below the peak height of the solution. The membrane was then washed in PBS-TB (35 ml) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Fluorescence was detected by imaging using a CCD imager in conjunction with a Texas Red optical filter set (Chroma; excitation 560/55 nm, emission 645/ 75 nm) that was appropriate for detection the red fluorescent beads. Image Pro Plus software, version 4.1 (Media cybernetics) was used to capture and process images from the CCD Imager. Positive signals detected on the Imager were confirmed to be beads by using an Axioplan II fluorescent microscope (Carl, Zeiss Inc., Thomwood, NY) equipped with the same filter sets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nResults.\n \nFigure 17\n shows the detection of DNA molecules down to a level of about 10\n6\n molecules in a spot using non-magnified large area imaging. The spot containing 100 pg of biotinylated lambda DNA has a significantly stronger signal than does the negative control containing 1 µg of non-blotinylated lambda DNA. The expected dose response can be seen in the figure. As The DNA in a spot increases, so does the number of fluorescent beads (seen as white spots in the figure).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVariations. An important variation of the test is to use specific hybridization probes as the category binding molecule. Such probes could be directly or indirectly labeled as described in various other examples. Similarly, tests for measuring expression of particular categories of RNA molecules could be developed in this assay format.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 14. A test for genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDetecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is a critical modem genetics application - in both applied (\ne\n.\ng\n., medical and agricultural) and basic biological fields. This example describes the application of the invention for creating a novel test that determines a patient's genotype at the site of a common mutation causing sickle cell anemia using a homogenous, non-amplified format. The test uses an oligonucleotide ligation assay in which one of the probes is labeled with a magnetic particle and one with fluorescent particles \nLabeled probes for oligonucleotide ligation assay.\n The oligonucleotide ligation assay for genotyping SNPs uses two oligonucleotide moieties are used in the assay: a \"constant\" oligonucleotide and an \"allele specific\" oligonucleotide. The constant oligonucleotide is labeled with a magnetic particle at the 3' end. The allele specific oligonucleotide is labeled with fluorescent particle at its 5' end (different color particles are used for different alleles). The constant oligonucleotide is designed to hybridize to one strand at the locus so that the 5' end of the oligonucleotide is adjacent to the polymorphic nucleotide. The \"allele specific\" oligonucleotide hybridizes to the locus so that its 3' terminal nucleotide, which corresponds to the single nucleotide polymorphism, abuts the 5' terminal nucleotide of the constant oligonucleotide when both are hybridized to the complementary nucleic acid strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe constant oligonucleotide\n\n(p\nGGAGAAGTCTGCCGTTACTG\nCGCTCTAGAACTAGTGGATC(T)\n50\n-NH\n2\n) is synthesized with a 3' amino group modification (Midland Certified Scientific Reagent Co.) and is phosphorylated enzymatically on the 5' end using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The sickle cell and wild-type allele specific oligonucleotides NH\n2\n-(T)\n50\nCGCTCTAGAACTAGTGGATC\nATGGTGCACCTGACTCCTGT\n and NH\n2\n-(T)\n50\nCGCTCTAGAACTAGTGGATC\nATGGTGCACCTGACTCCTGA\n are synthesized with 5' amino group modifications. Note that the oligonucleotides are bipartite: one part (distal to the amino modification, underlined) hybridizes to the globin gene and the other part (proximal to the amino modification) functions as a spacer or tether. Incorporating a spacer between the end of oligonucleotide that binds to the particle (via the amino group) and the part of the oligonucleotide that is destined to hybridize to genomic DNA may improve hybridization efficiency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nBinding oligonucleotides to particles.\n Oligonucleotides, modified by terminal amino groups, are covalently linked to particles using tosyl chemistry as described previously (Example 10). The constant oligonucleotide is linked via its 3' amino group to tosyl activated magnetic particles (2.8 µm; Dynal; cat. num 140.03). The sickle cell allele specific oligonucleotide is linked to red fluorescent particles (200 nm; Molecular Probes; catalogue # F-8811) and the wild-type allele specific oligonucleotide is linked to green fluorescent particles (200 nm; Molecular Probes; catalogue num. F-8810) via their 5' amino groups. After linkage, washing, and blocking, the oligonucleotide coated particles are mixed together at a final concentration of 2%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nHomogenous oligonucleotide ligation assay.\n Human DNA is purified from the buffy coat blood fraction (\nSambrook, J, et al., Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 2001\n)). Purified human genomic DNA (1 µg in 12 µl EE) is denatured by heating at 100°C for 3 min, quick-chilled on an ice bath, and then mixed with 5 µl of the oligonucleotide-coated particle mixture, and 2 µl of 10X ligation buffer (New England Biolabs) and allowed to anneal at 50°C for 1 hr. T4 DNA ligase (1 µl 400 u/µl; New England Biolabs) is added and the ligation reaction is allowed to proceed at 37°C for 1 hr. A negative control sample is placed in another well of the dish. The negative control is identical in composition to the experimental sample except that EE is substituted for the human DNA. The negative control is processed in the same way as the experimental sample. The samples are diluted to 200 µl by adding EE (120 µl). Black ink (50 µl; Black No. 17, Pelikan, Hanover, Germany) is added to the well of a 96-well microtiter dish with an optically clear bottom (Greiner Labs; catalogue number 665097). The microtiter dish is placed on a flat magnet (Dexter Magnetics, LifeSep, 96F) for 15 minutes. The dish is then gently moved into position over a CCD imager (\nFigure 3\n), and the bottom of the wells containing the assay and control are imaged successively. The images are then analyzed using an image analysis software package (Image-Pro Plus software, version 4.1; Media Cybernetics) as in Example 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe number of green and red particles imaged on the bottom of the negative control sample represents the background particle count. These numbers are subtracted from the number of similarly colored particles imaged on the bottom of the experimental sample. The ratio of red particles to green particles determines the genotype at the sickle cell locus. If the ratio of green particles (wild-type allele) to red particles (mutant allele) is high (<90%), the genotype is homozygous wild-type. If the ratio is small (<10%) the genotype is homozygous for the sickle cell allele. Finally, if the ratio is approximately 1:1, the genotype is heterozygous for the sickle cell allele.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nVariations\n. Numerous variations of this scheme can be incorporated. Amplification products of genomic DNA or cellular RNA can also be used as the template to which the oligonucleotide probes anneal prior to ligation. Alternative labeling strategies can also be used. For example, the selection moiety (magnetic particles in the example) can be replaced by a hapten (\ne\n.\ng\n., biotin or digoxygenin) which can function as a selection moiety by using streptavidin or anti-digoxygenin antibodies as a capture reagent (Immobilized, for example, on a surface or a magnetic particle). Similarly, the signaling moiety can have one or more of various signaling characters (\ne\n.\ng\n., fluorescence, chemiluminescence, bioluminescence, radio frequency, size, etc.). As is true for the selection moiety, the signaling moiety can be directly (\ne\n.\ng\n., covalently) or indirectly linked to the allele specific oligonucleotide. For example, the allele specific oligonucleotide could be modified by biotin and fluorescently labeled streptavidin could be indirectly bound and used as the signaling moiety. Alternatively, a signaling moiety, such as a fluorescent particle or a selection moiety, such as a magnetic particle, could be coated with a tag sequence that allows the particle to bind by nucleic acid hybridization to a tag complement moiety on the oligonucleotide that hybridizes to genomic DNA. When, as in this latter case, the labeling is indirect, assays can be constructed in which the ligation to genomic DNA is carried out first, and then the labeling and/or signaling moieties are associated with the oligonucleotides (ligated and unligated) afterwards. This method may be advantageous when using large labeling moieties that could sterically or kinetically lower the efficiency of the ligation reaction. Finally, genomic or cellular RNA can be used as the template on which ligation takes place.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 15. Non-amplified multiplex SNP analysis using a lateral flow format and non-magnified large area imaging\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAn important goal of modem medical genetics and pharmacogenomics is to obtain genomic profiles of patients rapidly. Genetic markers can be an early warning of disease (\ne\n.\ng\n., breast cancer or Huntington's disease) or can indicate to which medications a patient is likely to respond favorably. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are medically important genetic markers because of their abundance in the genome and because many human genetic diseases are caused by point mutations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDevelopment of technology that is rapid, highly multiplexed, and inexpensive is a current aim of applied medical genetics. In this example, the invention is used to create a test with these attributes. The assay - which does not require DNA amplification - scans a human DNA sample for nucleotide polymorphism genotypes in 3 different genes (β-globin, a -antitrypsin, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTechnical overview.\n As in the previous example, this assay uses the oligonucleotide ligation assay to test for SNP alleles. However, in this example, a lateral flow test is used to detect the ligated products. This format facilitates testing for numerous target molecules (in this case SNPs) using only a single signaling moiety. The ability to detect many target SNP alleles in this format arises from the potential to distinguish targets by their hybridization to distinct capture oligonucleotides immobilized at known sites on the membrane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe test can be divided into two stages, which are diagrammed in \nFigure 18\n and \nFigure 19\n. The first stage is an oligonucleotide ligation assay (top of \nFigure 18\n). As in the previous example, oligonucleotide pairs, designed for allele-specific ligation, are hybridized to denatured genomic DNA and ligated. In the second stage of the assay, ligated single-stranded products are applied to a lateral flow device where they encounter and hybridize to complementary capture oligonucleotide tags (bottom of \nFigure 18\n). The individual captured oligonucleotides are imaged using a CCD imager by virtue of bound particles that emit a high-intensity chemiluminescent signal (\nFigure 19\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nOligonucleotides.\n In this example, nucleotide polymorphisms are genotyped in 3 genes: β-globin, α -antitrypsin, and CFTR. A set of oligonucleotides is synthesized for each locus to be genotyped. As in the previous example, each set comprises one constant oligonucleotide and one or more allele-specific oligonucleotides. When hybridized to the corresponding strand of genomic DNA, the constant oligonucleotide and the one allele-specific oligonucleotide that complements the nucleotide polymorphism are ligated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe oligonucleotide sets are designed analogously to the set in the previous example except for the following differences. Each allele-specific oligonucleotide is bipartite with one part corresponding to a genomic sequence, as before. However, in this example the allele-specific oligonucleotide is synthesized with an adjacent unique tag sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo facilitate equivalent hybridization of multiple probes in a single reaction, oligonucleotides are designed so that the melting temperatures (T\n \nm\n \n; see definitions) of the functional segments with their complements are approximately equal. The multipartite oligonucleotides are preferably about 20 nucleotides long with T\n \nm\n \n's equal to 60° ±2°. The target mutations and oligonucleotide ligation assay with oligonucleotides similar to those in Table 3 have been described previously (\nNickerson, D. A., et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 87: 8923-7, 1990\n).\n\n \nTable 3.

Capture oligonucleotides (Table 3) are applied and bound to plastic-backed nitrocellulose filters (3 µm pore size; Schleicher & Schuell) as described previously (\nRule, G.S., et al., Clinical Chemistry 42: 1206-9, 1996\n), except that, in the present example, multiple capture oligonucleotides are used. As described by Rule \net al\n., the first line is applied 1 cm from the bottom edge of the filter. Subsequent lines of capture oligonucleotides are applied in parallel lines separated by a space of 3 mm (moving away from the bottom edge of the filter and the previous line). Filters are cut into 0.5 mm x 8 cm strips (oligonucleotide lines run perpendicular to the long dimension).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nOligonucleotide ligation assay\n. The oligonucleotide mixture (1 nM, each oligonucleotide) and human genomic DNA (1 µg) are combined in 14 µl ligation buffer (see definitions). The mixture is denatured by heating to 95°C (3 min) in a thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer, GeneAmp PCR System 9700) and then cooled (at 5% of the maximum down-ramp rate) to 37°C. T4 DNA ligase (1 µl of 400 u/µl enzyme; New England Biolabs; enzyme concentration expressed as cohesive end units) is added to the reaction which is then incubated at 37° for 1 hr.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction is stopped and the DNA is denatured by heating to 100°C in a heat block for 1 minute. The sample is quick chilled at 0°C by immersion in an ice bath and then diluted to 150 µl with HYB (see definitions).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nBinding alkaline phosphatase to avidin-coated particles.\n Streptavidin-coated particles (0.95 µm diameter; Bangs Labs; #CP01 N) are coated with biotinylated alkaline-phosphatase (Pierce; #29339) so that only about half of the maximum number of alkaline phosphatase molecules are bound. Such particles retain the ability to bind to biotinylated target molecules via the free streptavidin moieties. Partial coating is accomplished by incubating the streptavidin-coated particles with biotinylated alkaline phosphatase at a ratio of about 1 × 10\n4\n biotinylated alkaline phosphatase molecules per particle. The ratio is empirically established for each lot of particles by determining a minimum ratio of biotinylated alkaline phosphatase to particles required to saturate the biotinylated alkaline phosphatase binding sites on the particles. A fraction of this ratio (\ne\n.\ng\n., 1/2) is then used to coat the particles. The minimum ratio of biotinylated alkaline phosphatase to particles required to saturate the particles is determined by binding serial dilutions of biotinylated alkaline phosphatase with a fixed number of particles, eliminating free biotinylated alkaline phosphatase by spin filtration (spinX; Costar, #8161), recovering the particles, and measuring the chemiluminescent signal of single particles on nylon filters (GeneScreen; NEN) using CDP-star (CDP-Star; NEN) and X-ray film luminography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStreptavidin-coated particles (2 × 10\n9\n particles) are partially coated with biotinylated alkaline phosphatase using the biotinylated alkaline phosphatase:particle ratio established as described above (\ne\n.\ng\n., 10\n4\n). The coating reaction (100 µl) is carried out for 1 hr at room temperature in EEN/0.1%BSA. Particles are washed (3 × 500 µl EEN) using spin filtration (spinX; costar; #8161) and collected in EEN (200 µl).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nChromatography and detection.\n Chromatography is carried out at 37°C according to the method of Rule \net al\n. (1996, \nsupra).\n The oligonucleotide ligation assay (150 µl) is placed in a 10 × 75 mm polystyrene test tube. A nitrocellulose strip is then placed in the tube so that the bottom of the strip (the first oligonucleotide stripe applied to the strip is 1 cm above the bottom edge) is resting in the oligonucleotide ligation assay solution. After 20 minutes, the strip is removed from the tube and washed 3 times (5 minutes each wash) in HYB solution (50°C). The filters are covered with particles (10\n8\n biotinylated alkaline phosphatase-coated particles in 1 ml EEN) and allowed to incubate for 1 hr at room temperature. Free particles are washed from the filters (5 × 10 ml EEN washes with vigorous agitation). Filters are covered with CDP-Star (NEN) and luminographed using x-ray film. Before exposing, the corners of the filter are distinctly marked using fluorescent tape (Glogos™ II Autorad Markers, Stratagene Cat# 420201) so that the exposed x-ray film can be aligned in register with a template that indicates the position of the various SNP lines on the filter. Chemiluminescent signal arising from binding of the particles to single captured SNP molecules indicates the presence of particular SNP genotypes in the target DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAlternative embodiments.\n Other types of labels could be used including fluorescent and light-scattering labels. Similarly, a wide range of instrumentation can be used to detect the signal (\ne\n.\ng\n., CCD cameras, chromogenic detection, instant film, etc.). Other types of substrates could be used such as non-bibulous substrates (\ne\n.\ng\n., glass slides). Flow through test formats are also possible. The assay could also use a microfluidic format (using, for example, the Flow-Thru Chip™ system; Gene-logic) rather than using bibulous filter in the lateral flow assay. In this case, the capture probes are immobilized in an addressable geometry (\ni\n.\ne\n., in a known order) on the walls of a micro-machined channel through which the (ligated and unligated) oligonucleotide probes flow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther embodiments are in the claims."

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention lies in the field of radiopharmaceuticals and provides new chelating agents to link biomolecules and carbonyl moieties for labeling with technetium and rhenium. In particular the invention relates to bifunctional tridentate pyrazolyl-polyamines, pyrazolyl-aminothioethers, and pyrazolyl-aminophosphines which stabilize the moieties [M(CO)\n3\n]\n+\n (M = Re, Tc, Mn) and bind to biomolecules which accumulate in diseased tissues. The invention relates to the chelators as such, to chelators coupled to a biomolecule and to either of these complexed with carbonyl. In addition the invention relates to a kit for providing radiolabeled biomolecules and to the use of such radiolabeled molecules in diagnosis and therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diagnosis and therapy of cancer still needs a significant input from the chemical, radiochemical and pharmaceutical point of view. Tumour seeking compounds stable \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n, with high specific activity and specificity are still an important issue in the radiopharmaceutical field. Since the publication of international patents on [Re(CO)\n3\n]\n+\n and [Tc(CO)\n3\n]\n+\n [1] a significant interest has appeared in this oxidation state, which opens new perspectives on pharmaceutical and Nuclear Medicine fields. The search for new chelating agents is essential as they are determinant for the uptake of biological vectors. Several chelating agents have been described in patents [1, 2] and publications [3, 4, 5].\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAlves et al. (J. Chem. Soc., (2002) 24, 4714\n) discloses a chelating agent of the pyrazolyl-thioetheramine type. Chelating agents of this type are also disclosed in\nVan Berkel et al. (Reactive & Functional Polymers, (1997) 32, 139\n). Chelating agents of the pyrazolyl-polythioether type are disclosed in \nGarcia-Anton et al. (Eur. J. Inorg. Chem., (2002) 3319\n) and \nAdhikary et al. (Inorg. Chem., (1994) 33, 1376\n). Chelating agents of the pyrazolyl-aminothioether type are described in \nTandon et al. (Inorg. Chim. Acta, (1993) 213, 289\n), \nPaap et al. (Inorg. Chim. Acta, (1988) 150, 57\n) and Di Vaira et al. (\nDatabase Chemabs, 1986, STN no. 104:140923\n). In each of the latter three disclosures, however, the compounds have a group attached to the amino moiety which is unsuitable for attachment of a biomolecule. \nAddison et al. (Inorg. Chim. Acta, (1988) 142, 95\n) discloses a chelating agent of the pyrazolyl-polyamine type, but the amino moiety does not bear a spaced functional group suitable for modification, e.g. with a biomolecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is the object of the present invention to enlarge the family of bifunctional chelating agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis is achieved by the invention by chelating agents of the general formula:\n\n \n \n\nwherein m is 0 or 1;\n\nX is NR\n4\n ;\n\nY is SR\n5\n, NHR\n5\n or P(R\n5\n)\n2\n;\n\nR\n1\n and R\n3\n are the same or different and are selected from H, alkyl or aryl;\n\nR\n2\n is H, COOH, NHR\n6\n or (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCOOR\n6\n ;\n\nR\n4\n is (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCOOR\n6\n or (CH\n2\n)\nn\nOR\n6\n ;\n\nR\n5\n is H, alkyl, aryl, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCOOR\n6\n or (CH\n2\n)\nn\nOR\n6\n \n\nR\n6\n is H, alkyl or aryl, or a biomolecule; and n is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese molecules combine two functions. One is for the stabilization of metal centers, including radioactive metals, and comprises different donor atom sets, and the other is a functional group for binding to the molecule of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alkyl may be a C\n1\n alkyl, C\n2\n alkyl, C\n3\n alkyl, C\n4\n alkyl, C\n5\n alkyl or C\n6\n alkyl, in particular selected from methyl, ethyl, \nn\n-propyl, isopropyl, \nn\n-butyl, isobutyl, \ns-\nbutyl, \nt\n-butyl, \nn\n-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, \nn\n-hexyl, isohexyl (2-methylpentyl), neohexyl (2,2-dimethylbutyl), 3-methylpentyl, 2,3- dimethylbutyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aryls may be monocyclic, C\n5\n-C\n8\n, or polycyclic C\n10\n-C\n18\n, and are optionally substituted with alkyl, carboxy, oxo, amino, alkoxy or aldehyde groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nn may be 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 and preferably 2, 3 or 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chelating agent is for example a pyrazolyl-polyamine of the general formula:\n\n \n \n\nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n and R\n5\n are as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the chelating agent is a pyrazolyl-aminothioether of the general formula:\n\n \n \n\nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n and R\n5\n are as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment the chelating agent is a pyrazolyl-aminophosphine of the general formula :\n\n \n \n\nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n and R\n5\n are as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides more particularly chelating agents of formula I, wherein X and Y are N, R\n6\n is H, C\n1\n alkyl, C\n2\n alkyl, C\n3\n alkyl, C\n4\n alkyl, C\n5\n alkyl or C\n6\n alkyl, monocyclic aryls, preferably phenyl or benzyl, or polycyclic C\n10\n-C\n18\n aryls, optionally substituted with alkyl, carboxy, oxo amino, alkoxy or aldehyde groups, or a biomolecule and R\n1\n, R\n3\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n and R\n5\n are as listed in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment chelating agents of formula I are provided, wherein X is N and Y is S, R\n6\n is H, C\n1\n alkyl, C\n2\n alkyl, C\n3\n alkyl, C\n4\n alkyl, C\n5\n alkyl or C\n6\n alkyl, monocyclic aryls, preferably phenyl or benzyl, or polycyclic C\n10\n-C\n18\n aryls, optionally substituted with alkyl, carboxy, oxo amino, alkoxy or aldehyde groups, or a biomolecule and R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n and R\n5\n are as listed in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another aspect of the invention, chelating agents of formula I are provided, wherein X is N and Y is P, R\n6\n is H, C\n1\n alkyl, C\n2\n alkyl, C\n3\n alkyl, C\n4\n alkyl, C\n5\n alkyl or C\n6\n alkyl, monocyclic aryls, preferably phenyl or benzyl, or polycyclic C\n10\n-C\n18\n aryls, optionally substituted with alkyl, carboxy, oxo amino, alkoxy or aldehyde groups, or a biomolecule and R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n and R\n5\n are as listed in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chelating agents of the invention are particularly suited to link biomolecules with carbonyl moieties in order to arrive at labeled biomolecules having a high specificity for the target. In formula I R\n6\n can thus be a biomolecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe possible positions of the biomolecules (BM) are shown in \n \nFig. 1\n \n \n.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biomolecule can be anything that is useful in the treatment and diagnosis of tumors and can be coupled to the chelators of the invention. The skilled person will be able to establish for which biomolecules the chelators of the invention can be used. In particular the biomolecule is selected from amino acids, peptides, proteins, oligonucleotides, polynucleotides, sugars.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore specifically, the biomolecule is selected from the group consisting of antibodies, ligands of tumor receptors, such as CCK, thioglucose, glucosamine, somatostatin, neurotensin, bombesin, CCK, annexin, interleukins, growth factors, steroid hormones and molecules binding to GPIIb/IIIa receptors. Other biomolecules can be glucose, thioglucose, neurotransmitters, inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase activity such as benzothiopyranones, anilinophthalimides, quinazolines, pyridopyrimidines and pyrrolopyrimidines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA particular agent of the invention is the following:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll of the chelating agents, either with or without a biomolecule coupled thereto can be complexed with a carbonyl moiety of the formula [M(CO)\n3\n]\n+\n, wherein M is rhenium (Re), technetium (Tc) or Manganese (Mn).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chelating agents of the invention are molecules according to formula I wherein X and Y can be either N and N, N and S, or N and P. Each of these combinations can be combined with various combinations of R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n and R\n5\n. All possible combinations of R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n and R\n5\n are listed in \nTable 1.\n In \nTable 1\n alkyl is a C\n1\n alkyl, C\n2\n alkyl, C\n3\n alkyl, C\n4\n alkyl, C\n5\n alkyl or C\n6\n alkyl, in particular selected from methyl, ethyl, \nn\n-propyl, isopropyl, \nn\n-butyl, isobutyl, \ns\n-butyl, \nt\n-butyl, \nn\n-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, \nn\n-hexyl, isohexyl (2-methylpentyl), neohexyl (2,2-dimethylbutyl), 3-methylpentyl, 2,3-dimethylbutyl; the aryl is monocyclic, C\n5\n-C\n8\n, or polycyclic, C\n10\n-C\n18\n, and optionally substituted with alkyl, carboxy, oxo, amino, alkoxy or aldehyde groups and is in particular phenyl or benzyl, and n is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10.

They can also have different substituents and alkyl chains in different positions of the backbone for tuning the physico-chemical properties of the molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA general overview is given in \nFigure 1\n, showing possible combinations for metal fragments of the type [M(CO)\n3\n]\n+\n (M = Re, Tc, Mn).

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention concerns a novel method and composition for the treatment of Meniere's disease, hearing loss and tinnitus.\n\n\n \n\n\nBackground of the invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMeniere's disease, a disorder of the inner ear, afflicts around 0.1-0.5 % of the adult population. The disease is characterized by vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus, and usually begins in the middle life, although it may manifest itself even at lower age. The disease occurs in both sexes at about the same rate. It typically occurs in episodes of marked vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus, lasting for hours up to a few days, but also during the intermittent time periods the patients may suffer from tinnitus and hearing loss. Usually Meniere's disease is unilateral, but with time both ears may become involved, and an estimated 12 percent have bilateral disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the disease tends to be episodic with severe vertigo, nausea and hearing loss and subsequent remissions, with time patients usually suffer from general hearing loss and tinnitus. The remissions may last from a day to several years, but most commonly they last for a few weeks to months. Not uncommonly speech perception is reduced during the attacks. Complete deafness in the affected ear has been reported to occur at a rate of about 10 percent. The individual symptoms of Meniere's disease may vary greatly between patients as may the duration of the remissions, but the disease typically is chronic lasting the whole remaining life from its onset. The disease may impair the working ability and social life of the patients leading to psychological and mental disturbances, and in severe cases patients have even committed suicide because of the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pathophysiology of Meniere's disease is currently not well understood, but it is generally regarded that the pressure of the endolymphatic fluid of the internal ear is pathologically increased leading to a condition called hydrops (swelling of the membraneous labyrinth including the cochlea of the internal ear due to too high pressure). The increased pressure may cause ruptures of the membranes in the labyrinth reducing the increased pressure and thus alleviating the symptoms of the acute attacks. The anatomy of the internal ear is described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn spite of the fact that Meniere's disease is relatively common and disabling there is no causal therapy for the disease. Currently all efforts have to be directed towards symptomatic treatment or to direct destructive treatment of the internal ear by surgical intervention or by administration of ototoxic drugs such as gentamycin into the ear. Thus, Meniere's disease is a significant clinical problem causing much suffering to patients, and consequently a causal therapy for the acute attacks as well as the symptoms during the remissions would be very desirable from a clinical point of view.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTinnitus, the perception of sound in absence of acoustic stimulus, is a very common disorder amongst middle age and elderly people. As many as 10 percent of the middle age / elderly population may suffer from some degree of tinnitus. Most patients complaining of tinnitus however do not suffer from Meniere's disease, but have a local disorder in the organ of Corti which contains the hair cells. These cells transform mechanic energy into electrochemical energy for propagation of the hearing impulses to the brain. The pathophysiologic ethiology of tinnitus is poorly understood. Various causes of tinnitus may include acoustic trauma leading to permanent destruction e.g. of hair cells in the organ of Corti, microvasculopathies in the cochlea, toxic effects of drugs, and infections. Often tinnitus is associated with a hearing loss, which can be determined by audiometry. There are many variants of tinnitus some of which are caused by disorders in the tympanic membrane and external ear and which often can be successfully treated, but usually tinnitus derived from the inner ear is incurable or difficult to treat.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHearing loss or hearing impairment, i.e. the inability to perceive the normal range of sounds audible to an individual with normal hearing, is also a very common disorder. Hearing loss may be greater at some frequencies than others, or all frequencies may be equally affected. The etiology of hearing loss is quite complex, and not fully elucidated. Causative factors may be physical damage to the outer or middle ear, acute or chronic acoustic trauma, ageing, damage to the inner ear or the auditory nerve. It is also not uncommon that hearing loss appears as a sequelae to other diseases or as an unwanted side effect of certain pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present description, examples and claims, the terms hearing loss and tinnitus are used in their widest meaning, as generally understood by a person skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCurrently there are no clinically proven remedies for the treatment of tinnitus or hearing loss, and a drug that could be used to prevent, alleviate or eliminate these symptoms would thus be very desirable from a clinical point of view.\n\n\n \n\n\nAnatomy and physiology of the ear\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ear is divided into three main parts; the external ear, the middle car and the inner ear. The external ear consists of the auricle (pinna) and the ear canal which ends at the tympanic membrane. The middle ear consists of the tympanic membrane, the tympanic cavity, the auditory ossicles and the Eustachian tube. The inner ear, also called the labyrinth because of its complex structure, consists of sacs and tubules suspended in cavities of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. These structures contain a fluid called the endolymph, while the space between the membranous labyrinth and the bone is filled with the perilymph. The bony labyrinth consists of two parts; the vestibule which houses the saccule, the utricle, the semicircular canals, and the cochlea, a spirally coiled structure. The sense of balance is located in the vestibule while the sense of hearing is located in the cochlea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cochlea is a two and three quarters coiled cavity in the bone containing a membranous structure filled with fluid. The cochlear membraneous structure comprises three cavities; the scala vestibuli connected to the oval window and the middle ear ossicles; the scala tympani connected to the round window at the middle ear; and finally the scala media or the cochlear duct being part of the endolymphatic system. The scala vestibuli and scala tympani are parts of the perilymphatic system. The scala media contains the sound perceiving organ, the organ of Corti, a complex structure containing hair cells receiving the hydromechanical energy and converting it to electrochemical signals, supporting cells, a basilar membrane and a tectorial membrane as well as nerve fibres connecting the organ to the nearby situated spiral ganglion. From the spiral ganglion nerve fibres project to the brain for further processing of the auditory signals. The scala media also contains a highly vascularized structure called stria vascularis, and it is regarded that the endolymph of the cochlea is formed in this structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sound reaching the tympanic membrane of the middle ear will cause it to vibrate and the energy is then passed on to the oval window of the inner ear through the ossicles. The energy from the oval window causes a pressure wave in the scala vestibuli to be conveyed through the tip of the cochlea through an opening into the scala tympani which is connected to the round window at the middle ear. This pressure wave in the perilymphatic fluid system causes through the basilar membrane the hair cells to vibrate against the tectorial membrane thus transforming mechanical energy into electrochemical energy. Finally most of the energy from the external sound is released from the cochlea into the middle ear through the round window membrane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe endolymphatic system of the cochlea is connected through ductus reuniens to the endolymphatic system of the sacculus in the vestibular organ. The sacculus is further connected to the utriculus joined by three semicircular canals. The sacculus, utriculus and the semicircular canals have a physiologic function in detecting movements and position and thus relate to the sense of balance. Disorders in this part of the inner ear usually cause symptoms of vertigo often associated with nausea. Both the utriculus and the sacculus are connected through a small canal called the endolymphatic duct to the endolymphatic sac. The endolymphatic duct, a minuscule structure, has a very important function in that the endolymph is believed to be resorbed into the lymphatic and/or blood vessels in this structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus the endolymph is believed largely, if not totally, to be formed in the stria vascularis of the scala media of the cochlea and the wall of the utriculus. It then slowly flows from the cochlea into the sacculus and utriculus to finally end up in the endolymphatic duct and sac where it is resorbed. The endolymphatic duct is a tiny about 2 mm long narrow canal embedded in loose connective tissue in the corresponding bony canal. Lymphatics and blood vessels run through the loose connective tissue. The endolymphatic duct is lined by a single epithelial cell layer and water and solutes have to traverse this cell layer to enter the loose connective tissue. From here the water is resorbed into the lymphatic vessels or the veins because the intraluminal pressure is negative (estimated to -5 to -10 mmHg) compared to the atmospheric pressure (0 mmHg) in the connective tissue stroma and the endolymphatic duct. Thus it is likely that the driving force for the endolymph to leave the endolymphatic duct is largely the difference in hydrostatic pressure between endolymphatic duct and the lymphatic vessels and veins in the connective tissue stroma. The lymphatic vessels empty into the veins. Oncotic pressure gradients are unknown. It is presently regarded that, in Meniere's disease, the resorption of the fluid is impaired leading to increased pressure in the endolympahtic fluid both in the vestibule and the cochlea resulting in typical symptoms such as vertigo, nausea, hearing impairment and tinnitus.\n\n\n \nPrior art\n\n\n \n \n \nThe physiological function of endogenous prostaglandins, particularly PGE\n1\n, PGE\n2\n and PGI\n2\n (prostacyclin) in the cochlea has previously been investigated in many studies, and it has been suggested that these arachidonic acid metabolites may be important in the regulation of the cochlear blood flow (see e.g. Umemura \net al.,\n 1990; Rhee \net al.,\n 1999). While PGF\n2α\n has also been shown to be synthesised in cochlear structures of experimental animals, the physiological function of PGF\n2α\n remains completely unknown (Escoubet \net al\n., 1985; Kawata \net al.,\n 1988; Umemura \net al.,\n 1990), and no effect was observed of PGF\n2α\n on the vasculature in the cochlea. The finding made by the present inventors, that the receptor for PGF\n2α\n (the FP prostanoid receptor) is abundantly distributed in the hair cells and spiral ganglion was therefore very surprising and implies a hitherto unknown function for PGF\n2α\n in the cochlea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreviously prostaglandins have been hypothesised to be involved in the pathophysiological mechanism of a wide variety of diseases such as Meniere's disease, tinnitus, glaucoma, arthritis and bursitis (Rudin, 1980), and indomethacin was found to block the effect of furosemide on the discrimination score of two patients with Meniere's disease possibly suggesting an involvement of undefined prostaglandins in inner ear fluid dynamics (Arenberg and Goodfriend, 1980). Previously it has also been shown in a clinical study that sulprostone, a PGE\n2\n derivative, after 1 hour intravenous infusion produced a short hearing threshold shift similar to that caused by furosemide and it was speculated that PGE\n2\n may be involved in the hearing function (Michel and Matthias, 1992). In addition to this, another synthetic PGE analogue, misoprostol, given systemically has been shown to exert some effect on tinnitus in a clinical study (Briner \net al.,\n 1993). In this study, misoprostol was administered orally.\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription of the invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present inventors have now unexpectedly found that the local administration of prostaglandins has a highly beneficial effect in the treatment of Meniere's disease, tinnitus and hearing loss. These drugs seem to enhance the resorption of the fluid from the endolymphatic duct thus leading to reduced pressure in the endolymphatic space and an alleviation of the symptoms of Meniere's disease. In addition prostaglandins, at least prostaglandins of the F-type, may have a direct beneficial effect in the cochlea because the present inventors have surprisingly found that the FP prostanoid receptor is abundantly expressed in the cochlear region of the inner ear e.g. in the organ of Corti, the spiral ganglion, and the stria vascularis. This finding is particularly interesting from the point of view that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), and indomethacin are known to be ototoxic, and frequently cause tinnitus as side-effect in many patients, and since these drugs block the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes and thus the production of endogenous prostaglandins it is not inconceivable that prostaglandins are important in the cochlea to maintain normal physiological conditions, and that they can be used to treat, alleviate or prevent tinnitus and hearing loss.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExogenous prostaglandins, particularly of the F-type, derivatives thereof, or prostanoid FP receptor agonists administered to the internal ear may thus help to alleviate tinnitus symptoms. As there is no causal therapy for Meniere's disease, tinnitus and/or hearing loss as of today, the findings disclosed in the present description are regarded as particularly valuable from a clinical point of view. Accordingly, the present invention provides the use of prostanoid FP receptor agonists, for example prostaglandins of the F type, for the treatment of Meniere's disease, tinnitus, and/or hearing loss, as well as specific methods and compositions for this use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present inventors have shown abundant expression of the FP prostanoid receptor, but not of the EP prostanoid receptors in the internal ear, and that local application of latanoprost, a PGF\n2α\n analogue and FP receptor agonist, has an unexpected alleviating effect on the tinnitus symptom in Meniere's disease in addition to improving hearing ability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prostanoid FP receptor is a well defined, cloned, sequenced, and pharmacologically characterized entity. Agonists on the receptor accordingly are compounds (for example prostaglandin analogues) that bind and activate the receptor. Selective agonists on the receptor are compounds (for example prostaglandin analogues) that with preference bind and activate the receptor over other prostanoid receptors, in pharmacological terms usually meaning that the difference in EC\n50\n or Kd value between the FP receptor and other prostanoid receptors is at least one log unit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProstaglandins are fatty acids usually derived from the precursors eicosatrienoic, eicosatetraenoic (arachidonic) or eicosapentaenoic acid through metabolic steps involving ring closure and oxygenation catalysed by the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2). The prostaglandins typically carry a cyclopentane ring to which two carbon chains link, the upper usually being called the alpha chain consisting of 7 carbons including a terminal carboxylic acid moiety, while the lower chain usually is called the omega chain and comprises 8 carbons including a terminal methyl group. The prostaglandins have the general structure:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn which the cyclopentane ring (X) may be substituted as shown below:\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the number of double bonds in the chains subscripts of 1 to 3 are used. In prostaglandins with subscript 1 e.g. PGF\n1α\n and PGE\n1\n the double bond is situated between carbons 13 and 14 in the omega chain and exhibits trans configuration in the naturally occurring prostaglandins. In prostaglandins with subscript 2 e.g. PGE\n2α\n and PGD\n2\n an additional double bond in the cis configuration is located between carbons 5 and 6 in the alpha chain. In prostaglandins with the subscript 3, a third double bond is situated between carbon 17 and 18 in the omega chain, exhibiting cis configuration in naturally occurring prostaglandins. The hydroxyl group on carbon 15 in prostaglandins is essential for biologic activity and dehydrogenation of the hydroxyl group to keto markedly reduces the activity/potency of the prostaglandins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProstaglandins are presently used as medicaments for several different disorders, e.g. for the treatment of gastric ulcer, or for prevention of gastric ulcer during NSAID treatment (misoprostol), for the treatment of impotence (alprostadil), for induction of labour and softening of the cervical tissue in the uterus (E and F prostaglandins), as well as for the treatment of glaucoma (latanoprost and isopropyl unoprostone). In particular, prostaglandin esters e.g. the isopropyl or methyl ester have proven advantageous for increasing the bioavailability as well as for stabilisation of the prostaglandins. While many naturally occurring prostaglandins tend to cause irritation e.g. in the eye when applied locally, prostaglandins with a terminal ring-substitution in the omega chain, preferentially 17-phenyl, or 16 phenoxy derivatives of e.g. PGE\n2α\n have been shown to have excellent therapeutic index in the eye (\n \nWO89/03384, Stjernschantz and Resul\n \n), and such compounds are also preferred in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCurrently in particular latanoprost (13,14-dihydro-17-phenyl-18,19,20-trinor-PGF\n2α\n-isopropyl ester), and 16-[(3-trifluormethyl)-phenoxy]-17,18,19,20-tetranor-PGF\n2α\n-isopropyl ester, 17-phenyl-18, 19, 20-trinor- PGF\n2α\n-isopropyl ester, as well as 17-[(3,5-difluoro)-phenyl]-18,19,20-trinor-PGF\n2α\n and esters of these analogues are preferred for use in the treatment of Meniere's disease, tinnitus, and/or hearing loss according to the present invention. Prostaglandin related compounds such as prostamides, e.g. AGN192024 (Bimatoprost) and derivatives and analogues of prostaglandins such as travoprost and isopropyl unoprostone are also compounds that fall under the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus the present invention provides a novel method for the treatment of Meniere's disease, tinnitus, and/or hearing loss, wherein a pharmaceutically effective amount of a prostanoid FP receptor agonist, or an F-type prostaglandin, or a derivative thereof is administered locally to the ear. In particular, the round and/or oval window of the inner ear is contacted with a physiologically acceptable composition comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of a prostanoid FP receptor agonist, or an F-type prostaglandin, or a derivative thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one embodiment of the invention, the prostanoid FP receptor agonist is PGE\n2α\n or a derivative of PGE\n2α\n. According to the invention, the prostaglandin can be substituted in the omega chain with an aromatic or non-aromatic ring structure. The prostaglandin is preferably selected from the group consisting of 13,14-dihydro-17-phenyl-18,19,20-trinor-PGF\n2α\n, 16-[(3-trifluormethyl)-phenoxy]-17,18,19,20-tetranor-PGF\n2α\n, 17-phenyl-18, 19,20-trinor- PGE\n2α\n, and 17-[(3,5-difluoro)-phenyl]-18,19,20-trinor-PGF\n2α\n and alkyl esters and amides thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost preferably the prostaglandin is selected from the group consisting of latanoprost and latanoprost acid, including pharmaceutically suitable salts thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one embodiment of the invention, the prostaglandin is administered in the form of a prodrug. The prostaglandin can for example be administered in the form of an alkyl ester or amide, for example an isopropyl ester or amide, preferably an ethyl amide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the inventive method, a pharmaceutically effective amount of a prostanoid FP receptor agonist, or an F-type prostaglandin, or a derivative thereof is administered to the inner ear 1 - 100 times a year. According to an embodiment of the invention, said compounds are administered to the inner ear continuously or semi-continuously using a medical pump device or in the form of a gel comprising the prostaglandin and a pharmacologically suitable gel forming substance, carrier or matrix, e.g. hyaluronic acid and/or cross-linked hyaluronic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one embodiment of the present invention, said compounds are administered to the inner ear in the form of a slow release drug insert, suitable for placing in the middle air and capable of delivering the active compounds to or in the vicinity of the round and/or oval window.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides the use of a prostaglandin of the F-type, a derivative thereof, or a prostanoid FP receptor agonist for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of Meniere's disease, tinnitus, and/or hearing loss. According to one embodiment, the prostaglandin is PGF\n2α\n or a derivative of PGF\n2α\n. The prostaglandin can also be a prostaglandin substituted in the omega chain with an aromatic or non-aromatic ring structure. Preferably the prostaglandin is selected from the group consisting of 13,14-dihydro-17-phenyl-18,19,20-trinor-PGF\n2α,\n 16-[(3-trifluormethyl)-phenoxy]-17,18,19,20-tetranor-PGF\n2α\n, 17-phenyl-18, 19, 20-trinor- PGE\n2α\n, and 17-[(3,5-difluoro)-phenyl]-18,19,20-trinor-PGF\n2α\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost preferably the prostaglandin is selected from the group consisting of latanoprost and latanoprost acid, including pharmaceutically suitable salts therof. The prostaglandin for the inventive use can also be a prostaglandin in the form of a prostaglandin alkyl ester or amide, for example an isopropyl ester or ethyl amide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition suitable for local administration for the treatment of Meniere's disease, tinnitus or hearing loss comprising a therapeutically active amount of a prostaglandin of F-type, or a prostanoid FP receptor agonist, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In this composition, the carrier is preferably a pharmacologically suitable gel forming substance, carrier or a slow release matrix, for example hyaluronic acid or cross-linked hyaluronic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides a device for the treatment of Meniere's disease, tinnitus, and/or hearing loss, wherein said device is capable of releasing a therapeutically effective amount of a prostaglandin, or prostanoid FP receptor agonist in the middle ear of a human patient during a sustained period of time. This device may be a pump for continuous or intermittent, controlled delivery of the above compounds near or at the round and/or oval window.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nUS 6,045,528\n \n discloses a device for transferring fluids into the inner ear to treat discloses such as Meniere's disease. The invention will be illustrated in closer detail below, in the following non-limiting\n\n\n \nexamples:\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n1. \nIdentification of the FP prostanoid receptor in the inner ear\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAdult albino guinea pigs of either sex weighing 300-500 grams were euthanized with an intraperitoneal injection of a pentobarbital-ethanol solution. The internal ear structures were rapidly dissected out and immersed in 4% fresh formaldehyde solution. The same solution was also perfused through the cochlea and internal ear structures through the oval and round windows. After appropriate fixation the bony tissue underwent decalcification by 8% sodium EDTA treatment for 2-3 weeks. Thereafter the specimens were processed for routine paraffin embedding, and 5-10 µm sections were cut using a microtome. The sections were further processed for immunohistochemistry to demonstrate the FP, EP\n1\n and EP\n3\n prostanoid receptors as well as the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the first extracellular loop of the human FP, EP\n1\n and EP\n3\n prostanoid receptors were used. To detect the COX-1 enzyme polyclonal antibodies against the ovine COX-1 sequence corresponding to amino acids 272-282 were used, and to detect the COX-2 enzyme polyclonal antibodies raised against the murine COX-2 sequence corresponding to amino acids 584-598, were used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunostaining was performed on paraffin sections, which were dewaxed, rehydrated and incubated with trypsin (0.1%) for 15 min in room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 1% H\n2\nO\n2\n in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min in room temperature. After washing in PBS non-specific binding was blocked with 5% normal goat serum (DAKO) for 30 min in room temperature. The primary antibodies were diluted in 0.1 % bovine serum albumin in PBS, either 1:250 (for COX-1 and COX-2 detection), or to 8 µg/ml (for FP, EP\n1\n and EP\n3\n receptor detection), and subsequently incubated with the tissue at room temperature for 60 min. As secondary antibodies coupled to peroxidase EnVision+TM (DAKO Readytouse) was used, and the incubation was carried out for 30 min in room temperature. Diaminobenzidine was used as substrate for the peroxidase and the incubation was carried out for around 10 min in room temperature. The slides were counterstained with Mayer Hematoxylin (Histolab) and mounted with coverslip and examined in a light microscope. Appropriate controls without the specific antibodies were included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular the cochlear structures were examined. Staining for both COX-1 and COX-2 was found to be present in the organ of Corti, and many parts of the cochlea. Generally the COX-1 expression seemed stronger than the COX-2 expression. The FP prostanoid receptor was found to be abundantly expressed in the organ of Corti, including the hair cells themselves, in the spiral ligament and stria vascularis as well as in the spiral ganglion. In addition the FP receptor was detected in the endolymphatic duct region. The staining for the EP\n1\n and EP\n3\n prostanoid receptors was much weaker indicating that these receptors are not strongly expressed in the internal ear in contrast to the FP receptor. Thus the FP prostanoid receptor was detected in the most relevant structures with respect to Meniere's disease, tinnitus, and hearing loss, i.e. in the organ of Corti, stria vascularis, the spiral ganglion and the endolymphatic duct region. The fact that the COX enzymes were found to be expressed at least in the cochlea, indicates that endogenous prostaglandins are likely to have a physiological function in the internal ear, which may be of importance e.g. in treating, alleviating or preventing tinnitus symptoms.\n\n\n \n2. \nDemonstration of the effects of latanoprost on the morphology of the endolymphatic duct structures\n \n\n\n \n \n \nFour pigmented guinea pigs of either sex weighing around 200-300 grams were anaesthetised with pentobarbital for intratympanic (into the middle ear) administration of latanoprost, and for brain stem audiometric measurements. The audiometric measurements were carried out at 8, 16 and 32 kHz frequency before and after the administration of latanoprost (58 µg/ml; a total of 250 µl/injection corresponding to about 14 µg latanoprost) and the vehicle. Latanoprost was administered once daily for three days into one ear, while the other ear received a similar injection of the vehicle only, and on the fourth day the animals were euthanatized with an overdose of the anaesthetic. The middle ears were dissected and the mucus membranes were inspected. Thereafter the inner ear was removed and the labyrinth was perfusion fixated through the oval and round windows with a 3% buffered glutaraldehyde solution. The tissues were then immersion fixated for about 24 hours in the same solution, and decalcified in 0.1 M sodium EDTA solution for about 2 weeks. The tissues were thereafter prepared according to routine techniques for light microscopy, and ultrathin sections of Epon-embedded tissue pieces were cut for transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNo inflammatory changes were detected in the mucous membranes of the middle ear, or in the tympanic membrane in the latanoprost treated or vehicle treated ears, and no morphological changes were detected in the cochlea including the organ of Corti with the hair cells. The brain stem audiograms showed no changes that could be attributed to the treatment with latanoprost or the vehicle. Thus, the mode of administration was technically successful, and latanoprost was well tolerated. Most importantly, in several animals clear-cut changes in the morphology around the endolymphatic duct were detected. These changes comprised a zone of reduced density of the extracellular matrix around fibroblast in the loose connective tissue surrounding the endolymphatic duct. These findings were corroborated by 3 persons. The results indicate that latanoprost has reached the endolymphatic duct and induced the cells to modify the extracellular matrix. Similar effects have previously been seen in the ciliary muscle of the eye after topical treatment with latanoprost and other prostaglandins (Lütjen-Drecoll and Tamm, 1989; Lindsey \net al.,\n 1998; Stjernschantz \net al.,\n 1998). The results indicate that latanoprost as well as other prostaglandins, at least of the PGF\n2α\n type, have the ability to modify the extracellular matrix around the endolymphatic duct which conceivably could reduce the resistance of water flow through the tissue into the lymphatic vessels or the veins, and thus be beneficial in the treatment of Meniere's disease as the pressure in the endolymphatic system would consequently decrease.\n\n\n \n3. \nDemonstration of the beneficial effect of local administration of latanoprost to two patients suffering from Meniere's disease\n \n\n\n \n \n \nA middle aged female and male patient suffering from unilateral Meniere's disease clinically assessed to be of moderate to severe degree were treated with latanoprost (Xalatan\n®\n) once daily for 3 days. About 0.3-0.4 ml of a sterile Xalatan\n®\n (0.005% latanoprost) solution was administered by intratympanic installation in close apposition to the round window after appropriate local anaesthesia. The patients were thereafter asked to lie on the side with the treated ear up for about 30 min to enhance the penetration of latanoprost into the internal ear. The patients had at least 40 decibel decrease in the audiogram at 0.5, 1 and 2 kHz frequency, at baseline before treatment with latanoprost. In addition they suffered from episodes of vertigo and nausea in combination with tinnitus. Audiograms, and cochlear emissions were recorded before the treatment and at the 7\nth\n or 13\nth\n day after the start of the treatment, and information about the subjective symptoms were collected. The audiograms showed no significant change after administration of latanoprost, but the cochlear emissions significantly improved, and the patients experienced a marked improvement in their condition with respect to the tinnitus and hearing ability (Table 1).\n\n \n \nTable 1.\n Data obtained in two patients suffering from Meniere's disease before and after treatment with latanoprost.\n \n \n \nTinnitus was graded as follows: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=marked.

Results of first clinical trial with latanoprost in Meniere's disease\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDuring the priority year, a randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed by the inventors of the present patent application. Nine patients (5 males and 4 females; age 39-65 years) suffering from unilateral Meniere's disease were treated daily for three consecutive days with latanoprost (around 50 micrograms/ml) or placebo adopting a crossover design. Accordingly, each patient was treated with both latanoprost and placebo in random order. Each treatment period lasted for 3 days, and after that the patients were examined at days 5 and 15 from the start of the treatment. Approximately 1 month elapsed between the two treatment periods (washout period). The treatment was given by intratympanic injection (around 0.2-0.8 ml) into the middle ear essentially as described above. Several parameters/symptoms were registered and followed, in particular the following: Pure tone average (decibels), discrimination value (%), tinnitus loudness (decibels), and by using visual analogue scale technique; subjective hearing ability, tinnitus and vertigo. The patients recorded the three last mentioned parameters daily, and the means over the periods 2-5 days and 2-15 days after initiation of treatment with latanoprost and placebo were computed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn three of the nine patients a marked improvement (25-50%) in discrimination value was observed after treatment with latanoprost. Such improvement was never observed during placebo treatment. At day 15 the mean discrimination value after latanoprost treatment was 68.2±7.2 %, while it was 52.9±11.5% after placebo treatment, the difference of 29 % being statistically significant at the p<0.05 level. Likewise, a statistically significant (p<0.01) improvement in pure tone average value at day 15 was found after latanoprost treatment in comparison to placebo, the values being 58.9±3.6 and 64.3±3.5 decibels, respectively (a lower value representing improvement). Finally, at least seven out of the nine patients experienced less vertigo both during the immediate period (days 2-5) after initiation of the latanoprost treatment as well as during a longer period (days 2-15) after the initiation of the latanoprost treatment. The values on the visual analogue scale (in mm; decreasing values reflecting improvement, i.e. less sensation of vertigo) were as follows: Days 2-5 latanoprost treatment: 22.4±9.1, and placebo treatment: 33.5±10.8 (p<0.05); Days 2-15 latanoprost treatment: 24.2±10.0 and placebo treatment: 34.2±11.4 (p<0.05). No statistically significant change was observed in tinnitus loudness, subjective experience of tinnitus, or subjective hearing ability, and variable results were obtained in cochlear emissions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of this study, performed by the present inventors, thus demonstrate a positive effect of the prostaglandin both on the hearing process, in particular the ability to discriminate speech, and on the organ of balance, the vestibular apparatus. The fact that the response to latanoprost treatment varied somewhat between the two first patients and the patients included in the clinical trial may be due to different severity of the disease, different time of examination as well as different study design. However, in both studies clear-cut improvement in inner ear function after latanoprost treatment could be observed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn conclusion, the present inventors have shown in preclinical experiments that the COX enzymes and prostanoid receptors, in particular the FP receptor, are expressed in the relevant structures of the internal ear with respect to Meniere's disease, tinnitus and hearing loss. The present inventors have also shown that intratympanic injection of latanoprost in guinea pigs results in morphological changes in the endolymphatic duct structures reminiscent of increased porosity in the extracellular matrix which can be anticipated to enhance the resorption of endolymphatic fluid. Finally, the present inventors have shown in patients suffering from Meniere's disease a significant clinical improvement after intratympanic latanoprost injection. Thus it is regarded as very likely that prostaglandins have a therapeutic potential in the treatment of patients suffering from Meniere's disease, tinnitus, and hearing loss.\n\n\n \n\n\nMode of administration, pharmaceutical compositions, prostaglandins, and dosages\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe preferred mode of administration is by direct instillation through the tympanic membrane, or by slow infusion using a pump into the middle ear. Pharmaceutical compositions comprise the pharmacologically active principle dissolved in compatible vehicles for the use in the middle ear. Such vehicles may comprise aqueous solutions, certain oil solutions, and compatible ointments, but in particular gels based on a synthetic or natural matrix or carrier, e.g. based on hyaluronic acid, or chondroitin sulphate and other glucosamine glycans. In particular crosslinked hyaluronic acid gels to prevent decomposition of the gel are desirable in order to establish a slow release formulation so that the prostaglandin analogue is released into the internal ear during a sustained period of time e.g. during several weeks, or months, or even longer periods. The vehicle furthermore may contain solubilisers, liposomes and physiologically compatible polymers, e.g. polyvinylalcohole, hydroxymethylcellulose, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulphate and other glucosaminoglycans, to increase viscosity. Furthermore physiologically compatible nanoparticle formulations may also be employed. The formulations may be preserved with compatible preservatives in suitable concentrations for use in the middle ear.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention accordingly provides the use of analogues of PGF\n2α\n and agonists on the FP prostanoid receptor for the treatment of Meniere's disease, tinnitus and hearing loss. In particular latanoprost (13,14-dihydro-17-phenyl-18,19,20-trinor-PGF\n2α\n isopropyl ester), a drug in widespread clinical use for the treatment of glaucoma, and the acid of latanoprost are preferred, including pharmaceutically suitable salts thereof. In addition FP receptor agonists such as fluprostenol and the isopropyl ester of fluprostenol (travoprost), 17-phenyl-18, 19, 20-trinor- PGE\n2α\n, and prodrugs thereof, e.g. the isopropyl ester or the ethyl amid (bimatoprost), as well as 17-[(3,5-difluoro)-phenyl]-18,19,20-trinor-PGF\n2α\n and esters of this analogue are suitable drug candidates. In particular prostaglandin analogues carrying a terminal aromatic or non-aromatic ring substitution on the omega chain such as a phenyl, biphenyl, furyl, thiophene, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cylopentyl, cyclohexyl, and cycloheptyl on carbon 17, or phenoxy-substituted analogues on carbon 16 are preferred, but PGF\n2α\n itself and simpler derivatives and esters of PGF\n2α\n may also be suitable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosages of the different prostaglandin analogues vary depending on the intrinsic activity of each analogue but are in the range of 0.01-1000 µg per day, more typically around 1-100 µg. The prostaglandin should preferentially be administered by a slow release system, such as a gel or insert, but injection through tympanic membrane e.g. once daily or once weekly for a certain period of time may also be employed. Continuous administration using an implanted pump device is also possible, and preferable in particular for long term administration of the compounds. Examples of implantable devices include a refillable, post auricular implantable osmotic pump device connected to the middle ear and the area of the round and/or oval window. Typically the prostaglandin should be administered from once daily to a few times a year depending on the duration of the remissions as well as the release properties of the prostaglandin from the composition. Currently it is not known whether the prostaglandin administration should continue also during the remissions or only be given during the attacks of Meniere's disease. However, for the treatment of tinnitus and hearing loss, continuing administration of the prostaglandin in a slow release formulation at regular intervals e.g. 1 to 12 times a year, or more frequently depending on the severity of the disease is considered necessary.\n\n\n \n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nArenberg, I.K. and Goodfriend, T.L.

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present disclosure relates to novel methods for the detection of substances capable of modulating or inhibiting pathological tau-tau protein association and pathological neurofilament aggregation. The methods of the present invention are particularly useful in screening substances for the prophylaxis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common single cause of dementia in late life (\nLivingstone (1994) The scale of the problem. In: Dementia (eds. Burns and Levy) Chapman & Hall, London, pp.21-35\n). Individuals with Alzheimer's disease are characterised by progressive dementia that presents with increasing loss of memory, disturbances in judgement, perception and speech, and global intellectual deterioration (\nRoth and Iversen (1986) Brit. Med. Bull., 42 (special volume\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe major pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease are senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, both of which contain paired helical filaments (PHFs) of which the microtubule-associated protein tau is a constituent (\nWischik et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85, 4506-4510\n). Plaques also contain β-amyloid fibrils derived from an as yet undefined abnormality in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (\nAPP; Kang et al. (1987) Nature, 325, 733-736\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies of Alzheimer's disease have pointed to loss of the normal microtubule associated protein tau (\nMukaetova-Ladinska et al. (1993) Am. J. Pathol., 143, 565-578\n; \nWischik et al. (1995a) Neurobiol. Ageing, 16: 409-417\n; \nLai et al. (1995b) Neurobiol. Ageing, 16: 433-445\n), accumulation of pathological paired helical filaments (PHFs; Mukaetova-Ladinska et al. (1993), loc. cit.; \nHarrington et al. (1994a) Dementia, 5, 215-228\n; \nHarrington et al. (1994b) Am. J. Pathol., 145, 1472-1484\n; Wischik et al., (1995a), loc. cit.) and loss of synapses in mid-frontal cortex (\nTerry et al. (1991) Ann. Neurol., 30, 572-580\n) as strong discriminatory markers for cognitive impairment. Loss of synapses (Terry et al., loc. cit.) and loss of pyramidal cells (\nBondareff et al. (1993) Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 50, 350-356\n) are both correlated with morphometric measures of tau-reactive neurofibrillary pathology, and this correlates at the molecular level with an almost complete redistribution of the tau protein pool from soluble to polymerised form (PHFs) in Alzheimer's disease (Mukaetova-Ladinska et al. (1993), loc. cit.; Lai et al. (1995), loc. cit.). A possible explanation for these changes is that the pathological redistribution of tau protein into PHFs causes a failure of axonal transport in cortico-cortical association circuits through failure to maintain axonal tubulin in the polymerised state within pyramidal cells (Wischik et al. (1995a), loc. cit.; \nWischik et al. (1995b) Neurobiol. Ageing, in press\n; \nWischik et al (1995c) Structure, biochemistry and molecular pathogenesis of paired helical filaments in Alzheimer's disease. Eds. A. Goate and F. Ashall, in press\n; Lai et al., (1995), loc. cit.). A resulting failure of transport of synaptic constituents from projection soma to distant association neocortex would lead to synaptic loss and cognitive impairment. Further factors include the direct toxicity of PHF accumulation in pyramidal cells (\nBondareff et al., (1993), Arch. Gen. Psychiat. 50: 350-356\n; (\n1994), J. Neuropath. Exp. Neurol. 53: 158-164\n), and the possible direct toxicity of truncated tau accumulation impairing cellular function (\nMena et al. (1991), J. Neuropath. Exp. Neurol. 50: 474-490\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough studies of molecular pathogenesis in model systems have emphasised the neurotoxic role of β-amyloid accumulation (reviewed in \nHarrington and Wischik (1994) Molecular Pathobiology of Alzheimer's disease. In: Dementia (eds. A. Burns and R. Levy). Chapman & Hall London, pp.211-238\n), the evidence linking β-amyloid deposition directly with cognitive impairment in humans is weak. It is more likely that altered processing of APP is only one of several possible factors which might initiate altered processing of tau protein. Other initiating factors include unknown processes associated with apoE4 (Harrington et al. (1994b), loc. cit.), trisomy of chromosome 21 (\nMukaetova-Ladinska et al. (1994) Dev. Brain Dysfunct. 7: 311-329\n), and environmental factors, such as prolonged exposure to sub-toxic levels of aluminium (\nHarrington et al. (1994c) Lancet, 343, 993-997\n). Distinct etiological factors are able to initiate a common pattern of disturbance in tau protein processing which includes: C-terminal truncation at Glu-391, formation of PHF tau polymers, loss of soluble tau, and accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau species (\nWischik et al. (1996) Int. Rev. Psychiat., in press\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fragment of the microtubule-associated protein tau which has been shown to be an integral constituent of the protease-resistant core structure of the PHF is a 93/95 amino acid residue fragment derived from the microtubule binding domain of tau (Wischik et al. (1988), loc. cit.; \nKondo et al. (1988) Neuron, 1, 827-834\n; \nJakes et al. (1991) EMBO J., 10, 2725-2729\n; \nNovak et al. (1993) EMBO J., 12, 365-370\n). Tau protein exists in 6 isoforms of 352-441 amino acid residues in the adult brain (\nGoedert et al. (1989) Neuron, 3, 519-526\n). In general structure the tau molecule consists of an extensive N-terminal domain of 252 residues, which projects from the microtubule, a tandem repeat region of 93-125 residues consisting of 3 or 4 tandem repeats and which is the microtubule binding domain, and a C-terminal tail of 64 residues. Each tandem repeat is composed of a 19 residue tubulin binding segment, and 12 residue linker segment (\nButner and Kirschner (1991) J. Cell Biol., 115, 717-730\n; \nFigure 1\n). The major tau constituent which can be extracted from enriched protease-resistant core PHF preparations is a 12 kDa fragment derived from both 3- and 4-repeat isoforms, but restricted to the equivalent of 3 tandem repeats regardless of isoform (Jakes et al., loc. cit.; \nFigure 2\n). The N- and C-terminal boundaries of the fragment define the precise extent of the characteristic protease-resistant core PHF tau unit. It is phase-shifted by 14/16 residues with respect to the binder/linker organisation of the normal molecule defined by Butner and Kirschner, loc. cit., \nFigure 1\n) and is C-terminally truncated at Glu-391, or at a homologous position in the third repeat of the 4-repeat isoform (Novak et al. (1993), loc. cit.; \nFigure 3\n). A monoclonal antibody (mAb 423) is available which specifically recognises this C-terminal truncation point, and histological studies using this antibody have shown the presence of tau protein C-terminally truncated at Glu-391 at all stages of neurofibrillary degeneration (\nMena et al. (1995) Acta Neuropathol., 89, 50-56\n; \nMena et al. (1996) Acta Neuropathol. (in press\n)). Thus, a possible post-translation modification implicated in PHF assembly is abnormal proteolysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods have been developed which permit discrimination between several tau pools found in AD brain tissues: normal soluble tau, phosphorylated tau, and protease-resistant PHFs (Harrington et al. (1990), (1991), (1994a), loc. cit.). These methods have been deployed in studies of severe AD and Down's Syndrome (Mukaetova-Ladinska et al. (1993; 1995), loc. cit.), in prospectively assessed cases at early stage AD (Wischik et al. (1995a), loc. cit.; Lai et al. (1995), loc. cit.) and cases with other neuropathological diagnoses including senile dementia of the Lewy body type and Parkinson's disease (Harrington et al. (1994a), (1994b), loc. cit.). The overall PHF content in brain tissue distinguishes unambiguously between patients with and without dementia of the Alzheimer type. There is overall a 19-fold difference in PHF content, and in temporal cortex the difference reaches 40-fold. The main site of PHF accumulation is, as expected from histological studies do not differ from aged controls in terms of accumulation either of protease-resistant PHFs or of phosphorylated tau species (Harrington et al. (1994a), (1994b), loc. cit.). Furthermore, apolipoprotein E genotyping of the cortical Lewy body cases showed that the frequency of the E4 allele was raised to a similar extent to that seen in AD. Therefore, the presence of the E4 allele cannot be the sole cause of the characteristic tau pathology of AD, since this was not seen in the Lewy body cases (Harrington et al. (1994b), loc. cit.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further parameter which distinguishes cases with and without AD is the amount of normal soluble tau protein. Although tau levels are higher in white matter than in grey matter, as expected for an axonal microtubule associated protein, the amount found in grey matter also reflects afferent axonal innervation. In AD, there is a substantial loss of normal soluble tau protein which affects all brain regions uniformly (Mukaetova-Ladinska et al. (1993), loc. cit.). The molecular basis of this uniform decline is not known, and cannot be explained by reduced tau mRNA (\nGoedert et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85, 4051-4055\n). The net effect the two processes of accumulation of PHFs and loss of soluble tau is an anatomical redistribution of the tau protein pool, from white matter predominant to grey matter predominant, and from frontal predominant to temporo-parietal prodominant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe global extent of tau protein redistribution in AD can be appreciated from the data shown in \nFigure 4\n, where total free and PHF-bound tau pools are compared. Whereas in controls, 97% of the tau protein pool is in the soluble phase, in AD 87% of the tau protein pool is to be found in the insoluble phase, almost entirely in a form truncated and polymerised into PHFs (Mukaetova-Ladinska et al. (1993), loc. cit.). A study of early stage AD in cases prospectively assessed by the clinical diagnostic instrument CAMDEX (\nRoth et al. (1986) Brit. J. Psych., 149, 698-709\n) and graded post-mortem by the staging criteria of \nBraak and Braak (1991), Acta Neuropathol. 82, 239-259\n) demonstrated that the loss of soluble tau is directly related to the tangle count and to the extent of PHF accumulation (Lai et al. (1995), loc. cit.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough abnormally phosphorylated tau has been considered a possible PHF precursor (\nLee et. al. (1991) Science, 251, 675-678\n; \nGoedert et al. (1994), in Microtubules (Hyams and Lloyd, eds.) pp. 183-200. John Wiley & Sons, NY\n), normal tau has been found to be phosphorylated at many of the sites previously considered abnormally phosphorylated in PHF-associated tau protein (\nMatsuo et al. (1994) Neuron, 13, 989-1002\n). In the study of early stage AD, insoluble hyperphosphorylated tau species were first seen after appreciable tau redistribution into PHFs had occurred (Lai et al., 1995; \nFigure 5\n). There was no evidence of selective accumulation of phosphorylated species prior to the appearance either of PHFs, or of neurofibrillary tangles (Lai et al. (1995), loc. cit.). Likewise, there was no evidence that phosphorylated tau feeds into the total PHF-bound pool during progression of pathology (Lai et al. (1995), loc. cit.). Phosphorylation of tau protein, insofar as it is abnormal, appears to be a secondary process affecting about 5% of PHFs at any stage of pathology (Wischik et al. (1995a), (1995c), loc. cit.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies of early stage Alzheimer's disease also showed that the rate of transfer of soluble tau into PHFs is geometric with respect to the PHF level, with a progressive increase in the rate of incorporation at higher ambient levels of PHFs (Lai et al.(1995), loc. cit.; \nFigure 6B\n). Furthermore, the observed rate of loss of soluble tau with progression of pathology is not enough to account entirely for the observed rate of accumulation of PHFs. Progressively more new tau synthesis is induced as the ambient level of soluble tau falls below 580 pmol/g, and this too feeds into PHF assembly (\nFigure 6A\n). The rate of PHF assembly is therefore not determined by the state or concentration of the soluble precursor, which appears to be entirely normal even in AD (Wischik et al. (1995a), (1995b), loc. cit.). Rather, the rate of transfer of soluble tau into PHFs is determined by the ambient level of PHF-tau, suggesting that the critical post-translational modification responsible for PHF assembly occurs at the point of incorporation of tau into the PHF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA likely explanation for these findings is that tau protein undergoes an induced conformational change at the point of incorporation into the PHF, which is associated with the half-repeat phase shift in the tandem repeat region that has been documented previously (Novak et al. (1993), loc. cit.). This conformational change could expose a high affinity tau capture site which permits the capture and induced conformational modification of a further tau molecule, and so on. The critical conformational change in tau protein which determines the rate of PHF assembly would not then need to be a chemical modification of soluble tau, but an induced conformational change which is produced by the binding of tau protein to a pathological substrate. The process could be initiated by non-tau proteins, such as a product of APP metabolism (\nCaputo et al. (1992) Brain Res., 597, 227-232\n), a modified mitochondrial protein (\nWallace (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91, 8739-8746\n), etc. Once tau capture had been initiated, the process could continue provided the rate of further tau capture exceeded the rate of degradation of the pathological tau complex. Degradation could be limited by the fact that the core tau complex of the PHF is resistant to proteases (Wischik et al. (1988), loc. cit.; Jakes et al., loc. cit.). Such a process, an \"amyloidosis of tau protein\", could be initiated and progress geometrically without any intervening chemical modification of soluble tau protein, as commonly supposed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7\n schematically depicts the transformation of tau protein into PHFs in Alzheimer's disease. The major protein constituent of the PHF core is a form of tau protein which is truncated down to a 93 residue fragment which encompasses a phase-shifted version of the tandem repeat region of the tau molecule which normally functions as the microtubule binding domain. The assembly of the PHF can be envisaged as occurring as a result of a repetitive sequence of events in which pathological tau-tau binding plays a pivotal role. This binding of free tau is favoured at a physiological concentration only in the asymmetrical case in which one tau molecule has already undergone pathological capture (e.g. to a product of APP metabolism (\nCaputo et al. (1992) Neurobiol. Ageing, 13, 267-274\n), or an altered mitochondrial protein (\nJancsit et al. (1989) Cell Motil. Cytoskel., 14, 372-381\n; Wallace, loc. cit.), and further tau binding is enhanced by partial proteolytic processing of the captured species leaving only the truncated tau unit. Once a full-length or truncated unit binds a full-length molecule, partial proteolytic processing of the pathological complex results in the production of a dimer of core tau units, with loss of N- and C-terminal domains of the previously intact molecule(s). The limits of proteolytic processing are determined by the region of tau-tau association, which corresponds precisely to the minimal protease-resistant tau unit we have described (Novak et al. (1993), loc. cit.); see \nFigures 16 and 17\n). However, the end result of this partial proteolysis is to reproduce the core tau unit, which is able to capture a further full-length tau molecule. This process can be repeated indefinitely. It requires two key steps to continue to the point of exhaustion of the available tau protein pool. The first is repeated capture of full-length tau by the truncated unit, the second is truncation of bound full-length tau to reproduce the core unit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSo far, no reliable methods for the measurement of pathological tau-tau association are available and no substances capable of modulating or inhibiting pathological tau-tau association have been described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solutions to the above technical problems are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention describes methods for the detection of agents capable of modulating or inhibiting pathological tau-tau association comprising contacting\n\n \n \n \na) a tau protein or a derivative thereof containing the tau core fragment with\n \nb) an agent suspected of being capable of modulating or inhibiting tau-tau association and with\n \nc) a labelled tau protein or a labelled derivative thereof capable of binding to the tau protein of step a) or with a tau protein or a derivative thereof which is distinct from the tau protein of step a) and also capable of binding to the tau protein of step a) and\n \nd) detection of the tau-tau binding.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe modification of tau which is responsible for its polymerisation into PHFs is propagated by a physical conformational change rather than any preceding chemical post-translational modification of tau. Surprisingly, it is possible to transfer this modification which is induced in vivo at the point of pathological tau capture to the in vitro method according to the above process by initial tau binding to a solid phase. Tau isolated from the brain of the rat neonate was entirely unable to bind to the core tau unit of the PHF (\nFigure 14\n; POTr). But neonatal tau which had been previously bound passively to solid phase matrix , was induced to bind unmodified full-length tau protein with an identical high affinity to that demonstrated with the core tau unit (\nFigures 15\n & \n16\n). Thus, the critical factor required to convert a species of tau incapable of pathological binding, into a species able to capture a further tau molecule with high affinity, is the conformational change induced by passive binding of neonatal tau to the solid phase substrate. This demonstrated that the exposure of the high affinity tau capture site could be induced physically by the conformational change that occurs upon binding of tau to a suitable substrate, and does not require any other chemical modification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the disclosure herein, the pathological binding which is reproduced in vitro had certain critical properties identical to those seen in the human brain. This is in particular that full-length tau protein bound to a core tau unit terminating at Ala-390 (\nFigure 21\n, SEQ ID NO: 4), and therefore lacking the Glu-391 needed for recognition by \nmonoclonal antibody\n 423, could be made to react with \nmAb\n 423 after treatment of the bound tau complex with the broad spectrum protease, Pronase, in a manner that depended quantitatively in the extent of Pronase digestion (\nFigure 16\n). Digestion-dependent loss of N-terminal tau immunoreactivity could be demonstrated to occur in parallel with the acquisition of the \nmAb\n 423 immunoreactivity characteristic of the core PHF (\nFigure 16\n). Thus, the essential requirement needed for the creation of the tau unit isolated from the core of the PHF, and produced in the brain in Alzheimer's disease is the pathological tau-tau interaction which had been reproduced in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, repetitive cycles of binding of full-length tau to the core tau unit terminating at Ala-390, followed by treatment with Pronase, then binding of full-length tau and further Pronase digestion, and so on up to four cycles, was associated with progressive accumulation of tau C-terminally truncated at Glu-391 (\nFigure 17\n), and with progressively enhanced capacity to bind more full-length tau after each cycle (\nFigure 18\n). This demonstrated that the essential role of proteolysis in the model depicted in \nFigure 7\n is to prevent saturation, and hence facilitates the unlimited progressive transformation of soluble tau into the truncated tau units of the core PHF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHaving shown that all the steps depicted in \nFigure 7\n could be reproduced in vitro, and that the critical requirement for progression of the process was the high affinity tau capture step, it is possible to demonstrate the use of the binding assay to find compounds able to block the high affinity tau-tau interaction. Competitive inhibition of 20% could be demonstrated when the most potent inhibitory compounds were present at 1:1 molar ratio with respect to tau, and further inhibition was found to be approximately linear in the range up to 10:1 molar ratio (\nFigure 19\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the tandem repeat region functions as a whole, it is unexpected that it would be possible to demonstrate selective competitive inhibition of pathological tau-tau binding without interference to the normal binding of tau to tubulin via the same region of the molecule. A method of determining any possible interference, i. e. binding of tau or a derivative thereof to tubulin molecules, comprises contacting a depolymerised tubulin preparation, or preparation of taxol-stabilised microtubules with an agent suspected of being capable of modulating or inhibiting pathological tau-tau association and a tau compound mentioned in above step c) followed by detection of the tau-tubulin binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"tau protein\" refers to any protein of the tau protein family mentioned above and derivatives thereof. Tau proteins are characterised as one family among a larger number of protein families which co-purify with microtubules during repeated cycles of assembly and disassembly (\nShelanski et al. (1973) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 70, 765-768\n), and known as microtubule-associated-proteins (MAPs). The tau family in addition is characterised by the presence of a characteristic N-terminal segment which is shared by all members of the family, sequences of - 50 amino acids inserted in the N-terminal segment, which are developmentally regulated in the brain, a characteristic tandem repeat region consisting of 3 or 4 tandem repeats of 31-32 amino acids, and a C-terminal tail (\nFigure 2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment the tau protein comprises the amino acid sequence of \nFigure 21\n (SEQ ID NO: 5), referred to as \"T40\" (\nGoedert et al. (1989), Neuron 3: 519-526\n ), or fragments thereof and comprising the form of the tau protein having 2 N-terminal inserts and 4 tandem repeats.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"tau core fragment\" is defined in its most basic form as tau fragment comprising a truncated tau protein sequence derived from the tandem repeat region which in the appropriate conditions is capable of binding to the tandem repeat region of a further tau protein with high affinity. Ordinarily, preferred tau proteins, tau protein derivatives and tau protein core fragments have an amino acid sequence having at least 70% amino acid sequence identity with the corresponding human tau protein amino acid sequence (\nFigure 21\n, SEQ ID NO: 5), preferably at least 80% and most preferably at least 90% and are characterised in -that they are capable to bind to the human tau core fragment. A particularly advantageous embodiment of the assay method comprises the tau core fragment with the amino acid sequence shown in \nFigure 22\n (SEQ ID NO: 6; Novak et al., 1993). This recombinant tau peptide expressed by E. coli in vitro correspond to species isolated from protease-resistant core-PHF preparations (Wischik et al. (1988), loc. cit.; Jakes et al. (1991), loc. cit.). The term \"tau core fragment\" also includes derivatives thereof as described below and mentioned in \nFigure 25\n and \n26\n (SEQ ID NO: 9 and 10).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"tau protein derivative\" and \"tau core fragment derivative\" comprise fragments of naturally or non-naturally occurring tau proteins and related proteins comprising at least partial amino acid sequences resembling to the tandem repeat region of the tau proteins, i. e. proteins in which one or more of the amino acids of the natural tau or its fragments have been replaced or deleted without loss of binding activity. Examples of naturally occurring proteins with sequence similarity in the tandem repeat region are microtubule-associated proteins (MAP2; \nFigure 25\n and \n26\n; SEQ ID NO: 9 and 10; \nKindler and Garner (1994) Mol. Brain Res. 26, 218-224\n). Such analogues may be produced by known methods of peptide chemistry or by recombinant DNA technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"tau protein derivative\" and \"tau core fragment derivative\" comprise derivatives which may be prepared from the functional groups occurring as side chains on the residues or the N- or C-terminal groups, by means known in the art. These derivatives may include aliphatic esters of the carboxyl groups, amides of the carboxyl groups by reaction with ammonia or with primary or secondary amines, N-acyl derivatives of free amino groups of the amino acid residues formed with acyl moieties (e.g. alkanoyl or carbocyclic aroyl groups) or O-acyl derivatives of free hydroxyl groups (for example that of seryl- or threonyl residues) formed with acyl moieties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe core PHF tau fragment may be isolated from AD brain tissues by the method described in Wischik et al. (1988); (1995a), loc. cit.). The method depends on a series of differential centrifugation steps conducted in empirically determined buffer and density conditions, the final critical centrifugation step being carried out in a continuous sucrose density gradient ranging between 1.05 and 1.18 in density and in the presence of 10 µg/ml of Pronase, to produce a protease-resistant core PHF-fraction at the interface with a high density caesium chloride cushion. Tau protein can be released from the core PHF as an essentially pure preparation in the pH 5.5 supernatant (50 mmol, ammonium acetate) obtained after treating the PHF preparation with concentrated formic acid, lyophilisation, and sonication in pH 5.5 buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNormal soluble tau can be isolated either from AD, control human brain tissues, or from animal brain tissues, with a post-mortem delay of less than 3 hours. Microtubule proteins are obtained by three cycles of temperature-dependent assembly-disassembly according to Shelanski et al. (1973, loc. cit.). Tau protein is purified from the thermostable fraction by gel filtration (\nHerzog and Weber (1978) Eur. J. Biochem., 92, 1-8\n). Alternatively, tau protein can be isolated by the procedure of \nLindwall and Cole (1984; J. Biol. Chem., 259, 12241-12245\n) based on the solubility of tau protein in 2.5% perchloric acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe production of tau proteins and fragments can further be achieved by conventional recombinant DNA technology which are within the skills of an artisan in the field. Such techniques are explained further in the literature, see e.g. \nSambrook, Fritsch & Maniatis \"\nMolecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual\n\" (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, N.Y\n. and \nAusubel et al. \"\nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n\", Green Publish. Association & Wiley Interscience\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, DNA molecules or fragments thereof encoding complete or partial tau proteins may be obtained with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Primers encoding 3' and 5' portions of relevant DNA molecules may be synthesised for the tau protein of interest and can be utilised to amplify the individual members of the tau protein family.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of tubulin proteins or fragments thereof are known in the art and are described e.g. by \nSlobada et al. (1976, in: Cell Mobility (R. Goldman, T. Pollard and J. Rosenbaum, eds.), Cold Spring Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, pp 1171-1212\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA sequences and DNA molecules may be expressed using a wide variety of host/vector combinations. For example, useful expression vectors may consist of segments of chromosomal, non-chromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences. Examples of such vectors are viral vectors, such as the various known derivatives of SV40, bacterial vectors, such as plasmids from E. coli, phage DNAs, such as the numerous derivatives of phage λ, M13 and other filamentous single-stranded DNA phages, as well as vectors useful in yeasts, such as derivatives of the µ plasmid, vectors useful in eukaryotic cells more preferably vectors useful in animal cells, such as those containing SV40, adenovirus and/or retrovirus derived DNA sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"DNA sequence\" refers to a DNA polymer, in the form of a separate fragment or as a component of a larger DNA construct, which has been derived from DNA isolated at least once in substantially pure form, i.e., free of contaminating endogenous materials and in a quantity or concentration enabling identification, manipulation, and recovery of the sequence and its component nucleotide sequences by standard biochemical methods, for example, using a cloning vector. Such sequences are preferably provided in the form of an open reading frame uninterrupted by internal non translated sequences, or introns, which are typically present in eukaryotic genes. However, it will be evident that genomic DNA containing the relevant sequences could also be used. Sequences of non-translated DNA may be present 5' or 3' from the open reading frame, where the same do not interfere with manipulation or expression of the coding regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms \"expression vector\" and \"expression plasmid\" refer to a plasmid comprising a transcriptional unit comprising an assembly of (1) a genetic element or elements having a regulatory role in gene expression, for example, promoters or enhancers, (2) a structural or coding sequence which is transcribed into mRNA and translated into protein, and (3) appropriate transcription and translation initiation and termination sequences. Structural elements intended for use in various eukaryotic expression systems preferably include a leader sequence enabling extracellular secretion of translated protein by a host cell. Alternatively, where recombinant protein is expressed without a leader or transport sequence, it may include an N-terminal methionine residue. This residue may optionally be subsequently cleaved form the expressed recombinant protein to provide a final product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe host cell used for the expression of DNA sequence may be selected from a variety of known hosts. Examples for such hosts are prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. A large number of such hosts are available from various depositories such as the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) or the Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen (DSM). Examples for prokaryotic cellular hosts are bacterial strains such as E. coli, B. subtilis and others. Preferred hosts are commercially available mammalian cells such as mouse 3T3 cells, neuroblastoma cell lines such as NIE-115, N2A, PC-12, or the SV40 transformed African Green monkey kidney cell line COS, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tau protein produced by fermentation of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts transformed with the DNA sequences of this invention can then be purified to essential homogeneity by known methods such as, for example, by centrifugation at different velocities, by precipitation with ammonium -sulphate, by dialysis (at normal pressure or at reduced pressure), by preparative isoelectric focusing, by preparative gel electrophoresis or by various chromatographic methods such as gel filtration, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ion exchange chromatography, reverse phase chromatography and affinity chromatography (e.g. on Sepharose Blue CL-6B or on carrier-bound monoclonal antibodies).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the present disclosure, a tau protein or a fragment thereof containing the tau core fragment is incubated with a tau protein together with an agent suspected of being capable of modulating or inhibiting pathological tau-tau association. The extent of tau-tau binding which is correlated to the capacity of inhibition of the agent may be detected by various methods:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred method a tau protein or a fragment thereof containing the tau core fragment is incubated with a tau derivative which is distinct, preferably immunologically distinct, from the first tau protein. In this case, binding of the tau derivative is detected for example via a poly- or monoclonal antibody or a derivative thereof. An example for this kind of detection is an assay method for the detection of tau-tau binding characterised in that a truncated tau protein corresponding to the core fragment is incubated together with a test substance and either a full-length tau protein or a truncated tau protein fragment simulating the core PHF tau unit in the aqueous phase (\nFigures 8\n and \n10\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this case, tau-tau binding can be detected immunochemically in a conventional manner using an antibody which recognises the N-terminal segment of the full length tau protein or, for example, an antibody such as \nmAb\n 423 which recognises the core tau fragment truncated at Glu-391. Advantageously, the monoclonal antibody itself carries a marker or a group for direct or indirect coupling with a marker as exemplified hereinafter. Also, a polyclonal antiserum can be used which was raised by injecting the corresponding tau antigen in an animal, preferably a rabbit, and recovering the anti-serum by immuno-affinity purification in which the polyclonal antibody is passed over a column to which the antigen is bound and eluting the polyclonal antibody in a conventional manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA particularly advantageous embodiment of the method of the present disclosure comprises the use of an antibody directed against a human-specific segment between Gly-16 and Gln-26 near the N-terminus of the tau protein. The use of this kind of antibody makes it possible to measure binding of full-length recombinant human tau to full-length tau isoforms derived from other animal species, for example rat, at various stages of development. The binding of truncated tau can be detected by using an antibody such as \nmAb\n 423 to detect a truncated core tau fragment terminating at Glu-391 binding to a similar fragment terminating at Ala-390 not recognised by \nmAb\n 423. (\nFigure 8\n)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies or fragments thereof may be used in any immunoassay system known in the art including, but not limited to: radioimmuno-assays, \"sandwich\"-assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), fluorescent immuno-assays, protein A immunoassays, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly preferred is the following configuration for tau-tau binding assays (\nFigure 10\n): A tau fragment, preferably a recombinant tau fragment, corresponding to the truncated tau unit of the core PHF is bound to a solid phase, e.g. a conventional ELISA plate, in buffer conditions which have been shown not to favour tau-tau association. The truncated tau protein is preferably bound passively to the solid phase, since this has been found to expose the high affinity tau-tau binding site within the tandem repeat region. The solid phase is usually poly(vinylchloride), but may be other polymers such as cellulose, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene or polypropylene. The solid supports may be in the form of tubes, beads, discs or micro plates, or any other surfaces suitable for conducting an assay, and which on passive binding of tau protein, exposes the high affinity tau capture site. Following binding, the solid phase-antibody complex is washed in preparation for the test sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly, appropriate buffer conditions for binding of the truncated tau unit of the core PHF to a solid substrate without self-association and without disturbance to the high affinity tau capture site within the tandem repeat region could be determined. An assay system was established as shown in \nFigure 8\n, in which the core tau unit truncated at Ala-390 was first bound to the solid phase matrix. Next, a truncated unit terminating at Glu-391 was incubated. Only the latter could be detected as \nmAb\n 423 immunoreactivity. \nFigure 9\n demonstrates the specificity of the assay, in that \nmAb\n 423 immunroeactivity is seen only in the condition in which tau-tau binding is expected. An alkaline buffer- (sodium carbonate, tris, etc.), preferably pH 9 - 10, e.g. sodium carbonate buffer (50 mM, pH 9.6) was found to be associated with negligible self association of core tau units (\nFigure 9\n). Therefore plating of the core tau unit for passive binding to solid phase matrix was carried out in this buffer. If desired, a depolymerised tubulin preparation or a preparation of microtubules in the same buffer can be plated for passive binding for determination of tau-tubulin binding. Suitable agents for blocking excess binding sites are milk extract, bovine serum albumin, gelatine, etc. After transfer of the solid phase bound core tau unit to physiological buffer conditions and incubation with full-length tau in the standard binding assay format (\nFigure 10\n), it was possible to demonstrate extremely high affinity capture of normal full-length tau protein. No binding of full-length tau was seen without prior plating of the core tau unit in the solid phase. When both species were present, binding was seen to depend on concentration of both species. It was found that when either the solid-phase or aqueous phase species was saturating, the binding constant for the other species was 8 - 25 nM, depending on the particular isoform of tau measured (\nFigure 11\n). The buffer conditions for tau-tau binding should comprise suitable salt concentrations and suitable pH values (\nFigure 12\n and \n13\n). The salt concentrations for tau-tau binding should amount to preferably 50 to 400 mM sodium chloride, more preferably 100 to 200 mM sodium chloride or a corresponding salt or salt mixture with a comparable ionic strength, e.g. PBS (137 mM sodium chloride, 1.47 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 8.1 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 2.68 mM potassium chloride). The pH range should comprise pH values of \npH\n 4 to \npH\n 10 and more preferably \npH\n 5 to \npH\n 8. In order to saturate excess binding sites and to avoid non specific binding the solid phase may be incubated with a blocking agent, e.g. milk extract, bovine serum albumin or preferably gelatine. After transfer of the passively bound core tau unit to physiological buffer conditions, it was possible to demonstrate extremely high affinity capture of normal full-length tau protein (Kd = 8 - 25 nM, depending on the particular tau species tested).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA liquid phase containing a tau protein capable of binding to the tau protein of the solid phase is added together with the test substance to the solid phase tau protein for a period of time sufficient to allow binding. The bound tau complex is again washed in preparation for addition of the antibody which selectively detects the secondarily bound tau species, but not the initial solid-phase species. The antibody is linked to a reporter molecule, the visible signal of which is used to indicate the binding of the second tau protein species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, detection of binding may be performed with a second antibody capable of binding to a first unlabelled, tau specific antibody. In this case, the second antibody is linked to a reporter molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"reporter molecule\", as used in the present specification is meant a molecule which by its chemical nature, provides an analytically detectable signal which allows the detection of antigen-bound antibody. Detection must be at least relatively quantifiable, to allow determination of the amount of antigen in the sample, this may be calculated in absolute terms, or may be done in comparison with a standard (or series of standards) containing a known normal level of antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe most commonly used reporter molecules in this type of assay are either enzymes or fluorophores. In the case of an enzyme immunoassay an enzyme is conjugated to the second antibody, often by means of glutaraldehyde or periodate. As will be readily recognised, however, a wide variety of different conjugation techniques exist, which are well known to the skilled artisan. Commonly used enzymes include horseradish- peroxidase, glucose oxidase, β-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase, among others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe substrates to be used with the specific enzymes are generally chosen for the production, upon hydrolysis by the corresponding enzyme, of a detectable colour change. For example, p-nitrophenyl phosphate is suitable for use with alkaline phosphatase conjugates; for peroxidase conjugates, 1,2-phenylenediamine or tetramethylbenzidine are commonly used. It is also possible to employ fluorogenic substrates, which yield a fluorescent product rather than the chromogenic substrates noted above. In all cases, the enzyme-labelled antibody is added to the corresponding tau-tau protein complex and allowed to bind to the complex, then the excess reagent is washed away. A solution containing the appropriate substrate, hydrogen peroxide, is then added to the tertiary complex of antibody-antigen-labelled complex. The substrate reacts with the enzyme linked to the antibody, giving a qualitative visual signal, which may be further quantitated, usually spectrophotometrically, to give an evaluation of the amount of antigen which is present in the serum sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternately, fluorescent compounds, such as fluorescein or rhodamine, may be chemically coupled to antibodies without altering their binding capacity. When activated by illumination with light of a particular wavelength, the fluorochrome-labelled antibody absorbs the light energy, inducing a state of excitability in the molecule, followed by emission of the light at a characteristic longer wavelength. The emission appears as a characteristic colour visually detectable with a light microscope. As in the enzyme immunoassay (EIA), the fluorescent-labelled antibody is allowed to bind to the first antibody-tau-peptide complex. After washing the unbound reagent, the remaining ternary complex is then exposed to light of the appropriate wavelength, and the fluorescence observed indicates the presence of the antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment, the second tau protein species which is added in liquid phase together with a test substance may be linked to a reporter molecule as mentioned above. The second tau species may be directly modified (e.g. marked with a radioactive or enzymatically detectable label) or conjugated (e.g. to a fluorophore) in a domain of the molecule, for example the N-terminal segment, which is known not to be involved in the high affinity tau-tau binding site, and thereby itself function both as the ligand in the tau-tau binding assay, and as the reporter molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA particular preferred embodiment of the present disclosure is described in detail in Example 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies or fragments thereof used in the method of the present disclosure may be produced by conventional techniques, i.e. monoclonal antibodies which are selective to tau epitopes may be prepared by the method of Köhler and Milstein. Suitable monoclonal antibodies to tau epitopes can be modified by known methods to provide Fab fragments or (Fab')\n2\n fragments, chimeric, humanised or single chain antibody embodiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples for monoclonal antibodies being useful both to measure binding affinity in the tau-tau interaction, and to demonstrate the immunochemical relationship between the binding demonstrated in vitro and that which occurs in the human brain are presented in the following:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies recognising an N-terminal or C-terminal tau epitope permit measuring of binding between truncated and full length tau species. Especially useful are antibodies recognising human specific epitopes. A monoclonal antibody (designated AK 499) recognises a human specific epitope located in the region between Gly-16 and Gln-26 of tau, and thereby also permits measurement of binding between full-length tau species, provided one is derived from a non-human source (\nLai (1995) The role of abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein in the development of neurofibrillary pathology in Alzheimer's disease. PhD Thesis, University of Cambridge\n). \nAntibody\n 342 recognises an non-species specific generic tau epitope located between Ser-208 and Asn-265 (\nFigure 21\n, SEQ ID NO: 4) which is partially occluded in the course of the tau-tau interaction (Lai, loc. cit.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther useful antibodies have already been described: \nantibody\n 423 recognises tau C-terminally truncated at Glu-391 (Novak et al. (1993), loc. cit.). This truncation occurs naturally in the course of PHF assembly in Alzheimer's disease (Mena et al. (1995), (1996), loc. cit.; Novak et al. (1993), loc. cit.; Mena et al. (1991), loc. cit.). The same C-terminal truncation can be demonstrated in vitro after binding of full-length tau to a truncated tau fragment terminating at Ala-390, which is not recognised by mAb 423 (Novak et al. (1993), loc. cit.), followed by digestion with the broad-spectrum protease, Pronase (\nFigure 16\n). In this configuration, the only possible source of \nmAb\n 423 immunoreactivity is from digestion of bound full-length tau, and this can be shown to increase in a concentration-dependent manner with increasing Pronase (\nFigure 16\n). This demonstrates that the molecular conformation of the tau-tau binding interaction generated in vitro corresponds precisely to that which occurs in the brain, and hence that selective inhibition of binding demonstrated in vitro can be generalised to the human brain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody 7.51 recognises a generic tau epitope located in the antepenultimate repeat of tau (\nNovak et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88, 5837-5841\n), which is occluded when tau is bound in a PHF-like immunochemical configuration but can be exposed after formic acid treatment (Harrington et al. (1990), (1991), loc. cit.; Wischik et al. (1995a), loc. cit.). Normal soluble tau, or tau bound to microtubules, can be detected by mAb 7.51 without formic acid treatment (Harrington et al. (1991), loc. cit.; Wischik et al. (1995a), loc. cit.). Binding of full-length tau in the tau-tau binding assay is associated with partial occlusion of the mAb 7.51 epitope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhenothiazines were identified which produced an inhibition of binding with a Ki of 98 - 108 nM (\nFigure 19\n). Inhibition of 20% can be demonstrated at 1:1 molar ratio with respect to tau, and further inhibition is approximately linear in the range up to 10:1 molar ratio. These findings are consistent with the following assumptions: tau-tau binding is determined by a finite number of saturable binding sites, and hence is specific; there is no co-operativity, i.e. that the binding of one molecule of tau does not influence the binding of a further molecule of tau at the site at which inhibition occurs; binding is reversible, and is in a state of dynamic equilibrium in which binding is determined only by concentration and binding affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGiven that the tandem repeat region of tau normally functions as the tubulin binding domain, and that the same region of the molecule also contains the high affinity tau capture site responsible for PHF assembly, it would only be possible to envisage a pharmaceutical intervention to prevent pathological binding of tau if a more subtle molecular difference could be demonstrated between the two types of binding, which would permit selective inhibition of pathological tau-tau interaction, without inhibition of normal tau-tubulin binding, since many normal cellular processes, including particularly axonal transport of synaptic vesicles (\nOkabe and Hirokawa (1990) Nature, 343, 479-482\n), are dependent on the capacity of the cell the maintain tubulin in the polymerised state. Prior experiments demonstrated immunochemical differences (occlusion of the mAb 7.51 epitope in the tau-tau binding interaction, but no occlusion in the tau-tubulin binding interaction; Harrington et al. (1991), loc. cit.; Novak et al. (1991), loc. cit.) and molecular differences (tau bound in a PHF-like configuration shows a 14/16 amino acid residue phase-shift with respect to the normal tubulin-binding segment / linker segment organisation of the tubulin binding domain which can be demonstrated by characteristic N- and C-terminal proteolytic cleavage sites; Novak et al. (1993), loc. cit.; \nFigure 3\n). Surprisingly, these differences could also provide a basis for pharmaceutical discrimination using small molecules within well-established pharmaceutical classes. In particular, the effects of the phenothiazines which were shown to inhibit pathological tau-tau association were tested for inhibition of normal tau-tubulin binding. Essentially no inhibition of binding could be demonstrated up to a molar ratio of 1000 : 1 with respect to tau (\nFigure 20\n). Nevertheless, hyperphosphorylation of tau, which has been shown to inhibit the tau tubulin-binding interaction, was also shown to produce comparable inhibition in this tau-tubulin binding assay (Lai, loc. cit.). Thus, compounds provided by the present invention which inhibit pathological tau-tau association do not inhibit normal binding of tau to tubulin. This represents the critical discovery of the present invention, since it demonstrates the technical feasibility of discovering compounds on the basis of the screening system described herein which can distinguish pharmaceutically between the pathological binding of the tandem repeat region in the PHF and the normal binding of the tandem of the tandem repeat region in the tau-tubulin interaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe only microtubule-associated protein identified so far within the PHF core is tau protein. Nevertheless, PHFs assemble in the somatodendritic compartment where the predominant microtubule-associated protein is MAP2 (\nMatus, A. In Microtubules (Hyams and Lloyd , eds) pp 155-166, John Wiley and Sons, NY\n). MAP2 isoforms are almost identical to tau protein in the tandem repeat region, but differ substantially both in sequence and extent of the N-terminal domain (\nFigures 25\n and \n26\n, SEQ ID NO: 9 and 10). As shown in Example 3 aggregation in the tandem-repeat region is not selective for the specific tau core amino acid sequence, and the inhibitory activity of phenothiazine inhibitors such as thionine is not dependent on sequences unique to tau.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the present disclosure also relates to the corresponding in vivo methods. These methods refer to the screening for agents that modulate or inhibit pathological tau-tau association characterised in contacting a cell line transfected either with tau protein or a derivative thereof containing the tau core fragment or with a vector capable of expressing a tau protein or a derivative thereof containing the tau core fragment with an agent suspected of being capable of modulating or inhibiting tau-tau association followed by detection of the cell line viability and/or the cell line morphology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExample 4 and 5 reveal that fibroblasts are fully viable when expressing transgenic full-length tau protein and the cytoskeletal distribution of transgenic full-length tau protein is not disturbed by culturing cells with a potent tau-tau binding inhibitor. The phenothiazine thionine does not appear to have substantial intrinsic toxicity. But fibroblasts are either not viable or show gross morphological abnormalities when expressing the transgenic core tau unit of the PHF. The frequency of viable transfectants and the expression level for truncated tau are increased in a dose-dependent manner by growing cells in thionine following transfection. Viable transfectants expressing truncated tau are dependent on thionine, and revert to abnormal forms with low viability upon its withdrawal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese findings therefore substantiate in a non-neuronal cell system the major findings of the present invention, namely: that high levels of PHF-core tau within the cell are toxic; that this toxicity can be reversed by compounds which are selective inhibitors of the pathological tau-tau binding interaction; and that such compounds do not disrupt the normal binding of tau to tubulin in vivo. These findings are generaliseable to other experimental models, including inducible transfection systems and direct transfection of cells with truncated tau protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the foregoing results support the use of tau-tau binding inhibitors in reversing the toxicity of the truncated tau unit, it is desirable to establish neuronal models of these processes. In general, neuroblastoma cell lines undergo complex cytoskeletal changes in the course of differentiation which depend on a balance between the development of the microtubule-network and a corresponding development of the neurofilament network. Higher molecular weight microtubule-associated proteins (MAP1A, MAP1B) are thought to provide cross-bridges between these cytoskeletal systems (\nSchoenfield et al. (1989) J. Neurosci. 9 , 1712-1730\n). Direct interference with the microtubule-system with depolymerising agents (\nWisniewski and Terry (1967) Lab. Invest. 17, 577-587\n) or aluminium (\nLangui et al. (1988) Brain Res. 438, 67-76\n) is known to result in intermediate filament collapse with formation of characteristic whorls in the cytoplasm (\nWischik and Crowther (1986) Br. Med. Bull. 42, 51-56\n). A similar aggregation of the neurofilament cytoskeleton can be seen to occur spontaneously in neuroblastoma cell lines which fail to differentiate. The role of MAPs in the formation of these aggregates is not at present understood. However, the formation, accentuation and inhibition of these aggregates represent indirect markers of the capacity of microtubular cytoskeleton to associate with and transport the neurofilament cytoskeleton into newly formed neurites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples 6 and 7 reveal that phenothiazine inhibitors like thionine are not toxic for neuronal cell lines at concentrations up to 2 µM and thionine does not interfere with incorporation of transgenic tau protein into the endogenous microtubule network. These phenothiazines are required for production of viable neuronal cell lines following stable transfection with a plasmid expressing truncated tau. Moreover, constitutive expression of truncated tau accentuates the formation of pNFH aggregates, whereas the latter is inhibited by expression of full-length tau. The formation of cytoplasmic pNFH aggregates is inhibited by phenothiazines like thionine and incorporation of pNFH immunoreactivity into neuronal processes is facilitated by these compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese findings demonstrate that stable transfection of neuronal cell lines with truncated tau is inherently toxic and, by destabilising the microtubule system in surviving cells, results in the formation of presumptive neurofilament aggregates which fail to be transported into developing neurites. These effects can be inhibited by a compound selected for its capacity to block tau-tau aggregation in vitro, and this action is presumably mediated by a permissive effect on expression of endogenous tau or other MAPs required to stabilise microtubules. Phenothiazines like thionine also have the unexpected capacity to block neurofilament aggregation in untransfected cells, either by facilitating neuronal differentiation, or by directly inhibiting the formation of neurofilament aggregates. In addition to their potential utility in prevention of tau aggregation in Alzheimer's disease, such compounds may have additional potential utility in the treatment of diseases characterised by pathological neurofilament aggregation, such as motor neuron disease and Lewy body disease. Transgenic mice which overexpress neurofilament subunits have been found to develop neurofilament aggregates selectively in large motor neurones which undergo degeneration, leading to muscle wasting and weakness (\nCote et al. (1993) Cell 73, 35-46\n; \nXu et al. (1993) Cell 73, 23-33\n). Other neurodegenerative disorders, Pick's disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, show accumulation of pathological truncated tau aggregates respectively in Dentate Gyrus and in stellate pyramidal cells of the neocortex. The compounds which have been described also have utility in these neurodegenerative disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present disclosure especially relates to the above in vivo method wherein said cell line preferably is a fibroblast or a neuronal cell line, more preferably a fibroblast 3T3, a PC-12 or a NIE-115 cell line. These cell lines are transfected preferably with a truncated tau protein, containing at least the core tau unit. The expression of the tau protein may be under constitutive or under inducible control or the tau protein species may be directly transfected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention refers to compounds which modulate or inhibit tau-tau association as obtainable by a any method described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the above results, the present invention provides also the use of phenothiazines of the formula wherein:\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\nwherein:\n\n \n \n \nR\n1\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n and R\n9\n are independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, carboxy, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, haloalkyl or alkoxy;\n \nR\n5\n, each R\n10\n and each R\n11\n are independently selected from hydrogen, hydroxy, carboxy, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, haloalkyl or alkoxy;\n \n\nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,\n\nfor use in the prophylaxis or treatment of a neurodegenerative disease of pathological tau-tau aggregation by inhibition of said pathological tau-tau association without inhibition of normal tau-tubulin binding.\n    \n \n \n \nThe term \"alkyl\" as used herein refers to straight or branched chain groups, preferably having one to eight, more preferably one to six, carbon atoms. For example, \"alkyl\" may refer to methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, tert-pentyl, hexyl, isohexyl, and the like. Suitable substituents for the substituted alkyl groups used in the invention include the mercapto, thioether, nitro, amino, aryloxy, halogen, hydroxyl, and carbonyl groups as well as aryl, cycloalkyl and non-aryl heterocyclic groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"alkoxy\" refers to groups as defined herein above as alkyl groups, as the case may be, which also carry an oxygen atom interposed between them and the substrate residue to which they are attached.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"haloalkyl\" represents a straight or branched alkyl chain having from one to four carbon atoms with 1, 2 or 3 halogen atoms attached to it. Typical haloalkyl groups include chloromethyl, 2-bromethyl, 1-chloroisopropyl, 3-fluoropropyl, 2,3-dibrombutyl, 3-chloroisobutyl, iodo-t-butyl, trifluoromethyl and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \"halogen\" represents fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome compounds of the invention possess one or more asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms and therefore exist in racemic and optically active forms. The invention is intended to encompass the racemic forms of the compounds as well as any of the optically active forms thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are formed between basic compounds of formula (I) and inorganic acids, e.g. hydrohalic acids such as hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid etc., or organic acid, e.g. acetic acid, citric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEspecially preferred are following phenothiazines :\n\n \n \n \na) Toluidine Blue O\n\n \n \n \n \nb) Thionine\n\n \n \n \n \nc) Azure A\n\n \n \n \n \nd) Azure B\n\n \n \n\nand\n \ne) 1,9-Dimethyl-Methylene Blue\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nPreferred compounds useful for the blocking of pathological tau-tau association, preferably phenothiazines (\nFigures 23\n and \n24\n), are characterised by a binding coefficient of less than 0.4, and lack of inhibition in the tau-tubulin binding assay, preferably up to a molar ratio of 1000:1 with respect to the molar concentration of tau.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phenothiazines of the present invention are known in the art and may be manufactured by the processes referred to in standard texts (e.g. \nMerck Manual, Houben-Weyl, Beilstein E III/\n, \nJ. Heterocycl. Chem 21, 613 (1984\n), etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the above formula, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or other compounds found to have the properties defined in the assays provided, could be used as medicaments after further testing for toxicity (e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations). The prior pharmaceutical use of methylene blue in a wide range of medical indications has been described, including treatment of methaemoglobineamia and the prophylaxis of manic depressive psychosis (\nNaylor (1986) Biol. Psychiatry 21, 915-920\n), and CNS penetration following systemic administration has been described (\nMüller (1992) Acta Anat., 144, 39-44\n). The production of Azure A and B occur as normal metabolic degradation products of methylene blue (\nDisanto and Wagner (1972a) J. Pharm. Sci. 61, 598-602\n; \nDisanto and Wagner (1972b) J. Pharm. Sci. 61, 1086-1094\n). The administration of pharmaceuticals can be effected parentally such as orally, in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions), nasally (e.g. in the form of nasal sprays) or rectally (e.g. in the form of suppositories). However, the administration can also be effected parentally such as intramuscularly or intravenously (e.g. in the form of injection solutions).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the manufacture of tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic excipients. Lactose, maize starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc. can be used, for example, as such excipients for tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable excipients for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable excipients for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, saccarose, invert sugar, glucose etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable excipients for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable excipients for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preserving agents, solubilizers, viscosity-increasing substances, stabilising agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, sweetening agents, colouring agents, flavouring agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, coating agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the invention the compounds of the above formula and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used in the treatment or prophylaxis of Alzheimer's disease, by inhibiting of pathological tau-tau association. The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral administration there should suffice a daily dosage of about 50 mg to about 700 mg, preferably about 150 mg to about 300 mg, divided in preferably 1-3 unit doses, which can, for example, be of the same amount. It will, however, be appreciated that the upper limit given above can be exceeded when this is found to be indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention can be understood better when they are read in conjunction with the accompanying figures:\n\n \n \n \n \nFigure 1\n: Representation of tau protein binding to microtubules (modified after Butner and Kirschner, loc. cit.).\n \n \nFigure 2\n: Schematic representation of tau protein isoforms, with corresponding amino acid and cDNA sequences shown in \nFigure 21\n. The N-terminal domain of 252 residues contains either one or two inserts amounting to a further 58 residues (\"1\", \"2\"), followed by a tandem repeat region of 93 - 125 residues containing 3 or 4 tandem repeats, and a C-terminal tail of 64 residues. The tau fragments isolated from enriched protease-resistant PHF-core preparations are named \"F5.5\", and consist of a mixture of species derived from both 3- and 4-repeat isoforms, but encompassing 93 - 95 residues, the equivalent of 3-repeats, phase shifted by 14 - 16 residues with respect to the normal organisation of the tandem of tandem repeat region. All F5.5 species and normal tau are recognised by mAb 7.51, but \nmAb\n 423 recognises only those F5.5 fragments terminating at \nGlu\n 391. The positions of epitopes for mAb's 499, AT8 and 342 are also shown.\n \n \nFigure 3\n: N-terminal sequence analysis of the 12 kDa F5.5 fragment released from core PHF preparations revealed the presence of 6 distinct peptides which can be grouped into 3 pairs derived from 3-repeat (A: repeats 1-3; SEQ ID NO: 1) or 4-repeat (B: repeats 1-3; SEQ ID NO: 2, or C: repeats 2-4; SEQ ID NO: 3) isoforms (Jakes et al., loc. cit.). mAb423 immunoreactivity serves to define a C-terminal boundary at Glu-391 (shown by arrow, Novak et al.(1993), loc. cit.). The N- and C-terminal boundaries thus serve to define a phasing of the tandem repeat region within the PHF core which is shifted 14 - 16 residues with respect to the sequence homology repeats. This minimal protease resistant core PHF tau unit is 93/95 residues long which is precisely equivalent to 3 repeats. The boundaries of this unit are also out of phase with respect to the tubulin binding domains proposed by Butner and Kirschner (loc. cit.), which are shown underlined.\n \n \nFigure 4\n: Total tau protein content in controls and Alzheimer's disease. Normal soluble tau (white) is the predominant form found in controls, whereas in Alzheimer's disease, the predominant form of tau is polymerised into PHFs (black).\n \n \nFigure 5\n: Changes in soluble tau, phosphorylated tau, and tangle count during early stages of Alzheimer's disease (Lai et al. (1995), loc. cit.). The accumulation of PHF-bound tau is shown on the horizontal axis. This is accompanied by a relative loss in normal soluble tau. The first appearance of phosphorylated tau is closely linked to the first appearance of tangles. However, both of these appear only after a substantial redistribution of tau from soluble to polymerised phases has already occurred.\n \n \nFigure 6\n: Calculated rates of transfer of new tau synthesis into the soluble tau pool (a), and of soluble tau into the PHF-bound pool (b) at early stages of Alzheimer's disease (Lai et al. (1995), loc. cit.). As the soluble tau level drops below 580 pmol/g, progressively more new tau synthesis is required to keep pace with the rate of PHF production, and this appears to be regulated in a negative feedback manner with respect to the ambient level of soluble tau (a). The rate of transfer of soluble tau into PHFs is geometric with respect to the ambient level of PHF-tau (b).\n \n \nFigure 7\n: Hypothetical scenario for transformation of tau protein into PHFs in Alzheimer's disease. Once tau has been immobilised and truncated, a high affinity pathological tau capture site is exposed. When a further molecule of tau is captured, only partial proteolytic degradation is possible, since the region of high affinity tau-tau association is protected from proteolysis, leaving a further high affinity tau capture site available for the capture of a further tau molecule. The redistribution of the tau protein pool from soluble to truncated PHF-bound phases is autocatalytic, mediated by repetitive high affinity tau capture and partial proteolysis.\n \n \nFigure 8\n: Tau binding assay configuration in which binding of two truncated units is measured. The species terminating at Ala-390 (\"a\") is first coated on the ELISA plate (in sodium carbonate buffer: 50 mM, pH 9.6). Next, a second truncated tau species terminating at Glu-391 (\"e\") is incubated in various buffer conditions shown in \nFigure 9\n. Only the species \"e\" is recognised by \nmAb\n 423, and hence \nmAb\n 423 immunoreactivity measures only that tau which is bound during the second incubation.\n \n \nFigure 9\n: Binding of species \"e\" (0 or 20 µg/ml) to \"a\" (0 or 10 µg/ml) in phosphate buffered normal saline (\"normal\"), distilled water (\"water\") and sodium carbonate buffer (\"carbonate\", 50 mM, pH 9.6). The vertical axis shows \nmAb\n 423 immunoreactivity. No immunoreactivity is detected when species \"a\" is coated alone, because \nmAb\n 423 does not recognise \"a\". No immunoreactivity is detected when \"e\" is incubated without prior plating of \"a\". This is because the blocking conditions used prevent non-specific binding of \"e\" to the ELISA plate. Immunoreactivity is only seen in the condition in which \"a\" and \"e\" are both present, demonstrating the specific detection only of \"e\" which is has been bound to \"a\". No binding is seen when \"e\" is added in sodium carbonate buffer. Therefore, this condition represents the optimal one for initial plating of \"a\", since self-aggregation is minimised in this condition.\n \n \nFigure 10\n: Standard configuration for measurement of binding of full-length tau (\"t\") to the truncated core tau unit previously bound passively to the solid phase (\"a\"). A recombinant tau fragment (\"a\") corresponding to the truncated tau unit of the core PHF is plated at varying concentrations on an ELISA plate in conditions which have been shown not to favour tau-tau association (\nFigure 9\n). After blocking, full length recombinant tau (\"t\") is plated in conditions which permit selective detection of tau-tau binding. Binding is detected by an appropriate antibody, which recognises an epitope located near the N-terminus of full-length tau. This antibody does not recognise \"a\".\n \n \nFigure 11\n: Determination of Kd for binding of full-length tau (\"T40\") to the truncated core tau unit terminating at Ala-390 (\"a\"), using \nmAb\n 499 to measure bound full-length human tau. The horizontal axis on the upper graph shows the concentration of T40 used and the vertical axis shows \nmAb\n 499 immunoreactivity. Each binding curve is obtained at a plating concentration of \"a\" which is shown. Without \"a\", there is no binding; confirming the absence of non-specific binding of T40 in the assay conditions used. Binding depends both on the concentration of T40 and the concentration of \"a\". The lower figure shows the calculated Kd corresponding to each plating concentration of \"a\". As the concentration of \"a\" becomes large, saturating conditions are approached assymptotically, and this represents the saturation Kd for binding of T40 to the truncated core tau unit, in this experiment determined as 22.8 nM.\n \n \nFigure 12\n: Using the standard assay format shown in \nFigure 10\n, with species \"a\" coated at 10 µg/ml and T40 added at the concentrations shown (range 0 - 50 µg/ml), binding was measured at constant pH (pH 7.4), while varying the sodium chloride concentration. A plateau is observed in the vicinity of the physiological salt concentration of 137 mM. Binding is reduced at moderately low and high salt concentrations, although binding becomes more favourable at very low salt concentration.\n \n \nFigure 13\n: Similar experiment to that shown in \nFigure 12\n, keeping the sodium chloride concentration constant at 137 mM, but varying the pH in the range 0 - 10, with binding in physiological phosphate-buffered normal saline (\"PBS\", pH 7.4) shown for comparison. Binding is reduced at extremes of pH. Binding shown detected by mAb' \n \ns\n \n 499 and 342.\n \n \nFigure 14\n: Typical sets of binding curves using the truncated core tau unit \"a\" in the solid phase, and incubating full length tau which has (\"T40P\") or has not (\"T40\") been phosphorylated in vitro using the method of \nBiernat et al. (1992) EMBO J. 11, 1593-1597\n). The Kd was reduced by phosphorylation in this experiment by 10-fold, although varying the state of phosphorylation in the aqueous and solid phases systematically, the overall effect of phosphorylation can be shown to be on average 20-fold inhibition of binding. Although a fetal state of phosphorylation has been proposed by some as important for determining pathological tau-tau binding, fetal rat tau (\"POTr\") when introduced in the aqueous phase is shown here to be incapable of pathological binding to the core tau unit.\n \n \nFigure 15\n: By contrast with \nFigure 14\n, after fetal tau has been bound passively in the solid phase, it is able to bind full-length unphosphorylated tau. A typical set of binding curves is shown in A, varying the concentration of full-length tau (\"T40\") and fetal tau (\"P0 Tau\") in the concentration ranges shown. The derived assymptotic Kd is shown in B. As with binding of the full-length tau to the truncated core tau unit, binding of full-length tau to immobilised fetal tau has the same Kd of - 20 nM. Thus fetal tau, which does not bind to tau when it is present in the aqueous phase (\nFigure 14\n), is converted into a tau-binding species simply by passive binding to the solid phase. Thus passive binding of tau to a solid matrix exposes the high affinity tau capture site.\n \n \nFigure 16\n: Comparison of Kd values in the tau-tau binding assay using the species shown in the aqueous or solid phases. Phosphorylation of full length recombinant tau used in the aqueous phase inhibits binding by a factor of 10-fold, and foetal/newborn tau from rat does not bind, as shown in \nFigure 14\n. When newborn tau is used in the solid phase, T40 binds with the same affinity as to the truncated core PHF unit. Phosphorylation of T40 in the aqueous phase produces 30-fold inhibition of binding. Hyperphosphorylation of newborn tau in the solid phase inhibits binding to a comparable extent, and hyperphosphorylation in both phases produces 50-fold inhibition of binding. Therefore, contrary to the phosphorylation hypothesis, phosphorylation inhibits the pathological self-aggregation of tau protein in all configurations of the present assay.\n \n \nFigure 17\n: Proteolytic digestion of aggregated full-length tau protein. (A) Full-length tau (20 µg/ml) was bound to dGA (20 µg/ml) in PBS, washed, and incubated for 5 min with Pronase in water at the concentrations indicated. Immunoreactivity was measured with mAb's 342 (▲), 499 (○) and 423 (●). (B) Full-length tau (10 µg/ml) which had self-aggregated in the solid phase in the absence of dGA was digested similarly, and immunoreacticity was measured with mAb's 342 (A) and 423 (●). In both cases, protease concentration-dependent loss of immunoreactivity with both mAb's 499 and/or 342 occurred with the acquisition of \nmAb\n 423 immunoreactivity. (C) The results from (A) are depicted schematically. Truncated dGA, initially coated on the hatched solid phase, binds full-length tau with high affinity through interaction via the repeat region. Both species lack the \nmAb\n 423 epitope prior to digestion. Proteolytic digestion of the complex (dotted lines) removes the N-terminal portion of the full-length tau molecule with loss of the \n \nmAb\n \n 499 and 342 epitopes located as shown. Acquisition of immunoreacticity with \nmAb\n 423 indicates truncation of full-length tau at Glu-391. The precise N-terminal extent of the proteolytically stable complex is unknown, but excludes the \nmAb\n 342 epitope immediately adjacent to the repeat region, and includes the tau-binding domain.\n \n \nFigure 18\n: Accumulation of truncated tau by repetitive tau capture. Beginning with the truncated tau fragment (dGA, 20µg/ml) in the solid phase, full-length recombinant human tau (20 µg/ml) was bound, digested with Pronase (1 ng/ml) for 5 min, washed, and the preparation was again incubated with further full-length tau (20 µg/ml) and again digested. This binding/digestion cycle was repeated four times; \nmAb\n 499 immunoreactivity was measured before and after, and \nmAb\n 423 measured only after, each Pronase digestion step. (A) Pronase digestion of the complex was associated with incremental accumulation of tau protein truncated at Glu-391 in the solid phase following each digestion cycle. (B) Binding of full-length tau was detected by the appearance of immunoreactivity for the N-terminus of tau (mAb 499), which was entirely abolished by Pronase digestion. In the subsequent incubation cycle, the binding capacity was increased for full-length tau incubated at a constant concentration in the aqueous phase. The \nincremental mAb\n 499 immunoreactivity cannot be explained by residual immunoreactivity left from the preceding cycle. Thus the proteolytically stable complex left after Pronase digestion retains the capacity to bind further tau, and this binding capacity increases as truncated tau accumulates in the solid phase.\n \n \nFigure 19\n: Relative tau-tau binding (vertical axis) in the presence of increasing concentrations of prototype inhibitory phenothiazines (horizontal axis). This inhibition can be expressed in terms of a standard competitive inhibition model, with calculated Ki of 98 - 108 nM. The correlation coefficients for these approximations are 0.99, and are highly significant statistically, as shown.\n \n \nFigure 20\n: Selective inhibition of tau-tau-binding by thionine. Truncated tau protein was used at 489 nM in both aqueous and solid phases of the assay as in \nFigure 8\n (filled circles). In the tau-tubulin assay, depolymerised tubulin was coated at 200 nM (open circles), and tau was incubated at 400 nM. Binding data could be described mathematically by a standard model which assumes competitive inhibition at the high affinity tau capture site. The Ki values were calculated using the K\nd\n values obtained from the corresponding binding studies using full-length tau. Data points represent means of quadruplicate measurements.\n \n \nFigure 21\n: Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of a human tau protein isoform (SEQ ID NO: 4). The sequence, deduced from cDNA clone htau40, differs from the previously determined three-repeat form (Goedert et al. (1988), loc. cit.) by an extra 58 amino acids inserted in the amino-terminal region (underlined) an by the previously described (\nGoedert et al. (1989), EMBO J. 8, 393-399\n) extra repeat of 31 amino acids (underlined). Nucleotides are numbered in the 5'-3' direction. The cDNA clone htau40 (\nGoedert et al. (1989b), \n) contains the above sequence inserted into an Nde1 site (5'-end) and an EcoR1 site 3' to the termination to the codon (***).\n \n \nFigure 22\n: Amino acid and cDNA sequence of PHF-core tau unit (SEQ ID NO: 6; Novak et al. (1993), loc. cit.), and primers (SEQ ID NO: 7 and 8) used in construction of the preferred core tau unit.\n \n \nFigure 23\n: Ranking of compounds by inhibition of tau-tau interaction. Ranking is based on the standardised binding relative to that seen in the absence of compound taken as the mean observed at 1 and 10 µg/ml. In this ranking, \"1\" represents binding equivalent to that observed in the absence of compound, whereas \"0.2\" indicates that binding was reduced to a mean of 20% at \n \ntest compound concentrations\n \n 1 and 10 µg/ml. Thus the lower the number the more effective the compound at inhibiting the binding of e and a. As can be seen, the first five phenothiazines have standardised binding coefficients less the 0.4. That is, the binding seen in the range 1 - 10 µg/ml is less than 40 % of that seen in the absence of compound.\n \n \nFigure 24\n: Chemical structures of the compounds tested with values for standardised binding according to \nFigure 17\n.\n \n \nFigure 25\n: Schematic representation of tau, MAP2 (adult form), MAP2C (juvenile form) and high molecular weight tau (found in the peripheral nervous system and neuroblastoma cell lines). These proteins share similar microtubule-binding domains, but differ substantially in sequence and extent of the N-terminal projection domain. The juvenile forms of tau and MAP2 have only 3 of the tandem repeats. A 4-repeat form of MAP2 also exists.\n \n \nFigure 26\n: Sequence differences in the tandem repeat region of human tau (upper line; SEQ ID NO: 9) and human MAP2 (lower line; SEQ ID NO: 10).

It has a neomycin resistance marker for Geneticin selection.\n \n \nFigure 28\n: Mouse fibroblast 3T3 cells transfected with PIF2::T40, expressing full-length human tau protein (T40), immunolabelled by mAb 7.51 (upper figure) and mAb 499 (lower figure).

Cells are grossly abnormal, multinucleate, vacuolated, containing aggregates of tau protein in the cytoplasm.\n \n \nFigure 30\n: Lipofectin/tau protein transfers into 3T3 cells transfected with PIF2::T40. Relative cell survival (normalised to cell counts after Lipofectin treatment without protein) is shown for approximately equimolar concentrations of full-length (T40, 220 nM) and truncated tau (dGAE, 300 nM), without (unshaded) or with shaded) thionine at 3.5 µM. Truncated tau is more toxic than full-length tau (p = 0.02), despite the fact that at equimolar concentrations, the total protein load is 5 x greater in the case of full-length tau.\n \n \nFigure 31\n: (A) Reversal of truncated tau toxicity: The toxicity of truncated tau transferred via lipofectin into 3T3 cells expressing full-length tau is concentration dependent. Thionine (full-line) significantly reversed toxicity seen in the absence of thionine (broken line) at all three concentrations of truncated tau. (B) Similar experiment in which full-length tau was transferred via lipofectin into 3T3 cells expressing full-length. Both toxicity and thionine effects were much less apparent.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe following Examples are intended to illustrate details of the invention, without thereby limiting it in any manner.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 1:\n Tau-tau-binding assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe assay is carried out in a 96-well PVC microtitre plate, with solutions added and readings taken with respect to individual wells:\n\n \n \n \na) A 50 µl solution of purified truncated tau peptide at varying concentrations ranging 0 - 50 µg/ml (0,1,5,10,50 µg/ml) in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) is added to each well and incubated 1 hr at 37°C.\n \nb) The microtitre plate wells are washed 3 x with water with or without 0.05% Tween.\n \nc) A 200 µl solution of 2% milk extract (\"Marvel\") made up in phosphate-buffered normal saline (\"PBS\", 137 mM sodium chloride, 1.47 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 8.1 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 2.68 mM potassium chloride) is added to each well and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C.\n \nd) The plate is washed as in b).\n \ne) A 50 µl solution of full-length recombinant tau (T40) in the same range of concentrations as in a) above in 1 % gelatine, 0.05% Tween in PBS is added to each well, and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C.\n \nf) The plate is washed as in b).\n \ng) A 50 µl solution of \nmonoclonal antibody\n 499 is added at 1/2 dilution of the tissue culture supernatant with 2% milk extract (\"Marvel\") in PBS is added to each well and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C.\n \nh) The plate is washed as in b).\n \ni) A 50 µl solution of second antibody (blotting grade affinity purified goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase - Biorad catalogue number 170-6516) at 1/1000 dilution in PBS with 0.05% Tween is added to each well and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C.\n \nj) The plate is washed 3x with a 0.05% solution of Tween in water, followed by a single wash with water.\n \nk) Preparation of colour development solution is as follows.

Add 10 ml sodium acetate stock (0.5 M, pH 5.0) to 90 ml of water. While swirling, slowly add 1 ml TMB solution, followed by 10 µl hydrogen peroxide.\n \nl) A 50 µl solution of TMB solution is added to each well to develop the peroxidase colour reaction, the rate of development of which is read over 2 min. at 650 nm, in a Molecular Devices Microplate reader using Kinetic L1 Softmax software package.\n \n\n\n \nExample 2:\n Preparation of recombinant tau fragments\n\n\n \n \n \nTau cDNA was generated using standard protocols (Sambrook et al., loc. cit.) from mRNA isolated from brain tissue of an Alzheimer patient whose tissue was obtained 3 h after death. The cDNA library was screened with synthetic 17-mer oligonucleotide probes derived from the sequence from part of a PHF core protein (Goedert et al. (1988), loc. cit.). Full length cDNA clones were subcloned into the EcoRI site of M13mp18 and site-directed mutagenesis used to introduce a NdeI site in the context of the initiator codon. Following cleavage with NdeI and EcoRI, the resulting cDNA fragments were subcloned downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promotor into NdeI/EcoRI -cut expression plasmid pRK172 (\nMcLeod et al. (1987) EMBO J., 6, 729-736\n). pRK172 is a derivative of pBR322 that is propagated at very high copy number in E. coli due to removal of the pBR322 copy number control region. The plasmid carries an ampicillin resistance gene for selection of recombinant clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConstructs coding for truncated forms of tau were prepared from mRNA as described in Novak et al. (1993, loc. cit.). The mRNA was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific oligonucleotide primers. The sense primer contained an NdeI site and the anti-sense, an EcoRI site. PCR fragments were subcloned into pRK172 as described above. The primers used for construction of dGAE are given in \nFigure 22\n. The authenticity of all DNA fragments used for expression was confirmed by full length sequencing of both strands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetails for the construction of htau40 (\"T40\") cDNA are described in (Goedert et al. (1989), loc. cit.). This sequence is the largest form of tau found in the CNS and encodes tau protein that contains both the 2 N-terminal inserts of 29 amino acids each and an extra 31 amino acid repeat in the tubulin-binding domain. The DNA sequence and its predicted amino acid sequence are shown in \nFigure 21\n (SEQ ID NO: 4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant plasmids were used to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3) a strain used for prokaryotic expression which carries a chromosomal copy of the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase gene under control of the lacUV5 promotor (\nStudier and Moffat (1986), J. Mol. Biol. 189, 113-130\n). Exponentially growing cultures were induced with IPTG (iso-propyl thiogalactoside) for 3h.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLarge-scale purification (1 litre bacterial culture) of tau fragments was carried out as described by \nGoedert and Jakes (1990, EMBO J., 9, 4225-4230\n), with minor modifications. Cells were disrupted by rapid freezing of the cell pellet in liquid nitrogen. The pellets were then suspended in buffer containing 50 mM PIPES, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (pH 6.8). The thermostable proteins in the supernatant were dialysed against PIPES/DTT, then applied to a column containing phosphocellulose equilibrated in the same buffer. Tau protein was eluted with a gradient of NaCl (0-0.5M) in the above buffer. Fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and both Coomassie staining and immunoblotting. Those fractions containing tau were pooled, dialysed against 25 mM MES, 1 mM DTT (pH 6.25) and stored at -20°C at approximately 5 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were measured by the Lowry method (Harrington (1990), loc. cit.).\n\n\n \n \nExample 3:\n Binding of foetal MAP2C to truncated and full length tau\n\n\n \n \n \nOne possible explanation for the lack of MAP2 in PHFs might be that MAP2 in PHFs might be MAP2 is unable to bind to the core tau unit of the PHF because of sequence differences in the repeat regions. This was examined experimentally using the standard binding assay in two configurations: truncated tau in the solid phase with foetal MAP2C in the aqueous phase, and MAP2C in the solid phase with full-length tau in the aqueous phase. Binding could be demonstrated in both configurations, ant thionine blocked the tau/MAP2 binding interaction. Thus, aggregation in the tandem-repeat region is not selective for tau, and the inhibitory activity of phenothiazine inhibitors such as thionine is not dependent on sequences unique to tau. The reason why MAP2 is not found in PHFs is at present unknown, but factors may include the contribution of the large N-terminal domain found in the adult form of MAP2, compartment differences within the cell, or other differences in processing of the MAP2 molecules.\n\n\n \n \nExample 4:\n Transfection of mouse 3T3 cells with human tau protein\n\n\n \n \n \nMouse fibroblast 3T3 cells were transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector (pIF2) containing full-length and truncated forms of tau protein under constitutive control by a β-globin promotor . This vector contains a neomycin resistance gene as a selectable marker (pSV2neo; Sambrook et al. (1989), loc. cit.; modified by M. N. Neuberger). Cells were cultured in defined minimal essential mixtures (DMEM) containing antimicrobial agents and 10% foetal calf serum at 37° C in an atmosphere of 5% CO\n2\n. They were transfected with plasmid DNA either using a standard calcium phosphate protocol or by lipofection (according to manufacturers protocol; Gibco BRL). Cells which had integrated the plasmid DNA were selected by viability in medium containing Geneticin (0.5 mg/ml; \nSouthern and Berg (1982), J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1, 327\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStably transfected 3T3 fibroblast expressing full-length tau protein were readily produced. Expression could be demonstrated histologically using generic (mAB 7.51) and human-specific (mAB 499) anti-tau antibodies (\nFigure 28\n), and by immunoblot of cell extracts (not shown). Two viable cell lines were produced when the transfection was carried out using the same vector carrying the truncated core tau unit. Truncated tau could be demonstrated within these cells histologically, but the morphology of these cells was grossly abnormal compared to those expressing full-length tau (\nFigure 29\n). Abnormalities included failure of process development, formation of large rounded cells, cytoplasmic aggregation of tau and vacuolation of the cytoplasm. However, these cells proved unstable, and readily reverted to forms failing to express truncated tau protein despite the continued presence of Geneticin. The toxicity of truncated tau might be explained either by the accumulation of toxic tau-tau aggregates in the cell or by the binding of truncated tau to endogenous mouse MAPs essential for the cell.\n\n\n \n \nExample 5:\n Growing of tau-transfected cells in the presence of phenothiazine inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nThe toxicity of the truncated core tau unit might be reversible in part if the prototype phenothiazine inhibitors could be used to block self-aggregation in vivo. This would be feasible only if the compounds were not intrinsically toxic at concentrations needed to block tau-tau binding. The inhibitors with the lowest toxicity in 3T3 cells were thionine and acriflavin, and cells could survive prolonged exposure to these compounds at concentrations substantially in excess of the Ki values (100 nM) for inhibition of tau-tau binding in vitro. In practice, 3T3 cells could be grown several month in the presence of 2µM thionine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe influence of thionine on the tau-tubulin binding interaction was examined in vivo by culturing 3T3 fibroblast transfected with full-length tau protein in the presence of thionine at a range of concentrations. Disruption of normal cytoskeletal distribution of tau immunoreactivity was seen at concentrations in the range 4 - 8µM, comparable with the known K\ni\n for inhibition of the tau-tubulin binding interaction in vitro (8 µM), but no effect was seen over the concentration range at which transfected 3T3 cells were routinely cultured (0.5 - 2 µM). These findings demonstrate the feasibility of culturing transfected cell lines in the presence of prototypic_inhibitor without detriment either to cell viability or to the normal cytoskeletal distribution of transgenic full-length tau protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGrowing transfected cells in the presence of inhibitors of tau-tau binding was found to increase the viability of cells transfected with truncated tau in a dose-dependent manner. The number of viable cell lines transfected with truncated tau increased when the cells were grown in the presence of higher concentrations of thionine. Furthermore, the strength of expression of truncated tau, measured by immunohistochemistry on a semiquantitative scale, was found to increase as a function of the thionine concentration used following transfection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe morphology of 3T3 cells and the distribution of truncated tau protein were much less abnormal when transfected cell lines were produced in the presence of thionine. Truncated tau protein appeared to follow the distribution of the endogenous microtubule network, but the tau staining had a more broken character than seen with full length tau. Cells expressing high levels of truncated tau were found to form aggregates with gross disruption of the cell cytoplasm when thionine was removed. This was similar to the initial findings for cells transfected in the absence of thionine.\n\n\n \n \nExample 6:\n Untransfected neuronal cell lines\n\n\n \n \n \nNeuronal cell lines (N2A, NIE-115) were cultured in DMEM containing 2% or 10% foetal calf serum and 5% horse serum on tissue culture plates coated with collagen. These were all grown at 37° C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO\n2\n. Initial immunohistochemical studies of neuronal cell lines prior to transfection led to the identification of cytoplasmic aggregates immunoreactive with \nmAb\n 423 forming in the cytoplasm of undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells (N2A cells) and in PC-12 cells after brief treatment with dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP, known to differentiate neuroblastoma cells in tissue culture). These structures were shown to be immunoreactive with an antibody recognising neurofilament protein (NFH; SMI-31, \nSternberger et al. (1985) PNAS 82, 4274-4276\n) and more sparesly immunoreactive with an antibody recognising MAP1A, which is known to bind neurofilaments. In the course of differentiation, this \nendogenous mAb\n 423 immunoreactivity was seen to shift from the cytoplasm to neurites. Immuno-precipitation of mAb423 immunoreactivity from these cells led to the identification of a species with gel mobility of 230 kDa which was recognised by SMI-31. These results suggest that the structures recognised by \nmAb\n 423 in rodent neuronal cell lines include the high molecular weight neurofilament protein in an aggregated state, but do not exclude the possibility that they also include altered MAPs. We refer to them as presumptive-NFH aggregates (pNFH). Dose-dependent inhibition of pNFH aggregates in the cytoplasm could be demonstrated with thionine in untransfected PC-12 cells.\n\n\n \n \nExample 7:\n Transfection of neuronal cell lines with full-length and truncated tau proteins and effects of tau aggregation inhibitors\n\n\nA. PC-12 cells\n\n\n \n \n \nPC-12 cells were transfected with the pIF2 vector containing either the PHF-core tau fragment truncated at Glu-391 or full-length tau protein. As with 3T3 fibroblasts, no viable cell lines transfected with truncated tau were produced unless cells were grown in thionine following transfection. Once stabilised, transfected cell lines were analysed in the presence or absence of db-cAMP and in the presence and absence of thionine. Two endpoints were examined: formation of cytoplasmic pNFH aggregates, and distribution of pNFH immunoreactivity into neurites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBrief incubation with db-cAMP increased the proportion of cells containing neurofilament aggregates from 9% to 37% (p < 0.001). This effect was seen both in cells transfected with truncated tau (10% vs 47%, p < 0.001), and the differential effect of truncated tau was itself significant (p = 0.005). Thus, transfection with truncated tau accentuated the formation of pNFH aggregates in response to db-cAMP. -\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect of withdrawal of thionine after db-cAMP treatment was to double the frequency of cells with pNFH aggregates (27% vs 49%, p = 0.05). These increases were seen for cells transfected with both full-length tau (16% vs 32%) and truncated tau (36% vs 60%). A further effect was thionine-dependent incorporation of pNFH immunoreactivity into neurites. This was particularly evident in PC-12 cells transfected with truncated, but not full-length tau or untransfected cells (pNFH-neurite indices 0.49 vs 0.04 with and without thionine respectively, p = 0.07).\n\n\n \nB. NIE-115 cells\n\n\n \n \n \nIn general, pNFH aggregates seen in the cytoplasm of N2A cells did not occur in untransfected NIE cells. Rather, pNFH immunoreactivity was normally incorporated into growing neurites during the course of differentiation, although an early perinuclear-arc stage was also seen. NIE cells were transfected as above with the pIF2 vector containing either full-length or truncated tau protein and grown in the presence of thionine. The effects of adding db-cAMP in the presence or absence of thionine were then examined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs with PC-12 cells, no stable NIE cells transfected with truncated tau were produced in the absence of thionine. Those transfected with truncated tau produced a significantly higher overall frequency of pNFH aggregates in the cytoplasm than cells transfected with full-length tau (9% vs 26%, p <0.001), and incubation with db-cAMP induced pNFH aggregates in cells transfected with truncated tau but not in full-length tau transfectants (6% vs 36%, p < 0.001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn cells transfected with full-length tau, the presence of thionine did not interfere with the incorporation of transgenic tau protein into the microtubular cytoskeleton, including the microtubule organising centre, diffuse cytoplasmic distribution and extension into neurites. Withdrawal of thionine in cells transfected with full-length tau increased the proportion containing pNFH aggregates (7% vs 16%, p = 0.03). In cells transfected with truncated tau thionine withdrawal resulted in increased pNFH aggregates in specific cell lines (e.g. NIE-ND6, 14 % vs 44%, p = 0.07), which were also characterised by suppression of differentiation. This revision to a phenotype previously seen only in undifferentiated N2A cells, but not in NIE cells was striking.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs with PC-12 cells, thionine-dependent incorporation of pNFH into neurites could be demonstrated after db-cAMP treatment in certain cells (e.g. NIE-ND1, pNFH-neurite indices 0.1 vs 0.66 with and without thionine respectively, p = 0.01). Thionine-dependent transport of pNFH into neurites could be seen quantitatively as a reversal of the relationship between cytoplasmic and neuritic neurofilament NHF immunoreactivity in transfected cell in the presence of thionine ( r = -0.52 vs r = +0.52 without and with thionine; p = 0.01 and 0.02 respectively).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSEQUENCE LISTING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n(1) GENERAL INFORMATION:\n\n \n(i) APPLICANT:\n\n \n(A) NAME: HOFFMANN-LA ROCHE AG\n \n(B) STREET: Grenzacherstrasse 124\n \n(C) CITY: Basle\n \n(D) STATE: BS -\n \n(E) COUNTRY: Switzerland\n \n(F) POSTAL CODE (ZIP): CH-4070\n \n(G) TELEPHONE: 061-688 51 08\n \n(H) TELEFAX: 061-688 13 95\n \n(I) TELEX: 962292/965542 hlr ch\n \n \n \n(ii) TITLE OF INVENTION: INHIBITION OF TAU-TAU-ASSOCIATION\n \n(iii) NUMBER OF SEQUENCES: 12\n \n(iv) COMPUTER READABLE FORM:\n\n \n(A) MEDIUM TYPE: Floppy disk\n \n(B) COMPUTER: IBM PC compatible\n \n(C) OPERATING SYSTEM: PC-DOS/MS-DOS\n \n(D) SOFTWARE: PatentIn Release #1.0, Version #1.30 (EPO)\n \n \n \n \n\n\n(2) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO: 1:\n\n \n(i) SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n \n(A) LENGTH: 109 amino acids\n \n(B) TYPE: amino acid\n \n(C) STRANDEDNESS:\n \n(D) TOPOLOGY: linear\n \n \n \n(ii) MOLECULE TYPE: peptide\n \n(xi) SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION: SEQ ID NO: 1:\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n(2) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO: 2:\n\n \n(i) SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n \n(A) LENGTH: 108 amino acids\n \n(B) TYPE: amino acid\n \n(C) STRANDEDNESS: -\n \n(D) TOPOLOGY: linear\n \n \n \n(ii) MOLECULE TYPE: peptide\n \n(xi) SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION: SEQ ID NO: 2:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n(2) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO: 3:\n\n \n(i) SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n \n(A) LENGTH: 109 amino acids\n \n(B) TYPE: amino acid\n \n(C) STRANDEDNESS:\n \n(D) TOPOLOGY: linear\n \n \n \n(ii) MOLECULE TYPE: peptide\n \n(xi) SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION: SEQ ID NO: 3:\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n(2) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO: 4:\n\n \n(i) SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n \n(A) LENGTH: 1326 base pairs\n \n(B) TYPE: nucleic acid\n \n(C) STRANDEDNESS: single\n \n(D) TOPOLOGY: linear\n \n \n \n(ii) MOLECULE TYPE: cDNA\n \n(ix) FEATURE:\n\n \n(A) NAME/KEY: CDS\n \n(B) LOCATION:1..1326\n \n \n \n(xi) SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION: SEQ ID NO: 4:\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n(2) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO: 5:\n\n \n(i) SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n \n(A) LENGTH: 442 amino acids\n \n(B) TYPE: amino acid\n \n(D) TOPOLOGY: linear\n \n \n \n(ii) MOLECULE TYPE: protein\n \n(xi) SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION: SEQ ID NO: 5:\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n(2) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO: 6:\n\n \n(i) SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n \n(A) LENGTH: 291 base pairs\n \n(B) TYPE: nucleic acid\n \n(C) STRANDEDNESS: single\n \n(D) TOPOLOGY: linear\n \n \n \n(ii) MOLECULE TYPE: peptide\n \n(xi) SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION: SEQ ID NO: 6:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n(2) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO: 7:\n\n \n(i) SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n \n(A) LENGTH: 48 base pairs\n \n(B) TYPE: nucleic acid\n \n(C) STRANDEDNESS: single\n \n(D) TOPOLOGY: linear\n \n \n \n(ii) MOLECULE TYPE: cDNA\n \n(xi) SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION: SEQ ID NO: 7:\n\nGCCCGGGCCC CATAGATCAA ACACGTCCCG GGAGGCGGCA GTGTGCAA    48\n \n \n\n\n(2) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO: 8:\n\n \n(i) SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n \n(A) LENGTH: 47 base pairs\n \n(B) TYPE: nucleic acid\n \n(C) STRANDEDNESS: single\n \n(D) TOPOLOGY: linear\n \n \n \n(ii) MOLECULE TYPE: cDNA\n \n(xi) SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION: SEQ ID NO: 8:\n\nAGATTACAGA ATTCTCACTC CGCCCCGTGG TCTGTCTTGG CTTTGGC    47\n \n \n\n\n(2) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO: 9:\n\n \n(i) SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n \n(A) LENGTH: 140 amino acids\n \n(B) TYPE: amino acid\n \n(C) STRANDEDNESS:\n \n(D) TOPOLOGY: linear\n \n \n \n(ii) MOLECULE TYPE: peptide\n \n(xi) SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION: SEQ ID NO: 9:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n(2) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO: 10:\n\n \n(i) SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n \n(A) LENGTH: 140 amino acids\n \n(B) TYPE: amino acid\n \n(C) STRANDEDNESS:\n \n(D) TOPOLOGY: linear\n \n \n \n(ii) MOLECULE TYPE: peptide\n \n(xi) SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION: SEQ ID NO: 10:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n(2) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO: 11:\n\n \n(i) SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n \n(A) LENGTH: 34 base pairs\n \n(B) TYPE: nucleic acid\n \n(C) STRANDEDNESS: single\n \n(D) TOPOLOGY: linear\n \n \n \n(ii) MOLECULE TYPE: cDNA\n \n(xi) SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION: SEQ ID NO: 11:\n\nCGCGACGCGT ATGATCAAAC ACGTCCCGGG AGGC    34\n \n \n\n\n(2) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO: 12:\n\n \n(i) SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n \n(A) LENGTH: 37 base pairs\n \n(B) TYPE: nucleic acid\n \n(C) STRANDEDNESS: single\n \n(D) TOPOLOGY: linear\n \n \n \n(ii) MOLECULE TYPE: cDNA\n \n(xi) SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION: SEQ ID NO: 12:\n\nCGGCTTTGTC TGGTGCCCCG CCTCACTCCT AGGGCGC    37"

Furthermore, the present invention relates to nucleic acid molecules coding for these variants, to the host cells comprising nucleic acid molecules and to methods for producing polypeptide variants and recombinant polypeptide variants. Furthermore, the present invention relates to the use of polypeptide variants for the stimulation of chondrogenesis, osteogenesis and wound healing or for the treatment of inflammation and cancer.

Viele dieser Faktoren sind bis heute unbekannt, die von ihnen gesteuerten Prozesse sind noch nicht vollständig verstanden. Auch die Knochenbildung (Osteogenese) ist ein bisher unvollständig verstandener Prozeß; ihr Ablauf ist durch zahlreiche aufeinander folgende Einzelprozesse, wie z. B. Chemotaxis, Mitose und Differenzierung, gekennzeichnet. Chemotaxis bedeutet in diesem Zusammenhang die direkte Einwanderung von Zellen als Antwort auf einen chemischen Gradienten von Signalverbindungen, die aus der unlöslichen demineralisierten Knochenmatrix, die hauptsächlich aus Typ I unlöslichem Collagen besteht, freigesetzt werden. An dieses Typ I unlösliche Collagen bindet Plasma-Fibronektin, welches seinerseits Domänen zur Bindung von Collagen, Fibrin und Heparin aufweist.\nNumerous biological factors influence the development and regeneration of cells, tissues and organs of the human and animal body. Many of these factors are still unknown and the processes they control are not fully understood. Bone formation (osteogenesis) is an incompletely understood process. Their sequence is characterized by numerous successive individual processes, such. Chemotaxis, mitosis and differentiation. Chemotaxis in this context means the direct migration of cells in response to a chemical gradient of signaling compounds released from the insoluble demineralized bone matrix consisting primarily of Type I insoluble collagen. Collagen which is insoluble in this type I binds plasma fibronectin, which in turn has domains for binding collagen, fibrin and heparin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAn der Steuerung der Osteogenese sind prinzipiell zwei Hauptgruppen von biologisch aktiven Faktoren, die systemisch bzw. die lokal wirkenden Faktoren, beteiligt.\nIn principle, two main groups of biologically active factors, the systemic or the locally acting factors, are involved in the control of osteogenesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nZur Gruppe der systemisch wirkenden Faktoren gehören beispielsweise die beiden Hormone Parathormon (PTH) und 1,25-Dihydroxy-Vitamin D, die den endogenen Calcium-Spiegel regulieren. Ein weiteres an der Knochenentwicklung beteiligtes Hormon ist Calcitonin, das die Knochenresorption verhindert.\nThe group of systemic factors includes, for example, the two hormones parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, which regulate endogenous calcium levels. Another hormone involved in bone development is calcitonin, which prevents bone resorption. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nZu den die Osteogenese regulierenden systemischen Hormone gehören außerdem beispielsweise Östrogene, Androgene, Wachstumshormone, Insulin-like growth factor (IGF), Schilddrüsenhormone und Glucocorticoide.\nThe systemic hormones regulating osteogenesis also include, for example, estrogens, androgens, growth hormones, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), thyroid hormones and glucocorticoids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nZur Gruppe der lokal wirkenden Faktoren gehören\n\n \n(i) Cytokine, die den Knochenabbau bewirken, wie IL-1, Tumornekrose-Faktor (TNF), IL-6, IL-11 und ODF (Osteoklastendifferenzierungsfaktor, TRANCE);\n \n(ii) Cytokine, die den Knochenabbau verhindern: IL-4, IL-13, IL-18, IFN (Interferon), OPG (Osteoprotegerin) und IL-1ra (Interleukin-1-Rezeptor-Antagonist);\n \n(iii) Kolonie-stimulierende Faktoren: M-CSF (Makrophagen-Kolonie stimulierender Faktor) und GM-CSF (Granulozyten-Makrophagen stimulierender Faktor);\n \n(iv) Prostaglandine, Leukotriene und Stickstoffmonoxid; und\n \n(v) Wachstumsfaktoren: IGF (Insulin-like growth factor; Insulin-artiger Wachstumsfaktor), Proteine aus der DVR (Decapentaplegic-Vg-related)-Familie einschließlich der Proteine der TGF-β (transforming growth factor β; transformierender Wachstumsfaktor β)-Superfamilie, die die Proteine aus der Activin/Inhibin-Familie, MIS (Mullerian Inhibitory Substance; Müllerscher Inhibitor), GDF (growth/differentiation factor; Wachstums/Differenzierungsfaktor), Nodal und Dorsalin umfaßt; FGF (fibroblast growth factor; Fibroblastenwachstumsfaktor), PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor; Blutplättchen-abstammender Wachstumsfaktor) und PTHrP (PTH-related protein; Parathormon-verwandtes Protein).\n \n Belong to the group of locally acting factors \n \n (i) cytokines that cause bone degradation, such as IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, IL-11, and ODF (osteoclast differentiation factor, TRANCE); \n \n (ii) cytokines that prevent bone loss: IL-4, IL-13, IL-18, IFN (interferon), OPG (osteoprotegerin), and IL-1ra (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist); \n \n (iii) colony stimulating factors: M-CSF (macrophage colony stimulating factor) and GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage stimulating factor); \n \n (iv) prostaglandins, leukotrienes and nitric oxide; and \n \n (v) growth factors: insulin-like growth factor (IGF), proteins from the DVR (decapentaplegic-Vg-related) family including the TGF-β (transforming growth factor) proteins; A superfamily comprising activin / inhibin family proteins, MIS (Mullerian Inhibitory Substance), growth / differentiation factor (GDF), nodal, and dorsal proteins; FGF (fibroblast growth factor), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PTHrP (PTH-related protein). \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIm Zusammenhang mit der vorliegenden Erfindung ist die TGF-β Superfamilie von besonderem Interesse.\nIn the context of the present invention, the TGF-β superfamily is of particular interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie TGF-β Superfamilie umfaßt derzeit mehr als 20 Proteine, wobei die vermuteten Orthologen in verschiedenen Organismen nicht mitgerechnet sind. Neben den TGF-β 's gehören die BMP's (bone morphogenetic proteins), die GDF's (growth differentiation factors) Inhibine/Aktivine und weitere Proteine (Kingsley, 1994) zur Superfamilie. Sie bestehen alle aus zwei Untereinheiten, die fast immer Homodimere aus zwei identischen Monomeren sind und kovalent durch eine Disulfidbrücke verknüpft vorliegen. Kennzeichnendes Merkmal aller bis jetzt strukturell untersuchten Proteine der TGF-β Superfamilie ist das \"TGF-β/BMP Gerüst\", das aus einem Cystinknoten, einer α-Helix und mindestens vier β-Strängen pro Monomer besteht, und das im Dimer zu einer charakteristischen Anordnung der Monomeren führt (McDonald und Hendrickson, 1993). Die Aminosäuresequenzen können dabei sehr unterschiedlich sein und weisen zum Teil weniger als 40 % identisch besetzte Positionen auf. Besonders variabel sind die \"Loop\"-Bereiche sowie die N-terminalen Sequenzen. Andererseits ist für alle Faktoren der TGF-β Superfamilie eine erstaunliche Konservierung von Funktion und Struktur in der Stammesgeschichte gezeigt worden. So weisen sie alle ein als \"Cystinknoten\" bezeichnetes Strukturelement auf, das aus 3 in allen Proteinen der TGF-β Superfamilie konservierten und gleich angeordneten Disulfidbrücken besteht. Besonders gut untersucht sind neben den TGF-β's einzelne Vertreter der BMP's, wie BMP-2 und -7, und Vertreter der GDF's, wie GDF-5, die die Entwicklung und Regenerierung von Knochen und Knorpelgewebe in Gang setzen können. So ist z. B. für BMP-2 gezeigt worden, daß dieses sowohl in heterotopen als auch in orthotopen Implantatlagern osteoinduktive Eigenschaften aufweist.\nThe TGF-β superfamily currently comprises more than 20 proteins, with the suspected orthologues not being included in different organisms. In addition to TGF-β's, BMP's (bone morphogenetic proteins), GDF's (growth differentiation factors) inhibins / activins and other proteins (Kingsley, 1994) belong to the superfamily. They all consist of two subunits that are almost always homodimers of two identical monomers and covalently linked by a disulfide bridge.  Characteristic feature of all proteins of the TGF-β superfamily investigated so far is the \"TGF-β / BMP scaffold\", which consists of a cystine knot, an α-helix and at least four β-strands per monomer, and that in the dimer to a characteristic Arrangement of monomers leads (McDonald and Hendrickson, 1993). The amino acid sequences can be very different and sometimes have less than 40% identically occupied positions. Particularly variable are the \"loop\" regions and the N-terminal sequences. On the other hand, for all factors of the TGF-β superfamily, an astonishing conservation of function and structure has been shown in the phylogenetic history. Thus, they all have a structural element called \"cystine knot\" which consists of 3 disulfide bridges conserved in all proteins of the TGF-β superfamily and arranged identically. In addition to the TGF-β's, particular members of the BMPs, such as BMP-2 and -7, and GDF's, such as GDF-5, which can initiate the development and regeneration of bone and cartilage, have been particularly well studied. So z. For example, BMP-2 has been shown to exhibit osteoinductive properties in both heterotopic and orthotopic implant sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie Proteine der TGF-β Superfamilie werden in der Zelle zuerst als großes Proprotein synthetisiert, aus dem dann das reife Protein durch Proteolyse entsteht. Das Proprotein scheint nach einer ArgXXArg Erkennungssequenz gespalten zu werden, so daß eine C-terminale Sequenz von etwa 100 bis 140 Aminosäureresten, die das reife Protein darstellt, freigesetzt wird.\nThe proteins of the TGF-β superfamily are first synthesized in the cell as a large proprotein, from which the mature protein is then produced by proteolysis. The proprotein appears to be cleaved for an ArgXXArg recognition sequence, thus releasing a C-terminal sequence of about 100 to 140 amino acid residues, which is the mature protein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nZur Signaltransduktion binden die Faktoren der TGF-β Superfamilie an die extrazellulären Domänen von 2 Typen membranständiger Rezeptoren ihrer Zielzellen, z. B. induzierbarer Knochenmarksstammzellen. Die Typ 2 Untereinheit enthält im cytoplasmatischen Teil eine Protein-Serinkinase, die nach Ligandenbindung in der Typ 1 Untereinheit Serinreste phosphoryliert. Dadurch wird in der Typ 1 Untereinheit ebenfalls eine Protein-Serinkinase aktiviert, die intrazelluläre Signalproteine wie SMAD's phosphorylieren und aktivieren kann. Es gibt Hinweise, daß sowohl die Typ 1 als auch die Typ 2 Untereinheiten als Dimere existieren. Kürzlich ist die Kristallstruktur der extrazellulären Domäne des Typ 2 Untereinheit des Aktivinrezeptors (Act-RII) aufgeklärt wurden. BMP-2, das zu den besten untersuchten Proteinen der TGF-β Familie gehört, bindet an die Rezeptoruntereinheiten über die strukturell hoch konservierte Domäne nach dem ersten Cystein des Cystinknotens. Die supervariable N-terminale Sequenz vor dem ersten Cystein des Cystinknotens interagiert im BMP-2 nicht direkt mit den Rezeptoruntereinheiten. Die Interaktion von Proteinen der TGF-β Superfamilie mit Typ 1 und Typ 2 Rezeptor Untereinheiten ist zum Teil promiskuitiv und die Spezifitäten überlappen. Es ist noch nicht völlig geklärt, wieweit diese gemeinsame Nutzung von Rezeptor-Untereinheiten oder die Unterschiede im Mechanismus der Rezeptoraktivierung gehen. Aus der gegenwärtigen Literatur geht insbesondere nicht eindeutig hervor, welche Strukturelemente die Spezifität eines Proteins für z.B. eine osteoinduktive Aktivität ausmachen.\nFor signal transduction, the factors of the TGF-β superfamily bind to the extracellular domains of 2 types of membrane-bound receptors of their target cells, e.g. Inducible bone marrow stem cells. The \ntype\n 2 subunit contains in the cytoplasmic part a protein serine kinase which, after ligand binding in the \ntype\n 1 subunit, phosphorylates serine residues. This also activates a protein serine kinase in the \ntype\n 1 subunit, which can phosphorylate and activate intracellular signaling proteins such as SMADs. There is evidence that both \ntype\n 1 and \ntype\n 2 subunits exist as dimers. Recently, the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of the \ntype\n 2 subunit of the activin receptor (Act-RII) has been elucidated. BMP-2, which belongs to the best studied proteins of the TGF-β family, binds to the  Receptor subunits across the structurally highly conserved domain after the first cysteine of the cystin knot. The supervariable N-terminal sequence in front of the first cysteine of the cystine node does not interact directly with the receptor subunits in BMP-2. The interaction of proteins of the TGF-β superfamily with \ntype\n 1 and \ntype\n 2 receptor subunits is partly promiscuous and the specificities overlap. It is not fully understood to what extent this sharing of receptor subunits or the differences in the mechanism of receptor activation go. In particular, it is not clear from the current literature which structural elements make up the specificity of a protein for, for example, an osteoinductive activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAußer mit den Rezeptoruntereinheiten können die Faktoren der TGF-β Superfamilie mit einer Reihe weiterer Proteine interagieren. Dadurch kann die Aktivität der Faktoren moduliert oder gehemmt werden. Fetuin/α2-HS Glykoprotein und ein daraus abgeleitetes Peptid (TRH1) bindet BMP-2 und TGF-β, wobei BMP-2 mit höherer Affinität gebunden wird. Die Bindung kompetiert mit der Bindung an den Rezeptor. Das Noggin-Protein aus Säugetieren bindet BMP-2 mit hoher Affinität in Konkurrenz mit dem Rezeptor. Chordin wirkt, wie in Krallenfrosch-Oozyten gezeigt worden ist, als Hemmstoff für BMP-4. Follistatin bindet mit hoher Affinität an Aktivin und BMP-7. Für BMP-2 ist die Fähigkeit, an Heparin zu binden, nachgewiesen worden.\nIn addition to the receptor subunits, the factors of the TGF-β superfamily can interact with a number of other proteins. This may modulate or inhibit the activity of the factors. Fetuin / α2-HS glycoprotein and a peptide derived therefrom (TRH1) binds BMP-2 and TGF-β, binding BMP-2 with higher affinity. The binding competes with the binding to the receptor. The mammalian noggin protein binds BMP-2 with high affinity in competition with the receptor. Chordin acts as an inhibitor of BMP-4, as shown in clawed frog oocytes. Follistatin binds with high affinity to activin and BMP-7. For BMP-2, the ability to bind to heparin has been demonstrated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDas therapeutische Potential der Mitglieder der TGF-β Superfamilie ist aufgrund ihrer physiologischen Bedeutung offensichtlich. Hierbei sind insbesondere rekombinant hergestellte Proteine von Interesse, da sie in großer Menge erhalten werden können. Darüber hinaus sind die für sie kodierenden Nukleinsäuren potentielle Gen-Therapeutika.\nThe therapeutic potential of members of the TGF-β superfamily is evident because of their physiological significance. Recombinantly produced proteins are of particular interest since they can be obtained in large quantities. In addition, the nucleic acids encoding them are potential gene therapeutics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSomit besteht ein generelles Interesse an Mitgliedern der TGF-β Superfamilie und Varianten mit veränderten biologischen Eigenschaften. Kübler et al. (1999) beschreiben ein BMP-Analogon EHBMP-2, dessen Primärstruktur von der des natürlicherweise vorkommenden humanen BMP-2 dadurch abweicht, daß die mutmaßlich für die starke Heparin-Bindung von BMP-2 verantwortlichen ersten 12 Aminosäuren durch die ersten 13 Aminosäuren von humanem Interleukin-2 ersetzt sind. Das genetisch veränderte BMP-2-Analogon wurde rekombinant in \nE. coli\n exprimiert. EHBMP-2 weist eine vernachlässigbare Affinität zu Heparin und eine höhere biologische Aktivität in verschiedenen Zellkulturen, d.h. \nin vitro,\n auf. Beim Vergleich der \nin vivo\n-Aktivität der Variante mit natürlichem BMP-2 zeigte sich jedoch, daß in der Maus durch BMP-2-Konzentrationen ab 4 µg in annähernd allen Proben eine heterotope Knocheninduktion erzeugt wurde, wohingegen zur Erzielung desselben Effekts eine Menge von ca. 40 µg EHBMP-2 benötigt wurde. Weiterhin wurde beobachtet, daß das resultierende Ausmaß der Knochenneubildung bei gleichen Proteinkonzentrationen mit dem natürlichen BMP-2 signifikant größer war als bei seinem BMP-Analogon EHBMP-2. Ruppert et al (1996) beschreibt eine Heparin-Bindungsstelle im N-terminalen Bereich von hBMP-2. Ferner wird eine hBMP-2-Variante beschrieben, die keine Bindung an Heparin, jedoch eine erhöhte spezifische Aktivität aufweist.\nThus, there is a general interest in members of the TGF-β superfamily and variants with altered biological properties. Kübler et al. (1999) describe a BMP analogue EHBMP-2 whose primary structure differs from that of the naturally occurring human BMP-2 in that the first 12 amino acids presumed responsible for the strong heparin binding of BMP-2 are represented by the first 13 amino acids of human Interleukin-2 are replaced. The genetically modified BMP-2 analog was expressed recombinantly in \nE. coli\n . EHBMP-2 has a negligible  Affinity to heparin and a higher biological activity in different cell cultures, ie \nin vitro,\n on. When comparing the \nin vivo\n activity of the variant with natural BMP-2, however, it was found that heterotopic bone induction was produced in the mouse by BMP-2 concentrations from 4 μg in almost all samples, whereas to achieve the same effect a quantity of approx 40 μg EHBMP-2 was needed. Furthermore, it was observed that the resulting extent of new bone formation was significantly greater at the same protein concentrations with the native BMP-2 than with its BMP analog EHBMP-2. Ruppert et al (1996) describes a heparin-binding site in the N-terminal region of hBMP-2. Furthermore, a hBMP-2 variant is described which has no binding to heparin, but an increased specific activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie der vorliegenden Erfindung zugrunde liegende Aufgabe besteht somit darin, weitere Polpeptidvarianten bereitzustellen, deren \nin vivo\n Wirksamkeit derjenigen des Wildtyps entspricht oder erhöht ist. Eine weitere Aufgabe liegt in der Bereitstellung von für die Polpeptidvarianten kodierenden Nukleinsäuren und Vektoren und Wirtszellen, die diese Nukleinsäuren enthalten. Weiterhin sollen Verfahren zum Herstellen der Polypeptidvarianten bereitgestellt werden. Schließlich sollen pharmazeutische Zusammensetzungen, die diese Polypeptidvarianten enthalten, und deren Verwendung bereitgestellt werden.\nThe object underlying the present invention is thus to provide further Polpeptidvarianten whose \nin vivo\n efficacy of that of the wild type corresponds to or is increased. A further object is the provision of nucleic acids coding for the polypeptide variants and vectors and host cells which contain these nucleic acids. Furthermore, methods for producing the polypeptide variants are to be provided. Finally, pharmaceutical compositions containing these polypeptide variants and their use are to be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDiese Aufgabe wird erfindungsgemäß gelöst durch eine Polypeptidvariante mit erhöhter Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit, die dadurch gekennzeichnet ist, dass die Polypeptidvariante eine erhöhte Heparinbindungsfähigkeit aufweist, wobei an die Aminosäuresequenz des Polypeptids, ausgewählt aus Mitgliedern der TGFβ-Superfamilie, wenigstens ein Oligopeptids, ausgewählt aus Mitgliedern der TGFβ-Superfamilie, wenigstens ein Oligopeptid addiert und/oder inseriert ist und/oder wenigstens eine natürlicherweise in der Aminosäuresequenz des Polypeptids vorkommende Oligopeptidsequenz durch ein Oligopeptid substituiert ist, wobei das Oligopeptid die Aminosäuresequenz RKRA (SEQ ID NO: 3) oder RKRAKHKQ (SEQ ID NO: 4) umfasst.\nThis object is achieved according to the invention by a polypeptide variant with increased heparin-binding capacity, which is characterized in that the polypeptide variant has an increased heparin-binding capacity, wherein the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide selected from members of the TGFβ superfamily, at least one oligopeptide selected from members of the TGFβ superfamily, at least one oligopeptide is added and / or inserted and / or at least one oligopeptide sequence occurring naturally in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide is substituted by an oligopeptide, wherein the oligopeptide has the amino acid sequence RKRA (SEQ ID NO: 3) or RKRAKHKQ (SEQ ID NO: 4). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFerner ist hierin eine Polypeptidvariante beschrieben mit erhöhte Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit die dadurch gekennzeichnet ist, dass\n\n \n(i) an die Aminosäuresequenz eines Polypeptides mit geringer Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit wenigstens ein Oligopeptid, umfassend die Aminosäuresequenz X\n1\n X\n2\n X\n3\n X\n4\n X\n5\n X\n6\n, addiert ist und/oder,\n \n(ii) in die Aminosäuresequenz eines Polypeptides wenigstens ein Oligopeptid, umfassend die Aminosäuresequenz X\n1\nX\n2\nX\n3\nX\n4\nX\n5\nX\n6\n, inseriert ist und/oder\n \n(iii) wenigstens eine natürlicherweise in der Aminosäuresequenz eines Polypeptids vorkommende Oligopeptidsequenz durch ein Oligopeptid, umfassend eine Aminosäuresequenz X\n1\nX2X\n3\nX\n4\nX\n5\nX\n6\n, substituiert ist,\n \n\nwobei\n\nX\n1\n = K, R oder H;\n\nX\n2\n = K, R oder H;\n\nX\n3\n = K, R, H oder keine Aminosäure;\n\nX\n4\n = kein K, R, H, sonst beliebige Aminosäure;\n\nX\n5\n = kein K, R, H, sonst beliebige oder keine Aminosäure;\n\nX\n6\n = kein K, R, H, sonst beliebige oder keine Aminosäure, bedeutet (SEQ ID No: 1)\n\noder\n\nX\n1\n = K, R oder H;\n\nX\n2\n = kein K, R, H, sonst beliebige Aminosäure;\n\nX\n3\n = K, R oder H;\n\nX\n4\n = kein K, R, H, sonst beliebige Aminosäure;\n\nX\n5\n = kein K, R, H, sonst beliebige oder keine Aminosäure;\n\nX\n6\n = kein K, R, H, sonst beliebige oder keine Aminosäure (SEQ ID No: 2),\n\nbedeutet.Further described herein is a polypeptide variant having enhanced heparin-binding ability characterized in that \n \n (i) adding to the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide with low heparin binding capacity at least one oligopeptide comprising the amino acid sequence X \n1\n X \n2\n X \n3\n X \n4\n X \n5\n X \n6\n , and / or \n \n (Ii) in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide at least one oligopeptide comprising the amino acid sequence X \n1\n X \n2\n X \n3\n X \n4\n X \n5\n X \n6\n , is inserted and / or \n \n (iii) at least one oligopeptide sequence occurring naturally in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide is substituted by an oligopeptide comprising an amino acid sequence X \n1\n X \n2\n X \n3\n X \n4\n X \n5\n X \n6\n , \n \n in which \n X \n1\n = K, R or H; \n X \n2\n = K, R or H; \n X \n3\n = K, R, H or no amino acid; \n X \n4\n = no K, R, H, otherwise any amino acid; \n X \n5\n = no K, R, H, otherwise any or no amino acid; \n X \n6\n = no K, R, H, otherwise any or no amino acid, means (SEQ ID No: 1) \n or \n X \n1\n = K, R or H; \n X \n2\n = no K, R, H, any other amino acid; \n X \n3\n = K, R or H; \n X \n4\n = no K, R, H, otherwise any amino acid; \n X \n5\n = no K, R, H, otherwise any or no amino acid; \n X \n6\n = no K, R, H, otherwise any or no amino acid (SEQ ID No: 2), \n means. \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nIm nachfolgenden werden einige Begriffe näher erläutert, um klarzustellen, wie sie im Zusammenhang der vorliegenden Anmeldung verstanden werden sollen.\nIn the following some terms are explained in more detail in order to clarify how they should be understood in the context of the present application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDer Begriff \"Polypeptid\", so, wie er nachfolgend in der Beschreibung verwendet wird, umfaßt aus 5 oder mehr Aminosäuren zusammengesetzte Peptide oder Proteine, die wenigstens eine biologische Aktivität aufweisen. Der Begriff umfaßt ferner biologisch aktive Fragmente der Polypeptide, Mutanten und Fusionsproteine davon.\nThe term \"polypeptide\" as used hereinafter in the specification includes peptides or proteins composed of 5 or more amino acids having at least one biological activity. The term also includes biologically active fragments of the polypeptides, mutants and fusion proteins thereof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\"Polypeptidvariante mit erhöhter Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit\" bedeutet, daß die Polypeptidvariante eine Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit aufweist, die gegenüber der Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit des nicht veränderten Polypeptides erhöht ist. Die Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit allgemein kann beispielsweise durch Plasmonresonanz-Analyse mit Hilfe eines Heparin-beschichteten Trägers gemessen werden. Die einzelnen Versuchsbedingungen sind beispielsweise beschrieben in Ruppert et al., 1996.\n\"Polypeptide variant having enhanced heparin-binding ability\" means that the polypeptide variant has a heparin-binding ability which is increased over the heparin-binding ability of the unaltered polypeptide. The heparin-binding ability in general can be measured, for example, by plasmon resonance analysis using a heparin-coated carrier. The individual experimental conditions are described, for example, in Ruppert et al., 1996.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nUnter der \nin vivo\n Wirksamkeit wird das Ausmaß der bestimmungsgemäßen Wirkung am Zielort verstanden. Die \nin vivo\n Wirksamkeit wird bestimmt durch die biologische Aktivität des Proteins in Verbindung mit der Verfügbarkeit des Proteins am Zielort. Sie wird letztendlich gemessen als Wirkung am Zielort. Für die Messung der Wirkung kann auf etablierte Verfahren zurückgegriffen werden. Im Fall von BMP-2 Varianten hat sich die Induktion der ektopen Knochenbildung, beschrieben in Kübler & Urist, 1991 und Kübler et al., 1999, bewährt.\nIn \nvivo\n efficacy is understood to mean the extent of the intended effect at the target site. \nIn vivo\n activity is determined by the biological activity of the protein in conjunction with the availability of the protein at the target site. It is ultimately measured as an effect at the destination. For measuring the effect, established methods can be used. In the case of BMP-2 variants, the induction of ectopic bone formation described in Kübler & Urist, 1991 and Kübler et al., 1999 has been proven.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAls \"Wachstumsfaktor\" wird ein biologisch aktives Polypeptid bezeichnet, das das Wachstum und/oder die Differenzierung von Zellen moduliert.\nThe term \"growth factor\" refers to a biologically active polypeptide that modulates the growth and / or differentiation of cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nInsofern nachfolgend auf bestimmte Polypeptide eingegangen wird, so ist die Aminosäuresequenz beispielsweise erhältlich aus der öffentlich zugänglichen Datenbank Entrez (z.Zt.: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/).\nInsofar as certain polypeptides are discussed below, the amino acid sequence can be obtained, for example, from the publicly available Entrez database (currently: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDer dem Fachmann bekannte Ausdruck \"Homologie\" bezeichnet den Grad der Verwandtschaft zwischen zwei oder mehr Polypeptiden, der durch die Übereinstimmung zwischen den Aminosäuresequenzen mittels bekannter Verfahren, z. B. computergestützter Sequenzvergleiche (Basic local alignment search tool,\n \n S.F. Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215 (1990), 403-410\n \n) bestimmt wird. Der Prozentsatz der \"Homologie\" ergibt sich aus dem Prozentsatz identischer Bereiche in zwei oder mehr Sequenzen unter Berücksichtigung von Lücken oder anderen Sequenzbesonderheiten. In der Regel werden spezielle Computerprogramme mit Algorithmen eingesetzt, die den besonderen Anforderungen Rechung tragen.\nThe term \"homology\" known to those skilled in the art refers to the degree of relatedness between two or more polypeptides, as determined by the match  between the amino acid sequences by known methods, e.g. B. Computer-aided sequence comparisons (Basic local alignment search tool, \n \n SF Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215 (1990), 403-410 \n \n ) is determined. The percentage of \"homology\" results from the percentage of identical regions in two or more sequences, taking into account gaps or other sequence peculiarities. As a rule, special computer programs are used with algorithms that take the special requirements into account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBevorzugte Verfahren zur Bestimmung der Homologie erzeugen zunächst die größte Übereinstimmung zwischen den untersuchten Sequenzen. Computerprogramme zur Bestimmung der Homologie zwischen zwei Sequenzen umfassen, sind jedoch nicht eingeschränkt auf das GCG Programmpaket, einschließlich GAP (\n \nDevereux, J., et al., Nucleic Acids Research 12 (12) : 387 (1984\n \n); Genetics Computer Group University of Wisconsin, Madison, (WI)); BLASTP, BLASTIN, und FASTA (\n \nAltschul, S. et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410) (1990\n \n)). Das BLASTX Programm kann vom National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) und aus weiteren Quellen bezogen werden (BLAST Handbuch, Altschul S., et al., NCB NLM NIH Bethesda MD 20894; \n \nAltschul, S., et al., Mol. Bio. 215:403-410 (1990\n \n)). Auch der bekannte Smith Waterman-Algorithmus kann zur Bestimmung von Homologien verwendet werden.\nPreferred methods for determining homology first produce the closest match between the sequences examined. Computer programs for determining homology between two sequences include, but are not limited to, the GCG program package, including GAP ( \n \n Devereux, J., et al., Nucleic Acids Research 12 (12): 387 (1984 \n \n ); Genetics Computer Group University of Wisconsin, Madison, (WI)); BLASTP, BLASTIN, and FASTA ( \n \n Altschul, S. et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403-410) (1990 \n \n )). The BLASTX program can be obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and from other sources (BLAST Handbook, Altschul S., et al., NCB NLM NIH Bethesda MD 20894; \n \n Altschul, S., et al., Mol. Bio. 215: 403-410 (1990 \n \n )). The well-known Smith Waterman algorithm can also be used to determine homologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBevorzugte Parameter für den Aminosäuresequenz-Vergleich umfassen die nachstehenden:\n\n \nAlgorithmus:\n \n \n \n Needleman und Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol 48:443-453 (1970\n \n)\n \nVergleichsmatrix:\n \nBLOSUM 62 aus \n \nHenikoff und Henikoff, PNAS USA 89(1992), 10915-10919\n \n \n \nLücken-Wert (Gap Penalty):\n \n12\n \nLückenlängen-Wert: (Gap Length Penalty):\n \n4\n \n\nHomologie-Schwellenwert (Threshold of Similarity): 0Preferred parameters for the amino acid sequence comparison include the following: \n \n Algorithm: \n \n \n \n Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol 48: 443-453 (1970 \n \n ) \n \n Comparison matrix: \n \n BLOSUM 62 off \n \n Henikoff and Henikoff, PNAS USA 89 (1992), 10915-10919 \n \n \n \n Gap Penalty: \n \n 12 \n \n Gap Length Penalty: \n \n 4 \n \n Homology Threshold (Threshold of Similarity): 0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nDas GAP-Programm ist auch zur Verwendung mit den vorstehenden Parametern geeignet. Die vorstehenden Parameter sind die Fehler-Parameter (default parameters) für Aminosäuresequenz-Vergleiche, wobei Lücken an den Enden den Homologie-Wert nicht verringern. Bei sehr kurzen Sequenzen im Vergleich zur Referenzsequenz kann es weiterhin notwendig sein, den Erwartungswert auf bis zu 100.000 (expectation value) zu erhöhen und gegebenenfalls die Wortlänge (word size) auf bis zu 2 zu verkleinern.\nThe GAP program is also suitable for use with the above parameters. The above parameters are the default parameters for amino acid sequence comparisons, with gaps at the ends not lowering the homology value. For very short sequences compared to the reference sequence, it may further be necessary to increase the expectation value up to 100,000 (expectation value) and, if necessary, to reduce the word size to up to 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWeitere beispielhafte Algorithmen, Lücken-Öffnungs-Werte (gap opening penalties), Lückenausdehnungs-Werte (gap extension penalties), Vergleichsmatrizen einschließlich der im Programm-Handbuch, Wisconsin-Paket, Version 9, September 1997, genannten können verwendet werden. Die Auswahl wird von dem durchzuführenden Vergleich abhängen und weiterhin davon, ob der Vergleich zwischen Sequenzpaaren, wobei GAP oder Best Fit bevorzugt sind, oder zwischen einer Sequenz und einer umfangreichen Sequenz-Datenbank, wobei FASTA oder BLAST bevorzugt sind, durchgeführt wird.\nOther example algorithms, gap opening penalties, gap extension penalties, comparison matrices including those mentioned in the program manual, Wisconsin Package, version 9, September 1997, may be used. The selection will depend on the comparison to be made and will continue to be based on whether the comparison between sequence pairs, with GAP or Best Fit being preferred, or between a sequence and a large sequence database, with FASTA or BLAST being preferred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEine mit dem oben genannten Algorithmus ermittelte Übereinstimmung von 60 % wird im Rahmen dieser Anmeldung als 60 % Homologie bezeichnet. Entsprechendes gilt für höhere Homologiegrade.\nA 60% match established by the above algorithm is referred to as 60% homology for this application. The same applies to higher degrees of homology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\"His-Tag\" bedeutet eine Sequenz von wenigstens 6 Histidin-Aminosäuren, die durch entsprechende Klonierung und Fusion mit einer exprimierbaren Sequenz zu einem Fusionsprotein mit wenigstens 6 His-Resten am NH\n2\n-Terminus führt, das leicht durch Komplexierung mit einer Ni\n2+\n-Säule aufgereinigt werden kann.\n\"His-tag\" means a sequence of at least 6 histidine amino acids which, by appropriate cloning and fusion with an expressible sequence, results in a fusion protein having at least 6 His residues on the NH \n2\n -terminus readily by complexation with a Ni \n2+\n Column can be purified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nUnter einem \"heterologen Gen\" ist der kodierende Bereich eines Strukturgens zu verstehen, der entweder nicht unter der Kontrolle des eigenen (homologen) Promotors oder nicht in dem Organismus, aus dem er abgeleitet ist, oder weder unter der Kontrolle des eigenen Promotors noch im ursprünglichen Organismus exprimiert wird.\nBy a \"heterologous gene\" is meant the coding region of a structural gene which is either not under the control of its own (homologous) promoter or not in the organism from which it is derived or neither under the control of its own promoter nor in the original one Organism is expressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\"Klonierung\" soll alle im Stand der Technik bekannten Klonierungsmethoden umfassen, die hier zum Einsatz kommen könnten, die jedoch nicht alle im einzelnen beschrieben werden, weil sie zum selbstverständlichen Handwerkszeug des Fachmanns gehören.\n\"Cloning\" is intended to include all known in the art cloning methods that could be used here, but not all of which are described in detail because they belong to the obvious tools of the art. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nUnter \"rekombinanter Expression in einer geeigneten Wirtszelle\" sollen alle im Stand der Technik bekannten Expressionsmethoden in bekannten Expressionssystemen verstanden werden, die hier zum Einsatz kommen könnten, jedoch nicht alle im einzelnen beschrieben werden, weil sie zum selbstverständlichen Handwerkszeug des Fachmanns gehören.\n\"Recombinant expression in a suitable host cell\" is intended to mean all known in the art expression methods in known expression systems that could be used here, but not all are described in detail because they belong to the obvious tools of the art.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nÜberraschenderweise wurde nun gefunden, daß eine erfindungsgemäße Polypeptidvariante eine höhere Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit gegenüber dem nicht veränderten Polypeptid dadurch aufweist, daß wenigstens ein Oligopeptid, das eine erfindungsgemäße Aminosäuresequenz umfaßt, an das Polypeptid addiert und/oder in das Polypeptid inseriert wird und/oder einige der Aminosäuren als Polypeptide ersetzt. Es konnte gezeigt werden, daß im Vergleich zum nicht veränderten Polypeptid die Menge der an Heparin gebundenen Varianten größer ist und daß außerdem die Abdissoziierung der Varianten von Heparin verringert ist. Da Heparin-ähnliche Strukturen integrale Bestandteile der Knochenstruktur sind, weisen die erfindungsgemäßen Polypeptidvarianten auch eine erhöhte Bindungsfähigkeit für Knochenstrukturen auf. Diese Eigenschaft ist besonders wichtig für regenerative Vorgänge in der Knochenstruktur, wobei in diesem Fall die beteiligten Polypeptide an der Knochenmorphogenese (Osteogenese) mitwirken. Es konnte dabei gezeigt werden, daß die erfindungsgemäßen Polypeptidvarianten die Heparinbindungsfähigkeit um den Faktor 30, mindestens aber den Faktor 10 steigern konnten. Die erhöhte Heparinbindungsfähigkeit wiederum führte zu einer dramatisch gesteigerten \nin vivo\n Wirksamkeit, wie z. B. durch die \nFigur 8\n belegt.\nSurprisingly, it has now been found that a polypeptide variant according to the invention has a higher heparin-binding ability compared to the unaltered polypeptide in that at least one oligopeptide comprising an amino acid sequence according to the invention is added to the polypeptide and / or inserted into the polypeptide and / or some of the Amino acids replaced as polypeptides. It has been shown that compared to the unaltered polypeptide, the amount of heparin-bound variants is greater and, in addition, the dissociation of heparin variants is reduced. Since heparin-like structures are integral components of the bone structure, the polypeptide variants according to the invention also have an increased binding capacity for bone structures. This property is particularly important for regenerative processes in the bone structure, in which case the polypeptides involved participate in bone morphogenesis (osteogenesis). It could be shown that the polypeptide variants according to the invention could increase the heparin-binding capacity by a factor of 30, but at least a factor of 10. The increased heparin-binding ability, in turn, resulted in dramatically increased \nin vivo\n efficacy, such as \nin vivo\n . B. by the \n FIG. 8 \n busy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWie erwähnt, wird die Wirkung der an der Osteogenese beteiligten Polypeptide durch Rezeptoren vermittelt, die u.a. auf der Oberfläche von induzierbaren Knochenmarksstroma-Stammzellen vorkommen. Diese haben die Fähigkeit, nach Einwirkung eines induktiven Signals von morphogenetischen Proteinen oder demineralisierter Knochenmatrix, Knochenzellen auszubilden. Es wird angenommen, ohne an diese Theorie gebunden sein zu wollen, daß die Erhöhung der Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit von Polypeptiden, insbesondere von osteoinduktiven Polypeptiden, zur Erhöhung der lokalen Konzentration von osteogenetischen Proteinen in unmittelbarer Nähe des Ortes der Knochenneubildung führt.\nAs mentioned, the effect of the polypeptides involved in osteogenesis is mediated by receptors found, inter alia, on the surface of inducible marrow stromal stem cells. These have the ability to form bone cells after exposure to an inductive signal from morphogenetic proteins or demineralized bone matrix. It is believed, without wishing to be bound by theory, that increasing the heparin-binding ability of polypeptides, particularly osteoinductive polypeptides, to increase local  Concentration of osteogenic proteins in the immediate vicinity of the place of new bone formation leads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDa jedoch Heparin mit dem zellulären Rezeptor des Polypeptides um die Polypeptidvariante konkurriert, ist zunächst davon auszugehen, daß die Erhöhung der Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit der Polypeptidvariante zu einer Abnahme der für den Polypeptidspezifischen Rezeptor verfügbaren Polypeptid-Menge und damit zu einer verminderten Signaltransduktion führt.\nHowever, since heparin competes with the cellular receptor for the polypeptide variant, it is initially believed that increasing the heparin-binding ability of the polypeptide variant results in a decrease in the amount of polypeptide available to the polypeptide-specific receptor, and thus decreased signal transduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nÜberraschenderweise wurde nun gefunden, daß die biologische Verfügbarkeit der Polypeptidvariante bei gleichzeitiger Erhöhung der Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit nicht beeinträchtigt ist, daß vielmehr die erhöhte Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit mit einer Erhöhung der lokalen Konzentration von für den spezifischen Rezeptor verfügbarem Polypeptid korreliert.\nSurprisingly, it has now been found that the bioavailability of the polypeptide variant is not impaired with a concomitant increase in heparin-binding capacity, but that the increased heparin-binding ability correlates with an increase in the local concentration of polypeptide available for the specific receptor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWeiterhin wurde überraschenderweise gefunden, daß die Qualität des durch die Polypeptidvariante \nin vivo\n gebildeten Knochens gegenüber derjenigen, die durch das nicht veränderte Polypeptid gebildet wurde, erhöht ist.\nFurthermore, it has surprisingly been found that the quality of bone formed by the polypeptide variant \nin vivo is increased\n over that produced by the unaltered polypeptide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn einer bevorzugten Ausführungsform ist die erfindungsgemäße Aminosäuresequenz an den N-Terminus des reifen Polypeptids addiert und/oder durch Substitution bzw. Insertion in den N-terminalen Bereich des Polypeptides eingefügt. Der N-terminale Bereich bedeutet hierbei die ersten 20, vorzugsweise die ersten fünf, N-terminalen Aminosäuren.\nIn a preferred embodiment, the amino acid sequence according to the invention is added to the N-terminus of the mature polypeptide and / or inserted by substitution or insertion into the N-terminal region of the polypeptide. The N-terminal region here means the first 20, preferably the first five, N-terminal amino acids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSofern das Polypeptid zur TGF-β Superfamilie gehört, sind die reifen Polypeptide, z. B. ausgehend von BMP-2, wie folgt ermittelbar: Eine Suche in der \"Swiss-Prot\" Datenbank (derzeit http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/sprot-search-de) mit dem Suchwort \"BMP-2\" ergibt unter der Nummer P12643 die Aminosäuresequenz des gesamten Proproteins von humanem BMP-2. Daraus läßt sich unter \"bone morphogenetic protein 2\" die Sequenz für das reife Protein auswählen. Sie entspricht den Aminosäureresten 283-396. Um die anderen Proteine der TGF-β Superfamilie zu identifzieren, wird diese Sequenz 283-396 unter \"BLAST2\" bei EMBnet-CH (Lausanne, Schweiz) eingereicht. Dort wird sie gegen die Datenbanken Swiss-Prot + TrEMBL + TrEMBL_New mit Hilfe des Programms \"blastp\" abgesucht. Dabei wird die Vergleichsmatrix Blosum 62 verwendet, und es werden die 250 am nächsten verwandten Proteine ermittelt. Das Programm liefert die entsprechenden Identitäts-Nummern der Swiss-Prot Datenbank, unter denen sich die Aminosäuresequenzen der gesamten Proproteine aufrufen lassen. Die Sequenzabschnitte für die reifen Proteine sind jeweils angegeben. Sie ließen sich sonst auch ableiten, da die reifen Proteine gewöhnlich nach der Erkennungssequenz RXXR abgespalten werden (X bedeutet hier eine beliebige Aminosäure).\nIf the polypeptide belongs to the TGF-β superfamily, the mature polypeptides, e.g. B. based on BMP-2, as follows: A search in the \"Swiss-Prot\" database (currently http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/sprot-search-de) with the search term \"BMP- 2 \"gives under number P12643 the amino acid sequence of the entire protein of human BMP-2. From this, the sequence for the mature protein can be selected under \"bone \nmorphogenetic protein\n 2\". It corresponds to amino acid residues 283-396. To identify the other TGF-β superfamily proteins, this sequence becomes 283-396  filed under \"BLAST2\" at EMBnet-CH (Lausanne, Switzerland). There it is searched against the databases Swiss-Prot + TrEMBL + TrEMBL_New with the help of the program \"blastp\". The comparison matrix Blosum 62 is used and the 250 most closely related proteins are determined. The program provides the corresponding identity numbers of the Swiss-Prot database, under which the amino acid sequences of the entire proproteins can be called. The sequence sections for the mature proteins are indicated in each case. Otherwise, they could also be derived, since the mature proteins are usually cleaved after the recognition sequence RXXR (X here means any amino acid).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAlle Polypeptide der TGF-β Superfamilie sind, wie schon erwähnt, durch ein Strukturelement gekennzeichnet, das als \"Cystinknoten\" bezeichnet wird (McDonald und Hendrickson, 1993). Gehört das Polypeptid zu dieser Superfamilie, so gilt der gesamte Bereich vor dem Cystinknoten als N-terminaler Bereich, und die erfindungsgemäße Aminosäuresequenz wird vorzugsweise vor dem Cystinknoten eingefügt.\nAll polypeptides of the TGF-β superfamily are, as already mentioned, characterized by a structural element called \"cystine knot\" (McDonald and Hendrickson, 1993). If the polypeptide belongs to this superfamily, the entire region in front of the cystine node is considered an N-terminal region, and the amino acid sequence according to the invention is preferably inserted in front of the cystine node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn einer besonders bevorzugten Ausführungsform ist das Oligopeptid, das die erfindungsgemäße Aminosäuresequenz umfaßt, ein bis viermal durch Addition, Insertion und/oder Substitution in das Polypeptid eingefügt, wobei jeweils ein oder mehrere Kopien des Oligopeptids an einer oder mehreren Positionen in das Polypeptid eingefügt werden können.\nIn a particularly preferred embodiment, the oligopeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of the invention is inserted one to four times into the polypeptide by addition, insertion and / or substitution, wherein one or more copies of the oligopeptide may be inserted into the polypeptide at one or more positions ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn einer besonders bevorzugten Ausführungsform hat das Oligopeptid die Sequenz RKRA (SEQ ID No. 3) oder die Sequenz RKRAKHKQ (SEQ ID No. 4).\nIn a particularly preferred embodiment, the oligopeptide has the sequence RKRA (SEQ ID No. 3) or the sequence RKRAKHKQ (SEQ ID No. 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWeiterhin ist bevorzugt, daß die Polypeptidvariante eine für die rekombinante Expression relevante Sequenz am N-Terminus umfaßt, wobei die für die rekombinante Expression relevante Sequenz M oder MZ ist, und M Methionin und Z eine oder mehrere beliebige Aminosäuren bedeutet. MZ kann beispielsweise eine Signalsequenz darstellen, wie sie für zahlreiche prokaryontische und eukaryontische Proteine dem Fachmann bekannt ist. Es kann sich dabei um auf das jeweilige Expressionssystem zugeschnittene Signalsequenzen handeln oder aber um die \"homologen\" Signalsequenzen, d.h., die zu dem Protein natürlicherweise gehörenden Signalsequenzen, sowie schließlich um eine Kombination einer beliebigen Signalsequenz mit gezielt eingefügten Proteaseschnittstellen, etc.\nFurthermore, it is preferred that the polypeptide variant comprises a sequence relevant for recombinant expression at the N-terminus, wherein the sequence relevant for recombinant expression is M or MZ, and M is methionine and Z is one or more arbitrary amino acids. For example, MZ can be a signal sequence known to a person skilled in the art for numerous prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins. These may be signal sequences tailored to the respective expression system or else the \"homologous\" ones.  Signal sequences, ie, the signal sequences naturally belonging to the protein, and finally a combination of any signal sequence with selectively inserted protease cleavage sites, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFerner ist bevorzugt, daß die Polypeptidvariante ein His-Tag umfaßt. Das His-Tag am NH\n2\n-Terminus der Polypeptidvariante erleichtert die Aufreinigung des Proteins wesentlich, da diese Aufreinigung an einer Nickel-Säule durch Chelat-Bildung durchgeführt werden kann.\nIt is further preferred that the polypeptide variant comprises a His tag. The His tag on the NH \n2\n -terminus of the polypeptide variant facilitates the purification of the protein substantially, since this purification can be carried out on a nickel column by chelate formation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDas der Polypeptidvariante zugrundeliegende Polypeptid weist eine biologische Aktivität auf. Hierbei sind grundsätzlich sämtliche biologischen Aktivitäten von Interesse, bei denen die Wirksamkeit eines Polypeptides mit biologischer Aktivität durch das Wegdiffundieren von negativ geladenen intra- und extrazellulären Strukturen limitiert ist. Vorzugsweise sind diese negativ geladenen Strukturen Strukturen der extrazellulären Matrix, die aufgrund ihres Anteils an Proteoglykanen und Glykosaminoglykanen, wie Heparansulfat, Chondroitinsulfat, Keratansulfat und Dermatansulfat, negativ geladen sind. In einer bevorzugten Ausführungsform reguliert die biologische Aktivität die Entwicklung bzw. Differenzierung von Zellen, Geweben und Organen des menschlichen oder tierischen Körpers.\nThe polypeptide underlying the polypeptide variant has a biological activity. In principle, all biological activities in which the activity of a polypeptide having biological activity is limited by the path-diffusing of negatively charged intracellular and extracellular structures are of interest. Preferably, these negatively charged structures are extracellular matrix structures that are negatively charged due to their content of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, such as heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate, and dermatan sulfate. In a preferred embodiment, the biological activity regulates the development or differentiation of cells, tissues and organs of the human or animal body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBesonders bevorzugt ist hierbei, daß das der Polypeptidvariante zugrundeliegende Polypeptid die Knochenbildung reguliert (osteogenetische Aktivität). Die osteogenetische Aktivität kann hierbei beispielsweise durch den Wachstumsfaktor-abhängigen Einbau von \n35\nSO\n4\n in Proteoglykan-Strukturen von Gliedmaßenknospen aus Hühnerembryonen bestimmt werden. Sinnvollerweise wird dazu ein Konzentrationsbereich für das BMP-Protein gewählt, der es ermöglicht, sowohl die maximale Zellantwort als auch die EC\n50\n (Konzentration, bei der 50% des maximalen Einbaus erreicht werden) zu bestimmen. Die Assay-Bedingungen sind angegeben in Ruppert et al., 1996.\nIt is particularly preferred here that the polypeptide on which the polypeptide variant is based regulates bone formation (osteogenic activity). The osteogenic activity can be determined, for example, by the growth factor-dependent incorporation of \n35\n SO \n4\n into proteoglycan structures of limb buds from chick embryos. It makes sense to select a concentration range for the BMP protein that will allow to determine both the maximal cell response and the EC \n50\n (concentration at which 50% of maximum incorporation is achieved). The assay conditions are given in Ruppert et al., 1996.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAlternativ kann die myoblastäre Maus-Zelllinie C2C12 verwendet werden, um die BMP-abhängige Induktion der Alkalischen Phosphatase zu bestimmen (Katagiri et al., 1994) Auch mit diesem Test können die maximale Zellantwort und die EC\n50\n bestimmt werden. Bevorzugt ist das Polypeptid aus der Hormone, Cytokine und Wachstumsfaktoren umfassenden Gruppe ausgewählt. Hierbei sind besonders bevorzugt:\n\n \nParathormon (PTH); Calcitonin; Wachstumshormon; Insulin-like growth factor (IGF); Cytokine, die den Knochenabbau bewirken, wie IL-1, Tumornekrose-Faktor (TNF), IL-6, IL-11 und ODF (Osteoklastendifferenzierungsfaktor, TRANCE); Cytokine, die den Knochenabbau verhindern: IL-4, IL-13, IL-18, IFN (Interferon), OPG (Osteoprotegerin) und IL-1ra (Interleukin-1-Rezeptor-Antagonist); Kolonie-stimulierende Faktoren: M-CSF (Makrophagen-Kolonie stimulierender Faktor) und GM-CSF (Granulozyten-Makrophagen stimulierender Faktor); und Wachstumsfaktoren: IGF (Insulin-like growth factor; Insulin-artiger Wachstumsfaktor); Proteine aus der DVR-Familie einschließlich der Proteine aus der TGF-β (transforming growth factor β; transformierender Wachstumsfaktor β)-Superfamilie, die wiederum die Activin/Inhibin-Familie, MIS (Mullerian Inhibitory Substance; Müllerscher Inhibitor), die GDF (growth/differentiation factor; Wachstums-/Differenzierungsfaktor)-Familie, Nodal und Dorsalin umfaßt; FGF (fibroblast growth factor; Fibroblastenwachstumsfaktor); PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor; Blutplättchen-abstammender Wachstumsfaktor) und PTHrP (PTH-related protein; Parathormon-verwandtes Protein).\n \n Alternatively, the mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 can be used to determine the BMP-dependent induction of alkaline phosphatase (Katagiri et al., 1994). Also with this assay, the maximal cell response and EC \n50\n can be determined.  Preferably, the polypeptide is selected from the group comprising hormones, cytokines and growth factors. Here are particularly preferred: \n \n Parathyroid hormone (PTH); calcitonin; Growth hormone; Insulin-like growth factor (IGF); Cytokines that cause bone degradation, such as IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, IL-11, and ODF (osteoclast differentiation factor, TRANCE); Cytokines that prevent bone resorption: IL-4, IL-13, IL-18, IFN (interferon), OPG (osteoprotegerin), and IL-1ra (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist); Colony stimulating factors: M-CSF (macrophage colony stimulating factor) and GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage stimulating factor); and growth factors: insulin-like growth factor (IGF); Proteins from the DVR family including proteins from the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily, which in turn include the activin / inhibin family, MIS (Mullerian Inhibitory Substance), the GDF (growth differentiation factor) family, nodal and dorsalin; FGF (fibroblast growth factor); Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PTHrP (PTH-related protein). \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBesonders bevorzugt umfaßt das Polypeptid Mitglieder der TGF β-Superfamilie, Activin/Inhibin-Familie, MIS, GDF-Familie, Nodal und Dorsalin, sowie Mitglieder der BMP-Familie, insbesondere BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6, BMP-7/OP-1 oder BMP-8/OP-2, sowie BMP-9, BMP-10, BMP-11, BMP-12, BMP-13, BMP-14 und BMP-15.\nMore preferably, the polypeptide comprises members of the TGF β superfamily, activin / inhibin family, MIS, GDF family, nodal and dorsal, as well as members of the BMP family, in particular BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP- 6, BMP-7 / OP-1 or BMP-8 / OP-2, as well as BMP-9, BMP-10, BMP-11, BMP-12, BMP-13, BMP-14 and BMP-15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie vorstehende Auswahl von Wachstumsfaktoren ist erfindungsgemäß von besonderem Interesse, da die Beteiligung dieser Faktoren an der Osteogenese bekannt ist (Reddi, 1998); die Verwendung der erfindungsgemäßen Varianten dieser Faktoren führt zu einer erhöhten Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit unter Beibehaltung der osteoinduktiven Eigenschaften.\nThe above selection of growth factors is of particular interest in the present invention, as the involvement of these factors in osteogenesis is known (Reddi, 1998); the use of the variants of these factors according to the invention leads to an increased heparin-binding capacity while maintaining the osteoinductive properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSofern das Polypeptid der TGF-β Superfamilie angehört und somit die vorstehend erläuterte \"Cystinknoten\"-Struktur aufweist, wird die erfindungsgemäße Aminosäuresequenz bevorzugt vor den Cystinknoten in die Polypeptidsequenz eingefügt. Besonders bevorzugte Positionen sind beispielsweise bei BMP-2 die Positionen zwischen den Aminosäureresten 2 und 3, 6 und 7, 10 und 11 sowie 13 und 14 des reifen Proteins. Aufgrund der Homologie zwischen den Mitgliedern der TGF-β Familie, insbesondere der konservierten Anordnung der Cysteine, kann der Fachmann den genannten Proteinen entsprechende Positionen in anderen TGF-β Familienmitgliedern bestimmen.\nIf the polypeptide belongs to the TGF-β superfamily and thus has the above-described \"cystine knot\" structure, the amino acid sequence according to the invention becomes  preferably inserted in front of the cystine nodes in the polypeptide sequence. For example, particularly preferred positions in BMP-2 are the positions between \namino acid residues\n 2 and 3, 6 and 7, 10 and 11 and 13 and 14 of the mature protein. Because of the homology between the members of the TGF-β family, particularly the conserved arrangement of cysteines, one skilled in the art can determine corresponding positions in other TGF-β family members for said proteins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDas Polypeptid kann ferner ein Hormon, ein Cytokin oder ein Wachstumsfaktor sein, der eine Addition, Substitution, Insertion, Inversion und/ oder Deletionen aufweist, wobei das die Addition, Substitution, Insertion, Inversion und/oder Deletion aufweisende Polypeptid wenigstens 10 %, vorzugsweise wenigstens 50 % und insbesondere wenigstens 90 % der biologischen Aktivität, im Fall osteogenetischer Polypeptide der osteogenetischen Aktivität des ursprünglichen Polypeptids aufweist. Die biologische Aktivität kann hierbei allgemein mit jedem dem Fachmann bekannten Verfahren zur Messung der biologischen Aktivität des Polypeptides bestimmt werden.\nThe polypeptide may further be a hormone, a cytokine or a growth factor having an addition, substitution, insertion, inversion and / or deletions, wherein the addition, substitution, insertion, inversion and / or deletion polypeptide is at least 10%, preferably at least 50% and especially at least 90% of the biological activity, in the case of osteogenic polypeptides, of the osteogenic activity of the original polypeptide. The biological activity can generally be determined by any method known to those skilled in the art for measuring the biological activity of the polypeptide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn einer weiteren bevorzugten Ausführungsform sind die durch Addition, Substitution, Insertion, Inversion oder Deletion erhaltenen Polypeptide wenigstens 50 %, vorzugsweise 75 % und insbesondere 90 % homolog zur Aminosäuresequenz des vollständigen ursprünglichen Polypeptids. Dabei kann eine wenigstens 10%ige biologische Aktivität mit einer mindestens 50%igen, mindestens 75%igen oder mindestens 90%igen Homologie korrelieren. Gleiches gilt für eine wenigstens 50%ige oder wenigstens 90%ige biologische Aktivität.\nIn a further preferred embodiment, the polypeptides obtained by addition, substitution, insertion, inversion or deletion are at least 50%, preferably 75% and in particular 90% homologous to the amino acid sequence of the complete original polypeptide. In this case, an at least 10% biological activity can correlate with at least 50%, at least 75% or at least 90% homology. The same applies to at least 50% or at least 90% biological activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBesonders bevorzugt sind Polypeptidvarianten mit der Aminosäuresequenz SEQ ID No 5 (T3) oder SEQ ID No 6 (T4). Diese Polypeptidvarianten entsprechen den in den Beispielen verwendeten Polypeptidvarianten, die eine erhöhte Wirksamkeit bei gleicher Konzentration und eine verbesserte Qualität des induzierten Knochens zeigen, wobei unter verbesserter Qualität insbesondere eine dichtere Knochenmatrix und damit eine erhöhte biomechanische Belastbarkeit zu verstehen sind.\nParticularly preferred are polypeptide variants with the amino acid sequence SEQ ID No 5 (T3) or SEQ ID No 6 (T4). These polypeptide variants correspond to the polypeptide variants used in the examples, which show increased efficacy at the same concentration and improved quality of the induced bone, whereby improved quality is to be understood as meaning, in particular, a denser bone matrix and thus an increased biomechanical loading capacity. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn einer weiteren bevorzugten Ausführungsform wird die erfindungsgemäß hergestellte Polypeptidvariante modifiziert. Die Modifikationen umfassen hierbei die Di-, Oligo- und Polymerisierung des monomeren Ausgangsprodukts, beispielsweise durch Quervernetzung, z.B. durch Dicyclohexylcarbodiimid oder Pegylierung oder Assoziation (self assembly). Die somit hergestellten Di-, Oligo- und Polymere können voneinander beispielsweise durch Gelfiltration abgetrennt werden. Weitere Modifikationen umfassen Seitenketten-Modifikationen, beispielsweise von ε-Amino-Lysin-Resten der Polypeptidvariante, oder Amino- bzw. Carboxy-terminale Modifikationen. Schließlich umfaßt der Begriff Modifikationen posttranslationale Ereignisse, z.B. die Glykosylierung oder die partielle oder vollständige Deglykosylierung des Proteins.\nIn a further preferred embodiment, the polypeptide variant prepared according to the invention is modified. The modifications herein include di-, oligo- and polymerization of the monomeric starting product, for example by cross-linking, e.g. by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or pegylation or association (self assembly). The di-, oligo- and polymers thus prepared can be separated from one another, for example by gel filtration. Further modifications include side-chain modifications, for example of ε-amino-lysine residues of the polypeptide variant, or amino- or carboxy-terminal modifications. Finally, the term modifications includes post-translational events, e.g. glycosylation or partial or complete deglycosylation of the protein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie Erfindung stellt ferner Nukleinsäuremoleküle bereit, die eine für eine erfindungsgemäße Polypeptidvariante kodierende Nukleinsäuresequenz umfassen.\nThe invention further provides nucleic acid molecules comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide variant of the invention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie im erfindungsgemäßen Nukleinsäuremolekül enthaltene Nukleinsäuresequenz kann von einer genomischen DNA, cDNA oder synthetischen DNA abgeleitet sein, wobei unter synthetischen DNA-Sequenzen auch solche verstanden werden, die modifizierte Internukleosid-Bindungen enthalten. Weiterhin kann es sich bei den Nukleinsäuresequenzen um RNA-Sequenzen handeln, was z.B. für die Expression mittels rekombinanter RNA-Vektorsysteme erforderlich sein kann.\nThe nucleic acid sequence contained in the nucleic acid molecule according to the invention can be derived from a genomic DNA, cDNA or synthetic DNA, whereby synthetic DNA sequences are also understood to mean those which contain modified internucleoside bonds. Furthermore, the nucleic acid sequences may be RNA sequences, e.g. may be required for expression by recombinant RNA vector systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBevorzugte Nukleinsäuremoleküle umfassen eine für eine der Polypeptidvarianten T3 oder T4 kodierende Nukleinsäure. Beispiele solcher Nukleinsäuren sind im Sequenzprotokoll unter SEQ ID No. 7 (T3) und SEQ ID No. 8 (T4) angegeben. Es versteht sich von selbst, daß anstelle der in SEQ ID No. 7 oder SEQ ID No. 8 angegebenen Nukleinsäuresequenzen solche, die auf einer Degeneration des genetischen Codes beruhen, ebenfalls verwendet werden können. Bevorzugt sind in diesem Zusammenhang Nukleinsäuresequenzen, die im Hinblick auf die Expression in einem bestimmten Wirtsorganismus eine an den Codon-Gebrauch dieses Wirtsorganismus adaptierte Codon-Auswahl aufweisen. Zu den vorgenannten Sequenzen komplementäre Sequenzen sind von der Erfindung ebenfalls umfaßt.\nPreferred nucleic acid molecules comprise a nucleic acid coding for one of the polypeptide variants T3 or T4. Examples of such nucleic acids are shown in the sequence listing under SEQ ID NO. 7 (T3) and SEQ ID NO. 8 (T4). It goes without saying that instead of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID no. 7 or SEQ ID NO. Nucleic acid sequences which are based on a degeneracy of the genetic code can also be used. In this connection, preference is given to nucleic acid sequences which, with regard to expression in a particular host organism, have a codon selection adapted to the codon usage of this host organism. Complementary sequences to the aforementioned sequences are also included in the invention. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn einer bevorzugten Ausführungsform umfaßt das erfindungsgemäße Nukleinsäuremolekül einen zur Expression geeigneten Promotor, wobei die Nukleinsäuresequenz unter der Kontrolle des Promotors steht. Die Wahl des Promotors hängt vom zur Expression verwendeten Expressionssystem ab. Generell sind induzierbare Promotoren, wie z.B. der Metallothionein-Promotor, bevorzugt, jedoch sind auch konstitutive Promotoren möglich.\nIn a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule of the invention comprises a promoter suitable for expression, wherein the nucleic acid sequence is under the control of the promoter. The choice of promoter depends on the expression system used for expression. In general, inducible promoters, e.g. the metallothionein promoter is preferred, but constitutive promoters are also possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn einer weiteren bevorzugten Ausführungsform umfaßt das Nukleinsäuremolekül wenigstens einen Teil eines Vektors, insbesondere regulatorische Regionen, wobei der Vektor ausgewählt sein kann aus Bakteriophagen wie λ-Derivaten, Adenoviren, Vacciniaviren, Baculoviren, SV40-Virus, Retroviren, Plasmiden, wie Ti-Plasmide von \nAgrobacterium tumefaciens,\n YAC-Vektoren und BAC-Vektoren. Bevorzugte Vektoren sind pR\nTS\npRC 109 (Weigel et al., 1989) und pRBSIIPN\n25\nx/o (Stueber, 1994).\nIn a further preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule comprises at least part of a vector, in particular regulatory regions, which vector may be selected from bacteriophages such as λ derivatives, adenoviruses, vaccinia viruses, baculoviruses, SV40 virus, retroviruses, plasmids such as Ti plasmids of \nAgrobacterium tumefaciens,\n YAC vectors and BAC vectors. Preferred vectors are pR \nTS\n pRC 109 (Weigel et al., 1989) and pRBSIIPN \n25\n x / o (Stueber, 1994).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFerner stellt die Erfindung Wirtszellen bereit, die das Nukleinsäuremolekül enthalten und die zur Expression des Nukleinsäuremoleküls geeignet sind. Im Stand der Technik sind zahlreiche prokaryontische und eukaryontische Expressionssysteme bekannt, wobei die Wirtszellen beispielsweise ausgewählt sind aus prokaryontischen Zellen, wie \nE. coli\n oder \nB. subtilis,\n aus eukaryontischen Zellen, wie Hefezellen, Pflanzenzellen, Insektenzellen und Säugerzellen, z.B. CHO-Zellen, COS-Zellen oder HeLa-Zellen, sowie Derivaten davon. Im Stand der Technik sind beispielsweise bestimmte CHO-Produktlonslinien bekannt, deren Glykosylierungsmuster im Vergleich zu CHO-Zellen verändert sind. Die durch die Verwendung Glykosylierung-effizienter oder Glykosylierung-verringerter Wirtszellen erhaltenen Polypeptidvarianten verfügen möglicherweise über eine veränderte räumliche Struktur, die gegebenenfalls zu einer erhöhten biologischen Aktivität gegenüber der glykosylierten Polypeptidvariante führen kann, sofern das Polypeptid biologische Aktivität aufweist.\nFurthermore, the invention provides host cells which contain the nucleic acid molecule and which are suitable for expression of the nucleic acid molecule. Numerous prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems are known in the art, the host cells for example being selected from prokaryotic cells, such as \nE. coli\n or \nB. subtilis,\n from eukaryotic cells, such as yeast cells, plant cells, insect cells and mammalian cells, eg CHO cells, COS Cells or HeLa cells, as well as derivatives thereof. For example, in the art, certain CHO product lines are known whose glycosylation patterns are altered compared to CHO cells. The polypeptide variants obtained by the use of glycosylation-efficient or glycosylated-reduced host cells may have an altered spatial structure which may, if appropriate, lead to an increased biological activity towards the glycosylated polypeptide variant, provided that the polypeptide has biological activity. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGegenstand der vorliegenden Erfindung ist ein verfahren zum Herstellen einer Polpeptidvariante mit erhöhter Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit gemäss Anspruch 1, umfassend das Addieren wenigstens eines Oligopeptides, das eine Aminosäuresequenz enthält, die ausgewählt ist aus: SEQ ID NO: 3 und SEQ ID NO: 4, an die Aminosäuresequenz eines Polpeptides;\n\nund/oder das Inserieren wenigstens eines Oligopeptides, das eine Aminosäuresequenz enthält, die ausgewählt ist aus: SEQ ID NO: 3 und SEQ ID NO: 4 eines Polpeptides; und/oder das Substituieren wenigstens einer natürlicherweise in der Aminosäuresequenz eines Polpeptids vorkommenden Oligopeptidsequenz durch ein Oligopeptid, das eine Aminosäuresequenz enthält, die ausgewählt ist aus: SEQ ID NO: 3 und SEQ ID NO: 4.\nThe present invention is a process for the preparation of a polypeptide variant with increased heparin-binding ability according to \nclaim\n 1, comprising adding at least one oligopeptide containing an amino acid sequence selected from: SEQ ID NO: 3 and SEQ ID NO: 4, to the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide;

and / or (ii) inserting into the polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid at least one nucleic acid encoding an oligopeptide containing an amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID NOS: 3 and 4; and / or (iii) at least one nucleic acid sequence naturally occurring in the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide is substituted by a nucleic acid sequence encoding an oligopeptide containing an amino acid sequence selected from: SEQ ID NO: 3 and SEQ ID NO: 4 ;

\n \n e) isolation and optionally renaturation of the expressed polypeptide variant. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFerner ist hierin ein Verfahren zum Herstellen einer Polpeptidvariante mit erhöhter Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit beschrieben, umfassend das Addieren wenigstens eines Oligopeptides, enthaltend eine Aminosäuresequenz, die aus: SEQ ID NO: 1 und SEQ ID NO: 2 ausgewählt ist, an die Aminosäuresequenz eines Polypeptids, und/oder das Inserieren wenigstens eines Oligopeptids, das eine Aminosäuresequenz enthält, die aus: SEQ ID No: 1 und SEQ No: 2 ausgewählt ist, in die Aminosäuresequenz des Polypeptids; und/oder das Substituieren wenigstens einer natürlicherweise in der Aminosäuresequenz vorkommenden Oligopeptidsequenz durch ein Oligopeptid, das eine Aminosäuresequenz enthält, die aus: SEQ ID No: 1 und SEQ No: 2 ausgewählt ist.\nAlso described herein is a method of making a polypeptide variant having enhanced heparin binding ability comprising adding to the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide at least one oligopeptide containing an amino acid sequence selected from: SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 2;  and / or inserting into the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide at least one oligopeptide containing an amino acid sequence selected from: SEQ ID No: 1 and SEQ No: 2; and / or substituting at least one oligopeptide sequence naturally occurring in the amino acid sequence by an oligopeptide containing an amino acid sequence selected from: SEQ ID No: 1 and SEQ No: 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDas Verfahren kann durch chemische Partial- oder Total-Synthese, unter Verwendung der bekannten Merrifield-Synthese oder durch enzymatische Synthese durchgeführt werden. Weiterhin kann das Verfahren gentechnologisch, d.h. durch rekombinante Expression durchgeführt werden. Die Erfindung umfaßt ferner auch die Kombination aus chemischen/enzymatischen und gentechnologischen Verfahren.\nThe process can be carried out by partial or total chemical synthesis, using the known Merrifield synthesis or by enzymatic synthesis. Furthermore, the method can be genetically engineered, i. be carried out by recombinant expression. The invention also includes the combination of chemical / enzymatic and genetic engineering methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn einer bevorzugten Form umfaßt das Verfahren:\n\n \na) \nin vitro\n Mutagenese einer für ein Polypeptid kodierenden Nukleinsäure, so daß (i) an die für das Polypeptid kodierende Nukleinsäure wenigstens eine Nukleinsäure addiert wird, die für ein Oligopeptid kodiert, das eine Aminosäuresequenz enthält, die aus SEQ ID No: 1 und SEQ ID No: 2 ausgewählt ist; und/oder (ii) in die für das Polypeptid kodierende Nukleinsäure wenigstens eine Nukleinsäure inseriert wird, die für ein Oligopeptid kodiert, das die Aminosäuresequenz, ausgewählt aus SEQ ID No: 1 \nund\n 2, enthält und/oder (iii) wenigstens eine natürlicherweise in der für das Polypeptid kodierenden Nukleinsäure vorkommende Nukleinsäuresequenz durch eine Nukleinsäuresequenz substituiert wird, die für ein Oligopeptid kodiert, das eine Aminosäuresequenz enthält, die aus: SEQ ID No: 1 und SEQ ID No: 2 ausgewählt ist;\n \nb) Einklonieren der mutierten Nukleinsäure in einen geeigneten Expressionsvektor;\n \nc) Transformieren/Transfizieren einer geeigneten Wirtszelle mit dem erhaltenen Expressionsvektor;\n \nd) Kultivieren der transformierten/transfizierten Wirtszelle unter zur Expression geeigneten Bedingungen;\n \ne) Isolieren und gegebenenfalls Renaturieren der Expressionsprodukte.\n \n In a preferred form, the process comprises: \n \n a) \nin vitro\n mutagenesis of a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide, so that (i) at least one nucleic acid is added to the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide, which encodes an oligopeptide containing an amino acid sequence consisting of SEQ ID No: 1 and SEQ ID No: 2 is selected; and / or (ii) at least one nucleic acid encoding the nucleic acid sequence encoding an oligopeptide containing the amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID No: 1 and 2 is inserted into the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide and / or (iii) at least one naturally occurring in the nucleic acid sequence occurring for the polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid is substituted by a nucleic acid sequence encoding an oligopeptide containing an amino acid sequence selected from: SEQ ID No: 1 and SEQ ID No: 2; \n \n b) cloning in the mutated nucleic acid into a suitable expression vector; \n \n c) transforming / transfecting a suitable host cell with the obtained expression vector; \n \n d) cultivating the transformed / transfected host cell under conditions suitable for expression; \n \n e) Isolating and optionally renaturing the expression products. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDem Fachmann sind zahlreiche Verfahren zur Expression von DNA-Sequenzen bekannt; vgl. \n \nRecombinant Gene Expression Protocols in Methods in Molecular Biology, engl. Text, Band 62, Humana Press Totowa, New Jersey (1995\n \n). Die Expression kann sowohl konstitutiv als auch induzierbar sein, wobei Induktoren wie beispielsweise IPTG und Zn\n2+\n dem Fachmann bekannt sind.\nThe skilled worker is aware of numerous methods for the expression of DNA sequences; see. \n \n Recombinant Gene Expression Protocols in Methods in Molecular Biology, Engl. Text, Volume 62, Humana Press Totowa, New Jersey (1995 \n \n ). Expression may be both constitutive and inducible, with inducers such as IPTG and Zn \n2+ being\n known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie der Mutagenese zuzuführenden Nukleinsäuresequenzen, die für ein Polypeptid mit biologischer Aktivität kodieren, sind beispielsweise durch ein Screening von cDNA-Banken, die aus Gewebe hergestellt wurden, die das Polypeptid exprimieren, oder von genomischen DNA-Banken mit einer nachweisbar markierten spezifischen Sonde erhältlich. Die Identifizierung positiver cDNA-/genomischer DNA-Klone erfolgt gemäß Standardverfahren; vgl. \n \nManiatis et al., Molecular Cloning (1989), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press\n \n. Die Nukleinsäuresequenz, die für das Oligopeptid kodiert, das die erfindungsgemäße Aminosäuresequenz enthält, kann beispielsweise durch Kassetten-mutagenese oder durch rekombinante Polymerasekettenreaktion (PCR) in die doppelsträngige DNA eingefügt werden. Die entsprechenden Methoden sind dem Fachmann bekannt (z.B. Wang et al., 1997; Ruppert et al., 1996). Die erhaltene mutierte doppelsträngige DNA wird sodann in einen Expressionsvektor eingefügt.\nThe nucleic acid sequences to be delivered for mutagenesis which encode a polypeptide having biological activity are obtainable, for example, by screening cDNA libraries prepared from tissues expressing the polypeptide or genomic DNA libraries with a detectably labeled specific probe. The identification of positive cDNA / genomic DNA clones is done according to standard procedures; see. \n \n Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning (1989), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press \n \n , The nucleic acid sequence coding for the oligopeptide containing the amino acid sequence according to the invention can be inserted into the double-stranded DNA, for example by cassette mutagenesis or by recombinant polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The corresponding methods are known to the person skilled in the art (eg Wang et al., 1997; Ruppert et al., 1996). The resulting mutated double-stranded DNA is then inserted into an expression vector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie verwendbaren Vektoren und Wirtszellen wurden bereits vorstehend beschrieben. Wird die Expression in \nE. coli\n durchgeführt, so kann das Protein aus dem unlöslichen Anteil der Zellen durch Guanidiniumhydrochlorid herausgelöst werden (Ruppert et al., 1996). Sodann wird die Polypeptidvariante renaturiert und über Chromatographie gereinigt. Für die Reinigung von Proteinen aus der TGF-β Superfamilie ist ein pH-Wert von 8 bevorzugt, wobei bevorzugt bei hoher Salzkonzentration (1 M NaCl), in Gegenwart von schwachen Detergentien und mit Redoxmediatoren gearbeitet wird.\nThe useful vectors and host cells have already been described above. If the expression is carried out in \nE. coli\n , the protein can be dissolved out of the insoluble fraction of the cells by guanidinium hydrochloride (Ruppert et al., 1996). The polypeptide variant is then renatured and purified by chromatography. For the purification of proteins from the TGF-β superfamily, a pH of 8 is preferred, with preference being given to working at high salt concentration (1 M NaCl), in the presence of weak detergents and with redox mediators. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAlternativ kann die Polypeptidvariante aus dem Kulturmedium erhalten werden, wenn ein geeigneter Expressionsvektor verwendet wird, der zur Expression der Polypeptidvariante mit einer geeigneten sekretorischen Signalsequenz führt.\nAlternatively, the polypeptide variant can be obtained from the culture medium if a suitable expression vector is used which results in expression of the polypeptide variant with a suitable secretory signal sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie Erfindung stellt weiterhin pharmazeutische Zusammensetzungen bereit, die mindestens eine erfindungsgemäße Polypeptidvariante und physiologisch verträgliche Zusatzstoffe, die im Stand der Technik bekannt sind, enthalten. Bevorzugt ist hierbei, daß die Polypeptidvariante von einem biologisch aktiven Polypeptid abgeleitet ist, beispielsweise von einem Cytokin oder einem Wachstumsfaktor. Besonders bevorzugt sind hierbei Hormone, Cytokine und Wachstumsfaktoren, die an der Osteogenese beteiligt sind. Die erhöhte Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit der Polypeptidvarianten führte hierbei zu einer verringerten Diffusion der therapeutisch wirksamen Polypeptidvarianten von der Heparin-Komponente der demineralisierten Knochenmatrix und somit zu einer erhöhten lokalen Konzentration therapeutisch wirksamer Stoffe.\nThe invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one polypeptide variant of the invention and physiologically acceptable additives known in the art. It is preferred here that the polypeptide variant is derived from a biologically active polypeptide, for example from a cytokine or a growth factor. Especially preferred are hormones, cytokines and growth factors involved in osteogenesis. The increased heparin-binding ability of the polypeptide variants in this case led to a reduced diffusion of the therapeutically active polypeptide variants of the heparin component of the demineralized bone matrix and thus to an increased local concentration of therapeutically active substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAllgemein wurde auch eine erhöhte Bindungsfähigkeit für extrazelluläre Matrix-Strukturen und Zelloberflächen beobachtet. Die therapeutisch wirksamen Polypeptidvarianten sind somit verwendbar zur Vorbeugung und/oder Behandlung von Krankheiten, an denen die extrazelluläre Matrix oder Zelloberflächen beteiligt oder benachbart sind.\nIn general, increased binding ability has been observed for extracellular matrix structures and cell surfaces. The therapeutically effective polypeptide variants are thus useful for the prevention and / or treatment of diseases in which the extracellular matrix or cell surfaces are involved or adjacent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGehören die den Polypeptidvarianten zugrundeliegenden Polypeptide zur DVR-Familie, so sind sie zur Förderung des Knochenwachstums und -reparatur geeignet. Die Beteiligung von GDF-5 an der Knorpel-Bildung ist beschrieben und für die Sehnen-Entwicklung wird sie postuliert. Somit sind von GDF-5 abgeleiteten Polypeptidvarianten zur Knorpel- und Sehnen-Reparatur geeignet. BMP-7/OP-1 unterdrückt die Produktion von GDF-5, welches möglicherweise einen Mechanismus zum Ausgleich der Knochen- und Knorpel-Bildung darstellt. Somit weisen von BMP-7 abgeleiteten Polypeptidvarianten regulatorische Eigenschaften in bezug auf die Knochen- und Knorpel-Bildung auf.\nIf the polypeptides underlying the polypeptide variants belong to the DVR family, they are suitable for promoting bone growth and repair. The involvement of GDF-5 in cartilage formation is described and postulated for tendon development. Thus, GDF-5-derived polypeptide variants are useful for cartilage and tendon repair. BMP-7 / OP-1 suppresses the production of GDF-5, which may be a mechanism to balance bone and cartilage formation. Thus, BMP-7 derived polypeptide variants have bone and cartilage formation regulatory properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBMP-7 ist an der Nieren- und Augen-Entwicklung, BMP-6 an der Haut- und BMP-2 an der Herz-Entwicklung beteiligt. Somit können gemäß der vorliegenden Erfindung die von BMP abgeleiteten Polypeptidvarianten zur Regulation der Nieren-, Augen-, Haut- und Herz-Entwicklung verwendet werden.\nBMP-7 is involved in kidney and eye development, BMP-6 on the skin and BMP-2 in heart development. Thus, according to the present invention, those of  BMP-derived polypeptide variants can be used for the regulation of kidney, eye, skin and heart development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWeiterhin wird die Angiogenese durch GDF-5 induziert. Daher sind GDF-5 von abgeleiteten Polypeptidvarianten sinnvoll zur Stimulierung der Angiogenese einsetzbar.\nFurthermore, angiogenesis is induced by GDF-5. Therefore, GDF-5 of deduced polypeptide variants are useful for stimulating angiogenesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGehören die Polypeptide der Polypeptidvarianten zur TGF-β-Familie, so sind die therapeutisch wirksamen Polypeptidvarianten zur Immunsuppression, Entzündungshemmung, Stimulierung der Knochen- und Knorpel-Bildung geeignet. Sie sind aufgrund der verstärkten Ablagerung von Extrazellulärmatrix-Komponenten wie Collagenen, Fibronectin, Glykosaminoglykanen und Proteoglykanen zur Wundheilung verwendbar.\nIf the polypeptides of the polypeptide variants belong to the TGF-β family, then the therapeutically effective polypeptide variants are suitable for immunosuppression, anti-inflammatory, stimulation of bone and cartilage formation. They are useful for wound healing because of the increased deposition of extracellular matrix components such as collagens, fibronectin, glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWeiterhin sind die Polypeptidvarianten auf TGF-β-Basis zur Verhinderung der Retina-Ablösung verwendbar. Ferner sind sie vorteilhaft anwendbar bei oraler Mukositis, die als Nebenwirkung der Tumor-Chemotherapie auftritt. Aufgrund der allgemeinen Zellwachstumshemmung durch TGF-β's können sie zur Unterdrückung von Krebszellen wie beispielsweise Brustkrebszellen verwendet werden.\nFurthermore, the TGF-β-based polypeptide variants are useful for preventing retinal detachment. Furthermore, they are advantageously applicable to oral mucositis, which occurs as a side effect of tumor chemotherapy. Due to the general cell growth inhibition by TGF-β's, they can be used to suppress cancer cells such as breast cancer cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie Beteiligung der Hypophysen-Hormone, Aktivine und Inhibine bei der Modulation des weiblichen Menstruationszyklus ist bekannt. Aktivin induziert und Inhibin hemmt die Synthese der Hypophysen-Hormone FSH und LH. Somit wird die Verwendung der erfindungsgemäßen Polypeptidvarianten zur Regulation des weiblichen Menstruationszyklus vorgeschlagen.\nThe involvement of pituitary hormones, activins and inhibins in the modulation of the female menstrual cycle is known. Activin is induced and inhibin inhibits the synthesis of the pituitary hormones FSH and LH. Thus, the use of the polypeptide variants according to the invention for the regulation of the female menstrual cycle is proposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nInhibine unterdrücken die Entwicklung von Keimdrüsen-Tumoren. Inhibin-abgeleitete Polypeptidvarianten könnten daher bei der Prophylaxe und zur Behandlung von Keimdrüsen-Tumoren eingesetzt werden.\nInhibins suppress the development of gonadal tumors. Inhibin-derived polypeptide variants could therefore be used in the prophylaxis and treatment of gonadal tumors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAktivine sind vermutlich an der Wundheilung beteiligt. Die Erfindung umfaßt somit die Verwendung von von Aktivin abgeleiteten Polypeptidvarianten zur Herstellung von Medikamenten zur Wundheilung.\nActivins are thought to be involved in wound healing. The invention thus encompasses the use of activin-derived polypeptide variants for the preparation of wound healing medicaments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAktivine sind möglicherweise bei der Entwicklung und dem Umsatz von Knorpel zu Knochen beteiligt. Die von Aktivin abgeleiteten Polypeptidvarianten sind somit zur Regulation des Knochen- bzw. Knorpel-Wachstums geeignet.\nActivins may be involved in the development and turnover of cartilage to bone. The activin-derived polypeptide variants are thus suitable for the regulation of bone or cartilage growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAktivin fördert die Expansion von Blast-bildenden Untereinheiten und Kolonie-bildenden Untereinheiten während der Hämatopoese, wohingegen Inhibin diese Funktionen inhibiert. Daher wird die Verwendung von Polypeptidvarianten, die von diesen Proteinen abgeleitet sind, zur Regulation der Hämatopoese vorgeschlagen.\nActivin promotes the expansion of blast-forming subunits and colony-forming subunits during hematopoiesis, whereas inhibin inhibits these functions. Therefore, the use of polypeptide variants derived from these proteins is proposed for the regulation of hematopoiesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWeitere besonders relevante Polypeptide, die als Grundlage für die Polypeptidvarianten dienen können, sind MIS und GDNF (Glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor), die beide an der Embryonal-Entwicklung beteiligt sind.\nOther particularly relevant polypeptides that may serve as the basis for the polypeptide variants are MIS and Glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), both involved in embryonic development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn einer weiteren Ausführungsform stellt die Erfindung ferner eine Matrix zur Osteoinduktion bereit, die mindestens eine Polypeptidvariante und einen Träger umfaßt. Weiterhin wird ein \nin vitro\n-Verfahren zur Osteoinduktion, in dem die osteoinduktive Matrix verwendet wird, vorgeschlagen.\nIn a further embodiment, the invention further provides an osteoinduction matrix comprising at least one polypeptide variant and a carrier. Further, an \nin vitro\n method for osteoinduction in which the osteoinductive matrix is used is proposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIm Stand der Technik sind osteoinduktive Matrizen vorgeschlagen worden, die Wachstumsfaktoren enthalten. Beispielsweise befindet sich eine von der Firma Integra Life Sciences Corp. hergestellte Collagen-Matrix, die rekombinantes humanes BMP-2 umfaßt, in der Entwicklung (Hollinger et al., 1998). Weiterhin entwickelt die Firma Sofamor - Danek Titankäfige, die rekombinantes humanes BMP-2 enthalten. Schließlich gibt es eine Vorrichtung unter der Bezeichnung \"NOVOS™\" von der Firma Creative Biomolecules, nun als Weiterentwicklung durch die Firma Stryker bekannt, die osteoinduktives Typ I Knochencollagen und rekombinantes OP-1 (BMP-7) enthält. Diese Vorrichtung befindet sich in der klinischen Phase III in den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika. Die Verwendungen umfassen die Behandlung von orthopädischen Traumata, maxillofaziale Reparaturen und avaskuläre Nekrosen. Weiterhin wird die Verwendung von BMP-7 zur Behandlung von Knorpelschäden, Nierenversagen, Hirn- und Rückenmarksschädigungen, Herzinfarkt und Osteoporose vorgeschlagen.\nThe prior art has suggested osteoinductive matrices containing growth factors. For example, one from Integra Life Sciences Corp. is located. Collagen matrix comprising recombinant human BMP-2 is under development (Hollinger et al., 1998). Sofamor-Danek is also developing titanium cages containing recombinant human BMP-2. Finally, there is a device called \"NOVOS ™\" by the company Creative Biomolecules, now known as Advancement by the company Stryker, which contains osteoinductive type I bone collagen and recombinant OP-1 (BMP-7). This device is in Phase III clinical trials in the United States of America. Uses include the treatment of orthopedic trauma, maxillofacial repairs and avascular necrosis. Furthermore, the use of BMP-7 for the treatment of cartilage damage, kidney failure, brain and spinal cord damage, myocardial infarction and osteoporosis is proposed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTypischerweise wird also ein Matrix-Material mit osteoinduktiven Wachstumsfaktoren versetzt und diese Matrix operativ eingesetzt. Die Matrix ist hierbei nicht nur der Träger des Wachstumsfaktors, sondern verleiht auch physikalische Stabilität und verhindert das Eindringen von Weichteilgewebe in den Ort des Knochendefektes. Das Hinzufügen der Wachstumsfaktoren soll hierbei das Ersetzen des Implantates durch neuen Knochen beschleunigen.\nTypically, therefore, a matrix material is mixed with osteoinductive growth factors and this matrix is used operationally. The matrix is not only the carrier of the growth factor, but also gives physical stability and prevents the penetration of soft tissue into the site of the bone defect. The addition of growth factors in this case accelerate the replacement of the implant by new bone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEin Hauptproblem bei den bekannten Matrix-Typen besteht jedoch darin, daß die in der Matrix enthaltenen Proteine sehr rasch den Ort der Anwendung verlassen. Da die Knochenreparatur jedoch ein relativ langsamer Vorgang auch bei Anwesenheit von Wachstumsfaktoren ist, wirkt die kurze Verbleibzeit des hinzugefügten Proteins limitierend.\nHowever, a major problem with the known matrix types is that the proteins contained in the matrix leave the site of application very rapidly. However, since bone repair is a relatively slow process even in the presence of growth factors, the short retention time of the added protein has a limiting effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDa die biologische Wirkung von osteoinduktiven Wachstumsfaktoren darin besteht, die Immigration von pluripotenten mesenchymalen Zellen unter Bildung von Chondro- und Osteovorläuferzellen zu induzieren und deren Aktivität zu stimulieren, erfordert dies die Lokalisierung der Wachstumsfaktoren an der Reparaturstelle. Wachstumsfaktoren, die aus der Reparaturstelle herausdiffundieren, sind einerseits für die beabsichtigte therapeutische Wirkung sinnlos und bergen andererseits die Gefahr einer ektopischen Knochenbildung.\nSince the biological effect of osteoinductive growth factors is to induce the immigration of pluripotent mesenchymal cells to form chondro and osteo progenitor cells and to stimulate their activity, this requires localization of growth factors at the repair site. On the one hand, growth factors that diffuse out of the repair site are meaningless for the intended therapeutic effect and on the other hand harbor the risk of ectopic bone formation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie erfindungsgemäßen Polypeptidvarianten zeichnen sich im Vergleich mit den bekannten Polypeptiden durch eine erhöhte Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit aus, die bei Verwendung von Heparin bzw. Heparin-ähnlichen Strukturen als Matrixmaterial oder auf die Matrix aufgebrachtes Material das rasche Wegdiffundieren der Polypeptidvarianten vom Träger verhindert. Die Polypeptidvarianten bleiben somit am Ort der Wirkung lokalisiert. In einer bevorzugten Ausführungsform besteht der Träger aus Heparin, Hydroxylapatit, Hyaluronsäure, synthetischen Polymeren oder Collagen. Die Trägerstoffe können resorbierbar oder nicht resorbierbar sein.\nThe polypeptide variants of the invention are distinguished in comparison with the known polypeptides by an increased heparin-binding ability, which prevents the rapid diffusion away of the polypeptide variants from the carrier when using heparin or heparin-like structures as a matrix material or on the matrix applied material. The polypeptide variants thus remain localized at the site of action. In a preferred embodiment, the carrier is heparin, hydroxyapatite, hyaluronic acid, synthetic polymers or collagen. The carriers may be resorbable or non-absorbable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIm Stand der Technik sind verschiedene Verfahren zum Herstellen von pharmazeutisch verträglichen Matrizen bekannt. Beispiele pharmazeutisch verträglicher Matrizen sind in Wagner et al., 1996, und Fischgrund et al., 1997 beschrieben. Die Matrix kann in Form eines Blockes, Gels, Vlies, einer Kugel oder Granula ausgebildet sein.\nVarious methods of making pharmaceutically acceptable matrices are known in the art. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable matrices are in  Wagner et al., 1996, and Fischgrund et al., 1997. The matrix may be in the form of a block, gel, fleece, a ball or granules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie Verteilung der Polypeptidvarianten Innerhalb der Matrix kann homogen oder nichthomogen sein, wobei eine homogene Verteilung bevorzugt ist Die Verteilung der Polypeptidvariante kann, abhängig von der Größe des Defektes oder der Dauer des Heilungsvorgangs, vorteilhaft gestaltet werden. Die Polypeptidvariante sollte hierbei in einer Konzentration von ungefähr 100 µg/cm\n3\n bis ungefähr 2 mg/cm\n3\n, vorzugsweise 250 µg/cm\n3\n bis 750 µg/cm\n3\n und besonders bevorzugt 450 µg/cm\n3\n bis 550 µg/cm\n3\n Träger liegen. In der Regel wird eine Konzentration von ungefähr 500 µg/cm\n3\n verwendet werden.\nThe Distribution of the Polypeptide Variants Within the matrix may be homogeneous or non-homogeneous, with a homogeneous distribution being preferred. The distribution of the polypeptide variant may be advantageously designed, depending on the size of the defect or the duration of the healing process. The polypeptide variant should in this case be in a concentration of about 100 μg / cm \n3\n to about 2 mg / cm \n3\n , preferably 250 μg / cm \n3\n to 750 μg / cm \n3\n and particularly preferably 450 μg / cm \n3\n to 550 μg / cm \n3\n carrier , As a rule, a concentration of approximately 500 μg / cm \n3\n will be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nErfindungsgemäß kann die osteolnduktive Matrix zur Behandlung von orthopädischen Traumata, maxillofaszlalen Reparaturen und avaskulären Nekrosen verwendet werden. Weiterhin wird die Verwendung zur Prophylaxe und Therapie von Knorpelschäden, Nierenversagen, Hirn- und Rückenmarksschädigungen, Herzinfarkt und Osteoporose vorgeschlagen.\nAccording to the invention, the osteoluminescent matrix can be used to treat orthopedic trauma, maxillofacial repair and avascular necrosis. Furthermore, the use for the prophylaxis and therapy of cartilage damage, kidney failure, brain and spinal cord damage, myocardial infarction and osteoporosis is proposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGegenstand der Erfindung ist die Verwendung einer Polypeptidvariante gemäss der Erfindung, zur Herstellung einer pharmazeutischen Zusammensetzung zur Stimulation der Osteogenese oder Wundheilung, oder zur Behandlung von Entzündung oder Krebs, wobei das as BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6, BMP-7/OP-1 und BMP-8/OP-2 ausgewählte Polpeptid durch Addition, Substitution, Insertion, Inversion und/oder Deletion verändert ist, wobei das durch Addition, Substitution, Insertion, Inversion und/oder Deletion veränderte Polpeptid im wesentlichen die gleiche Rezeptorbindungsaffinität zu der Ektodomäne von BNPR-IA wie BMP-2 aufweist und mindestens 50% homolog dazu ist und wobei die Variante die Sequenz der SEQ ID NR: 3 oder 4 umfasst. Bevorzugt ist das obige Polypeptid mindestens 90% homolog zu BMP-2.\nThe invention relates to the use of a polypeptide variant according to the invention, for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for stimulating osteogenesis or wound healing, or for the treatment of inflammation or cancer, wherein the BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6 , BMP-7 / OP-1 and BMP-8 / OP-2 selected polypeptide is modified by addition, substitution, insertion, inversion and / or deletion, wherein the modified by addition, substitution, insertion, inversion and / or deletion Polpeptid in has substantially the same receptor binding affinity to the ectodomain of BNPR-IA as BMP-2 and is at least 50% homologous thereto and wherein the variant comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3 or 4. Preferably, the above polypeptide is at least 90% homologous to BMP-2. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie erfindungsgemäße osteoinduktive Matrix weist bei Verwendung rekombinant hergetellter Polypeptidvarianten weiterhin den Vorteil auf, daß sie frei von Kontaminationen, z. B. Viren ist, die bei Wachstumsfaktoren tierischer Herkunft von Zeit zu Zeit beobachtet werden.\nThe osteoinductive matrix according to the invention, when using recombinantly prepared polypeptide variants, furthermore has the advantage that it is free of contaminants, eg. B. is viruses that are observed in growth factors of animal origin from time to time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie erfindungsgemäße osteoinduktive Matrix kann \nin vitro\n verwendet werden, um in Gewebekultur die Ansiedlung von Osteoblasten und/oder Chondroblasten zu ermöglichen. Diese so vorbereiteten osteoinduktiven Matrizen können sodann autolog oder heterolog mit chirurgischen Verfahren in Patienten eingebracht werden (Kübler et al., 1997; Kübler et al., 1998; Chen et al., 1998).\nThe osteoinductive matrix of the present invention can be used \nin vitro\n to allow tissue culture to colonize osteoblasts and / or chondroblasts. These osteoinductive matrices prepared in this way can then be introduced autologously or heterologously into patients by surgical procedures (Kübler et al., 1997, Kübler et al., 1998, Chen et al., 1998).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEs ist beabsichtigt, mit den nachfolgenden Figuren und Beispielen die Erfindung zu erläutern, diese jedoch in keiner Weise einzuschränken. Dem Fachmann sind aufgrund der Beschreibung und der Beispiele weitere Ausführungsformen zugänglich, die ebenfalls umfaßt sind.\nIt is intended to explain the invention with the following figures and examples, but to limit them in any way. The skilled person will be able to access other embodiments based on the description and the examples, which are also included. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBeschreibung der Figuren:\nDescription of the figures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \nFig. 1\n zeigt Abbildungen einiger Strukturformeln von typischen Disaccharideinheiten Heparin-ähnlicher Strukturen, wie sie unter anderem in bestimmten Glykosaminoglykanen auftreten.\n \n Fig. 1 \n shows illustrations of some structural formulas of typical disaccharide units of heparin-like structures, as they occur, inter alia, in certain glycosaminoglycans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nFig. 2\n zeigt das Bild eines mit Coomassie Blau angefärbten SDS-Polyacrylamidgels nach Auftrennung der in \nE. coli\n exprimierten und gereinigten Varianten T3 und T4 sowie von BMP-2 und EHBMP-2 in oxidierter (oben) und reduzierter (unten) Form.

Die Präparate wurden mit Hematoxylin-Eosin gefärbt. Ossikel erscheinen violett, mit darin eingeschlossenen weissen oder dunkelvioletten Arealen. Bei den dunkelvioletten Bereichen handelt es sich um Knochenmark, bei den weissen Zellen um Fettgewebe, das natürlicherweise im Knochenmark vorkommt. Die umgebende Muskulatur ist intensiv rot gefärbt.\n \n Fig. 7a and 7b \n show histological views of mouse-formed ossicles induced by implantation of BMP-2. The preparations were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Ossicles appear purple, with white or dark purple areas enclosed.

Die Bindung von Polypeptiden und erfindungsgemäßen Polypeptidvarianten mit erhöhter Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit an den Heparin-dotierten Biosensor wurde mit Hilfe eines BIA2000 Gerätes gemessen. Die einzelnen Versuchsbedingungen sind vorbeschrieben (Ruppert et al., 1996).\nHeparin 6000 was aminobiotinylated to measure heparin binding (Mach et al., 1993) and fixed to a streptavidin-coated biosensor CM5 (Pharmacia Biosensor AB). The binding of polypeptides and polypeptide variants according to the invention with increased heparin-binding ability to the heparin-doped biosensor was measured by means of a BIA2000 device. The individual experimental conditions are described above (Ruppert et al., 1996).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMessung der Bindung an den Rezeptor BMPR-IA\nMeasurement of binding to the receptor BMPR-IA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nZur Messung der Bindung wurde die Ektodomäne des Rezeptors BMPR-IA aminobiotinyliert (Shen et al., 1996) und an einen Streptavidin-beschichteten Biosensor CM5 (Pharmacia Biosensor AB) fixiert. Die Bindung von Polypeptiden und den erfindungsgemäßen Polypeptidvarianten an den Rezeptor-dotierten Biosensor wurde mit Hilfe eines BIA2000 Gerätes gemessen.\nTo measure binding, the ectodomain of the BMPR-IA receptor was aminobiotinylated (Shen et al., 1996) and a streptavidin-coated biosensor CM5  (Pharmacia Biosensor AB) fixed. The binding of polypeptides and the polypeptide variants according to the invention to the receptor-doped biosensor was measured by means of a BIA2000 device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMessung der biologischen Osteoinduktions-Aktivität\nMeasurement of biological osteoinduction activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nZur Messung der biologischen Aktivität wurde folgendes Zellkultursystem verwendet: Zellen aus den Gliedmaßenknospen von Hühnerembryonen wurden isoliert und für die Messung des BMP-abhängigen Einbaus von \n35\nSO\n4\n in Proteoglykane verwendet (Ruppert et al., 1996). Es wurde ein Konzentrationsbereich für das BMP-Protein gewählt, der es ermöglichte, sowohl die maximale Zellantwort als auch die EC\n50\n-Konzentration (Konzentration, bei der 50 % des maximalen Einbaus erreicht werden) zu bestimmen.\nTo measure biological activity, the following cell culture system was used: chicken embryo limb bud cells were isolated and used to measure BMP-dependent incorporation of \n35\n SO \n4\n into proteoglycans (Ruppert et al., 1996). A concentration range for the BMP protein was chosen that allowed to determine both the maximal cell response and the EC \n50\n concentration (concentration at which 50% of maximum incorporation is achieved).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie myoblastäre Maus-Zellinie C2C12 wurde verwendet, um die BMP-abhängige Induktion der Alkalischen Phosphatase zu bestimmen (Katagiri et al., 1994). Es konnten die maximale Zellantwort und die EC\n50\n-Konzentration bestimmt werden.\nThe mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 was used to determine the BMP-dependent induction of alkaline phosphatase (Katagiri et al., 1994). The maximum cell response and the EC \n50\n concentration could be determined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBeispiel 1: Expression und Charakterisierung von T3\nExample 1: Expression and Characterization of T3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEs wurde cDNA (Ruppert et al., 1996), die für das reife humane BMP-2 (NIH-Datenbank Entrez/Swiss-Prot Nr. P12643) und zusätzlich ATGGCT (Met-Ala) am 5' Ende kodierte, einer Kassetten-Mutagenese (Wang et al., 1997) unterworfen. Zwischen die singulären Spaltstellen für \nNco\nI und \nAfl\nII wurde folgende doppelsträngige DNA eingefügt:\n\n \n5' CATGGCTCAAGCCAAACACAAACAGCGGAAACGCGCTCGTAAACGTC 3' SEQ ID NO: 9\n \n3' CGAGTTCGGTTTGTGTTTGTCGCCTrPGCGCGCGCATTTGCAGAATT 5 SEQ ID NO: 10\n \n CDNA (Ruppert et al., 1996) coding for mature human BMP-2 (NIH database Entrez / Swiss-Prot No. P12643) and additionally ATGGCT (Met-Ala) at the 5 'end of a cassette Mutagenesis (Wang et al., 1997). Between the singular cleavage sites for \nNco\n I and \nAfl\n II, the following double-stranded DNA was inserted: \n \n 5 'CATGGCTCAAGCCAAACACAAACAGCGGAAACGCGCTCGTAAACGTC 3' SEQ ID NO: 9 \n \n 3 'CGAGTTCGGTTTGTGTTTGTCGCCTrPGCGCGCGCATTTGCAGAATT 5 SEQ ID NO: 10 \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDadurch wurde zwischen Gln an Position 8 und Arg an Position 9 eines humanen Met-Ala-BMP-2 zusätzlich die Sequenz Arg-Lys-Arg-Ala (SEQ ID No. 3) eingefügt. Die mutierte cDNA wurde als \nNco\nI/\nBam\nHI-Fragment in den Expressionsvektor pRBSIIP\nN25\nx/o (Stueber et al., 1984) integriert, und die Mutation durch Sequenzierung bestätigt.\nThis additionally inserted the sequence Arg-Lys-Arg-Ala (SEQ ID No. 3) between Gln at position 8 and Arg at position 9 of a human Met-Ala-BMP-2. The mutated cDNA was integrated as a \nNco\n I / \nBam\n HI fragment into the expression vector pRBSIIP \nN25\n x / o (Stueber et al., 1984) and the mutation confirmed by sequencing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNach Expression und Isolierung zeigte sich, daß die so hergestellte Variante T3 in der SDS-Polyacrylamid-Gelelektrophorese (SDS-PAGE) ein im Vergleich zu BMP-2 erwartungsgemäß höheres apparentes Molekulargewicht aufwies. T3 interagierte in Biosensor Experimenten (BIA2000) mit unveränderter Affinität (Dissoziationskonstante K\nd\n: ca. 200 pM) mit der Ektodomäne des BMP-Rezeptors BMPR-IA (NIH-Datenbank Entrez/Swiss-Prot Nr. P36894). Die Bindung an Heparin war jedoch im Vergleich zu BMP-2 erhöht, wohingegen die Abdissoziierung verlangsamt war.\nAfter expression and isolation, it was found that the T3 variant prepared in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) had an expected higher apparent molecular weight compared to BMP-2. T3 interacted with biosensor experiments (BIA2000) with unchanged affinity (dissociation constant K \nd\n : ca. 200 pM) with the ectodomain of the BMP receptor BMPR-IA (NIH database Entrez / Swiss-Prot No. P36894). The binding to heparin, however, was increased compared to BMP-2, whereas the dissociation was slowed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie biologische Aktivität war in verschiedenen Testsystemen verändert. Die über einen Sulfateinbau gemessene Proteoglykansynthese in Zellen der Gliedmaßenknospen von Hühnerembryonen zeigte einen höheren EC\n50\n-Wert für T3 im Vergleich zu BMP-2. Der maximal erreichbare Einbau war unverändert. Die Induktion der Alkalischen Phosphatase-Aktivität in der C2C12-Zellinie zeigte für T3 ebenfalls einen höheren EC\n50\n-Wert als für BMP-2.\nThe biological activity was altered in different test systems. The proteoglycan synthesis as measured by sulfate incorporation in chick embryo limb bud cells showed a higher EC \n50\n for T3 compared to BMP-2. The maximum achievable installation was unchanged. The induction of alkaline phosphatase activity in the C2C12 cell line also showed a higher EC \n50\n value for T3 than for BMP-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBeispiel 2: Expression und Charakterisierung von T4\nExample 2: Expression and Characterization of T4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEs wurde Beispiel 1 mit der Ausnahme wiederholt, daß folgende doppelsträngige DNA in die BMP-2 cDNA integriert wurde:\n\n \nExample 1 was repeated except that the following double-stranded DNA was integrated into the BMP-2 cDNA: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie obere Sequenz wird mit SEQ ID NO: 11, die untere mit SEQ ID NO: 12 im Sequenzprotokoll angegeben.\nThe upper sequence is indicated by SEQ ID NO: 11, the lower one by SEQ ID NO: 12 in the Sequence Listing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDadurch wurde zwischen Gin an Position 8 und Arg an Position 9 des BMP-2 zusätzlich die Sequenz Arg-Lys-Arg-Ala-Lys-His-Lys-Gln eingefügt.\nThis additionally inserted the sequence Arg-Lys-Arg-Ala-Lys-His-Lys-Gln between Gin at position 8 and Arg at position 9 of BMP-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie so exprimierte und isolierte Variante T4 wies in der SDS-PAGE ein höheres apparentes Molekulargewicht als T3 und BMP-2 auf. T4 bindet an die Ektodomäne des BMP-Rezeptors BMPR-IA mit einer Dissoziationskonstante von etwa 340 pM. Dies entspricht der Rezeptor-Affinität von BMP-2 (K\nd\n 320 pM). Die Bindung von T4 an Heparin war jedoch im Vergleich zu BMP-2 erhöht, und die Abdissoziierung verlangsamt. Die Freisetzung von T4 von Heparin war überraschenderweise langsamer als die von T3.\nThe thus expressed and isolated variant T4 had a higher apparent molecular weight in SDS-PAGE than T3 and BMP-2. T4 binds to the ectodomain of the BMP receptor  BMPR-IA with a dissociation constant of about 340 pM. This corresponds to the receptor affinity of BMP-2 (K \nd\n 320 pM). However, the binding of T4 to heparin was increased compared to BMP-2, and the dissociation slowed. The release of T4 from heparin was surprisingly slower than that of T3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie biologische Aktivität von T4 ist im Vergleich zu BMP-2 verändert. T4 zeigt während der Proteoglykansynthese (Sulfateinbau) in Zellen von Gliedmaßenknospen von Hühnerembryonen einen höheren EC\n50\n-Wert als BMP-2 (und sogar höher als T3). Ebenso wird die Aktivität der Alkalischen Phosphatase in C2C12-Zellen durch T4 bei einem höheren EC\n50\n-Wert induziert als durch BMP-2.\nThe biological activity of T4 is altered compared to BMP-2. T4 shows a higher EC \n50\n value than BMP-2 (and even higher than T3) during proteoglycan synthesis (sulfate incorporation) in chicken embryo limb bud cells. Similarly, the activity of alkaline phosphatase in C2C12 cells is induced by T4 at a higher EC \n50\n than by BMP-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBeispiel 3: Untersuchungen zur \nin vivo\n-Wirksamkeit der Polypeptidvarianten\nExample 3: \nIn vivo\n efficacy studies of polypeptide variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAls Methode wurde hierbei die Induktion von ektotopem Knochen im Oberschenkelmuskel der Maus gewählt. Bei ektoper Knochenbildung entsteht Knochen \nde novo\n in einem fremden Gewebe und ohne Kontakt zum Skelettsystem. Der Vorteil dieses Testsystems liegt in seiner hohen Stringenz. Da kein Kontakt mit skelettalem Knochen existiert, spielen regenerative Knochenheilungsprozesse keine Rolle. Somit werden falsch positive Versuchsergebnisse vermieden, die durch Verletzung des Knochens während der Operation verursacht werden könnten.\nAs a method, the induction of ectotopic bone in the thigh muscle of the mouse was chosen. In ectopic bone formation, bone is created \nde novo\n in a foreign tissue and without contact with the skeletal system. The advantage of this test system lies in its high stringency. Since there is no contact with skeletal bone, regenerative bone healing processes are irrelevant. This avoids false positive test results that could be caused by injury to the bone during surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie Methode zur Induktion ektoper Knochenbildung in ICR-Mäusen ist im Detail beschrieben in Kübler und Urist, 1991.\nThe method for inducing ectopic bone formation in ICR mice is described in detail in Kübler and Urist, 1991.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBMP-2 und die Variante T3 wurden in unterschiedlichen Konzentrationen mit Rinderserumalbumin als Träger vermischt, und in den Musculus quadriceps femoris von ICR-Mäusen implantiert. Nach 3 Wochen wurde das gebildete Knochenmaterial durch Röntgenaufnahmen und histologische Untersuchungen charakterisiert.\nBMP-2 and variant T3 were mixed in different concentrations with bovine serum albumin as carrier and implanted in the quadriceps femoris muscle of ICR mice. After 3 weeks, the formed bone material was characterized by X-ray and histological examination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie Implantation von Rinderserumalbumin ohne BMP (Kontrolle) ergab in keinem Fall nachweisbare Knochenbildung. Weder mit BMP-2 noch mit T3 wurden Anzeichen für eine Entzündung oder sonstige schädliche Nebenwirkungen beobachtet. \nFig. 7\n ist zu entnehmen, daß BMP-2 die Bildung von Knochenmatrix und Knochenmark induzieren konnte. \nFig. 8\n zeigt die entsprechende Abbildung für die Behandlung mit T3. Im Vergleich zum Ergebnis mit BMP-2 zeigt sich für T3, daß das Verhältnis von Knochenmatrix zu Knochenmark stark in Richtung eines hohen Anteils von Knochenmatrix verschoben ist.\nThe implantation of bovine serum albumin without BMP (control) did not give any detectable bone formation. Neither BMP-2 nor T3 showed any signs of inflammation or other harmful side effects. \n Fig. 7 \n is to  suggest that BMP-2 was able to induce bone matrix and bone marrow formation. \n Fig. 8 \n shows the corresponding figure for treatment with T3. Compared to the result with BMP-2, T3 shows that the ratio of bone matrix to bone marrow is strongly shifted towards a high proportion of bone matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nFig. 9\n zeigt eine Röntgenaufnahme eines durch T3 Implantation gebildeten Ossikels. Die Größe des Ossikels unterscheidet sich nicht wesentlich von Ossikeln, die im gleichen Testsystem mit konventionellen BMPs erhalten wurden.\n \n Fig. 9 \n shows an x-ray of an ossicle formed by T3 implantation. The size of the ossicle is not significantly different from ossicles obtained in the same test system with conventional BMPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nFig. 10\n zeigt die histologische Ansicht eines Ossikels, das durch Behandlung mit T3 induziert wurde. Die Färbung wurde hier mit Masson-Trichrome durchgeführt, was es erlaubt, den Differenzierungsstatus von Knochengewebe zu unterscheiden. Rote Farbe zeigt komplett ausdifferenzierten Knochen an, türkise Areale sind noch im Prozess der Ossifikation begriffen. Zum Teil können in dem türkis gefärbten Gewebe runde, weisse Zellen ausgemacht werden; es handelt sich dabei um Restanteile von knorpelbildenden Chondrocyten, da die BMP-induzierte Knochenbildung durch endochondrale Ossifikation erfolgt (transiente Knorpelbildung).\n \n Fig. 10 \n shows the histological view of an ossicle induced by treatment with T3. The staining was done here with Masson-Trichrome, which allows to differentiate the differentiation status of bone tissue. Red color indicates completely differentiated bones, turquoise areas are still in the process of ossification. In part, round, white cells can be identified in the turquoise-colored tissue; these are residual parts of cartilage-forming chondrocytes, since BMP-induced bone formation takes place by endochondral ossification (transient cartilage formation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie den \nFiguren 7 bis 10\n zugrundeliegenden Versuche werden mit jeweils 10 µg rekombinantem humanem BMP-2 bzw. rekombinanten T3 (SEQ ID No. 5) durchgeführt. In der folgenden Tabelle wird die \nin vivo\n Wirksamkeit von BMP-2 und rekombinantem T3 verglichen.\n\n \nTabelle 1: Vergleich der durch BMP-2 bzw.

Bei Implantation von 1 µg BMP-2 erfolgte in keinem von neun Versuchen Knochenbildung, wohingegen bei der gleichen Menge T3 in vier von vier implantierten Tieren Knochen gebildet wurde. T3 induziert sogar bei Applikation von nur 0,4 µg noch in 3 von 4 Tieren Knochenbildung.\nIt turns out that T3 is more effective at low concentrations than BMP-2 (Table 1). When 1 μg BMP-2 was implanted, bone formation did not occur in any of nine experiments, whereas bone was produced in four out of four implanted animals at the same level of T3. T3 even induces bone formation in 3 of 4 animals even when only 0.4 μg is applied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie Ergebnisse zeigen, daß die Polypeptidvariante mit erhöhter Heparin-Bindungsfähigkeit \nin vivo\n die Knochenbildung induzieren kann. Es wurden in keinem Fall Entzündungsreaktionen oder sonstige Unverträglichkeiten beobachtet. Im Vergleich zu konventionellem BMP-2 bewirkt die Anwendung von T3 die Bildung eines Ossikels mit wesentlich höherem Anteil an Knochenmatrix. Da die Matrix dem Knochen seine mechanische Stabilität verleiht, wird ein in diesem Sinne dichterer Knochen eine wesentlich höhere Festigkeit und funktionelle Belastbarkeit aufweisen. Es wird also im Vergleich zu BMP-2 die Bildung eines Knochens mit deutlich höherer Qualität induziert. Da T3 bei einer geringeren Konzentration als BMP-2 \nin vivo\n biologische Wirksamkeit zeigt, kann auch die erforderliche Menge an Wachstumsfaktor reduziert werden. Dies stellt einen wünschenswerten Vorteil der Polypeptidvariante im Vergleich zu BMP-2 dar.\nThe results show that the polypeptide variant with increased heparin-binding ability \nin vivo\n can induce bone formation. In no case were inflammatory reactions or other incompatibilities observed. Compared to conventional BMP-2, the use of T3 causes the formation of an ossicle with a significantly higher proportion of bone matrix. Since the matrix gives the bone its mechanical stability, a denser bone in this sense will have a much higher strength and functional capacity. Thus, in comparison to BMP-2, the formation of a bone with significantly higher quality is induced. Since T3 shows biological efficacy at a lower concentration than BMP-2 \nin vivo\n , the required amount of growth factor can also be reduced. This represents a desirable advantage of the polypeptide variant as compared to BMP-2. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLiteraturliste\nBibliography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAltschul et al., J.

    "text": "Packaging of immunostimulatory substances into virus-like particles: method of preparation and use AbstractThe invention relates to the finding that virus like particles (VLPs) can be loaded with immunostimulatory substances, in particular with DNA oligonucleotides containing non-methylated C and G (CpGs). Such CpG- VLPs are dramatically more immunogenic than their CpG-free counterparts and induce enhanced B and T cell responses. The immune response against antigens optionally coupled, fused or attached otherwise to the VLPs is similarly enhanced as the immune response against the VLP itself. In addition, the T cell responses against both the VLPs and antigens are especially directed to the Thl type. Antigens attached to CpG-loaded VLPs may therefore be ...

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is related to the fields of vaccinology, immunology and medicine. The invention provides compositions and methods for enhancing immunological responses against virus-like particles (VLPs) or against antigens coupled, fused or attached otherwise to VLPs by packaging immunostimulatory substances, in particular immunostimulatory nucleic acids, and even more particular oligonucleotides containing at least one non-methylated CpG sequence, into the VLPs. The invention can be used to induce strong and sustained T cell responses particularly useful for the treatment of tumors and chronic viral diseases as well as allergies and other chronic diseases.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRelated Art\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe essence of the immune system is built on two separate foundation pillars: one is specific or adaptive immunity which is characterized by relatively slow response-kinetics and the ability to remember; the other is non-specific or innate immunity exhibiting rapid response-kinetics but lacking memory. Lymphocytes are the key players of the adaptive immune system. Each lymphocyte expresses antigen-receptors of unique specificity. Upon recognizing an antigen via the receptor, lymphocytes proliferate and develop effector function. Few lymphocytes exhibit specificity for a given antigen or pathogen, and massive proliferation is usually required before an effector response can be measured - hence, the slow kinetics of the adaptive immune system. Since a significant proportion of the expanded lymphocytes survive and may maintain some effector function following elimination of the antigen, the adaptive immune system reacts faster when encountering the antigen a second time. This is the basis of its ability to remember.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast to the situation with lymphocytes, where specificity for a pathogen is confined to few cells that must expand to gain function, the cells and molecules of the innate immune system are usually present in massive numbers and recognize a limited number of invariant features associated with pathogens (\nMedzhitov, R. and Janeway, C.A., Jr., Cell 91:295-298 (1997\n)). Examples of such patterns include lipopolysaccharides (LPS), non-methylated CG-rich DNA (CpG) or double stranded RNA, which are specific for bacterial and viral infections, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost research in immunology has focused on the adaptive immune system and only recently has the innate immune system entered the focus of interest. Historically, the adaptive and innate immune system were treated and analyzed as two separate entities that had little in common. Such was the disparity that few researchers wondered why antigens were much more immunogenic for the specific immune system when applied with adjuvants that stimulated innate immunity (\nSotomayor, E. M., et al., Nat. Med. 5:780 (1999\n); \nDiehl, L., et al., Nat. Med 5:774 (1999\n); \nWeigle, W. O., Adv. Immunol. 30:159 (1980\n)). However, the answer posed by this question is critical to the understanding of the immune system and for comprehending the balance between protective immunity and autoimmunity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRationalized manipulation of the innate immune system and in particular activation of APCs involved in T cell priming to deliberately induce a self-specific T cell response provides a means for T cell-based tumor-therapy. Accordingly, the focus of most current therapies is on the use of activated dendritic cells (DCs) as antigen-carriers for the induction of sustained T cell responses (\nNestle et al., Nat. Med. 4:328 (1998\n)). Similarly, in vivo activators of the innate immune system, such as CpGs or anti-CD40 antibodies, are applied together with tumor cells in order to enhance their immunogenicity (\nSotomayor, E. M., et al., Nat. Med 5:780 (1999\n); \nDiehl, L., et al., Nat. Med 5:774 (1999\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeneralized activation of APCs by factors that stimulate innate immunity may often be the cause for triggering self-specific lymphocytes and autoimmunity. Activation may result in enhanced expression of costimulatory molecules or cytokines such as IL-12 or IFNα. This view is compatible with the observation that administration of LPS together with thyroid extracts is able to overcome tolerance and trigger autoimmune thyroiditis (\nWeigle, W. O., Adv. Immunol. 30:159 (1980\n)). Moreover, in a transgenic mouse model, it was recently shown that administration of self-peptide alone failed to cause auto-immunity unless APCs were activated by a separate pathway (\nGarza, K. M., et al., J. Exp. Med. 191:2021 (2000\n)). The link between innate immunity and autoimmune disease is further underscored by the observation that LPS, viral infections or generalized activation of APCs delays or prevents the establishment of peripheral tolerance (\nVella, A. T., et al., Immunity 2:261 (1995\n); \nEhl, S., et aL, J. Exp. Med. 187:763 (1998\n); \nMaxwell, J. R., et al., J. Immunol. 162:2024 (1999\n)). In this way, innate immunity not only enhances the activation of self-specific lymphocytes but also inhibits their subsequent elimination. These findings may extend to tumor biology and the control of chronic viral diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInduction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses after immunization with minor histocompatibility antigens, such as the HY-antigen, requires the presence of T helper cells (Th cells) (\nHusmann, L. A., and M. J. Bevan, Ann. NY. Acad. Sci. 532:158 (1988\n); \nGuerder, S., and P. Matzinger, J. Exp. Med. 176:553 (1992\n)). CTL-responses induced by cross-priming, \ni.e.\n by priming with exogenous antigens that reached the class I pathway, have also been shown to require the presence of Th cells (\nBennett, S. R M., et al., J. Exp. Med. 186:65 (1997\n)). These observations have important consequences for tumor therapy where T help may be critical for the induction of protective CTL responses by tumor cells (\nOssendorp, F., et al., J. Exp. Med. 187:693 (1998\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn important effector molecule on activated Th cells is the CD40-ligand (CD40L) interacting with CD40 on B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) (\nFoy, T.M., et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 14:591 (1996\n)). Triggering of CD40 on B cells is essential for isotype switching and the generation of B cell memory (\nFoy, T. M., et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol. 14:591 (1996\n)). More recently, it was shown that stimulation of CD40 on macrophages and DCs leads to their activation and maturation (\nCella, M., et al., Curr. Opin. Immunol. 9:10 (1997\n); \nBanchereau, J., and R M. Steinman Nature 392:245 (1998\n)). Specifically, DCs upregulate costimulatory molecules and produce cytokines such as IL-12 upon activation. Interestingly, this CD40L-mediated maturation of DCs seems to be responsible for the helper effect on CTL responses. In fact, it has recently been shown that CD40-triggering by Th cells renders DCs able to initiate a CTL-response (\nRidge, J. P., et al., Nature 393:474 (1998\n); \nBennett, S. R. M., et al., Nature 393:478 (1998\n); \nSchoenenberger, S. P., et al., Nature 393:480 (1998\n)). This is consistent with the earlier observation that Th cells have to recognize their ligands on the same APC as the CTLs, indicating that a cognate interaction is required (\nBennett, S. R. M., et al., J. Exp. Med. 186:65 (1997\n)). Thus CD40L-mediated stimulation by Th cells leads to the activation of DCs, which subsequently are able to prime CTL-responses. In the human, type I interferons, in particular interferon α and β may be equally important as IL-12.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast to these Th-dependent CTL responses, viruses are often able to induce protective CTL-responses in the absence of T help (for review, see (\nBachmann, M. F., et al., J. Immunol. 161:5791 (1998\n)). Specifically, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) (\nLeist, T. P., et al., J. Immunol. 138:2278 (1987\n); \nAhmed, R., et al., J. ViroL 62:2102 (1988\n); \nBattegay, M., et al., Cell Immunol. 167:115 (1996\n); \nBorrow, P., et al., J. Exp. Med. 183:2129 (1996\n); \nWhitmire, J. K., et al., J. Virol. 70:8375 (1996\n)), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (\nKündig, T. M., et al., Immunity 5:41 (1996\n)), influenza virus (\nTripp, R. A., et al., J. Immunol. 155:2955 (1995\n)), vaccinia virus (\nlegist, T. P., et al., Scand. J. Immunol. 30:679 (1989\n)) and ectromelia virus (\nBuller, R., et al., Nature 328:77 (1987\n)) were able to prime CTL-responses in mice depleted of CD4\n+\n T cells or deficient for the expression of class II or CD40. The mechanism for this Th cell independent CTL-priming by viruses is presently not understood. Moreover, most viruses do not stimulate completely Th cell independent CTL-responses, but virus-specific CTL-activity is reduced in Th-cell deficient mice. Thus, Th cells may enhance anti-viral CTL-responses but the mechanism of this help is not fully understood yet. DCs have recently been shown to present influenza derived antigens by cross-priming (\nAlbert, M. L., et al., J. Exp. Med. 188:1359 (1998\n); \nAlbert, M. L., et al., Nature 392:86 (1998\n)). It is therefore possible that, similarly as shown for minor histocompatibility antigens and tumor antigens (\nRidge, J. P., et al., Nature 393:474 (1998\n); \nBennett, S. R M., et al., Nature 393:478 (1998\n); \nSchoenenberger, S. P., et al., Nature 393:480 (1998\n)), Th cells may assist induction of CTLs via CD40 triggering on DCs. Thus, stimulation of CD40 using CD40L or anti-CD40 antibodies may enhance CTL induction after stimulation with viruses or tumor cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, although CD40L is an important activator of DCs, there seem to be additional molecules that can stimulate maturation and activation of DCs during immune responses. In fact, CD40 is not measurably involved in the induction of CTLs specific for LCMV or VSV (\nRuedl, C., et al., J. Exp. Med. 189:1875 (1999\n)). Thus, although VSV-specific CTL responses are partly dependent upon the presence of CD4\n+\nT cells (\nKündig, T. M., et al., Immunity 5:41 (1996\n)), this helper effect is not mediated by CD40L. Candidates for effector molecules triggering maturation of DCs during immune responses include Trance and TNFα (\nBachmann, M. F., et al., J. Exp. Med. 189:1025 (1999\n); \nSallusto, F., and A. Lanzavecchia, J Exp Med 179:1109 (1994\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well established that the administration of purified proteins alone is usually not sufficient to elicit a strong immune response; isolated antigen generally must be given together with helper substances called adjuvants. Within these adjuvants, the administered antigen is protected against rapid degradation, and the adjuvant provides an extended release of a low level of antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnlike isolated proteins, viruses induce prompt and efficient immune responses in the absence of any adjuvants both with and without T-cell help (\nBachmann & Zinkernagel, Ann. Rev Immunol. 15:235-270 (1997\n)). Although viruses often consist of few proteins, they are able to trigger much stronger immune responses than their isolated components. For B cell responses, it is known that one crucial factor for the immunogenicity of viruses is the repetitiveness and order of surface epitopes. Many viruses exhibit a quasi-crystalline surface that displays a regular array of epitopes which efficiently crosslinks epitope-specific immunoglobulins on B cells (\nBachmann & Zinkernagel, Immunol. Today 17:553-558 (1996\n)). This crosslinking of surface immunoglobulins on B cells is a strong activation signal that directly induces cell-cycle progression and the production of IgM antibodies. Further, such triggered B cells are able to activate T helper cells, which in turn induce a switch from IgM to IgG antibody production in B cells and the generation of long-lived B cell memory - the goal of any vaccination (\nBachmann & Zinkernagel, Ann. Rev. Immunol. 15:235-270 (1997\n)). Viral structure is even linked to the generation of anti-antibodies in autoimmune disease and as a part of the natural response to pathogens (\nsee\n \nFehr, T., et al., J. Exp. Med. 185:1785-1792 (1997\n)). Thus, antigens on viral particles that are organized in an ordered and repetitive array are highly immunogenic since they can directly activate B cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to strong B cell responses, viral particles are also able to induce the generation of a cytotoxic T cell response, another crucial arm of the immune system. These cytotoxic T cells are particularly important for the elimination of non-cytopathic viruses such as HIV or Hepatitis B virus and for the eradication of tumors. Cytotoxic T cells do not recognize native antigens but rather recognize their degradation products in association with MHC class I molecules (\nTownsend & Bodmer, Ann. Rev. Immunol. 7:601-624 (1989\n)). Macrophages and dendritic cells are able to take up and process exogenous viral particles (but not their soluble, isolated components) and present the generated degradation product to cytotoxic T cells, leading to their activation and proliferation (\nKovacsovics-Bankowski et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:4942-4946 (1993\n); \nBachmann et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 26:2595-2600 (1996\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nViral particles as antigens exhibit two advantages over their isolated components: (1) due to their highly repetitive surface structure, they are able to directly activate B cells, leading to high antibody titers and long-lasting B cell memory; and (2) viral particles, but not soluble proteins, have the potential to induce a cytotoxic T cell response, even if the viruses are non-infectious and adjuvants are absent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral new vaccine strategies exploit the inherent immunogenicity of viruses. Some of these approaches focus on the particulate nature of the virus particle; for example \nsee\n \nHarding, C.V. and Song, R., (J. Immunology 153:4925 (1994\n)), which discloses a vaccine consisting of latex beads and antigen; \nKovacsovics-Bankowski, M., et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:4942-4946 (1993\n)), which discloses a vaccine consisting of iron oxide beads and antigen; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,334,394 to Kossovsky, N., et al.\n \n \n,\n which discloses core particles coated with antigen; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,871,747\n \n, which discloses synthetic polymer particles carrying on the surface one or more proteins covalently bonded thereto; and a core particle with a non-covalently bound coating, which at least partially covers the surface of said core particle, and at least one biologically active agent in contact with said coated core particle (\nsee, e.g.,\n \n \nWO 94/15585\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further development, virus-like particles (VLPs) are being exploited in the area of vaccine production because of both their structural properties and their non-infectious nature. VLPs are supermolecular structures built in a symmetric manner from many protein molecules of one or more types. They lack the viral genome and, therefore, are noninfectious. VLPs can often be produced in large quantities by heterologous expression and can be easily be purified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, DNA rich in non-methylated CG motifs (CpG), as present in bacteria and most non-vertebrates, exhibits a potent stimulatory activity on B cells, dendritic cells and other APC's \nin vitro\n as well as \nin vivo.\n Although bacterial DNA is immunostimulatory across many vertebrate species, the individual CpG motifs may differ. In fact, CpG motifs that stimulate mouse immune cells may not necessarily stimulate human immune cells and vice versa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough DNA oligomers rich in CpG motifs can exhibit immunostimulatory capacity, their efficiency is often limited, since they are unstable \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo.\n Thus, they exhibit unfavorable pharmacokinetics. In order to render CpG-oligonucleotides more potent, it is therefore usually necessary to stabilize them by introducing phosphorothioate modifications of the phosphate backbone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA second limitation for the use of CpG-oligonucleotides to stimulate immune responses is their lack of specificity, since all APC's and B cells in contact with CpG-oligonucleotides become stimulated. Thus, the efficiency and specificity of CpG-oligonucleotides may be improved by stabilizing them or packaging them in a way that restricts cellular activation to those cells that also present the relevant antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, immunostimulatory CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides induce strong side effects by causing extramedullary hemopoiesis accomponied by splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy in mice (\nSparwasser et al., J. Immunol. (1999), 162:2368-74\n and Example 18).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVLPs have been shown to be efficiently presented on MHC class I molecules as they, presumably after uptake by macropinocytosis, are efficiently processed and crossprimed onto MHC class I. The mechanism of crosspriming is not clear to date, but TAP-dependent and TAP-independent pathways have been proposed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere have been remarkable advances made in vaccination strategies recently, yet there remains a need for improvement on existing strategies. In particular, there remains a need in the art for the development of new and improved vaccines that promote a strong CTL immune response and anti-pathogenic protection as efficiently as natural pathogens in the absence of generalized activation of APCs and other cells.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention is based on the surprising finding that immunostimulatory substances such as DNA oligonucleotides can be packaged into VLPs which renders them more immunogenic. Unexpectedly, the nucleic acids and oligonucleotides, respectively, present in VLPs can be replaced specifically by the immunostimulatory substances and DNA-oligonucleotides containing CpG motifs, respectively. Surprisingly, these packaged immunostimulatory substances, in particular immunostimulatory nucleic acids such as unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotides retained their immunostimulatory capacity without widespread activation of the innate immune system. The compositions comprising VLP's and the immunostimulatory substances in accordance with the present invention, and in particular the CpG-VLPs are dramatically more immunogenic than their CpG-free counterparts and induce enhanced B and T cell responses. The immune response against antigens optionally coupled, fused or attached otherwise to the VLPs is similarly enhanced as the immune response against the VLP itself. In addition, the T cell responses against both the VLPs and antigens are especially directed to the Th1 type. Antigens attached to CpG-loaded VLPs may therefore be ideal vaccines for prophylactic or therapeutic vaccination against allergies, tumors and other self-molecules and chronic viral diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a first embodiment, the invention provides a composition for enhancing an immune response in an animal comprising a virus-like particle and an immunostimulatory substance, preferably an immunostimulatory nucleic acid, an even more preferably an unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotide, where the substance, nucleic acid or oligonucleotide is coupled, fused, or otherwise attached to or enclosed by, \ni.e.\n, bound, to the virus-like particle. In another embodiment, the composition further comprises an antigen bound to the virus-like particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment of the invention, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids, in particular the unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotides are stabilized by phosphorothioate modifications of the phosphate backbone. In another preferred embodiment, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids, in particular the unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotides are packaged into the VLPs by digestion of RNA within the VLPs and simultaneous addition of the DNA oligonucleotides containing CpGs of choice. In an equally preferred embodiment, the VLPs can be disassembled before they are reassembled in the presence of CpGs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids do not contain CpG motifs but nevertheless exhibit immunostimulatory activities. Such nucleic acids are described in \n \nWO 01/22972\n \n. All sequences described therein are hereby incorporated by way of reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment, the virus-like particle is a recombinant virus-like particle. Also preferred, the virus-like particle is free of a lipoprotein envelope. Preferably, the recombinant virus-like particle comprises, or alternatively consists of, recombinant proteins of Hepatitis B virus, BK virus or other human Polyoma virus, measles virus, Sindbis virus, Rotavirus, Foot-and-Mouth-Disease virus, Retrovirus, Norwalk virus or human Papilloma virus, RNA-phages, Qβ-phage, GA-phage, fr-phage and Ty. In a specific embodiment, the virus-like particle comprises, or alternatively consists of, one or more different Hepatitis B virus core (capsid) proteins (HBcAgs).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment, the virus-like particle comprises recombinant proteins, or fragments thereof, of a RNA-phage. Preferred RNA-phages are Qβ-phage, AP 205-phage, GA-phage, fr-phage\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the antigen is a recombinant antigen. In yet another embodiment, the antigen can be selected from the group consisting of:\n\n \n \n \n(1) a polypeptide suited to induce an immune response against cancer cells; (2) a polypeptide suited to induce an immune response against infectious diseases;\n \n(3) a polypeptide suited to induce an immune response against allergens; (4) a polypeptide suited to induce an improved response against self-antigens; and\n \n(5) a polypeptide suited to induce an immune response in farm animals or pets.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the antigen can be selected from the group consisting of: (1) an organic molecule suited to induce an immune response against cancer cells; (2) an organic molecule suited to induce an immune response against infectious diseases; (3) an organic molecule suited to induce an immune response against allergens; (4) an organic molecule suited to induce an improved response against self-antigens; (5) an organic molecule suited to induce an immune response in farm animals or pets; and (6) an organic molecule suited to induce a response against a drug, a hormone or a toxic compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment, the antigen comprises, or alternatively consists of, a cytotoxic T cell epitope. In a related embodiment, the virus-like particle comprises the Hepatitis B virus core protein and the cytotoxic T cell epitope is fused to the C-terminus of said Hepatitis B virus core protein. In one embodiment, they are fused by a leucine linking sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of enhancing an immune response in a human or other animal species comprising introducing into the animal a composition comprising a virus-like particle and immunostimulatory substance, preferably an immunostimulatory nucleic acid, an even more preferably an unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotide where the substance, preferably the nucleic acid, and even more preferally the oligonucleotide is bound (\ni.e.\n coupled, attached or enclosed) to the virus-like particle. In a further embodiment, the composition further comprises an antigen bound to the virus-like particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment of the invention, the composition is introduced into an animal subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intranasally, intradermally, intravenously or directly into a lymph node. In an equally preferred embodiment, the immune enhancing composition is applied locally, near a tumor or local viral reservoir against which one would like to vaccinate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred aspect of the invention, the immune response is a T cell response, and the T cell response against the antigen is enhanced. In a specific embodiment, the T cell response is a cytotoxic T cell response, and the cytotoxic T cell response against the antigen is enhanced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to a vaccine comprising an immunologically effective amount of the immune enhancing composition of the present invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or excipient. In a preferred embodiment, the vaccine further comprises at least one adjuvant, such as incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The invention also provides a method of immunizing and/or treating an animal comprising administering to the animal an immunologically effective amount of the disclosed vaccine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment of the invention, the immunostimulatory substance-containing VLPs, preferably the immunostimulatory nucleic acid-containing VLP's, an even more preferably the unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotide VLPs are used for vaccination of animals or humans against the VLP itself or against antigens coupled, fused or attached otherwise to the VLP. The modified VLPs can be used to vaccinate against tumors, viral diseases, self-molecules and self antigens, respectively, or non-peptidic small molecules, for example. The vaccination can be for prophylactic or therapeutic purposes, or both. Also, the modified VLPs can be used to vaccinate against allergies in order to induce immune-deviation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the majority of cases, the desired immune response will be directed against antigens coupled, fused or attached otherwise to the immunostimulatory substance-containing VLPs, preferably the immunostimulatory nucleic acid-containing VLP's, an even more preferably the unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotide VLPs. The antigens can be peptides, proteins, domains, carbohydrates or small molecules such as, for example, steroid hormones or drugs, such as nicotine. Under some conditions, the desired immune response can be directed against the VLP itself. This latter application will be used in cases where the VLP originates from a virus against which one would like to vaccinate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe route of injection is preferably subcutaneous or intramuscular, but it would also be possible to apply the CpG-containing VLPs intradermally, intranasally, intravenously or directly into the lymph node. In an equally preferred embodiment, the CpG-containing antigen-coupled or free VLPs are applied locally, near a tumor or local viral reservoir against which one would like to vaccinate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.\n\n\n \n \nBrief Description Of The Drawings\n/\nFigures\n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nFigure 1\n shows the DNA sequence of the CpG-oligonucleotide (A) and the DNA sequence of the peptide p33-containing VLP derived from hepatitis B core (B). The nonameric p33 epitope is genetically fused to the C-terminus of the hepatitis B core protein at position 185 via a three leucine linking sequence.\n\n\n \nFigure 2\n shows the structure of the p33-VLPs as assessed by electron microscopy (A) and SDS PAGE (B). Recombinantly produced wild-type VLPs (composed of HBcAg [aa 1-185] monomers) and p33-VLPs were loaded onto a Sephacryl S-400 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotechnology AG) for purification. Pooled fractions were loaded onto a Hydroxyapatite column. Flow through (which contains purified HBc capsids) was collected and loaded onto a reducing SDS-PAGE gel for monomer molecular weight analysis (B).\n\n\n \nFigure 3\n shows p33-VLPs in a native agarose gel electrophoresis (1% agarose) after control incubation or after digestion with RNase A upon staining with ethidium bromide (A) or Coomassie blue (B) in order to assess for the presence of RNA or protein. Recombinantly produced p33-VLPs were diluted at a final concentration of 0.5 ug/ul protein in PBS buffer and incubated in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of RNase A (100 ug/ml) (Sigma, Division of Fluka AG, Switzerland) for 2 h at 37°C. The samples were subsequently complemented with 6-fold concentrated DNA-loading buffer (MBS Fermentas GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) and run for 30 min at 100 volts in a 1% native agarose gel. The Gene Ruler marker (MBS Fermentas GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) was used as reference for p33-VLPs migration velocity (lane M). Arrows are indicating the presence of RNA packaged in p33-VLPs (A) or p33-VLP capsids themselves (B). Identical results were obtained in 3 independent experiments.\n\n\n \nFigure 4\n shows p33-VLPs in a native agarose gel electrophoresis (1% agarose) after control incubation or after digestion with RNase A in the presence of buffer only or CpG-containing DNA-oligomers upon staining with ethidium bromide (A) or Coomassie blue (B) in order to assess for the presence of RNA/DNA or protein. Recombinant p33-VLPs were diluted at a final concentration of 0.5 ug/ul protein in PBS buffer and incubated in the absence (lane 1) or presence (\nlane\n 2 and 3) of RNase A (100 ug/ml) (Sigma, Division of Fluka AG, Switzerland) for 2 h at 37°C. 5 nmol CpG-oligonucleotides (containing phosphorothioate modification of the backbone) were added to \nsample\n 3 before RNase A digestion. The Gene Ruler marker (MBS Fermentas GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) was used as reference for p33-VLPs migration velocity (lane M). Arrows are indicating the presence of RNA or CpG-oligonucleotides in p33-VLPs (A) or p33-VLPs capsids themselves (B). Identical results were obtained when CpG oligonucleotides with phosphodiester bonds were used for co-incubation of VLPs with RNase A.\n\n\n \nFigure 5\n shows p33-VLPs in a native agarose gel electrophoresis (1% agarose) before and after digestion with RNase A in the presence of CpG-containing DNA-oligomers and subsequent dialysis (for the elimination of VLP-unbound CpG DNA) upon staining with ethidium bromide (A) or Coomassie blue (B) in order to assess for the presence of DNA or protein. Recombinant p33-VLPs were diluted at a final concentration of 0.5 ug/ul protein in PBS buffer and incubated in absence (lane 1) or in presence (\nlanes\n 2 to 5) of RNase A (100 ug/ml) (Sigma, Division of Fluka AG, Switzerland) for 2 h at 37°C. 50 nmol CpG-oligonucleotides (containing phosphorothioate modification of the phosphate backbone: \n \nlanes\n \n 2 and 3, containing phosphodiester bonds: \nlanes\n 4 and 5) were added to VLPs before RNase A digestion. Treated samples were extensively dialysed for 24 hours against PBS (4500-fold dilution) with a 300 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane (Spectrum Medical Industries Inc., Houston, USA) to eliminate the in excess DNA (\nlanes\n 3 and 5). The Gene Ruler marker (MBS Fermentas GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) was used as reference for p33-VLPs migration velocity (lane M). Arrows are indicating the presence of RNA or CpG-oligonucleotides in p33-VLPs (A) or p33-VLP capsids themselves (B).\n\n\n \nFigure 6\n shows p33-VLPs in a native agarose gel electrophoresis (1% agarose) after control incubation or after digestion with RNase A where CpG-containing oligonucleotides were added only after completing the RNA digestion upon staining with ethidium bromide (A) or Coomassie blue (B) in order to assess for the presence of RNA/DNA or protein. Recombinant p33-VLPs were diluted at a final concentration of 0.5 ug/ul protein in PBS buffer and incubated in the absence (lane 1) or presence (\nlane\n 2 and 3) of RNase A (100 ug/ml) (Sigma, Division of Fluka AG, Switzerland) for 2 h at 37°C. 5 nmol CpG-oligonucleotides (containing phosphorothioate modification of the phosphate backbone) were added to \nsample\n 3 only after the RNase A digestion. The Gene Ruler marker (MBS Fermentas GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) was used as reference for p33-VLPs migration velocity (lane M).

Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are hereinafter described.\n\n\n \n1. Definitions\n\n\n \n \n \nAmino acid linker: An \"amino acid linker\", or also just termed \"linker\" within this specification, as used herein, either associates the antigen or antigenic determinant with the second attachment site, or more preferably, already comprises or contains the second attachment site, typically - but not necessarily - as one amino acid residue, preferably as a cysteine residue. The term \"amino acid linker\" as used herein, however, does not intend to imply that such an amino acid linker consists exclusively of amino acid residues, even if an amino acid linker consisting of amino acid residues is a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The amino acid residues of the amino acid linker are, preferably, composed of naturally occuring amino acids or unnatural amino acids known in the art, all-L or all-D or mixtures thereof. However, an amino acid linker comprising a molecule with a sulfhydryl group or cysteine residue is also encompassed within the invention. Such a molecule comprise preferably a C1-C6 alkyl-, cycloalkyl (C5,C6), aryl or heteroaryl moiety. However, in addition to an amino acid linker, a linker comprising preferably a C1-C6 alkyl-, cycloalkyl- (C5,C6), aryl- or heteroaryl- moiety and devoid of any amino acid(s) shall also be encompassed within the scope of the invention. Association between the antigen or antigenic determinant or optionally the second attachment site and the amino acid linker is preferably by way of at least one covalent bond, more preferably by way of at least one peptide bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimal: As used herein, the term \"animal\" is meant to include, for example, humans, sheep, horses, cattle, pigs, dogs, cats, rats, mice, mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, insects and arachnids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody: As used herein, the term \"antibody\" refers to molecules which are capable of binding an epitope or antigenic determinant. The term is meant to include whole antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, including single-chain antibodies. Most preferably the antibodies are human antigen binding antibody fragments and include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab' and F(ab')2, Fd, single-chain Fvs (scFv), single-chain antibodies, disulfide-linked Fvs (sdFv) and fragments comprising either a V\nL\n or V\nH\n domain. The antibodies can be from any animal origin including birds and mammals. Preferably, the antibodies are human, murine, rabbit, goat, guinea pig, camel, horse or chicken. As used herein, \"human\" antibodies include antibodies having the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and include antibodies isolated from human immunoglobulin libraries or from animals transgenic for one or more human immunoglobulins and that do not express endogenous immunoglobulins, as described, for example, in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,939,598 by Kucherlapati et al.\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen: As used herein, the term \"antigen\" refers to a molecule capable of being bound by an antibody or a T cell receptor (TCR) if presented by MHC molecules. The term \"antigen\", as used herein, also encompasses T-cell epitopes. An antigen is additionally capable of being recognized by the immune system and/or being capable of inducing a humoral immune response and/or cellular immune response leading to the activation of B- and/or T-lymphocytes. This may, however, require that, at least in certain cases, the antigen contains or is linked to a Th cell epitope and is given in adjuvant. An antigen can have one or more epitopes (B- and T- epitopes). The specific reaction referred to above is meant to indicate that the antigen will preferably react, typically in a highly selective manner, with its corresponding antibody or TCR and not with the multitude of other antibodies or TCRs which may be evoked by other antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"microbial antigen\" as used herein is an antigen of a microorganism and includes, but is not limited to, infectious virus, infectious bacteria, parasites and infectious fungi. Such antigens include the intact microorganism as well as natural isolates and fragments or derivatives thereof and also synthetic or recombinant compounds which are identical to or similar to natural microorganism antigens and induce an immune response specific for that microorganism. A compound is similar to a natural microorganism antigen if it induces an immune response (humoral and/or cellular) to a natural microorganism antigen. Such antigens are used routinely in the art and are well known to the skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of infectious viruses that have been found in humans include but are not limited to: Retroviridae (e.g. human immunodeficiency viruses, such as HIV-1 (also referred to as HTLV-III, LAV or HTLV-III/LAV, or HIV-III); and other isolates, such as HIV-LP); Picornaviridae (e.g. polio viruses, hepatitis A virus; enteroviruses, human Coxsackie viruses, rhinoviruses, echoviruses); Calciviridae (e.g. strains that cause gastroenteritis); Togaviridae (e.g. equine encephalitis viruses, rubella viruses); Flaviridae (e.g. dengue viruses, encephalitis viruses, yellow fever viruses); Coronoviridae (e.g. coronaviruses); Rhabdoviradae (e.g. vesicular stomatitis viruses, rabies viruses); Filoviridae (e.g. ebola viruses); Paramyxoviridae (e.g. parainfluenza viruses, mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus); Orthomyxoviridae (e.g. influenza viruses); Bungaviridae (e.g. Hantaan viruses, bunga viruses, phleboviruses and Nairo viruses); Arena viridae (hemorrhagic fever viruses); Reoviridae (e.g. reoviruses, orbiviurses and rotaviruses); Birnaviridae; Hepadnaviridae (Hepatitis B virus); Parvovirida (parvoviruses); Papovaviridae (papilloma viruses, polyoma viruses); Adenoviridae (most adenoviruses); Herpesviridae (herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes virus); Poxviridae (variola viruses, vaccinia viruses, pox viruses); and Iridoviridae (e.g. African swine fever virus); and unclassified viruses (e.g. the etiological agents of Spongiform encephalopathies, the agent of delta hepatitis (thought to be a defective satellite of hepatitis B virus), the agents of non-A, non-B hepatitis (class 1=internally transmitted; class 2=parenterally transmitted (i.e. Hepatitis C); Norwalk and related viruses, and astroviruses).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth gram negative and gram positive bacteria serve as antigens in vertebrate animals. Such gram positive bacteria include, but are not limited to, Pasteurella species, Staphylococci species and Streptococcus species. Gram negative bacteria include, but are not limited to, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas species, and Salmonella species. Specific examples of infectious bacteria include but are not limited to: \nHelicobacter pyloris, Borelia burgdorferi, Legionella pneumophilia,\n Mycobacteria sps. (e.g. \nM. tuberculosis, M. avium, M. intracellulare, M. kansaii, M. gordonae\n), \nStaphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pyogenes\n (Group A Streptococcus), \nStreptococcus agalactiae\n (Group B Streptococcus), Streptococcus (viridans group), \nStreptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus bovis,\n Streptococcus (anaerobic sps.), \nStreptococcus pneumoniae,\n pathogenic Campylobacter sp., Enterococcus sp., \nHaemophilus influenzae, Bacillus antracis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae,\n Corynebacterium sp., \nErysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Clostridium perfringers, Clostridium tetani, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pasturella multocida,\n Bacteroides sp., \nFusobacterium nucleatum, Streptobacillus moniliformis, Treponema pallidium, Treponema pertenue,\n Leptospira, Rickettsia, \nActinomyces israelli\n and \nChlamydia.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of infectious fungi include: \nCryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Chlamydia trachomatis\n and \nCandida albicans.\n Other infectious organisms (\ni.e.\n, protists) include: Plasmodium such as \nPlasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium vivax, Toxoplasma\n gondii and \nShistosoma.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther medically relevant microorganisms have been descried extensively in the literature, \ne.g., see\n \nC. G. A. Thomas, \"\nMedical Microbiology\n\", Bailliere Tindall, Great Britain 1983\n, the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions and methods of the invention are also useful for treating cancer by stimulating an antigen-specific immune response against a cancer antigen. A \"tumor antigen\" as used herein is a compound, such as a peptide, associated with a tumor or cancer and which is capable of provoking an immune response. In particular, the compound is capable of provoking an immune response when presented in the context of an MHC molecule. Tumor antigens can be prepared from cancer cells either by preparing crude extracts of cancer cells, for example, as described in \nCohen, et al., Cancer Research, 54:1055 (1994\n), by partially purifying the antigens, by recombinant technology or by de novo synthesis of known antigens. Tumor antigens include antigens that are antigenic portions of or are a whole tumor or cancer polypeptide. Such antigens can be isolated or prepared recombinantly or by any other means known in the art. Cancers or tumors include, but are not limited to, biliary tract cancer; brain cancer; breast cancer; cervical cancer; choriocarcinoma; colon cancer; endometrial cancer; esophageal cancer; gastric cancer; intraepithelial neoplasms; lymphomas; liver cancer; lung cancer (e.g. small cell and non-small cell); melanoma; neuroblastomas; oral cancer; ovarian cancer; pancreas cancer; prostate cancer; rectal cancer; sarcomas; skin cancer; testicular cancer; thyroid cancer; and renal cancer, as well as other carcinomas and sarcomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigenic determinant: As used herein, the term \"antigenic determinant\" is meant to refer to that portion of an antigen that is specifically recognized by either B- or T-lymphocytes. B-lymphocytes respond to foreign antigenic determinants via antibody production, whereas T-lymphocytes are the mediator of cellular immunity. Thus, antigenic determinants or epitopes are those parts of an antigen that are recognized by antibodies, or in the context of an MHC, by T-cell receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen presenting cell: As used herein, the term \"antigen presenting cell\" is meant to refer to a heterogenous population of leucocytes or bone marrow derived cells which possess an immunostimulatory capacity. For example, these cells are capable of generating peptides bound to MHC molecules that can be recognized by T cells. The term is synonymous with the term \"accessory cell\" and includes, for example, Langerhans' cells, interdigitating cells, B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Under some conditions, epithetral cells, endothelial cells and other, non-bone marrow derived cells may also serve as antigen presenting cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssociation: As used herein, the term \"association\" as it applies to the first and second attachment sites, refers to the binding of the first and second attachment sites that is preferably by way of at least one non-peptide bond. The nature of the association may be covalent, ionic, hydrophobic, polar or any combination thereof, preferably the nature of the association is covalent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAttachment Site, First: As used herein, the phrase \"first attachment site\" refers to an element of non-natural or natural origin, to which the second attachment site located on the antigen or antigenic determinant may associate. The first attachment site may be a protein, a polypeptide, an amino acid, a peptide, a sugar, a polynucleotide, a natural or synthetic polymer, a secondary metabolite or compound (biotin, fluorescein, retinol, digoxigenin, metal ions, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride), or a combination thereof, or a chemically reactive group thereof. The first attachment site is located, typically and preferably on the surface, of the virus-like particle. Multiple first attachment sites are present on the surface of virus-like particle typically in a repetitive configuration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAttachment Site, Second: As used herein, the phrase \"second attachment site\" refers to an element associated with the antigen or antigenic determinant to which the first attachment site located on the surface of the virus-like particle may associate. The second attachment site of the antigen or antigenic determinant may be a protein, a polypeptide, a peptide, a sugar, a polynucleotide, a natural or synthetic polymer, a secondary metabolite or compound (biotin, fluorescein, retinol, digoxigenin, metal ions, phenyhnethylsulfonylfluoride), or a combination thereof, or a chemically reactive group thereof. At least one second attachment site is present on the antigen or antigenic determinant. The term \"antigen or antigenic determinant with at least one second attachment site\" refers, therefore, to an antigen or antigenic construct comprising at least the antigen or antigenic determinant and the second attachment site. However, in particular for a second attachment site, which is of non-natural origin, i.e. not naturally occurring within the antigen or antigenic determinant, these antigen or antigenic constructs comprise an \"amino acid linker\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBound: As used herein, the term \"bound\" refers to binding that may be covalent, \ne.g.\n, by chemically coupling, or non-covalent, \ne.g.\n, ionic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, etc. Covalent bonds can be, for example, ester, ether, phosphoester, amide, peptide, imide, carbon-sulfur bonds, carbon-phosphorus bonds, and the like. The term also includes the enclosement, or partial enclosement, of a substance. The term \"bound\" is broader than and includes terms such as \"coupled,\" \"fused,\" \"enclosed\", \"packaged\" and \"attached.\" For example, the immunostimulatory substance such as the unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotide can be enclosed by the VLP without the existence of an actual binding, neither covalently nor non-covalently.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCoat protein(s): As used herein, the term \"coat protein(s)\" refers to the protein(s) of a bacteriophage or a RNA-phage capable of being incorporated within the capsid assembly of the bacteriophage or the RNA-phage. However, when referring to the specific gene product of the coat protein gene of RNA-phages the term \"CP\" is used. For example, the specific gene product of the coat protein gene of RNA-phage Qβ is referred to as \"Qβ CP\", whereas the \"coat proteins\" of bacteriophage Qβ comprise the \"Qβ CP\" as well as the A1 protein. The capsid of Bacteriophage Qβ is composed mainly of the Qβ P, with a minor content of the A1 protein. Likewise, the VLP Qβ coat protein contains mainly Qβ CP, with a minor content of A1 protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCoupled: As used herein, the term \"coupled\" refers to attachment by covalent bonds or by strong non-covalent interactions. Any method normally used by those skilled in the art for the coupling of biologically active materials can be used in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusion: As used herein, the term \"fusion\" refers to the combination of amino acid sequences of different origin in one polypeptide chain by in-frame combination of their coding nucleotide sequences. The term \"fusion\" explicitly encompasses internal fusions, i.e., insertion of sequences of different origin within a polypeptide chain, in addition to fusion to one of its termini.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCpG: As used herein, the term \"CpG\" refers to an oligonucleotide which contains an unmethylated cytosine, guanine dinucleotide sequence (e.g. \"CpG DNA\" or DNA containing a cytosine followed by guanosine and linked by a phosphate bond) and stimulates/activates, \ne.g.\n has a mitogenic effect on, or induces or increases cytokine expression by, a vertebrate cell. For example, CpGs can be useful in activating B cells, NK cells and antigen-presenting cells, such as monocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages, and T cells. The CpGs can include nucleotide analogs such as analogs containing phosphorothioester bonds and can be double-stranded or single-stranded. Generally, double-stranded molecules are more stable \nin vivo,\n while single-stranded molecules have increased immune activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEpitope: As used herein, the term \"epitope\" refers to portions of a polypeptide having antigenic or immunogenic activity in an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably in a human. An \"immunogenic epitope,\" as used herein, is defined as a portion of a polypeptide that elicits an antibody response or induces a T-cell response in an animal, as determined by any method known in the art. (\nSee,\n for example, \nGeysen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3998-4002 (1983\n)). The term \"antigenic epitope,\" as used herein, is defined as a portion of a protein to which an antibody can immunospecifically bind its antigen as determined by any method well known in the art. Immunospecific binding excludes non-specific binding but does not necessarily exclude cross-reactivity with other antigens. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic. Antigenic epitopes can also be T-cell epitopes, in which case they can be bound immunospecifically by a T-cell receptor within the context of an MHC molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn epitope can comprise 3 amino acids in a spatial conformation which is unique to the epitope. Generally, an epitope consists of at least about 5 such amino acids, and more usually, consists of at least about 8-10 such amino acids. If the epitope is an organic molecule, it may be as small as Nitrophenyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmune response: As used herein, the term \"immune response\" refers to a humoral immune response and/or cellular immune response leading to the activation or proliferation of B- and/or T-lymphocytes. In some instances, however, the immune responses may be of low intensity and become detectable only when using at least one substance in accordance with the invention. \"Immunogenic\" refers to an agent used to stimulate the immune system of a living organism, so that one or more functions of the immune system are increased and directed towards the immunogenic agent. An \"immunogenic polypeptide\" is a polypeptide that elicits a cellular and/or humoral immune response, whether alone or linked to a carrier in the presence or absence of an adjuvant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunization: As used herein, the terms \"immunize\" or \"immunization\" or related terms refer to conferring the ability to mount a substantial immune response (comprising antibodies or cellular immunity such as effector CTL) against a target antigen or epitope. These terms do not require that complete immunity be created, but rather that an immune response be produced which is substantially greater than baseline. For example, a mammal may be considered to be immunized against a target antigen if the cellular and/or humoral immune response to the target antigen occurs following the application of methods of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunostimulatory nucleic acid: As used herein, the term immunostimulatory nucleic acid refers to a nucleic acid capable of inducing and/or enhancing an immune response. Immunostimulatory nucleic acids, as used herein, comprise ribonucleic acids and in particular deoxyribonucleic acids. Preferably, immunostimulatory nucleic acids contain at least one CpG motif e.g. a CG dinucleotide in which the C is unmethylated. The CG dinucleotide can be part of a palindromic sequence or can be encompassed within a non-palindromic sequence. Immunostimulatory nucleic acids not containing CpG motifs as described above encompass, by way of example, nucleic acids lacking CpG dinucleotides, as well as nucleic acids containing CG motifs with a methylated CG dinucleotide. The term \"immunostimulatory nucleic acid\" as used herein should also refer to nucleic acids that contain modified bases such as 4-bromo-cytosine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunostimulatory substance: As used herein, the term \"immunostimulatory substance\" refers to a substance capable of inducing and/or enhancing an immune response. Immunostimulatory substances, as used herein, include, but are not limited to, toll-like receptor activing substances and substances inducing cytokine secretion. Toll-like receptor activating substances include, but are not limited to, immunostimulatory nucleic acids, peptideoglycans, lipopolysaccharides, lipoteichonic acids, imidazoquinoline compounds, flagellins, lipoproteins, and immunostimulatory organic substances such as taxol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNatural origin: As used herein, the term \"natural origin\" means that the whole or parts thereof are not synthetic and exist or are produced in nature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-natural: As used herein, the term generally means not from nature, more specifically, the term means from the hand of man.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-natural origin: As used herein, the term \"non-natural origin\" generally means synthetic or not from nature; more specifically, the term means from the hand of man.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrdered and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant array: As used herein, the term \"ordered and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant array\" generally refers to a repeating pattern of antigen or antigenic determinant, characterized by a typically and preferably uniform spacial arrangement of the antigens or antigenic determinants with respect to the core particle and virus-like particle, respectively. In one embodiment of the invention, the repeating pattern may be a geometric pattern. Typical and preferred examples of suitable ordered and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant arrays are those which possess strictly repetitive paracrystalline borders of antigens or antigenic determinants, preferably with spacings of 0.5 to 30 nanometers, more preferably 5 to 15 nanometers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOligonucleotide: As used herein, the terms \"oligonucleotide\" or \"oligomer\" refer to a nucleic acid sequence comprising 2 or more nucleotides, generally at least about 6 nucleotides to about 100,000 nucleotides, preferably about 6 to about 2000 nucleotides, and more preferably about 6 to about 300 nucleotides, even more preferably about 20 to about 300 nucleotides, and even more preferably about 20 to about 100 nucleotides. The terms \"oligonucleotide\" or \"oligomer\" also refer to a nucleic acid sequence comprising more than 100 to about 2000 nucleotides, preferably more than 100 to about 1000 nucleotides, and more preferably more than 100 to about 500 nucleotides. \"Oligonucleotide\" also generally refers to any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxribonucleotide, which may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. \"Oligonucleotide\" includes, without limitation, single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single-and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. In addition, \"oligonucleotide\" refers to triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. Further, an oligonucleotide can be synthetic, genomic or recombinant, \ne.g.\n, λ-DNA, cosmid DNA, artificial bacterial chromosome, yeast artificial chromosome and filamentous phage such as M13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"oligonucleotide\" also includes DNAs or RNAs containing one or more modified bases and DNAs or RNAs with backbones modified for stability or for other reasons. For example, suitable nucleotide modifications/analogs include peptide nucleic acid, inosin, tritylated bases, phosphorothioates, alkylphosphorothioates, 5-nitroindole deoxyribofuranosyl, 5-methyldeoxycytosine and 5,6-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxydeoxythymidine. A variety of modifications have been made to DNA and RNA; thus, \"oligonucleotide\" embraces chemically, enzymatically or metabolically modified forms of polynucleotides as typically found in nature, as well as the chemical forms of DNA and RNA characteristic of viruses and cells. Other nucleotide analogs/modifications will be evident to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPackaged: The term \"packaged\" as used herein refers to the state of an immunostimulatory substance, in particular an immunostimulatory nucleic acid in relation to the VLP. The term \"packaged\" as used herein includes binding that may be covalent, \ne.g.\n, by chemically coupling, or non-covalent, \ne.g.\n, ionic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, etc. Covalent bonds can be, for example, ester, ether, phosphoester, amide, peptide, imide, carbon-sulfur bonds, carbon-phosphorus bonds, and the like. The term also includes the enclosement, or partial enclosement, of a substance. The term \"packaged\" includes terms such as \"coupled, \"enclosed\" and \"attached.\" For example, the immunostimulatory substance such as the unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotide can be enclosed by the VLP without the existence of an actual binding, neither covalently nor non-covalently. In preferred embodiments, in particular, if immunostimulatory nucleic acids are the immunostimulatory substances, the term \"packaged\" indicates that the nucleic acid in a packaged state is not accessible to DNAse or RNAse hydrolysis. In preferred embodiments, the immunostimulatory nucleic acid is packaged inside the VLP capsids, most preferably in a non-covalent manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the invention can be combined, optionally, with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. The term \"pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier\" as used herein means one or more compatible solid or liquid fillers, diluents or encapsulating substances which are suitable for administration into a human or other animal. The term \"carrier\" denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate the application.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrganic molecule: As used herein, the term \"organic molecule\" refers to any chemical entity of natural or synthetic origin. In particular the term \"organic molecule\" as used herein encompasses, for example, any molecule being a member of the group of nucleotides, lipids, carbohydrates, polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, steroids, alkaloids, terpenes and fatty acids, being either of natural or synthetic origin. In particular, the term \"organic molecule\" encompasses molecules such as nicotine, cocaine, heroin or other pharmacologically active molecules contained in drugs of abuse. In general an organic molecule contains or is modified to contain a chemical functionality allowing its coupling, binding or other method of attachment to the virus-like particle in accordance with the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptide: As used herein, the term \"polypeptide\" refers to a molecule composed of monomers (amino acids) linearly linked by amide bonds (also known as peptide bonds). It indicates a molecular chain of amino acids and does not refer to a specific length of the product. Thus, peptides, oligopeptides and proteins are included within the definition of polypeptide. This term is also intended to refer to post-expression modifications of the polypeptide, for example, glycosolations, acetylations, phosphorylations, and the like. A recombinant or derived polypeptide is not necessarily translated from a designated nucleic acid sequence. It may also be generated in any manner, including chemical synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA substance which \"enhances\" an immune response refers to a substance in which an immune response is observed that is greater or intensified or deviated in any way with the addition of the substance when compared to the same immune response measured without the addition of the substance. For example, the lytic activity of cytotoxic T cells can be measured, \ne.g.\n using a \n51\nCr release assay, with and without the substance. The amount of the substance at which the CTL lytic activity is enhanced as compared to the CTL lytic activity without the substance is said to be an amount sufficient to enhance the immune response of the animal to the antigen. In a preferred embodiment, the immune response in enhanced by a factor of at least about 2, more preferably by a factor of about 3 or more. The amount of cytokines secreted may also be altered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffective Amount: As used herein, the term \"effective amount\" refers to an amount necessary or sufficient to realize a desired biologic effect. An effective amount of the composition would be the amount that achieves this selected result, and such an amount could be determined as a matter of routine by a person skilled in the art. For example, an effective amount for treating an immune system deficiency could be that amount necessary to cause activation of the immune system, resulting in the development of an antigen specific immune response upon exposure to antigen. The term is also synonymous with \"sufficient amount.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective amount for any particular application can vary depending on such factors as the disease or condition being treated, the particular composition being administered, the size of the subject, and/or the severity of the disease or condition. One of ordinary skill in the art can empirically determine the effective amount of a particular composition of the present invention without necessitating undue experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelf antigen: As used herein, the tem \"self antigen\" refers to proteins encoded by the host's DNA and products generated by proteins or RNA encoded by the host's DNA are defined as self. In addition, proteins that result from a combination of two or several self-molecules or that represent a fraction of a self-molecule and proteins that have a high homology two self-molecules as defined above (>95%, preferably >97%, more preferably >99%) may also be considered self. In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the antigen is a self antigen. Very preferred embodiments of self-antigens useful for the present invention are described \n \nWO 02/056905\n \n, the disclosures of which are herewith incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment: As used herein, the terms \"treatment\", \"treat\", \"treated\" or \"treating\" refer to prophylaxis and/or therapy. When used with respect to an infectious disease, for example, the term refers to a prophylactic treatment which increases the resistance of a subject to infection with a pathogen or, in other words, decreases the likelihood that the subject will become infected with the pathogen or will show signs of illness attributable to the infection, as well as a treatment after the subject has become infected in order to fight the infection, e.g., reduce or eliminate the infection or prevent it from becoming worse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVaccine: As used herein, the term \"vaccine\" refers to a formulation which contains the composition of the present invention and which is in a form that is capable of being administered to an animal. Typically, the vaccine comprises a conventional saline or buffered aqueous solution medium in which the composition of the present invention is suspended or dissolved. In this form, the composition of the present invention can be used conveniently to prevent, ameliorate, or otherwise treat a condition. Upon introduction into a host, the vaccine is able to provoke an immune response including, but not limited to, the production of antibodies, cytokines and/or other cellular responses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, the vaccine of the present invention additionally includes an adjuvant which can be present in either a minor or major proportion relative to the compound of the present invention. The term \"adjuvant\" as used herein refers to non-specific stimulators of the immune response or substances that allow generation of a depot in the host which when combined with the vaccine of the present invention provide for an even more enhanced immune response. A variety of adjuvants can be used. Examples include incomplete Freund's adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide and modified muramyldipeptide. The term \"adjuvant\" as used herein also refers to typically specific stimulators of the immune response which when combined with the vaccine of the present invention provide for an even more enhanced and typically specific immune response. Examples include, but limited to, GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-12, IFNα. Further examples are within the knowledge of the person skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVirus-like particle: As used herein, the term \"virus-like particle\" refers to a structure resembling a virus particle but which has not been demonstrated to be pathogenic. Typically, a virus-like particle in accordance with the invention does not carry genetic information encoding for the proteins of the virus-like particle. In general, virus-like particles lack the viral genome and, therefore, are noninfectious. Also, virus-like particles can often be produced in large quantities by heterologous expression and can be easily purified. Some virus-like particles may contain nucleic acid distinct from their genome. As indicated, a virus-like particle in accordance with the invention is non replicative and noninfectious since it lacks all or part of the viral genome, in particular the replicative and infectious components of the viral genome. A virus-like particle in accordance with the invention may contain nucleic acid distinct from their genome. A typical and preferred embodiment of a virus-like particle in accordance with the present invention is a viral capsid such as the viral capsid of the corresponding virus, bacteriophage, or RNA-phage. The terms \"viral capsid\" or \"capsid\", as interchangeably used herein, refer to a macromolecular assembly composed of viral protein subunits. Typically and preferably, the viral protein subunits assemble into a viral capsid and capsid, respectively, having a structure with an inherent repetitive organization, wherein said structure is, typically, spherical or tubular. For example, the capsids of RNA-phages or HBcAg's have a spherical form of icosahedral symmetry. The term \"capsid-like structure\" as used herein, refers to a macromolecular assembly composed of viral protein subunits ressembling the capsid morphology in the above defined sense but deviating from the typical symmetrical assembly while maintaining a sufficient degree of order and repetitiveness.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVirus-like particle of a bacteriophage: As used herein, the term \"virus-like particle of a bacteriophage\" refers to a virus-like particle resembling the structure of a bacteriophage, being non replicative and noninfectious, and lacking at least the gene or genes encoding for the replication machinery of the bacteriophage, and typically also lacking the gene or genes encoding the protein or proteins responsible for viral attachment to or entry into the host. This definition should, however, also encompass virus-like particles of bacteriophages, in which the aforementioned gene or genes are still present but inactive, and, therefore, also leading to non-replicative and noninfectious virus-like particles of a bacteriophage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVLP of RNA phage coat protein: The capsid structure formed from the self-assembly of 180 subunits of RNA phage coat protein and optionally containing host RNA is referred to as a \"VLP of RNA phage coat protein\". A specific example is the VLP of Qβ coat protein. In this particular case, the VLP of Qβ coat protein may either be assembled exclusively from Qβ CP subunits (generated by expression ofaQβ CP gene containing, for example, a TAA stop codon precluding any expression of the longer A1 protein through suppression, see \nKozlovska, T.M., et al., Intervirology 39: 9-15 (1996\n)), or additionally contain A1 protein subunits in the capsid assembly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"virus particle\" as used herein refers to the morphological form of a virus. In some virus types it comprises a genome surrounded by a protein capsid; others have additional structures (e.g., envelopes, tails, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-enveloped viral particles are made up of a proteinaceous capsid that surrounds and protects the viral genome. Enveloped viruses also have a capsid structure surrounding the genetic material of the virus but, in addition, have a lipid bilayer envelope that surrounds the capsid. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the VLP's are free of a lipoprotein envelope or a lipoprotein-containing envelope. In a further preferred embodiment, the VLP's are free of an envelope altogether.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne, a, or an: When the terms \"one,\" \"a,\" or \"an\" are used in this disclosure, they mean \"at least one\" or \"one or more,\" unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be clear to those skilled in the art, certain embodiments of the invention involve the use of recombinant nucleic acid technologies such as cloning, polymerase chain reaction, the purification of DNA and RNA, the expression of recombinant proteins in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, etc. Such methodologies are well known to those skilled in the art and can be conveniently found in published laboratory methods manuals (\ne.g.,\n \nSambrook, J. et al., eds., MOLECULAR CLONING, A LABORATORY MANUAL, 2nd. edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989\n); \nAusubel, F. et al., eds., CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, John H. Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1997\n)). Fundamental laboratory techniques for working with tissue culture cell lines (\nCelis, J., ed., CELL BIOLOGY, Academic Press, 2nd edition, (1998\n)) and antibody-based technologies (\nHarlow, E. and Lane, D., \"\nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual,\n\" Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1988\n); \nDeutscher, M.P., \"\nGuide to Protein Purification,\n\" Meth. Enzymol. 128, Academic Press San Diego (1990\n); \nScopes, R.K., \"\nProtein Purification Principles and Practice,\n\" 3rd ed., Springer-Verlag, New York (1994\n)) are also adequately described in the literature, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n2. Compositions and Methods for Enhancing an Immune Response\n\n\n \n \n \nThe disclosed invention provides compositions and methods for enhancing an immune response against one or more antigens in an animal. Compositions of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, a virus-like particle and an immunostimulatory substance, preferably an immunostimulatory nucleic acid, and even more preferably an unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotide where the an immunostimulatory substance, the immunostimulatory nucleic acid or the oligonucleotide is bound to the virus-like particle. Furthermore, the invention conveniently enables the practitioner to construct such a composition for various treatment and/or prophylactic prevention purposes, which include the prevention and/or treatment of infectious diseases, as well as chronic infectious diseases, and the prevention and/or treatment of cancers, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVirus-like particles in the context of the present application refer to structures resembling a virus particle but which are not pathogenic. In general, virus-like particles lack the viral genome and, therefore, are noninfectious. Also, virus-like particles can be produced in large quantities by heterologous expression and can be easily purified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the virus-like particle is a recombinant virus-like particle. The skilled artisan can produce VLPs using recombinant DNA technology and virus coding sequences which are readily available to the public. For example, the coding sequence of a virus envelope or core protein can be engineered for expression in a baculovirus expression vector using a commercially available baculovirus vector, under the regulatory control of a virus promoter, with appropriate modifications of the sequence to allow functional linkage of the coding sequence to the regulatory sequence. The coding sequence of a virus envelope or core protein can also be engineered for expression in a bacterial expression vector, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of VLPs include, but are not limited to, the capsid proteins of Hepatitis B virus (\nUlrich, et al., Virus Res. 50:141-182 (1998\n)), measles virus (\nWames, et al., Gene 160:173-178 (1995\n)), Sindbis virus, rotavirus (\n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,071,651\n \n and \n \n5,374,426\n \n), foot-and-mouth-disease virus \n(\n \nTwomey, et al., Vaccines 13:1603-1610, (1995\n)), Norwalk virus (\nJiang, X., et al., Science 250:1580-1583 (1990\n); \nMatsui, S.M., et al., J. Clin. Invest. 87:1456-1461 (1991\n)), the retroviral GAG protein (\n \nPCT Patent Appl. No. WO 96/30523\n \n), the retrotransposon Ty protein p1, the surface protein of Hepatitis B virus (\n \nWO 92/11291\n \n), human papilloma virus (\n \nWO 98/15631\n \n), human polyoma virus (\nSasnauskas K., et al., Biol. Chem. 380(3):381-386 (1999\n); \nSasnauskas K., et al., Generation of recombinant virus-like particles of different polyomaviruses in yeast. 3rd Interational Workshop \"\nVirus-like particles as vaccines.\n\" Berlin, September 26-29 (2001\n)), RNA phages, Ty, fr-phage, GA-phage, AP 205-phage and, in particular, Qβ-phage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, the VLP of the invention is not limited to any specific form. The particle can be synthesized chemically or through a biological process, which can be natural or non-natural. By way of example, this type of embodiment includes a virus-like particle or a recombinant form thereof. In a more specific embodiment, the VLP can comprise, or alternatively consist of, recombinant polypeptides of Rotavirus; recombinant polypeptides of Norwalk virus; recombinant polypeptides of Alphavirus; recombinant proteins which form bacterial pili or pilus-like structures; recombinant polypeptides of Foot and Mouth Disease virus; recombinant polypeptides of measles virus, recombinant polypeptides of Sindbis virus, recombinant polypeptides of Retrovirus; recombinant polypeptides of Hepatitis B virus (\ne.g.\n, a HBcAg); recombinant polypeptides of Tobacco mosaic virus; recombinant polypeptides of Flock House Virus; recombinant polypeptides of human Papillomavirus; recombinant polypeptides of Polyoma virus and, in particular, recombinant polypeptides of human Polyoma virus, and in particular recombinant polypeptides of BK virus; recombinant polypeptides of bacteriophages, recombinant polypeptides of RNA phages; recombinant polypeptides of Ty; recombinant polypeptides of fr-phage, recombinant polypeptides of GA-phage, recombinant polypeptides of AP 205-phage and, in particular, recombinant polypeptides of Qβ-phage. The virus-like particle can further comprise, or alternatively consist of, one or more fragments of such polypeptides, as well as variants of such polypeptides. Variants of polypeptides can share, for example, at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% identity at the amino acid level with their wild-type counterparts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the virus-like particle comprises, consists essentially of, or alternatively consists of recombinant proteins, or fragments thereof, of a RNA-phage. Preferably, the RNA-phage is selected from the group consisting of a) bacteriophage Qβ; b) bacteriophage R17; c) bacteriophage fr; d) bacteriophage GA; e) bacteriophage SP; f) bacteriophage MS2; g) bacteriophage M11; h) bacteriophage MX1; i) bacteriophage NL95; k) bacteriophage f2; and 1) bacteriophage PP7.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the virus-like particle comprises, or alternatively consists essentially of, or alternatively consists of recombinant proteins, or fragments thereof, of the RNA-bacteriophage Qβ or of the RNA-bacteriophage fr.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the recombinant proteins comprise, or alternatively consist essentially of, or alternatively consist of coat proteins of RNA phages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNA-phage coat proteins forming capsids or VLPs, or fragments of the bacteriophage coat proteins compatible with self-assembly into a capsid or a VLP, are, therefore, further preferred embodiments of the present invention. Bacteriophage Qβ coat proteins, for example, can be expressed recombinantly in \nE. coli.\n Further, upon such expression these proteins spontaneously form capsids. Additionally, these capsids form a structure with an inherent repetitive organization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific preferred examples of bacteriophage coat proteins which can be used to prepare compositions of the invention include the coat proteins of RNA bacteriophages such as bacteriophage Qβ (SEQ ID NO:10; PIR Database, Accession No. VCBPQβ referring to QβCP and SEQ ID NO: 11; Accession No. AAA16663 referring to Qβ A1 protein), bacteriophage R17 (SEQ ID NO:12; PIR Accession No. VCBPR7), bacteriophage fr (SEQ ID NO:13; PIR Accession No. VCBPFR), bacteriophage GA (SEQ ID NO:14; GenBank Accession No. NP-040754), bacteriophage SP (SEQ ID NO:15; GenBank Accession No. CAA30374 referring to SP CP and SEQ ID NO: 16; Accession No. referring to SP A1 protein), bacteriophage MS2 (SEQ ID NO:17; PIR Accession No. VCBPM2), bacteriophage M11 (SEQ ID NO:18; GenBank Accession No. AAC06250), bacteriophage MX1 (SEQ ID NO:19; GenBank Accession No. AAC14699), bacteriophage NL95 (SEQ ID NO:20; GenBank Accession No. AAC14704), bacteriophage f2 (SEQ ID NO: 21; GenBank Accession No. P03611), bacteriophage PP7 (SEQ ID NO: 22). Furthermore, the A1 protein of bacteriophage Qβ or C-terminal truncated forms missing as much as 100, 150 or 180 amino acids from its C-terminus may be incorporated in a capsid assembly of Qβ coat proteins. Generally, the percentage of Qβ A1 protein relative to Qβ CP in the capsid assembly will be limited, in order to ensure capsid formation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nQβ coat protein has also been found to self-assemble into capsids when expressed in \nE. coli\n (\nKozlovska TM. et al., GENE 137: 133-137 (1993\n)). The obtained capsids or virus-like particles showed an icosahedral phage-like capsid structure with a diameter of 25 nm and T=3 quasi symmetry. Further, the crystal structure of phage Qβ has been solved. The capsid contains 180 copies of the coat protein, which are linked in covalent pentamers and hexamers by disulfide bridges (\nGohnohammadi, R et al., Structure 4: 543-5554 (1996\n)) leading to a remarkable stability of the capsid of Qβ coat protein. Capsids or VLPs made from recombinant Qβ coat protein may contain, however, subunits not linked via disulfide links to other subunits within the capsid, or incompletely linked. Thus, upon loading recombinant Qβ capsid on non-reducing SDS-PAGE, bands corresponding to monomeric Qβ coat protein as well as bands corresponding to the hexamer or pentamer of Qβ coat protein are visible. Incompletely disulfide-linked subunits could appear as dimer, trimer or even tetramer bands in non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Qβ capsid protein also shows unusual resistance to organic solvents and denaturing agents. Surprisingly, we have observed that DMSO and acetonitrile concentrations as high as 30%, and Guanidinium concentrations as high as 1 M do not affect the stability of the capsid. The high stability of the capsid of Qβ coat protein is an advantageous feature, in particular, for its use in immunization and vaccination of mammals and humans in accordance of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon expression in \nE. coli,\n the N-terminal methionine of Qβ coat protein is usually removed, as we observed by N-terminal Edman sequencing as described in \nStoll, E. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 252:990-993 (1977\n). VLP composed from Qβ coat proteins where the N-terminal methionine has not been removed, or VLPs comprising a mixture of Qβ coat proteins where the N-terminal methionine is either cleaved or present are also within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther RNA phage coat proteins have also been shown to self-assemble upon expression in a bacterial host (\nKastelein, RA. et al., Gene 23: 245-254 (1983\n), \nKozlovskaya, TM. et al., Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 287: 452-455 (1986\n), \nAdhin, MR. et al., Virology 170: 238-242 (1989\n), \nNi, CZ., et al., Protein Sci. 5: 2485-2493 (1996\n), \nPriano, C. et al., J. Mol. Biol. 249: 283-297 (1995\n)). The Qβ phage capsid contains, in addition to the coat protein, the so called read-through protein A1 and the maturation protein A2. A1 is generated by suppression at the UGA stop codon and has a length of 329 aa. The capsid of phage Qβ recombinant coat protein used in the invention is devoid of the A2 lysis protein, and contains RNA from the host. The coat protein of RNA phages is an RNA binding protein, and interacts with the stem loop of the ribosomal binding site of the replicase gene acting as a translational repressor during the life cycle of the virus. The sequence and structural elements of the interaction are known (\nWitherell, GW. & Uhlenbeck, OC. Biochemistry 28: 71-76 (1989\n); \nLim F. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271: 31839-31845 (1996\n)). The stem loop and RNA in general are known to be involved in the virus assembly (\nGolmohammadi, R. et al., Structure 4: 543-5554 (1996\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the virus-like particle comprises, or alternatively consists essentially of, or alternatively consists of recombinant proteins, or fragments thereof, of a RNA-phage, wherein the recombinant proteins comprise, consist essentially of or alternatively consist of mutant coat proteins of a RNA phage, preferably of mutant coat proteins of the RNA phages mentioned above. In another preferred embodiment, the mutant coat proteins of the RNA phage have been modified by removal of at least one lysine residue by way of substitution, or by addition of at least one lysine residue by way of substitution; alternatively, the mutant coat proteins of the RNA phage have been modified by deletion of at least one lysine residue, or by addition of at least one lysine residue by way of insertion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment, the virus-like particle comprises, or alternatively consists essentially of, or alternatively consists of recombinant proteins, or fragments thereof, of the RNA-bacteriophage Qβ, wherein the recombinant proteins comprise, or alternatively consist essentially of, or alternatively consist of coat proteins having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:10, or a mixture of coat proteins having amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:10 and of SEQ ID NO: 11 or mutants of SEQ ID NO: 11 and wherein the N-terminal methionine is preferably cleaved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the virus-like particle comprises, consists essentially of or alternatively consists of recombinant proteins of Qβ, or fragments thereof, wherein the recombinant proteins comprise, or alternatively consist essentially of, or alternatively consist of mutant Qβ coat proteins. In another preferred embodiment, these mutant coat proteins have been modified by removal of at least one lysine residue by way of substitution, or by addition of at least one lysine residue by way of substitution. Alternatively, these mutant coat proteins have been modified by deletion of at least one lysine residue, or by addition of at least one lysine residue by way of insertion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour lysine residues are exposed on the surface of the capsid of Qβ coat protein. Qβ mutants, for which exposed lysine residues are replaced by arginines can also be used for the present invention. The following Qβ coat protein mutants and mutant Qβ VLPs can, thus, be used in the practice of the invention: \"Qβ-240\" (Lys13-Arg; SEQ ID NO:23), \"Qβ-243\" (Asn 10-Lys; SEQ ID NO:24), \"Qβ-250\" (Lys 2-Arg, Lys 13-Arg; SEQ ID NO:25), \"Qβ-251\" (SEQ ID NO:26) and \"Qβ-259\" (Lys 2-Arg, Lys16-Arg; SEQ ID NO:27). Thus, in further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the virus-like particle comprises, consists essentially of or alternatively consists of recombinant proteins of mutant Qβ coat proteins, which comprise proteins having an amino acid sequence selected from the group of a) the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 23; b) the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:24; c) the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 25; d) the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:26; and e) the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 27. The construction, expression and purification of the above indicated Qβ coat proteins, mutant Qβ coat protein VLPs and capsids, respectively, are disclosed in pending \n \nU.S. Application No. 10/050,902 filed on January 18, 2002\n \n. In particular is hereby referred to Example 18 of above mentioned application.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the virus-like particle comprises, or alternatively consists essentially of, or alternatively consists of recombinant proteins of Qβ, or fragments thereof, wherein the recombinant proteins comprise, consist essentially of or alternatively consist of a mixture of either one of the foregoing Qβ mutants and the corresponding A1 protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the virus-like particle comprises, or alternatively essentially consists of, or alternatively consists of recombinant proteins, or fragments thereof, of RNA-phage AP205.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe AP205 genome consists of a maturation protein, a coat protein, a replicase and two open reading frames not present in related phages; a lysis gene and an open reading frame playing a role in the translation of the maturation gene (\nKlovins,J., et al., J. Gen. Virol. 83: 1523-33 (2002\n)). AP205 coat protein can be expressed from plasmid pAP283-58 (SEQ ID NO: 79), which is a derivative of pQb10 (\nKozlovska, T. M. et al., Gene 137:133-37 (1993\n)), and which contains an AP205 ribosomal binding site. Alternatively, AP205 coat protein may be cloned into pQb185, downstream of the ribosomal binding site present in the vector. Both approaches lead to expression of the protein and formation of capsids as described in the co-pending US provisional patent application with the title \"Molecular Antigen Arrays\" (Application No. \n \n60/396,126\n \n) and having been filed on July 17, 2002, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Vectors pQb10 and pQb185 are vectors derived from pGEM vector, and expression of the cloned genes in these vectors is controlled by the trp promoter (\nKozlovska, T. M. et al., Gene 137:133-37 (1993\n)). Plasmid pAP283-58 (SEQ ID NO:79) comprises a putative AP205 ribosomal binding site in the following sequence, which is downstream of the XbaI site, and immediately upstream of the ATG start codon of the AP205 coat protein: \ntctaga\nATTTTCTGCGCACCCAT CCCGGGTGGCGCCCAAAGT\nGAGGAA\nAATCAC\natg\n. The vector pQb185 comprises a Shine Delagarno sequence downstream from the XbaI site and upstream of the start codon (\ntctaga\nTTAACCCAACGCGT\nAGGAG\n TCAGGCC\natg\n, Shine Delagarno sequence underlined).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the virus-like particle comprises, or alternatively essentially consists of, or alternatively consists of recombinant coat proteins, or fragments thereof, of the RNA-phage AP205.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis preferred embodiment of the present invention, thus, comprises AP205 coat proteins that form capsids. Such proteins are recombinantly expressed, or prepared from natural sources. AP205 coat proteins produced in bacteria spontaneously form capsids, as evidenced by Electron Microscopy (EM) and immunodiffusion. The structural properties of the capsid formed by the AP205 coat protein (SEQ ID NO: 80) and those formed by the coat protein of the AP205 RNA phage are nearly indistinguishable when seen in EM. AP205 VLPs are highly immunogenic, and can be linked with antigens and/or antigenic determinants to generate vaccine constructs displaying the antigens and/or antigenic determinants oriented in a repetitive manner. High titers are elicited against the so displayed antigens showing that bound antigens and/or antigenic determinants are accessible for interacting with antibody molecules and are immunogenic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the virus-like particle comprises, or alternatively essentially consists of, or alternatively consists of recombinant mutant coat proteins, or fragments thereof, of the RNA-phage AP205.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssembly-competent mutant forms of AP205 VLPs, including AP205 coat protein with the subsitution of proline at \namino acid\n 5 to threonine (SEQ ID NO: 81), may also be used in the practice of the invention and leads to a further preferred embodiment of the invention. These VLPs, AP205 VLPs derived from natural sources, or AP205 viral particles, may be bound to antigens to produce ordered repetitive arrays of the antigens in accordance with the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAP205 P5-T mutant coat protein can be expressed from plasmid pAP281-32 (SEQ ID No. 82), which is derived directly from pQb185, and which contains the mutant AP205 coat protein gene instead of the Qβ coat protein gene. Vectors for expression of the AP205 coat protein are transfected into E. \ncoli\n for expression of the AP205 coat protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for expression of the coat protein and the mutant coat protein, respectively, leading to self-assembly into VLPs are described in co-pending US provisional patent application with the title \"Molecular Antigen Arrays\" (Application No. \n \n60/396,126\n \n) and having been filed on July 17, 2002, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Suitable E. \ncoli\n strains include, but are not limited to, E. \ncoli\n K802, JM 109, RR1. Suitable vectors and strains and combinations thereof can be identified by testing expression of the coat protein and mutant coat protein, respectively, by SDS-PAGE and capsid formation and assembly by optionally first purifying the capsids by gel filtration and subsequently testing them in an immunodiffusion assay (Ouchterlony test) or Electron Microscopy (\nKozlovska, T. M. et al., Gene 137:133-37 (1993\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAP205 coat proteins expressed from the vectors pAP283-58 and pAP281-32 may be devoid of the initial Methionine amino-acid, due to processing in the cytoplasm of \nE\n. \ncoli.\n Cleaved, uncleaved forms of AP205 VLP, or mixtures thereof are further preferred embodiments of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the virus-like particle comprises, or alternatively essentially consists of, or alternatively consists of a mixture of recombinant coat proteins, or fragments thereof, of the RNA-phage AP205 and of recombinant mutant coat proteins, or fragments thereof, of the RNA-phage AP205.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the virus-like particle comprises, or alternatively essentially consists of, or alternatively consists of fragments of recombinant coat proteins or recombinant mutant coat proteins of the RNA-phage AP205.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant AP205 coat protein fragments capable of assembling into a VLP and a capsid, respectively are also useful in the practice of the invention. These fragments may be generated by deletion, either internally or at the termini of the coat protein and mutant coat protein, respectively. Insertions in the coat protein and mutant coat protein sequence or fusions of antigen sequences to the coat protein and mutant coat protein sequence, and compatible with assembly into a VLP, are further embodiments of the invention and lead to chimeric AP205 coat proteins, and particles, respectively. The outcome of insertions, deletions and fusions to the coat protein sequence and whether it is compatible with assembly into a VLP can be determined by electron microscopy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe particles formed by the AP205 coat protein, coat protein fragments and chimeric coat proteins described above, can be isolated in pure form by a combination of fractionation steps by precipitation and of purification steps by gel filtration using \ne.g\n. Sepharose CL-4B, Sepharose CL-2B, Sepharose CL-6B columns and combinations thereof as described in the co-pending US provisional patent application with the title \"Molecular Antigen Arrays\" (Application No. \n \n60/396,126\n \n) and having been filed on July 17, 2002, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Other methods of isolating virus-like particles are known in the art, and may be used to isolate the virus-like particles (VLPs) of bacteriophage AP205. For example, the use of ultracentrifugation to isolate VLPs of the yeast retrotransposon Ty is described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,918,166\n \n, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crystal structure of several RNA bacteriophages has been determined (\nGolmohammadi, R. et al., Structure 4:543-554 (1996\n)). Using such information, surface exposed residues can be identified and, thus, RNA-phage coat proteins can be modified such that one or more reactive amino acid residues can be inserted by way of insertion or substitution. As a consequence, those modified forms of bacteriophage coat proteins can also be used for the present invention. Thus, variants of proteins which form capsids or capsid-like structures (\ne.g\n., coat proteins of bacteriophage Qβ, bacteriophage R17, bacteriophage fr, bacteriophage GA, bacteriophage SP, and bacteriophage MS2, bacteriophage AP 205) can also be used to prepare compositions of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the sequence of the variants proteins discussed above will differ from their wild-type counterparts, these variant proteins will generally retain the ability to form capsids or capsid-like structures. Thus, the invention further includes compositions and vaccine compositions, respectively, which further includes variants of proteins which form capsids or capsid-like structures, as well as methods for preparing such compositions and vaccine compositions, respectively, individual protein subunits used to prepare such compositions, and nucleic acid molecules which encode these protein subunits. Thus, included within the scope of the invention are variant forms of wild-type proteins which form capsids or capsid-like structures and retain the ability to associate and form capsids or capsid-like structures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result, the invention further includes compositions and vaccine compositions, respectively, comprising proteins, which comprise, or alternatively consist essentially of, or alternatively consist of amino acid sequences which are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% identical to wild-type proteins which form ordered arrays and have an inherent repetitive structure, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther included within the scope of the invention are nucleic acid molecules which encode proteins used to prepare compositions of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the invention further includes compositions comprising proteins, which comprise, or alternatively consist essentially of, or alternatively consist of amino acid sequences which are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% identical to any of the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 10-27.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProteins suitable for use in the present invention also include C-terminal truncation mutants of proteins which form capsids or capsid-like structures, or VLPs. Specific examples of such truncation mutants include proteins having an amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOs:10-27 where 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, or 17 amino acids have been removed from the C-terminus. Typically, theses C-terminal truncation mutants will retain the ability to form capsids or capsid-like structures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther proteins suitable for use in the present invention also include N-terminal truncation mutants of proteins which form capsids or capsid-like structures. Specific examples of such truncation mutants include proteins having an amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOs:10-27 where 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, or 17 amino acids have been removed from the N-tenninus. Typically, these N-terminal truncation mutants will retain the ability to form capsids or capsid-like structures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional proteins suitable for use in the present invention include N- and C-terminal truncation mutants which form capsids or capsid-like structures. Suitable truncation mutants include proteins having an amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOs:10-27 where 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, or 17 amino acids have been removed from the N-terminus and 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, or 17 amino acids have been removed from the C-terminus. Typically, these N-terminal and C-terminal truncation mutants will retain the ability to form capsids or capsid-like structures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further includes compositions comprising proteins which comprise, or alternatively consist essentially of, or alternatively consist of, amino acid sequences which are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% identical to the above described truncation mutants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention thus includes compositions and vaccine compositions prepared from proteins which form capsids or VLPs, methods for preparing these compositions from individual protein subunits and VLPs or capsids, methods for preparing these individual protein subunits, nucleic acid molecules which encode these subunits, and methods for vaccinating and/or eliciting immunological responses in individuals using these compositions of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFragments of VLPs which retain the ability to induce an immune response can comprise, or alternatively consist of, polypeptides which are about 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450 or 500 amino acids in length, but will obviously depend on the length of the sequence of the subunit composing the VLP. Examples of such fragments include fragments of proteins discussed herein which are suitable for the preparation of the immune response enhancing composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment of the invention, the VLP's are free of a lipoprotein envelope or a lipoprotein-containing envelope. In a further preferred embodiment, the VLP's are free of an envelope altogether.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lack of a lipoprotein envelope or lipoprotein-containing envelope and, in particular, the complete lack of an envelope leads to a more defined virus-like particle in its structure and composition. Such more defined virus-like particles, therefore, may minimize side-effects. Moreover, the lack of a lipoprotein-containing envelope or, in particular, the complete lack of an envelope avoids or minimizes incorporation of potentially toxic molecules and pyrogens within the virus-like particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs previously stated, the invention includes virus-like particles or recombinant forms thereof. Skilled artisans have the knowledge to produce such particles and attach antigens thereto. By way of providing other examples, the invention provides herein for the production of Hepatitis B virus-like particles as virus-like particles (Example 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the particles used in compositions of the invention are composed of a Hepatitis B capsid (core) protein (HBcAg) or a fragment of a HBcAg which has been modified to either eliminate or reduce the number of free cysteine residues. \nZhou et al. (J. Virol. 66:5393-5398 (1992\n)) demonstrated that HBcAgs which have been modified to remove the naturally resident cysteine residues retain the ability to associate and form multimeric structures. Thus, core particles suitable for use in compositions of the invention include those comprising modified HBcAgs, or fragments thereof, in which one or more of the naturally resident cysteine residues have been either deleted or substituted with another amino acid residue (\ne.g.\n, a serine residue).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HBcAg is a protein generated by the processing of a Hepatitis B core antigen precursor protein. A number of isotypes of the HBcAg have been identified and their amino acids sequences are readily available to those skilled in the art. For example, the HBcAg protein having the amino acid sequence shown in \nFigure 1\n is 185 amino acids in length and is generated by the processing of a 212 amino acid Hepatitis B core antigen precursor protein. This processing results in the removal of 29 amino acids from the N-terminus of the Hepatitis B core antigen precursor protein. Similarly, the HBcAg protein that is 185 amino acids in length is generated by the processing of a 214 amino acid Hepatitis B core antigen precursor protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, vaccine compositions of the invention will be prepared using the processed form of a HBcAg (i.e., a HBcAg from which the N-terminal leader sequence of the Hepatitis B core antigen precursor protein have been removed).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, when HBcAgs are produced under conditions where processing will not occur, the HBcAgs will generally be expressed in \"processed\" form. For example, bacterial systems, such as E. \ncoli,\n generally do not remove the leader sequences, also referred to as \"signal peptides,\" of proteins which are normally expressed in eukaryotic cells. Thus, when an \nE\n. \ncoli\n expression system directing expression of the protein to the cytoplasm is used to produce HBcAgs of the invention, these proteins will generally be expressed such that the N-terminal leader sequence of the Hepatitis B core antigen precursor protein is not present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparation of Hepatitis B virus-like particles, which can be used for the present invention, is disclosed, for example, in \n \nWO 00/32227\n \n, and hereby in particular in Examples 17 to 19 and 21 to 24, as well as in \n \nWO 01/85208\n \n, and hereby in particular in Examples 17 to 19, 21 to 24, 31 and 41, and in pending \n \nU.S. Application No. 10/050,902 filed on January 18, 2002\n \n. For the latter application, it is in particular referred to Example 23, 24, 31 and 51. All three documents are explicitly incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also includes HBcAg variants which have been modified to delete or substitute one or more additional cysteine residues. Thus, the vaccine compositions of the invention include compositions comprising HBcAgs in which cysteine residues not present in the amino acid sequence shown in \nFigure 1\n have been deleted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well known in the art that free cysteine residues can be involved in a number of chemical side reactions. These side reactions include disulfide exchanges, reaction with chemical substances or metabolites that are, for example, injected or formed in a combination therapy with other substances, or direct oxidation and reaction with nucleotides upon exposure to UV light. Toxic adducts could thus be generated, especially considering the fact that HBcAgs have a strong tendency to bind nucleic acids. The toxic adducts would thus be distributed between a multiplicity of species, which individually may each be present at low concentration, but reach toxic levels when together.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of the above, one advantage to the use of HBcAgs in vaccine compositions which have been modified to remove naturally resident cysteine residues is that sites to which toxic species can bind when antigens or antigenic determinants are attached would be reduced in number or eliminated altogether.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of naturally occurring HBcAg variants suitable for use in the practice of the present invention have been identified. \nYuan et al., (J. Viol. 73:10122-10128 (1999\n)), for example, describe variants in which the isoleucine residue at position corresponding to position 97 in SEQ ID NO:28 is replaced with either a leucine residue or a phenylalanine residue. The amino acid sequences of a number of HBcAg variants, as well as several Hepatitis B core antigen precursor variants, are disclosed in GenBank reports AAF121240 (SEQ ID NO:29), AF121239 (SEQ ID NO:30), X85297 (SEQ ID NO:31), X02496 (SEQ ID NO:32), X85305 (SEQ ID NO:33), X85303 (SEQ ID NO:34), AF151735 (SEQ ID NO:35), X85259 (SEQ ID NO:36), X85286 (SEQ ID NO:37), X85260 (SEQ ID NO:38), X85317.

These HBcAg variants differ in amino acid sequence at a number of positions, including amino acid residues which corresponds to the amino acid residues located at \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12, 13, 21, 22, 24, 29, 32, 33, 35, 38, 40, 42, 44, 45, 49, 51, 57, 58, 59, 64, 66, 67, 69, 74, 77, 80, 81, 87, 92, 93, 97, 98, 100, 103, 105, 106, 109, 113, 116, 121, 126, 130, 133, 135, 141, 147, 149, 157, 176, 178, 182 and 183 in SEQ ID NO:77. Further HBcAg variants suitable for use in the compositions of the invention, and which may be further modified according to the disclosure of this specification are described in \n \nWO 00/198333\n \n, \n \nWO 00/177158\n \n and \n \nWO 00/214478\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHBcAgs suitable for use in the present invention can be derived from any organism so long as they are able to enclose or to be coupled or otherwise attached to, in particular as long as they are capable of packaging, an unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotide and induce an immune response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, generally processed HBcAgs (\ni.e\n., those which lack leader sequences) will be used in the vaccine compositions of the invention. The present invention includes vaccine compositions, as well as methods for using these compositions, which employ the above described variant HBcAgs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther included within the scope of the invention are additional HBcAg variants which are capable of associating to form dimeric or multimeric structures. Thus, the invention further includes vaccine compositions comprising HBcAg polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid sequences which are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97% or 99% identical to any of the wild-type amino acid sequences, and forms of these proteins which have been processed, where appropriate, to remove the N-terminal leader sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhether the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide has an amino acid sequence that is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97% or 99% identical to one of the wild-type amino acid sequences, or a subportion thereof, can be determined conventionally using known computer programs such the Bestfit program. When using Bestfit or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is, for instance, 95% identical to a reference amino acid sequence, the parameters are set such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference amino acid sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5% of the total number of amino acid residues in the reference sequence are allowed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HBcAg variants and precursors having the amino acid sequences set out in SEQ ID NOs: 29-72 and 73-76 are relatively similar to each other. Thus, reference to an amino acid residue of a HBcAg variant located at a position which corresponds to a particular position in SEQ ID NO:77, refers to the amino acid residue which is present at that position in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:77. The homology between these HBcAg variants is for the most part high enough among Hepatitis B viruses that infect mammals so that one skilled in the art would have little difficulty reviewing both the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:77 and in \nFigure 1\n, respectively, and that of a particular HBcAg variant and identifying \"corresponding\" amino acid residues. Furthermore, the HBcAg amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:73, which shows the amino acid sequence of a HBcAg derived from a virus which infect woodchucks, has enough homology to the HBcAg having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:77 that it is readily apparent that a three amino acid residue insert is present in SEQ ID NO:73 between amino acid residues 155 and 156 of SEQ ID NO:77.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also includes vaccine compositions which comprise HBcAg variants of Hepatitis B viruses which infect birds, as wells as vaccine compositions which comprise fragments of these HBcAg variants. As one skilled in the art would recognize, one, two, three or more of the cysteine residues naturally present in these polypeptides could be either substituted with another amino acid residue or deleted prior to their inclusion in vaccine compositions of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed above, the elimination of free cysteine residues reduces the number of sites where toxic components can bind to the HBcAg, and also eliminates sites where cross-linking of lysine and cysteine residues of the same or of neighboring HBcAg molecules can occur. Therefore, in another embodiment of the present invention, one or more cysteine residues of the Hepatitis B virus capsid protein have been either deleted or substituted with another amino acid residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, compositions and vaccine compositions, respectively, of the invention will contain HBcAgs from which the C-terminal region (e.g., amino acid residues 145-185 or 150-185 of SEQ ID NO: 77) has been removed. Thus, additional modified HBcAgs suitable for use in the practice of the present invention include C-terminal truncation mutants. Suitable truncation mutants include HBcAgs where 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 34, 35, amino acids have been removed from the C-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHBcAgs suitable for use in the practice of the present invention also include N-terminal truncation mutants. Suitable truncation mutants include modified HBcAgs where 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, or 17 amino acids have been removed from the N-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther HBcAgs suitable for use in the practice of the present invention include N- and C-terminal truncation mutants. Suitable truncation mutants include HBcAgs where 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, and 17 amino acids have been removed from the N-terminus and 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 34, 35 amino acids have been removed from the C-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further includes compositions and vaccine compositions, respectively, comprising HBcAg polypeptides comprising, or alternatively essentially consisting of, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid sequences which are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, or 99% identical to the above described truncation mutants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention, a lysine residue is introduced into a HBcAg polypeptide, to mediate the binding of the antigen or antigenic determinant to the VLP of HBcAg. In preferred embodiments, compositions of the invention are prepared using a HBcAg comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acids 1-144, or 1-149, 1-185 of SEQ ID NO:77, which is modified so that the amino acids corresponding to positions 79 and 80 are replaced with a peptide having the amino acid sequence of Gly-Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly (SEQ ID NO:78). These compositions are particularly useful in those embodiments where an antigenic determinant is coupled to a VLP of HBcAg. In further preferred embodiments, the cysteine residues at positions 48 and 107 of SEQ ID NO:77 are mutated to serine. The invention further includes compositions comprising the corresponding polypeptides having amino acid sequences shown in any of SEQ ID NOs:29-74 which also have above noted amino acid alterations. Further included within the scope of the invention are additional HBcAg variants which are capable of associating to form a capsid or VLP and have the above noted amino acid alterations. Thus, the invention further includes compositions and vaccine compositions, respectively, comprising HBcAg polypeptides which comprise, or alternatively consist of, amino acid sequences which are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97% or 99% identical to any of the wild-type amino acid sequences, and forms of these proteins which have been processed, where appropriate, to remove the N-terminal leader sequence and modified with above noted alterations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions or vaccine compositions of the invention may comprise mixtures of different HBcAgs. Thus, these vaccine compositions may be composed of HBcAgs which differ in amino acid sequence. For example, vaccine compositions could be prepared comprising a \"wild-type\" HBcAg and a modified HBcAg in which one or more amino acid residues have been altered (\ne.g\n., deleted, inserted or substituted). Further, preferred vaccine compositions of the invention are those which present highly ordered and repetitive antigen arrays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs previously disclosed, the invention is based on the surprising finding that immunostimulatory substances, preferably immunostimulatory nucleic acids and even more preferably DNA oligonucleotides can be packaged into VLPs. Unexpectedly, the nucleic acids present in VLPs can be replaced specifically by the immunostimulatory substances, preferably by the immunostimulatory nucleic acids and even more preferably by the DNA-oligonucleotides containing CpG motifs. As an example, the CpG-VLPs are dramatically more immunogenic and elicit more specific effects than their CpG-free counterparts and induce enhanced B and T cell responses. The immune response against antigens coupled, fused or attached otherwise to the VLPs is similarly enhanced as the immune response against the VLP itself. In addition, the T cell responses against both the VLPs and antigens are especially directed to the Th1 type. Furthermore, the packaged nucleic acids and CpGs, respectively, are protected from degradation, \ni.e\n., they are more stable. Moreover, non-specific activation of cells from the innate immune system is dramatically reduced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe innate immune system has the capacity to recognize invariant molecular pattern shared by microbial pathogens. Recent studies have revealed that this recognition is a crucial step in inducing effective immune responses. The main mechanism by which microbial products augment immune responses is to stimulate APC, expecially dendritic cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines and to expres high levels costimulatory molecules for T cells. These activated dendritic cells subsequently initiate primary T cell responses and dictate the type of T cell-mediated effector function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo classes of nucleic acids, namely 1) bacterial DNA that contains immunostimulatory sequences, in particular unmethylated CpG dinucleotides within specific flanking bases (referred to as CpG motifs) and 2) double-stranded RNA synthesized by various types of viruses represent important members of the microbial components that enhance immune responses. Synthetic double stranded (ds) RNA such as polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) are capable of inducing dendritic cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines and to express high levels of costimulatory molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA series of studies by Tokunaga and Yamamoto et al. has shown that bacterial DNA or synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides induce human PBMC and mouse spleen cells to produce type I interferon (IFN) (reviewed in \nYamamoto et al., Springer Semin Immunopathol. 22:11-19\n). Poly (I:C) was originally synthesized as a potent inducer of type I IFN but also induces other cytokines such as IL-12.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred ribonucleic acid encompass polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid double-stranded RNA (poly I:C). Ribonucleic acids and modifications thereof as well as methods for their production have been described by \nLevy, H.B (Methods Enzymol. 1981, 78:242-251\n), \nDeClercq, E (Methods Enzymol. 1981,78:227-236\n) and \nTorrence, P.F. (Methods Enzymol 1981;78:326-331\n) and references therein. Ribonucleic acids can be isolated from organisms. Ribonucleic acids also encompass further synthetic ribonucleic acids, in particular synthetic poly (I:C) oligonucleotides that have been rendered nuclease resistant by modification of the phosphodiester backbone, in particular by phosphorothioate modifications. In a further embodiment the ribose backbone of poly (I:C) is replaced by a deoxyribose. Those skilled in the art know procedures how to synthesize synthetic oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment of the invention molecules that active toll-like receptors (TLR) are enclosed. Ten human toll-like receptors are known uptodate. They are activated by a variety of ligands. TLR2 is activated by peptidoglycans, lipoproteins, lipoteichonic acid and Zymosan; TLR3 is activated by double-stranded RNA such as poly (I:C); TLR4 is activated by lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acids and taxol; TLR5 is activated by bacterial flagella, especially the flagellin protein; TLR6 is activated by peptidoglycans, TLR7 is activated by imiquimoid and imidazoquinoline compounds, such as R418 and TLR9 is activated by bacterial DNA, in particular CpG DNA. Ligands for TLR1, TLR8 and TLR10 are not known so far. However, recent reports indicate that same receptors can react with different ligands and that further receptors are present. The above list of ligands is not exhaustive and further ligands are within the knowledge of the person skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotide comprises the sequence:\n\n\n\n        5' X\n1\nX\n2\nCGX\n3\nX\n4\n 3'\n\n\n\nwherein X\n1\n, X\n2\n, X\n3\n and X\n4\n are any nucleotide. In addition, the oligonucleotide can comprise about 6 to about 100,000 nucleotides, preferably about 6 to about 2000 nucleotides, more preferably about 20 to about 2000 nucleotides, and even more preferably comprises about 20 to about 300 nucleotides. In addition, the oligonucleotide can comprise more than 100 to about 2000 nucleotides, preferably more than 100 to about 1000 nucleotides, and more preferably more than 100 to about 500 nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the CpG-containing oligonucleotide contains one or more phosphorothioate modifications of the phosphate backbone. For example, a CpG-containing oligonucleotide having one or more phosphate backbone modifications or having all of the phosphate backbone modified and a CpG-containing oligonucleotide wherein one, some or all of the nucleotide phosphate backbone modifications are phosphorothioate modifications are included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CpG-containing oligonucleotide can also be recombinant, genomic, synthetic, cDNA, plasmid-derived and single or double stranded. For use in the instant invention, the nucleic acids can be synthesized de novo using any of a number of procedures well known in the art. For example, the b-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite method (\nBeaucage, S. L., and Caruthers, M. H., Tet. Let. 22:1859 (1981\n); nucleoside H-phosphonate method (\nGaregg et al., Tet. Let. 27:4051-4054 (1986\n); \nFroehler et al., Nucl. Acid. Res. 14:5399-5407 (1986\n); \nGaregg et al., Tet. Let. 27:4055-4058 (1986\n), \nGaffney et al., Tet. Let. 29:2619-2622 (1988\n)). These chemistries can be performed by a variety of automated oligonucleotide synthesizers available in the market. Alternatively, CpGs can be produced on a large scale in plasmids, (see \nSambrook, T., et al., \"\nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,\n\" Cold Spring Harbor laboratory Press, New York, 1989\n) which after being administered to a subject are degraded into oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides can be prepared from existing nucleic acid sequences (e.g., genomic or cDNA) using known techniques, such as those employing restriction enzymes, exonucleases or endonucleases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe immunostimulatory substances, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids as well as the unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotide can be bound to the VLP by any way known is the art provided the composition enhances an immune response in an animal. For example, the oligonucleotide can be bound either covalently or non-covalently. In addition, the VLP can enclose, fully or partially, the immunostimulatory substances, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids as well as the unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotide. Preferably, the immunostimulatory nucleic acid as well as the unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotide can be bound to a VLP site such as an oligonucleotide binding site (either naturally or non-naturally occurring), a DNA binding site or a RNA binding site. In another embodiment, the VLP site comprises an arginine-rich repeat.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne specific use for the compositions of the invention is to activate dendritic cells for the purpose of enhancing a specific immune response against antigens. The immune response can be enhanced using ex vivo or in vivo techniques. The ex vivo procedure can be used on autologous or heterologous cells, but is preferably used on autologous cells. In preferred embodiments, the dendritic cells are isolated from peripheral blood or bone marrow, but can be isolated from any source of dendritic cells. Ex vivo manipulation of dendritic cells for the purposes of cancer immunotherapy have been described in several references in the art, including \nEngleman, E. G., Cytotechnology 25:1 (1997\n); \nVan Schooten, W., et al., Molecular Medicine Today, June, 255 (1997\n); \nSteinman, R. M., Experimental Hematology 24:849 (1996\n); and \nGluckman, J. C., Cytokines, Cellular and Molecular Therapy 3:187 (1997\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dendritic cells can also be contacted with the inventive compositions using in vivo methods. In order to accomplish this, the CpGs are administered in combination with the VLP optionally coupled, fused or otherwise attached to an antigen directly to a subject in need of immunotherapy. In some embodiments, it is preferred that the VLPs/CpGs be administered in the local region of the tumor, which can be accomplished in any way known in the art, e.g., direct injection into the tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventive composition can further comprise an antigen or antigenic determinant bound to the virus-like particle. The invention provides for compositions that vary according to the antigen or antigenic determinant selected in consideration of the desired therapeutic effect. Very preferred antigens or antigenic determinants suitable for use in the present invention are disclosed in \n \nWO 00/32227\n \n, in \n \nWO 01/85208\n \n and in \n \nWO 02/056905\n \n, the disclosures of which are herewith incorporated by reference in their entireties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antigen can be any antigen of known or yet unknown provenance. It can be isolated from bacteria, viruses or other pathogens or can be a recombinant antigen obtained from expression of suitable nucleic acid coding therefor. It can also be isolated from prions, tumors, self-molecules, non-peptidic hapten molecules, allergens and hormones. In a preferred embodiment, the antigen is a recombinant antigen. The selection of the antigen is, of course, dependent upon the immunological response desired and the host.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the immune enhancing composition of the present invention, the immune response is induced against the VLP itself. In another embodiment of the invention a virus-like particle is coupled, fused or otherwise attached to an antigen/immunogen against which an enhanced immune response is desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the at least one antigen or antigenic determinant is fused to the virus-like particle. As outlined above, a VLP is typically composed of at least one subunit assembling into a VLP. Thus, in again a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigen or antigenic determinant is fused to at least one subunit of the virus-like particle or of a protein capable of being incorporated into a VLP generating a chimeric VLP-subunit-antigen fusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusion of the antigen or antigenic determinant can be effected by insertion into the VLP subunit sequence, or by fusion to either the N- or C-terminus of the VLP-subunit or protein capable of being incorporated into a VLP. Hereinafter, when referring to fusion proteins of a peptide to a VLP subunit, the fusion to either ends of the subunit sequence or internal insertion of the peptide within the subunit sequence are encompassed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusion may also be effected by inserting antigen or antigenic determinant sequences into a variant of a VLP subunit where part of the subunit sequence has been deleted, that are further referred to as truncation mutants. Truncation mutants may have N- or C-terminal, or internal deletions of part of the sequence of the VLP subunit. For example, the specific VLP HBcAg with, for example, deletion of amino acid residues 79 to 81 is a truncation mutant with an internal deletion. Fusion of antigens or antigenic determinants to either the N- or C-terminus of the truncation mutants VLP-subunits also lead to embodiments of the invention. Likewise, fusion of an epitope into the sequence of the VLP subunit may also be effected by substitution, where for example for the specific VLP HBcAg, amino acids 79-81 are replaced with a foreign epitope. Thus, fusion, as referred to hereinafter, may be effected by insertion of the antigen or antigenic determinant sequence in the sequence of a VLP subunit, by substitution of part of the sequence of the VLP subunit with the antigen or antigenic determinant, or by a combination of deletion, substitution or insertions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chimeric antigen or antigenic determinant -VLP subunit will be in general capable of self-assembly into a VLP. VLP displaying epitopes fused to their subunits are also herein referred to as chimeric VLPs. As indicated, the virus-like particle comprises or alternatively is composed of at least one VLP subunit. In a further embodiment of the invention, the virus-like particle comprises or alternatively is composed of a mixture of chimeric VLP subunits and non-chimeric VLP subunits, i.e. VLP subunits not having an antigen fused thereto, leading to so called mosaic particles. This may be advantageous to ensure formation of, and assembly to a VLP. In those embodiments, the\n\n\n \n \n \n \nproportion of chimeric VLP-subunits may be 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95% or higher.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFlanking amino acid residues may be added to either end of the sequence of the peptide or epitope to be fused to either end of the sequence of the subunit of a VLP, or for internal insertion of such peptidic sequence into the sequence of the subunit of a VLP. Glycine and serine residues are particularly favored amino acids to be used in the flanking sequences added to the peptide to be fused. Glycine residues confer additional flexibility, which may diminish the potentially destabilizing effect of fusing a foreign sequence into the sequence of a VLP subunit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment of the invention, the VLP is a Hepatitis B core antigen VLP. Fusion proteins of the antigen or antigenic determinant to either the N-terminus of a HBcAg (\nNeyrinck, S. et al., Nature Med. 5:1157-1163 (1999\n)) or insertions in the so called major immunodominant region (MIR) have been described (\nPumpens, P. and Grens, E., Intervirology 44:98-114 (2001\n)), \n \nWO 01/98333\n \n), and are preferred embodiments of the invention. Naturally occurring variants of HBcAg with deletions in the MIR have also been described (\nPumpens, P. and Grens, E., Intervirology 44:98-114 (2001\n), which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety), and fusions to the N- or C-terminus, as well as insertions at the position of the MIR corresponding to the site of deletion as compared to a wt HBcAg are further embodiments of the invention. Fusions to the C-terminus have also been described (\nPumpens, P. and Grens, E., Intervirology 44:98-114 (2001\n)). One skilled in the art will easily find guidance on how to construct fusion proteins using classical molecular biology techniques (\nSambrook, J. et al., eds., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd. edition, Cold Spring Habor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989\n), \nHo et al., Gene 77:51 (1989\n)). Vectors and plasmids encoding HBcAg and HBcAg fusion proteins and useful for the expression of a HBcAg and HBcAg fusion proteins have been described (\nPumpens, P. & Grens, E. Intervirology 44: 98-114 (2001\n), \nNeyrinck, S. et al., Nature Med. 5:1157-1163 (1999\n)) and can be used in the practice of the invention. An important factor for the optimization of the efficiency of self-assembly and of the display of the epitope to be inserted in the MCR- of HBcAg is the choice of the insertion site, as well as the number of amino acids to be deleted from the HBcAg sequence within the MIR (\nPumpens, P. and Grens, E., Intervirology 44:98-114 (2001\n); \n \n \nEP\n 0 421 635\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,231,864\n \n) upon insertion, or in other words, which amino acids form HBcAg are to be substituted with the new epitope. For example, substitution of HBcAg amino acids 76-80, 79-81, 79-80, 75-85 or 80-81 with foreign epitopes has been described (\nPumpens, P. and Grens, E., Intervirology 44:98-114 (2001\n); \n \nEP0421635\n \n; \n \nUS 6,231,864\n \n). HBcAg contains a long arginine tail (\nPumpens, P. and Grens, E., Intervirology 44:98-114 (2001\n))which is dispensable for capsid assembly and capable of binding nucleic acids (\nPumpens, P. and Grens, E., Intervirology 44:98-114 (2001\n)). HBcAg either comprising or lacking this arginine tail are both embodiments of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the VLP is a VLP of a RNA phage. The major coat proteins of RNA phages spontaneously assemble into VLPs upon expression in bacteria, and in particular in \nE. coli.\n Specific examples of bacteriophage coat proteins which can be used to prepare compositions of the invention include the coat proteins of RNA bacteriophages such as bacteriophage Qβ (SEQ ID NO:10; PIR Database, Accession No. VCBPQβ referring to Qβ CP and SEQ ID NO: 11; Accession No. AAA16663 referring to Qβ A1 protein) and bacteriophage fr (SEQ ID NO: 13; PIR Accession No. VCBPFR).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a more preferred embodiment, the at least one antigen or antigenic determinant is fused to a Qβ coat protein. Fusion protein constructs wherein epitopes have been fused to the C-terminus of a truncated form of the A1 protein of Qβ, or inserted within the A1 protein have been described (\nKozlovska, T. M., et al., Intervirology, 39:9-15 (1996\n)). The A1 protein is generated by suppression at the UGA stop codon and has a length of 329 aa, or 328 aa, if the cleavage of the N-terminal methionine is taken into account. Cleavage of the N-terminal methionine before an alanine (the second amino acid encoded by the Qβ CP gene) usually takes place in \nE. coli,\n and such is the case for N-termini of the Qβ coat proteins. The part of the A1 gene, 3' of the UGA amber codon encodes the CP extension, which has a length of 195 amino acids. Insertion of the at least one antigen or antigenic determinant between position 72 and 73 of the CP extension leads to further embodiments of the invention (\nKozlovska, T. M., et al., Intervirology 39:9-15 (1996\n)). Fusion of an antigen or antigenic determinant at the C-terminus of a C-terminally truncated Qβ A1 protein leads to further preferred embodiments of the invention. For example, \nKozlovska et al., (Intervirology, 39: 9-15 (1996\n)) describe Qβ A1 protein fusions where the epitope is fused at the C-terminus of the Qβ CP extension truncated at \nposition\n 19.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described by \nKozlovska et al. (Intervirology, 39: 9-15 (1996\n)), assembly of the particles displaying the fused epitopes typically requires the presence of both the A1 protein-antigen fusion and the wt CP to form a mosaic particle. However, embodiments comprising virus-like particles, and hereby in particular the VLPs of the RNA phage Qβ coat protein, which are exclusively composed of VLP subunits having at least one antigen or antigenic determinant fused thereto, are also within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe production of mosaic particles may be effected in a number of ways. \nKozlovska et al., Intervirology, 39:9-15 (1996\n), describe three methods, which all can be used in the practice of the invention. In the first approach, efficient display of the fused epitope on the VLPs is mediated by the expression of the plasmid encoding the Qβ A1 protein fusion having a UGA stop codong between CP and CP extension in a E. coli strain harboring a plasmid encoding a cloned UGA suppressor tRNA which leads to translation of the UGA codon into Trp (pISM3001 plasmid (\nSmiley B.K., et al., Gene 134:33-40 (1993\n))). In another approach, the CP gene stop codon is modified into UAA, and a second plasmid expressing the A1 protein-antigen fusion is cotransformed. The second plasmid encodes a different antibiotic resistance and the origin of replication is compatible with the first plasmid (\nKozlovska, T. M., et al., Intervirology 39:9-15 (1996\n)). In a third approach, CP and the A1 protein-antigen fusion are encoded in a bicistronic manner, operatively linked to a promoter such as the Trp promoter, as described in \nFigure 1\n of \nKozlovska et al., Intervirology, 39:9-15 (1996\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, the antigen or antigenic determinant is inserted between \namino acid\n 2 and 3 (numbering of the cleaved CP, that is wherein the N-terminal methionine is cleaved) of the fr CP, thus leading to an antigen or antigenic determinant -fr CP fusion protein. Vectors and expression systems for construction and expression of fr CP fusion proteins self-assembling to VLP and useful in the practice of the invention have been described (\nPushko P. et al., Prot. Eng. 6:883-891 (1993\n)). In a specific embodiment, the antigen or antigenic determinant sequence is inserted into a deletion variant of the fr CP after \namino acid\n 2, wherein \n \nresidues\n \n 3 and 4 of the fr CP have been deleted (\nPushko P. et al., Prot. Eng. 6:883-891 (1993\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusion of epitopes in the N-terminal protuberant β-hairpin of the coat protein of RNA phage MS-2 and subsequent presentation of the fused epitope on the self-assembled VLP of RNA phage MS-2 has also been described (\n \nWO 92/13081\n \n), and fusion of an antigen or antigenic determinant by insertion or substitution into the coat protein of MS-2 RNA phage is also falling under the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the invention, the antigen or antigenic determinant is fused to a capsid protein of papillomavirus. In a more specific embodiment, the antigen or antigenic determinant is fused to the major capsid protein L1 of bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1). Vectors and expression systems for construction and expression of BPV-1 fusion proteins in a baculovirus/insect cells systems have been described (\nChackerian, B. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:2373-2378 (1999\n), \n \nWO 00/23955\n \n). Substitution of amino acids 130-136 of BPV-1 L1 with an antigen or antigenic determinant leads to a BPV-1 L1-antigen fusion protein, which is a preferred embodiment of the invention. Cloning in a baculovirus vector and expression in baculovirus infected Sf9 cells has been described, and can be used in the practice of the invention (\nChackerian, B. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:2373-2378 (1999\n), \n \nWO 00/23955\n \n). Purification of the assembled particles displaying the fused antigen or antigenic determinant can be performed in a number of ways, such as for example gel filtration or sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (\nChackerian, B. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:2373-2378 (1999\n), \n \nWO 00/23955\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment of the invention, the antigen or antigenic determinant is fused to a Ty protein capable of being incorporated into a Ty VLP. In a more specific embodiment, the antigen or antigenic determinant is fused to the p1 or capsid protein encoded by the TYA gene (\nRoth, J.F., Yeast 16:785-795 (2000\n)). The yeast retrotransposons Ty1, 2, 3 and 4 have been isolated from \nSaccharomyces Serevisiae,\n while the retrotransposon Tfl has been isolated from Schizosaccharomyces Pombae (\nBoeke, J.D. and Sandmeyer, S.B., \"\nYeast Transposable elements,\n\" in The molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genome dynamics, Protein Synthesis, and Energetics, p. 193, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1991\n)). The retrotransposons Ty1 and 2 are related to the \ncopia\n class of plant and animal elements, while Ty3 belongs to the \ngypsy\n family of retrotransposons, which is related to plants and animal retroviruses. In the Ty1 retrotransposon, the p1 protein, also referred to as Gag or capsid protein, has a length of 440 amino acids. P1 is cleaved during maturation of the VLP at position 408, leading to the p2 protein, the essential component of the VLP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusion proteins to p1 and vectors for the expression of said fusion proteins in Yeast have been described (\nAdams, S.E., et al., Nature 329:68-70 (1987\n)). So, for example, an antigen or antigenic determinant may be fused to p1 by inserting a sequence coding for the antigen or antigenic determinant into the BamH1 site of the pMA5620 plasmid (\nAdams, S.E., et al., Nature 329:68-70 (1987\n)). The cloning of sequences coding for foreign epitopes into the pMA5620 vector leads to expression of fusion proteins comprising amino acids 1-381 of p1 of Ty1-15, fused C-terminally to the N-terminus of the foreign epitope. Likewise, N-terminal fusion of an antigen or antigenic determinant, or internal insertion into the p1 sequence, or substitution of part of the p1 sequence are also meant to fall within the scope of the invention. In particular, insertion of an antigen or antigenic determinant into the Ty sequence between amino acids 30-31, 67-68, 113-114 and 132-133 of the Ty protein p1 (\n \nEP0677111\n \n) leads to preferred embodiments of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther VLPs suitable for fusion of antigens or antigenic determinants are, for example, Retrovirus-like-particles (\n \nWO9630523\n \n), HIV2 Gag (\nKang, Y.C., et al, Biol. Chem. 380:353-364 (1999\n)), Cowpea Mosaic Virus (\nTaylor, K.M.et al., Biol. Chem. 380:387-392 (1999\n)), parvovirus VP2 VLP (\nRueda, P. et al., Virology 263:89-99 (1999\n)), HBsAg (\n \nUS 4,722,840\n \n, \n \nEP0020416B1\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of chimeric VLPs suitable for the practice of the invention are also those described in \nIntervirology 39:1 (1996\n). Further examples of VLPs contemplated for use in the invention are: HPV-1, HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-33, HPV-45, CRPV, COPV, HIV GAG, Tobacco Mosaic Virus. Virus-like particles of SV-40, Polyomavirus, Adenovirus, Herpes Simplex Virus, Rotavirus and Norwalk virus have also been made, and chimeric VLPs of those VLPs comprising an antigen or antigenic determinant are also within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs indicated, embodiments comprising antigens fused to the virus-like particle by insertion within the sequence of the virus-like particle building monomer are also within the scope of the present invention. In some cases, antigens can be inserted in a form of the virus-like particle building monomer containing deletions. In these cases, the virus-like particle building monomer may not be able to form virus-like structures in the absence of the inserted antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some instances, recombinant DNA technology can be utilized to fuse a heterologous protein to a VLP protein (\nKratz, P.A., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:1915 (1999\n)). For example, the present invention encompasses VLPs recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated (including both covalently and non-covalently conjugations) to an antigen (or portion thereof, preferably at least 10, 20 or 50 amino acids) of the present invention to generate fusion proteins or conjugates. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but can occur through linker sequences. More generally, in the case that epitopes, either fused, conjugated or otherwise attached to the virus-like particle, are used as antigens in accordance with the invention, spacer or linker sequences are typically added at one or both ends of the epitopes. Such linker sequences preferably comprise sequences recognized by the proteasome, proteases of the endosomes or other vesicular compartment of the cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne way of coupling is by a peptide bond, in which the conjugate can be a contiguous polypeptide, \ni.e\n. a fusion protein. In a fusion protein according to the present invention, different peptides or polypeptides are linked in frame to each other to form a contiguous polypeptide. Thus a first portion of the fusion protein comprises an antigen or immunogen and a second portion of the fusion protein, either N-terminal or C-terminal to the first portion, comprises a VLP. Alternatively, internal insertion into the VLP, with optional linking sequences on both ends of the antigen, can also be used in accordance with the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen HBcAg is used as the VLP, it is preferred that the antigen is linked to the C-terminal end of the HBcAg particle. The hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) exhibiting a C-terminal fusion of the MHC class I restricted peptide p33 derived from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) glycoprotein was used as a model antigen (HBcAg-p33). The 185 amino acids long wild type HBc protein assembles into highly structured particles composed of 180 subunits assuming icosahedral geometry. The flexibility of the HBcAg and other VLPs in accepting relatively large insertions of foreign sequences at different positions while retaining the capacity to form structured capsids is well documented in the literature. This makes the HBc VLPs attractive candidates for the design of non-replicating vaccines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA flexible linker sequence (\ne.g\n. a polyglycine/polyserine-containing sequence such as [Gly\n4\n Ser]\n2\n (Huston \net al., Meth. Enzymol 203\n:4.6-88 (1991)) can be inserted into the fusion protein between the antigen and ligand. Also, the fusion protein can be constructed to contain an \"epitope tag\", which allows the fusion protein to bind an antibody (e.g. monoclonal antibody) for example for labeling or purification purposes. An example of an epitope tag is a Glu-Glu-Phe tripeptide which is recognized by the monoclonal antibody YL1/2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to the chimeric DNA which contains a sequence coding for the VLP and a sequence coding for the antigen/immunogen. The DNA can be expressed, for example, in insect cells transformed with Baculoviruses, in yeast or in bacteria. There are no restrictions regarding the expression system, of which a large selection is available for routine use. Preferably, a system is used which allows expression of the proteins in large amounts. In general, bacterial expression systems are preferred on account of their efficiency. One example of a bacterial expression system suitable for use within the scope of the present invention is the one described by \nClarke et al., J. Gen. Virol. 71: 1109-1117 (1990\n); \nBorisova et al., J. Virol. 67: 3696-3701 (1993\n); and \nStudier et al., Methods Enzymol. 185:60-89 (1990\n). An example of a suitable yeast expression system is the one described by \nEmr, Methods Enzymol. 185:231-3 (1990\n); Baculovirus systems, which have previously been used for preparing capsid proteins, are also suitable. Constitutive or inducible expression systems can be used. By the choice and possible modification of available expression systems it is possible to control the form in which the proteins are obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment of the invention, the antigen to which an enhanced immune response is desired is coupled, fused or otherwise attached in frame to the Hepatitis B virus capsid (core) protein (HBcAg). However, it will be clear to all individuals in the art that other virus-like particles can be utilized in the fusion protein construct of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the at least one antigen or antigenic determinant is bound to the virus-like particle by at least one covalent bond. Preferably, the least one antigen or antigenic determinant is bound to the virus-like particle by at least one covalent bond, said covalent bond being a non-peptide bond leading to an antigen or antigenic determinant array and antigen or antigenic determinant -VLP conjugate, respectively. This antigen or antigenic determinant array and conjugate, respectively, has typically and preferably a repetitive and ordered structure since the at least one antigen or antigenic determinant is bound to the VLP in an oriented manner. The formation of a repetitive and ordered antigen or antigenic determinant -VLP array and conjugate, respectively, is ensured by an oriented and directed as well as defined binding and attachment, respectively, of the at least one antigen or antigenic determinant to the VLP as will become apparent in the following. Furthermore, the typical inherent highly repetitive and organized structure of the VLPs advantageously contributes to the display of the antigen or antigenic determinant in a highly ordered and repetitive fashion leading to a highly organized and repetitive antigen or antigenic determinant -VLP array and conjugate, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, the preferred inventive conjugates and arrays, respectively, differ from prior art conjugates in their highly organized structure, dimensions, and in the repetitiveness of the antigen on the surface of the array. The preferred embodiment of this invention, furthermore, allows expression of the particle in an expression host guaranteeing proper folding and assembly of the VLP, to which the antigen is then further coupled\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention discloses methods of binding of antigen or antigenic determinant to VLPs. As indicated, in one aspect of the invention, the at least one antigen or antigenic determinant is bound to the VLP by way of chemical cross-linking, typically and preferably by using a heterobifunctional cross-linker. Several hetero-bifunctional cross-linkers are known to the art. In preferred embodiments, the hetero-bifunctional cross-linker contains a functional group which can react with preferred first attachment sites, i.e, with the side-chain amino group of lysine residues of the VLP or at least one VLP subunit, and a further functional group which can react with a preferred second attachment site, i.e. a cysteine residue fused to the antigen or antigenic determinant and optionally also made available for reaction by reduction. The first step of the procedure, typically called the derivatization, is the reaction of the VLP with the cross-linker. The product of this reaction is an activated VLP, also called activated carrier. In the second step, unreacted cross-linker is removed using usual methods such as gel filtration or dialysis. In the third step, the antigen or antigenic determinant is reacted with the activated VLP, and this step is typically called the coupling step. Unreacted antigen or antigenic determinant may be optionally removed in a fourth step, for example by dialysis. Several hetero-bifunctional cross-linkers are known to the art. These include the preferred cross-linkers SMPH (Pierce), Sulfo-MBS, Sulfo-EMCS, Sulfo-GMBS, Sulfo-SIAB, Sulfo-SMPB, Sulfo-SMCC, SVSB, SIA and other cross-linkers available for example from the Pierce Chemical Company (Rockford, IL, USA), and having one functional group reactive towards amino groups and one functional group reactive towards cysteine residues. The above mentioned cross-linkers all lead to formation of a thioether linkage. Another class of cross-linkers suitable in the practice of the invention is characterized by the introduction of a disulfide linkage between the antigen or antigenic determinant and the VLP upon coupling. Preferred cross-linkers belonging to this class include for example SPDP and Sulfo-LC-SPDP (Pierce). The extent of derivatization of the VLP with cross-linker can be influenced by varying experimental conditions such as the concentration of each of the reaction partners, the excess of one reagent over the other, the pH, the temperature and the ionic strength. The degree of coupling, i.e. the amount of antigens or antigenic determinants per subunits of the VLP can be adjusted by varying the experimental conditions described above to match the requirements of the vaccine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA particularly favored method of binding of antigens or antigenic determinants to the VLP, is the linking of a lysine residue on the surface of the VLP with a cysteine residue on the antigen or antigenic determinant. In some embodiments, fusion of an amino acid linker containing a cysteine residue, as a second attachment site or as a part thereof, to the antigen or antigenic determinant for coupling to the VLP may be required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, flexible amino acid linkers are favored. Examples of the amino acid linker are selected from the group consisting of: (a) CGG; (b) N-terminal gamma 1-linker; (c) N-terminal gamma 3-linker; (d) Ig hinge regions; (e) N-terminal glycine linkers; (f) (G)\nk\nC(G)\nn\n with n=0-12 and k=0-5; (g) N-terminal glycine-serine linkers; (h) (G)\nk\nC(G)\nm\n(S)\nl\n(GGGGS)\nn\n with n=0-3, k=0-5, m=0-10, 1=0-2; (i) GGC; (k) GGC-NH2; (l) C-terminal gamma 1-linker; (m) C-terminal gamma 3-linker; (n) C-terminal glycine linkers; (o) (G)\nn\nC(G)\nk\n with n=0-12 and k=0-5; (p) C-terminal glycine-serine linkers; (q) (G)\nm\n(S)\nl\n(GGGGS)\nn\n(G)\no\nC(G)\nk\n with n=0-3, k=0-5, m=0-10, 1=0-2, and o=0-8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther examples of amino acid linkers are the hinge region of Immunoglobulins, glycine serine linkers (GGGGS)\nn\n, and glycine linkers (G)\nn\n all further containing a cysteine residue as second attachment site and optionally further glycine residues. Typically preferred examples of said amino acid linkers are N-terminal gamma1: CGDKTHTSPP; C-terminal gamma 1: DKTHTSPPCG; N-terminal gamma 3: CGGPKPSTPPGSSGGAP; C-terminal gamma 3: PKPSTPPGSSGGAPGGCG; N-terminal glycine linker: GCGGGG and C-terminal glycine linker: GGGGCG.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther amino acid linkers particularly suitable in the practice of the invention, when a hydrophobic antigen or antigenic determinant is bound to a VLP, are CGKKGG, or CGDEGG for N-terminal linkers, or GGKKGC and GGEDGC, for the C-terminal linkers. For the C-terminal linkers, the terminal cysteine is optionally C-terminally amidated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments of the present invention, GGCG, GGC or GGC-NH2 (\"NH2\" stands for amidation) linkers at the C-terminus of the peptide or CGG at its N-terminus are preferred as amino acid linkers. In general, glycine residues will be inserted between bulky amino acids and the cysteine to be used as second attachment site, to avoid potential steric hindrance of the bulkier amino acid in the coupling reaction. In the most preferred embodiment of the invention, the amino acid linker GGC-NH2 is fused to the C-terminus of the antigen or antigenic determinant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cysteine residue present on the antigen or antigenic determinant has to be in its reduced state to react with the hetero-bifunctional cross-linker on the activated VLP, that is a free cysteine or a cysteine residue with a free sulfhydryl group has to be available. In the instance where the cysteine residue to function as binding site is in an oxidized form, for example if it is forming a disulfide bridge, reduction of this disulfide bridge with e.g: DTT, TCEP or β-mercaptoethanol is required. Low concentrations of reducing agent are compatible with coupling as described in \n \nWO 02/05690\n \n, higher concentrations inhibit the coupling reaction, as a skilled artisan would know, in which case the reductand has to be removed or its concentration decreased prior to coupling, e.g. by dialysis, gel filtration or reverse phase HPLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding of the antigen or antigenic determinant to the VLP by using a hetero-bifunctional cross-linker according to the preferred methods described above, allows coupling of the antigen or antigenic determinant to the VLP in an oriented fashion. Other methods of binding the antigen or antigenic determinant to the VLP include methods wherein the antigen or antigenic determinant is cross-linked to the VLP using the carbodiimide EDC, and NHS. In further methods, the antigen or antigenic determinant is attached to the VLP using a homo-bifunctional cross-linker such as glutaraldehyde, DSG, BM[PEO]\n4\n, BS\n3\n, (Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL, USA) or other known homo-bifunctional cross-linkers whith functional groups reactive towards amine groups or carboxyl groups of the VLP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther methods of binding the VLP to an antigen or antigenic determinant include methods where the VLP is biotinylated, and the antigen or antigenic determinant expressed as a streptavidin-fusion protein, or methods wherein both the antigen or antigenic determinant and the VLP are biotinylated, for example as described in \n \nWO 00/23955\n \n. In this case, the antigen or antigenic determinant may be first bound to streptavidin or avidin by adjusting the ratio of antigen or antigenic determinant to streptavidin such that free binding sites are still available for binding of the VLP, which is added in the next step. Alternatively, all components may be mixed in a \"one pot\" reaction. Other ligand-receptor pairs, where a soluble form of the receptor and of the ligand is available, and are capable of being cross-linked to the VLP or the antigen or antigenic determinant, may be used as binding agents for binding antigen or antigenic determinant to the VLP. Alternatively, either the ligand or the receptor may be fused to the antigen or antigenic determinant, and so mediate binding to the VLP chemically bound or fused either to the receptor, or the ligand respectively. Fusion may also be effected by insertion or substitution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs already indicated, in a favored embodiment of the present invention, the VLP is the VLP of a RNA phage, and in a more preferred embodiment, the VLP is the VLP of RNA phage Qβ coat protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or several antigen molecules, i.e. one or several antigens or antigenic determinants, can be attached to one subunit of the capsid or VLP of RNA phages coat proteins, preferably through the exposed lysine residues of the VLP of RNA phages, if sterically allowable. A specific feature of the VLP of the coat protein of RNA phages and in particular of the Qβ coat protein VLP is thus the possibility to couple several antigens per subunit. This allows for the generation of a dense antigen array.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment of the invention, the binding and attachment, respectively, of the at least one antigen or antigenic determinant to the virus-like particle is by way of interaction and association, respectively, between at least one first attachment site of the virus-like particle and at least one second attachment of the antigen or antigenic determinant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVLPs or capsids of Qβ coat protein display a defined number of lysine residues on their surface, with a defined topology with three lysine residues pointing towards the interior of the capsid and interacting with the RNA, and four other lysine residues exposed to the exterior of the capsid. These defined properties favor the attachment of antigens to the exterior of the particle, rather than to the interior of the particle where the lysine residues interact with RNA. VLPs of other RNA phage coat proteins also have a defined number of lysine residues on their surface and a defined topology of these lysine residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further preferred embodiments of the present invention, the first attachment site is a lysine residue and/or the second attachment comprises sulfhydryl group or a cysteine residue. In a very preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first attachment site is a lysine residue and the second attachment is a cysteine residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn very preferred embodiments of the invention, the antigen or antigenic determinant is bound via a cysteine residue, to lysine residues of the VLP of RNA phage coat protein, and in particular to the VLP of Qβ coat protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother advantage of the VLPs derived from RNA phages is their high expression yield in bacteria that allows production of large quantities of material at affordable cost.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs indicated, the inventive conjugates and arrays, respectively, differ from prior art conjugates in their highly organized structure, dimensions, and in the repetitiveness of the antigen on the surface of the array. Moreover, the use of the VLPs as carriers allow the formation of robust antigen arrays and conjugates, respectively, with variable antigen density. In particular, the use of VLPs of RNA phages, and hereby in particular the use of the VLP of RNA phage Qβ coat protein allows to achieve very high epitope density. In particular, a density of more than 1.5 epitopes per subunit could be reached by coupling the human Aβ1-6 peptide to the VLP of Qβ coat protein. The preparation of compositions of VLPs of RNA phage coat proteins with a high epitope density can be effected using the teaching of this application. In prefered embodiment of the invention, when an antigen or antigenic determinant is coupled to the VLP of Qβ coat protein, an average number of antigen or antigenic determinant per subunit of 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 , 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, or higher is preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe second attachment site, as defined herein, may be either naturally or non-naturally present with the antigen or the antigenic determinant. In the case of the absence of a suitable natural occurring second attachment site on the antigen or antigenic determinant, such a, then non-natural second attachment has to be engineered to the antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, four lysine residues are exposed on the surface of the VLP of Qβ coat protein. Typically these residues are derivatized upon reaction with a cross-linker molecule. In the instance where not all of the exposed lysine residues can be coupled to an antigen, the lysine resides which have reacted with the cross-linker are left with a cross-linker molecule attached to the ε-amino group after the derivatization step. This leads to disappearance of one or several positive charges, which may be detrimental to the solubility and stability of the VLP. By replacing some of the lysine residues with arginines, as in the disclosed Qβ coat protein mutants described below, we prevent the excessive disappearance of positive charges since the arginine residues do not react with the cross-linker. Moreover, replacement of lysine residues by arginines may lead to more defined antigen arrays, as fewer sites are available for reaction to the antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, exposed lysine residues were replaced by arginines in the following Qβ coat protein mutants and mutant Qβ VLPs disclosed in this application: Qβ-240 (Lys13-Arg; SEQ ID NO:23), Qβ-250 (Lys 2-Arg, Lys13-Arg; SEQ ID NO: 25) and Qβ-259 (Lys 2-Arg, Lys16-Arg; SEQ ID NO:27). The constructs were cloned, the proteins expressed, the VLPs purified and used for coupling to peptide and protein antigens. Qβ-251 ; (SEQ ID NO: 26) was also constructed, and guidance on how to express, purify and couple the VLP of Qβ-251 coat protein can be found throughout the application.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, we disclose a Qβ mutant coat protein with one additional lysine residue, suitable for obtaining even higher density arrays of antigens. This mutant Qβ coat protein, Qβ-243 (Asn 10-Lys; SEQ ID NO: 24), was cloned, the protein expressed, and the capsid or VLP isolated and purified, showing that introduction of the additional lysine residue is compatible with self-assembly of the subunits to a capsid or VLP. Thus, antigen or antigenic determinant arrays and conjugates, respectively, may be prepared using VLP of Qβ coat protein mutants. A particularly favored method of attachment of antigens to VLPs, and in particular to VLPs of RNA phage coat proteins is the linking of a lysine residue present on the surface of the VLP of RNA phage coat proteins with a cysteine residue added to the antigen. In order for a cysteine residue to be effective as second attachment site, a sulfhydryl group must be available for coupling. Thus, a cysteine residue has to be in its reduced state, that is, a free cysteine or a cysteine residue with a free sulfhydryl group has to be available. In the instant where the cysteine residue to function as second attachment site is in an oxidized form, for example if it is forming a disulfide bridge, reduction of this disulfide bridge with \ne.g\n. DTT, TCEP or β-mercaptoethanol is required. The concentration of reductand, and the molar excess of reductand over antigen has to be adjusted for each antigen. A titration range, starting from concentrations as low as 10 µM or lower, up to 10 to 20 mM or higher reductand if required is tested, and coupling of the antigen to the carrier assessed. Although low concentrations of reductand are compatible with the coupling reaction as described in \n \nWO 02/056905\n \n, higher concentrations inhibit the coupling reaction, as a skilled artisan would know, in which case the reductand has to be removed or its concentration decreased, e.g. by dialysis, gel filtration or reverse phase HPLC . Advantageously, the pH of the dialysis or equilibration buffer is lower than 7, preferably 6. The compatibility of the low pH buffer with antigen activity or stability has to be tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEpitope density on the VLP of RNA phage coat proteins can be modulated by the choice of cross-linker and other reaction conditions. For example, the cross-linkers Sulfo-GMBS and SMPH typically allow reaching high epitope density. Derivatization is positively influenced by high concentration of reactands, and manipulation of the reaction conditions can be used to control the number of antigens coupled to VLPs of RNA phage coat proteins, and in particular to VLPs of Qβ coat protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to the design of a non-natural second attachment site the position at which it should be fused, inserted or generally engineered has to be chosen. The selection of the position of the second attachment site may, by way of example, be based on a crystal structure of the antigen. Such a crystal structure of the antigen may provide information on the availability of the C- or N-termini of the molecule (determined for example from their accessibility to solvent), or on the exposure to solvent of residues suitable for use as second attachment sites, such as cysteine residues. Exposed disulfide bridges, as is the case for Fab fragments, may also be a source of a second attachment site, since they can be generally converted to single cysteine residues through mild reduction, with e.g. 2-mercaptoethylamine, TCEP, β-mercaptoethanol or DTT. Mild reduction conditions not affecting the immunogenicity of the antigen will be chosen. In general, in the case where immunization with a self-antigen is aiming at inhibiting, the interaction of this self-antigen with its natural ligands, the second attachment site will be added such that it allows generation of antibodies against the site of interaction with the natural ligands. Thus, the location of the second attachment site will be selected such that steric hindrance from the second attachment site or any amino acid linker containing the same is avoided. In further embodiments, an antibody response directed at a site distinct from the interaction site of the self-antigen with its natural ligand is desired. In such embodiments, the second attachment site may be selected such that it prevents generation of antibodies against the interaction site of the self antigen with its natural ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther criteria in selecting the position of the second attachment site include the oligomerization state of the antigen, the site of oligomerization, the presence of a cofactor, and the availability of experimental evidence disclosing sites in the antigen structure and sequence where modification of the antigen is compatible with the function of the self-antigen, or with the generation of antibodies recognizing the self-antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn very preferred embodiments, the antigen or antigenic determinant comprises a single second attachment site or a single reactive attachment site capable of association with the first attachment sites on the core particle and the VLPs or VLP subunits, respectively. This further ensures a defined and uniform binding and association, respectively, of the at least one, but typically more than one, preferably more than 10, 20, 40, 80, 120 antigens to the core particle and VLP, respectively. The provision of a single second attachment site or a single reactive attachment site on the antigen, thus, ensures a single and uniform type of binding and association, respectively leading to a very highly ordered and repetitive array. For example, if the binding and association, respectively, is effected by way of a lysine- (as the first attachment site) and cysteine- (as a second attachment site) interaction, it is ensured, in accordance with this preferred embodiment of the invention, that only one cysteine residue per antigen, independent whether this cysteine residue is naturally or non-naturally present on the antigen, is capable of binding and associating, respectively, with the VLP and the first attachment site of the core particle, respectively..\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, engineering of a second attachment site onto the antigen require the fusion of an amino acid linker containing an amino acid suitable as second attachment site according to the disclosures of this invention. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an amino acid linker is bound to the antigen or the antigenic determinant by way of at least one covalent bond. Preferably, the amino acid linker comprises, or alternatively consists of, the second attachment site. In a further preferred embodiment, the amino acid linker comprises a sulfhydryl group or a cysteine residue. In another preferred embodiment, the amino acid linker is cysteine. Some criteria of selection of the amino acid linker as well as further preferred embodiments of the amino acid linker according to the invention have already been mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another specific embodiment of the invention, the attachment site is selected to be a lysine or cysteine residue that is fused in frame to the HBcAg. In a preferred embodiment, the antigen is fused to the C-terminus of HBcAg via a three leucine linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen an antigen or antigenic determinant is linked to the VLP through a lysine residue, it may be advantageous to either substitute or delete one or more of the naturally resident lysine residues, as well as other lysine residues present in HBcAg variants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn many instances, when the naturally resident lysine residues are eliminated, another lysine will be introduced into the HBcAg as an attachment site for an antigen or antigenic determinant. Methods for inserting such a lysine residue are known in the art. Lysine residues may also be added without removing existing lysine residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe C-terminus of the HBcAg has been shown to direct nuclear localization of this protein. (\nEckhardt et al., J. Virol. 65:575-582 (1991\n)). Further, this region of the protein is also believed to confer upon the HBcAg the ability to bind nucleic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs indicated, HBcAgs suitable for use in the practice of the present invention also include N-tenninal truncation mutants. Suitable truncation mutants include modified HBcAgs where 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, or 17 amino acids have been removed from the N-terminus. However, variants of virus-like particles containing internal deletions within the sequence of the subunit composing the virus-like particle are also suitable in accordance with the present invention, provided their compatibility with the ordered or particulate structure of the virus-like particle. For example, internal deletions within the sequence of the HBcAg are suitable (\nPreikschat, P., et al., J. Gen. Virol. 80:1777-1788 (1999\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther HBcAgs suitable for use in the practice of the present invention include N- and C-terminal truncation mutants. Suitable truncation mutants include HBcAgs where 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, and 17 amino acids have been removed from the N-terminus and 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 40, 41, 42 or 48 amino acids have been removed from the C-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVaccine compositions of the invention can comprise mixtures of different HBcAgs. Thus, these vaccine compositions can be composed of HBcAgs which differ in amino acid sequence. For example, vaccine compositions could be prepared comprising a \"wild-type\" HBcAg and a modified HBcAg in which one or more amino acid residues have been altered (\ne.g\n., deleted, inserted or substituted). In most applications, however, only one type of a HBcAg will be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is applicable to a wide variety of antigens. In a preferred embodiment, the antigen is a protein, polypeptide or peptide. In another embodiment the antigen is DNA. The antigen can also be a lipid, a carbohydrate, or an organic molecule, in particular a small organic molecule such as nicotine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigens of the invention can be selected from the group consisting of the following: (a) polypeptides suited to induce an immune response against cancer cells; (b) polypeptides suited to induce an immune response against infectious diseases; (c) polypeptides suited to induce an immune response against allergens; (d) polypeptides suited to induce an immune response in farm animals or pets; and (e) fragments (\ne.g.\n, a domain) of any of the polypeptides set out in (a)-(d).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred antigens include those from a pathogen (\ne.g.\n virus, bacterium, parasite, fungus) and tumors (especially tumor-associated antigens or \"tumor markers\"). Other preferred antigens are autoantigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the specific embodiments described in the Examples, the antigen is the peptide p33 derived from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). The p33 peptide represents one of the best studied CTL epitopes (\nPircher et al., \"\nTolerance induction in double specific T-cell receptor transgenic mice varies with antigen,\n\" Nature 342:559 (1989\n); \nTissot et al., \"\nCharacterizing the functionality of recombinant T-cell receptors in vitro: a pMHC tetramer based approach,\n\" J Immunol Methods 236:147 (2000\n); \nBachmann et al., \"\nFour types of Ca2+-signals after stimulation of naive T cells with T cell agonists, partial agonists and antagonists,\n\"Eur.

Exp. Med. 186:645 (1997\n)). This specific epitope, therefore, is particularly well suited to study autoimmunity, tumor immunology as well as viral diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific embodiment of the invention, the antigen or antigenic determinant is one that is useful for the prevention of infectious disease. Such treatment will be useful to treat a wide variety of infectious diseases affecting a wide range of hosts, \ne.g\n., human, cow, sheep, pig, dog, cat, other mammalian species and non-mammalian species as well. Treatable infectious diseases are well known to those skilled in the art, and examples include infections of viral etiology such as HIV, influenza, \nHerpes,\n viral hepatitis, Epstein Bar, polio, viral encephalitis, measles, chicken pox, Papilloma virus etc.; or infections of bacterial etiology such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, syphilis, etc.; or infections of parasitic etiology such as malaria, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, trichomoniasis, amoebiasis, etc. Thus, antigens or antigenic determinants selected for the compositions of the invention will be well known to those in the medical art; examples of antigens or antigenic determinants include the following: the HIV antigens gp140 and gp160; the influenza antigens hemagglutinin, M2 protein and neuraminidase, Hepatitis B surface antigen or core and circumsporozoite protein of malaria or fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed above, antigens include infectious microbes such as viruses, bacteria and fungi and fragments thereof, derived from natural sources or synthetically. Infectious viruses of both human and non-human vertebrates include retroviruses, RNA viruses and DNA viruses. The group of retroviruses includes both simple retroviruses and complex retroviruses. The simple retroviruses include the subgroups of B-type retroviruses, C-type retroviruses and D-type retroviruses. An example of a B-type retrovirus is mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). The C-type retroviruses include subgroups C-type group A (including Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), avian leukemia virus (ALV), and avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) and C-type group B (including murine leukemia virus (MLV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), murine sarcoma virus (MSV), gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV), spleen necrosis virus (SNV), reticuloendotheliosis virus (RV) and simian sarcoma virus (SSV)). The D-type retroviruses include Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) and simian retrovirus type 1 (SRV-1). The complex retroviruses include the subgroups of lentiviruses, T-cell leukemia viruses and the foamy viruses. Lentiviruses include HIV-1, but also include HIV-2, SIV, Visna virus, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). The T-cell leukemia viruses include HTLV-1, HTLV-II, simian T-cell leukemia virus (STLV), and bovine leukemia virus (BLV). The foamy viruses include human foamy virus (HFV), simian foamy virus (SFV) and bovine foamy virus (BFV).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of RNA viruses that are antigens in vertebrate animals include, but are not limited to, the following: members of the family Reoviridae, including the genus Orthoreovirus (multiple serotypes of both mammalian and avian retroviruses), the genus Orbivirus (Bluetongue virus, Eugenangee virus, Kemerovo virus, African horse sickness virus, and Colorado Tick Fever virus), the genus Rotavirus (human rotavirus, Nebraska calf diarrhea virus, murine rotavirus, simian rotavirus, bovine or ovine rotavirus, avian rotavirus);

Finally, DNA viruses may include viruses which do not fit into the above families such as Kurn and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease viruses and chronic infectious neuropathic agents (CHINA virus).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the foregoing lists is illustrative, and is not intended to be limiting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment of the invention, the antigen comprises one or more cytotoxic T cell epitopes, Th cell epitopes, or a combination of the two epitopes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to enhancing an antigen specific immune response in humans, the methods of the preferred embodiments are particularly well suited for treatment of other mammals or other animals, \ne\n.\ng\n., birds such as hens, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, quail and pheasant. Birds are prime targets for many types of infections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn example of a common infection in chickens is chicken infectious anemia virus (CIAV). CLAV was first isolated in Japan in 1979 during an investigation of a Marek's disease vaccination break (\nYuasa et al., Avian Dis. 23:366-385 (1979\n)). Since that time, CIAV has been detected in commercial poultry in all major poultry producing countries (\nvan Bulow et al., pp. 690-699 in \"\nDiseases of Poultry\n\", 9th edition, Iowa State University Press 1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVaccination of birds, like other vertebrate animals can be performed at any age. Normally, vaccinations are performed at up to 12 weeks of age for a live microorganism and between 14-18 weeks for an inactivated microorganism or other type of vaccine. For in ovo vaccination, vaccination can be performed in the last quarter of embryo development. The vaccine can be administered subcutaneously, by spray, orally, intraocularly, intratracheally, nasally, in ovo or by other methods described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCattle and livestock are also susceptible to infection. Disease which affect these animals can produce severe economic losses, especially amongst cattle. The methods of the invention can be used to protect against infection in livestock, such as cows, horses, pigs, sheep and goats.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCows can be infected by bovine viruses. Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a small enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus and is classified, along with hog cholera virus (HOCV) and sheep border disease virus (BDV), in the pestivirus genus. Although Pestiviruses were previously classified in the Togaviridae family, some studies have suggested their reclassification within the Flaviviridae family along with the flavivirus and hepatitis C virus (HCV) groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEquine herpesviruses (EHV) comprise a group of antigenically distinct biological agents which cause a variety of infections in horses ranging from subclinical to fatal disease. These include Equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), a ubiquitous pathogen in horses. EHV-1 is associated with epidemics of abortion, respiratory tract disease, and central nervous system disorders. Other EHV's include EHV-2, or equine cytomegalovirus, EHV-3, equine coital exanthema virus, and EHV-4, previously classified as EHV-1 \nsubtype\n 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSheep and goats can be infected by a variety of dangerous microorganisms including visna-maedi.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimates such as monkeys, apes and macaques can be infected by simian immunodeficiency virus. Inactivated cell-virus and cell-free whole simian immunodeficiency vaccines have been reported to afford protection in macaques (\nStott et al., Lancet 36:1538-1541 (1990\n); \nDesrosiers et al., PNAS USA 86:6353-6357 (1989\n); \nMurphey-Corb et al., Science 246:1293-1297 (1989\n); and \nCarlson et al., AIDS Res. Human Retroviruses 6:1239-1246 (1990\n)). A recombinant HIV gp120 vaccine has been reported to afford protection in chimpanzees (\nBerman et al., Nature 345:622-625 (1990\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCats, both domestic and wild, are susceptible to infection with a variety of microorganisms. For instance, feline infectious peritonitis is a disease which occurs in both domestic and wild cats, such as lions, leopards, cheetahs, and jaguars. When it is desirable to prevent infection with this and other types of pathogenic organisms in cats, the methods of the invention can be used to vaccinate cats to prevent them against infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDomestic cats may become infected with several retroviruses, including but not limited to feline leukemia \nvirus\n (FeLV), feline sarcoma virus (FeSV), endogenous type C oncomavirus (RD-114), and feline syncytiaforming \nvirus\n (FeSFV). The discovery of feline T-lymphotropic lentivirus (also referred to as feline immunodeficiency) was first reported in \nPedersen et al., Science 235:790-793 (1987\n). Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a sporadic disease occurring unpredictably in domestic and wild Felidae. While FIP is primarily a disease of domestic cats, it has been diagnosed in lions, mountain lions, leopards, cheetahs, and the jaguar. Smaller wild cats that have been afflicted with FIP include the lynx and caracal, sand cat and pallas cat.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nViral and bacterial diseases in fin-fish, shellfish or other aquatic life forms pose a serious problem for the aquaculture industry. Owing to the high density of animals in the hatchery tanks or enclosed marine farming areas, infectious diseases may eradicate a large proportion of the stock in, for example, a fin-fish, shellfish, or other aquatic life forms facility. Prevention of disease is a more desired remedy to these threats to fish than intervention once the disease is in progress. Vaccination of fish is the only preventative method which may offer long-term protection through immunity. Nucleic acid based vaccinations of fish are described, for example, in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,780,448\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fish immune system has many features similar to the mammalian immune system, such as the presence of B cells, T cells, lymphokines, complement, and immunoglobulins. Fish have lymphocyte subclasses with roles that appear similar in many respects to those of the B and T cells of mammals. Vaccines can be administered orally or by immersion or injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAquaculture species include but are not limited to fin-fish, shellfish, and other aquatic animals. Fin-fish include all vertebrate fish, which may be bony or cartilaginous fish, such as, for example, salmonids, carp, catfish, yellowtail, seabream and seabass. Salmonids are a family of fin-fish which include trout (including rainbow trout), salmon and Arctic char. Examples of shellfish include, but are not limited to, clams, lobster, shrimp, crab and oysters. Other cultured aquatic animals include, but are not limited to, eels, squid and octopi.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides of viral aquaculture pathogens include but are not limited to glycoprotein or nucleoprotein of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV); G or N proteins of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV); VP1, VP2, VP3 or N structural proteins of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV); G protein of spring viremia of carp (SVC); and a membrane-associated protein, tegumin or capsid protein or glycoprotein of channel catfish virus (CCV).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides of bacterial pathogens include but are not limited to an iron-regulated outer membrane protein, (IROMP), an outer membrane protein (OMP), and an A-protein of Aeromonis salmonicida which causes furunculosis, p57 protein of Renibacterium salmoninarum which causes bacterial kidney disease (BKD), major surface associated antigen (msa), a surface expressed cytotoxin (mpr), a surface expressed hemolysin (ish), and a flagellar antigen of Yersiniosis; an extracellular protein (ECP), an iron-regulated outer membrane protein (IROMP), and a structural protein of Pasteurellosis; an OMP and a flagellar protein of \nVibrosis anguillarum\n and \nV. ordalii\n; a flagellar protein, an OMP protein, aroA, and purA of \nEdwardsiellosis ictaluri\n and \nE. tarda\n; and surface antigen of Ichthyophthirius; and a structural and regulatory protein of \nCytophaga columnari\n; and a structural and regulatory protein of Rickettsia..\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides of a parasitic pathogen include but are not limited to the surface antigens of Ichthyophthirius.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect of the invention, there is provided vaccine compositions suitable for use in methods for preventing and/or attenuating diseases or conditions which are caused or exacerbated by \"self' gene products (\ne\n.\ng\n., tumor necrosis factors). Thus, vaccine compositions of the invention include compositions which lead to the production of antibodies that prevent and/or attenuate diseases or conditions caused or exacerbated by \"self' gene products. Examples of such diseases or conditions include graft versus host disease, IgE-mediated allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, Crohn's disease, allergic asthma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Graves' disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory autoimmune diseases, myasthenia gravis, immunoproliferative disease lymphadenopathy (IPL), angioimmunoproliferative lymphadenopathy (AIL), immunoblastive lymphadenopathy (IBL), rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, prion diseases, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease and osteoporosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn related specific embodiments, compositions of the invention are an immunotherapeutic that can be used for the treatment and/or prevention of allergies, cancer or drug addiction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe selection of antigens or antigenic determinants for the preparation of compositions and for use in methods of treatment for allergies would be known to those skilled in the medical arts treating such disorders.

In a further preferred embodiment, the antigen is a combination of at least two, preferably different, epitopes, wherein the at least two epitopes are linked directly or by way of a linking sequence. These epitopes are preferably selected from the group consisting of cytotoxic and Th cell epitopes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should also be understood that a mosaic virus-like particle, \ne.g\n. a virus-like particle composed of subunits attached to different antigens and epitopes, respectively, is within the scope of the present invention. Such a composition of the present invention can be, for example, obtained by transforming \nE.coli\n with two compatible plasmids encoding the subunits composing the virus-like particle fused to different antigens and epitopes, respectively. In this instance, the mosaic virus-like particle is assembled either directly in the cell or after cell lysis. Moreover, such an inventive composition can also be obtained by attaching a mixture of different antigens and epitopes, respectively, to the isolated virus-like particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antigen of the present invention, and in particular the indicated epitope or epitopes, can be synthesized or recombinantly expressed and coupled to the virus-like particle, or fused to the virus-like particle using recombinant DNA techniques. Exemplary procedures describing the attachment of antigens to virus-like particles are disclosed in \n \nWO 00/32227\n \n, in \n \nWO 01/85208\n \n and in \n \nWO 02/056905\n \n, the disclosures of which are herewith incorporated by reference in its entirety\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a method of producing a composition for enhancing an immune response in an animal comprising a VLP and an immunostimulatory substance, preferably an unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotide bound to the VLP which comprises incubating the VLP with the immunostimulatory substance and oligonucleotide, respectively, adding RNase and purifying said composition. In an equally preferred embodiment, the method comprises incubating the VLP with RNase, adding the immunostimulatory substance and oligonucleotide, respectively, and purifying the composition. In one embodiment, the VLP is produced in a bacterial expression system. In another embodiment, the RNase is RNase A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides a method of producing a composition for enhancing an immune response in an animal comprising a VLP bound to an immunostimulatory substance, preferably to an unmethylated CpG-containing oligonucleotide which comprises disassembling the VLP, adding the immunostimulatory substance and oligonucleotide, respectively, and reassembling the VLP. The method can further comprise removing nucleic acids of the disassembled VLP and/or purifying the composition after reassembly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides vaccine compositions which can be used for preventing and/or attenuating diseases or conditions. Vaccine compositions of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, an immunologically effective amount of the inventive immune enhancing composition together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or excipient. The vaccine can also optionally comprise an adjuvant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides vaccination methods for preventing and/or attenuating diseases or conditions in animals. In one embodiment, the invention provides vaccines for the prevention of infectious diseases in a wide range of animal species, particularly mammalian species such as human, monkey, cow, dog, cat, horse, pig, etc. Vaccines can be designed to treat infections of viral etiology such as HIV, influenza, \nHerpes\n, viral hepatitis, Epstein Bar, polio, viral encephalitis, measles, chicken pox, etc.; or infections of bacterial etiology such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, syphilis, etc.; or infections of parasitic etiology such as malaria, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, trichomoniasis, amoebiasis, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention provides vaccines for the prevention of cancer in a wide range of species, particularly mammalian species such as human, monkey, cow, dog, cat, horse, pig, etc. Vaccines can be designed to treat all types of cancer including, but not limited to, lymphomas, carcinomas, sarcomas and melanomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, when compositions of the invention are administered to an animal, they can be in a composition which contains salts, buffers, adjuvants or other substances which are desirable for improving the efficacy of the composition. Examples of materials suitable for use in preparing pharmaceutical compositions are provided in numerous sources including \nREMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES (Osol, A, ed., Mack Publishing Co., (1990\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious adjuvants can be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, and include but are not limited to, Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and \nCorynebacterium parvum\n. Such adjuvants are also well known in the art. Further adjuvants that can be administered with the compositions of the invention include, but are not limited to, Monophosphoryl lipid immunomodulator, AdjuVax 100a, QS-21, QS-18, CRL1005, Aluminum salts, MF-59, and Virosomal adjuvant technology. The adjuvants can also comprise a mixture of these substances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions of the invention are said to be \"pharmacologically acceptable\" if their administration can be tolerated by a recipient individual. Further, the compositions of the invention will be administered in a \"therapeutically effective amount\" (\ni\n.\ne\n., an amount that produces a desired physiological effect).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention can be administered by various methods known in the art. The particular mode selected will depend of course, upon the particular composition selected, the severity of the condition being treated and the dosage required for therapeutic efficacy. The methods of the invention, generally speaking, can be practiced using any mode of administration that is medically acceptable, meaning any mode that produces effective levels of the active compounds without causing clinically unacceptable adverse effects. Such modes of administration include oral, rectal, parenteral, intracistemal, intravaginal, intraperitoneal, topical (as by powders, ointments, drops or transdermal patch), bucal, or as an oral or nasal spray. The term \"parenteral\" as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion. The composition of the invention can also be injected directly in a lymph node.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComponents of compositions for administration include sterile aqueous (\ne\n.\ng\n., physiological saline) or non-aqueous solutions and suspensions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Carriers or occlusive dressings can be used to increase skin permeability and enhance antigen absorption.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombinations can be administered either concomitantly, \ne\n.\ng\n., as an admixture, separately but simultaneously or concurrently; or sequentially. This includes presentations in which the combined agents are administered together as a therapeutic mixture, and also procedures in which the combined agents are administered separately but simultaneously, \ne\n.\ng\n., as through separate intravenous lines into the same individual. Administration \"in combination\" further includes the separate administration of one of the compounds or agents given first, followed by the second.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage levels depend on the mode of administration, the nature of the subject, and the quality of the carrier/adjuvant formulation. Typical amounts are in the range of about 0.1 µg to about 20 mg per subject. Preferred amounts are at least about 1 µg to about 100 µg per subject. Multiple administration to immunize the subject is preferred, and protocols are those standard in the art adapted to the subject in question.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions can conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and can be prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy. Methods include the step of bringing the compositions of the invention into association with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the compositions of the invention into association with a liquid carrier, a finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete units, such as capsules, tablets or lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of the compositions of the invention. Other compositions include suspensions in aqueous liquids or non-aqueous liquids such as a syrup, an elixir or an emulsion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther delivery systems can include time-release, delayed release or sustained release delivery systems. Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the compositions of the invention described above, increasing convenience to the subject and the physician. Many types of release delivery systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther embodiments of the invention include processes for the production of the compositions of the invention and methods of medical treatment for cancer and allergies using said compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther aspects and embodiments of the present invention will become apparent in the following examples and the appended claims.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are illustrative only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the methods of the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll patents and publications referred to herein are expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration of p33 HBcAg VLPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe DNA sequence of HBcAg containing peptide p33 from LCMV is given in \nFigure 1B\n. The p33-HBcAg VLPs (p33-VLPs) were generated as follows: Hepatitis B clone pEco63 containing the complete viral genome of Hepatitis B virus was purchased from ATCC. The gene encoding HBcAg was introduced into the EcoRI/HindIII restriction sites of expression vector pkk223.3 (Pharmacia) under the control of a strong tac promoter. The p33 peptide (KAVYNFATM) derived from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) was fused to the C-terminus of HBcAg (1-185) via a three leucine-linker by standard PCR methods. A clone of \nE. coli\n K802 selected for good expression was transfected with the plasmid, and cells were grown and resuspended in 5 ml lysis buffer (10 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 30 \nmM NaCl\n 10 mM EDTA, 0.25 % Tween-20, pH 7.0). 200 µl of lysozyme solution (20 mg/ml) was added. After sonication, 4 µl Benzonase and 10 mM MgCl\n2\n was added and the suspension was incubation for 30 minutes at RT, centrifuged for 15 minutes at 15,000 rpm at 4°C and the supernatant was retained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNext, 20 % (w/v) (0.2 g/ml lysate) ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant. After incubation for 30 minutes on ice and centrifugation for 15 minutes at 20,000 rpm at 4°C the supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 2-3 ml PBS. 20 ml of the PBS-solution was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-400 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotechnology AG), fractions were loaded onto a SDS-Page gel and fractions with purified p33-VLP capsids were pooled. Pooled fractions were loaded onto a Hydroxyappatite column. Flow through (which contains purified p33-VLP capsids) was collected (\nFigure 2B\n). Electron microscopy was performed according to standard protocols. A representative example is shown in \nFigure 2A\n.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCpG-containing oligonucleotides can be packaged into HBcAg VLPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nRecombinant p33-VLPs were run on a native agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide or Coomassie blue for the detection of RNA/DNA or protein (\nFigure 3\n). Bacterial produced VLPs contain high levels of single stranded RNA, which is presumably binding to the arginine repeats appearing near the C-terminus of the HBcAg protein and being geographically located inside the VLPs as shown by X-ray crystallography. The contaminating RNA can be easily digested and so eliminated by incubating the VLPs with RNase A. The highly active RNase A enzyme has a molecular weight of about 14 kDa and is presumably small enough to enter the VLPs to eliminate the undesired ribonucleic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recombinant p33-VLPs were supplemented with CpG-oligonucleotides (\nFigure 1A\n) before digestion with RNase A. As shown in \nFigure 4\n the presence of CpG-oligonucleotides preserved the capsid structure as shown by similar migration compared to untreated p33-VLPs. The CpG-oligonucleotide-containing VLPs were purified from unbound oligonucleotides via dialysis (4500-fold dilution in PBS for 24 hours using a 300 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane) (\nFigure 5\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCpG-oligonucleotides can be packaged into VLPs by removal of tile RNA with RNAse and subsequent packaging of oligonucleotides into VLPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe p33-VLPs (containing bacterial single-stranded RNA) were first incubated with RNase A to remove the RNA and in a second step the immunostimulating CpG-oligonucleotides (with normal phosphodiester bonds but also with phosphorothioate modification of the phosphate backbone) was supplemented to the samples (\nFigure 6\n). This experiment clearly shows that the CpG-ofigonucleotides are not absolutely required simultaneously during the RNA degradation reaction but can be added at a later time.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVLPs containing CpG-oligonucleotides (with phosphorothioate modification of the phosphate backbone or normal phosphodiester bonds) induces enhanced anti-viral protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMice were subcutaneously primed with 100 µg CpG-oligonucleotide containing p33-VLPs. Before immunization, p33-VLP preparations were extensively purified from unbound CpG-oligonucleotides via dialysis (see Example 2 and \nFigure 5\n). As controls mice were subcutaneously primed with 100 µg p33-VLP alone, mixed with 20 nmol CpG-oligonucleotide, with 20 nmol CpG-oligonucleotide alone or left untreated. Twenty-one days later, mice were challenged with LCMV (200 pfu, intravenously) and viral titers were assessed in the \nspleens\n 5 days later as described in \nBachmann, M. F., \"\nEvaluation of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-specific cytotoxic T cell responses,\n\" in Immunology Methods Manual, Lefkowitz, I., ed., Academic Press Ltd., New York, NY (1997) p. 1921\n. The results are shown in \nFigures 7\n, \n8\n and \n9\n.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration of BKV polyoma capsids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBK virus (BKV) is a non-enveloped double stranded DNA virus belonging to the polyoma virus subfamily of the papovaviridae. VP1 is the major capsid protein. VP1 has 362 amino acids (\nFigure 10\n) and is 42 kDa in size. When produced in E. \ncoli,\n insect cells or yeast VP1 spontaneously forms capsid structures (\nSalunke D.M., et al., Cell 46(6):895-904 (1986\n); \nSasnauskas, K., et al., Biol. Chem. 380(3):381-6 (1999\n); \nSasnauskas, K., et al., 3rd International Workshop \"\nVirus-like particles as vaccines\n\" Berlin, September 26-29 (2001\n); \nTouze, A., et al., J Gen Virol. 82(Pt 12):3005-9 (2001\n). The capsid is organized in 72 VP1 pentamers forming an icosahedral structure. The capsids have a diameter of approximately 45 nm.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFluorescein labeled CpG-containing oligonucleotides can be packaged into BKV VLPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nVLPs produced in yeast contain small amounts of RNA which can be easily digested and so eliminated by incubating the VLPs with RNase A. The highly active RNase A enzyme has a molecular weight of about 14 kDa and is small enough to enter the VLPs to eliminate the undesired ribonucleic acids. Recombinantly produced BKV VLPs were concentrated to 1 mg/ml in PBS buffer pH7.2 and incubated in the absence or presence of RNase A (200µg/ml, Roche Diagnostics Ltd, Switzerland) for 3 h at 37°C. After RNase A digestion BKV VLPs were supplemented with 75 nmol/ml fluorescein labeled phosphorothioate CpG-FAM oligonucleotide and incubated for 3 h at 37°C. Subsequently BKV VLPs were subjected to DNaseI digestion for 3 h at 37°C (40 u/ml AMPD1, Sigma, Division of Fluka AG, Switzerland) or loaded without DNaseI digestion. The samples were complemented with 6-fold concentrated DNA-loading buffer (10 mM Tris pH7.5,10% v/v glycerol, 0.4% orange G) and run for 1 h at 65 volts in a 0.8% native tris-acetate pH 7.5 agarose gel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 12\n shows BKV VLPs in a native 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis after control incubation or after digestion with RNase A and subsequent incubation with fluorescent CpG-FAM oligonucleotides (oligonucleotide from \nFigure 1A\n with a 5'-fluorescein-label) upon staining with ethidium bromide or without ethidium bromide staining. In the presence of ethidium bromide nucleic acids are detected, while in its absence UV excitation leads to fluorescence of the fluorescein-label in the CpG-FAM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe RNase A digestion leads to a change in migration of the VLP, visible on Coomassie stained agarose gel, presumably due to the lack of negative charges from the RNA (\nFigures 13\n and \n14\n). Addition of CpG-oligonucleotide restores the migration of BKV VLPs and results in a fluorescent band with the same migration as the RNA band present in untreated VLPs. This clearly shows that CpG-FAM oligonucleotides have been packaged into VLPs.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge double stranded oligonucleotides can be packaged into BKV VLPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo introduce double stranded (ds) nucleotide sequences, the RNase A treated recombinant BKV VLPs (Example 6) were supplemented with 50µg/ml (ds) DNA fragments (246 bp in length, \nFigure 11\n) and incubated for 3 h at 37°C. The samples were complemented with 6-fold concentrated DNA-loading buffer (10 mM Tris pH8.0, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.4% orange G) and run for 1 h at 65 volts in a 0.8% native tris-acetate pH8.0 agarose gel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 13\n shows BKV VLPs (15 µg) in a native 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis after control incubation or after digestion with RNase A and subsequent incubation with (ds) DNA upon staining with ethidium bromide or Coomassie Blue in order to assess the presence of RNA/DNA or protein. Packaged DNA molecules are visible in the presence of ethidium bromide as a band with the same migration as the VLP band visualized with Coomassie Blue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition of (ds) DNA restores the migration of BKV VLPs and results in a DNA band with the same migration as the Coomassie Blue stained VLPs. This clearly shows that (ds) DNA has been packaged into BKV VLPs.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCpG containing oligonucleotides can be packaged into BKV VLPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo introduce immunostimulatory CpG-oligonucleotides, the RNase A treated recombinant BKV VLPs (Example 6) were supplemented with 150 nmol/ml CpG-oligonucleotides with phosphodiester backbone or with phosphorothioate backbone and incubated for 3 h at 37°C. VLP preparations for mouse immunization were extensively dialysed (10,000-fold diluted) for 24 h against PBS pH7.2 with a 300 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane (Spectrum Medical industries Inc., Houston, USA) to eliminate RNase A and the excess of CpG-oligonucleotides. The samples were complemented with 6-fold concentrated DNA-loading buffer (10 mM Tris pH7.5, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.4% orange G) and run for 1 h at 65 volts in a 0.8% native tris-acetate pH7.5 agarose gel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 14\n shows BKV VLPs (15 µg) in a native 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis after control incubation or after digestion with RNase A and subsequent incubation with .CpG-oligonucleotides (with phosphodiester- or with phosphorothioate backbone) upon staining with ethidium bromide (A) or Coomassie Blue (B) in order to assess the presence of RNA/DNA or protein and the reduction of unbound CpG-oligonucleotides after dialysis. Unbound CpG-oligonucleotides are visible as a low molecular weight ethidium bromide stained band.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition of CpG-oligonucleotides restores the migration of BKV VLPs and results in a DNA band with the same migration as the Coomassie Blue stained VLPs. This clearly shows that CpG-oligonucleotides are packaged into BKV VLPs.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVLPs containing CpG-oligonucleotides (with phosphorothioate modification of the phosphate backbone) induce enhanced Th1 directed immune response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFemale BALB/c mice (three mice per group) were subcutaneously injected with 10 µg BKV VLPs containing phosphorothioate CpG-oligonucleotide (\nFigure 1A\n). As controls mice were subcutaneously injected with either 10 µg of RNase treated BKV VLPs alone or BKV VLPs mixed with 0.3 nmol or 20 nmol phosphorothioate CpG-oligonucleotides in 200 µl PBS pH7.2 or were left untreated. BKV VLPs were prepared as described in Example 8 and before immunization extensively purified from unbound CpG-oligonucleotide by dialysis. On \nday\n 14 after immunization blood was taken and IgG1 and IgG2a antibody response to BKV VLPs was determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 15\n shows IgG1 and IgG2a antibody response to BKV VLPs on \nday\n 14 after immunization. Immunization with RNase A treated BKV VLPs containing phosphorothioate CpG-oligonucleotides results in a decreased IgG1 and an increased anti-BKV VLP IgG2a titer as compared to immunization with the same amount (0.3 nmol) of CpG-oligonucleotides mixed with BKV VLPs or BKV VLPs alone. Mice immunized with BKV VLPs mixed with 20 nmol phosphorothioate CpG-oligonucleotides show very low IgG1 and high IgG2a titers. The decrease in IgG1 titer and the increase in IgG2a titer as compared to controls demonstrates a Th1 cell directed immune response induced by phosphorothioate CpG-oligonucleotides packaged in BKV VLPs. \nFigure 15\n clearly demonstrates the higher potency of BKV VLPs containing CpG-oligonucleotides packaged within the particles as compared to BKV VLPs simply mixed with CpG-oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) can be packaged into VLPs by first RNAse digestion and subsequently addition of dsDNA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe p33-VLPs preparations (containing bacterial RNA) (EXAMPLE 1) were first incubated with RNaseA to remove the RNA and in a second step the linear dsDNA (350 bp long) was supplemented to the samples (\nFigure 16\n). The migration of the p33-VLPs packaged with the dsDNA was similar to the one of p33-VLP containing RNA. This experiment shows that linear dsDNA of at least 350 base pairs in length can be packaged into the virus-like particles.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmunostimulatory nucleic acids can be packaged into HBcAg VLPs comprising fusion proteins with antigens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHBcAg VLPs, when produced in E. \ncoli\n by expressing the Hepatitis B core antigen fusion protein HBc33 (Example 1) or the fusion protein to the peptide P1A (HBcP1A), contain RNA which can be digested and so eliminated by incubating the VLPs with RNase A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gene \nP1A\n codes for a protein that is expressed by the mastocytoma tumor cell line P815. The dominant CTL epitope, termed P1A peptide, binds to MHC class I (Ld) and the complex is recognized by specific CTL clones (\nBrandle et al., 1998, Eur. J. Immunol. 28: 4010-4019\n). Fusion of peptide P1A-1 (LPYLGWLVF) to the C-terminus of HBcAg (aa 185, see Example 1) was performed by PCR using appropriate primers using standard molecular biology techniques. A three leucine linker was cloned between the HBcAg and the peptide sequence. Expression was performed as described in Example 1. The fusion protein of HBcAg with P1A, termed HBcP1A, formed capsids when expressed in E. coli which could be purified similar to the procedure described in Example 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nEnzymatic RNA hydrolysis\n: Recombinantly produced HBcAg-p33 (HBc33) and HBcAg-P1A (HBcP1A) VLPs at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml in 1 x PBS buffer (KC1 0.2g/L, KH2PO4 0.2g/L, NaCl 8 g/L, Na2HPO4 1.15 g/L) pH 7.4, were incubated in the presence of 300 µg/ml RNase A (Qiagen AG, Switzerland) for 3 h at 37°C in a thermomixer at 650 rpm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPackaging of immunostimulatory nucleic acids\n: After RNA digestion with RNAse A HBcAg-p33 VLPs were supplemented with 130 nmol/ml CpG-oligonucleotides B-CpG, NKCpG, G10-PO (Table I). Similarly, the 150mer single-stranded Cy150-1 and 253mer double stranded dsCyCpG-253, both containing multiple copies of CpG motifs, were added at 130 nmol/ml or 1.2 nmol/ml, respectively, and incubated in a thermomixer for 3 h at 37°C. Double stranded CyCpG-253 DNA was produced by cloning a double stranded multimer of CyCpG into the EcoRV site of pBluescript KS-. The resulting plasmid, produced in \nE. coli\n XL1-blue and isolated using the Qiagen Endofree plasmid Giga Kit, was digested with restriction endonucleases XhoI and Xbal and resulting restriction products were separated by agarose electrophoresis. The 253 bp insert was isolated by electro-elution and ethanol precipitation. Sequence was verified by sequencing of both strands.\n\n \nTable I: Sequences of immunostimulatory nucleic acids used in the Examples.

VLPs are completed hydrolysed under these conditions. Proteinase K was inactivated by heating for 20 min at 65°C. 1 µl RNAse A (Qiagen, 100 µg/ml, diluted 250 fold) was added to 25 µl of capsid. 2-30 µg of capsid were mixed with 1 volume of 2x loading buffer (1xTBE, 42% w/v urea, 12% w/v Ficoll, 0.01 % Bromphenolblue), heated for 3 min at 95°C and loaded on a 10% (for oligonucleotides of about 20 nt length) or 15% (for> than 40 mer nucleic acids) TBE/urea polyacrylamid gel (Invitrogen). Alternatively samples were loaded on a 1% agarose gel with 6x loading dye (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM EDTA, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.4 % orange G). TBE/urea gels were stained with CYBRGold and agarose gels with stained with ethidium bromide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigures 17\n, \n18\n and \n19\n show the packaging of B-CpG, NKCpG and G10-PO oligonucleotides into HBc33. RNA content in the VLPs was strongly reduced after RNaseA treatment (\nFigure 17A\n, \n18A\n, \n19A\n) while most of the capsid migrated as a a slow migrating smear presumably due to the removal of the negatively charged RNA (\nFigure 17B\n, \n18B\n, \n19B\n). After incubation with an excess of oligonucleotid the capsids contained a higher amount of nucleic acid than the RNAseA treated capsids and therefore migrated at similar velocity as the untreated capsids. Additional treatment with DNAse I or Benzonase degraded the free oligonucleotides while oligonucleotides packaged in the capsids did not degrade, clearly showing packaging of oligonucleotides. In some cases packaging of oligonucleotides was confirmed by proteinase K digestion (as described in Examples 15 and 16) after DNAseI/Benzonase treatment and dialysis. The finding that oligonucleotides released from the capsid with the procedure described above were of the same size than the oligonucleotide used for packaging clearly demonstrated packaging of oligonucleotides (\nFigure 17C\n, \n18C\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 20\n shows packaging of a large single-stranded oligonucleotide Cy150-1 into HBc33. Cy150-1 contains 7.5 repeats of CyCpG and was synthesized according standard oligonucleotide synthesis methods (IBA, Göttingen, Germany). RNA content in the capsid was strongly reduced after RNaseA treatment while most of the capsid migrated as a slow migrating smear (\nFigure 20A, B\n). Capsid were diluted with 4 volumes of water and concentrated to 1 mg/ml. After incubation with an excess of Cy150-1 the capsid contained a bigger amount of nucleic acid and thus migrated at similar velocity as the untreated capsids. Additional treatment with DNAsel degraded the free, not packaged oligonucleotides while oligonucleotides in capsids were not degraded (\nFigure 20A\n). Release of the DNAseI-resistant nucleic acid from the packaged VLPs by heating for 3 min at 95°C in TBE/urea loading buffer revealed the presence of the 150 mer (\nFigure 20 C)\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 21\n shows packaging of oligonucleotide NKCpGpt in HBcP1A. Treatment with RNAse reduced nucleic acid content and slowed migration of the capsids. Addition of NKCpGpt restored nucleic acid content in capsids and fast migration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 17\n depicts the analysis of B-CpG packaging into HBc33 VLPs on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide (A) and Coomassie Blue (B).

For coupling HBcAg-wt VLPs (2 mg/ml) were derivatized with 25x molar excess of SMPH (Succinimidyl-6-[(β-maleimido-propionamido)hexanoate], Pierce) for 1 h at 25°C in a thermomixer. The derivatized VLPs were dialyzed to Mes buffer (2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulphonic acid) pH 7.4 for 2 x 2 h using MWCO 10.000 kD dialysis membranes at 4°C. VLPs (50µM) were subsequently coupled to the N-terminal cysteine of the p33 peptide (250µM) during a 2 h incubation in a thermomixer at 25°C. Samples were dialyzed (MWCO 300.000) extensively to 1x PBS pH 7.4 to eliminate undesired free peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 22\n shows SDS-PAGE analysis of HBcAg wt VLPs derivatization with SMPH and coupling to p33 peptide. Samples were analysed by 16% SDS PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. HBcAg-wt was visible as a 21 kD protein band. Due to the low molecular weigth of SMPH is the derivatised product only slightly larger and can not be distinguished by SDS-PAGE. Peptide alone was visible as a 3 kD band and coupled product, termed HBx33, showed a strong secondary band at approximately 24 kD accounting for more than 50% of total HBcAg-wt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nEnzymatic RNA hydrolysis\n: HBx33 VLPs (0.5-1.0 mg/ml, 1xPBS buffer pH7.4) in the presence of RNase A (300 µg/ml, Qiagen AG, Switzerland) were diluted with 4 volumes H\n2\nO to decrease salt concentration to a final 0.2xPBS concentration and incubated for 3 h at 37°C in a thermomixer at 650 rpm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPackaging of immunostimulatory nucleic acids\n: After RNase A digestion HBx33 VLPs were concentrated using Millipore Microcon or Centriplus concentrators, then supplemented with 130 nmol/ml CpG-oligonucleotide B-CpGpt and incubated in a thermomixer for 3 h at 37°C in 0.2xPBS pH 7.4. Subsequently, reaction mixtures were subjected to DNaseI digestion (5 U/ml) for 3 h at 37°C (DNaseI, RNase free Fluka AG, Switzerland). VLP preparations for mouse immunization were extensively dialysed (2x against 200-fold volume) for 24 h against PBS pH 7.4 with a 300 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane (Spectrum Medical industries Inc., Houston, USA) to eliminate RNase A and the excess of CpG-oligonucleotides. \nFigure 23\n shows that RNAse treatment reduced the nucleic acid content of the capsids and slowed their migration. Addition of B-CpGpt restored nucleic acid content and fast migration of capsids. DNAse I only digested the free oligonucleotides while the packaged oligonucleotides remained in the VLP also after dialysis (\nFigure 23\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 22\n depicts the SDS-PAGE analysis of the p33 coupling to HBc VLPs after Coomassie Blue staining.

Recombinantly produced Qβ VLPs were derivatized with a 10 molar excess of SMPH (Pierce) for 0.5 h at 25°C, followed by dialysis against 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2 at 4°C to remove unreacted SMPH. Peptides were added in a 5 fold molar excess and allowed to react for 2 h in a thermomixer at 25°C in the presence of 30% acetonitrile. \nFigure 24\n shows the SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrating multiple coupling bands consisting of one, two or three peptides coupled to the Qβ monomer (Arrows, \nFigure 24\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nQβ VLPs, when produced in E. \ncoli\n by expressing the bacteriophage Qβ capsid protein, contain RNA which can be digested and so eliminated by incubating the VLPs with RNase A.\n\n\n \n \nLow ionic strength and low Q\nβ \nconcentration allow RNA hydrolysis of Q\nβ \nVLPs by RNAse A:\n \n\n\n \n \n \nQβ VLPs at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml in 20mM Hepes/150mM NaCl buffer (HBS) pH 7.4 were either digested directly by addition of RNase A (300 µg/ml, Qiagen AG, Switzerland) or were diluted with 4 volumes H\n2\nO to a final 0.2 x HBS concentration and then incubated with RNase A (60 µg/ml, Qiagen AG, Switzerland). Incubation was allowed for 3 h at 37°C in a thermomixer at 650 rpm. \nFigure 25\n demonstrates that in 1xHBS only a very weak reduction of RNA content was observed, while in 0.2x HBS most of the RNA were hydrolysed. In agreement, capsid migration was unchanged after addition of RNAse A in 1x HBS, while migration was slower after addition of RNAse in 0.2xHBS (\nFigure 25 B,D\n).\n\n\n \n \nLow ionic strength increases nucleic acid packaging in Q\nβ \nVLPs:\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAfter RNase A digestion in 0.2 x HBS the Qβ VLPs were concentrated to 1 mg/ml using Millipore Microcon or Centriplus concentrators and aliquots were dialysed against 1x HBS or 0.2 x HBS. Qβ VLPs were supplemented with 130 nmol/ml CpG-oligonucleotide B-CpG and incubated in a thermomixer for 3 h at 37°C. Subsequently Qβ VLPs were subjected to Benzonase digestion (100 U/ml) for 3 h at 37°C. Samples were analysed on 1% agarose gels after staining with ethidium bromide or Coomassie Blue. \nFigure 26\n shows that in 1x HBS only a very low amount of oligonucleotides could be packaged, while in 0.2 x HBS a strong ethidium bromide stained band was detectable, which colocalized with the Coomassie blue stain of the capsids.\n\n\n \n \nDifferent immunostimulatory nucleic acids can be packaged in Q\nβ \nVLPs:\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAfter RNase A digestion in 0.2 x HBS the Qβ VLPs were concentrated to 1 mg/ml using Millipore Microcon or Centriplus concentrators and supplemented with 130 nmol/ml CpG-oligonucleotides B-CpGpt, g10gacga and the 253 mer dsCyCpG-253 (Table I) and incubated in a thermomixer for 3 h at 37°C.

Qbx33 VLP treated with RNase A, packaged with dsCyCpG-253, treated with DNaseI and dialysed.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nQ\n \nβ \n \nDisassembly Reassembly and Packaging of Immunostimulatory Nucleic Acids.\n \n \n\n\n \nDisassembly and Reassembly of Q\nβ \nVLP\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisassembly\n: 70 mg of pure lyophilized Qβ VLP gave a protein content of about 35 mg, according to spectrophotometric determination using the average result obtained with the following three formulae: 1. (183 * OD\n230 nm\n - 75.8 * OD \n260 nm\n) * volume (ml) - 2. ((OD\n235 nm\n - OD\n280 nm\n)/2.51) x volume - 3. ((OD\n228.5 nm\n - OD\n234.5 nm\n) * 0.37) x volume. The pure lyophilized Qβ VLP was solubilized in 7 ml of 6 M GuHCl and incubated overnight at 4°C. The solution was clarified for 15 minutes, at 6000 rpm (Eppendorf 5810 R, in fixed angle rotor F34-6-38, used in all the following steps). A negligible sediment was discarded, and the supernatant was dialysed 5 X against 200-300 ml NET buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 with 5mM EDTA and 150 mM NaCl) over 3 days. Alternatively, the supernatant was dialyzed in a continuous mode against 1.5 1 NET buffer over 3-4 days. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 20 minutes. The pellet was resolubilized in 2-3 ml 8 M urea, while the supernatant was precipitated with solid ammonium sulphate at 60% saturation. A saturated ammonium sulphate solution was added to the pellet previously resolubilized in urea to 60% saturation, and the solution was left to precipitate 4 days at 4°C, with subsequent centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 20 minutes. This pellet, and the pellet of the initial supernatant were resolubilized and joined in a total volume of 3 ml of 7 M urea, 10 mM DTT. This material was loaded on a Sephadex G75 column, eluted at 2 ml/h with 7 M urea, 10 mM DTT. Two peaks were isolated. A high molecular weight peak preceded a peak of lower apparent molecular weight. Calibration of the column with chymotrypsin in the same elution buffer revealed that the apparent molecular weight of the second peak is consistent with Qβ coat protein being in a dimeric form. Fractions containing this dimer material were pooled and precipitated with ammonium sulphate (2 days, at 4°C). The pellet was washed with a few droplets of water, centrifuged again, and solubilized in 2 ml of 7 M urea, 10 mM DTT. This material was then purified on a short (1.5 X 27 cm) Sepharose 4B column. One peak eluted from the column and the fractions were pooled, leading to a protein preparation with a volume of 10 ml, and a ratio of absorbance at 280 nm vs. 260 nm of 0.68/0.5, yielding about 450 nmol of Qβ coat protein (giving a maximum of 2.5 nmol VLP after reassembly, considering that there are 180 subunits in the VLP) and a protein concentration of 630 µg/ml (calculated using the spectrophotometric methods described above).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nReassembly\n: β-mercaptoethanol was added to the 10 ml dimer fraction to a final concentration of 10%, and 300 µl of a solution of (CpG)\n20\nOpA oligodeoxynucleotide, containing 12.3 nmol of oligonucleotide, were added. The reassembly mixture was first dialyzed against 30 ml NET buffer containing 10% beta-mercaptoethanol for 2 hours at 4°C, and then dialyzed in a continuous mode, with a flow of NET buffer of 8 ml/h over 4 days at 4°C. The reassembly mixture was then desalted against water by dialysis, with 6 buffer exchanges (4 X 100 ml, 2 \nX\n 1 liter).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ratio of absorbance at 280 nm vs. 260 nm was of 0.167/0.24. The protein was dried by lyophilization. The dried protein was resolubilized in water and purified by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient in a Beckman L 8-80 centrifuge, with the SW 50.1 rotor at 22 000 rpm, for 17h at +4°C. The sucrose gradient purification was performed as follows. 5 layers of 1 ml of the following sucrose concentrations (w/v) were dispensed into a centrifuge tube: 50%, 43%, 36%, 29% and 22%. The so formed succession of layers was left standing overnight at 4°C. 0.5 ml of the protein sample was layered on the gradient, and centrifuged for 17 h as indicated above. The gradient was eluted from the bottom of the centrifuge tube, and the 5 ml of the gradient were divided in 16 fractions of approximatively 300 µl. The fractions in the gradient were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (\nFigure 28\n) and Ouchterlony assay. Fractions 6-9 contained Qβ coat protein and gave the precipitation band typical of Qβ VLP in an Ouchterlony assay. Fractions 11-15, with a lower apparent density and containing Qβ protein gave no capsid band in the Ouchterlony assay. The reassembled Qβ had the same apparent density as wt Qβ within experimental error. The fractions 6-9 of the sucrose gradient were pooled, dialyzed against water and lyophilized. This material was then resolubilized for electron microscopy (EM) analysis (\nFigure 29\n) and Ouchterlony assay (\nFigure 30A and B\n). The EM procedure was as follows: A suspension of the proteins was absorbed on carbon-formvar coated grids and stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (\npH\n 6,8). The grids were examined with a JEM 100C (JEOL,Japan) electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Photographic records (negatives) were performed on Kodak electron image film and electron micrographs were obtained by printing of negatives on Kodak Polymax paper. Both methods indicate that the reassembled VLPs have the same macromolecular properties as intact Qβ VLP. In addition, the pattern of disulfide bonds displayed by the purified reassembled Qβ VLP is indistinguishable from the disulfide bond pattern displayed by the untreated Qβ VLP, with the typical pattern of pentamers and hexamers (\nFigure 31 A)\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis of nucleic acid content\n: Reassembled Qβ VLP was digested with pancreatic DNAse I as follows. To 200 µl of a 0.5 mg/ml solution of Qβ VLP reassembled with (CpG)\n20\nOpA oligodeoxynucleotide were added 20 µl of a 1 U/µl DNAse I (Fluka) solution, and 22 µl of DNAse I buffer (20 mM MgCl\n2\n, 200 mM Tris, pH 8.3). The reaction mixture was incubated for 2h30 min. at 37°C. The nucleic acid content of the sample was subsequently isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction, and loaded on a 2 % agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide (\nFigure 31B\n). A band of the size of the packaged oligodeoxynucleotide was detected on the gel. A band migrating at a higher apparent molecular weight was also visible. We cannot exclude the presence of multimers of the (CpG)\n20\nOpA oligodeoxynucleotide which would lead to a band at this height. The gel thus shows that DNAse I protected oligodeoxynucleotides of the right size were present in the reassembled Qβ VLP, since the oligodeoxynuleotides could subsequently be digested by DNAse I, but not by RNAse A. Oligodeoxynucleotides could thus be successfully packaged in Qβ VLP after initial disassembly of the VLP, purification of the disassembled coat protein from nucleic acids and subsequent reassembly of the VLP in the presence of oligodeoxynucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 28\n shows the SDS-PAGE analysis of the fractions from the sucrose gradient centrifugation. Loaded on the gels were the following samples. Lane 1 - 10: fractions 6-15 of the sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 29\n shows the EM pictures of (A) intact Qβ VLP and (B) Qβ VLP after disassembly and reassembly in the presence of oligonucleotide (CpG)\n20\nOpA, and subsequent purification by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. A dense overlay of capsids is observed, and those capsids display the same structural features and properties as the intact Qβ VLPs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 30\n shows the Ouchterlony analysis (immunodiffusion) of the reconstructed Qβ VLP. In \nFigure 30 A\n, Qβ VLP reassembled with oligonucleotide (CpG)200pA was loaded next to intact Qβ VLP. The two characteristic precipitation bands are indicated by black arrows. The two precipitation bands are concurrent, indicating that the reassembled Qβ VLP diffuse as the intact Qβ VLP. In \nFigure 30 B\n, \nsample\n 1 is Qβ VLP reassembled in the presence of ribosomal RNA, while \nsample\n 2 is intact Qβ VLP and \nsample\n 3 is Qβ VLP reassembled with oligonucleotide (CpG)200pA. The precipitation bands are indicated by white arrows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 31 A\n shows the analysis of the untreated and reassembled Qβ VLP by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The pentamers and hexamers of Qβ VLP are indicated by arrows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 31 B\n shows the agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of the nucleotide content extracted after DNAse I digestion of Qβ VLP reassembled with oligonucleotide (CpG)200pA. The nucleic acid content was either untreated (lane 1), or subsequently digested with DNAse I (lane2) or RNAse A (lane 3); 33 µg of reassembled Qβ VLP were loaded on each lane. 300 ng of a 50 bp oligonucleotide were loaded on \nlane\n 4, while 10 µl of the GeneRuler 100 bp DNA ladder + marker (MBI Fermentas) was loaded on \nlane\n 5.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nQ\n \nβ \n \nDisassembly Reassembly with different immunostimulatory nucleic acids.\n \n \n\n\n \nDisassembly and Reassembly of Q\nβ \nVLP with oligodeoxynucleotides of various sequences\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe disassembly of Qβ VLP was performed essentially as described in Example 1, but for the use of 8 M urea instead of 7 M urea to resuspend the ammonium sulphate pellets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reassembly of Qβ VLP with the oligos CyOpA, CyCyCy, (CpG)20-OpA and CyCpG was performed essentially as described in Example 1, but for the following variations. A dialysis step against 10 % β-mercaptoethanol in NET buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 with 5mM EDTA and 150 mM NaCl) for 1 hour at 4 °C was added to the procedure before addition of the oligodeoxynucleotide solution to the dimer solution in the dialysis bag. The oligodeoxynucleotides were then added to the dimer solutions, resulting approx. in a ten-fold molar excess of oligonucleotide to capsid (180 subunits) as described previously. The reassembly mixture was first dialyzed against 30 ml NET buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol for 1 hours at 4°C, and then dialyzed in a continuous mode, with a flow of NET buffer of 8 ml/h over 4 days at 4°C. A sample of the reassembly reaction of Qβ VLP with oligodeoxynucleotide CyOpA was taken for EM analysis (\nFigure 32\n) at the end of the reassembly reaction. The EM procedure using phosphotungstic acid and described above was used. The reassembly mixtures were then desalted against water by dialysis and dried.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dried protein was resolubilized in water and purified by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient. The purified reassembled Qβ VLPs were also analyzed by EM (\nFigure 33A-D\n). The electron micrographs indicate that the reassembled VLPs have the same macromolecular properties as intact Qβ VLP. Purification notably enriches the preparations for reassembled particles. Thus, Qβ VLP was successfully reassembled with oligodeoxynucleotides of various lengths and sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCoupling of the p33 peptide to reassembled Q\nβ \nVLP\n: Qβ VLP reassembled with the oligodeoxynucleotide CyOpA was reacted at a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml, with the cross-linker SMPH diluted from a stock solution in DMSO at a final concentration of cross-linker of 536 µM for 35 minutes at 26°C in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4. The derivatized Qβ VLP was dialyzed 2 \nX\n 2 hours against a thousand volumes of 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The dialysed derivatized Qβ VLP at a concentration of 1.4 mg/ml was subsequently reacted with the p33GGC peptide (sequence:\n\n \n \n \nKAVYNFATMGGC) at a final concentration of peptide of 250 µM for 2 hours at 15°C in 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The gel of \nFigure 34\n indicates successful coupling of the p33 peptide to Qβ VLP. Coupling bands corresponding to one, respectively two peptides coupled per subunit are indicated by an arrow in the Figure.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis of nucleic acid content\n: The nucleic acid content of reassembled and coupled Qβ VLP was analysed by proteinase K digestion, phenol cloroform extraction and subsequent loading of the extracted oligonucleotide on a TBE/Urea PAGE gel. The analysis procedure was as follows. 25 µl reassembled Qβ VLP (0.5-1 mg/ml) were supplemented with 0.5 µl proteinase K, 1.5 µl 10% SDS and 3 µl 10x proteinase buffer (0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, 0.1 M Tris pH7.4). After incubation overnight at 37°C, proteinase K was inactivated by heating 20 min at 65°C and the nucleic acid content was extracted from the samples by 1x phenol and 1x chloroform extraction. Subsequently the samples were incubated 2 h at 37°C with 1 µl RNAseA (Qiagen, 100 µg/ml, diluted 250x). The equivalent of 2 µg starting protein was heated 3 min at 95°C with 1 volume of 2x loading buffer (1ml 10xTBE, 4.2 g Urea, 1.2 g Ficoll, 1 ml 0.1%Bromophenolblue, H\n2\nO up to 10 ml) and loaded on a 15% TBE/Urea polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen). The gel was run for 1.5 h at 180 V, and fixed in 10% acetic acid/20% ethanol and stained with CYBR Gold (Molecular Probes, Eugene ,OR, USA). For quantification, 10 and 20 pmol of the oligonucleotide used for the reassembly were applied on the gel as a reference. Resistance of the nucleic acid content to RNAse and its size proved that the packaged nucleic acid was the oligonucleotide used for reassembly. Quantification of the packaged oligodeoxynucleotide was performed by comparison of the band intensity of the extracted oligonucleotide with the band intensity of a reference amount of the same oligonucleotide loaded on the same gel. A figure of 1.75 nmol CyOpA/ 100 µg Qβ VLP was obtained, giving a ratio of 44 oligonucleotides per VLP on average.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 32\n depicts the electron micrographs of the reassembly reaction of Qβ VLP with the oligonucleotide CyOpA before purification. The magnification was 200 000 fold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 33A-D\n show the electron micrographs of the purified reassembly reactions of Qβ VLP with the oligodeoxynucleotides Cy(CpG)20 (A), CyCyCy (B), CyCpG (C) and CyOpA (D).

Precipitation was performed over night at 4°C and precipitated VLPs were sedimented by centrifugation for 60 minutes at 4°C (SS-34 rotor). Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 6 M Guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) containing 100 mM DTT (final concentration) and incubated for 8 h at 4°C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPurification of Q\nβ \ncoat protein by size exclusion chromatography\n: The solution was clarified for 10 minutes at 14000 rpm (Eppendorf 5417 R, in fixed angle rotor F45-30-11, used in all the following steps) and dialysed against a buffer containing 7 M urea, 100 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM DTT (2000 ml) over night. Dialysis buffer was exchanged once and dialysis continued for another 2 h. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. A negligible sediment was discarded, and the supernatant was kept as \"load fraction\" containing dissasembled coat protein and RNA. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford analysis and 5mg total protein was applied onto a HiLoad™ Superdex™ 75 prep grade column (26/60, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 7 M urea, 100 mM TrisHCl and 10 mM DTT. Size exclusion chromatography was performed with the equilibration buffer (7 M urea, 100 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 10 mM DTT) at 12°C with a flow-rate of 0.5 ml/min. During the elution absorbance at 254 nm and 280 nm was monitored. Two peaks were isolated. A high molecular weight peak preceded a peak of lower apparent molecular weight. Peaks were collected in fractions of 1.5 ml and aliquots were analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining as well as SYBR\n®\nGold staining (\nFigure 36\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPurification of Q\nβ \ncoat protein by ion exchange chromatography\n: Alternatively, the clearified supernatant was dialysed against a buffer containing 7 M urea, 20 mM MES, 10 mM DTT, pH 6.0 (2000 ml) over night. Dialysis buffer was exchanged once and dialysis continued for another 2 h. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. A negligible sediment was discarded, and the supernatant was kept as \"load fraction\" containing disassembled coat protein and RNA. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford analysis and 10 mg total protein was diluted to a final volume of 10 ml with buffer A (see below) and applied with a flowrate of 1 ml/min to a 1 ml HiTrap™ SP HP column (Amersham Biosciences, Cat. No. 17-1151-01 ) equilibrated with buffer A: 7 M urea, 20 mM MES, 10 mM DTT, pH 6.0. The flowthrough which contained the RNA was collected as one fraction. After the column was extensively washed with buffer A (30 CV) the bound Qβ coat protein was eluted in a linear gradient from 0% - 100% buffer B (gradient length was 5 CV; buffer A: see above, buffer B: 7 M urea, 20 mM MES, 10 mM DTT, 2 M NaCl, pH 6.0). During the loading, wash and elution the absorbance at 254 nm and 280 nm was monitored. Peak fractions of 1 ml were collected and analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining as well as SYBR\n®\nGold staining. Fractions containing the Qβ coat protein but not the RNA were identified and the pH was adjusted by addition of 100 µl 1 M TrisHCl, pH 8.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples containing the Qβ coat protein but no RNA were pooled and dialysed against 0.87 M urea, 100 mM TrisHCl, 10 mM DTT (2000 ml) over night and buffer was exchanged once and dialysis continued for another 2 h. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. A negligible sediment was discarded, and the supernatant was kept as \"disassembled coat protein\". Protein concentration was determined by Bradford analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nReassembly\n: Purified Qβ coat protein with a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml was used for the reassembly of VLPs in the presence of an oligodeoxynucleotide. For the reassembly reaction the oligodeoxynucleotide was used in a tenfold excess over the calculated theoretical amount of Qβ-VLP capsids (monomer concentration divided by 180). After the Qβ coat protein was mixed with the oligodeoxynucleotide to be packaged during the reassembly reaction, this solution (volume up to 5 ml) was first dialysed for 2 h against 500 ml NET buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol at 4°C, then dialyzed in a continuous mode, with a flow of NET buffer of 8 ml/h over 72 h at 4°C, and finally for another 72 h with the same continous mode with a buffer composed of 20 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. A negligible sediment was discarded, and the supernatant contained the reassembled and packaged VLPs. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford analysis and if needed reassembled and packaged VLPs were concentrated with centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, UFV4BCC25, 5K NMWL) to a final proteinconcentration of 3 mg/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPurification of reassembled and packaged VLPs\n: Up to 10 mg total protein was loaded onto a Sepharose™ CL-4B column (16/70, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl. Size exclusion chromatography was performed with the equilibration buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) at room temperature with a flow-rate of 0.4 ml/min. During the elution absorbance at 254 nm and 280 nm was monitored. Two peaks were isolated. A high molecular weight peak preceded a peak of lower apparent molecular weight. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining (\nFigure 37\n). Calibration of the column with intact and highly purified Qβ capsids from \nE.coli\n revealed that the apparent molecular weight of the major first peak was consistent with Qβ capsids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis of Qβ VLPs which had been reassembled in the presence of oligodeoxynucleotides:\n\n \n \n \n \nA) Overall structure of the capsids:\n Qβ VLPs that were reassembled either in the presence of one of the following oligodeoxynucleotides (CyOpA, Cy(CpG)20OpA, Cy(CpG)20, CyCyCy, (CpG)20OpA), or in the presence of tRNA from \nE.coli\n (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Cat. No. 109541) were analyzed by electron microscopy (negative staining with uranylacetate pH 4.5) and compared to intact Qβ VLPs purified from \nE.coli.\n As a negative control served a reassembly reaction where nucleic acid was omitted. Reassembled capsids display the same structural features and properties as the intact Qβ VLPs (\nFigure 38\n).\n \n \nB) Hydrodynamic size of reassembled capsids:\n Qβ capsids which had been reassembled in the presence of oligodeoxynucleotides were analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and compared to intact Qβ VLPs which had been purified from \nE.coli\n.Reassembled capsids showed the same hydrodynamic size (which depends both on mass and conformation) as the intact Qβ VLPs.\n \n \nC) Disulfide-bond formation in reassembled capsids:\n Reassembled Qβ VLPs were analyzed by native polyacrylamid gelelectrophoresis and compared to intact Qβ VLPs which had been purified from \nE.coli.\n Reassembled capsids displayed the same disulfide-bond pattern as the intact Qβ VLPs (\nFigure 39\n).\n \n \nD) Analysis of nucleic acid content of the Q\nβ \nVLPs which had been reassembled in the presence of oligodeoxynucleotides by agarose gelelectrophoresis\n: 5 µg reassembled Qβ VLPs were incubated in total reaction volume of 25 µl either with 0.35 units RNase A (Qiagen, Cat. No. 19101), 15 units DNAse I (Fluka, Cat. No. 31136), or without any further addition of enzymes for 3 h at 37°C. Intact Qβ VLPs which had been purified from \nE.coli\n served as control and were incubated under the same conditions as described for the capsids which had been reassembled in the presence of oligodeoxynucleotides. The reactions were then loaded on a 0.8% agarose gel that was first stained with ethidumbromide (\nFigure 40A\n) and subsequently with Coomassie blue (\nFigure 40B\n). The ethidium bromide stain shows, that none of the added enzymes could digest the nucleic acid content in the reassembled Qβ capsids showing that the nucleic acid content (i.e. the oligodeoxynucleotides) is protected. This result indicates that the added oligodeoxynucleotides were packaged into the newly formed capsids during the reassembly reaction. In contrast, the nucleic acid content in the intact Qβ VLPs which had been purified from \nE.coli\n was degraded upon addition of RNase A, indicating that the nucleic acid content in this VLPs consists of RNA. In addition, both the ethidium bromide stain and the Coomasie blue stain of the agarose gel shows that the nucleic acid containing Qβ VLPs (reassembled and purified from \nE.coli,\n respectively) are migrating at about the same size, which indicates that the reassembly reaction led to Qβ VLPs of comparable size to intact Qβ VLPs which had been purified from \nE.coli.\n \n\nThe gel thus shows that DNAse I protected oligodeoxynucleotides were present in the reassembled Qβ VLP. Furthermore, after the packaged oligodeoxynuleotides had been extracted by phenol/chloroform they were digestable by DNAse I, but not by RNAse A. Oligodeoxynucleotides could thus be successfully packaged into Qβ VLPs after initial disassembly of the VLP, purification of the disassembled coat protein from nucleic acids and subsequent reassembly of the VLPs in the presence of oligodeoxynucleotides.\n \n \nE) Analysis of nucleic acid content of the Q\nβ \nVLPs which had been reassembled in the presence of oligodeoxynucleotides by denaturing polyacrylamide TBE-Urea gelelectrophoresis:\n 40 µg reassembled Qβ VLPs (0.8 mg/ml) were incubated in a total reaction volume of 60 µl with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (PCR-grade, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Cat. No. 1964364) and a reaction buffer according to the manufacturers instructions for 3 h at 37°C. Intact Qβ VLPs which had been purified from \nE.coli\n served as control and were incubated with proteinase K under the same conditions as described for the capsids which had been reassembled in the presence of oligodeoxynucleotides. The reactions were then mixed with a TBE-Urea sample buffer and loaded on a 15% polyacrylamide TBE-Urea gel (Novex\n®\n, Invitrogen Cat. No. EC6885). As a qualitative as well as quantitative standard, 1 pmol, 5 pmol and 10 pmol of the oligodeoxynucleotide which was used for the reassembling reaction, were loaded onto the same gel. This gel was fixed with 10% acetic acid, 20% methanol, equilibrated to neutral pH and stained with SYBR\n®\n-Gold (Molecular Probes Cat. No. S-11494). The SYBR\n®\n-Gold stain showed (\nFigure 41\n), that the reassembled Qβ capsids contained nucleic acid comigrating with the oligodeoxynucleotides which were used in the reassembly reaction. Note that intact Qβ VLPs (which had been purified from \nE.coli)\n did not contain a nucleic acid of similar size. Taken together, analysis of the nucleic acid content of the Qβ VLPs which had been reassembled in the presence of oligodeoxynucleotides showed that oligodeoxynucleotides were protected from DNase I digestion, meaning that they were packaged) and that the added oligodeoxynucleotides could be reisolated by proper means (e.g. proteinase K digestion of the Qβ VLP).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFigure 36\n shows the purification of disassembled Qβ coat protein by size exclusion chromatography. 5 µl of the indicated fractions (#) were mixed with sample buffer and loaded onto 16% Tris-Glycine gels (Novex\n®\n by Invitrogen, Cat. No. EC64952). After the run was completed the gels were stained first with Coomassie blue (A) and after documentation the same gels were stained with SYBR\n®\n-Gold (B). Note that the first high molecular weight peak (fractions #15 - #20) contained no protein but nucleic acids. On the other hand, the second peak of lower apparent molecular weight contained disassembled coat protein which was thereby separated from the nucleic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 37\n shows the purification of reassembled Qβ VLPs by size exclusion chromatography. 10 µl of the indicated fractions (#) were mixed with sample buffer and loaded onto a 16% Tris-Glycine gel (Novex\n®\n by Invitrogen, Cat. No. EC64952). After the run was completed the gel was stained with Coomassie blue. Due to the reducing conditions, disulfide bonds were reduced and the proteinaceous monomer of the reassembled VLPs is visible as 14 kDa coat protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 38\n shows electron micrographs of Qβ VLPs that were reassembled in the presence of different oligodeoxynucleotides. The VLPs had been reassembled in the presence of the indicated oligodeoxynucleotides or in the presence of tRNA but had not been purified to a homogenous suspension by size exclusion chromatography. As positive control served preparation of \"intact\" Qβ VLPs which had been purified from \nE.coli.\n Importantly, by adding any of the indicated nucleic acids during the reassembly reaction, VLPs of the correct size and conformation could be formed, when compared to the \"positive\" control. This implicates that the reassembly process in general is independent of the nucleotide sequence and the length of the used oligodeoxynucleotides. Note that adding of nucleic acids during the reassembly reaction is required for the formation of Qβ VLPs, since no particles had been formed if nucleic acids were omitted from the reassembly reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 39\n shows the analysis of the disulfide-bond pattern in reassembled and purified Qβ capsids. 5 µg of the indicated capsids were mixed with sample buffer that either contained a reducing agent or not and loaded onto a 16% Tris-Glycine gel. After the run was completed the gel was stained with Coomassie blue. When compared to \"intact\" capsids purified from \nE.coli,\n the reassembled Qβ VLPs displayed the same disulfide bond pattern.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 40\n shows the analysis of nucleic acid content of the reassembled Qβ VLPs by nuclease treatment and agarose gelelectrophoresis: 5 µg of reassembled and purified Qβ VLPs and 5 µg of Qβ VLPs which had been purified from \nE.coli,\n respectively, were treated as indicated. After this treatment, samples were mixed with loading dye and loaded onto a 0.8% agarose gel. After the run the gel was stained first with ethidum bromide (A) and after documentation the same gel was stained with Coomassie blue (B). Note that the nucleic acid content of the reassembled and purified Qβ VLPs were resistant towards RNase A digestion while the nucleic acid content of Qβ VLPs purified from \nE.coli\n was digested upon incubation with RNase A. This indicates that the nucleic acid content of the reassembled Qβ capsids consists out of deoxynucleotides which of course are protected from RNase A digestion. Hence, oligodeoxynucleotides were packaged into Qβ VLPs during the reassembly reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 41\n shows the analysis of nucleic acid content of the reassembled Qβ VLPs by proteinase K treatment and polyacrylamide TBE/Urea gelelectrophoresis: The equivalent of 1 ug Qβ VLPs which had been digested by proteinase K-treatment was mixed with a TBE-Urea sample buffer and loaded on a 15% polyacrylamide TBE-Urea gel (Novex\n®\n, Invitrogen Cat. No. EC6885). As qualitative as well as quantitative standard, 1 pmol, 5 pmol and 10 pmol of the oligodeoxynucleotide which was used for the reassembly reaction, was loaded onto the same gel. After the run was completed, the gel was fixed, equilibrated to neutral pH and stained with SYBR\n®\n-Gold (Molecular Probes Cat. No. S-11494). Note that intact Qβ VLPs (which had been purified from \nE.coli\n) did not contain nucleic acids of similar size than those which had been extracted from reassembled Qβ capsids. In addition, nucleic acids isolated from reassembled VLPs were comigrating with the oligodeoxynucleotides which had been used in the reassembly reaction. This results confirmed that the used oligodeoxynucleotides were packaged into reassembled Qβ capsids.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP205 Disassembly-Purification-Reassembly and Packaging of immunostimulatory nucleic acids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Disassembly and Reassembly of AP205 VLP from material able to reassemble without addition of oligonucleotide\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisassembly:\n 40 mg of lyophilized purified AP205 VLP were resolubilized in 4 ml 6 M GuHCl, and incubated overnight at 4°C. The disassembly mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm (Eppendorf 5810 R, in fixed angle rotor F34-6-38, used in all the following steps). The pellet was resolubilized in 7 M urea, while the supernatant was dialyzed 3 days against NET buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 with 5mM EDTA and 150 mM NaCl) with 3 changes of buffer. Alternatively, dialysis was conducted in continuous mode over 4 days. The dialyzed solution was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 20 minutes, and the pellet was resolubilized in 7 M urea, while the supernatant was pelletted with ammonium sulphate (60% saturation), and resolubilized in a 7 M urea buffer containing 10 mM DTT. The previous pellets all resolubilized in 7 M urea were joined, and precipitated with ammonium sulphate (60% saturation), and resolubilized in a 7 M urea buffer containing 10 mM DTT. The materials resolubilized in the 7 M urea buffer containing 10 mM DTT were joined and loaded on a Sephadex G75 column equilibrated and eluted with the 7 M urea buffer containing 10 mM DTT at 2ml/h. One peak eluted from the column. Fractions of 3 ml were collected. The peak fractions containing AP205 coat protein were pooled and precipitated with ammonium sulphate (60% saturation). The pellet was isolated by centrifugation at 8000 rpm, for 20 minutes. It was resolubilized in 7 M urea, 10 mM DTT, and loaded on a short Sepharose 4B column (1.5 X 27 \ncm Sepharose\n 4B, 2 ml/h, 7 M urea, 10 mM DTT as elution buffer). Mainly one peak, with a small shoulder eluted from the column. The fractions containing the AP205 coat protein were identified by SDS-PAGE, and pooled, excluding the shoulder. This yielded a sample of 10.3 ml. The protein concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically by measuring an aliquot of protein diluted 25-fold for the measurement, using the following formula: (1.55 x OD280 - 0.76 x OD260) x volume. The average concentration was of 1 nmol/ml of VLP (2.6 mg/ml). The ratio of absorbance at 280 nm vs. 260 nm was of 0.12/0.105.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nReassembly:\n 1.1 ml beta-mercaptoethanol was added to the sample, and the following reassembly reactions were set up:\n\n \n \n \n1. 1 ml of AP205 coat protein, no nucleic acids\n \n2. 1 ml of AP205 coat protein, rRNA (approx. 200 OD260 units, 10 nmol)\n \n3. 9 ml of AP205 coat protein, CyCpG (370 ul of 225 pmol/µl solution, i.e. 83 nmol).\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThese mixtures were dialyzed 1 hour against 30 ml of NET buffer containing 10% beta-mercaptoethanol. The mixture containing no nucleic acids was dialyzed separately. The dialysis was then pursued in a continuous mode, and 1 I of NET buffer was exchanged over 3 days. The reaction mixtures were subsequently extensively dialyzed against water (5 changes of buffer), and lyophilized. They were resolubilized in water, and analyzed by EM. All mixtures contained capsids, showing that AP205 VLP reassembly is independent of the presence of detectable nucleic acids, as measured by agarose gel electrophoresis using ethidium bromide staining. The EM analysis of AP205 reassembled with CyCpG is shown on \nFigure 42B\n. The EM procedure was as follows: A suspension of the proteins was absorbed on carbon-formvar coated grids and stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (\npH\n 6,8). The grids were examined with a JEM 100C (JEOL,Japan) electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Photographic records (negatives) were performed on Kodak electron image film and electron micrographs were obtained by printing of negatives on Kodak Polymax paper.The VLP reassembled in the presence of the CyCpG was purified over a Sepharose 4B column (1 X 50 cm), eluted with NET buffer (1 ml/h). The fractions were analyzed by Ouchterlony assay, and the fractions containing VLP were pooled. This resulted in a sample of 8 ml, which was desalted against water by dialysis, and dried. The yield of capsid was of 10 mg. Analysis of resolubilized material in a 0.6% agarose gel stained with ethidium-bromide showed that the capsids were empty of nucleic acids. Samples of the reassembly reaction containing CyCpG taken after the reassembly step and before extensive dialysis were analysed on a 0.6% agarose gel and are shown in \nFigure 43A and B\n. A band migrating at the same height than intact AP205 VLP and staining both for ethidium-bromide and Coomassie blue staining could be obtained, showing that AP205 VLP containing oligodeoxynucleotide had been reassembled. The extensive dialysis steps following the reassembly procedure are likely to have led to diffusion of the oligodeoxynucleotide outside of the VLPs. Significantly, the AP205 VLPs could also be reassembled in the absence of detectable oligodeoxynucleotide, as measured by agarose gel electrophoresis using ethidium bromide staining. Oligodeoxynucleotides could thus be successfully bound to AP205 VLP after initial disassembly of the VLP, purification of the disassembled coat protein from nucleic acids and subsequent reassembly of the VLP in the presence of oligodeoxynucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 42\n shows electron micrographs of either intact recombinant AP205 VLP used for the disassembly step (A), or AP205 VLP disassembled, and subsequently reassembled in the presence of CyCpG (B).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 43\n shows the agarose gel-electrophoresis analysis of the AP205 VLP sample reassembled in the presence of CyCpG, and taken directly after the reassembly step before dialysis. The gel on \nFigure 43A\n was stained with ethidium-bromide. AP205 VLP reassembled with CyCpG was loaded on lane1, while untreated pure AP205 VLP was loaded on \nlane\n 2. The arrow indicates the band of the reassembled AP205 VLP. The gel on \nFigure 43B\n was stained with Coomassie-brillant blue. Untreated AP205 VLP was loaded on \nlane\n 1, while AP205 VLP reassembled with CyCpG was loaded on on \nlane\n 2.\n\n\n \n\n\nB. Reassembly of AP205 VLP using disassembled material which does not reassemble in the absence of added oligonucleotide\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisassembly:\n 100 mg of purified and dried recombinant AP205 VLP (Cytos patent) were used for disassembly as described above. All steps were performed essentially as described under disassembly in part A, but for the use of 8 M urea to solublize the pellets of the ammonium sulphate precipitation steps and the omission of the gel filtration step using a CL-4B column prior to reassembly. The pooled fractions of the Sephadex G-75 column contained 21 mg of protein as determined by spectroscopy using the formula described in part A. The ratio of absorbance at 280 nm to the absorbance at 260 nm of the sample was of 0.16 to 0.125. The sample was diluted 50 times for the measurement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nReassembly:\n The protein preparation resulting from the Sephadex G-75 gel filtration purification step was precipitated with ammonium sulphate at 60% saturation, and the resulting pellet solubilized in 2 ml 7 M urea, 10 mM DTT. The sample was diluted with 8 ml of 10% 2-mercaptoethanol in NET buffer, and dialyzed for 1 hour against 40 ml of 10% 2-mercaptoethanol in NET buffer. Reassembly was initiated by adding 0.4 ml of a CyCpG solution (109 nmol/ml) to the protein sample in the dialysis bag. Dialysis in continous mode was set up, and NET buffer used as eluting buffer. Dialysis was pursued for two days and a sample was taken for EM analysis after completion of this dialysis step (\nFigure 44 B)\n. The dialyzed reassembly solution was subsequently dialyzed against 50% v/v Glycerol in NET buffer, to achieve concentration. One change of buffer was effected after one day of dialysis. The dialysis was pursued over a total of three days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dialyzed and concentrated reassembly solution was purified by gel filtration over a Sepharose 4-B column (1X60 cm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/hour, in NET buffer. Fractions were tested in an Ouchterlony assay, and fractions containing capsids were dried, resuspended in water, and rechromatographed on the 4-B column equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.6.

Reassembly of this disassembled material with an oligonucleotide yielded capsids (\nFigure 44B\n), which were purified and further enriched by gel filtration (\nFigure 44 C)\n. Two sizes of particles were obtained; particles of about 25 nm diameter and smaller particles are visible in the electron micrograph of \nFigure 44C\n. No reassembly was obtained in the absence of oligonucleotides. Loading of the reassembled particles on agarose electrophoresis showed that the reassembled particles contained nucleic acids. Extraction of the nucleic acid content by phenol extraction and subsequent loading on an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide revealed that the particles contained the oligonucleotide used for reassembly (\nFigure 45A\n). Identity of the packaged oligonucleotide was controlled by loading a sample of this oligonucleotide side to side to the nucleic acid material extracted from the particles. The agarose gel where the reassembled AP205 VLP had been loaded and previously stained with ethidium bromide was subsequently stained with Coomassie blue, revealing comigration of the oligonucleotide content with the protein content of the particles (\nFigure 45B\n), showing that the oligonucleotide had been packaged in the particles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLoading of the reassembled AP205 VLP on an SDS-PAGE gel, run in the absence of reducing agent (\nFigure 46\n) demonstrated that the reassembled particles have formed disulfide bridges, as is the case for the untreated AP205 VLP. Moreover, the disulfide bridge pattern is identical to the untreated particles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepicted on \nFigure 44A\n is an electron micrograph of the disassembled AP205 VLP protein, while \nFigure 44B\n shows the reassembled particles before purification. \nFigure 3C\n shows an electron micrograph of the purified reassembled AP205 VLPs. The magnigication of \nFigure 3A-C\n is 200 000 X.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 45 A and B\n show the reassembled AP205 VLPs analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The samples loaded on the gel from both figures were, from left to right: untreated AP205 VLP, 3 samples with differing amount of AP205 VLP reassembled with CyCpG and purified, and untreated Qβ VLP. The gel on \nFigure 45A\n was stained with ethidium bromide, while the same gel was stained with Coomassie blue in \nFigure 45 B\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 46\n depicts an SDS-PAGE analysis of reassembled AP205 VLP, loaded under non-reducing conditions. 5 samples were loaded on the gel. The samples loaded on the gel are, from left to right: Protein Marker, untreated wt Qβ, reassembled wt Qβ, untreated AP205 VLP, reassembled AP205 VLP. The Molecular Weight of the AP205 VLP subunit is 14.0 kDa, while the molecular weight of the Qβ subunit is 14.3 kDa (both molecular weights calculated with the N-terminal methionine). The disulfide linked multimers are each indicated by an arrow on the figure.\n\n\n \n \nC\n. \nCoupling of p33 epitope (sequence: H2N-KAVYNFATMGGC-COOH, with free N- and C- termini ) to AP205 VLPs reassembled with CyCpG\n \n\n\n \n \n \nReassembled AP205 VLP obtained as described in part B, and in 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 was reacted at a concentration of 1.4 mg/ml with a 5-fold excess of the crosslinker SMPH diluted from a 50 mM stock in DMSO for 30 minutes at 15 °C. The obtained so-called derivatized AP205 VLP was dialyzed 2 \nX\n 2 hours against at least a 1000-fold volume of 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer. The derivatized AP205 was reacted at a concentration of 1 mg/ml with either a 2.5-fold, or with a 5-fold excess of peptide, diluted from a 20 mM stock in DMSO, for 2 hours at 15 °C. The sample was subsequently flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe result of the coupling reaction is shown in \nFigure 6\n. A higher degree of coupling could be achieved by using a 5-fold excess of peptide rather than with a 2.5 fold excess of peptide in the coupling reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepicted on \nFigure 47\n is the SDS-PAGE analysis of the coupling reaction. The following samples (from left to right) were loaded on the gel: protein marker; derivatized AP205 VLP (d); AP205 VLP coupled with a 2.5-fold excess of peptide, supernatant (s); AP205 VLP coupled with a 2.5-fold excess of peptide, pellet (p); AP205 VLP coupled with a 5-fold excess of peptide, supernatant (s); AP205 VLP coupled with a 5-fold excess of peptide, pellet (p).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree immunostimulatory nucleic acids but not immunostimulatory nucleic acids packaged in VLPs induce splenomegaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMice were left untreated or immunized s.c. with 100 µg HBc33 alone, 20 nmol CyCpGpt, 100 µg HBc33 mixed with 20 nmol CyCpGpt, or 100 µg HBc33 packaged with CyCpGpt. Twelve days later, spleens were isolated and spleen weigths and splenic cellularity were assessed. CyCpGpt induced a massive increase in spleen weight and number of cells when given alone (\nFigure 48\n). No such effect was seen with CyCpGpt packaged in HBc33 although this composition was able to induce protection against viral challenge (see EXAMPLE 4).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-vivo virus protection assays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccinia protection assay\n\n\n \n \n \nGroups of three female C57B1/6 mice were immunized s.c. with 100 µg VLP coupled or fused to p33 alone, mixed with 20 nmol immunostimulatory nucleic acid or packaged with immunostimulatory nucleic acid. To assess antiviral immunity in peripheral tissues, mice were infected 7-9 days later, i.p., with 1.5x10\n6\n pfu recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the LCMV- glycoprotein (inclusive of the p33 peptide). Five days later the ovaries were collected and viral titers determined. Therefore, ovaries were ground with a homogenizer in Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco) containing 5 % fetal bovine serum and supplemented with glutamine, Earls's salts and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin). The suspension was titrated in tenfold dilution steps onto BSC40 cells. After overnight incubation at 37°C, the adherent cell layer was stained with a solution consisting of 50% ethanol, 2% crystal violet and 150mM NaCl for visualization of viral plaques. Non-immunized naïve mice were used as control.\n\n\n \nLCMV protection assay\n\n\n \n \n \nGroups of three female C57B1/6 mice were immunized s.c. with 100 µg VLP coupled or fused to p33 alone or mixed with adjuvant / 20 nmol CpG oligonucleotide. To examine systemic antiviral immunity mice were infected i.p. 11-13 days later with 200 pfu LCMV-WE. Four days later spleens were isolated and viral titers determined. The spleens were ground with a homogenizer in Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco) containing 2 % fetal bovine serum and supplemented with glutamine, earls's salts and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin). The suspension was titrated in tenfold dilution steps onto MC57 cells. After incubation for one hour the cells were overlayed with DMEM containing 5% Fetal bovine serum, 1 % methyl cellulose, and antibiotics (penicillin /streptomycin /amphotericin). Following incubation for 2 days at 37°C the cells were assessed for LCMV infection by the intracellular staining procedure (which stains the viral nucleoprotein): Cells were fixed with 4 % Formaldehyde for 30 min followed by a 20 min lysing step with 1% Triton X-100. Incubation for 1 hour with 10 % fetal bovine serum blocked unspecific binding. Cells were stained with a rat anti-LCMV-antibody (VL-4) for 1 hour. A peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat-IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc) was used as secondary antibody followed by a colour reaction with ODP substrate according to standard procedures.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent immunostimulatory nucleic acids packaged in VLP fused to antigen result in a potent antigen-specific CTL response and virus protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe fusion protein of HBcAg with the peptide p33 (HBc33) was produced as described in EXAMPLE 1 and packaged with different CpG nucleic acids as described in EXAMPLE 11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n100 µg of vaccines were injected into mice and vaccina titers in the ovaries after recombinant vaccinia challenge were detected as described in EXAMPLE 19. Double stranded CyCpGpt (dsCyCpGpt) was produced by annealing 0.5 mM of DNA oligonucleotides CyCpGpt and CyCpG-rev-pt (Table I) in 15 mM Tris pH7.5 by a 10 min heating step at 80°C and subsequent cooling to RT .

Protection was observed with nucleic acids contained phosphodiester or phosphothioate bonds (pt or PS). Even a double stranded oligonucleotide dsCyCpGpt was inducing protection against vaccinia challenge (\nFigure 49\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nImmunostimulatory nucleic acids packaged in HBcAg and Q\n \nβ \n \nVLPs result in a potent antigen-specific CTL response and virus protection.\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe fusion protein of HBcAg with the peptide p33 (HBc33) was produced as described in EXAMPLE 1 and packaged with oligonucleotide B-CpGpt as described in EXAMPLE 11. Peptide p33 was coupled to the RNA phage Qβ and oligonucleotide B-CpGpt were packaged as described in EXAMPLE 13. 100 µg, 30 µg, 10 µg or 3 µg of each vaccine was injected into mice and vaccina titers in the ovaries after recombinant vaccinia challenge were detected as described in EXAMPLE 19. 100 µg and 30 µg HBc33 and Qbx33 with packaged B-CpG did induce full protection against viral challenge while at lower concentrations partial or no protection was observed (\nFigure 51\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmunostimulatory nucleic acids packaged in VLPs which are coupled to selfantigens can overcome tolerance to self-antigens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTransgenic mice expressing LCMV glycoprotein in pancreatic β islet cells (\nOhasi et al., Cell 65, 305-317 (1991\n)) were immunized with 200 pfu LCMV, 100 µg HBc33 mixed with 20 nmol CyCpGpt, 100 µg HBc33 packaged with CyCpGpt or 100 µg p33 peptide mixed with 20 nmol CyCpGpt as control. Blood glucose levels were measured every four days with the Glucotrend Plus Glucose test kit (Roche). Mice with blood glucose levels larger 12 mM were considered diabetic. Immunization with LCMV induced diabetes in 4/4 animals at \nday\n 12. CyCpGpt mixed with HBc33 only caused diabetes in 1/3 mice. Two of three mice immunized with HBc33 in which CyCpGpt was packaged develop diabetes at \nday\n 12, the third mouse at \nday\n 16. Immunization with peptide p33 mixed with CyCpGpt did not induce diabetes in three mice. This clearly shows that immunostimulatory nucleic acid packaged into VLP to which antigens are fused are much more efficient in enhancing a strong CTL response than a mixture of nucleic acid and antigen. They even induced a stronger response than antigen fused to VLP and mixed with the immunostimulatory nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmunostimulatory nucleic acids packaged in VLPs-coupled to antigens are even more efficient in inducing antigen-specific CD8\n+\n T cells than VLPs mixed with immunostimulatory nucleic acids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nC57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously immunized with 100 µg HBc33 alone, mixed with CyCpGpt or, alternatively, packaged with CyCpCrpt.

As the amount of packaged oligonucleotide is much lower (about 1/20) of the amount of oligonucleotide used in the mixed setting this clearly demonstrates that VLPs with packaged immunostimulatory nucleic acids are even more efficient in inducing high numbers of antigen-specific CD8\n+\n T cells.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmunostimulatory nucleic acids packaged in VLPs are even more efficient in inducing CTL responses than VLPs mixed with immunostimulatory nucleic acids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nGroups of C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously primed with 100 µg p33-VLP given alone, mixed with 20 nmol CyCpGpt, or, alternatively, packaged with CyCpGpt. For detection of primary ex vivo cytotoxicity, effector cell suspensions were prepared from spleens of vaccinated mice 9 days after priming.

Nine days later spleen cells were tested for direct ex vivo CTL activity in a 5-h \n51\n Cr-release assay on p33-pulsed (filled symbols) or on unpulsed (open symbols) EL-4 target cells at the indicated effector to target cell ratios. Radioactivity in cell culture supernatants was measured in a Cobra II Counter (Canberra Packard, Downers Growe, IL). Spontaneous release was always < 10 %. Two dilution series of effector cells per mouse were performed. In (A) two mice per group were used, whereas in (B) and (C) data from four mice per group are shown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 52\n clearly demonstrates that 100 µg HBc33 alone did not induce primary in vivo CTL response while the same amount HBc33 mixed with 20 nmol CyCpGpt did induce a significant cytotoxicity. However, although the amount of packaged oligonucleotide was much lower (about 1/20) of the amount of oligonucleotide used in the mixed setting cytotoxicity was enhanced when 100 µg HBc33 with packaged CyCpGpt were used for immunization (\nFigure 52\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-enzymatic hydrolysis of the RNA content of VLPs and packaging of immunostimulatory nucleic acids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZnSO\n4\n dependent degradation of the nucleic acid content of a VLP:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n5 mg Qβ VLP (as determined by Bradford analysis) in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl was dialysed either against 2000 ml of 50 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n or 2000 ml of 4 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 30 mM NaCl for 2 h at 4°C in SnakeSkin™ pleated dialysis tubing (Pierce, Cat. No. 68035). Each of the dialysis buffers was exchanged once and dialysis was allowed to continue for another 16 h at 4°C. The dialysed solution was clarified for 10 minutes at 14 000 rpm (Eppendorf 5417 R, in fixed angle rotor F45-30-11, used in all the following steps) and proteinconcentration was again determined by Bradford analysis. Qβ VLPs in 50 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n were diluted with the corresponding buffer to a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml whereas Qβ VLPs in 4 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 30 mM NaCl were diluted with the corresponding buffer to a final protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. This capsid-containing solutions were centrifuged again for 10 minutes at 14 000 rpm at 4°C. The supernatants were than incubated with ZnSO\n4\n which was added to a final concentration of 2.5 mM for 24 h at 60°C in an Eppendorf Thermomixer comfort at 550 rpm. After 24 h the solutions were clarified for 10 minutes at 14000 rpm and the sediment was discarded. The efficiency of the ZnSO\n4\n-dependent degradation of nucleic acids was confirmed by agarose gelelectrophoresis (\nFigure 53\n). The supernatants were dialysed against 5000 ml of 4 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 30 mM NaCl for 2h at 4°C. 5000 ml buffer was exchanged once and dialysis continued over night at 4°C. The dialysed solution was clarified for 10 minutes at 14 000 rpm and 4°C, a negligible sediment was discarded and the protein concentration of the supernatants were determined by Bradford analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar results were obtained with copper chloride / phenanthroline / hydrogen peroxide treatment of capsids.

The oligodeoxynucleotides were added at a 300-fold molar excess to the of Qβ-VLP capsids and incubated for 3 h at 37°C in an Eppendorf Thermomixer comfort at 550 rpm. After 3 h the reactions were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 14 000 rpm and 4°C. The supernatants were dialysed in Spectra/Por\n®\nCE DispoDialyzer with a MWCO 300'000 (Spectrum, Cat.

The protein concentration of the dialysed samples were determined by Bradford analysis. Qβ capsids and their nucleic acid contents were analyzed as described in Examples 11 and 13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 53\n shows the analysis of ZnSO\n4\n-treated Qβ VLPs by agarose gelelectrophoresis: Qβ VLPs which had been purified from \nE.coli\n and dialysed either against buffer 1 (50 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n) or buffer 2 (4 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 30 mM NaCl) were incubated either without or in the presence of 2.5 mM zinc sulfate (ZnSO\n4\n) for 24 hrs at 60°C. After this treatment equal amounts of the indicated samples (5 µg protein) were mixed with loading dye and loaded onto a 0.8% agarose gel. After the run the gel was stained with ethidium bromide. Note that treatment of VLPs with ZnSO\n4\n causes degradation of the nucleic acid content, while the mock-treated controls were unaffected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 54\n shows the packaging of oligodeoxynucleotides into ZnSO\n4\n-treated VLPs and analysis of them by agarose gelelectrophoresis. Qβ VLPs which had been treated with 2.5 mM zinc sulfate ( + ZnSO\n4\n) were dialysed against 4 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 30 mM NaCl and incubated for 3 hrs at 37°C with an excess of oligodeoxynucleotides (due to the dialysis the concentration of ZnSO\n4\n was decreased by an order of 10\n6\n, therefore its indicated only in parenthesis) After this incubation in presence of oligodeoxynucleotides, equal amounts of the indicated samples (5 µg protein) were mixed with loading dye and loaded onto a 0.8% agarose gel. After the run the gel was stained with ethidium bromide. Note that adding of oligodeoxynucleotides to ZnSO\n4\n-treated Qβ VLPs could restore the electrophoretical behaviour of the so treated capsids when compared to untreated Qβ capsids which had been purified from \nE.coli.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 55\n shows the analysis of nucleic acid content of ZnSO\n4\n- and oligodeoxynucleotide treated Qβ VLPs by Benzonase and proteinase K digestion and polyacrylamide TBE/Urea gelelectrophoresis: Oligodeoxynucleotides were packaged into ZnSO\n4\n-treated Qβ VLPs as described above. 25 µg of these VLPs were digested with 25 µl Benzonase (Merck, Cat. No. 1.01694.0001) according to the manufactures instructions. After heat-inactivation of the nuclease (30 minutes at 80°C) the VLPs were treated with Proteinase K (final enzyme concentration was 0.5 mg/ml) according to the manufactures instructions. After 3 hrs the equivalent of 2 ug Qβ VLPs which had been digested by Benzonase and proteinase K were mixed with TBE-Urea sample buffer and loaded on a 15% polyacrylamide TBE-Urea gel (Novex\n®\n, Invitrogen Cat. No. EC6885). The capsids loaded in \nlane\n 2 were treated with 2.5 mM ZnSO\n4\n in presence of buffer 1 (see above), while the capsids loaded in \nlane\n 3 were treated with 2.5 mM ZnSO\n4\n in presence of buffer 2 (see above). As qualitative as well as quantitative standard, 1 pmol, 5 pmol and 10 pmol of the oligodeoxynucleotide which was used for the reassembly reaction, was loaded onto the same gel (lanes 4 - 6). As control, Qβ capsids which had been purified from \nE.coli\n were treated exactly the same and analyzed on the same polyacrylamide TBE-Urea gel (lane 1). After the run was completed, the gel was fixed, equilibrated to neutral pH and stained with SYBR-Gold (Molecular Probes Cat. No. S-11494). Note that intact Qβ VLPs (which had been purified from \nE.coli\n) did not contain nucleic acids of similar size than those which had been extracted from ZnSO\n4\n- and oligodeoxynucleotide treated Qβ capsids. In addition, nucleic acids isolated from the latter VLPs were comigrating with the oligodeoxynucleotides which had been used in the reassembly reaction. This results confirmed that the used oligodeoxynucleotides were packaged into ZnSO\n4\n-treated Qβ capsids.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVLPs containing containing immunostimulatory nucleic acids induce T cell responses that can be boosted by viral vectors: LCMV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMice were subcutaneously primed with 20 µg p33-VLPs containing immunostimulatory nucleic acids.

The mice were boosted with 200 pfu of live LCMV strain WE and frequencies of specific T cells were determined 5 days later. Frequencies before boost were 3.5% +/- 1.8% and after boost 15.5% +/- 1.9%.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVLPs containing immunostimulatory nucleic acids induce T cell responses that can be boosted by viral vectors: recombinant vaccinia virus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMice are subcutaneously primed with 20 µg p33-VLPs containing immunostimulatory nucleic acids.

Reassembly is performed by adding β-mercaptoethanol to the 10 ml dimer fraction to a final concentration of 10%, and 300 µl of a solution of nucleic acid, resulting in a 1, 10 and 100 molar excess over capsid concentration, are added. The reassembly mixtures are first dialyzed against 30 ml NET buffer containing 10% beta-mercaptoethanol for 2 hours at 4°C, and then dialyzed in a continuous mode, with a flow of NET buffer of 8 ml/h over 4 days at 4°C. The reassembly mixtures are then desalted against water by dialysis, with 6 buffer exchanges (4 X 100 ml, 2 \nX\n 1 liter). Reassembled Qβ VLPs are then isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described in Example 14 or by gelfiltration as described in Example 16.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following pages 155 to 186 contain preferred embodiments.

Rev. 46, 157-204, 1994). Both pharmacological characterization and molecular cloning of several 5-HT receptor genes has revealed that 5-HT mediates its diverse physiological actions through a multiplicity of receptor subtypes. These receptors belong to at least two different protein superfamilies: ligand-gated ion channel receptor (5- HT\n3\n) and the G-protein-coupled 7-transmembrane receptors (thirteen distinct receptors cloned to date). In addition, within the G-protein-coupled receptors, serotonin exerts its actions through an array of signal transduction mechanisms. \n\n - A -\n\n\nThe 5-HT\n5\nA receptor is one of 13 G-protein coupled 5-HT receptors and is Gi-α- coupled, inhibiting adenylate cyclase. The receptor protein DNA sequence is not closely related to that of any previously known serotonin receptor, with the best homology being 35% to the human 5-HTi\nB\n receptor. It encodes a predicted 357 amino-acid protein, with seven putative transmembrane domains, consistent with that of a G-protein coupled receptor. The sequence is characterized by containing an intron between transmembrane domains V and VI (5-HT\n5A)\n; Barnes, N.M., & Sharp, T. (1999). A review of central 5-HT receptors and their function. Neuropharmacology 38, 1083-1152; Thomas D. R. 5-HT\n5\nA receptors as a therapeutic target. Pharmacol Ther. (2006), l l l(3):707-14; Francken BJ., Jurzak M., Vanhauwe J. F., Luyten W.H., Leysen J.E. The human 5-HT5A receptor couples to Gi/Go proteins and inhibits adenylate cyclase in HEK 293 cells. Eur. J. Pharmacol. (1998), 361(2-3):299-309. A recent review by Thomas (Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 111, 707-714; 2006) describes the potential therapeutic utility of 5-HT\n5\nA receptor ligands for the treatment of circadian rhythm, sleep disturbances, mood disorders, schizophrenia, cognitive disorders and autism.\n\n\nThe human 5-HT\n5\nA mRNA is distributed in CNS areas, such as the thalamus, limbic cortex, ventrolateral amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus (Pasqualetti, M., Ori, M., Nardi, L, Castagna, M., Cassano, G. B., & Marazziti, D. (1998). Distribution of the 5-HT5A serotonin receptor mRNA in the human brain. MoI Brain Res 56, 1~8). All of these CNS areas are implicated in either the pathology or treatment of schizophrenia and anxiety. The receptor has not been detected in peripheral organs (Rees, S., Dendaas, L, Foord, S., Goodson, S., Bull, D., Kilpatrick, G., et al. (1994). Cloning and characterisation of the human 5-HT5A serotonin receptor. FEBS Lett 355, 242-246), although it is expressed in rat superior cervical ganglia (Wang, Z. Y., Keith, I. M., Beckman, M. J., Brownfield, M. S., Vidruk, E. H. and Bisgard, G. E. (2000) 5-HT5A receptors in the carotid body chemoreception pathway of rat. Neurosci. Lett. 278, 9—12) and the spinal cord dorsal horn which may indicate the involvement of the 5-HT\n5\nA receptor in central motor control, nociception and autonomic function such as stress induced urinary incontinence and overactive bladder (DoIy, S., Fischer, J., Brisorgueil, M. -J., Verge, D. and Conrath M. 5- HT5A Receptor Localization in the Rat Spinal Cord Suggests a Role in Nociception and Control of Pelvic Floor Musculature The Journal of comparative neurology 476:316-329 (2004)). Gene association studies investigating the occurrence of several common polymorphisms within the 5-HT\n5\nA receptor gene, such as -19G/C which shows allelic association with bipolar affective disorder, unipolar depression and schizophrenia (Birkett, \n\n J.T., Arranz, MJ., Munro, J., Osbourn, S., Kerwin, R. W., Collier, D.A., 2000. Association analysis of the 5-HT5A gene in depression, psychosis and antipsychotic response. Neuroreport 11, 2017-2020). In addition, an allelic association of the polymorphism Pro- 15-Ser was found within a large proportion of Japanese schizophrenic patients (Iwata, N., Ozaki, N., Inada, T., & Goldman, D. (2001). Association of a 5-HT5A receptor polymorphism, Prol5Ser, to schizophrenia. MoI Psychiatry 6, 217-219).\n\n\nUntil recently, pharmacological characterisation of the 5-HT\n5\nA receptor has been limited due to lack of available selective ligands. However, in 2006 Garcia- Ladona, FJ. et al. 36th Annu. Meet. Soc. Neurosci. (2006), Oct 14-18, Atlanta, Abstract 33.1 (see also WO 2005082871) reported preclinical evidence that certain selective 5-HT\n5\nA receptor antagonists have an antipsychotic profile in animal models of schizophrenia by antagonizing methamphetamine and MK-801 -induced hyperlocomotion, apomorphine- induced climbing and mescaline-induced scratching, while reversing disrupted social interaction (Jongen-Relo et al., 2006). Supporting evidence included, a reduction in the number of spontaneously active midbrain dopaminergic neurons observed after subchronic A- 763079 treatment, suggesting potential antipsychotic-like activity. Data indicating that their 5-HT\n5\nA receptor antagonists increase ACh levels in mPFC (Drescher, K.U. et al. 36th Annu. Meet. Soc. Neurosci. (2006), Oct 14-18, Atlanta, Abstr. 33.2), and suggesting the potential efficacy of 5-HT\n5\nA receptor antagonists against the cognitive deficits associated with different psychiatric disorders, in particular schizophrenia and psychosis were also presented. Thomas et al. (2006), (SB-699551-A (3-cyclopentyl-N-[2- (dimethylamino)ethyl]-N-[(40-{ [(2 phenylethyl)amino]methyl}-4 biphenylyl) methyl] propanamide dihydrochloride), a novel 5-ht5A receptor-selective antagonist, enhances 5-HT neuronal function: Evidence for an autoreceptor role for the 5-ht5A receptor in guinea pig brain. Neuropharmacology. 2006 Sep;51(3):566-77) recently published microdialysis data demonstrating 5-HT\n5\nA receptor antagonism of 5-CT-induced guinea-pig raphe neuronal firing and implying that the receptor may also act as an autoreceptor, with similar effects of those produced by anxiolytics and antidepressants. No behavioural data has been provided mainly due to species limitations. Furthermore, 5- HT\n5\nA receptor is expressed in the hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus a region known to be involved in circadian timing circuitry (Duncan, MJ., Jennes, L., Jefferson, J. B., Brownfield, M.S. (2000). Localization of serotonin5A receptors in discrete regions of the circadian timing system in the Syrian hamster. Brain Research 869, 178-185). Activation of both 5- HT\n5\nA and 5-HT\n7\n receptors can produce phase advances of the circadian clock in-vitro\n\n\n(Sprouse J, Reynolds L, Braselton J, Schmidt A.

pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and their optical isomers can be prepared by methods known in the art. These methods are described below in routes 1 to 17. As an example, a process may be used to prepare some of the preferred compounds, which comprises one of the following steps:\n\n\nA process to prepare the compound of formula I,\n\n\n \n\n wherein\n\n\nR\n1\n is -NH-Ar\n1\n, -NHCH\n2\n-Ar\n1\n, -NHCH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n-Ar\n1\n, or -NHCH\n2\nCH\n2\nO-Ar\n1\n, R\n2\n is -Ar\n2\n, -CH\n2\n-Ar\n2\n, or -CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO-Ar\n2\n, R\n3\n is hydrogen, phenyl or pyridinyl, optionally substituted with one or more Ci-4-alkyl, halo, or Ci-4-alkoxy, and\n\n\nAr\n1\n and Ar\n2\n are as defined above,\n\n\ncomprising the steps of\n\n\n(a) reacting a compound of formula 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein Hal is Cl or Br, with an amine R\n2\n-NH\n2\n to give a compound of formula 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) followed by palladium catalyzed substitution reaction with the amines Ar\n1\nNH\n2\n, Ar\n1\n- CH\n2\n-NH\n2\n, Ar^CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n-NH\n2\n, or Ar^OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n-NH\n2\n; \n\n and, if desired, converting the compounds obtained into pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.\n\n\nBiological Tests:\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the compounds of formula I or formula I' and their pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts possess valuable pharmaceutical properties. It has been found that the compounds of the present invention are active on the 5-HT\n5\nA receptor and therefore suitable for the treatment of depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, panic disorders, agoraphobia, social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, pain, memory disorders, dementia, disorders of eating behaviors, sexual dysfunction, sleep disorders, withdrawal from abuse of drugs, motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease, psychiatric disorders or gastrointestinal disorders.\n\n\nTest description\n\n\nA [\n3\nH]LSD radioligand binding assay was used to determine the affinity of the compounds for the recombinant human 5-HT\n5\nA receptor, in membranes from transiently (cDNA) expressed 5-HT\n5\nA receptors in Human Embryonic Kidney-EBNA (HEK-EBNA) cells. Assay buffer consisted of Tris (50 mM) buffer containing 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.4) and 10 μM pargyline. The binding assay was carried out in 96-well-plates in the presence of [\n3\nH]LSD (approximately 1 nM), approximately 2 μg/well of membrane protein, and 0.5 mg of Ysi-poly-1-lysine SPA beads in a final volume of 200 μl of buffer. Non-specific binding was defined using methiothepin 2μM. Compounds were tested at 10 concentrations. All assays were conducted in duplicate and repeated at least two times.\n\n\nAssay plates were incubated for 120 min at room temperature before centrifugation. Bound ligand was determined using a Packard Topcount scintillation counter. IC\n5\nO values were calculated using a non-linear curve fitting program and Ki values calculated using the Cheng-Prussoff equation.\n\n\nThe affinity towards the human 5-HT\n5\nA receptor of the compounds according to the invention is exemplified in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose,corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acids or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like. Depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are however usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oil and the like. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical preparations can, moreover, contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.\n\n\nMedicaments containing a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically inert carrier are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for their production, which comprises bringing one or more compounds of \n\n formula I and/or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical administration form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.\n\n\nThe most preferred indications in accordance with the present invention are those, which include disorders of the central nervous system, for example the treatment of anxiety, depression, sleep disorders and schizophrenia.\n\n\nThe dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, have to be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In the case of oral administration the dosage for adults can vary from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg per day of a compound of general formula I or of the corresponding amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The daily dosage may be administered as single dose or in divided doses and, in addition, the upper limit can also be exceeded when this is found to be indicated.\n\n\nTablet Formulation (Wet Granulation)\n\n\nItem Ingredients mg/ tablet\n\n\n5 mg 25 mg 100 mg 500\n\n\n1.

The invention is also directed to proteins produced by these methods. The invention is also directed to methods for production of protein molecular weight marker ladders, and to ladders produced by these methods.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRelated Art\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWith the advent of recombinant DNA technology, it has become almost routine to produce large amounts of proteins in heterologous expression systems, such as transformed host cells, for commercial and basic research purposes. Among the expression host systems, \nE. coli\n is the most popular system because of ease with which \nE. coli\n can be manipulated. However, expression of heterologous proteins in host cells has some limitations. These include: inefficient translation of mRNA due to the presence of infrequently used codons (\nKane, J., Current Opin. Biotech 6:494-500 (1995\n)), instability of mRNA in \nE\n. \ncoli\n (\nBachmair, A. et al., Science 234:179-186 (1986\n); \nOlins. P. & Lee, S., Current Opin. Biatech 6:501-506 (1993\n)), toxic effect of the protein being expressed (\nBrosius, J., Gene 27:161-172 (1984\n); \nStudier, W. & Mofatt, B., J. Mol Biol. 189:113-130 (1986\n)), and formation of inclusion bodies because of inappropriate folding of the protein (\nSchein, C., BiolTechnology 7:1141-1149 (1989\n); \nMitraki, A. & King, J., BiolTechnology 7:690-697 (1989\n)). To solve these problems, a variety of techniques have been developed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene fusion is one of the most popular strategies to express proteins of interest. This particular technique is used to produce large amounts of heterologous protein by fusing the protein of interest to the carboxy terminal end of a fusion partner (\nLaVallie, E, and McCoy, J., Curr. Opin. Biotech 6:501-506\n). As an example of this approach, methods have been developed for selective isolation of a desired protein or polypeptide by constructing a recombinant vector containing a DNA sequence coding for the desired protein or polypeptide which is operatively linked to a DNA sequence coding for protein A (\n \nWO 84/03103\n \n) The expressed fusion protein is then selectively isolated by adsorption onto an IgG-supporting carrier, which binds protein A, followed by desorption of the fusion protein. The fusion protein is then cleaved at a unique cleavage site with a cleavage agent, which may include proteases, hydroxylamine, cyanogen bromide or formic acid, to give the purified protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost systems used for the manufacture of recombinant polypeptides attempt to minimize the production of the polypeptide in inclusion bodies in the expressing host cells. One important reason for these attempts is that the production of polypeptides in inclusion bodies often yields a biochemicaity inactive, denatured, or otherwise functionally or structurally compromised polypeptide upon its release from the inclusion bodies via standard solubilization techniques. While a variety of methods have shown some promise in minimizing inclusion body formation, gene fusion techniques in particular have been utilized to produce soluble proteins which otherwise would have been produced as inclusion bodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, the formation of inclusion bodies within host cells can also be advantageous. For example, inclusion bodies constitute highly dense and concentrated \"packets\" of the desired polypeptide, from which contaminating host cell proteins can be removed by methods as simple as centrifugation. After their isolation, controlled conversion of the inclusion bodies to a soluble form could provide a rich source of the desired polypeptide in its pure, biologically active or structurally intact form The difficulty with such an approach, however, has been that it is usually nearly impossible to predict whether or not a recombinant polypeptide will form inclusion bodies when it is expressed in a host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the current invention provides a system in which controlled formation of inclusion bodies is used to produce a desired polypeptide. By this controlled formation of inclusion bodies, purification of the desired polypeptide is rendered faster and more complete, and subsequent controlled solubilization of the inclusion bodies provides a high yield of pure polypeptide in its active form.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe current invention provides a system wherein the genetic sequence encoding a first polypeptide is operatively linked or fused to that encoding an inclusion partner protein, such as thioredoxin or a modified thioredoxin, which is capable of forming inclusion bodies in a host cell upon expression. Specifically, the invention provides a method for producing a polypeptide in the form of inclusion bodies comprising (a) obtaining a host cell comprising a first nucleic acid molecule encoding a recombinant polypeptide operatively linked to a second nucleic acid molecule encoding an inclusion partner protein, thereby forming a gene fusion construct; and (b) cultivating the above host cell under conditions favoring production of the polypeptide as inclusion bodies in the host cell, The invention also provides the above method further comprising (c) isolating the inclusion bodies from the host cell; and (d) releasing the polypeptide from the inclusion bodies. According to the present invention, the first nucleic acid molecule encoding the polypeptide may be obtained from a prokaryotic cell, particularly a bacterial cell and most particularly an \nEscherichia coli\n cell, or from a eukaryotic cell, particularly an animal cell, a plant cell or a yeast cell, more particularly a mammalian animal cell, and most particularly a human cell, and the second nucleic acid molecule encoding the inclusion partner protein may be obtained from a bacterial cell, most preferably an \nEscherichia coli\n cell. The inclusion partner protein may be any protein that forms an inclusion body upon expression in a host cell, and is preferably a bacterial protein, more preferably a bacterial thioredoxin or modified bacterial thioredoxin, and most preferably a carboxy terminal-truncated form of \nE. coli\n thioredoxin\" Preferably, the gene fusion construct is inserted into a vector prior to being introduced into the host cell. According to one aspect of the invention, the polypeptide of interest may be released from inclusion bodies, formed by the gene fusion construct, by cleavage with a chemical such as cyanogen bromide, or more preferably with an enzyme such as thrombin or enterokinase. According to another aspect, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein-specific cleavage site may be placed between the nucleic acid sequence encoding the inclusion partner protein and the recombinant polypeptide in the gene fusion construct; upon expression of the fusion protein as inclusion bodies in the host cells, the recombinant polypeptide may then be released therefrom by treating the inclusion bodies with an enzyme or other chemical that specifically recognizes and cleaves at the protein-specific cleavage site. The invention also provides the above-described methods wherein the gene fusion construct comprises plasmid pTrcprl-monomer, and provides plasmid pTrcprl-monomer. The invention is also directed to the above-described methods wherein the host cell is a bacterial cell, most preferably an \nEscherichia coli\n cell, and wherein the vector used is an expression vector, most preferably plasmids pTrc99A or pTrxfus. The invention also provides these vectors, and host cells, particularly bacterial cells and most particularly \nEscherichia coli\n cells, comprising these vectors. Although the present invention is most particularly directed to methods for the production of fragments of the gene 32 protein of bacteriophage T4, of \nkpn\nI methylase and Dead-Box protein, any recombinant polypeptide may be produced by the present methods. The invention also provides recombinant polypeptides produced by the above-described methods. Thus, the present system provides reliable methods for producing any heterologous protein as inclusion bodies in a host cell, thereby facilitating the rapid isolation and purification of recombinant proteins produced in bacterial host cells. In addition, the methods provided by the present invention may be used to produce polypeptides that are small or difficult to express, as well as those that are toxic to host cells such as \nE. coli.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides methods for producing a protein molecular weight marker ladder, comprising (a) obtaining one or more nucleic acid molecules wherein each of the nucleic acid molecules encodes one or more polypeptides of different molecular weights of the molecular weight ladder; (b) transforming one or more host cells with one or more of the nucleic acid molecules; (c) culturing the host cells under conditions favoring the production of each of the polypeptides of the molecular weight ladder; and (d) isolating each of the polypeptide. The invention is particularly directed to such methods wherein at least one of the nucleic acid molecules encodes a plurality of the polypeptides of different molecular weights of the molecular weight ladder, and wherein the nucleic acid molecules each encode a different polypeptide of the molecular weight ladder. The invention is also directed to such methods wherein the host cell comprises a nucleic acid molecule encoding a plurality of polypeptides of the molecular weight ladder, and wherein each of the host cells comprises a different nucleic acid molecule each encoding a different polypeptide of the molecular weight ladder. The invention also provides such methods wherein a host cell comprises two or more of the nucleic acid molecules each encoding a different polypeptide of the molecular weight ladder, and wherein such method further comprises admixing each of the different polypeptides to form a molecular weight ladder. The present invention is particularly directed to such methods wherein the polypeptides of the molecular weight ladder are produced as inclusion bodies, and wherein the nucleic acid molecule encoding the polypeptide(s) is inserted into a vector, most preferably an expression vector, prior to transforming the host cells Protein molecular weight ladders produced by the methods of the present invention are preferably prestained, and the invention provides optimal conditions for prestaining of the proteins to produce these molecular weight ladders. The present invention also provides protein molecular weight marker ladders, which are preferably prestained, produced by these methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also generally relates to methods for producing a stained protein and more particularly prestained protein ladders. Such methods of the invention comprise contacting the one or more proteins or polypeptides of interest with one or more dyes under conditions sufficient to completely or substantially completely label or complex the dye(s) to the protein molecule(s). Preferably, he staining method of the invention is performed on the proteins or protein sample prior to size separation by, for example, gel electrophoresis. Thus, use of the protein or polypeptide staining method of the invention provides a homogeneous or near homogeneous sample in which all or substantially all of the proteins or polypeptides in the sample have been stained or complexed with the dye of interest Such uniform staining provides increased color intensity upon examination of stained proteins due at least in part to more dye being complexed with the proteins or polypeptides (\ne\n.\ng\n., increased staining of the proteins of interest). Additionally, because of the uniformity and/or completeness of staining, the character of the stained protein will appear more consistent in subsequent analysis. Thus, when performing size analysis on the stained proteins or polypeptides of the invention, the proteins or polypeptides will be the same or substantially the same size. Such a feature of the stained proteins or polypeptides of the invention provides for superior protein molecular weight markers which allow more accurate size determination of an unknown protein or polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention thus relates to a method of staining one or more polypeptides or proteins comprising:\n\n \n \n \n(a) mixing or contacting a sample comprising the one or more polypeptides or proteins with one or more dyes; and\n \n(b) incubating the mixture under conditions sufficient to produce stained proteins or polypeptides having the same or substantially the same size. Such method may further comprise separating the stained proteins by size. Size separation may be accomplished by any known technique, including gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, gel filtration chromatography and the like.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to a method for staining one or more polypeptides or proteins comprising:\n\n \n \n \n(a) mixing or contacting a sample comprising the one or more polypeptides or proteins with one or more dyes; and\n \n(b) incubating the mixture under conditions sufficient to produce stained proteins or polypeptides wherein substantially all of the proteins or polypeptides are complexed with the dye. Such methods may further comprise separating the stained proteins by size using standard techniques such as those described above.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAny conditions may be utilized to produce the desired result in accordance with the invention. In particular, protein concentrations, dye concentrations, pH, ionic conditions, temperature, and duration of exposure, or combinations of these parameters, may be varied to produce stained proteins or prestained molecular weight markers of the invention. In accordance with the invention, pH of the solution to which the protein(s) and dye(s) are added may be varied from about 7-12, incubation temperature may be varied between about 20°C-80°C (more preferably about 37°C-70°C, and still more preferably about 50°C-70°C), and the duration of incubation may vary from about 1-200 hours (preferably about 2-200 hours, about 2-100 hours, about 6-100 hours, about 6-72 hours, about 6-48 hours, more preferably about 12-48 hours, and still more preferably about 12-24 hours).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny one or-a number of proteins or peptides may be stained in accordance with the invention Such staining methods may be accomplished on different proteins (different size and/or type) at the same time or separately. If desired, separately stained proteins may be mixed after staining to provide a mixture of stained proteins having different sizes to produce, for example, a protein molecular weight ladder of the invention. Preferably, the molecular weight ladder of the invention comprises at least two and preferably at least three proteins of different sizes. More preferably, the ladders of the invention comprise 3-20, still more preferably 3-15, and still more preferably 3-10, proteins of different sizes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to a method for sizing one or more proteins or polypeptides of unknown size or molecular weight, comprising:\n\n \n \n \n(a) separating, according to size, the protein molecular weight ladder of the invention, and the one or more proteins or polypeptides of unknown size; and\n \n(b) determining the size and/or molecular weight of the protein(s) or polypeptide(s). Such determination may be made by comparison of the mobility of the unknown protein(s) or polypeptide(s) to that of the molecular weight ladder of the invention by standard techniques such as gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, etc.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also provides for stained polypeptides and stained molecular weight markers produced in accordance with the methods of the invention and to kits containing them, Such kits comprise a carrier means, such as a box, carton, or the like, being compartmentalized to receive in close confinement therein one or more container means such as tubes, vials, ampules, bottles or the like, wherein a first container means comprises one or more stained polypeptides of the invention or one or more of the stained molecular weight marker ladders of the invention. In one such aspect of the invention, a number of individual containers may be provided in a kit, each container containing a different sized (and/or type) stained polypeptide, such that the end user may selectively prepare different molecular weight markers having a different combination of differently sized proteins. Thus, the invention provides the end user with flexibility in making an appropriate marker ladder depending on the need. Moreover, kits of the invention may also provide separate containers containing differently stained polypeptides (\ne\n.\ng\n., stained with different dyes), thus providing the end user with flexibility not only in varying the size or pattern of the molecular weight ladder but also the color or colors attributed to the individual peptides or bands in the ladder.

In order to provide a clear and consistent understanding of the specification and claims, and the scope to be given such terms, the following definitions are provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"polypeptide,\" is used herein to mean a sequence of contiguous amino acids, of any length. As used herein, the terms \"peptide\" or \"protein\" may be used interchangeably with the term \"polypeptide.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"nucleic acid molecule\" as used herein refers to a sequence of contiguous nucleotides which may encode a full-length polypeptide or a fragment of any length thereof, or may be non-coding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"inclusion partner protein\" is used herein to mean any protein or fragment, portion, derivative or variant thereof which forms inclusion bodies upon expression in a host cell; nucleic acid molecules encoding inclusion partner proteins may be fused to those encoding polypeptides of interest in order to cause the polypeptide of interest to be co-expressed in the form of inclusion bodies in a host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"gene fusion construct\" as used herein means a nucleic acid molecule which is the product of the operative linkage or fusion of a nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide of interest to a nucleic acid molecule encoding an inclusion partner protein. A gene fusion construct as defined herein may include additional nucleic acid sequences comprising expression signals (such as promoters or enhancers) which are recognized by a host cell and which direct the expression of the gene fusion construct to produce the polypeptide of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrases \"substantially all of the polypeptides are complexed with a dye\" or \"substantially all of the polypeptides are stained with a dye\" or \"substantially all of the polypeptides are labeled with a dye\" may be used interchangeably and as used herein mean that substantially all of the polypeptides or proteins in a sample have been completely or substantially completely complexed, stained, or labeled with one or more dyes. Such completion of staining can be determined by any number of analytical techniques, although analysis of mobility and staining intensity by gel electrophoresis is preferred (see Examples below). For example, incomplete or partial staining of a protein sample results in a heterogeneous population of proteins, each of which may have a different mobility.during gel electrophoresis Upon complete or substantially complete staining, however, mobility will remain substantially unchanged even upon further staining (\ni\n.\ne\n., further incubation with dye). Thus, complete or substantially complete staining may be measured by such mobility changes, or the lack or substantial lack thereof. Alternatively or in addition to such mobility changes, completion of staining may be determined by changes in intensity of staining. Thus, upon complete or substantially complete staining in accordance with the invention, the stain intensity of a protein sample of interest, determined, for example, by gel electrophoresis, will not substantially change upon further staining (\ni.e\n., further incubation with dye).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a method for producing and isolating recombinant polypeptides from host cells, wherein the recombinant polypeptides are produced as inclusion bodies in the host cells. Specifically, the method involves (a) obtaining a host cell comprising a first nucleic acid molecule encoding a recombinant polypeptide operatively linked to a second nucleic acid molecule encoding an inclusion partner protein, thereby forming a gene fusion construct; and (b) cultivating the above host cell under conditions favoring production of the polypeptide as inclusion bodies in the host cell. The invention also provides the above method further comprising (c) isolating the inclusion bodies from the host cell, most preferably by centrifugation; and (d) releasing the polypeptide from the inclusion bodies. According to the present invention, the first nucleic acid molecule encoding the polypeptide may be obtained from a prokaryotic cell, particularly a bacterial cell and most particularly an \nEscherichia coli\n cell, or from a eukaryotic cell, particularly an animal cell, a plant cell or a yeast cell, more particularly a mammalian animal cell, and most particularly a human cell, and the second nucleic acid molecule encoding the inclusion partner protein may be obtained from any cell, preferably a bacterial cell, and most preferably an \nEscherichia coli\n cell. The inclusion partner protein used in the present invention may be any protein that forms an inclusion body upon expression in a host cell, and is preferably a bacterial protein, more preferably a bacterial thioredoxin or modified bacterial thioredoxin, and most preferably a carboy terminal-truncated form of \nE\n. \ncoli\n thioredoxin as described in more detail below. Preferably, the gene fusion construct is inserted into a vector prior to being introduced into the host cell. According to one aspect of the invention, the polypeptide of interest may be released from inclusion bodies, formed by the gene fusion construct, by cleavage with a chemical such as cyanogen bromide, or more preferably with an enzyme such as thrombin or enteroldnase. According to another aspect, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein-specific cleavage site may be placed between the nucleic acid sequence encoding the inclusion partner protein and the recombinant polypeptide in the gene fusion construct; upon expression of the fusion protein as inclusion bodies in the host cells, the recombinant polypeptide may then be released therefrom by treating the inclusion bodies with an enzyme or other chemical that specifically recognizes and cleaves at the protein-specific cleavage site. The invention also provides the above-described methods wherein the gene fusion construct comprises plasmid pTrcprl-monomer, and provides plasmid pTrcprl-monomer. The invention is also directed to the above-described methods wherein the host cell is a bacterial cell, most preferably an \nEscherichia coli\n cell, and wherein the vector used is an expression vector, most preferably plasmids pTrc99A or pTrxfus. The invention also provides these vectors, and host cells, particularly bacterial cells and most particularly \nEscherichia coli\n cells, comprising these vectors. The invention further provides recombinant polypeptides made by the above methods, plasmid pTrcprl-monomer, and plasmid pTrxA-concat.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment, the invention provides methods for making a protein molecular weight ladder, which is preferably prestained, and a protein molecular weight ladder produced by these methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the present invention is most particularly directed to methods for the production of a fragment of the gene 32 protein of bacteriophage T4, \nKpn\nI methylase, or Dead-Box protein, it will be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that using the methods of the present invention, any polypeptide comprising a sequence of contiguous amino acids of any length may be produced as inclusion bodies in a host cell and isolated therefrom.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGene Fusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe methods of the present invention utilize the technique of gene fusion to produce a gene fusion construct comprising the nucleic acid molecule encoding a first polypeptide operatively linked to a second nucleic acid molecule encoding an inclusion partner protein. The nucleic acid molecule encoding the first polypeptide may be obtained from a bacterial cell, particularly an \nE\n. \ncoli\n cells; from an animal cell, preferably a mammalian cell and most preferably a human cell; a plant cell; or a yeast cell. As described in more detail below, the nucleic acid molecule encoding the inclusion partner protein may be obtained from any cell, preferably from a bacterial cell, and most preferably from an \nEscherichia coli\n cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for construction of gene fusion constructs comprising a DNA sequence encoding a desired polypeptide, fused to a prokaryotic DNA sequence, are well-known in the art (\nsee\n, \ne.g\n., \nSambrook, J., et al., Molecular Clowning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed, Cold Spring Harbor, New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, pp. 17.2-17.9 (1989\n); \nAusubel, F.M., et al., eds., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, New York: John Wiley & S ons, Inc., pp. 16.4.1 - 16.8.14 (1994\n)). Other suitable methods that are routine to one of ordinary skill in the art may also be used equivalently in the methods of the present invention.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nVectors and Host Cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to vectors which comprise the isolated DNA molecules of the present invention, host cells which are genetically engineered with the recombinant vectors, and methods for the production of a recombinant polypeptide using these vectors and host cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe vector used in the present invention may be, for example, a phage or a plasmid, and is preferably a plasmid Preferred are vectors comprising \ncis\n-acting control regions to the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide of interest. Appropriate \ntrans\n-acting factors may be supplied by the host, supplied by a complementing vector or supplied by the vector itself upon introduction into the host.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain preferred embodiments in this regard, the vectors provide for specific expression, which may be inducible and/or cell type-specific. Particularly preferred among such vectors are those inducible by environmental factors that are easy to manipulate, such as temperature and nutrient additives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression vectors useful in the present invention include chromosomal-, episomal- and virus-derived vectors, e.g., vectors derived from bacterial plasmids or bactenophages, and vectors derived from combinations thereof such as cosmids and phagemids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA insert should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter, such as the phage lambda PL promoter, the \nE. coli lac\n, \ntrp\n and \ntac\n promoters. Other suitable promoters will be known to the skilled artisan. The gene fusion constructs will further contain sites for transcription initiation, termination and, in the transcribed region, a ribosome binding site for translation- The coding portion of the mature transcripts expressed by the constructs will preferably include a translation initiation codon at the beginning, and a termination codon (UAA, UGA or UAG) appropriately positioned at the end, of the polynucleotide to be translated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression vectors will preferably include at least one selectable marker. Such markers include tetracycline or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in \nE\n. \ncoli\n and other bacteria.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong vectors preferred for use in the present invention include pQE70, pQE60 and pQE-9, available from Qiagen; pBS vectors, Phagescript vectors, Bluescript vectors, pNH8A, pNH16a, pNH18A, pNH46A, available from Stratagene; pcDNA3 available from Invitrogen; and pGEX, pTrxfus, pTrc99a, pET-5, pET-9, pKK223-3, pKK233-3, pDR540, pRIT5 available from Pharmacia. Other suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative examples of appropriate host cells include, but are not limited to, bacterial cells such as \nE\n. \ncoli\n, \nStreptomyces\n spp., \nErwinia\n spp., \nKlebsiella\n spp. and \nSalmonella typhimurium.\n Preferred as a host cell is \nE\n. \ncoli,\n and particularly preferred are \nE\n. \ncoli\n strains DH10B and Stbl2, which are available commercially (Life Technologies, Inc; Rockville, Maryland).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInclusion Partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIt has been unexpectedly discovered in the present invention that use of a modified version of the gene encoding the inclusion partner protein will induce the host cell to produce the fusion protein, comprising the polypeptide of interest, as intracellular inclusion bodies. As used herein, the term \"modified version of a gene\" means a version of a gene comprising an alteration of the normal or most commonly encountered sequence of the gene, which results in the expression of the encoded protein, in a fused or unfused state, in inclusion bodies in a host cell. Such alterations may include, but are not limited to, deletions, substitutions, insertions, point mutations, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred inclusion partner proteins for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, modified versions of \nE\n. \ncoli\n maltose-binding protein (\nBetton and Hofnug, J. Biol Chem. 271:8046-9052 (1996\n)), \nE. coli\n RNAse II (\nCoburn and Mackie, J. Biol. Chem. 271:1048-1053 (1996\n)), \nE. coli\n alkaline phosphatase (\nDerman and Beckwith, J.

Biochem. 215:481-486 (1993\n)), T5 DNA polymerase (\nChatterjee et al., Gene 97:13-19 (1991\n)), and \nE. coli\n thioredoxin (\nHoog et al., BioSci. Rep. 4:917-923 (1984\n)) More preferable for use in the present invention is a modified \nE\n. \ncoli\n thioredoxin, which as used herein is a thioredoxin protein having the ability to form inclusion bodies (in fused or unfused constructs) upon expression in a host cell. Particularly preferred is a deletion mutant of the \nE\n. \ncoli\n thioredoxin encoded by the \ntrx\nA gene, and most particularly the carboxy terminal-truncated form of \nE. cali trx\nA having a nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:8. hereinafter designated pTrxA-concat. The recombinant host cell comprising pTrxA-concat, \nE\n. \ncoli\n DH10B(pTrxA-concat), was deposited on January 6, 1997, with the Collection, Agricultural Research Culture Collection (NRRL), 1815 North University Street, Peoria, Illinois 61604 USA, as Deposit No NRRL B-21653.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTruncated versions of \ntrx\nA that may be used in the present invention include those wherein 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 49 or 50 amino acids are deleted from the carboxy terminus of thioredoxin, preferably those wherein 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 or 33 ammo acids are deleted, and most preferably those wherein 23 amino acids are deleted (pTrxfusprl10A).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for making and expressing modified gene fusion constructs, such as a construct encoding a modified or truncated thioredoxin, are well-known to one of ordinary skill in the art and are amply described in the literature (\nsee, e.g\n., \nWinnacker, From Genes to Clones, New York: VCH Publishers, pp 451-481 (1987\n)), and in detail in the Examples below. To determine if a particular modified gene fusion construct induces the production of inclusion bodies in a host cell, the construct may be transferred into a host cell and expressed as described below. A suspension of host cells may then be examined for the presence of inclusion bodies by any means, such as microscopy (\ne\n.\ng\n., phase contrast, Nomarski interference, electron or fluorescence microscopy), suitable for the detection af the presence of inclusion bodies within individual host cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor use in the present invention, the inclusion partner nucleic acid sequence may be inserted into the chromosome of the host cell, or in a vector which is preferably an expression vector. Particularly preferred as expression vectors in the present invention are well-known expression vectors such as pAR (for \nlac\nZ), pATH (for \ntrp\nE), pMAL (for \nmal\nE), pGEX (for GST), or pTrxfus (for \ntrx\nA). These vectors and others that may also be suitable are available commercially, for example from Pharmacia (Piscataway, New Jersey). Alternatively, other well-characterized vectors known in the art may be used to carry out the methods of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, the methods of the present invention are suitable for production of any polypeptide of any length, and are particularly suitable for producing short polypeptides, or those that are toxic to the host cells, which otherwise would not be expressed by the host cells in significant quantities. Methods for isolation of nucleic acid sequences encoding a polypeptide of interest from a variety of sources are wefl-known in the art (\nsee\n, \ne.g\n., \nSambrook, J., et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed, Cold Spring Harbor, New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, (1989\n)) Once the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide of interest has been isolated, it is operatively linked or fused to the modified inclusion partner nucleic acid from above, forming a vector, preferably an expression vector, comprising the gene fusion construct to be used in transforming the host cells Particularly preferred as a gene fusion construct is plasmid ptcprl-monomer. Methods for fusion of the nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest to a truncated inclusion partner nucleic acid sequence, and insertion into an expression vector are routine to one of ordinary skill in the art (\nsee\n, \ne.g\n., \nAusubel, F.M., et al., eds., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., pp. 16.4.1 - 16.8.14 (1994\n)).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExpression of Recombinant Protein as Inclusion Bodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor use in the present invention, the gene fusion construct may be inserted into the chromosome of the host cell, or in a vector which is preferably an expression vector. Introduction of the gene fusion construct into the host cell to produce a transformed host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, infection or other methods. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals, such as Davis \net al\n., \nBasic Methods In Molecular Biology\n (1986). Once transformed host cells have been obtained, the cells may be cultivated under any physiologically compatible conditions of pH and temperature, in any suitable nutrient medium containing assimilable sources of carbon, nitrogen and essential minerals that support host cell growth. Recombinant protein-producing cultivation conditions will vary according to the type of vector used to transform the host cells For example, certain expression vectors comprise regulatory regions which require cell growth at certain temperatures, or addition of certain chemicals or inducing agents to the cell growth medium, to initiate the gene expression resulting in the production of the recombinant polypeptide Thus, the term \"recombinant polypeptide-producing conditions,\" as used herein, is not meant to be limited to any one set of cultivation conditions. Appropriate culture media and conditions for the above-described host cells and vectors are well-known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been unexpectedly found in the present invention that cultivating the host cells transformed with the gene fusion constructs provided herein will result in the production of the recombinant polypeptide of interest as inclusion bodies. Thus, routine recombinant polypeptide-producing conditions may therefore be considered to favor production of the recombinant polypeptide as inclusion bodies in the host cell, and may be used to produce recombinant polypeptides as inclusion bodies according to the present invention; the use of unusual culture conditions or undue experimentation are not required.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIsolation and Purification of Recombinant Polypeptide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs is well-known to one of ordinary skill in the art, methods for the production of polypeptides by recombinant DNA techniques typically are designed to \nminimize\n the production of the polypeptides in inclusion bodies in the host cells, due to perceived and real difficulties in isolating the polypeptides from the inclusion bodies. According to the present invention, however, the production of a recombinant polypeptide in inclusion bodies may be used advantageously to provide for the rapid isolation and purification of the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing its production as inclusion bodies in the host cells, the gene fusion product comprising the polypeptide of interest may be isolated by several techniques. To liberate the inclusion bodies from the host cells, the cells must be lysed or ruptured This lysis may be accomplished by contacting the cells with a hypotonic solution, by treatment with a cell wall-disrupting enzyme such as lysozyme, by sonication, by treatment with high pressure, or by a combination of the above methods Other methods of bacterial cell disruption and lysis that are known to one of ordinary skill may also be used. Preferably, bacterial cells are ruptured by treatment with lysozyme followed by sonication; such treatment will yield a mixture of cellular debris comprising the inclusion bodies, which are not disrupted by this treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing disruption, the inclusion bodies are separated from the cellular debris by any technique suitable for separation of particles in complex mixtures. Preferred such techniques include centrifugation, or the use of an automated particle separator such as those commercially available from, for example, Coulter Electronics (Hialeah, Florida). Most preferred for isolating inclusion bodies is centrifugation. By the present invention, inclusion bodies may be isolated by centrifuging the cellular debris mixture from above at about 1-25,000 x \ng\n, preferably at about 100-20,000 x \ng\n, more preferably at about 5,000-15,000 x \ng\n, and most preferably at about 10,000 x \ng\n. Preferably, centrifugation is conducted at about 4°-10°C for about 15-60 minutes, most preferably at about 4°C for about 30 minutes. Following centrifugation, the cellular debris contained in the supernatant is removed from the pelleted inclusion bodies and the pellet used for purification of the recombinant polypeptide of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preparation for purification, the gene fusion product contained in the inclusion bodies, comprising the recombinant polypeptide, is solubilized. Solubilization is preferably accomplished by treatment with a denaturing agent, preferably guanidinium hydrochloride or urea, and most preferably about 8M urea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to, during or following solubilization of the inclusion bodies, the recombinant polypeptide of interest may optionally be cleaved from the inclusion partner protein by techniques that are well-described in the art (\nsee\n, \ne.g\n., \nAusubel, F.M., el al., eds., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., pp 16.4.5 - 16.4.17 (1994\n)). It will be understood by one of ordinary skill, however, that production of recombinant polypeptides by the present invention does not necessarily require such cleavage. This cleavage may be accomplished by a chemical cleavage method, for example by contacting the inclusion bodies with a polypeptide-releasing amount of a chemical cleavage agent under conditions favoring the release of the polypeptide from the inclusion bodies. Preferred chemical cleavage agents include cyanogen bromide, hydroxylamine, or low pH solutions (acid hydrolysis). Alternatively, and more preferably, cleavage of the inclusion partner protein is accomplished by an enzymatic cleavage method, preferably by contacting the inclusion bodies with a polypeptide-releasing amount of an enzymatic cleavage agent under conditions favoring the release of the polypeptide from the inclusion bodies. Preferred enzymatic cleavage agents include factor Xa (for gene fusion products comprising a \nmal\nE or GST inclusion partner) or thrombin (for gene fusion products comprising a GST inclusion partner), and particularly preferred is erterokinase (for gene fusion products comprising a \ntrx\nA inclusion partner). These chemical and enzymatic cleavage methods are preferably carried out under conditions favoring the release of the polypeptide from the inclusion bodies, which are well-known to one of ordinary skill in the art (\nsee, e.g\n., \nAusubel, F.M., et al., eds., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., pp. 16.4.5 - 16.4-17 (1994\n)). Such release may result in solubilixation of the peptide of interest and thus further solubilization may be unnecessary. Alternatively, cleavage of the inclusion partner protein from the polypeptide may be facilitated during the formation of the gene fusion construct. In such a scheme, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein-specific cleavage site may be placed between the nucleic acid sequence encoding the inclusion partner protein (such as the modified thioredoxin) and the recombinant polypeptide in the gene fusion construct; upon expression of the fusion protein as inclusion bodies in the host cells, the recombinant polypeptide may then be isolated by treating the inclusion bodies with an enzyme (such as thrombin or enterokinase) or a chemical (such as cyanogen bromide) that specifically recognizes and cleaves at the protein-specific cleavage site. Cleavage of the inclusion partner protein may alternatively be performed during or following any of the subsequent steps described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter solubilization, the gene fusion product or the cleaved recombinant polypeptide may be refolded by dialysis to remove the denaturing agent. Dialysis is preferably performed for about 18-48 hours at about 4°C against an isotonic buffered salt solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing solubilization and optional refolding, the gene fusion product or cleaved recombinant polypeptide may be purified by any of a variety of protein purification techniques that are well-known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Suitable techniques for purification include, but are not limited to, ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, electrophoresis, immunoadsorption, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, immunoaffinity chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, liquid chromatography (LC), high performance LC (HPLC), fast performance LC (FPLC), hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. Most preferably LC, HPLC or FPLC is employed for purification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, any recombinant polypeptide may be produced and isolated from host cells by the methods of the present invention. In particular, it is possible to produce recombinant thioredoxin by these methods. In such a scheme, thioredoxin, or a fragment thereof, may be produced by a series of steps comprising (a) modifying the thioredoxin gene, (b) transferring the modified thioredoxin gene to a host cell, and (c) culturing the host cell under conditions favoring production of thioredoxin as inclusion bodies in the host cell These modification, transfer and culture steps may be carried out for thioredoxin as described above for production of any polypeptide, and as described in more detail in the Examples below.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nProduction of Protein Molecular Weight Ladders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the methods of the present invention may be used to prepare a protein molecular weight ladder to be used as a molecular weight or molecular sizing standard in protein analysis techniques such as electrophoresis. In this embodiment, described in greater detail below in Examples 3-9, a series of fusion proteins may be made, wherein the inclusion partner protein is linked to one or more recombinant polypeptides or fragments thereof For example, a nucleic acid molecule encoding a modified thioredoxin inclusion partner protein may be inserted into a vector, preferably an expression vector, to form a fusion vector such as plasmid pTrxA-concat (\nFigure 4\n; SEQ ID NO:8). This vector may then be linked to single or multiple fragments of a recombinant polypeptide such as thioredoxin (\nFigure 5\n; SEQ ID NO:11), \nE. coli\n Dead-Box protein (\nFigure 6\n; SEQ ID NO: 14), \nKpn\nI methylase (\nFigure 7\n; SEQ ID NO:17) or 264-bp modified T4 gene 32 protein (\nFigure 1\n; SEQ ID NO:1), each of a chosen size (\ne\n.\ng\n., 5 kD or 10 kD). After insertion of the nucleic acid molecule or vector into the host cell (\ni.e\n., transformation of the host cell), the polypeptides may then be produced by expression of the nucleic acid molecules in the host cells. It will be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that several expression scenarios are possible. For example, the methods of the present invention may be used to produce a nucleic acid molecule encoding a plurality of the polypeptides forming the molecular weight ladder, or to produce multiple nucleic acid molecules each of which encodes a different molecular weight polypeptide of the ladder. Host cells may then be transformed with a nucleic acid encoding a plurality of such polypeptides, or with multiple nucleic acid molecules each encoding a different molecular weight polypeptide. Alternatively, multiple host cells may be transformed, each with a single nucleic acid molecule encoding a different polypeptide of the molecular weight ladder; in this scenario, polypeptides produced by the host cells will be admixed to form the molecular weight ladder. In each of these scenarios, expression of these constructs will preferably produce inclusion bodies in the host cells comprising polypeptides from as small as 5-10 kD to as large as 250-330 kD. Furthermore, the molecular weight increments of the ladder produced by the present methods may be defined by simply altering the length or number of copies of the recombinant polypeptide gene linked to the inclusion partner protein gene fusion construct. Thus, it is possible according to the present invention to produce a protein ladder comprising a collection of proteins ranging, for example, from about 5 kD to about 300 kD, preferably from about 5 kD to about 250 kD, and more preferably from about 10 kD to about 220 kD, in increments of, for example, 5 kD, 10 kD, 20 kD, 25 kD, 50 kD, 100 kD or larger, Of course, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill that other molecular weight or sizing increments may be more suitable for certain applications, and may be prepared by only minor modifications of the present methods (such as by increasing or decreasing the length of the gene encoding the fused recombinant polypeptide as described above); such methods and compositions may thus be provided without departing from the scope of the present invention or any embodiment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the protein molecular weight ladders prepared as described above may be unstained, or may be prestained with one or more protein-binding dyes to facilitate the use of the ladders in techniques requiring prestained protein ladders such as Western blotting. According to the invention, any of a number of protein-binding dyes may be used to stain proteins or the molecular weight ladders of the invention, to produce the prestained ladders of the invention. Any dye that binds covalently to one or more of the ladder proteins may be used, including visible dyes (chromophores), fluorescent dyes (fluorophores), phosphorescent dyes (phosphors) and the like. Preferred dyes in this regard include, but are not limited to, remazol brilliant blue R (RBBR), eosin isothiocyanate, malachite green isothiocyanate, reactive orange (also known as procion yellow), procion red, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine isothiocyanate, eosin iodoacetamide, reactive black 5, Remasol brilliant violet 5R, \nreactive orange\n 14, and the like. Particularly preferred for use in the present methods are RBBR, eosin isothiocyanate and malachite green isothiocyanate. These and other dyes that may be used in the present methods are available commercially, for example from Sigma/Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention, prestained molecular weight ladders may be produced by incubating one or more of the ladder proteins, which may be naturally occurring or produced recombinantly as directed above, with one or more of the above-noted dyes in a buffered aqueous solution under conditions of controlled temperature, time, and solution pH. Preferably, the ladder proteins are suspended in a buffered aqueous solution (such as a Tris-, phosphate-, carbonate-, or HEPES- buffered saline solution comprising NaCl at about 10-300 mM, preferably at about 50-200 mM) at a concentration of about 0.1 to about 25, about 0.1 to 10, or about 0.5 to 10 A\n280\n units/ml, more preferably at a concentration of about 1-10, about 1-5, or about 1-4 A\n280\n units/ml. To the solution of protein(s), one or more of the above dyes may be added at concentration ranges that are specific for each dye, typically in the range of about 0.2 mg/ml to about 1000 mg/ml, about 0.2 mg/ml to about 500 mg/ml, about 0.2 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml, about 5 mg/ml to about 200 mg/ml, about 10 mg/ml to about 200 mg/ml, or about 10 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml For example, RBBR may be added to the protein solution at a final concentration of about 0.3-50 mg/ml, preferably at about 5-40 mg/ml, and more preferably about 10-30 mg/ml Eosin isothiocyanate may be added to the protein solution at a final concentration of about 1-30 mg/ml, and more preferably about 7-10 mg/ml. Malachite green isothiocyanate may be added to the protein solution at a final concentration of about 5-30 mg/ml, more preferably about 20-30 mg/ml. Optimal concentrations for other dyes that may be used to stain the proteins and molecular weight ladders according to the present methods may be determined by one of ordinary skill without undue experimentation, using the above-noted concentration ranges as guidelines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe staining of the protein ladders should also be conducted under conditions of controlled solution pH and/or temperature. Preferably, the solution is buffered to a pH (measured at about room temperature (\ni\n.\ne\n., about 20°C-25°C) prior to addition of the proteins, ladders, and dye(s)) of about 7-12, about 7-11, about 8-11. or about 8.5-10.5, preferably about 7.2-9.7, more preferably about 8.2-9.7, and most preferably about 9.2-9.7 During the staining reaction, the solutions should be incubated at a temperature of about 4°C to about 90°C, about 4°C to about 80°C, preferably at about room temperature (\ni\n.\ne\n., about 20°C-25°C) to about 80°C, about 35°C to about 80°C, about 40°C to about 75°C, about 45°C to about 70°C, about 45°C to about 70°C, about 50°C to about 70°C, about 45°C to about 65°C, more preferably at a temperature of about 50°C to about 60°C, and most preferably at a temperature of about 50°C. For production of stained proteins or ladders, the protein-dye solutions should be incubated under the above-noted conditions for about 4-48 hours, prefrably about 6-48 hours, more preferably about 4-24 hours, about 6-24 hours, about 8-24 hours, about 10-24 hours, about 12-24 hours, and most preferably about 12-18 hours (\ni.e\n., \"overnight,\" as that term will be understood by the skilled artisan) Following incubation, the stained protein(s) or molecular weight ladders may be isolated from unconjugated dye and any other impurities by a variety of art-known methods (\ne.g\n., dialysis, chromatography, gel diffusion, etc.), and may be stored in solution at -70°C to 4°C, or they may be lyophilized and stored at -70°C to room temperature (\ni\n.\ne\n., about 20°C-25°C) until use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particularly preferred such embodiment, the prestained protein ladder may comprise a collection of protein molecular weight markers that are evenly spaced on SDS-PAGE and that further comprise a reference protein band stained with a different color from the other bands, to allow easy orientation of all of the bands on the gel. For example, such a prestained ladder preparation may comprise a collection of bands wherein one band (a reference band) is stained with eosin isothiocyanate and the remaining bands are stained with RBBR Such an approach is described in full detail in Example 4 below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant arts that other suitable modifications and adaptations to the methods and applications described herein are obvious and may be made without departing from the scope of the invention or any embodiment thereof. Having now described the present invention in detail, the same will be more clearly understood by reference to the following examples, which are included herewith for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting of the invention.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following materials and methods were generally used in the examples, unless otherwise specified in a particular example.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMaterials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAll enzymes including restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, Taq DNA polymerase and thermosensitive alkaline phosphatase were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (LTI; Rockville, Maryland) unless otherwise stated. The \nE. coli\n expression vector pTrc99A was obtained from Pharmacia (Piscataway, New Jersey); pTrxfus was from Genetics Institute (Cambridge, Massachusetts) or Invitrogen (San Diego, Califarnia), pRE1 was obtained from Dr. McKenney (\nReddy et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 17:10473-10488 (1989\n)). Toyo-Pearl AF chelate-650M resin was purchased from TosoHaas (Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania). The \nE. coli\n expression host DH10B with or without pRK248cl (tetracycline\nr\n) and Stbl2 were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, Maryland).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRemasol brilliant blue R (RBBR) and malachite green were obtained from Aldrich and eosin isothiocyanate was obtained from Molecular Probes. Bovine aprotinin was obtained from Bayer. The cloned proteins were purified, as fully described below, from \nE. coli\n strains which contained plasmids coding for eight proteins ranging in size from 10 kDa to 160 kDa The buffer components were all reagent grade or higher. The diafiltration unit was a Filtron Mini Ultrasette equipped with an Omega 3000 molecular weight cutoff membrane. G-25 medium resin was obtained from Pharmacia. Other reagents and components were obtained from commercial laboratory supply sources that will be familiar to the skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRecombinant DNA construction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA 264 bp (SEQ ID NO:1) \nAva\nI fragment was derived from pPrL2107 (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,449,758\n \n). This fragment is a part of T4 gene 32 protein which has been highly modified. This \nAva\nI fragment was used to make multimers (see \n \nU.S. patent 5,449,758\n \n) in pPrL2001. A clone with 12 inserts was selected and was designated as pPrl 2738. The cloned fragment was recloned in pTrc99A as follows: the recombinant plasmid was digested with \nEco\nR1 and blunt ended with Klenow fragment in the presence of dNTPs; digested with \nNco\nI and the fragment was purified by GENE CLEAN™ (Bio101). The vector, pTrc99A, was digested with \nSal\nI, blunt ended with Klenow fragment, and digested with \nNco\nI. The gel purified vector was ligated with the gel purified fragment and transformed into DH10B. The clone was designated as pTrcprl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo make a monomer, pTrcprl was completely digested with \nAva\nI to remove multimers and the vector was self-ligated. This construct contains a 261 bp (SEQ ID NO:2) fragment with a single \nAva\nI site and was expected to produce a 10 kD protein. The plasmid was designated as pTrcprl-monomer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo generate clones to produce individual proteins from 20 kD to 220 kD, the 264 bp \nAva\nI fragment from pPrL2107 was used to make multimers in pTrcprl-monomer at the \nAva\nI site. Since the 264 bp fragment (SEQ ID NO:1) contains an interval methionine residue, it was altered to a lysine residue by site-directed mutagenesis in order to stop any internal initiation. The ligation was carried out at room temperature (22°C) by using 100:1 pmol ratio of insert and vector. Individual clones with correct inserts (two, three, four, etc.) were selected by the size of the insert after digestion with \nNco\nI and \nHin\ndIII. The plasmids were designated as pTrcprl20, pTrcprl30, pTreprl40, and so on, to produce 20 kD, 30 kD, 40 kD, etc. proteins respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA clone was also generated which contained a part of \nE. coli\n thioredoxin (truncated) under control of the lambda pL promoter to produce a 10 kD protein. This construct contained 86 out of 108 amino acids of thioredoxin plus six histidine residues at the carboxy end, which provided a His tag to facilitate purification of the expressed protein. In alternative approaches, a maximum of 33 amino acids were deleted from the thioredoxin protein, producing a construct comprising 75 out of 108 amino acids of thioredoxin plus the His tag. The oligonucleotides used to clone the fragment were T CTA AGG AAA TAC TTA \n \nCAT ATG\n \n AGC G (SEQ ID NO:3) and TA TTA \n \nCTG CAG\n \n TTA GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG TTC ACC GTT TTT GAA CAG CAG CAG (SEQ ID NO:4). The oligonucleotides were used for PCR using pTrxEus as a template. The PCR product was digested with \nNde\nI and \nPst\nI (incorporated in the oligonucleotides underlined) and cloned into pTrxfus digested with \nNde\nI and \nPst\nI\n.\n The plasmid was designated as pTrxfusprl10A (SEQ ID NO:5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe oligonucleotides TAA TAA \n \n \nCCA TGG\n CAT ATG\n \n AGC GAT AAA ATT ATT CAC (SEQ ID NO:6) and ATT ATA \n \nCCC GAG\n \n TCC ACC ACG GAT GCC ATA TTT CGG (SEQ ID NO:7) with \nNeo\nI (bold, underlined and italics), \nNde\nI (bold italics) and \nAva\nI (bold underlined) were used to generate an alternative vector for making multimers as follows: The oligonucleotides were used to generate a PCR product using pTrxfus as a template. The PER product was digested with \nNco\nI and \nAva\nI and cloned into pTrcprl-monomer to replace the \nNco\nI\n-Ava\nI fragment of modified T4 gene 32 gene. This plasmid was designated as pTrxA-concat (SEQ ID NO:8). This construct contained amino acids 1-75 from thioredoxin, glycine as the 76th amino acid, and amino acids 77-90 from pTrcprl-monomer including the 6 carboky-terminal histidine residues. This construct was made to generate fusion proteins by in-fiarne ligation of an \nAva\nI fragment or multimers of \nAva\nI fragment as discussed above. To make multimers, we have used \nAva\nI fragments generated by PCR from several test genes such as thioredoxin, DEAD-box or \nKpn\nI methylase. The oligonucleotides used to generate an \nAva\nI fragment from the thioredoxin gene (\nHoog et al., Bioscience Reports 4:917-923 (1984\n)) were: TAA TAA \n \nCTC GGG\n \n AGC GAT AAA ATT ATT CAC CTG (SEQ ID NO:9) and ATA ATA \n \nCCC GAG\n \n TTT GGT TGC CGC CAC TTC ACC (SEQ ID NO:10). The PCR product (SEQ ID NO:11) was digested with \nAva\nI and ligated to \nAva\nI digested and dephosphorylated pTrxA-concat using 100 pmol of insert and 1 pmol of vector. Clones with single or multiple inserts were selected by estimating the size of the insert after digestion with \nNco\nI and \nPst\nI\n.\n Finally, the desired inserts were cloned as \nNde\nI\n-Pst\nI fragment into pTrxfus Thus, these clones will produce thioredoxin-(thioredoxin)\nn\n fusion proteins as 20 kD, 30 kD, 40 kD, etc. The oligonucleotides used to generate an \nAva\nI fragment from DEAD-box gene (\nToone et al., J. Bacterial. 173(11):3291-3302 (1991\n)) were TAA TAA \n \nCTC GGG\n \n AAG CTG ACT AAT CCG GAA GTA G (SEQ ID NO:12) and ATT ATT \n \nCCC GAG\n \n CAG TGC GCG GTA TTG ATC CAG (SEQ ID NO:13). The PCR product (SEQ ID NO:14) was generated using \nE. coli\n chromosome as template. The PCR product digested with \nAva\nI and ligated with pTrxA-concat as above. Clones with various inserts were selected and recloned in pTrxfus as above. These clones were designed to produce thioredoxin-(DEAD-box)\nn\nfusion proteins as 15 kD, 20 kD, 25 kD, etc. To make thioredoxin-\nKpn\nI methylase fusions proteins, the oligonucleotides used were GA TTA \n \nCTC GGG\n \n GCA CAT AAA ATG CTA AAA GAT ACA (SEQ ID NO:15) and TC TAA \n \nCCC GAG\n \n TAA GAT CGT TTT TCT TGA ACC ACC (SEQ ID NO:16). The template used for PCR was a \nKpn\nI methylase clone (\nChatterjee et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 19:6505-6509 (1991\n)). The PCR product (SEQ ID NO:17) was digested with \nAva\nI and ligated to pTrxA-concat and finally, an \nNde\nI-\nPst\nI fragment was subcloned into pTrxfus plasmid. This plasmid was generated to produce a 40 kD thoredoxin-\nKpn\nI methylase fusion protein.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExpression of proteins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nE. coli\n DH10B or Stb12 (LTI; Rockville, Maryland) containing pTrcpr1 constructs were grown at 37°C in buffer-rich media containing ampicillin at 100µg/ml. Clones were grown to an OD\n590\n=1.0 and induced for 3 hours with IPTG to a final concentration of 1mM. Clones were incubated at 37°C for 3 hours. pTrxfus constructs were grown at 30°C in buffer-rich media containing ampicillin at 100 µg/ml and tetracycline at 15 µg/ml. Clones were grown to an OD\n590\n=1.0 and induced by heating to 42°C for 30 minutes followed a 3 hour outgrowth at 37°C. Cells were resuspended in 1ml of sonication buffer (10mM Tris-HCI 7.5, 1mM EDTA, and 10mM β-mercaptoethanol) followed by sonicating for 3 X 10 seconds. Removed 100µl for whole cell extract. An aliquot was removed to analyze proteins as total protein. The sonicated sample was spun for 10 minutes at 4°C and transferred supernatant to an eppendorf tube (soluble).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples (total and soluble fractions) were applied to a 4-20% tris-glycine gel to examine protein.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPurification of proteins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cells were slurried in a 1g:2mL ratio of 20mM Tris-HCl, 2mM MgCl\n2\n, pH 8.0 buffer. Benzonase, a recombinant endonuclease from American International Chemical, was added at a ratio of 25 units per mL of slurry. The cells were cracked with two passes through a high pressure laboratory homogenizer, Model MINI-LAB, type 7.30VH mm from APV Rannie, at 12,000 psi. The sample was then spun at 10,000 x g for 30 minutes in an RC -5 centrifuge to pellet the inclusion bodies while leaving most of the cell debris in the supernatant liquid. The inclusion body pellet was then washed twice at about 20-25°C with sterile water using an Ultra Torrax Tissuemizer from Tekmar to fully suspend the pellet. The pellet was then made soluble in 8M Urea, 100mM H\n2\nNaPO\n4\n, 4mM imidazole, pH 8.4 buffer and loaded on to a Toyopearl AF Chelate -650M resin from TosoHaas. Before loading the sample, the resin was charged with 3 column volumes of a 1M nickel sulfate solution, washed with three column volumes of water and then equilibrated with three column volumes of 8M urea, 100mM H\n2\nNaPO\n4\n, 4mM imidazole, pH 8.4 (buffer). After loading the sample, the column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer, and the protein was then eluted in a single faction with 8M urea, 100mM H\n2\nNaPO\n4\n, pH 3.5, and precipitated via dialysis against water containing 5 mM EDTA; EDTA was included to chelate free nickel ions which degraded the proteins upon long-term storage. The precipitate was spun down at 10,000 x g in an RC-5 centrifuge and then solubilized in 1% SDS/water.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRemasol Brilliant Blue R Labeling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 70, 100, and 160 kDa proteins were diluted in 1% SDS H\n2\nO to 8 A\n280\n units/ml. Each protein solution was combined with an equal volume of the buffer 280 mM sodium phosphate, 160 mM sodium chloride, 1 %(w/v) SDS, pH 9.2, and warmed to 50°C for 15 minutes. Stock solutions of RBBR (20 mg/ml and 60 mg/ml) were prepared in 140 mM sodium phosphate, 80 mM sodium chloride, 1% (w/v) SDS, pH 9.2, vortexed, and incubated for 15 minutes at 50°C. The 10, 15, 20, 30, 70, and 160 kDa protein solutions were then individually mixed with an equal volume of the warmed 60 mg/ml RBBR stock, vortexed, and incubated for 14-18 hours at 50°C. The 40 and 100kDa protein solutions were mixed individually with an equal volume of the warmed 20 mg/ml RBBR stock, vortexed, and incubated for 14-18 hours at 50°C. Following incubation, solutions were removed from the waterbath, allowed to equilibrate to room temperature, filtered through a 0.8µm cameo filter to remove any residual particulate, and stored at 4°C until use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo provide a low molecular weight standard, aprotinin was prepared at a concentration of 11 mg/ml in 140 mM sodium phosphate, 80 mM sodium chloride, 3%(w/v) SDS. The solution was gently vortexed and warmed to 50°C for 15 minutes. After warming, 5.7 mg of RBBR/ml was added to the solution, and the solution was then mixed and incubated for 40 minutes at 70°C. β-mercaptoethanol was then added (6.9 µl/ml), and the solution was again mixed and incubated for an additional 10 minutes at 70°C, after which 9.1 µl/ml of acrylonitrile was added. The solution was mixed, incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature, and then filtered through a 0.8 µm cameo filter cartridge and stored at 4°C.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEosin Isothiocyanate Labeling of the 50kDa Protein\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe 8 A\n280\n/\nml\n 50 kDa stock in 1% SDS/H\n2\nO was combined with an equal volume of 280 mM sodium phosphate, 160 mM sodium chloride, 1% (w/v) SDS, pH 9.7 buffer, mixed, and warmed for 15 minutes at 50°C. A 70 mg/ml stock of eosin isothiocyanate (EITC) was prepared in dimethylformamide immediately before use, and a sufficient volume of this solution was added to the 50 kDa protein solution to achieve a final concentration of 7 mg/ml EITC. The solution was then mixed, incubated at 50°C for 14-18 hours in the dark, equilibrated to room temperature, filtered through a 0.8µm cameo filter cartridge, and stored in the dark at 4°C.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreparation of Final Mixture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe quality of the labeling was assessed by running each protein stock on SDS-PAGE (\nLaemmli. E.K., Nature 227:680-685 (1970\n)), then preparing a mix of all of the proteins so that the amounts of the proteins produce bands which appear visually to have equivalent intensities. The mix was then diafiltered using a 3,000 molecular weight cutoff miniultrasette unit with 10% glycerol, 50 mM TRIS, 5 mM EDTA (to enhance stability of the preparation upon storage), pH 6.8 buffer. A Sephadex G-25 column was used to remove a small amount of unreacted dye which remained after diafiltration. The Sephadex column that was equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, 1% (w/v) SDS, 5 mM EDTA, pH 6.8, and the column size was 15 times the volume of the sample. SDS PAGE was carried out on the final mixture to assess the quality of the mix\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 1: Cloning and expression of a 10 kD Protein\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe initial objective was to make a protein molecular weight standard ranging from 10 kD-250 kD with 10 kD increments. Therefore, a modified portion of T4 gene 32 protein containing 87 amino acids (261 bp) that includes 6 histidine residues at the carboxy end (\nFigure 1\n; SEQ ID NO:1) (\nsee\n \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,449,758\n \n) was used. The fragment was donned and expressed to produce a 10 kD protein. The clone was designated as plasmid pTrcprl-monomer. This construct contains an unique \nAva\nI site (CTCGGG) to generate multimers of any given \nAva\nI fragment with CTCGGG sequence. When digested with \nAva\nI, the clone generates a TCGG overhang. Thus, when a DNA fragment having a TCGG overhang at both ends is ligated with \nAva\nI-digested pTrcpr1-monomer, the fragment will be ligated only in one direction (head-to-tail). Using proper legation condition, it was possible to generate multimers of a desired fragment For example, if a single \nAva\nI fragment (264 bp) is ligated to pTrcpr1-monomer it will produce a 20 kD protein; if two fragments are ligated, it will produce a 30 kD protein; and so on.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, the pTrcprl-monomer was designed to produce a 10 kD protein However, the induced or uninduced cultures did not produce any 10 kD protein. Interestingly, the larger clones with multiple inserts produced proteins of expected sizes. The level of expression, however, varied among the clones depending on the number of inserts. The level of expression of various proteins (in kD) was as follows: 20<30 <40 <50 <60 <70≅80≅90≅100≅120 >160 >180 >200 >220 >250.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo obtain a protein of low molecular weight for use in the production of molecular weight standards, natural proteins close to 10 kD in size that are well-expressed in \nE. coli\n were sought. One such protein is thioredoxin, which consists of 108 amino acids and which has a molecular mass of 12 kD (\nLunn et al., J. Biol.Chem. 259:10469-10474 (1984\n); \nHoog et al., BioSci Rep. 4:917-923 (1984\n)). Thiaredoxin is ubiquitously distributed, and is present in an unusually high concentration per cell (10,000-20,000 molecules/cell). In addition, it has also been shown that when overexpressed, it represents almost 40% of the total soluble cellular protein (Lunn \net al., Id\n.). It thus appeared that thioredoxin might be a suitable candidate for the production of a 10 kD protein if a 2 kD portion was deleted from its carboxy terminus. One such construct (pTrxfuspr110A) which produced a 10 kD protein contained: a) amino acids 1-85 from thioredoxin; b) a substitution of glutamic acid for valine at amino acid position number 86; and c) histidine residues at positions 87-92. This truncated thioredoxin construct produced about 20-30% of the total cellular protein. However, unlike full length thioredoxin this construct produced almost all of the induced protein as inclusion bodies. In other experiments, 33 of the 108 amino acids were deleted from the thioredoxin carboxy terminus; such constructs also produced almost all of the induced protein as inclusion bodies upon expression in the host cells. It may also be possible to produce polypeptides by the present methods using truncated thioredoxin in which 2-22 amino acids have been deleted from the carboxy terminus, or in which 33-50 amino acids have been deleted, as described above. Following expression of the protein in the host cells, the inclusion bodies were easily isolated from the host cells by centrifugation.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2: Cloning of fusion proteins larger than 10 kD\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to make fusion protein with truncated thioredoxin, a vector containing a unique \nAva\nI site, used to make concatamers, was developed; this vector was designated pTrxA-concat (\nFigure 4\n; SEQ ID NO:8). Using this vector, a series of fusion proteins has been made linking the vector to single or multiple fragments of thioredoxin (\nFigure 5\n; SEQ ID NO:11) (thioredoxin-thioredoxin fusion), \nE. coli\n DEAD-box protein (\nFigure 6\n; SEQ ID NO:14), \nKpn\nI methylase (\nFigure 7\n; SEQ ID NO:17), or 264-bp modified T4 gene 32 protein (\nFigure 1\n; SEQ ID NO:1) (\nSee\n \n \nU.S. Patent 5,449,758\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, fusion proteins of the indicated molecular weights were made by ligating pTrxA-concat to one or more copies of the nucleic acid molecules encoding 10 kD fragments of truncated \nE. coli\n thioredoxin (Δ\ntrx\nA) or T4 gene 32 protein, or 5 kD fragments of \nE. coli\n Dead-Box protein or \nKpn\nI methylase, as shown in Table 1. In all cases, the fusion protein was expressed as inclusion bodies. Thus, using the methods of the present invention, polypeptides ranging in size from 10 kD to 220 kD, in 5-10 kD increments, have been efficiently produced as inclusion bodies.\n\n \n \n \nTable 1\n.

Purified proteins of differing sizes, made as described in Example 2, were mixed and separated by SDS-PAGE, and the banding patterns in various acrylamide concentrations was observed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of these experiments showed the combination of proteins, allowing the best resolution over a range of acrylamide concentrations to be a mixture of 10 kD, 15 kD, 20 kD, 25 kD, 30 kD, 40 kD, 50 kD, 60 kD, 70 kD, 80 kD, 90 kD, 100 kD, 120 kD, 160 kD and 220 kD proteins. These results demonstrate that the methods of the present invention are useful in making proteins of various size ranges, and may be used to produce compositions comprising protein molecular weight ladders.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 4: Production of Prestained Protein Molecular Weight Ladders\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPrestained protein molecular weight ladders have been commercially available for more than 10 years in two distinct forms. In one form, all of the proteins are stained with a single dye, and in the second form each protein is stained with different dyes (a multicolored version) These two distinct forms have several advantages and disadvantages. Single color markers, for example, are typically prepared in a way that results in relatively sharp bands in SDS-PAGE compared to multicolored markers, but directly relating each band to its corresponding molecular weight can be difficult since the only point of reference in single colored prestained markers is the highest or lowest molecular weight band. If either of these reference bands disappears during storage, or is not resolved on the gel, the absence of a point of reference makes identification of the remaining bands difficult. Similarly, determination of the identity of the bands in multicolored markers is easy since each band is a distinct color, but some of then bands are very broad in SDS-PAGE and some of the colors are difficult to detect visually\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present invention, a new set of prestained protein molecular weight markers has been developed. These markers are evenly spaced on SDS-PAGE and comprise a reference band of a different color from the other bands to allow easy orientation of all of the marker bands. A single dye was used to stain all but one protein (the reference protein), which was stained with a second dye. Staining protocols were developed to produce prestained proteins that gave sharp bands on SDS-PAGE using both dyes, in contrast to the wide variations in band sharpness common in multicolored markers. The protein stained with the second dye serves as a point of reference within the marker facilitating the identification of the prestained marker bands. A number of dyes were tested including Remasol brilliant blue R (RBBR), eosin isothiocyanate, procion red, reactive orange (also known as procion yellow), eosin iodoacetamide, reactive black 5, Remasol brilliant violet 5R, \nreactive orange\n 14, rhodamine isothiocyanate, and malachite green isothiocyanate. Labeling and storage conditions of each protein component was optimized in terms of buffer pH and ionic composition, dye concentration, protein concentration, temperature of labeling, and incubation time during labeling, as described in detail above in the Materials and Methods section.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of different cloned proteins were labeled with RBBR and then run on SDS-PAGE to determine the effectiveness of the labeling procedure and to determine the apparent molecular weights of the labeled proteins. As shown in \nFigure 8\n, the most intense staining and most even spacing on SDS-PAGE were achieved with the combination of 10,15,20, 30, 40, 50, 70, 100, and 160 kDa proteins. The 50 kDa protein was labeled with eosin isothiocyanate so that a highlight or reference band could be incorporated into the marker ladder. This bright pink band was positioned as the fourth band from the top and the sixth band from the bottom (not including the aprotinin standard which is not part of the ladder composition), providing an easy point of reference to determine the molecular weight of a particular band. These results demonstrate that the present methods may be used to produce molecular weight marker sets that are easily prestained.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 5: Production of Molecular Weight Markers for use in Blotting\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIt would be useful to have molecular weight markers that can not only be used to determine molecular weight after coomassie blue staining in a gel, but that also could be used as molecular weight markers following membrane transfer techniques such as western blotting. The molecular weight markers produced by the present methods can be used for both of these applications. As described above, each af the protein components in the unstained molecular weight marker mixture contains six histidine residues at the carboxy terminus. Since these six histidine residues interact with Ni\n++\n (\nHochuli, E., and Piesecki, S., Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology 4:68-72 (1992\n), a Ni-NTA-alkabne phosphatase conjugate along with nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (NBT)/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate p-toluidine salt (BCIP) can be used to detect and identify the protein components in a Western Blot.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 6: Production of Small or Toxic Proteins\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present system is particularly useful to express proteins that are difficult to express in \nE. coli\n, whether this difficulty is due to (1) smaller size of the protein (in general, smaller proteins are expressed at lower levers in \nE. coli\n); (2) toxicity of the heterologous protein to the \nE. coli\n host; (3) inefficient translation in \nE. coli\n; or (4) instability of the mRNA. As shown in the examples above, the present methods allow efficient production of heterologous proteins as inclusion bodies. Since inclusion bodies are an isolated form of the expressed protein, this system may be used to produce toxic proteins or small peptides which otherwise might not be produced in \nE. coli\n or other bacterial host cells. Using this system, peptides of 5kD and smaller have been produced. The system can also be used to produce polypeptides 250 kD in size or larger.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 7: Optimization of Conditions for Labeling Protein Ladders With Remasol Brilliant Blue R (RBER)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn general, chemical modification or conjugation of a protein (\ne\n.\ng\n., labeling it with a dye) involves the reaction of functionally reactive groups on the protein with corresponding functionally reactive groups on the label. Reactive groups able to couple with amine-containing molecules, such as proteins containing lysine residues, are by far the most common functional groups present on cross-linking reagents such as dyes. An amine-coupling process therefore can be used to conjugate nearly all proteins or peptides with other molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present invention, a variety of dyes, including remazol brilliant blue R (RBBR) and eosin isothiocyanate, have been used as coupling reagents for labeling of molecular weight ladder proteins. These dyes primarily react with nucleophilic amine groups on the proteins to yield stable protein-dye complexes. The dyes can also react, to some extent, with other nucleophiles on the target proteins, such as sulfhydryl groups and phenolate ions of tyrosine side chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo produce the most useful (\ni\n.\ne\n., highest color intensity and band sharpness) and consistent (\ni\n.\ne\n., lowest variability in band mobility between batches) prestained protein ladders, it is essential to optimize the staining protocol. The band intensity will depend upon the amount of primary amine groups present in the protein being conjugated with the dye, while the band sharpness will depend upon how many af the available primary amines in the target protein have been conjugated with the dye. Each of these variables will be dependent upon the environmental conditions to which the protein and dye are subjected during conjugation. Thus, the extent of conjugation of the target marker proteins with dye will depend upon a number of conditions during staining, including concentrations of the protein and dye in solution, pH of the solution, ionic conditions, temperature, and duration of incubation of protein with the dye.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, one object of the present invention is to develop conditions to stain protein molecular weight markers that will provide molecular weight ladders with bands that resolve as intensely, as homogeneously, and as consistently as possible. To meet this objective, the labeling conditions in terms of concentrations of the protein and dye in solution, pH of the solution (adjusted prior to addition of protein(s) and dye(s)), and temperature and time of incubation, were optimized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo minimize volumes in which the reactions were carried out, varied concentrations of proteins were examined. Proteins produced as described above were prepared in solutions at 1,2, and 4 A\n280\n units/m!, and labeled with RBBR as generally described above in the Materials and Methods section, and then separated on 4-20% SDS-PAGE gradient gels as above in Example 4. Intensity of staining was then determined by densitometry and by eyesight. In general, protein concentrations of 1 and 2 A\n280\n units/ml produced signals of similar intensity, while labeling intensity was lower at 4 A\n280\n units/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn analogous experiments, the optimal concentration of RBBR was determined by staining proteins with RBBR at a range of concentrations from 0.3 to 30 mg/ml. In general, 10 mg/ml RBBR was found to provide the most intensely staining, homogeneous product when proteins of 40 kD and 100 kD were labeled, while proteins of 10 kD, 15 kD, 20 kD, 30 kD, 45 kD, 50 kD, 60 kD, 70 kD, and 160 kD, were optimally labeled by 30 mg/ml of RBBR. These results suggest that a range of about 5-50 mg/ml, or 10-30 mg/ml, of RBBR may be optimal for labeling of protein molecular weight ladders consisting of proteins of varying molecular weights.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preliminary experiments designed to determine optimal temperature and time periods for labeling, incubation of the proteins in solution without dye indicated that the proteins tended to degrade when incubated at 70°C for 0.5-1 hour, and when incubated at 60°C for about 2-5 hours. When incubated overnight (12-24 hours) at about 50°C or lower, however, the proteins appeared to be stable (\ni\n.\ne\n., to resist degradation in solution). Upon staining the protein solutions with RBBR at the above-noted concentration ranges, the most homogeneous and intense bands (\ni\n.\ne\n., sharpest and brightest banding patterns) were observed in protein preparations stained with RBBR overnight at 50°C. Shorter incubation periods (\ne\n.\ng\n., 4 to 8 hours) produced more heterogeneous (\ni\n.\ne\n., more diffuse and less intense) banding patterns, particularly with lower molecular weight proteins (10 kD to 60 kD). Overnight incubations at room temperature (about 20°C to 25°C) and at 37°C did not produce satisfactory results; protein ladder preparations stained with RBBR under these conditions resulted in ladders demonstrating even more diffuse and less intense banding patterns These results indicate that overnight staining of proteins at 50°C is optimal for producing protein molecular weight ladders prestained with RBBR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, to determine pH optima for staining of the ladder preparations with RBBR, proteins were labeled with RBBR as above in solutions buffered to pHs ranging from about 72 to about 9.7. Ideal results (\ni\n.\ne\n., most intensely staining and least diffuse banding patterns) were observed in solutions buffered to pH 9.2. It is to be noted, however, that the pH of the final staining mixture was about 8.3 (after addition of protein and dye), while the optimal initial pH of the buffer to which protein and dye were added was about 9.2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together, these results suggest that the optimal conditions for producing protein molecular weight ladders prestained with RBBR include a protein concentration of about 1 to 2 A\n280\n units/ml, a dye concentration of about 5 to about 50 mg/ml, a pH of about 9.0 to 9.5, and incubation of the protein and dye for about 12-24 hours at a temperature of about 50°C.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 8: Optimization of Conditions for Labeling Protein Ladders With Eosin Isothiocyanate\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs noted in Example 4 above, eosin labeling of a single protein band in a complex protein molecular weight ladder, particularly between the RBBR-labeled 40 kD and 70 kD bands, provides a valuable reference band that permits rapid and accurate identification of all of the other protein bands in the ladder. Therefore, the optimal conditions for labeling 30 kD, 40 kD, 50 kD and 60 kD proteins with eosin isothiocyanate, for use in the ladders of the invention, were determined\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious preparations of 30 kD, 40 kD, 50 kD and 60 kD recombinant proteins, prepared as described above in Examples 1 and 2, were incubated with eosin isothiocyanate under the conditions of protein concentration, dye concentration, temperature, time, and pH, used for the studies with RBBR in Example 7 Following labeling with eosin isothiocyanate, protein preparations were run on 4-20% SDS-PAGE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFigures 9-12\n, the pH and temperature conditions used during eosin labeling of 30 kD, 40 kD, 50 kD and 60 kD reference proteins dramatically affected the intensity of staining and sharpness of resolution of the bands on SDS-PAGE. Optimal results were obtained when about 2 A\n280\n units of the 50 kD protein were incubated overnight (ideally for about 4-16 hours) at 50°C with a final concentration of eosin isothiocyanate of about 7 mg/ml at pH 9.2 (see \nFigure 9\n, \nlane\n 5; \nFigure 10\n, \nlane\n 13; \nFigure 11\n, \nlane\n 14; and \nFigure 12\n, lane 8), and when the 60 kD protein was labeled under the same conditions, except at pH 9.2-9.7 (see \nFigure 9\n, \nlane\n 13, and \nFigure 12\n, lane 6). Under these same conditions, however, incubation of the proteins with the commonly used dye procion red produced little or no staining of the ladder bands (see \nFigure 12\n, lanes 1-4).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 9: Optimization of Conditions for Labeling Protein Ladders With Malachite Green Isothiocyanate\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo provide reference bands and proteins ladders stained with a variety of colors, it would be advantageous to stain the protein ladders of the invention with a dye, such as malachite green, of different color from RBBR and eosin, Therefore, the optimal conditions for labeling 30 kD, 40 kD, 50 kD and 60 kD proteins with malachite green isothiocyanate were determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious preparations of 30 kD, 40 kD, 50 kD and 60 kD recombinant proteins, prepared as described above in Examples 1 and 2, were incubated with malachite green isothiocyanate under the conditions of protein concentration, dye concentration, temperature, time, and pH, used for the studies with RBBR in Example 7 and with eosin isothiocyanate in Example 8. Following labeling with malachite green isothiocyanate, protein preparations were run on 4-20% SDS-PAGE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFigure 13\n, the pH conditions used during malachite green labeling of 40 kD, 50 kD and 60 kD reference proteins dramatically affected the intensity of staining and sharpness of resolution of the bands on SDS-PAGE Optimal results were obtained when about 1-2 A\n280\n units of the proteins were incubated overnight (ideally for about 16 hours) at room temperature with a final concentration of malachite green isothiocyanate of about 20-30 mg/ml at pH 9.2 (see \nFigure 13\n, \n \n \nlanes\n \n \n 2, 4, 6 and 8).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHaving now fully described the present invention in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that the same can be performed by modifying or changing the invention within a wide and equivalent range of conditions, formulations and other parameters without affecting the scope of the invention or any specific embodiment thereof, and that such modifications or changes are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the appended claims.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll publications, patents and patent applications mentioned in this specification are indicative of the level of skill of those skilled in the art to which this invention pertains, and are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject matter of the following paragraphs also form part of the present invention:\n\n \n \n \n1.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Field of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a method for using a compound to inhibit the growth of cancer cells, in particular to compounds isolated and purified from the mycelium of \nMyrothecium\n sp. which can be applied in inhibiting the growth of lung cancer cells, hepatic cancer cells and prostate cancer cells.\n\n\n \n\n\n2. The Prior Arts\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCancer has become the number one killer disease after the 20th century. According to statistics made by the department of Health in Taiwan in June 2002, malignant cancer has been the first leading cause on top 10 causes of death for the last 20 years since 1982, with a mortality rate of 147.68 per 100,000 populations, and approximately 33,000 deaths in 2001. Searches for effective anti-cancer compounds with mild side effects therefore become imperative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTrichothecenes belong to the family of sesquiterpenoids with broad physiological activities, which are produced by several fungi including \nFusarium, Trichothecium, Trichoderma, Myrothecium, Cephalosporium, Stachybotrys,\n and \nCylindrocarpon.\n Studies have shown that trichothecenes exert anti-bacterial activity, and have cytostatic activity \nin vitro.\n Trichothecenes can be divided into two groups including macrocyclic and non-macrocyclic compounds based on the differences in chemical structure. Mycotoxins containing macrocyclic trichothecenes such as verrucarins, roridins, satratoxin, vertisporin, and baccharinoid are famous and reported to have a variety of biological activities. They inhibit initiation of protein translation further interfere with protein synthesis by binding with polysomes and 80S ribosomes in eukaryotic cells. Most of these mycotoxins have been applied in antibiotics to inhibit bacterial growth, in antiflammation and in immunomodulatory. Verrucarins, also known as muconomycin and produced by \nMyrothecium\n sp., can be categorized into verrucarin A (muconomycin A), verrucarin J (muconomycin J), verrucarin K and the like according to their chemical structures. Verrucarins have been shown to exert prolonged inhibition of protein and glycoprotein synthesis and have immuno-suppressive activity. Antiviral activities against Newcastle virus and tobacco mosaic virus of verrucarins were also reported.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of lung cancer, hepatic cancer and prostate cancer were not studied in the abovementioned applications of verrucarins. Therefore, the application of verrucarins in cancers can be great benefits to the therapies of lung cancer, hepatic cancer and prostate cancer in human.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to identify the anti-tumor compounds, the invention relates to compounds with the following structural formula isolating and purifing from the extracts of \nMyrothecium\n sp..\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of formula (1) is verrucarin A (muconomycin B), with a molecular formula of C\n27\nH\n32\nO\n8\n, and a molecular weight of 484.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of formula (2) is verrucarin J (muconomycin B), with a molecular formula of C\n27\nH\n34\nO\n9\n, and a molecular weight of 502.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (1) and formula (2) in the present invention are purified from organic solvent extracts of \nMyrothecium\n sp. The organic solvents used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or propanol, with ethanol being preferred. Any other suitable organic liquids which can extract compounds of formula (1) or formula (2) including esters such as ethyl acetate, alkanes such as hexane, or haloalkanes such as chloromethane, chloroethane can be applied.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a method for using abovementioned compounds of formula (1) and formula (2) to inhibit tumor cell growth. More specifically, the method comprises administrating an effective dose of the compounds to inhibit a range of cancer cells including lung cancer, hepatic cancer and prostate cancer, which result in slowering the growth of cancer cells, further inhibiting proliferation of cancer cells and decreasing the risk of malignancy. Therefore the method for using the compound of the present invention can be applied in the treatment of lung cancer, hepatic cancer, prostate cancer and more.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides a method of using a pharmaceutical composition containing an effective dose of the compounds of structural formula (1) and structural formula (2) for treating lung cancer, hepatic cancer and prostate cancer to enhance the therapeutic effects against cancer cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (1) and/or formula (2) in the invention can be incorporated into the pharmaceutical compositions for treating lung cancer, hepatic cancer, and prostate cancer to inhibit the growth of tumor cells. The pharmaceutical compositions include not only the compounds of formula (1) and/or formula (2), but also the pharmaceutically accepted carriers. The carriers include, but are not limited to, excipients such as water, fillers such as sucrose or starch, binders such as cellulose derivatives, diluents, disintegrants, absorption enhancers or sweeteners. The inventive composition can be manufactured through mixing the compounds of formula (1) and/or formula (2) with at least one of the carriers by means of conventional methods known in the pharmaceutically technical field, which can be formulated, but are not limited to, as a powder, tablet, capsule, pellets, granules or other liquid formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is further explained in the following embodiment illustration and examples. Those examples below should not, however, be considered to limit the scope of the invention, it is contemplated that modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art, which modifications will be within the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe mycelia of \nMyrothecium\n sp. were cultivated and harvested. The mycelia were then extracted with organic solvents to obtain the organic solvent extracts of \nMyrothecium\n sp by the well known extraction methods in the art. The organic solvents include, but not limited to, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or propanol, esters such as ethyl acetate, alkanes such as hexane, or haloalkanes such as chloromethane, chloroethane. Among them, alcohol is preferred, and 95% ethanol is particularly preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe organic solvent extracts of \nMyrothecium\n sp. were subjected to preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for isolation and purification. Each fraction was recovered and assayed for biological activities. The potent fractions with anti-cancer effects were analyzed for the composition and further assayed against different tumor cells. The above approach then led to the identification of compounds of the formula (1) and formula (2), which inhibited the growth of tumor cells of lung cancer, hepatic cancer, and prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (1) and formula (2) were demonstrated with anti-cancer effects using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay according to the anti-tumor agents screening model of National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the United States National Institutes of Health on cell survival rates using cell lines of lung cancer, hepatic cancer, prostate cancer and the like. The above assays had proved that verrucarin A and verrucarin J decreased survival rates of lung cancer cell lines (A-549), hepatic carcinoma cell lines (Hep 3B and Hep G2) and prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and DU-145), at the same time showed relatively low maximal inhibitory concentration (IC\n50\n) values. Therefore verrucarin A and verrucarin J can be used in inhibiting cancer cell growth of lung cancer, hepatic cancer, and prostate cancer, which can further be applied in cancer treatment of lung cancer, hepatic cancer, prostate cancer and the like. The details of the examples are described as follows:\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCultivation of \nMyrothecium\n sp.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMedia for \nMyrothecium\n sp. were prepared as described below. The media contained 0.1-2 g of NaCl, 5-10g of peptone, 1-2 g of yeast extract, 3-10 g of agar, 3-10 g of cereal (chosen from rice, wheat, glutinous rice or corn and the like), 1-2 g of nitrogen source (NH\n4\nNO\n3\n or KNO\n3\n), 1-3 g of carbon source (glucose, fructose or sucrose), some phosphate salt, trace amount of metal ions (magnesium, or calcium) in 800-1000 ml of double distilled water. Final pH was adjusted to 6.5-7.5 with 1 N NaOH or 1 N HCl. Media were autoclaved at 120°C for 20 min in a conical flask with cotton plugging. \nMyrothecium verrucaria\n or \nMyrothecium rodium tode\n was inoculated into the cooled media in a laminar flow hood and incubated at 20-30°C for 4-8 weeks to gain the mycelia of \nMyrothecium\n sp.. \nMyrothecium\n sp. were collected from soil under trees in hill side of Snow Mountain, Taiwan and identified by Professor Tseng, Hsien-hsiung of National Taiwan University. Microbial sources of interest also include, but are not limited to the abovementioned strains, any alternative strains used to provide verrucarin A and veccucarin J.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsolation of compounds with anti-cancer activities\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOne hundred grams of mycelia of \nMyrothecium sp.\n from Example 1 were placed into a flask. A proper amount of 95% alcohol was added into the flask and stirred at 20-25°C for at least 1 hour. The solution was filtered through a filter with 0.45 µm membrane and the filtrate was collected as the extract. The organic solvents used include, but are not limited to, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or propanol, with ethanol being preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe filtrate of \nMyrothecium\n sp. was subjected to High Performance Liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis with a silica gel column. The mobile phase consisted of hexane and ethyl acetate (EA). The column effluent was monitored with a UV-visible detector. Ten fractions were collected and assayed for their biological activities. Compositions of fractions containing biological activities were analyzed. Separation with different ratios of hexane and acetone on these fractions yielded compounds of formula (1) and formula (2). Compound of formula (1) is verrucarin A after analysis, which showed a molecular formula of C\n27\nH\n32\nO\n8\n, a molecular weight of 484. Compound of formula (2) is verrucarin J after analysis, which showed a molecular formula of C\n27\nH\n34\nO\n9\n, a molecular weight of 502.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn vitro\n assay of anti-tumor activity of hepatic cancer\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe NCI anti-cancer agents screen model was employed to test the anti-cancer effect of the verrucarin A and verrucarin J in the invention. The verrucarin A and verrucarin J isolated from example 2 were added into the culture media of human hepatic cancer cells, Hep 3B or Hep G2, for determining tumor cell survival by MTT assay. MTT assay was known to assess the survival rates of cell. Hepatic cancer cells Hep 3B (under an accession number of BCRC 60434) and Hep G2 (under an accession number of BCRC 60025), were obtained from the Bioresources Collection and Research Center (BCRC) of the Food Industry Research and Development Institute.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMTT assay is commonly used to analyze cell proliferation, percentage of viable cells, and cytotoxicity. MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) is a yellow dye, which can be absorbed by the living cells and be reduced to violet insoluble formazan products by succinate tetrazolium reductase in mitochondria. Formation of formazan products in viable cells can therefore be used to assess and determine the survival rate of cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe human hepatic cancer cells, Hep 3B and Hep G2, were cultured in media containing fetal bovine serum for 24 hours. The proliferated cells were washed once with PBS, then treated with 1x trypsin-EDTA and centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of fresh culture medium by gently shaking. The cells were placed in a 96-well plate. Both crude extracts of \nMyrothecium\n sp. (the control group, total ethanol extracts of \nMyrothecium\n sp. without HPLC purification), or verrucarin A and verrucarin J (the experimental group) were added into each of the wells at the following concentrations: 100, 30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1 and 0.03 ng/ml, respectively. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO\n2\n incubator for 48 hours. MTT dye was added in a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml into each well in dark and incubated for 4 hours, followed by the addition of 100 µl of lysis buffer to stop the reaction. Subsequently, absorption was measured on an enzyme immunoassay analyzer at 570 nm for the measurement of viable cell number and determine the survival rates. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC\n50\n) values of the control group and the experimental group were also calculated and listed in Table 1.\n\n \nTable 1 The result of \nin vitro\n survival assay for anti-tumor activity of hepatic cancer cells\n \n \n \n \nSamples\n \n \nIC\n50\n(ng/ml)\n \n \n \nHep3B\n \nHepG2\n \n \n \n \nControl group\n \ncrude extracts of \nMyrothecium sp.\n \n \n23.81\n \n45.89\n \n \n \nExperimental\n \nverrucarin A\n \n2.31\n \n10.21\n \n \n \ngroup\n \nverrucarin J\n \n3.12\n \n13.31\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the result of table 1, verrucarin A and verrucarin J can effectively decrease the survival rates of human hepatic cancer cell line Hep 3B and Hep G2. The IC\n50\n values of verrucarin A and verrucarin J toward Hep 3B were 2.31 ng/ml and 3.12 ng/ml respectively, which were 90.3% and 86.9% lower than the IC\n50\n values 23.81 ng/ml of crude extracts from \nMyrothecium\n sp.. The IC\n50\n values of verrucarin A and verrucarin J toward Hep G2 were 10.21 ng/ml and 13.31 ng/ml respectively, which were 77.75% and 71% lower than that of crude extracts from \nMyrothecium\n sp. In addition, hepatic cancer cells treated with verrucarin A showed lower IC\n50\n values than cells treated with verrucarin J, that is, lower concentration of verrucarin A was needed in inhibiting growth of half of the cancer cells. Verrucarin A has better inhibiting effect than verrucarin J on the growth of hepatic cancer cells.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn vitro\n survival assay for anti-tumor activity of lung cancer\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe NCI anti-cancer angents screen model was also employed to test the anti-lung cancer effect of the verrucarin A and verrucarin J in the invention. Verrucarin A and verrucarin J isolated from example 2 were added into the culture media of human lung cancer cell A549 for tumor cell survival assay, and lung cancer cell survival rates were analyzed with the abovementioned MTT assay. Lung cancer cell A549 was obtained from the Bioresources Collection and Research Center (BCRC) of the Food Industry Research and Development Institute with an accession number of BCRC 60074.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe human lung cancer cell A549 was cultured in media containing fetal bovine serum for 24 hours. The proliferated cells were washed once with PBS, then treated with 1x trypsin-EDTA and centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of fresh culture medium by gently shaking. The cells were placed in a 96-well plate. Both crude extracts of \nMyrothecium\n sp. (the control group, total ethanol extracts of \nMyrothecium\n sp. without HPLC purification), or verrucarin A and verrucarin J (the experimental group) were added into each of the wells at the following concentrations: 100, 30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3, and 0.1 ng/ml, respectively. The cells were incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO\n2\n incubator for 48 hours. MTT dye was added in a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml into each well in dark and incubated for 4 hours, followed by the addition of 100 µl of lysis buffer to stop the reaction. The plates were read on an ELISA reader at wavelength of 570 nm to determine the survival rates. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC\n50\n) values were also calculated and listed in Table 2.\n\n \nTable 2 The result of \nin vitro\n survival assay for anti-tumor activity of lung cancer cells\n \n \n \n \nSamples\n \n \nIC\n50\n(ng/ml)\n \n \n \nA549\n \n \n \n \nControl group\n \ncrude extracts of \nMyrothecium\n sp.\n \n52\n \n \n \nExperimental\n \nverrucarin A\n \n1.12\n \n \n \ngroup\n \nverrucarin J\n \n2.34\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the result of table 2, verrucarin A and verrucarin J can effectively decrease the survival rates of human lung cancer cell line A549. The IC\n50\n values of verrucarin A and verrucarin J toward Hep 3B were 1.12 ng/ml and 2.34 ng/ml respectively, which were 97.85% and 95.5% lower than that of crude extracts from \nMyrothecium\n sp. (52 ng/ml). Both verrucarin A and verrucarin J showed remarkably reduced IC\n50\n values than the control group. Therefore, verrucarin A and verrucarin J can be applied in inhibiting the growth of lung cancer cells. In addition, lung cancer cells treated with verrucarin A showed lower IC\n50\n values than cells treated with verrucarin J, that is, lower concentration of verrucarin A was needed in inhibiting the growth of half of lung cancer cells. This represents that verrucarin A has better inhibiting effect than verrucarin J on the growth of lung cancer cells.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn vitro\n survival assay for anti-tumor activity of prostate cancer\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAccording to anti-tumor agents screening model of NCI of the United States National Institutes of Health, the abovementioned MTT assay is processed by adding Verrucarin A and verrucarin J into the culture medium of human prostate cancer tumor cells LNCaP and DU-145, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProstate cancer is a cancer originated from epithelial cells of prostate gland, which depends on androgen in the early stage. Initially all prostate cancer cells are androgen-dependent, which can be treated with androgen-deprivation therapy. LNCaP represents this type of prostate cancer at an early stage. However, 30% of the patients will experience recurrence, and the secreting amounts of androgen become very low. Finally, recurrent cancer progresses to the androgen-independent prostate cancer, which has no effective treatment so far. DU-145 represents this type of cancer cells. Both LNCaP and DU-145 were ordered from the Bioresources Collection and Research Center (BCRC) of the Food Industry Research and Development Institute with accession numbers of CCRC 60088 and CCRC 60348 respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe human hepatic cancer cells, LNCaP and DU-145, were cultured in media supplemented with fetal bovine serum for 24 hours. The proliferated cells were washed once with PBS, then treated with 1x trypsin-EDTA and centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of fresh culture medium by gently shaking. The cells were placed in a 96-well plate. Water (negative control group), 4.2 ng/ml of taxol (positive control), 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01 ng/ml of crude extracts of \nMyrothecium\n sp. (experimental control group, crude extracts of \nMyrothecium\n sp. without HPLC purification) or 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 ng/ml of verrucarin A and verrucarin J (experimental group) were added into each of the 96 wells respectively. The cells were incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO\n2\n incubator for 48 hours. MTT dye was added in a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml into each well in dark and incubated for 4 hours, followed by the addition of 100 µl of lysis buffer to stop the reaction. The plates were read on an ELISA reader at wavelength of 570 nm to determine the survival rates (%). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC\n50\n) values were also calculated and listed in Table 3 and Table 4.\n\n \nTable 3 The result of \nin vitro\n survival assay for anti-tumor activity of prostate cancer cells\n \n \n \n \nSamples\n \n \nIC\n50\n(ng/ml)\n \n \n \nLNCaP\n \nDU-145\n \n \n \n \nExperimental control group\n \ncrude extracts of \nMyrothecium\n sp.\n \n29.31\n \n33.16\n \n \n \nExperimental group\n \nverrucarin A\n \n2.85\n \n0.02\n \n \n \nverrucarin J\n \n0.31\n \n0.28\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the result of table 3, the cell survival rates of LNCaP and DU-145 were effectively reduced through the functions of verrucarin A and verrucarin J. The IC\n50\n values of verrucarin A and verrucarin J toward LNCaP were 2.85 ng/ml and 0.31 ng/ml respectively, which were 90.28% and 98.94% relatively lower than the IC\n50\n value of experimental control group (29.31 ng/ml). The IC\n50\n values of verrucarin A and verrucarin J toward DU-145 were 0.02 ng/ml and 0.28 ng/ml respectively, which were 99.93% and 99.16% relatively lower than the IC\n50\n value of experimental control group (33.16 ng/ml). Therefore verrucarin A and verrucarin J from \nMyrothecium sp.\n can be applied to inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells, which showed much lower IC\n50\n values than the crude extracts (29.31 ng/ml and 33.16 ng/ml). In addition, LNCaP prostate cancer cells treated with verrucarin J showed lower IC50 values than verrucarin A treated cells, that is, verrucarin J has better inhibiting effect than verrucarin A on the growth of LNCaP prostate cancer cells. While DU-145 prostate cancer cells treated with verrucarin A showed lower IC50 values than verrucarin J treated cells, that is, verrucarin A has better inhibiting effect than verrucarin J on the growth of DU-145 prostate cancer cells.\n\n \nTable 4 Effects of verrucarin A and verrucarin J on the growth of DU-145 prostate cancer cell\n \n \n \nsamples\n \nconcentration (ng/ml)\n \nCell survival rate (%)\n \n \n \n \nNegative control group\n \nwater\n \n \n \n100\n \n \n \nPositive control\n \nTaxol\n \n4.2\n \n63.88\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n100\n \n20.60\n \n \n \nExperimental\n \ncrude extracts of\n \n10\n \n91.01\n \n \n \ncontrol group\n \n \nMyrothecium\n sp.\n \n1\n \n94.30\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0.1\n \n101.31\n \n \n \nExperimental group\n \n \n \n100\n \n16.96\n \n \n \n \n \n10\n \n17.07\n \n \n \nverrucarin A\n \n1\n \n16.99\n \n \n \n \n \n0.1\n \n21.01\n \n \n \n \n \n0.01\n \n72.31\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0.001\n \n94.33\n \n \n \n \n \n100\n \n20.36\n \n \n \n \n \n10\n \n18.95\n \n \n \nverrucarin J\n \n1\n \n19.93\n \n \n \n \n \n0.1\n \n81.11\n \n \n \n \n \n0.01\n \n101.30\n \n \n \n \n \n0.001\n \n100.21\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, Table 4 shows the growth of DU-145 prostate cancer cell was effectively reduced through the function of verrucarin A and verrucarin J. In comparison to the control groups, the cancer cell survival rates were reduced to 20% when verrucarin A and verrucarin J were employed in the concentration of 1 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml. The cell survival rates reduced in accordance with the addition of concentration of crude extracts of \nMyrothecium\n sp., or verrucarin A and verrucarin J. On the contrary, the cell survival rates increased when the employment concentration reduced. When the concentration of control and experimental group reduced to 10 ng/ml, the cell survival rate increased to 91.01% with the addition of crude extracts of \nMyrothecium\n sp., while the cell survival rates stayed around 19% with the addition of purified verrucarin A or verrucarin J respectively. Verrucarin A and verrucarin J were shown to be the active ingredients for inhibition of DU-145 prostate cancer cells. In addition, the cell survival rate was 63.88% when treating with 4.2 ng/ml Taxol, while the cell survival rates reduced remarkably lower to 20% when employment concentration of verrucarin A and verrucarin J were ranged from 1 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml. This demonstrated a superior inhibition effect in human prostate cancer cell of verrucarin A and verrucarin J compared to Taxol. And significant cancer inhibiting effects were observed even when the employment concentration reached to as low as 0.1 ng/ml and 1 ng/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, the cell survival rates were similar when employment concentration of verrucarin A and verrucarin J were above 1 ng/ml (ranged from 1 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml). That is, both of them showed similar anti-cancer effects within these concentration ranges. However, verrucarin A has better effect than verrucarin J in inhibition on the growth of DU-145 prostate cancer cells when the employment concentration was lowered than 0.1 ng/ml (ranged from 0.001 ng/ml to 0.1 ng/ml).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, verrucarin A and verrucarin J purified from extracts of \nMyrothecium\n sp. can effectively inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells LNCaP and DU-145 with different characteristics. Therefore, both verrucarin A and verrucarin J can not only be applied in inhibiting the growth of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell LNCaP, but also can be applied in inhibiting the growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer cell DU-145. This will be beneficial to the therapy of prostate cancer and recurrent prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, verrucarin A and verrucarin J can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions. The pharmaceutical compositions include not only the active compound verrucarin A and verrucarin J, but also the pharmaceutically accepted carriers. Examples of such carriers include, but are not limited to, excipients such as water, fillers such as sucrose or starch, binders such as cellulose derivatives, diluents, disintegrants, absorption enhancers or sweeteners. The inventive composition can be manufactured through mixing the compound of verrucarin A and verrucarin J from \nMyrothecium\n sp. with at least one of the carriers by means of conventional methods known in the pharmaceutically technical field, which can be formulated in the forms of powder, tablets, capsules, pellets, granules or other liquid formulation, but are not limited to. The purpose in the present invention for treatment of tumor and inhibiting the growth of cancer cells can then be accomplished."

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDNA-topoisomerases are enzymes which are present in the nuclei of cells where they catalyze the breaking and rejoining of DNA strands, which control the topological state of DNA. Recent studies also suggest that topoisomerases are also involved in regulating template supercoiling during RNA transcription. There are two major classes of mammalian topoisomerases. DNA-topoisomerase-I catalyzes changes in the topological state of duplex DNA by performing transient single-strand breakage-union cycles. In contrast, mammalian topoisomerase II alters the topology of DNA by causing a transient enzyme bridged double-strand break, followed by strand passing and resealing. Mammalian topoisomerase II has been further classified as Type II α and Type II β. The antitumor activity associated with agents which are topoisomerase poisons is associated with their ability to stabilize the enzyme-DNA cleavable complex. This drug-induced stabilization of the enzyme-DNA cleavable complex effectively converts the enzyme into a cellular poison.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral antitumor agents in clinical use have potent activity as mammalian topoisomerase II poisons. These include adriamycin, actinomycin D, daunomycin, VP-16, and VM-26 (teniposide or epipodophyllotoxin). In contrast to the number of clinical and experimental drugs which act as topoisomerase II poisons, there are currently only a limited number of agents which have been identified as topoisomerase I poisons. Camptothecin and its structurally-related analogs are among the most extensively studied topoisomerase I poisons. Recently, bi- and terbenzimidazoles (\nChen et al., Cancer Res. 1993, 53, 1332-1335\n; \nSun et al., J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 363 8-3644\n; \nKim et al., J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 992-998\n), certain benzo[c]phenanthridine and protoberberine alkaloids and their synthetic analogs (\nMaldley et al., Med. Chem. Res. 1995, 5, 1-12\n; \nJanin et al., J. Med. Chem. 1975, 18, 708-713\n; \nMakhey et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. 1996, 4, 781-791\n), as well as the fungal metabolites, bulgarein (\nFujii et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1993, 268, 13160-13165\n) and saintopin (\nYamashita et al., Biochemistry 1991, 30, 5838-5845\n) and indolocarbazoles (\nYamashita et al., Biochemistry 1992, 31, 12069-12075\n) have been identified as topoisomerase I poisons. Other topoisomerase poisons have been identified including certain benzo[i]phenanthridine and cinnoline compounds (see \n \nLaVoie et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,140,328\n \n (735.037WO1), and \n \nWO 01/32631\n \n(735.044WO1)). While these compounds are useful they are somewhat limited due to low solubility.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nApplicant has discovered compounds with improved solubility properties which also have inhibitory activity against topoisomerase I and/or topoisomerase II.

It may be desirable to optionally use a protecting group during all or portions of the above described synthetic procedures. Such protecting groups and methods for their introduction and removal are well known in the art. See \nGreene, T.W.; Wutz, P.G.M. \"\nProtecting Groups In Organic Synthesis\n\" second edition, 1991, New York, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that compounds of the invention having a chiral center may exist in and be isolated in optically active and racemic forms. Some compounds may exhibit polymorphism. It is to be understood that the present invention encompasses any racemic, optically-active, polymorphic, or stereoisomeric form, or mixtures thereof, of a compound of the invention, which possess the useful properties described herein, it being well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms (for example, by resolution of the racemic form by recrystallization techniques, by synthesis from optically-active starting materials, by chiral synthesis, or by chromatographic separation using a chiral stationary phase) and how to determine topoisomerase inhibition activity or cytotoxic activity using the standard tests described herein, or using other similar tests which are well known in the art. Compounds of the present invention can contain chiral centers, for example, at ring atom position 6 in formula I when R\n3\n and R\n4\n are different. Compounds of the present invention can also contain chiral centers, for example, in any of the substituents Y, Z, R\n1\n, R\n2\n when R\n3\n and R\n4\n together are =N-R\n2\n, and R\n3\n or R\n4\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn cases where compounds are sufficiently basic or acidic to form stable nontoxic acid or base salts, administration of the compounds as salts may be appropriate. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts formed with acids which form a physiological acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartarate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, α-ketoglutarate, and α-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed, including hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. Alkali metal, for example, sodium, potassium or lithium, or alkaline earth metal, for example calcium, salts of carboxylic acids can also be made.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a mammalian host, such as a human patient in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, that is, orally or parenterally, by intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the present compounds may be systemically administered, for example, orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compound may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or its salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form must be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol; propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical administration, the present compounds may be applied in pure form, i.e., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, alcohols or glycols or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which the present compounds can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver the compounds of formula I to the skin are known to the art; for example, see \n \nJacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392\n \n), \n \nGeria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478\n \n), \n \nSmith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157\n \n) and \n \nWortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful dosages of the compounds of formula I can be determined by comparing their \nin vitro\n activity, and \nin vivo\n activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the concentration of the compound(s) of formula I in a liquid composition, such as a lotion, will be from about 0.1-25 wt-%, preferably from about 0.5-10 wt-%. The concentration in a semi-solid or solid composition such as a gel or a powder will be about 0.1-5 wt-%, preferably about 0.5-2.5 wt-%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the compound, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, however, a suitable dose will be in the range of from about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg, e.g., from about 10 to about 75 mg/kg of body weight per day, such as 3 to about 50 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, preferably in the range of 6 to 90 mg/kg/day, most preferably in the range of 15 to 60 mg/kg/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound may conveniently be administered in unit dosage form; for example, containing 5 to 1000 mg, conveniently 10 to 750 mg, most conveniently, 50 to 500 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIdeally, the active ingredient should be administered to achieve peak plasma concentrations of the active compound of from about 0.5 to about 75 µM, preferably, about 1 to 50 µM, most preferably, about 2 to about 30 µM. This may be achieved, for example, by the intravenous injection of a 0.05 to 5% solution of the active ingredient, optionally in saline, or orally administered as a bolus containing about 1-100 mg of the active ingredient. Desirable blood levels may be maintained by continuous infusion to provide about 0.01-5.0 mg/kg/hr or by intermittent infusions containing about 0.4-15 mg/kg of the active ingredient(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of a compound of the invention to effect topoisomerase I or II mediated DNA cleavage can be determined using pharmacological models that are well known to the art, for example, using a model like Test A described below.\n\n\n \n \nTest\n \nA\n. \nTopoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage assay\n \n\n\n \n \n \nHuman topoisomerase I was expressed in \nE\n. \nColi\n and isolated as a recombinant fusion protein using a T7 expression system as described previously, see \nMakhey, D. et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2000, 8, 1-11\n. DNA topoisomerase I was purified from calf thymus gland as reported previously, see \nManiatis, T., et al., J. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 149-185\n). Plasmid YepG was also purified by the alkali lysis method followed by phenol deproteination and CsCl/ethidium isopycnic centrifugation method as described, see \nManiatis, T.; Fritsch, E. F.; Sambrook, J. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory: Cold Spring Harbor, NY 1982; pp 149-185\n. The end-labeling of the plasmid was accomplished by digestion with a restriction enzyme followed by end-filling with Klenow polymerase as previously described, see \nLiu, L. F.; Rowe, T. C.; Yang, L.; Tewey, K. M.; Chen, G. L., J. Biol. Chem. 1983, 258, 15365\n. Cleavage assays were performed as previously reported, see \nB. Gatto et al. Cancer Res., 1996, 56, 2795-2800\n. The drug and the DNA in presence of topoisomerase I was incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C. After development of the gels, typically 24-hour exposure was used to obtain autoradiograms outlining the extent of DNA fragmentation. Topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage values are reported as REC, Relative Effective Concentration, i.e. concentrations relative to 2,3-dimethoxy-8,9-methylenedioxybenzo[i]phenanthridine, whose value is arbitrarily assumed as 1.0, that are able to produce the same cleavage on the plasmid DNA in the presence of human topoisomerase I. Relative potency was based upon the relative amount of drug needed to induce approximately 10% DNA fragmentation. Assays are performed under the direction of \nDr. L. F. Liu, Department of Pharmacology, The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, New Jersey\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar assay can be used to evaluate the ability of a compound of the invention to effect topoisomerase II mediated DNA cleavage, by replacing the human topoisomerase I used in Test A with a suitable topoisomerase II.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCamptothecin is recognized as being among the most potent topoisomerase I inhibitors. Compound 5 has similar potency as a topoisomerase I inhibitor to Irinotecan and Topotecan, both of which are in clinical use, as well as Camptothecin in the cleavable complex assay detailed herein.\n\n \n \n \nTable 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCompound\n \n \n \n \n \nRPMI 8402\n \n \n \n \n \nCPT-K5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[µM] IC\n \n \n50\n \n \nvalues\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5\n \n0.003\n \n1.2\n \n \n \nCamptothecin\n \n0.002\n \n4.5\n \n \n \nIrinotecan\n \n0.57\n \n>100\n \n \n \nTopotecan\n \n0.005\n \n>10\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data in Table 1 demonstrate that a representative compound of the present invention can function as cytotoxic agents against tumor cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cytotoxic effects of a compound of the invention can be determined using pharmacological models that are well known to the art, for example, using a model like TestB described below.\n\n\n \n \nTest\n \nB\n. \nInhibition of Cell Growth: MTT-microtiter plate tetrazolinium cytotoxicity assay (RPMI 8402, CPT-K5, U937, U937/CR Cells)\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe cytotoxicity is determined using the MTT-microtiter plate tetrazolinium cytotoxicity assay (MTA), see \nChen A.Y. et al. Cancer Res. 1993, 53, 1332\n; \nMosmann, T. J., J. Immunol. Methods 1983, 65, 55\n; and \nCarmichael, J. et al. Cancer Res. 1987, 47, 936\n. The human lymphoblast RPMI 8402 and its camptothecin-resistant variant cell line, CPT-K5 were provided by \nDr. Toshiwo Andoh (Anchi Cancer Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan\n), see \nAndoh, T.; Okada, K, Adv. in Pharmacology 1994, 29B, 93\n. Human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells and U-937/CR cells were described by \nRubin et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1994, 269, 2433-2439\n. The cytotoxicity assay is performed by using 96-well microtiter plates using 2000 cells/well, in 200 mL of growth medium. Cells are grown in suspension at 37 °C in 5% CO\n2\n and maintained by regular passage in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, L-glutaniine (2 mM), penicillin (100U/mL), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/mL). For determination of IC\n50\n, cells are exposed continuously for 3-4 days to varying concentrations of drug, and MTT assays were performed at the end of the fourth day. Each assay is performed with a control that did not contain any drug. All assays are performed at least twice in 6 replicate wells. All assays are performed under the direction of \nDr. L. F. Liu, Department of Pharmacology, The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, New Jersey\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTopoisomerase inhibitors are also known to possess antibacterial, antifungal, antipsoritic (psoriasis), antiprotozoal, antihelmetic, and antiviral activity. Accordingly, the topoisomerase inhibitors of the invention may also be useful as antibacterial, antifungal, antipsoritic (psoriasis), antiprotozoal, antihelmetic, or antiviral agents. In particular, compounds of the invention that demonstrate little or no activity as mammalian topoisomerase I poisons, because of the possibility of similar molecular mechanism of action, could be highly active and selective antibacterial, antifungal, antipsoritic (psoriasis), antiprotozoal, antihelmetic, or antiviral agents. Thus, certain compounds of the invention may be particularly useful as systemic antibacterial, antifungal, antipsoritic (psoriasis), antiprotozoal, antihelmetic, or antiviral agents in mammals. The invention also provides the use of a compound of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament useful for producing an antibacterial, antifungal, antipsoritic (psouasis), antiprotozoal, antihelmetic, or antiviral effect in a mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"solid mammalian tumors\" include cancers of the head and neck, lung, mesothelioma, mediastinum, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, hepatobiliary system, small intestine, colon, rectum, anus, kidney, ureter, bladder, prostate, urethra, penis, testis, gynecological organs, ovarian, breast, endocrine system, skin central nervous system; sarcomas of the soft tissue and bone; and melanoma of cutaneous and intraocular origin. The term \"hematological malignancies\" includes childhood leukemia and lymphomas, Hodgkin's disease, lymphomas of lymphocytic and cutaneous origin, acute and chronic leukemia, plasma cell neoplasm and cancers associated with AIDS.

Description\n\n\n\n\n Treatment with Kallikrein Inhibitors\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application claims priority to U.S. Application Serial No. 60/956,952, filed on August 21, 2007. The disclosure of the prior application is considered part of (and is incorporated by reference in) the disclosure of this application.\n\n\nTECHNICALFIELD\n\n\nThe invention relates to the treatment of joint pathologies by the administration of an inhibitor of plasma kallikrein activity, particularly a non- naturally occurring kallikrein inhibitor, optionally in combination with viscosupplementation.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive degenerative disorder characterized by breakdown of the cartilage in the joints, deterioration of the synovial fluid present in the articular joints, and subchondral osteosclerosis accompanied by osteophyte formation. Patients with OA often exhibit severe pain that affects many aspects of their daily living. The prevalence of OA increases with age, and accounts for significant medical costs.\n\n\nSynovial fluid, which lubricates and protects the intra-articular joint surfaces, is primarily composed of the high molecular weight polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA, sodium salt of hyaluronic acid, also known as sodium hyaluronate). The concentration of HA in normal human synovial joint fluid is approximately 3 mg/ml. HA is a non-sulfated polysaccharide consisting of repeating N-acetylglucosamine and sodium glucuronate disaccharide units. HA in normal synovial fluid contains 12,500 disaccharide units for a total molecular weight (MW) of 5 MDa (Balazs et al. (1993) J. Rheumatol. Suppl., 39:3-9). In OA patients, the concentration and MW of HA in synovial fluid decreases, resulting in the diminished capacity of the fluid to protect the cartilage.\n\n\nIntra-articular injection of an viscoelastic solution containing high molecular weight HA has been shown to restore the normal homeostasis of the diseased joint. This procedure, known as viscosupplementation, has proven effective in reducing \n\n pain and enhancing joint function (see, e.g., Balazs et al. (1993) J. Rheumatol. Suppl., 39:3-9; Wobig (1998) Clin. Ther., 20(3):410-423).\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nThe invention provides methods and compositions for treating joint pathology, and for reducing pain and discomfort associated with such pathology. Examples of such pathology include osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, joint injury, cartilage pathology and pre-arthritic states. In accordance with the invention, the joint pathology is treated by administration of a non-naturally occurring inhibitor of plasma kallikrein (pKal), optionally in combination with a viscosupplement, such as a hyaluronic acid (HA)-based viscosupplement.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the treatment reduces pain associated with joint pathology such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, joint injury (e.g., repetitive motion injury), cartilage pathology (chondromalacia), or pre-arthritic states.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the treatment improves or stabilizes joint function (e.g., range of motion, walking speed, grip strength, and the like).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the treatment improves patient function (e.g., the ability of the patient to accomplish tasks of daily living). In another embodiment, the treatment stabilizes patient function (e.g., patient function does not decrease). Patient function can be measured by any of the available arthritis-related or general performance measures, such as the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), Katz index of activities of daily living (KIADL), or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the pKal inhibitor comprises or consists of the amino acid sequence GIu Ala Met His Ser Phe Cys Ala Phe Lys Ala Asp Asp GIy Pro Cys Arg Ala Ala His Pro Arg Trp Phe Phe Asn lie Phe Thr Arg GIn Cys GIu GIu Phe He Tyr GIy GIy Cys GIu GIy Asn GIn Asn Arg Phe GIu Ser Leu GIu GIu Cys Lys Lys Met Cys Thr Arg Asp (SEQ ID NO:2), or a fragment thereof, such as amino acids 3-60 of SEQ ID NO:2.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the non-naturally occurring pKal inhibitor is administered in combination with a viscosupplementation therapy. Such combination therapy may involve intraarticular administration of a mixture of a pKal inhibitor and a viscosupplement, separate intraarticular administrations of a pKal inhibitor and a viscosupplement, or systemic (e.g., parenteral, such as intravenous (i.v.) or \n\n subcutaneous injection) administration of the pKal inhibitor and local (intraarticular) administration of the viscosupplement. In this embodiment, the pKal inhibitor may comprise or consist of the amino acid sequence GIu Ala Met His Ser Phe Cys Ala Phe Lys Ala Asp Asp GIy Pro Cys Arg Ala Ala His Pro Arg Trp Phe Phe Asn He Phe Thr Arg GIn Cys GIu GIu Phe lie Tyr GIy GIy Cys GIu GIy Asn GIn Asn Arg Phe GIu Ser Leu GIu GIu Cys Lys Lys Met Cys Thr Arg Asp (SEQ ID NO:2), or a fragment thereof, such as amino acids 3-60 of SEQ ID NO:2. In some embodiments in which the pKal inhibitor consists of or comprises amino acids 3-60 of SEQ ID NO:2, the viscosupplement is hylan G-F 20 (e.g., SYNVISC®). In one aspect, the invention provides kits for the treatment of joint pathology.\n\n\nThe kits include a non-naturally occurring inhibitor of pKal, and instructions for administering the inhibitor to a subject having a joint pathology.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the kit further includes instructions for administration of viscosupplement, and may optionally contain the viscosupplement. In another aspect, provided herein is the use of a non-naturally occurring pKal inhibitor for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of joint pathology. The medicament may optionally include a viscosupplement.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the medicament containing the non-naturally occurring pKal inhibitor is intended or adapted for use in a combination therapy with a viscosupplement.\n\n\nThe non-naturally occurring kallikrein inhibitor used in any disclosed method, kit or composition can have one or more of the characteristics described below.\n\n\nThe kallikrein inhibitor can have a Ki for plasma kallikrein of less than 50 nM, 40 nM, 30 nM, 20 nM, 5 nM, 1 nM, 500 pM, 100 pM, 50 pM, e.g., about 44 pM. The pKal inhibitor can preferentially inhibit pKal at least 100, 200, 500, or 1000 more than another kallikrein, e.g., human urine kallikrein, or another protease, e.g., plasmin or thrombin.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the kallikrein inhibitor includes a polypeptide that includes a Kunitz domain such as the amino acid sequence: Xaal Xaa2 Xaa3 Xaa4 Cys Xaa6 Xaa7 Xaa8 Xaa9 XaalO Xaal 1 GIy Xaal3 Cys Xaal5 Xaal6 Xaal7 Xaal8 Xaal 9 Xaa20 Xaa21 Xaa22 Xaa23 Xaa24 Xaa25 Xaa26 Xaa27 Xaa28 Xaa29 Cys Xaa31 Xaa32 Phe Xaa34 Xaa35 GIy GIy Cys Xaa39 Xaa40 Xaa41 Xaa42 Xaa43 \n\n Xaa44 Xaa45 Xaa46 Xaa47 Xaa48 Xaa49 Xaa50 Cys Xaa52 Xaa53 Xaa54 Cys Xaa56 Xaa57 Xaa58 (SEQ ID NO 1)\n\n\nThe framework of the Kunitz domain can be human or can differ from a human Kunitz domain framework by fewer than six, five, four, three, or two ammo acids For example, the framework of the Kumtz domain can be the framework of one of the Kumtz domains of human hpoprotem-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) protem, e g , the first second or third Kunitz domain LACI is also known as \"Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitoi\" or \"TFPI\" Typically, the polypeptide differs from BPTI and/or one or more of the LACI Kumtz domains by at least one, two, three, oi four ammo acids, e g , at least one, two or three ammo acids in the binding loops and/or at least two, three, fom, or six ammo acids in the framework region For example, the polypeptide can include a non-naturally occurring Kunitz domain that is derived from a naturally occurring Kumtz domain, e g , a human Kunitz domain In one embodiment, an inhibitor that includes a Kunitz domain binds to plasma kallikrein with an affinity that is at least 10, 100, or 500 fold better than BPTI and/or LACI\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the polypeptide that inhibits kallikrem is not immunogenic on second use\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the polypeptide that inhibits kallikrem can have one or more of the following features Xaal, Xaa2, Xaa3, Xaa4, Xaa56, Xaa57 or Xaa58 aie each individually an ammo acid or absent, XaalO is an ammo acid selected from the group consisting of Asp and GIu, Xaal 1 is an ammo acid selected from the group consisting of Asp, GIy, Ser, VaI, Asn, He, Ala and Thr, Xaal 3 is an ammo acid selected from the gioup consisting of Aig, His, Pro, Asn, Ser, Thr, Ala, GIy, Lys and GIn, Xaal5 is an ammo acid selected fiom the gioup consisting of Arg, Lys, Ala, Ser, GIy, Met, Asn and GIn, Xaalβ is an ammo acid selected from the group consisting of Ala, GIy, Sei, Asp and Asn, Xaal7 is an ammo acid selected from the group consisting of Ala, Asn, Sei, He, GIy, VaI, GIn and Thr, Xaal 8 is an ammo acid selected fiom the gioup consisting of His, Leu, GIn and Ala, Xaal9 is an ammo acid selected from the group consisting of Pio, GIn, Leu, Asn and He, Xaa21 is an ammo acid selected fiom the gioup consisting of Trp, Phe, Tyr, His and He, Xaa22 is an ammo acid selected fiom the gioup consisting of Tyr and Phe, Xaa23 is an ammo acid selected fiom the gioup consisting of Tyi and Phe, Xaa31 is an ammo acid \n\n selected from the group consisting of: GIu, Asp, GIn, Asn, Ser, Ala, VaI, Leu, He and Thr; Xaa32 is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of: GIu, GIn, Asp Asn, Pro, Thr, Leu, Ser, Ala, GIy and VaI; Xaa34 is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of: Thr, He, Ser, VaI, Ala, Asn, GIy and Leu; Xaa35 is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of: Tyr, Trp and Phe; Xaa39 is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of: GIu, GIy, Ala, Ser and Asp; Xaa40 is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of: GIy and Ala; Xaa43 is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of: Asn and GIy; Xaa45 is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of: Phe and Tyr; and wherein the polypeptide inhibits kallikrein.\n\n\nIn a particular embodiment, individual amino acid positions of a kallikrein inhibitor that includes the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 has one or more of the following: XaalO is Asp, Xaal 1 is Asp, Xaal3 is Pro, Xaal5 is Arg, Xaalβ is Ala, Xaal7 is Ala, Xaal8 is His, Xaal9 is Pro, Xaa21 is Trp, Xaa31 is GIu, Xaa32 is GIu, Xaa34 is lie, Xaa35 is Tyr, Xaa39 is GIu.\n\n\nThe polypeptide that inhibits kallikrein can include (or consist of) the following amino acid sequence: Met His Ser Phe Cys Ala Phe Lys Ala Asp Asp GIy Pro Cys Arg Ala Ala His Pro Arg Trp Phe Phe Asn He Phe Thr Arg GIn Cys GIu GIu Phe He Tyr GIy GIy Cys GIu GIy Asn GIn Asn Arg Phe GIu Ser Leu GIu GIu Cys Lys Lys Met Cys Thr Arg Asp (amino acids 3-60 of SEQ ID NO:2), or a fragment thereof, e.g., a fragment that binds and inhibits kallikrein. For example, the polypeptide can have fewer than 80, 70, 65, 60, 58, 55 or 52 amino acids.\n\n\nThe polypeptide that inhibits kallikrein can include (or consist of) a polypeptide described in U.S. Patent No: 5,786,328, the contents of which are incorporated by reference.\n\n\nMethods, kits and compositions described herein can include an inhibitor that comprises a non-naturally occurring Kunitz domain polypeptide having any of the amino acid sequences described herein and an additional flanking sequence of one to six amino acids at the amino and/or carboxy terminal end domains. Such additional amino acids may be artifacts of expressing a particular non-naturally occurring kallikrein inhibitor polypeptide or Kunitz domain polypeptide in any of a variety of recombinant expression vector systems, such as used in yeast, bacteria, mammalian cell lines, insect cells, and the like. Preferably, such additional amino acids at the \n\n amino and/or carboxy termini of a non-naturally occurring Kunitz domain described herein do not diminish the affinity for kallikrein or kallikrein inhibition activity of the domain or a polypeptide comprising the domain.\n\n\nThe inhibitor polypeptide can include a non-naturally occurring Kunitz domain polypeptide having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 and an amino terminal flanking sequence as the result of producing the polypeptide as a recombinant protein in yeast.

A particularly preferred species of an inhibitor polypeptide of the invention produced in a yeast expression system has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ED NO:2:\n\n\nGIu Ala Met His Ser Phe Cys Ala Phe Lys Ala Asp Asp GIy Pro Cys Arg Ala Ala His Pro Arg Trp Phe Phe Asn He Phe Thr Arg GIn Cys GIu GIu Phe He Tyr GIy GIy Cys GIu GIy Asn GIn Asn Arg Phe GIu Ser Leu GIu GIu Cys Lys Lys Met Cys Thr Arg Asp (SEQ ID NO:2). In one embodiment, the polypeptide that inhibits pKal is modified, e.g., to include one or more moieties, e.g., one or more moieties that extend half life of the polypeptide, e.g., a polymer moiety or a plurality of polymer moieties, e.g., as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0089515. For example, the polypeptide can include a plurality of polyethylene glycol moieties, e.g., one on an N- terminal amine and one attached to each lysine of the polypeptide. The polyethylene glycol moieties can be less than 10, 8, 7, or 6 kDa in average molecular weight. In other embodiments, the moiety can be, e.g., serum albumin, e.g., human serum albumin. Other exemplary modifications include a label, e.g., a radioactive or MRI- detectable label. In some embodiments, the polypeptide is part of a mixture that includes modified and unmodified polypeptides that inhibit kallikrein. For example, the mixture can include one or more modified polypeptides that inhibit kallikrein and that include a polymer moiety such as a polyethylene glycol moiety and one or more unmodified polypeptides that inhibit kallikrein and do not include a polymer moiety. \n\n In one embodiment, approximately 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or all of the polypeptides that inhibit kallikrein in the mixture are modified.\n\n\nThe pKal inhibitor polypeptides useful in the methods, compositions and kits may be any of the non-naturally occurring Kunitz domain polypeptides described herein or larger polypeptides comprising any such Kunitz domains, provided the pKal inhibitor polypeptides bind and inhibit pKal as determined in standard assays.\n\n\nThe methods described herein include administering an effective amount of the non-naturally occurring pKal inhibitor.

The domain is folded such that the first and sixth cysteines, the second and fourth, and the third and fifth cysteines form disulfide bonds (e.g., in a Kunitz domain having 58 amino acids, cysteines can be present at positions corresponding to amino acids 5, 14, 30, 38, 51, and 55, according to the number of the BPTI homologous sequences provided below, and disulfides can form between the cysteines at position 5 and 55, 14 and 38, and 30 and 51), or, if two disulfides are present, they can form between a corresponding subset of cysteines thereof. The spacing between respective cysteines can be within 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 or 0 amino acids of the following spacing between positions corresponding to: 5 to 55, 14 to 38, and 30 to 51, according to the numbering of the BPTI sequence provided below. The BPTI sequence can be used as a reference to refer to specific positions in any generic Kunitz domain. Comparison of a Kunitz domain of interest to BPTI can be performed by identifying the best fit \n\n alignment in which the number of aligned cysteines in maximized.\n\n\nThe 3D structure (at high resolution) of the Kunitz domain of BPTI is known. One of the X-ray structures is deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank as \"6PTI\". The 3D structure of some BPTI homologues (Eigenbrot et al., (1990) Protein Engineering, 3(7):591-598; Hynes et al., (1990) Biochemistry, 29: 10018-10022) are known. At least eighty one Kunitz domain sequences are known. Known human homologues include three Kunitz domains of LACI (Wun et al., (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263(13):6001-6004; Girard et al., (1989) Nature, 338:518-20; Novotny et al, (1989) J. Biol. Chem., 264(31):18832-18837) two Kunitz domains of Inter-α-Trypsin Inhibitor, APP-I (Kido et al, (1988) J. Biol. Chem., 263(34): 18104-18107), a Kunitz domain from collagen, three Kunitz domains of TFPI-2 (Sprecher et al., (1994) PNAS USA, 91:3353-3357), the Kunitz domains of hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 1 , the Kunitz domains of Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 2, the Kunitz domains described in U.S. Patent Publication No.: 20040152633. LACI is a human serum phosphoglycoprotein with a molecular weight of 39 kDa (amino acid sequence in Table 1) containing three Kunitz domains.\n\n\nTable l:Exemplary Natural Kunitz Domains\n\n\nLACI : (SEQ ID 1 MIYTMKKVHA LWASVCLLLN LAPAPLNAds eedeehtiit dtelpplklM NO. 54) 51 HSFCAFKADD GPCKAIMKRF FFNIFTRQCE EFIYGGCEGN QNRFESLEEC\n\n\n101 KKMCTRDnan riikttlqqe kpdfCfleed pqiCrgyitr yfynnqtkqC\n\n\n151 erfkygqClg nmnnfetlee CkniCedgpn gfqvdnygtq lnavnnsltp\n\n\n201 qstkvpslfe fhgpswCltp adrglCrane nrfyynsvig kCrpfkysgC\n\n\n251 ggnennftsk qeClraCkkg fiqriskggl lktkrkrkkq rvkiayeeif\n\n\n301 vknm\n\n\nThe signal sequence (1-28) is uppercase and underscored LACI-Kl (50-107) is uppercase LACI-K2 (121-178) is underscored LACI-K3 (211-270) is bold\n\n\nBPTI 1 2 3 4 5 (SEQ ID 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678 NO:55) RPDFCLEPPYTGPCKARIIRYFYNAKAGLCQTFVYGGCRAKRNNFKSAEDCMRTCGGA\n\n\nThe Kunitz domains above are referred to as LACI-Kl (lesidues 50 to 107), LACI-K2 (residues 121 to 178), and LACI-K3 (213 to 270). The cDNA sequence of LACI is reported in Wun et al. (J. Biol. Chem., 1988, 263(13):6001-6004). Girard et al. (Nature, 1989, 338:518-20) reports mutational studies in which the Pl residues of each of the three Kunitz domains were altered. LACI-Kl inhibits Factor Vila (RVIIa) when RVIIa is complexed to tissue factor and LACI-K2 inhibits Factor Xa. \n\n Proteins containing exemplary Kunitz domains include the following, with SWISS-PROT Accession Numbers in parentheses:\n\n\nA4_HUMAN (P05067) , A4_MACFA (P53601), A4_MACMU (P29216),\n\n\nA4_M0USE (P12023) , A4_RAT (P08592), A4_SAISC (Q95241),\n\n\nAMBP_PLEPL (P36992) APP2_HUMAN (Q06481), APP2_RAT (P15943),\n\n\nAXP1_ANTAF (P81547) AXP2_ANTAF (P81548), BPT1_BOVIN (P00974)\n\n\nBPT2_B0VIN (P04815) CA17_HUMAN (Q02388) , CA36_CHICK (P15989)\n\n\nCA36_HUMAN (P12111) CRPT_B00MI (P81162) , ELAC_MACEU (062845)\n\n\nELAC_TRIVU (Q29143) EPPI\nN\nHUMAN (095925) , EPPI_MOUSE (Q9DA01)\n\n\nHTIB_MANSE (P26227) IBP_CARCR (P00993) , IBPC BOVIN (P00976)\n\n\nIBPI_TACTR (P16044) IBPS_BOVIN (P00975) , ICS3_B0MM0 (P07481)\n\n\nIMAP_DROFU (P11424) IP52_ANESU (P10280) , ISC1_BOMMO (P10831) ,\n\n\nISC2_BOMMO (P10832) ISH1_STOHE (P31713), ISH2_STOHE (P81129) ,\n\n\nISIKJELPO (P00994) ISP2_GALME (P81906) , IVB1_BUNFA (P25660) ,\n\n\nIVB1_BUNMU (P00987) IVB1_VIPAA (P00991) , IVB2_BUNMU (P00989) ,\n\n\nIVB2_DABRU (P00990) IVB2_HEMHA (P00985) , IVB2_NAJNI (P00986) ,\n\n\nIVB3_VIPAA (P00992) IVBB_DENP0 (P00983) , IVBC_NAJNA (P19859) ,\n\n\nIVBC_OPHHA (P82966) IVBE_DENPO (P00984) , IVBI_DENAN (P00980) ,\n\n\nIVBI_DENPO (P00979) IVBK_DENAN (P00982) , IVBK_DENPO (P00981) ,\n\n\nIVBT_ERIMA (P24541) IVBT_NAJNA (P20229) , MCPI_MELCP (P82968) ,\n\n\nSBPI_SARBU (P26228) SPT3_HUMAN (P49223) , TKD1_BOVIN (Q28201),\n\n\nTKD1_SHEEP (Q29428) TXCA_DENAN (P81658) , UPTI PIG (Q29100) ,\n\n\nAMBP_BOVIN (P00978) AMBP_HUMAN (P02760) , AMBP_MERUN (Q62577),\n\n\nAMBP_MESAU (Q60559) AMBP_MOUSE (Q07456), AMBP_PIG (P04366),\n\n\nAMBP_RAT (Q64240) , IATRJORSE (P04365) , IATR__SHEEP (P13371),\n\n\nSPT1_HUMAN (043278) SPT1_MOUSE (Q9R097), SPT2_HUMAN (04329I)\n1\n \n\n\nSPT2_MOUSE (Q9WU03) TFP2_HUMAN (P48307), TFP2_M0USE (035536),\n\n\nTFPI_HUMAN (P10646) TFPI_MACMU (Q28864), TFPI_MOUSE (054819),\n\n\nTFPI RABIT (P19761) TFPI_RAT (Q02445) , YN81_CAEEL (Q03610)\n\n\nA variety of methods can be used to identify a Kunitz domain from a sequence database. For example, a known amino acid sequence of a Kunitz domain, a consensus sequence, or a motif (e.g., the ProSite Motif) can be searched against the GenBank sequence databases (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda MD), e.g., using BLAST; against Pfam database of HMMs (Hidden Markov Models) (e.g., using default parameters for Pfam searching; against the SMART database; or against the ProDom database. For example, the Pfam Accession Number PF00014 of Pfam Release 9 provides numerous Kunitz domains and an HMM for identify Kunitz domains. A description of the Pfam database can be found in Sonhammer et al. (1997) Proteins 28(3):405-420 and a detailed description of HMMs can be found, for example, in Gribskov et al. (1990) Meth. Enzymol. 183: 146-159; Gribskov et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 84:4355-4358; Krogh et al. (1994) J. MoI. Biol. 235: 1501-1531 ; and Stultz et al. (1993) Protein Sci. 2:305-314. The SMART database (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool, EMBL, Heidelberg, DE) of HMMs as described in Schultz et al.\n\n\n(1998), Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 95:5857 and Schultz et al. (2000) Nucl. Acids Res \n\n 28:231. The SMART database contains domains identified by profiling with the hidden Markov models of the HMMer2 search program (R. Durbin et al. (1998) Biological sequence analysis: probabilistic models of proteins and nucleic acids. Cambridge University Press). The database also is annotated and monitored. The ProDom protein domain database consists of an automatic compilation of homologous domains (Corpet et al. (1999), Nucl. Acids Res. 27:263-267). Current versions of ProDom are built using recursive PSI-BLAST searches (Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402; Gouzy et al. (1999) Computers and Chemistry 23:333-340.) of the SWISS-PROT 38 and TREMBL protein databases. The database automatically generates a consensus sequence for each domain. Prosite lists the Kunitz domain as a motif and identifies proteins that include a Kunitz domain. See, e.g., Falquet et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 30:235-238(2002).\n\n\nKunitz domains interact with target protease using, primarily, amino acids in two loop regions (\"binding loops\"). The first loop region is between about residues corresponding to amino acids 13-20 of BPTI. The second loop region is between about residues corresponding to amino acids 31-39 of BPTI. An exemplary library of Kunitz domains varies one or more amino acid positions in the first and/or second loop regions. Particularly useful positions to vary, when screening for Kunitz domains that interact with kallikrein or when selecting for improved affinity variants, include: positions 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 31, 32, 34, and 39 with respect to the sequence of BPTI. At least some of these positions are expected to be in close contact with the target protease. It is also useful to vary other positions, e.g., positions that are adjacent to the aforementioned positions in the three-dimensional structure.\n\n\nThe \"framework region\" of a Kunitz domain is defined as those residues that are a part of the Kunitz domain, but specifically excluding residues in the first and second binding loops regions, i.e., about residues corresponding to amino acids 13-20 of BPTI and 31-39 of BPTI. Conversely, residues that are not in the binding loop may tolerate a wider range of amino acid substitution (e.g., conservative and/or non- conservative substitutions). In one embodiment, these Kunitz domains are variant forms of the looped structure including Kunitz domain 1 of human lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) protein. LACI contains three internal, well-defined, peptide loop structures that are paradigm Kunitz domains (Girard, T. et al., 1989. Nature, 338:518- \n\n 520). Variants of Kunitz domain 1 of LACI described herein have been screened, isolated and bind kallikrein with enhanced affinity and specificity (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,795,865 and 6,057,287, incorporated herein by reference). These methods can also be applied to other Kunitz domain frameworks to obtain other Kunitz domains that interact with kallikrein, e.g., plasma kallikrein. Useful modulators of kallikrein function typically bind and/or inhibit kallikrein, as determined using kallikrein binding and inhibition assays.\n\n\nAn exemplary polypeptide that includes a Kunitz domain that inhibits kallikrein has the amino acid sequence defined by amino acids 3-60 of SEQ ID NO:2. An exemplary polypeptide includes the amino acid sequence:\n\n\nXaal Xaa2 Xaa3 Xaa4 Cys Xaa6 Xaa7 Xaa8 Xaa9 XaalO Xaal 1 GIy Xaal3 Cys Xaal5 Xaal6 Xaal7 Xaal8 Xaal9 Xaa20 Xaa21 Xaa22 Xaa23 Xaa24 Xaa25 Xaa26 Xaa27 Xaa28 Xaa29 Cys Xaa31 Xaa32 Phe Xaa34 Xaa35 GIy GIy Cys Xaa39 Xaa40 Xaa41 Xaa42 Xaa43 Xaa44 Xaa45 Xaa46 Xaa47 Xaa48 Xaa49 Xaa50 Cys Xaa52 Xaa53 Xaa54 Cys Xaa56 Xaa57 Xaa58 (SEQ ID NO: 1).\n\n\n\"Xaa\" refers to a position in a peptide chain that can be any of a number of different amino acids. In a first example, Xaa can by any amino acid except cysteine. In another example, one or more of the following apply: XaalO can be Asp or GIu; Xaal 1 can be Asp, GIy, Ser, VaI, Asn, He, Ala or Thr; Xaal3 can be Pro, Arg, His, Asn, Ser, Thr, Ala, GIy, Lys or GIn; Xaal 5 can be Arg, Lys, Ala, Ser, GIy, Met, Asn or GIn; Xaalό can be Ala, GIy, Ser, Asp or Asn; Xaal7 can be Ala, Asn, Ser, He, GIy, VaI, GIn or Thr; Xaal 8 can be His, Leu, GIn or Ala; Xaal9 can be Pro, GIn, Leu, Asn or He; Xaa21 can be Trp, Phe, Tyr, His or He; Xaa31 can be GIu, Asp, GIn, Asn, Ser, Ala, VaI, Leu, He or Thr; Xaa32 can be GIu, GIn, Asp Asn, Pro, Thr, Leu, Ser, Ala, GIy or VaI; Xaa34 can be He, Thr, Ser, VaI, Ala, Asn, GIy or Leu; Xaa35 can be Tyr, Tip or Phe; Xaa39 can be GIu, GIy, Ala, Ser or Asp. Amino acids Xaa6, Xaa7, Xaa8, Xaa9, Xaa20, Xaa24, Xaa25, Xaa26, Xaa27, Xaa28, Xaa29, Xaa41, Xaa42, Xaa44, Xaa46, Xaa47, Xaa48, Xaa49, Xaa50, Xaa52, Xaa53 and Xaa54 can be any amino acid. Additionally, each of the first four and at last three amino acids of SEQ ID\n\n\nNO: 1 can optionally be present or absent and can be any amino acid, if present, e.g., any non-cysteine amino acid. \n\n In one embodiment, the polypeptide has a sequence with one or more of the following properties: Xaal 1 can be Asp, GIy, Ser or VaI; Xaal3 can be Pro, Arg, His or Asn; Xaal5 can be Arg or Lys; Xaalό can be Ala or GIy; Xaal7 can be Ala, Asn, Ser or He; Xaal8 can be His, Leu or GIn; Xaal9 can be Pro, GIn or Leu; Xaa21 can be Trp or Phe; Xaa31 is GIu; Xaa32 can be GIu or GIn; Xaa34 can be lie, Thr or Ser; Xaa35 is Tyr; and Xaa39 can be GIu, GIy or Ala.\n\n\nAn exemplary polypeptide can include the following amino acids: XaalO is Asp; Xaal 1 is Asp; Xaal3 can be Pro or Arg; Xaal5 is Arg; Xaalό can be Ala or GIy; Xaal7 is Ala; Xaalδ is His; Xaal9 is Pro; Xaa21 is Trp; Xaa31 is GIu; Xaa32 is GIu; Xaa34 can be He or Ser; Xaa35 is Tyr; and Xaa39 is GIy.\n\n\nIt is also possible to use portions of the polypeptides described herein. For example, polypeptides could include binding domains for specific kallikrein epitopes. For example, the binding loops of Kunitz domains can by cyclized and used in isolation or can be grafted onto another domain, e.g., a framework of another Kunitz domain. It is also possible to remove one, two, three, or four amino acids from the N- terminus of an amino acid sequence described herein, and/or one, two, three, four, or five amino acids from the C-terminus of an amino acid sequence described herein.\n\n\nExamples of sequences encompassed by SEQ K) NO: 1 are described by the following (where not indicated, \"Xaa\" refers to any amino acid, any

In another example, neither the first nor the second binding loop differs from an amino acid sequence described herein, e.g., an amino acid sequence provided above.\n\n\nFIGS. 2A and 2B provide an amino acid sequence alignment of these sequences, the native LACI sequence from which these variants were derived (SEQ ID NO:32), and other known Kunitz domains (SEQ ID NOS: 29-31 and 33-53). Still others polypeptides that inhibit kallikrein include an about 58-amino acid sequence of amino acids 3-60 of SEQ ID NO:2 or the PEP-I polypeptide having the 60-amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2. The term \"PEP-I\" and \"DX-88\" as used herein refer to the 60-amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. A nucleotide sequence encoding the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 is provided in SEQ ID NO:3 (see, e.g., nucleotides 309-488 in FIG. 1). It is understood that based on the known genetic code, degenerate forms of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:3 can be obtained by simply substituting one or more of the known degenerate codons for each amino acid encoded by the nucleotide sequence. Nucleotides 7-180 of SEQ ID NO:3, and degenerate forms thereof, encode the non-naturally occurring Kunitz domain polypeptide that includes the 58-amino acid sequence of amino acids 3-60 of SEQ ID NO:2, a related sequence, or a functional fragment thereof.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the polypeptide is other than aprotinin, e.g., differs from aprotinin, by at least one, two, three, five, ten, or fifteen amino acids.\n\n\nPolypeptides described herein can be made synthetically using any standard polypeptide synthesis protocol and equipment. For example, the stepwise synthesis of a polypeptide can be carried out by the removal of an amino (N) terminal-protecting group from an initial (i.e., carboxy-terminal) amino acid, and coupling thereto of the carboxyl end of the next amino acid in the sequence of the polypeptide. This amino acid is also suitably protected. The carboxyl group of the incoming amino acid can be activated to react with the N-terminus of the bound amino acid by formation into a reactive group such as formation into a carbodiimide, a symmetric acid anhydride, or an \"active ester\" group such as hydroxybenzotriazole or pentafluorophenyl esters. Preferred solid-phase peptide synthesis methods include the BOC method, which utilizes tert-butyloxycarbonyl as the I-amino protecting group, and the FMOC method, which utilizes 9-fluorenylmethloxycarbonyl to protect the alpha-amino of the amino acid lesidues. Both methods aie well known to those of skill in the ait \n\n (Stewart, J. and Young, J., Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (W. H. Freeman Co., San Francisco 1989); Merrifield, J., 1963. Am. Chem. Soc, 85:2149-2154; Bodanszky, M. and Bodanszky, A., The Practice of Peptide Synthesis (Springer- Verlag, New York 1984)). If desired, additional amino- and/or carboxy-terminal amino acids can be designed into the amino acid sequence and added during polypeptide synthesis.\n\n\nPolypeptides can also be produced using recombinant technology. Recombinant methods can employ any of a number of cells and corresponding expression vectors, including but not limited to bacterial expression vectors, yeast expression vectors, baculovirus expression vectors, mammalian viral expression vectors, and the like. A polypeptide described herein can be produced by a transgenic animal, e.g., in the mammary gland of a transgenic animal. In some cases, it could be necessary or advantageous to fuse the coding sequence for a polypeptide that inhibits kallikrein (e.g., a polypeptide that includes a Kunitz domain) to another coding sequence in an expression vector to form a fusion polypeptide that is readily expressed in a host cell. Part or all of the additional sequence can be removed, e.g., by protease digestion.\n\n\nAn exemplary recombinant expression system for producing a polypeptide that inhibits kallikrein (e.g., a polypeptide that includes a Kunitz domain) is a yeast expression vector, which permits a nucleic acid sequence encoding the amino acid sequence for the inhibitor polypeptide to be linked in the same reading frame with a nucleotide sequence encoding the MATα prepro leader peptide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which in turn is under the control of an operable yeast promoter. The resulting recombinant yeast expression plasmid can be transformed by standard methods into the cells of an appropriate, compatible yeast host, which cells are able to express the recombinant protein from the recombinant yeast expression vector. Preferably, a host yeast cell transformed with such a recombinant expression vector is also able to process the fusion protein to provide an active inhibitor polypeptide. An other exemplary yeast host for producing recombinant polypeptides is Pichia pastoris. As noted above, polypeptides that inhibit kallikrein can include a Kunitz domain polypeptide described herein. Some polypeptides can include an additional flanking sequence, preferably of one to six amino acids in length, at the amino and/or carboxy-terminal end, provided such additional amino acids do not significantly \n\n dimmish kallikrein binding affinity or kalhkrein inhibition activity so as to preclude use in the methods and compositions described herein Such additional amino acids can be deliberately added to express a polypeptide in a particular recombinant host cell or can be added to provide an additional function, e g , to provide a linker to another molecule or to provide an affinity moiety that facilitates purification of the polypeptide Preferably, the additional ammo acid(s) do not include cysteine, which could interfere with the disulfide bonds of the Kumtz domain\n\n\nAn exemplary Kumtz domain polypeptide includes the ammo acid sequence of residues 3-60 of SEQ ID NO 2 When expressed and processed in a yeast fusion protein expression system (e g , based on the integrating expression plasmid pHIL- D2), such a Kumtz domain polypeptide retains an additional amino terminal GIu- Ala dipeptide from the fusion with the MATalpha-prepro leadei peptide sequence of S cerevisiae When secreted from the yeast host cell, most of the leader peptide is processed from the fusion protein to yield a functional polypeptide (lefeired to herein as \"PEP-I \") having the ammo acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 (see boxed region in FIG 1)\n\n\nA typical Kumtz domain, e g , that includes, SEQ ID NO 1 , contains a number of invariant positions, e g , positions coπespondmg to position 5, 14, 30, 33, 38, 45, 51 and 55 in the BPTI numbering scheme aie cysteine The spacing between these positions may vary to the extent allowable within the Kumtz domain fold, e g , such that thiee disulfide bonds are formed Othei positions such as, foi example, positions 6, 7, 8, 9, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 41, 42, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52, 53 and 54, or positions corresponding to those positions, can be any ammo acid (including non- genetically encoded occurring ammo acids) In a paiticulaily piefeired embodiment, one or more ammo acids coirespond to that of a native sequence (e g , SEQ ID\n\n\nNO 32, see FIGS 2A and 2B) In another embodiment, at least one vaπable position is diffeient from that of the native sequence In yet another piefeπed embodiment, the ammo acids can each be individually or collectively substituted by a conseivative or non-conservative ammo acid substitution Conseivative ammo acid substitutions ieplace an ammo acid with another ammo acid of similai chemical nature and may have no affect on piotein function Non-conseivative ammo acid substitutions replace an ammo acid with anothei ammo acid of dissimilai chemical structure Examples of consei ved ammo acid substitutions \n\n include, for example, Asn->Gln, Arg->Lys and Ser->Thr. In a preferred embodiment, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and/or 21 of these amino acids can be independently or collectively, in any combination, selected to correspond to the corresponding position of SEQ ID NO:2. Other positions, for example, positions 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22,\n\n\n23, 31, 32, 34, 35, 39, 40, 43 and 45, or positions corresponding to those positions can be any of a selected set of amino acids. For example, SEQ ID NO: 1 defines a set of possible sequences. Each member of this set contains, for example, a cysteine at positions 5, 14, 30, 51 and 55, and any one of a specific set of amino acids at positions 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 34, 35, 39, 40, 43 and 45, or positions corresponding to those positions. In a preferred embodiment, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and/or 19 of these amino acids can be independently or collectively, in any combination, selected to correspond to the corresponding position of SEQ ID NO:2. The polypeptide preferably has at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95, 97, 98, or 99% identity to SEQ ID NO:2.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"substantially identical\" (or \"substantially homologous\") is used herein to refer to a first amino acid or nucleotide sequence that contains a sufficient number of identical or equivalent (e.g., with a similar side chain, e.g., conserved amino acid substitutions) amino acid residues or nucleotides to a second amino acid or nucleotide sequence such that the first and second amino acid or nucleotide sequences have similar activities. In the case of antibodies, the second antibody has the same specificity and has at least 50% of the affinity of the same. Calculations of \"homology\" between two sequences can be performed as follows. The sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% of the length of the reference sequence. The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position \n\n in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid \"identity\" is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid \"homology\"). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences.\n\n\nThe comparison of sequences and determination of percent homology between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. In a preferred embodiment, the percent homology between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman and Wunsch (1970), J. MoI. Biol. 48:444-453, algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package , using either a Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In yet another preferred embodiment, the percent homology between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package, using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. A particularly preferred set of parameters (and the one that should be used if the practitioner is uncertain about what parameters should be applied to determine if a molecule is within a homology limitation) are a Blossum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5.\n\n\nUseful polypeptides can also be encoded by a nucleic acid that hybridizes to a nucleic acid that encodes a polypeptide described herein. The nucleic acids can hybridize under medium, high, or very high stringency conditions. As used herein, the term \"hybridizes under low stringency, medium stringency, high stringency, or very high stringency conditions\" describes conditions for hybridization and washing. Guidance for performing hybridization reactions can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6, which is incorporated by reference. Aqueous and nonaqueous methods are described in that reference and either can be used. Specific hybridization conditions referred to herein are as follows: (1) low stringency hybridization conditions in 6X sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45\nC\nC, followed by two washes in 0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at least at 50\n0\nC (the temperature of the washes can be increased to 55°C for low stringency conditions); (2) medium stringency hybridization conditions in 6X \n\n SSC at about 45°C, followed by one or more washes in 0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60\n0\nC; (3) high stringency hybridization conditions in 6X SSC at about 45\n0\nC, followed by one or more washes in 0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65\n0\nC; and (4) very high stringency hybridization conditions are 0.5M sodium phosphate, 7% SDS at 65°C, followed by one or more washes at 0.2X SSC, 1 % SDS at 65°C.\n\n\nModifications\n\n\nIt is possible to modify polypeptides that inhibit a Kunitz domain in a variety of ways. For example, the polypeptides can be attached to one or more polyethylene glycol moieties to stabilize the compound or prolong retention times, e.g., by at least 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 50, 100, 500 or 1000 fold.\n\n\nA polypeptide that inhibits kallikrein can be associated with (e.g., conjugated to) a polymer, e.g., a substantially non-antigenic polymers, such as polyalkylene oxides or polyethylene oxides. Suitable polymers will vary substantially by weight. Polymers having molecular number average weights ranging from about 200 to about 35,000 (or about 1,000 to about 15,000, and 2,000 to about 12,500) can be used. A plurality of polymer moieties can be attached to one polypeptide, e.g., at least two, three, or four such moieties, e.g., having an average molecular weight of about 2,000 to 7,000 Daltons.\n\n\nFor example, the polypeptide can be conjugated to a water soluble polymer, e.g., hydrophilic polyvinyl polymers, e.g. polyvinylalcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone.. A non-limiting list of such polymers include polyalkylene oxide homopolymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polypropylene glycols, polyoxyethylenated polyols, copolymers thereof and block copolymers thereof, provided that the water solubility of the block copolymers is maintained. Additional useful polymers include polyoxyalkylenes such as polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene, and block copolymers of polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene (Pluronics); polymethacrylates; carbomers; branched or unbranched polysaccharides which comprise the saccharide monomers D-mannose, D- and L-galactose, fucose, fructose, D-xylose, L-arabinose, D- glucuronic acid, sialic acid, D-galacturonic acid, D-mannuronic acid (e.g. polymannuronic acid, or alginic acid), D-glucosamine, D-galactosamine, D-glucose and neuraminic acid including homopolysaccharides and heteiopolysaccharides such as lactose, amylopectin, staich, hydioxyethyl staich, amylose, dextiane sulfate, \n\n dextran, dextrins, glycogen, or the polysaccharide subunit of acid mucopolysaccharides, e.g. hyaluronic acid; polymers of sugar alcohols such as polysorbitol and polymannitol; heparin or heparan.\n\n\nOther compounds can also be attached to the same polymer, e.g., a cytotoxin, a label, or another targeting agent or an unrelated agent. Mono-activated, alkoxy- terminated polyalkylene oxides (PAO's), e.g., monomethoxy-terminated polyethylene glycols (mPEG's); Ci\n-4\n alkyl-terminated polymers; and bis-activated polyethylene oxides (glycols) can be used for crosslinking. See, e.g., U.S. 5,951,974.\n\n\nMethods Provided herein are methods and compositions for treating subjects with joint pathology and for reducing pain and discomfort associated with such pathology by administering a non-naturally occurring inhibitor of kallikrein to a subject having, or suspected of having, a joint pathology. Examples of such joint pathology include osteoarthritis (primary (idiopathic) or secondary), rheumatoid arthritis, joint injury (e.g., repetitive motion injury), cartilage pathology (chondromalacia), and pre-arthritic states. As used herein, the terms \"treatment\" and \"treating\" refer to improvement of, reduction of the severity of, or stabilization of a symptom of a joint pathology. The methods can be practiced in humans in need of treatment for joint pathology or in nonhuman subjects. In one embodiment, a method for treatment includes administration of a non- naturally occurring polypeptide comprising a Kunitz domain as the inhibitor of pKal. One embodiment of the method uses a polypeptide containing an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 that has an affinity for kallikrein that is approximately 30- fold or more higher than that of a broad range serine protease, e.g., aprotinin, which is isolated from bovine lung and currently approved for use in coronary artery bypass grafting procedures (TRASYLOL™, Bayer Corporation Pharmaceutical Division, West Haven, Conn.).\n\n\nAdministration of the non-naturally occurring pKal inhibitor results in improvement of, a reduction in the severity of, or the stabilization of at least one symptom of a joint pathology, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, joint injury, cartilage pathology, or pre-arthritic states. \n\n Symptoms of joint pathology (e.g., osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, joint injury, cartilage pathology, or pre-arthritic states) include pain, particularly arthralgia, and loss of joint function (e.g., range of motion, grip strength).\n\n\nThe symptoms of a joint pathology may be measured using any appropriate technique or technology. For example, pain may be measured using a pain scale, such as a visual pain scale (VAS). Other useful measures include measures of joint function, such a measurements of range of motion, grip strength, and the like. Other measures that more generally account for overall function, such as measurements of the time the subject is able to maintain a standing position, or time to walk a specified distance are useful. Also useful are questionnaires and other measures of patient function arthritis-related or general performance measures, such as the arthritis impact measurement scale (AIMS), the revised and expanded arthritis impact measurement scales health status questionnaire (AIMS2), health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), Katz index of activities of daily living (KIADL), or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). The therapeutic effect may also be assessed by measuring the improvement in the degree of functional impairment. Functional impairment (and improvement thereof) can be measured by using a segregated, validated multidimensional index (SMI) such as the Western Ontario and McMaster's Universities (WOMAC™) OA index for hip and knee OA or an aggregated multidimensional index (AMI) such as the Algo-Functional Index (AFI) for hip or knee (Lequesne et al. (1987) Scand. J. Rheumatol. Suppl., 65:85-89).\n\n\nCombination Therapy\n\n\nThe non-naturally occurring pKal inhibitor may be administered along with a viscosupplement as part of a combination therapy for joint pathology.\n\n\nThe viscosupplement used in a combination therapy with a pKal inhibitor in accordance with the invention is preferably a hyaluronic acid-based viscosupplement.\n\n\nThe terms \"HA,\" \"hyaluronate,\" \"hyaluronan\" are used interchangeably, and unless stated otherwise, refer to any HA, regardless of the source (bacterially fermented or animal-derived), molecular weight, its physical form (e.g., gel or fluid), or the presence or absence of chemical modifications (e.g., crosslinked or otherwise derivatized), or method of production. \n\n A variety of viscosupplements are in use (although availability varies from country to country). Exemplary viscosupplements comprise a salt of hyaluronic acid (HA), typically sodium hyaluronate, or a derivative thereof, such as a hylan. HA- based viscosupplements include e.g., ORTHOVISC®, Anika Therapeutics, Inc.; OSTENIL®, TRB Chemedica SA; DUROLANE®, Q-Med AB); FERMATHRON™, Biomet; SUPLAS YN™, Bioniche Pharma Group Ltd.; and SYNVISC®, Genzyme Corp. The preparation of hylans and viscosupplements including hylan A and hylan B is described in, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,143,724; 4,713,448; 5,099,013; and 5,399,351. An illustrative viscosupplement used in a combination therapy with a non- naturally occurring pKal inhibitor is hylan G-F 20 (SYNVISC®). SYNVISC® contains 8 + 2 mg/ml HA in two forms: a soluble form, hylan A, (average MW 6,000 kDa) and a hydrated gel form, hylan B 1 in a physiologically acceptable solution. Hylan fluid is hydrated hylan A, a modified form of hyaluronan with a small number of aldehyde-generated crosslinks which increase its average molecular weight and augment its elastoviscous properties. Hylan gel is the hydrated form of hylan B, and is prepared by crosslinking hylan A into a continuous polymeric network, using divinyl sulfone as a bifunctional crosslinking reagent. The hylan A/hylan B ratio in SYNVISC® is 9: 1 by weight of HA. Other products suitable in the methods of the invention include viscosupplements described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5, 143,724; 4,713,448; 5,099,013; 5,399,351 ; 6,521 ,223; and 5,827,937; and U. S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0142152.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the viscosupplement used in a combination therapy in accordance with the invention may be further characterized in that it contains less than about 20 mg/ml HA, e.g., in the range of 1-15, 1-10, 1-5, 5-15, 5-10, 10-15, 6-10, or 7-9 mg/ml. Hyaluronate may be measured using a variety of techniques, including the colorimetric carbazole technique for quantitation of hexuronic acid (Dische et al. (1947) 7. Biol. Chem. 167: 189-198). Viscosupplements may also contain additional active or inactive components including, for example, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, diclofenac, or piroxicam, analgesics such as acetaminophen, anesthetics such as lidocaine or bupivacaine, opioid analgesics such \n\n as codeine or morphine, and/or corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and prednisone; Viscosupplements may also contain components such as cells (e.g., chondrocytes or mesenchymal stem cells), proteins, DNA, vitamins or other desirable biologically active material. Most HA-based viscosupplements are intended to be administered in three to five weekly intraarticular injections (with the exception of DUROLANE®, which is given in a single injection) in a relatively small volume (e.g., 2 ml per injection). However, other dosing schedules, such as the single, high volume (e.g., more than 4 ml, or about 6 ml) injection technique disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0148755 are also useful in the instant methods.\n\n\nCombination therapy with a pKal inhibitor and a viscosupplement may be provided in multiple different configurations. In situations where the pKal inhibitor is to be administered by intraarticular injection, the pKal inhibitor and the viscosupplement may be co-administered as a single composition, or they may be administered by separate injections. In some situations, the pKal inhibitor and the viscosupplement are administered in close temporal proximity (e.g., a short time interval between the injections, such as during the same treatment session), or more widely spaced, depending on the desired schedule of administration for the two components of the combination therapy. When the pKal inhibitor is be administered by systemic (parenteral) administration, the pKal inhibitor and the viscosupplement may be administered in close temporal proximity or more widely spaced, depending on the intended dosing schedule for the two components of the combination therapy.\n\n\nAdministration The pKal inhibitor (alone or as part of a combination therapy) can be administered to a patient before, during, and/or after the onset clinical symptoms of a joint pathology. The patient is generally a human, but may also be a non-human mammal. Human patients include adults, e.g., patients between ages 19-25, 26-40, 41-55, 56-75, and 76 and older, and pediatric patients, e.g., patients between ages 0-2, 3-6, 7-12, and 13-18.\n\n\nThe term \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" composition refers to a non-toxic carrier or excipient that may be administered to a patient, together with a pKal inhibitor described herein. The carrier or excipient is chosen to be compatible with \n\n the biological or pharmacological activity of the composition. The pKal inhibitors (and, in the case of combination therapy, viscosupplement) described herein can be administered locally or systemically by any suitable means for delivery of an inhibitory amount of the inhibitor and/or viscosupplement to a patient including but not limited to systemic administrations such as, for example, intravenous and inhalation. Parenteral administration is particularly preferred for the pKal inhibitor.\n\n\nFor parenteral administration, the pKal inhibitor can be injected intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or subcutaneously. Subcutaneous injection and i.v. administration are preferred routes for parenteral administration. Also useful is local (intraarticular) injection, particularly when the involved joints are medium to large joints (e.g., hip, knee, elbow, ankle, wrist).\n\n\nTypically, compositions for administration by injection are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer (e.g., sodium/potassium phosphate buffered saline). Other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, sterile water, saline solution, and buffered saline (including buffers like phosphate or acetate), alcohol, vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, paraffin, etc. Where necessary, the composition can also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lidocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts, lubricants, etc. as long as they do not react deleteriously with the active compounds. Similarly, the composition can comprise conventional excipients, e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable for parenteral, enteral or intranasal application which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds. Generally, the ingredients will be supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule, sachette, or vial indicating the quantity of active agent in activity units. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade \"water for injection\" or saline. Where the composition is to be administered by injection, a container (e.g., ampoule or vial) of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration. \n\n Exemplary formulations for subcutaneous administration of non-naturally occurring pKal inhibitors include buffered solutions containing a buffering agent (e.g., histidine or phosphate buffer) and a cryoprotectant (e.g., sucrose or sucrose and mannitol, optionally including a dextran such as dextran 40), and may be lyophilized for storage and distribution as described in U.S. Serial No. 11/716,278, filed March 9, 2007.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the pKal inhibitor is administered to a patient as an intravenous infusion according to any approved procedure. In another embodiment, the pKal inhibitor is administered to a patient as a subcutaneous bolus. In another embodiment, the pKal inhibitor is administered to a patient by intraarticular injection into the affected joint(s). LV. and intraarticular administration are typically carried out by a health care professional in a clinical setting (e.g., hospital, urgent care, or doctor' s office), but subcutaneous injections may be self-administered or administered by a health care professional. Parameters that can be evaluated for determining a dose of the kallikrein inhibitor for systemic administration, are described below with regards to DX-88 (a non-naturally occurring kallikrein inhibitor, SEQ ID NO:2). The total amount of circulating prekallikrein in plasma is reported to be approximately 500 nM to 600 nM (Silverberg et al., \"The Contact System and Its Disorders,\" in Blood: Principles and Practice of Hematology, Handin, R. et al., eds, J B Lippincott Co., Philadelphia,\n\n\n1995). If all prekallikrein is activated, about 520 nmoles/L of DX-88 can be used to inhibit kallikrein in a stoichiometric manner. An individual having 5 L of plasma would require a dose of 2.6 micromoles DX-88, or approximately 18 mg based on the molecular weight of DX-88 of 7,054 Dal tons. This was calculated as follows: the K, of DX88 is 0.044 nM. When it is desired to have a concentration of plasma kallikrein (PK) of, e.g., InM, the formula K, = 0.044nM =[DX88] x [PK]/[DX88-PK] = [DX88] x 1 nm/499 nM, indicates that the concentration of free DX-88 is 22.0 nM. Thus, the total amount of DX-88 needed would be 499 + 22 or 521 nM. The dose can be reduced proportionally if not all of the prekallikrein is activated or if a portion of the kallikrein is deactivated by an endogenous inhibitor, e.g., Cl esterase inhibitor\n\n\n(ClINH). Thus, in certain embodiments, about 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60,80, 120, 250, 500, 600, 700, 800, 1000 mg of DX-88 can be administered to a subject, in a single dose or in one or more doses spread over a twenty-four hour period. Consideration \n\n of several other factors may provide a more accurate estimation of the dose of DX-88 required in practice, such as patient age, weight, and severity of the joint pathology and associated symptoms.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the kallikrein inhibitor polypeptide is administered in a dose of about 1-500 mg/m\n2\n, preferably about 1-250 mg/m\n2\n, 1-100 mg/m\n2\n.\n\n\nDevices and Kits\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions that include the kallikrein inhibitor can be administered with a medical device. The device can designed with features such as portability, room temperature storage, and ease of use so that it can be used in settings outside of a hospital or emergency room/urgent care facility (e.g., by the patient or a caregiver in the home or in a doctor's office). The device can include, e.g., one or more housings for storing pharmaceutical preparations that include a non-naturally occurring kallikrein inhibitor, and can be configured to deliver one or more unit doses of the agent or agents.\n\n\nI.

Description\n\n\n\n\n COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR TREATING INFLAMMATION AND INFLAMMATION-RELATED DISORDERS BY PLECTRANTHUS\n\n\nAMBOiNicus EXTRACTS\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATION\n\n\n[0001] The present disclosure incorporates by reference and claims the Paris Convention Priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/973,164, filed September 17, 2007.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n[0002] Plectranthus amboinicus (PA) is a traditional Chinese medicine used for coughs, sore throats, and nasal congestion, but also for a range of other problems such as infections, rheumatism, and flatulence. Although the chemical constituents of PA have been extensively studied, its active ingredients for inhibition of AP-i binding have not been reported.\n\n\n[0003] The transcription factor activator protein-i (AP-i) regulates expression of various genes by binding to a consensus DNA recognition sequence TGA(C/G)TCA also known as a TPA responsive element (TRE) in the promoter region of target genes. In mammalian cells, AP-i complexes are mainly formed by members of Fos and Jun-related proteins. AP-i proteins contain a characteristic amino acid sequence called the bZIP domain. This domain is bipartite; it contains helical conformation and serves as a dimerization interfaces. Interactions between two leucine repeats juxtapose the N-terminal basic regions of two bZIP domains to form a DNA-binding-competent dimer. In vitro studies indicated that stable heterodimer can form between one member of the Fos family and one of Jun class. Jun homodimer can be formed in vitro; yet they are unstable in physiological conditions. Fos homodimer has not been found in normal experimental conditions. In vitro binding and transcription studies indicate that Fos-Jun heterodimer is the predominant active species of AP-i proteins. \n\n [0004] AP-i activation followed by increased expression of certain genes is a regulator of final steps in a wide range of cellular processes, such as inflammation, stress response, cell differentiation, and tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting the formation of the AP-i— DNA complex is an approach for reducing inflammation and cancer progression. AP-I activities have been implicated in several autoimmune diseases such as colitis, lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n[0005] Generally, inflammation signaling pathways leads to the activation of several transcription factors including AP-i, which then activate immune cells and induce differentiation of specific cells. A markedly increased expression and high DNA binding activity of AP-i is found in rheumatoid arthritis synovium. In addition, overexpression of c-fos caused overgrowth of synovial cells and arthritic joint destruction. These observations have led to hypothesize that modulating DNA binding activities of AP-i may reduce the progression of inflammation in diseases. In fact, the administration of decoy AP-i oligonucleotides has been shown to reduce collagen-induced arthritis and to attenuate intenstinal inflammation in murine experimental colitis.\n\n\n[0006] Based on these observations, efforts have been made in development of AP-i inhibitors for inflammatory diseases and cancer. Curcumin, a powerful inhibitor of AP-i binding activities, has been shown to have anti-cancer activities and can suppress osteoclastogenesis and stimulate osteoclast apoptosis. Momordin I, a strong inhibitor for Jun/Fos dimer formation and the AP-i-DNA binding, can inhibit cancer cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis.\n\n\n[0007] Inflammation has a broad spectrum involvement in many human acute and chronic diseases including allergies, arthritis, gingivitis and most of \"-itis\" diseases. Inflammation usually starts with tissue injury and subsequent attraction of immune cells to the injured regions to promote healing. Inflammation protects the body, however, it also damages the body if the inflammatory response is unbalanced and outweighs the threat it is dealing with. The anti-inflammatory drugs can be potentially used for autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), allergy, cancer, heart disease, and arthrosclerosis. RA is an inflammatory disease mediated by enhanced T-cell activity and is characterized by synovitis and erosion of periarticular bone and joint destruction due \n\n to excessive subchondral osteoclastic resorption. Therapeutic management of RA has focused on the development of anti-inflammatory drugs that block cytokine signaling. Current treatments are NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), corticosteroids, and DMARDs (Disease Modifying Antirheumatoid Drugs) such as methotrexate, TNF inhibitors, and Actemra (tocilizumab), a humanized anti-human interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor monoclonal antibody.\n\n\n[0008] Inflammation is a response of a tissue to injury. It attracts immune cells for healing via regulation of a variety of different cytokines, which are predominantly activated by the transcription factors of the NF-κB, AP-I, and NFAT, and STAT families. Activator protein-i (AP-i) is a transcriptional factor that is activated during the cell cycle to promote cell survival, differentiation and adaptive responses. It was recently shown that AP-i activity is involved in inflammation signaling, suggesting AP-I may be a new target to intervene inflammation-related diseases.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\n[0009] The crude extract of Plectranthus Amboinicus (PA) has anti-inflammatory effects and can inhibit AP-I binding in vitro. The incubation with PA crude extract resulted in significant inhibition of the LPS-induced expression of IL-6, IL-12, MCP-I, and RANTES in HUVEC cells. After the crude extract was further fractionated using preparative HPLC, fraction 8, 9, 10 and 11 were identified to inhibit the AP-I binding activity. The active component of fraction 8 is Mena 987; fraction 9 is Mena 998; fraction IO is Mena 9102; and fraction 11 is rosmarinic acid and the synthestic rosmarmic acid analogues. Other compounds showed inhibitory activities as well. These compounds have inhibitory effects on AP- 1 activity and are useful as preventive or therapeutic agent for diseases in which excessive expression or activities of AP-i are involved.\n\n\n[0010] According to features of the present disclosure, a composition is disclosed comprising an extract of Plectranthus amboinicus and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n[0011] According to features of the present disclosure, a method is disclosed comprising providing a composition containing at least a Plectranthus amboinicus \n\n extract and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for administration in a therapeutically effective amount to a patient in need thereof.\n\n\n[0012] According to features of the present disclosure, a method is disclosed comprising preparing a recombinant Fos-Jun complex, wherein the Fos-Jun complex is produced from a vector having a Fos gene and a Jun gene, and a first tag gene associated with the Fos gene and a second tag gene associated with the His gene, wherein the first tag gene is different from the second tag gene; screening for the Fos-Jun complexes by performing a first screening of the gene products of the vector with one tag to produce a partially screened gene product set; and screening the partially screened gene product set with the other tag to isolate the Fos-Jun complexes.\n\n\n[0013] A method is disclosed for treating inflammation or an inflammation-related disorder.

The inhibition of IL-6, IL-12, MCP-i, and RANTES plays at least an anti-inflammatory role. \n\n [0049] In some exemplary implementations, the Plectranthus amboinicus extract inhibits AP-I binding activity. The inhibition of AP-I binding activity plays a role in the prevention and therapy of diseases associated with excessive expression or activity of AP-i, for example, inflammatory diseases and immunological diseases.\n\n\n[0050] In an aspect of the present disclosure, a method is provided for treating inflammation and inflammation-related disorders. The method comprises the steps of filtering Plectranthus amboinicus extract into at least one fraction, providing a composition having at least one of the Plectranthus amboinicus extract fractions, and administering a therapeutically effective amount of the composition to a patient in need thereof.\n\n\n[0051] In another aspect of the present disclosure, a composition is provided for treating inflammation and inflammation-related disorders. The composition comprises at least one fraction of a Plectranthus amboinicus extract.\n\n\n[0052] In exemplary implementations, the Plectranthus amboinicus extract fraction inhibits at least one of an IL-6, IL-12, MCP-I, and RANTES expression. In some exemplary implementations, the Plectranthus amboinicus extract fraction inhibits AP-i binding activity.\n\n\n[0053] The term \"fraction\" refers to one of the separable constituents of a substance. The fractions are collected based on differences in a specific property of the individual constituents. In exemplary implementations, the fractions are identified by their optical absorbance at a specific wavelength.\n\n\n[0054] The term \"filtering\" refers to any procedure used to separate a constituent of a substance from other constituents of the substance. Various methods and procedures for filtration are known and used by those skilled in the art. Such methods and procedures include dialysis, gel filtration chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In one example, Plectranthus amboinicus extract is filtered using a C-18 column.\n\n\n[0055] The process of filtering may be repeated multiple times, where one or more of the fractions collected may be further filtered to generate additional fractions. In \n\n exemplary implementations, a filtered fraction of a Plectranthus amboinicus extract is filtered again into more fractions to further separate the constituents of the Plectranthus amboinicus extract. In one example, a filtered fraction is filtered with a C-18 column using a solvent gradient from 2% acetonitrile to 90% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.\n\n\n[0056] In exemplary implementations of the present disclosure, a Plectranthus amboinicus extract fraction, herein referred to as \"F10\" or \"Fraction 10,\" contains a CisHiyNoβ compound, herein also referred to as \"CHM9102/' of the general structure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0057] According to implementations, a method is provided for treating inflammation and inflammation-related disorders. The method comprises the steps of providing a composition comprising a compound of the general structure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0058] and administering a therapeutically effective amount of the composition to a patient in need thereof.\n\n\n[0059] According to implementations, a composition is provided for treating inflammation and inflammation-related disorders. The composition comprises a compound of the general structure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0060] In exemplary implementations, the CHM9102 compound inhibits at least one of an IL-6, IL-12, MCP-i, and RANTES expression. In some exemplary implementations, CHM9102 inhibits AP-i binding activity. \n\n [ooόi] According to exemplary implementations, a composition may be in various forms including powders, creams, gels, salves, ointments, solutions, tablets, capsules, sprays, and patches. Vehicles and carriers may be used for delivery of the composition to the patient. Such carriers include solubilizing agents, diluents, and dispersion media. These carriers are biocompatible, pharmaceutically acceptable, and do not alter the treatment characteristics of the Plectranthus amboinieus extract or the CHM9102 compound. Excipients, adjuvants and other ingredients may also be included in the composition.\n\n\n[0062] The composition should be stable during manufacture and storage. The Plectranthus amboinieus extract or the CHM9102 compound may be encapsulated, with agents such as aluminum monostearate, gelatin, and biodegradable and biocompatible polymers, to prevent undesired degradation in the body or by other ingredients in the composition. Anti-bacteria and anti-fungal agents such as benzyl alcohols, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, and thimerosal may also be included in the composition.\n\n\n[0063] Administration of the composition may be achieved through various methods to different parts of the body, including intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (i.e., topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration.\n\n\n[0064] In exemplary implementations, the composition is a solution or suspension injected parenterally, intradermally, or subcutaneously. Carriers include water, saline solutions, and other synthetic solvents. Buffers such as acetates, citrates, and phosphates may be used, as well agents for adjusting tonicity, such as sodium chloride and dextrose, and agents for adjusting pH, such as hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide.\n\n\n[0065] In other exemplary implementations, the composition is a dietary supplement. Dietary supplements may be prepared in various forms, including solid, liquid, and powder forms. The composition may be taken independently as a pill, tablet, or encapsulated gel, or as a food additive, beverage, or mixable powder.\n\n\n[0066] The phrase \"therapeutically effective amount\" refers to an amount that produces some desired \np\nffeπt at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical \n\n treatment. The effective amount may vary depending on such factors as the disease or condition being treated, the particular targeted constructs being administered, the size of the subject, or the severity of the disease or condition. One of ordinary skill in the art may empirically determine the effective amount of a particular compound without necessitating undue experimentation.\n\n\n[0067] According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a CHM9102 analog may be used instead of CHM9102 for treating inflammation and inflammation-related disorders. In exemplary implementations, a CHM9102 analog, herein referred to as \"rosmarinic acid,\" may be used instead of CHM9102. The rosmarinic acid has the general structure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0068] According to implementations, a method is provided for treating inflammation and inflammation-related disorders. The method comprises the steps of providing a composition comprising a compound of the general structure:\n\n\n \n\n and administering a therapeutically effective amount of the composition to a patient in need thereof.\n\n\n[0069] According to implementations, a composition is provided for treating inflammation and inflammation-related disorders. The composition comprises a compound of the general structure: \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n[0070] In exemplary implementations, the rosmarinic acid compound inhibits at least one of an IL-6, IL-12, MCP-i, and RANTES expression. In some exemplary implementations, rosmarinic acid inhibits AP-i binding activity.\n\n\n[0071] As discussed, Plectranthus Amboinics has AP-i inhibition activity, as shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, the Plectranthus Amboinics extract and its active ingredients (alone or in combination) are useful for treating inflammation-related diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and others.\n\n\n[0072] According to implementations of experimental data shown in Fig. 5, oligonucleotide containing AP-i binding sites were incubated nuclear extracts from TPA-stimulated K562 (K562) or HeLa (HeLa) cells. The antibodies to AP-I complexes were added followed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody for ELISA-based analysis. AP-i binding activity in the nuclear extract from TPA-stimulated cells was defined as 100% and the AP-I binding activity of buffer only was defined as 0%. Data showed PA extract can inhibit AP-I binding activities.\n\n\n[0073] According to an implementation, AP-i complexes can be formed, but not limited, by C-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra-i or Fra-2. As shown in Fig. 6, the binding activities of AP-i complexes formed by the indicated proteins were decreased in the presence of Plectranthus amboinics extracts.\n\n\n[0074] According to implementations of experimental data shown in Fig. 6, AP-I complexes can be formed by different proteins such as C-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra-i or Fra-2. Various antibodies were used in ELISA-based analysis to demonstrate the target protein for PA extract. Results showed that PA extract can inhibit DNA-binding activities of the complexes formed by C-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra-i or Fra-2.\n\n\n[0075] Thus, rosmarinic acid, Mena 987, Mena 998, Mena 9102 are present in a Plectranthus amboinics extract which has AP-i inhibition activity. According to \n\n implementations, the Plectranthus amboinics extract are useful for treating rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammation-related diseases when used in pharmaceutical or nutraceutical compositions.\n\n\n[0076] According to implementations, Plectranthus amboinics extracts contain 0.5-1.2% (e.g., 0.89%) by weight rosmarinic acid, 0.05-0.1% (e.g., 0.06%) by weight Mena 987, 0.05-0.1% (e.g., 0.09%) by weight Mena 998, and 0.05-0.1% (e.g., 0.08%) by weight Mena 9102. The percentage of polyphenols in the extract may be at least 30% (i.e., any integer percentage between 30% and 100%, inclusive) by weight, as determined using the hide powder method, which has been the official method for polyphenol analysis (American Leather Chemist Association). The amount of polyphenols is determined by preparation of polyphenols solutions, absorption of the polyphenols on chromated fide powder, and subsequent determination of residual materials by gravimetric analysis.\n\n\n[0077] According to implementations, the extract is prepared according to the methods described in Examples below or by equivalent methods. For example, the crude leaf juice is centrifuged at IOOOOX g for 30 min, and the supernatant is filtered. The filtrate is lyophilized to yield a dry powder. Then power is purified by RPCis-HPLC. According to the elution profile and implementations, four fractions were collected by a model CHF122SB Advantec fraction collector. Frac #8 (contained Mena 987) was collected from 19.5 to 21.5 min, Frac #9 (contained Mena 998) was collected from 21.5 to 23.5 min, Frac #10 (contained rosmarinic acid and Mena 9102) was collected from 23.5 to 25.5 min According to implementations, 1 g Plectranthus amboinics dry powder can yields 4.8 mg Frac#8, 14 mg Frac#9 and 12.7 mg Frac#io.\n\n\n[0078] According to implementations, a pharmaceutical composition Mena 987 is disclosed comprising a therapeutically effective amount of: \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n[0079] According to implementations, a composition Mena 998 is disclosed comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of: \n\n\n\n\n\n[0080] According to implementations, a composition Mena 9102 is disclosed comprising a therapeutically effective amount of: \n\n\n\n\n\n[0081] According to implementations, a composition rosmarinic acid is disclosed comprising a therapeutically effective amount of: \n\n\n \n\n [oo82] As the biological functions of rosmarinic acid, Mena 987, Mena 998, and Mena 9102 differ, the proportion of each ingredient in the PA extract may be adjusted as needed. For improved bioactivity, some analogues may be synthesized artificially.\n\n\n[0083] According to implementations, a composition is disclosed comprising an inhibition of AP-I with an effective amount of formula I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere Ar\n1\n and Ar\n2\n are independently selected from phenyl, mono-, di- and multi-substituents phenyl, for example, (HO)\nn\n, (H\n3\nCO)\nn\n where n = 1-3, methylenedioxy (OCH\n2\nO), CH\n3\n, F, Cl\n3\n Br, I, NHR (R = H, OCOCH\n3\n), NO\n2\n, and COOR; where R is H or alkyl, and RCO, where R is H or alkyl; A is independently selected from H, COOR, CONRR\n'\n, SO\n3\nH, SO\n2\nNRR\n'\n, or PO(OR)(OR'), where R and R are independently selected from H, C1-C6 alkyl, or aryl; and where X is CH\n2\n, O, or NH.\n\n\n[0084] According to implementations, a composition is disclosed comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one of the compounds of Table 1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAr\n1\n X A Ar\n2\n \n\n\n3,4-dihrdroxy phenyl NH COOMe 3,4-dihrdroxy phenyl (5)\n\n\n3,4-dihrdroxy phenyl NH COOEt 3,4-dihrdroxy phenyl (6)\n\n\n3,4-dihrdroxy phenyl NH COOH 3,4-dihrdroxy phenyl (7)\n\n\n3,4-dihrdroxy phenyl NH H 3,4-dihrdroxy phenyl (8)\n\n\n3,4-dihrdroxy phenyl NH PO(OEt)\n2\n 3,4-dihrdroxy phenyl (9)\n\n\n3,4-dihrdroxy phenyl O COOEt 3,4-dihrdroxy phenyl (10) \n\n 3,4-dϊhrdroxy-6-nitro- O COOH 3,4-dihrdroxy-6-nitro\n\n\nP\nhen\n^ phenyl (11)\n\n\n3,4-dihrdroxy-6-nitro- O COOH 3,4-dihrdroxy-6-nitro- p \nF\nheny \n3\nl p iheny \nλ\nl ( ,12 \nΛ\n)\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\n[0085] According to implementations, a composition is disclosed comprising a therapeutically effective amount of formula II.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0086] Where Ar\n1\n and Ar\n2\n are independently selected from phenyl, mono-, di- and multi-substituents phenyl, for example, (HO)\nn\n, (H\n3\nCO)\nn\n where n = 1-3, methylenedioxy (OCH\n2\nO), CH\n3\n, F, Cl, Br, I, NHR (R = H, OCOCH\n3\n), NO\n2\n, COOR where R is H or alkyl, and RCO where R is H or alkyl, X is CH\n2\n, O, NH.

The results of the AP-i inhibition assay results are shown in Table 3,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3\n\n\n[0089] According to implementations, binding assays were developed to identify inhibitors that block the AP-I DNA binding activities. Traditional methods call for the preparation of nuclear extracts from TPA-stimulated cells, or require separate purification of Fos and Jun followed with in vitro dimerization to form a functional AP- 1 complexes. A bicistronic expression vector that can drive the expression of two genes in one plasmid was thus designed as shown in Fig. 7. In this system, a promoter would directly drive the expression of the first gene, which is connected to the second gene via a \n\n ribosome-binding site in order to confer the expression of the second genes. Any pair of genes that form heterodimer in the cells for their physiological functions can be potentially expressed as complexes in the cells using this system.\n\n\n[0090] According to implementations, the expression system of Fig. 7 was used to co-express AP-i complexes. Accordingly, Fos (as gene 1) was tagged with a (Histidine)6 tag and Jun (as Gene 2) was tagged with Strep-tag as illustrated in Fig. 8A. The results demonstrated that complexes containing both his-tagged and strep-tagged protein are purified with Ni\n2+\n chromatography using a single step (Fig. 8B). Cross-linking experiments further confirmed the Fos- Jun complexes are dimers (Fig. 8C).\n\n\n[0091] According to implementations of experimental data shown in Fig 8, a construct for Bi-cistronic expression of Fos and Jun in a single vector, such as a plasmid, was created as shown in Fig. 8A. In Fig. 8B, purification of recombinant Fos-Jun complexes was accomplished. Bacterial cells harboring pFos-Jun were induced for recombinant protein expression. After cell lysis, the cell crude extracts were passed through Ni\n2+\n column followed with imidazole elution to release (Histidine)ό-contaimng complexes. As shown in Fig. 8B, lane M is a protein marker; lane 1 is a cell crude extract; lane 2 is flow-through from Ni\n2+\n column; lane 3 is a wash with 10 mM imidazole; and lane 4 is elution with 500 mM imidazole.\n\n\n[0092] The crude extracts containing or the purified proteins were used for ELISA-based and fluorescence anisotropy-based binding analysis. Labeled oligonucleotides containing one or more copies of AP- 1 consensus binding sites were used in the binding assays. Biotin-labeled oligonucleotides were used to coat streptavidin-plates in ELISA-binding assays. Rhodamine or fluorescein or other fluorophores-labeled oligonucleotides were used for fluorescence anisotropy analysis.\n\n\n[0093] As shown in Fig. 9, the results confirmed that the DNA binding activities of recombinant AP-I complexes were specific as potent competitors, as free unlabeled oligonucleotides containing AP-i consensus binding sites block the binding between labeled DNA and the AP-i complexes using both ELISA- and fluorescence anisotropy-based binding assays. According to implementations shown in Fig. 9, development of ELISA-based (Figs. 9A and 9B) and fluorescence anisotropy-based (Figs. \n\n <jC and 9D) assays for AP-I DNA binding activities. Figs 9A and 9C show concentration-dependent increase in AP-I binding activities. Figs. 9B and 9D show dose-dependent inhibition by free AP-i-binding site-containing oligonucleotides.\n\n\n[0094] According to implementations, the compounds of the present disclosure can be included in a pharmaceutical or nutraceutical composition together with additional active agents, carriers, vehicles, excipients, or auxiliary agents identifiable by a person skilled in the art upon reading of the present disclosure and administered to at least the eye of an animal, such as human.\n\n\n[0095] The pharmaceutical or nutraceutical compositions preferably comprise at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In such pharmaceutical compositions, the agents of the present disclosure are the \"active compound,\" also referred to as the \"active agent.\" As used herein the language \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" includes solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. A pharmaceutical composition is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol, or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates, or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes, or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.\n\n\n[0096] Subject as used herein refers to humans and non-human primates (e.g., guerilla, macaque, marmoset), livestock animals (e.g., sheep, cow, horse, donkey, and pig), \n\n companion animals (e.g., dog, cat), laboratory test animals (e.g., mouse, rabbit, rat, guinea pig, hamster), captive wild animals (e.g., fox, deer), and any other organisms who can benefit from the agents of the present disclosure. There is no limitation on the type of animal that could benefit from the presently described agents. A subject regardless of whether it is a human or non-human organism may be referred to as a patient, individual, animal, host, or recipient.\n\n\n[0097] Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for an injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water-soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administ ration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL.TM. (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.), or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition should be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n[0098] Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile \n,\n~-a\n,\n^\ni\n~ \n,\n.\n4\n^\n,,U\n - — \n4\n-\nΛ\n \nJ\n — ^ basic dispersion medium and the reαuired other inεredients \n\n from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, methods of preparation include vacuum drying and freeze-drying, which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.\n\n\n[0099] Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.\n\n\n[00100] For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer.\n\n\n[00101] Systemic administration can also be transmucosal or transdermal. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration may be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery. \n\n [ooiO2] According to implementations, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to cell-specific antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811, which is incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\n[00103] It is advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.\n\n\n[00104] Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds may be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects can be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected location to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.\n\n\n[00105] The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little \n\n or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the disclosure, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.\n\n\n[00106] As defined herein, a therapeutically effective amount of the active compound (i.e., an effective dosage) may range from about 0.001 to 100 g/kg body weight, or other ranges that would be apparent and understood by artisans without undue experimentation. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors can influence the dosage and timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health or age of the subject, and other diseases present.\n\n\n[00107] According to another aspect, one or more kits of parts can be envisioned by the person skilled in the art, the kits of parts to perform at least one of the methods herein disclosed, the kit of parts comprising two or more compositions, the compositions comprising alone or in combination an effective amount of the agents of the present disclosure according to the at least one of the above mentioned methods.\n\n\n[00108] The kits possibly include also compositions comprising active agents other than the compounds of the present disclosure, identifiers of a biological event, or other compounds identifiable by a person skilled upon reading of the present disclosure. The term \" identifier\" refers to a molecule, metabolite or other compound, such as antibodies, DNA or RNA oligonucleotides, able to discover or determine the existence, presence, or fact of or otherwise detect a biological event under procedures identifiable by a person skilled in the art; exemplary identifiers are antibodies, exemplary procedures are western blot, nitrite assay and RT-PCR, or other procedures as described in the Examples. Exemplary biological events are cytokine expression or other immunomodulating events. \n\n [00109] The kit can also comprise at least one composition comprising an effective amount the compounds of the present disclosure or a cell line. The compositions and the cell line of the kits of parts to be used to perform the at least one method herein disclosed according to procedure identifiable by a person skilled in the art.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n[00110] A more complete understanding of the present disclosure can be obtained by reference to the following specific examples and figures. The examples and figures are described solely for purposes of illustration and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure. Changes in form and substitution of equivalents are contemplated as circumstances may suggest or render expedient.

Human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC) cells were incubated with LPS in the absence or presence of 1 mg/ml crude extract of PA. The cytokine expression profile was determined using Luminex. Results showed that the crude extract of PA can significantly reduce the expression of the cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, MCP-i, and RANTES.\n\n\nTable 1. Effects of PA extract on the LPS-induced expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Inhibition of AP- 1 Binding Activities with PA extract.\n\n\n[00112] Due to the involvement of AP- 1 activity in inflammatory signaling, the effects of the PA crude extract on AP-i/DNA binding activity was examined. Shown in Figure 1, an ELISA-based assay was used to determine the inhibitory effects of the PA crude extract on DNA binding activity of AP-i transcription factors. The nuclear extract prepared from TPA-activated HeLa or K562 cells were used as AP-i protein sources. After incubating with the oligonucleotides containing AP-i binding sites, the AP-i/DNA complexes were detected with HRP-conjugated anti-c-Fos antibodies. It was found that\n\n\n[00113] the DNA binding activity of AP-i in vitro was inhibited by the PA crude extract and the effects were dose-dependent.\n\n\nExample g: Inhibition of AP-i Binding Activities with Fraction 10, CHM9102, and Rosmarinic Acid.\n\n\n[00114] The PA crude extract was further fractionated with preparative HPLC using C18 column. As shown in Figure 2, the crude extract of Plectranthus amboinicus was separated into 16 fractions. Fraction 10 showed inhibitory effects against AP-i binding. This fraction was further purified by employing another C18 column using the solvent gradient from 2% acetonitrile to 90% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoreoacetic \n\n acid. The major peak was collected and then subjected for structural determination by MASS and NMR analysis, shown in Figure 3. These studies resulted in the deduction of the structure of the active component, CHM9102. rosraarinic acid, an analog of the CHM9102, was also tested for AP-I inhibitory activities.\n\n\n[ooii5]While the method and agent have been described in terms of what are presently considered to be the most practical and preferred implementations, it is to be understood that the disclosure need not be limited to the disclosed exemplary implementations.

The crude leaf juice was centrifuged with a model Beckman centrifugator at io,ooox g for 30 min at 4 \n0\nC. The clear supernatant recovered from crude leaf juice was further filtered through N0.1 filter paper (125 mm, Advantec, lot no. 60821017) to remove the impurities and leaf debris. The filtrate was then lyophilized and the dry powder was stored at room \n\n temperature till RPCis-HPLC fractionation.

These samples were initially separated on a Discovery BIO Wide Pore Cis reversed-phase column (5 μm, 25 cm x 10 mm, Supelco) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min with an injection volume of 100 μl. A linear gradient from solvent A (98% water, 2% acetonitrile, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to solvent B (90% acetonitrile, 10% water, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in 60 min was used for separation. The column was re-equilibrated with 100% solvent A for 20 min prior to each injection. The products purified by RPCiβ-HPLC were lyophilized to remove the mobile phase and then stored at room temperature before further separation. According to the elution profile, 3 fractions were collected by a model CHF122SB Advantec fraction collector. Frac#8 was collected from 19.5 to 21.5 min, Frac#9 was collected from 21.5 to 23.5 min and Frac#io was collected from 23.5 to 25.5 min. Generally, 1 g Plectranthus amboinics dry powder can yields 4.8 mg Frac#8, 14 mg Frac#9 and 12.7 mg Frac#io.\n\n\n[00147] While the compositions and methods have been described in terms of what are presently considered to be the most practical and preferred implementations, it is to be understood that the disclosure need not be limited to the disclosed implementations.

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. It discloses the use of the protein S100A12 (=Calgranulin C) as a marker molecule in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Furthermore, it especially relates to a method for diagnosis of colorectal cancer from a stool sample, derived from an individual by measuring S100A12 in said sample. Measurement of S100A12 can, e.g., be used in the early detection or diagnosis of colorectal cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancer remains a major public health challenge despite progress in detection and therapy. Amongst the various types of cancer, colorectal cancer (=CRC) is one of the most frequent cancers in the Western world.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe earlier cancer can be detected/diagnosed, the better is the overall survival rate. This is especially true for CRC. The prognosis in advanced stages of tumor is poor. More than one third of the patients will die from progressive disease within five years after diagnosis, corresponding to a survival rate of about 40% for five years. Current treatment is only curing a fraction of the patients and clearly has the best effect on those patients diagnosed in an early stage of disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to CRC as a public health problem, it is essential that more effective screening and preventative measures for colorectal cancer be developed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe earliest detection procedures available at present for colorectal cancer involve using tests for fecal blood or endoscopic procedures. However, significant tumor size must typically exist before fecal blood is detected. With regard to detection of CRC from a stool sample, the current state of the art is the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the recent years a tremendous amount of so-called colon specific or even so-called colorectal cancer specific genes has been reported. The vast majority of the corresponding research papers or patent applications are based on data obtained by analysis of RNA expression patterns in colon (cancer) tissue versus a different tissue or an adjacent normal tissue, respectively. Such approaches may be summarized as differential mRNA display techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs an example for data available from mRNA-display techniques, \n \nWO 01/96390\n \n shall be mentioned and discussed. This application describes and claims more than two hundred isolated polynucleotides and the corresponding polypeptides as such, as well as their use in the detection of CRC. However, it is general knowledge that differences on the level of mRNA are not mirrored by the level of the corresponding proteins. A protein encoded by a rare mRNA may be found in very high amounts and a protein encoded by an abundant mRNA may nonetheless be hard to detect and find at all. This lack of correlation between mRNA-level and protein level is due to reasons like mRNA stability, efficiency of translation, stability of the protein, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere also are recent approaches investigating the differences in protein patterns between different tissues or between healthy and diseased tissue in order to identify candidate marker molecules which might be used in the diagnosis of CRC. \nBrünagel, G. et al., Cancer Research 62 (2002) 2437-2442\n, have identified seven nuclear matrix proteins which appear to be more abundant in CRC tissue as compared to adjacent normal tissue. No data from liquid and stool samples obtained from an individual are reported.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO 02/078636\n \n reports about nine colorectal cancer-associated spots as found by surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization (SELDI). These spots are seen more frequently in sera obtained from patients with CRC as compared to sera obtained from healthy controls. However, the identity of the molecule(s) comprised in such spot, e.g., its (their sequence), is not known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite the large and ever growing list of candidate protein markers in the field of CRC, to date clinical/diagnostic utility of these molecules is not known. In order to be of clinical utility a new diagnostic marker as a single marker should be at least as good as the best single marker known in the art. Or, a new marker should lead to a progress in diagnostic sensitivity and/or specificity either if used alone or in combination with one or more other markers, respectively. The diagnostic sensitivity and/or specificity of a test is often assessed by its receiver-operating characteristics, which will be described in detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt present, for example, diagnostic blood tests based on the detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a tumor-associated glycoprotein, are available to assist diagnosis in the field of CRC. CEA is increased in 95% of tissue samples obtained from patients with colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancers and in the majority of breast, lung, and head and neck carcinomas (\nGoldenberg, D.M. et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. (Bethesda) 57 (1976) 11-22\n). Elevated CEA levels have also been reported in patients with nonmalignant disease, and many patients with colorectal cancer have normal CEA levels in the serum, especially during the early stage of the disease (\nCarriquiry, L.A. and Pineyro, A., Dis. Colon Rectum 42 (1999) 921-929\n; \nHerrera, M.A. et al., Ann. Surg. 183 (1976) 5-9\n; \nWanebo, H.J. et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 299 (1978) 448-451\n). The utility of CEA as measured from serum or plasma in detecting recurrences is reportedly controversial and has yet to be widely applied (\nMartell, R.E. et al., Int. J. Biol. Markers 13 (1998) 145-149\n; \nMoertel, C.G. et al., JAMA 270 (1993) 943-947\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn light of the available data, serum CEA determination possesses neither the sensitivity nor the specificity to enable its use as a screening test for colorectal cancer in the asymptomatic population (\nReynoso, G. et al., JAMA 220 (1972) 361-365\n; \nSturgeon, C., Clin. Chem. 48 (2002) 1151-1159\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples taken from stool have the advantage that their sampling is easily possible by non-invasive means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, the guaiac test is currently most widely used as a screening assay for CRC from stool. The guaiac test, however, has both poor sensitivity as well as poor specificity. The sensitivity of the guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests is ∼26%, which means 74% of patients with malignant lesions will remain undetected (\nAhlquist, D.A., Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 26 (1997) 41-55\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe visualization of precancerous and cancerous lesions represents the best approach to early detection, but colonoscopy is invasive with significant costs, risks, and complications (\nSilvis, S.E. et al., JAMA 235 (1976) 928-930\n; \nGeenen, J.E. et al., Am. J. Dig. Dis. 20 (1975) 231-235\n; \nAnderson, W.F. et al., J. Natl. Cancer Institute 94 (2002) 1126-1133\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic alternatives to the guaiac test have been recently investigated by \nSieg, A. et al., Int. J. Colorectal Dis. 14 (1999) 267-271\n. Especially the measurement of hemoglobin and of the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex from stool specimen have been compared. It has been noted that the hemoglobin assay has an unsatisfactory sensitivity for the detection of colorectal neoplasms. Whereas cancer in its progressed carcinoma stage is detected with a sensitivity of about 87% the earlier tumor stages are not detected with a sufficient sensitivity. The hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex assay was more sensitive in the detection of earlier stages of CRC. This more sensitive detection was accompanied by a poor specificity. Since poor specificity, however, translates to a high number of unnecessary secondary investigations, like colonoscopy, an assay with a poor specificity also does not meet the requirements of a generally accepted screening assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCalprotectin has been described as an alternative biomarker for the detection of CRC from stool samples in \n \nUS 5,455,160\n \n and correspondingly in the scientific literature by \nRoseth, A.G., et al. (Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 27 (1992) 793-798\n; \nScand. J. Gastroenterol. 28 (1993) 1073-1076\n). Although calprotectin is a marker of inflammatory diseases its potential as a marker for the detection of CRC from stool is documented by several publications (\nJohne, B., et al., Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 36 (2001) 291-296\n; \nLimburg, P.J., et al., Am. J. Gastroenterol. 98 (2003) 2299-2305\n; \nHoff, G., et al., Gut 53 (2004) 1329-1333\n). While the sensitivity and specificity of calprotectin are comparable to the immunological hemoglobin assay, calprotectin appears to have some characteristics favorable for a diagnostic biomarker as compared to hemoglobin. It is evenly distributed in feces, it is stable at room temperature making mail delivery of the sample to the laboratory feasible and it shows no interference with food components or pharmaceutical compounds (\nTon, H., et al., Clin. Chim. Acta 292 (2000) 41-54\n). However, elevated concentrations of calprotectin, the heterodimer of S100A8 and S100A9, were detected in stool samples from patients suffering from CRC, Crohn's disease or inflammatory bowel disease. These results are in agreement with the more general role of calprotectin in inflammation (\nRyckman, C., et al., J. Immunol. 170 (2003) 3233-3242\n). Hence, the use of calprotectin in gastroenterology is not limited to the detection of CRC but extends to other disesases, especially inflammatory bowel disease as reviewed by \nPoullis, A., et al. (J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 18 (2003) 756-762\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn international patent application \n \nWO 2004/079368\n \n it is mentioned that S100 A8 or S100A9, respectively, are up-regulated in part of the CRC-tissue samples investigated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nSieg A., et al., International Journal of Colorectal Tissue Disease, 14(6), 1999, p 267-271\n, report on the detection of colorectal cancer by sensitive measurement of the hemoglobin/haptoglobin complex in fecal samples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \n \nUS 2004/157278\n \n it is disclosed that up-regulation of the gene coding for human islet regenerating protein 1 (Reg1α) and up-regulation of other genes like the one coding for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases 1 (TIMP-1) is associated with colorectal cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further alternative method to the guaiac test for detection of CRC in stool has been published recently and consists in the detection of the colorectal cancer-specific antigen, \"minichromosome maintenance protein 2\" (MCM2) by immunohistochemistry in colonic cells shed into stool. Due to the small study size, conclusion on the diagnostic value for detection of colorectal cancer is preliminary. However, the test seems to have only limited sensitivity to detect right-sided colon cancer (\nDavies, R.J. et al., Lancet 359 (2002) 1917-1919\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, an assay for detection of pyruvate kinase M2 isoenzyme (M2-PK) has been introduced into the market (Schebo Biotech, Gießen, Germany). A comparison of the guaiac assay to the immuno assays for hemoglobin and M2-PK has for example been performed by \nVogel, T. et. al., Dtsch. Med. Wochenschr. 130 (2005) 872-877\n. They show that the immunological assays are superior to the guaiac test and that at comparable specificity the M2-PK assay is less sensitive in detecting CRC as compared to the hemoglobin assay. Yet, the authors conclude that the usefulness of both these stool based assays is still questionable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe identification of an early CRC tumor marker that would allow reliable cancer detection or provide early prognostic information by non-invasive means from a stool specimen could lead to a diagnostic assay that would greatly aid in the diagnosis and in the management of this disease. Therefore, an urgent clinical need exists to improve the diagnosis of CRC, especially from stool. It is especially important to improve the early diagnosis of CRC, since for patients diagnosed early on chances of survival are much higher as compared to those diagnosed at a progressed stage of disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was the task of the present invention to investigate whether a new marker can be identified which may aid in CRC diagnosis. Preferably such marker would be present in stool and allow for a non-invasive diagnosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly, it has been found that the use of the protein S100A12 as a marker for CRC can at least partially overcome the problems known from the state of the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention therefore relates to a method for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer comprising the steps of\n\n \n \n \na) providing a stool sample obtained from an individual,\n \nb) contacting said sample with a specific binding agent for S100A12 under conditions appropriate for formation of a complex between said binding agent and S100A12\n \nc) determining the amount of complex formed in step (b), and\n \nd) correlating the amount of complex determined in (c) to the diagnosis of colorectal cancer.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs the skilled artisan will appreciate, any such measurement of S100A12 is made in vitro. The patient sample is discarded afterwards. The patient sample is solely used for the in vitro method of the invention and no material of the patient sample is transferred back into the patient's body. Neither measurement of S100A12 nor the assessment of CRC is performed on the human or animal body.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe in vitro diagnostic procedure according to the present invention is used to assess the absence, the presence or the relative concentration of S100A12 in a stool sample. The value measured for S100A12 will aid the clinician in assessing CRC, e.g., in his establishing a clinical diagnosis and/or in his decision for an appropriate treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment the stool sample is processed to obtain a processed sample liquid which is more convenient to handle than a stool specimen. Such processed sample is then incubated with the specific binding agent for S100A12. The present invention therefore also relates to a method for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer comprising the steps of\n\n \n \n \na) providing a stool sample obtained from an individual,\n \nb) processing said sample to obtain a processed liquid sample,\n \nc) contacting said processed liquid sample with a specific binding agent for S100A12 under conditions appropriate for formation of a complex between said binding agent and S100A12, and\n \nd) correlating the amount of complex formed in (c) to the diagnosis of colorectal cancer.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAnother preferred embodiment of the invention is a method for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer comprising the steps of\n\n \n \n \na) processing a stool sample obtained from an individual to obtain a processed liquid sample,\n \nb) contacting said processed liquid sample with a specific binding agent for S100A12 under conditions appropriate for formation of a complex between said binding agent and S100A12,\n \nc) determining the amount of complex formed in step (b), and\n \nd) correlating the amount of complex determined in (c) to the diagnosis of colorectal cancer.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment the present invention discloses a method for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer comprising the steps of providing a stool sample obtained from an individual, contacting said sample with a specific binding agent for S100A12 under conditions appropriate for formation of a complex between said binding agent and S100A12, contacting said sample with a specific binding agent for a second marker selected from the group consisting of hemoglobin/haptoglobin complex, hemoglobin, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases 1 (TIMP-1), and tumor M2 pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) under conditions appropriate for formation of a complex between said binding agent and the second marker, detection the amount of complex formed for S100A12 and the at least one second marker, and correlating the amount of complexes determined to the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. In further preferred embodiments the method according to the present invention is based on the determination and of S100A12 and of hemoglobin as the second marker, the determination of S100A12 and of the hemoglobin/haptoglobin complex as the second marker, the determination of S100A12 and of TIMP-1 as the second marker, and the determination of S100A12 and of M2-PK as the second marker, respectively. As obvious to the skilled artisan the measurement of S100A12 and the measurement of the at least one second marker can be made from the same aliquot of a stool sample or of a processed stool sample, respectively, or from different aliquots of a patient's stool sample or from different aliquots of a patient's processed stool sample, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment the stool sample is processed to retrieve colonocytes which are then smeared on a microscopic slide. Such processed sample is then incubated with the specific binding agent for S100A12. The present invention therefore also relates to a method for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer comprising the steps of\n\n \n \n \na) providing a stool sample obtained from an individual,\n \nb) processing said sample to retrieve colonocytes,\n \nc) contacting said processed sample with a specific binding agent for S100A12 under conditions appropriate for formation of a complex between said binding agent and S100A12, and\n \nd) correlating the amount of complex formed in (c) to the diagnosis of colorectal cancer.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe protein S100A12 (=Calgranulin C) is characterized by the sequence given SEQ ID N0: 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nS100A12 is also called CAAF1; CAGC; calcium binding protein in amniotic fluid; calgranulin related protein; CGRP; calcium binding protein in \namniotic fluid\n 1; Calgranulin C; ENRAGE (extracellular newly identified RAGE binding protein); neutrophil S100 protein; S100 calcium binding protein A12. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the S100 family of proteins containing 2 EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. S100 proteins are localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein is proposed to be involved in specific calcium-dependent signal transduction pathways and its regulatory effect on cytoskeletal components may modulate various neutrophil activities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO 2005/054508\n \n relates to methods of gene expression profiling using pools of polynucleotide arrays and to the association of such profiles to histopathological features of colorectal cancer tissue. S100 A12 is comprised amongst the several hundred differentially expressed genes mentioned in this patent application. Detection of S100A12 on the protein level in CRC tissue, a body fluid or in a stool sample is not shown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe physiologically relevant structure of S100A12 is a Ca \n2+\n-binding homodimer. As S100A12 is also released from cells, extracellular functions have been described e.g., regulation of inflammatory processes (\nFoell, D. et al. Clin. Chim. Acta 344 (2004) 37-51\n). Together with S100A8 (= calgranulin A) and S100A9 (calgranulin B) S100A12 is expressed in granulocytes, where the calgranulin proteins constitute up to 50 % of the soluble cytosolic protein content. Upon acute inflammation S100A12 is released and it has been found in different diseases including irritable bowl diseases, Morbus Crohn, Kawasaki's disease or rheumatoid arthritis (\nBurmeister, G. and Gallacchi, G., Inflammopharmacology 3 (1995) 221-230\n; \nFoell, D. et al., Rheumatology 42 (2003) 1383-1389\n). When the signal cascade of the S100A12 response was investigated it was linked to a novel inflammatory axis via the receptor for advanced glycated endproducts (=RAGE). This receptor can be found in various tissue types including e.g., endothelium and cells of the immune system (\nHofmann, M.A. et al., Cell 97 (1999) 889 - 901\n; \nSchmidt, A. M. et al., J. Clin. Invest. 108 (2001) 949-955\n). Besides being involved in the inflammatory response, the RAGE-pathway has also been described in wound healing, tumor outgrowth or systemic amyloidosis (Hofmann, M.A. et al., supra; Schmidt, A.M. et al., supra; \nYan, S.S. et al., Nat. Med. 9 (2003) 287-293\n; \nHofmann, M.A. et al., Genes Immun. 3 (2002) 123-135\n). Hence S100A12 might have a broad range of effects. However, no relation to tumor processes has been described to date.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the novel marker S100A12 is used in the screening for CRC. When used in patient monitoring the diagnostic method according to the present invention may help to assess tumor load, efficacy of treatment and tumor recurrence in the follow-up of patients. Increased levels of S100A12 are directly correlated to tumor burden. After chemotherapy a short term (few hours to 14 days) increase in S100A12 may serve as an indicator of tumor cell death. In the long term follow-up of patients after surgery and/or chemotherapy (from 3 months to 10 years) an increase of S100A12 can be used as an indicator for tumor recurrence in the colorectum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment the diagnostic method according to the present invention is used for screening purposes. I.e., it is used to assess subjects without a prior diagnosis of CRC by measuring the level of S100A12 in a stool sample and correlating the level measured to the presence or absence of CRC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs the skilled artisan will readily appreciate, in such screening care has to be taken that an appropriate amount of a stool sample is used. Preferably a defined amount of stool sample is used for the measurement of S100A12 comprised therein. Preferably the amount of S100A12 is expressed in terms of amount of S100A12 per amount of stool, i.e., the relative concentration of S100A12 is given.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diagnostic method may not only be used for the screening of the general asymptomatic population but also in an alternative preferred embodiment for surveillance of high risk individuals. Such a high risk individuals preferably are selected from the group consisting of individuals with iron deficiency anemia, first grade relatives of CRC-patients, patients with a family history of CRC and patients with newly detected polyps or a history of gastrointestinal neoplasia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor a screening assay not only the AUC value is relevant. A quite critical requirement in a screening setting is a good enough sensitivity at a high and clinically relevant level of specificity. High specificity is crucial because if this requirement would not be fulfilled, this would result in a high number of false positive results accompanied by unnecessary follow-up procedures and distress for the patients. In other preferred embodiments the level of specificity is set to 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%, respectively, as compared to CRC-negative individuals of the clinically relevant screening population.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs the skilled artisan will appreciate a cut off-value for S100A12 is established based on S100A12-values as measured in the stool sample derived from individuals of a healthy normal population. The clinically relevant normal population in a screening setting preferably consists of clinically healthy individuals in the age of 55 to 65 years. An S100A12-value in a stool sample above an established cut-off value may be considered indicative for CRC or may at least warrant further diagnostic examination of the respective individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nColorectal cancer most frequently progresses from adenomas (polyps) to malignant carcinomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe staging of cancer is the classification of the disease in terms of extent, progression, and severity. It groups cancer patients so that generalizations can be made about prognosis and the choice of therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe different stages of CRC used to be classified according to Dukes' stages A to D. Today, the TNM system is the most widely used classification of the anatomical extent of cancer. It represents an internationally accepted, uniform staging system. There are three basic variables: T (the extent of the primary tumor), N (the status of regional lymph nodes) and M (the presence or absence of distant metastases). The TNM criteria are published by the UICC (International Union Against Cancer), \nSobin, L.H., Wittekind, Ch. (eds): TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, sixth edition, 2002\n). Once the TNM status is determined the patients are grouped into disease stages that are denoted by Roman numerals ranging form I to IV with IV being the most advanced disease stage. TNM staging and UICC disease stages correspond to each other as shown in the following Table 1 taken from Sobin L.H. and Wittekind (eds.) \nsupra.\n\n\n \n \nTable 1:\n Interrelation of TNM staging and UICC disease stages\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUICC disease stage\n \n \n \nT staging\n \n \n \nN staging\n \n \n \n \nM staging\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStage\n \n \n \n 0\n \nTis\n \nN0\n \nM0\n \n \n \nStage I\n \nT1, T2\n \nN0\n \nM0\n \n \n \nStage IIA\n \nT3\n \nN0\n \nM0\n \n \n \nStage IIB\n \nT4\n \nN0\n \nM0\n \n \n \nStage IIIA\n \nT1, T2\n \nN1\n \nM0\n \n \n \nStage IIIB\n \nT3, T4\n \nN1\n \nM0\n \n \n \nStage IIIC\n \nAny T\n \nN2\n \nM0\n \n \n \nStage IV\n \nAny T\n \nAny N\n \nM1\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhat is especially important is, that early diagnosis of CRC translates to a much better prognosis. Malignant tumors of the colorectum arise from benign tumors, i.e. from adenoma. Therefore, best prognosis have those patients diagnosed at the adenoma stage. Patients diagnosed as early as in stage T\nis\n, N0, M0 or T1-3; N0; M0, if treated properly have a more than 90% chance of survival 5 years after diagnosis as compared to a 5-years survival rate of only 10% for patients diagnosed when distant metastases are already present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the sense of the present invention early diagnosis of CRC refers to a diagnosis at a tumor stage where no metastases at all (neither proximal = N0, nor distal = M0) are present, i.e. the stages of, T\nis\n, N0, M0 or T1-4; N0; M0. T\nis\n denotes carcinoma \nin situ.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is preferred, that CRC is diagnosed when it has not yet fully grown through the bowel wall and thus neither the visceral peritoneum is perforated nor other organs or structures are invaded, i.e., that diagnosis is made at any stage from T\nis\n; N0; M0 to T3; N0; M0 (=T\nis\n-3; N0; M0).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diagnostic method according to the present invention is based on a stool sample which is derived from an individual. The stool sample is extracted and S100A12 is specifically measured from this processed stool sample by use of a specific binding agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA specific binding agent is, e.g., a receptor for S100A12, a lectin binding to S100A12, an aptamer to S100A12, or an antibody to S100A12. A specific binding agent has at least an affinity of 10\n7\n l/mol for its corresponding target molecule. The specific binding agent preferably has an affinity of 10\n8\n l/mol or even more preferred of 10\n9\n l/mol for its target molecule. As the skilled artisan will appreciate the term specific is used to indicate that other biomolecules present in the sample do not significantly bind to with the binding agent specific for S100A12. Preferably, the level of binding to a biomolecule other than the target molecule results in a binding affinity which is only 10%, more preferably only 5% of the affinity of the target molecule or less. A most preferred specific binding agent will fulfill both the above minimum criteria for affinity as well as for specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA specific binding agent preferably is an antibody reactive with S100A12. The term antibody refers to a polyclonal antibody, a monoclonal antibody, fragments of such antibodies, as well as genetic constructs comprising the binding domain of an antibody. Any antibody fragment retaining the above criteria of a specific binding agent can be used. Antibodies are generated by state of the art procedures, e.g., as described in Tijssen (\nTijssen, P., Practice and theory of enzyme immunoassays 11 (1990) the whole book, especially pages 43-78, Elsevier, Amsterd\nam). In addition, the skilled artisan is well aware of methods based on immunosorbents that can be used for the specific isolation of antibodies. By these means the quality of polyclonal antibodies and hence their performance in immunoassays can be enhanced (Tijssen, P., \nsupra,\n pages 108-115).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the achievements as disclosed in the present invention polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits have been used. However, clearly also polyclonal antibodies from different species , e.g. rats or guinea pigs, as well as monoclonal antibodies can also be used. Since monoclonal antibodies can be produced in any amount required with constant properties, they represent ideal tools in development of an assay for clinical routine. The generation and use of monoclonal antibodies to S100A12 in a method according to the present invention is yet another preferred embodiment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs the skilled artisan will appreciate now, that S100A12 has been identified by measurement in an immunoassay as a marker which is useful in the diagnosis of CRC, alternative ways may be used to reach a result comparable to the achievements of the present invention. The marker protein S100A12 may be detected by any appropriate means and used as a marker of CRC. Such preferred appropriate means comprise the detection of the S100A12 polypeptide by an immuno assay procedure, by liquid chromatography, especially high performance liquid chromatography, by electrophoresis, especially SDS-PAGE combined with Western Blotting and by mass spectroscopy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor measurement, the stool sample is obtained from an individual. An aliquot of the stool sample may be used directly. Preferably an aliquot of the stool sample is processed to yield a liquid sample. A processed stool sample is a liquid sample obtained upon extraction of a stool sample with an extraction buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe processing of the stool sample is accomplished by an extraction buffer that is optimized for the task. It should fulfill at least three basic requirements: It should liberate the analyte of interest from the stool matrix. It should stabilize the free analyte. It should minimize the interference of the stool matrix in the subsequent detection of the analyte. Since marker combinations might hold additional diagnostic potential, an optimized buffer should not only be applicable for one specific biomarker but for all analytes of interest. The extraction buffer may contain urea to improve the homogenization and extraction of the stool sample. Ca\n2+\n may be included for stabilization of a Ca\n2+\n-binding protein. Since S100 proteins are known to be Ca\n2+\n-binding proteins the extraction buffer preferably will contain Ca\n2+\n-ions to stabilize such proteins. Weak chelating agents should be used that on the one hand can break ion bridges between Ca\n2+\n -binding proteins and the stool matrix. However, on the other hand, these Ca\n2+\n-complexing agents have to bind Ca\n2+\n-ions sufficiently weak to avoid stripping of Ca\n2+\n-ions from S100A12. Preferably nitrilotriacetic acid or citrate are used as chelators in a stool extraction buffer. An optimized and preferred extraction buffer contains urea, Ca\n2+\n-ions and a chelator. Preferably the chelator is selected from the group consisting of nitrilotriacetic acid or citrate. An optimized extraction buffer is e.g. used in the processing of a stool sample as shown in Example 4b.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is most convenient to use an optimized extraction buffer in combination with a tailor-made stool sampling device. In a most convenient way, an individual collects a defined amount of stool sample and transfers it directly into the collection prefillcd with the stabilizing extraction buffer. This convenient mode of sampling and extraction enables the transport of the specimen to a diagnostic laboratory without degradation of the analyte. Since the extraction of the stool sample can be achieved directly in the sampling device the necessary handling and transfer procedures are reduced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral recent developments have focused on devices that facilitate the sampling and handling of a stool sample. \n \n \nEP\n 1 366 715\n \n discloses a special collection tube for collection of a stool sample. This extraction tube essentially comprises (a) a container body that is hollow on the inside, open at the top, and able to receive a buffer solution, (b) a top cap provided with a threaded small rod for collection of fecal samples, said threaded small rod protruding axially inside the container body, when the top cap is applied to the top end of the container body, and (c) a dividing partition provided, in an intermediate position, inside said container body so as to separate a top chamber from a bottom chamber inside said container body, said dividing partition having an axial hole suitable to allow the passage of said threaded small rod, so as to retain the excess feces in said top chamber and allow the passage of the threaded part of the small rod into said bottom chamber. This extraction tube further has a container body that is open at the bottom and provided with a bottom cap which can be applied movably to the bottom end of the container body, so that said extraction tube can be used directly as a primary sampling tube to be inserted into a sample-holder plate of automatic analyzers, following removal of said bottom cap and overturning of said container body. The device disclosed in \n \n \nEP\n 1 366 715\n \n allows for the convenient handling of a defined quantity of a stool sample and has the advantage that after appropriate extraction the tube may be directly placed into the sample-holder of an automatic analyzer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA second example of a sophisticated stool sampling device that is appropriate for a convenient sampling and handling of a stool sample is described in \n \nWO 03/068398\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stool sample is preferably used or processed directly after sampling or stored cooled or more conveniently stored frozen. Frozen stool samples can be processed by thawing, followed by dilution in an appropriate buffer, mixing and centrifugation. Supernatants are used as liquid sample for subsequent measurement of the marker S100A12.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aliquot of the processed stool sample is incubated with the specific binding agent for S100A12 under conditions appropriate for formation of a binding agent S100A12-complex. Such conditions need not be specified, since the skilled artisan without any inventive effort can easily identify such appropriate incubation conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a final step according to the method disclosed in the present invention the amount of complex is measured and correlated to the diagnosis of CRC. As the skilled artisan will appreciate there are numerous methods to measure the amount of the specific binding agent S100A12-complex all described in detail in relevant textbooks (cf., e.g., Tijssen P., \nsupra,\n or \nDiamandis et al. (eds.), Immunoassay, Academic Press, Boston (1996\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably S100A12 is detected in a sandwich type assay format. In such assay a first specific binding agent is used to capture S100A12 on the one side and a second specific binding agent, which is labeled to be directly or indirectly detectable is used on the other side.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies to S100A12 can also be used for assessment of CRC in other procedures, e.g., to detect colorectal cancer cells in situ, in biopsies, or in immunohistological staining procedures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, an antibody to S100A12 is used in a qualitative (S100A12 present or absent) or quantitative (S100A12 amount is determined) immunoassay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, it has surprisingly been found that S100A12 can be measured from a stool sample obtained from an individual sample. No tissue and no biopsy sample is required to apply the marker S100A12 in the diagnosis of CRC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhereas application of routine proteomics methods to tissue samples, e.g. by comparing healthy and cancerous tissue, leads to the identification of many potential marker candidates for the tissue/disease selected, these marker candidates only accidentally and in rare cases are found in the circulation. Surprisingly, the inventors of the present invention have been able to detect protein S100A12 in a stool sample. They have been able to demonstrate that the presence of S100A12 in such stool sample obtained from an individual can be correlated to the diagnosis of colorectal cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has also been found that the presence or absence of S100A12 in such stool sample obtained from an individual can be correlated to the presence or absence of colorectal cancer in a patient. The present invention also relates to a method for excluding colorectal cancer comprising the steps of a) providing a stool sample obtained from an individual, b) processing said sample to obtain a processed liquid sample, c) contacting said processed liquid sample with a specific binding agent for S100A12 under conditions appropriate for formation of a complex between said binding agent and S100A12, and d) using the absence of a complex in (c) as an indicator for the absence of colorectal cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs the skilled artisan will appreciate, a positive result for S100A12 in a stool sample must not necessarily mean that the patient has CRC. However, a positive value for S100A12 in a stool sample should be considered a clear-cut indicator to warrant further and more sophisticated diagnostics. In a preferred embodiment a positive value for S100A12 as measured from a stool sample is used as an indicator that the patient should be offered further investigations, especially a virtual computed tomographic colonography (VCTC) or a colonoscopy. Preferably, a positive value in a stool sample is used as an indicator that colonoscopy as the next step in the (diagnostic) examination of a patient is warranted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeasuring the level of protein S100A12 has proven very advantageous in the field of CRC. Therefore, in a further preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to use of protein S100A12 as a marker molecule in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer from a stool sample obtained from an individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term marker molecule is used to indicate that the presence of or an increased level of the analyte S100A12 as measured from a processed stool sample obtained from an individual marks the presence of CRC. Obviously the marker S100A12 may be measured by any appropriate means an the presence or value measured used in the assessment of CRC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs obvious to the skilled artisan, the present invention shall not be construed to be limited to the measurement of the full-length protein S100A12 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Physiological fragments of S100A12 can also be measured and used as a marker for CRC while practicing the present invention. Immunologically detectable fragments preferably comprise at least 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15 or 20 contiguous amino acids of said marker polypeptide. One of skill in the art would recognize that proteins which are released by cells or present in the extracellular matrix may be damaged, e.g., during inflammation, and could become degraded or cleaved into such fragments. As the skilled artisan will appreciate, S100A12 or fragments thereof may also be present as part of a complex. Such complex also may be used as a marker in the sense of the present invention. In addition, or in the alternative the S100A12 polypeptide may carry a post-translational modification, and such modified S100A12 may also serve as a marker of CRC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nArtificial fragments of S100A12 may be used, e.g. as a positive control in an immuno assay or as an immunogen. Artificial fragments preferably encompass a peptide produced synthetically or by recombinant techniques consisting of at least 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, or at least 15 contiguous amino acids as derived from the sequence disclosed in SEQ ID NO:1. Preferably such artificial fragment comprises at least one epitope of diagnostic interest. Also preferred the artificial fragment comprises at least two epitopes of interest and is appropriate for use as a positive control in a sandwich immunoassay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is preferred to use the novel marker S100A12 in the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, as the skilled artisan will appreciate S100A12, alike other markers, will also be of great advantage in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients already suffering from CRC at more advanced stages of tumor progression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe S100A12 concentration closely correlates with tumor burden in CRC. The marker is therefore also suitable for the follow-up of CRC patients after treatment. In a preferred embodiment, the novel marker S100A12 is used in the follow-up of patients suffering from CRC. By measuring CRC regularly, e.g. at 3-monthly, 6-monthly or yearly intervals, tumor progression and/or as the case may be tumor recurrence can be assessed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn increase or a re-appearance of S100A12 above the normal cut-off value are considered indicative for CRC tumor progression or for tumor recurrence, respectively. A further preferred embodiment therefore relates to a method of assessing by an in vitro measurement a patient suffering from colorectal cancer after surgery for removal of the cancerous lesion the method comprising the steps of a) providing a stool sample obtained from said patient, b) contacting said sample with a specific binding agent for S100A12 under conditions appropriate for formation of a complex between said binding agent and S100A12, c) determining the amount of complex formed in step (b) and d) correlating the amount of complex determined in (c) to a recurrence or progression of colorectal cancer. Measurement of S100A12 from a stool sample is especially helpful and in a preferred embodiment is used in the early detection of a CRC tumor recurrence within the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe colon as well as the rectum both are part of the gastrointestinal tract. Now that it has been shown that S100A12 most likely will be useful in the screening of patients for colorectal cancer, it is very likely that the presence of S100A12 in a stool sample may also be used as a diagnostic aid in the assessment of other types of gastrointestinal cancer. In a further preferred embodiment the present invention relates to the use of S100A12 as measured from a stool sample in the assessment of a gastrointestinal tumor. Preferably S100A12 as measured from a stool sample is also used in the assessment a stomach tumor. Measurement of S100A12 from a stool sample can be helpful and therefore represents a preferred embodiment according to the present invention in the early detection of a gastrointestinal tumor recurrence within the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of protein S100A12 itself, represents a significant progress to the challenging field of CRC diagnosis from stool. Combining measurements of S100A12 with other known markers, like hemoglobin or the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex, or with other markers of CRC yet to be discovered, leads and may lead, respectively, to further improvements in the assessment of CRC. Therefore in a further preferred embodiment the present invention relates to the use of S100A12 as a marker molecule for colorectal cancer in combination with one or more other marker molecules for colorectal cancer in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer from a stool sample obtained from an individual. Preferred selected other CRC markers with which the measurement of S100A12 may be combined are TIMP-1, calprotectin, tumor M2 pyruvate kinase (M2-PK), hemoglobin and/or the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a further preferred embodiment the present invention discloses the use of protein S100A12 as a marker molecule for colorectal cancer in combination with one or more other marker molecule(s) for colorectal cancer selected from the group consisting of hemoglobin/haptoglobin complex, hemoglobin, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases 1 (TIMP-1), calprotectin, and tumor M2 pyruvate kinase (M2-PK).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment the present invention relates to the use of a marker combination comprising the markers S100A12 and TIMP-1 in the assessment of CRC, whereas both markers are measured from a stool sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment the present invention relates to the use of a marker combination comprising the markers S100A12 and hemoglobin in the assessment of CRC, whereas both markers are measured from a stool sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment the present invention relates to the use of a marker combination comprising the markers S100A12 and the hemoglobin/haptoglobin complex in the assessment of CRC, whereas both markers are measured from a stool sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment the present invention relates to the use of a marker combination comprising the markers S100A12 and tumor M2 pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) in the assessment of CRC, whereas both markers are measured from a stool sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet a further preferred embodiment the present invention relates to the use of a marker combination comprising the markers S100A12, TIMP-1 and hemoglobin in the assessment of CRC, whereas all three markers are measured from a stool sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet a further preferred embodiment the present invention relates to the use of a marker combination comprising the markers S100A12, TIMP-1 and the hemoglobin/haptoglobin complex in the assessment of CRC, whereas all three markers are measured from a stool sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTIMP-1 (=tissue plasminogen activator 1)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMatrix metalloproteinases (MMP's) play a pivotal role in cancer growth and spread, contributing to enzymatic degradation of the extracellular matrix. The naturally occurring inhibitors of MMP's, are called tissue inhibitors of MMP's or TIMP's. TIMP's form tight 1:1 stoichiometric complexes with the activated forms of the MMP's thereby inhibiting the catalytic activity of these enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of enzyme-linked immunoassays for the detection of TIMP-1 (\nKodama, S., et al., Matrix 9 (1989) 1-6\n; \nCooksley, S., et al., Matrix 10 (1990) 285-291\n; \nClark, I.M., et al., Matrix 11 (1991) 76-85\n) and TIMP-2 (\nFujimoto, N., et al., Clin. Chim. Acta 220 (1993) 31-45\n) have been described. These assays have been applied to body fluids, e.g. serum, plasma, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid and urine. No data can be found, in the art demonstrating the presence of TIMP-1 in a stool sample. No data are available in the art, indicative for the fact that the presence of TIMP-1 in a stool sample could be of clinical utility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiagnostic reagents in the field of specific binding assays, like immunoassays, usually are best provided in the form of a kit, which comprises the specific binding agent and the auxiliary reagents required to perform the assay. The present invention therefore also relates to an immunological kit comprising at least one specific binding agent for S100A12 and auxiliary reagents for measurement of S100A12.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccuracy of a diagnostic test is often described by its receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) (see especially \nZweig, M.H. and Campbell, G., Clin. Chem. 39 (1993) 561-577\n). The ROC graph is a plot of all of the sensitivity/specificity pairs resulting from continuously varying the decision thresh-hold over the entire range of data observed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe clinical performance of a laboratory test depends on its diagnostic accuracy, or the ability to correctly classify subjects into clinically relevant subgroups. Diagnostic accuracy measures the test's ability to correctly distinguish two different conditions of the subjects investigated. Such conditions are for example health and disease or benign versus malignant disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn each case, the ROC plot depicts the overlap between the two distributions by plotting the sensitivity versus 1 - specificity for the complete range of decision thresholds. On the y-axis is sensitivity, or the true-positive fraction [defined as (number of true-positive test results) / (number of true-positive + number of false-negative test results)]. This has also been referred to as positivity in the presence of a disease or condition. It is calculated solely from the affected subgroup. On the x-axis is the false-positive fraction, or 1 - specificity [defined as (number of false-positive results) / (number of true-negative + number of false-positive results)]. It is an index of specificity and is calculated entirely from the unaffected subgroup. Because the true- and false-positive fractions are calculated entirely separately, by using the test results from two different subgroups, the ROC plot is independent of the prevalence of disease in the sample. Each point on the ROC plot represents a sensitivity/l-specificity pair corresponding to a particular decision threshold. A test with perfect discrimination (no overlap in the two distributions of results) has an ROC plot that passes through the upper left corner, where the true-positive fraction is 1.0, or 100% (perfect sensitivity), and the false-positive fraction is 0 (perfect specificity). The theoretical plot for a test with no discrimination (identical distributions of results for the two groups) is a 45° diagonal line from the lower left corner to the upper right corner. Most plots fall in between these two extremes. (If the ROC plot falls completely below the 45° diagonal, this is easily remedied by reversing the criterion for \"positivity\" from \"greater than\" to \"less than\" or vice versa.) Qualitatively, the closer the plot is to the upper left corner, the higher the overall accuracy of the test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne convenient goal to quantify the diagnostic accuracy of a laboratory test is to express its performance by a single number. The most common global measure is the area under the curve of the ROC plot. By convention, this area is always ≥ 0.5 (if it is not, one can reverse the decision rule to make it so). Values range between 1.0 (perfect separation of the test values of the two groups) and 0.5 (no apparent distributional difference between the two groups of test values). The area does not depend only on a particular portion of the plot such as the point closest to the diagonal or the sensitivity at 90% specificity, but on the entire plot. This is a quantitative, descriptive expression of how close the AUC is to the perfect one (area = 1.0).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClinical utility of the novel marker S100A12 has been assessed in comparison to and in combination with the established marker hemoglobin using a receiver operator characteristics analysis (ROC; \nZweig, M.H. and Campbell, G., Clin. Chem. 39 (1993) 561-577\n). This analysis has been based on samples derived from well-defined patient cohorts as given in the examples section.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diagnostic method based on measurement of S100A12 alone in comparison to the established marker hemoglobin alone has been found to have an at least as good a diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity/specificity profile) as demonstrated by the area under the curve.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples, figures and sequence listing are provided to aid the understanding of the present invention, the true scope of which is set forth in the appended claims.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Figure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nFigure 1:\n\n\n\n\n \nWestern Blot analysis\n \n\nTumor and normal tissue of four CRC patients was analyzed by Western Blot using a polyclonal antibody against human S100A12.

From each patient three different tissue types are collected from therapeutic resections: tumor tissue (>80% tumor) (T), adjacent healthy tissue (N) and stripped mucosa from adjacent healthy mucosa (M). The latter two tissue types serve as matched healthy control samples. Tissues are immediately snap frozen after resection and stored at -80°C before processing. Tumors are diagnosed by histopathological criteria.\n\n\n \n\n\nTissue preparation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n0.8-1.2 g of frozen tissue are put into a mortar and completely frozen by liquid nitrogen. The tissue is pulverized in the mortar, dissolved in the 10-fold volume (w/v) of lysis buffer (40 mM Na-citrate, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1% Genapol X-080, 0.02% Na-azide, Complete\n®\n EDTA-free [Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany, Cat. No. 1 873 580]) and subsequently homogenized in a Wheaton® glass homogenizer (20 x loose fitting, 20 x tight fitting). 3 ml of the homogenate are subjected to a sucrose-density centrifugation (10-60% sucrose) for 1 h at 4,500 x g. After this centrifugation step three fractions are obtained. The fraction on top of the gradient contains the soluble proteins and is used for further analysis.\n\n\n \n\n\nSample preparation for LC-ESI-MSMS-analysis\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe protein concentration of the soluble protein fraction is determined using Bio-Rad® protein assay (Cat.No. 500-0006; Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH, München, Germany) following the instructions of the supplier's manual. To a volume corresponding to 200 µg of protein 4 ml reduction buffer (9 M urea, 2 mM DTT, 100 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, pH 8.2 NaOH) is added and incubated for 1 h. The solution is concentrated to 250 µl in an Amicon\n®\n Ultra 10 kD device (Millipore GmbH, Schwalbach, Germany). For alkylation the 250 µl are transferred into 1 ml alkylation buffer (9 M urea, 4 mM iodoacetamide, 100 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, pH 8.2 NaOH), incubated for 6 h and subsequently concentrated in an Amicon\n®\n Ultra 10 kD device to 250 µl. For washing 1 ml 9 M urea is added and again concentrated in an Amicon\n®\n Ultra 10 kD device to 250 µl. Washing is repeated three-times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor protease digestion the concentrated solution is diluted to 2.5 M urea and incubated with 4 µg trypsin (Proteomics grade, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) over night. The digestion is stopped by adding 1 \nml\n 1% formic acid and analyzed.\n\n\n \n\n\nLC-ESI-MSMS-analysis\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe tryptic digest (500 µl) is separated on a two-dimensional Nano-HPLC-System (Ultimate, Famos, Switchos; LC Packings, Idstein, Germany) consisting of a SCX and a RP Pepmep C18 column (LC Packings, Idstein, Germany). The 11 SCX fractions (step elution with 0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1.500 mM NH\n4\nAc) where successively further separated on the RP column with a 90 min gradient (5-95% acetonitrile) and online analyzed using data dependent scans with an ESI-MS ion trap (LCQ deca XP; Thermo Electron, Massachusetts, USA; see Table 2 for parameters). For each sample three runs are performed. The raw data are processed with Bioworks 3.1 software (Thermo Electron, Massachusetts, USA) using the parameters listed in Table 2. The resulting lists of identified peptides and proteins from replicate runs where combined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protein S100A12 is identified by aid of the partial sequences given in Table 3.\n\n\n \n\n\nDetection of S100A12 as a potential marker for colorectal cancer\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor each patient the identified proteins and the number of corresponding peptides from the tumor sample are compared to the accordant results from adjacent normal tissue and from stripped normal mucosa tissue. By this means, protein S100A12 is found to be specifically expressed or strongly overexpressed in tumor tissue and not or less detectable or less strongly expressed in healthy control tissue. It therefore - amongst many other proteins - qualifies as a candidate marker for use in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protein S100A12 was strongly over-represented in tumor tissue from patients suffering from colorectal cancer.

Such measurements of S100A12 e.g. are performed by immunodetection assays, e.g. Western Blotting and ELISA.\n\n\n \n\n\nRecombinant protein expression in E. coli\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to generate antibodies to S100A12, recombinant expression of the protein is performed for obtaining immunogens. The expression is done applying a combination of the \nRTS\n 100 expression system and E.coli. In a first step, the DNA sequence is analyzed and recommendations for high yield cDNA silent mutational variants and respective PCR-primer sequences are obtained using the \"ProteoExpert RTS E.coli HY\" system. This is a commercial web based service (www.proteoexpert.com). Using the recommended primer pairs, the \"\nRTS\n 100 E. coli Linear Template Generation Set, His-tag\" (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany, Cat.No. 3186237) system to generate linear PCR templates from the cDNA and for in-vitro transcription and expression of the nucleotide sequence coding for the S100A12 protein is used. For Western-blot detection and later purification, the expressed protein contains a His-tag. The best expressing variant is identified. All steps from PCR to expression and detection are carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The respective PCR product, containing all necessary T7 regulatory regions (promoter, ribosomal binding site and T7 terminator) is cloned into the pBAD TOPO\n®\n vector (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany, Cat. No. K 4300/01) following the manufacturer's instructions. For expression using the T7 regulatory sequences, the construct is transformed into E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) (\nStudier, F.W., et al., Methods Enzymol. 185 (1990) 60-89\n) and the transformed bacteria are cultivated in a 11 batch for protein expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurification of His-S100A12 fusion protein is done following standard procedures on a Ni-chelate column. Briefly, 1l of bacteria culture containing the expression vector for the His-S100A12 fusion protein is pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellet is resuspended in lysis buffer, containing 50 mM Na-phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mg/mL Lysozyme, 2x Complete (EDTA-free) and DNase, followed by cell disruption using a French press (Model: IUL Basic Z). Insoluble material is pelleted by high speed centrifugation and the supernatant is applied to a Ni-chelate chromatographic column. The column is washed with several bed volumes of washing buffer (50 mM Na-phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole. Finally, bound antigen is isolated using an elution buffer containing 50 mM Na-phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl with a linear gradient of 20 to 500 mM imidazole.\n\n\n \n\n\nProduction of monoclonal antibodies against the S100A12\n\n\n\n\n\n\na) Immunization of mice\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n12 week old A/J mice are initially immunized intraperitoneally with 100 µg S100A12. This is followed after 6 weeks by two further intraperitoneal immunizations at monthly intervals. In this process each mouse is administered 100 µg S100A12 adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide and 10\n9\n germs of \nBordetella pertussis.\n Subsequently the last two immunizations are carried out intravenously on the 3rd and 2nd day before fusion using 100 µg S100A12 in PBS buffer for each.\n\n\n \n\n\nb) Fusion and cloning\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSpleen cells of the mice immunized according to a) are fused with myeloma cells according to \nGalfre, G., and Milstein, C., Methods in Enzymology 73 (1981) 3-46\n. In this process ca. 1*10\n8\n spleen cells of the immunized mouse are mixed with 2x10\n7\n myeloma cells (P3X63-Ag8-653, ATCC CRL1580) and centrifuged (10 min at 300 x g and 4°C.). The cells are then washed once with RPMI 1640 medium without fetal calf serum (FCS) and centrifuged again at 400 x g in a 50 ml conical tube. The supernatant is discarded, the cell sediment is gently loosened by tapping, 1 ml PEG (molecular weight 4,000, Merck, Darmstadt) is added and mixed by pipetting. After 1 min in a water-bath at 37°C., 5 ml RPMI 1640 without FCS is added drop-wise at room temperature within a period of 4-5 min. Afterwards 5 ml RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS is added drop-wise within ca. 1 min, mixed thoroughly, filled to 50 ml with medium (RPMI 1640+10% FCS) and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 400 x g and 4°C. The sedimented cells are taken up in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS and sown in hypoxanthine-azaserine selection medium (100 mmol/l hypoxanthine, 1 µg/ml azaserine in RPMI 1640+10% FCS). Interleukin 6 at 100 U/ml is added to the medium as a growth factor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter ca. 10 days the primary cultures are tested for specific antibody. S100A12-positive primary cultures are cloned in 96-well cell culture plates by means of a fluorescence activated cell sorter. In this process again interleukin 6 at 100 U/ml is added to the medium as a growth additive.\n\n\n \n\n\nc) Immunoglobulin isolation from the cell culture supernatants\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe hybridoma cells obtained are sown at a density of 1x10\n5\n cells per ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS and proliferated for 7 days in a fermenter (Thermodux Co., Wertheim/Main, Model MCS-104XL, Order No. 144-050). On average concentrations of 100 µg monoclonal antibody per ml are obtained in the culture supernatant. Purification of this antibody from the culture supernatant is carried out by conventional methods in protein chemistry (e.g. according to \nBruck, C., et al., Methods in Enzymology 121 (1986) 587-596\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nGeneration of polyclonal antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\na) Immunization\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor immunization, a fresh emulsion of the protein solution (100 µg/ml protein S100A12) and complete Freund's adjuvant at the ratio of 1:1 is prepared. Each rabbit is immunized with 1 ml of the emulsion at \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 1, 7, 14 and 30, 60 and 90. Blood is drawn and resulting anti-S100A12 serum used for further experiments as described in examples 3 and 4.\n\n\n \n\n\nb) Purification of IgG (immunoglobulin G) from rabbit serum by sequential precipitation with caprylic acid and ammonium sulfate\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOne volume of rabbit serum is diluted with 4 volumes of acetate buffer (60 mM, pH 4.0). The pH is adjusted to 4.5 with 2 M Tris-base. Caprylic acid (25 µl/ml of diluted sample) is added drop-wise under vigorous stirring. After 30 min the sample is centrifuged (13,000 x g, 30 min, 4°C), the pellet discarded and the supernatant collected. The pH of the supernatant is adjusted to 7.5 by the addition of 2 M Tris-base and filtered (0.2 µm).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe immunoglobulin in the supernatant is precipitated under vigorous stirring by the drop-wise addition of a 4 M ammonium sulfate solution to a final concentration of 2 M. The precipitated immunoglobulins are collected by centrifugation (8,000 x g, 15 min, 4°C).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe supernatant is discarded.

After incubation for 1 h, the membranes are washed 6 times in PBS/0.05% Tween-20. For detection of the bound POD-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody, the membrane is incubated with the Lumi-Light\nPLUS\n Western Blotting Substrate (Order-No. 2015196, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and exposed to an autoradiographic film.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen tumor and normal tissue derived from four individuals diagnosed with CRC is blotted as described, high expression of S100A12 protein is detected in tumor tissue while no or much less S100A12, respectively, is found in normal tissue (\nFigure 1\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing of stool specimen\n\n\n\n\n\n\na) Detergent extraction\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAbout 1 g of stool per sample is collected by the patients in a special sampling device from Sarstedt, Germany, Order-No. 80.623.022, frozen and stored at -70°C. For analysis, the stool samples are thawed, approximately 100 mg of stool sample are diluted tenfold with a phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with Mini Complete EDTA-free, a protease inhibitor cocktail from Roche, Germany (order-no.: 11 873 580):\n\n \n \n \n \nNa\n2\nHPO\n4\n \n \n53.4 mM\n \n \n \nKH\n2\nPO\n4\n \n \n12.3 mM\n \n \n \nNaN\n3\n \n \n0.1 %\n \n \n \nNa\n2\nEDTA\n \n1.07 mM\n \n \n \nChicken albumen\n \n1.0 %\n \n \n \nNonidet P-40\n \n0.5 %\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe samples are incubated for 1 h at room temperature with continuous shaking and for one more hour without shaking at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 15 min at 3.000 x g, the supernatant is pipetted off and filtered using a membrane filter with a pore size of 5 µm. The samples are aliquoted and stored at -70 °C. An aliquot of this processed stool sample is used for quantitation of S100A12 by ELISA.\n\n\n \n\n\nb) Urea extraction\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo improve the measurement of S100A12 and other markers of interest in stool samples an \"optimized extraction buffer\" is used. For the processing of the stool samples the extraction buffer is freshly prepared by adding a protease inhibitor cocktail (Mini Complete EDTA-free, Roche, Germany) to the following buffer:\n\n \n \n \n \nTRIS\n \n0.10 mol/l, pH 8.0\n \n \n \nCitric acid\n \n0.10 mol/l\n \n \n \nUrea\n \n1.0 mol/l\n \n \n \nCaCl\n2\n \n \n0.01 mol/l\n \n \n \nBSA\n \n0.50 %\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stool samples are thawed and 50 - 100 mg of each sample are transferred to a fecal sample preparation kit (cat.-no.: 10745804 Roche, Germany). Optimized extraction buffer is added according to the weight of the stool samples to give a 50-fold dilution. The samples are vigorously mixed on an orbital shaker for 30 minutes, transferred to a 10 ml tube (Sarstedt, Germany) and centrifuged at 1200 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant is filtered using a 5 µm cut-off filter (Ultrafree\n®\n-CL, Millipore, Germany), aliquoted and stored for further analysis at -70 °C. These stool extracts are suitable for all biomarkers of interest in this study.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nELISA for the measurement of S100A12 in human stool specimen\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA sandwich ELISA is developed for the determination of S100A12 from stool. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies are produced by immunization with recombinant full length S100A12 expressed in E. coli. The purified IgG fraction of the antisera is biotinylated or digoxigenylated to used to establish a sandwich ELISA using 96-well streptavidin plates (Streptawell, HighBind, Roche, Germany). Stool extracts are diluted 1:25 in sample dilution buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1.5 % KCL, 0.3 % Triton X-100, 0.2 % Casein, 2 % sucrose) and 50 µl of sample or standard are transferred to each well. Subsequently the formation of the antigen-antibody complex is started by adding 50 µl of an antibody mixture containing 0.5 µg/ml biotinylated polyclonal antibody PAB<S100A12>-Bi and 0.5 µg/ml digoxigenylated polyclonal antibody PAB<S100A12>-Dig in assay buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1 % bovine IgG, 0.9 % NaCl, 0.5 % Thesit, 1 % PEG 40.000, 0.1% bovine IgG, 0.025% bovine gamma globulin acetylated). The plates are incubated for 60 minutes, washed three times with 350 µl washing buffer per well (100 mM PBS, pH 7.4, 0.05% TWEEN-20). Thereafter 100 µl of 25 mU/ml MAB<Dig>-POD conjugate (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) per well are added and incubated for another 60 minutes. After three times washing with 350 µl washing buffer per well, 100 µl ABTS solution (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) per well are added and the plates incubated for 60 minutes. The absorbance is measured at 405/620 nm using an ELISA reader (SLT.Spectra II). Recombinant full-length S100A12 is used for calibration.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyte stability in urea extract\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nS100A12 appears to be more stable than hemoglobin in stool extracts prepared using the extraction method described in 4b. When stool extracts are stored for 1 or 3 days at room temperature the average recovery for S100A12 is higher and appears to show less scatter than the average recovery of hemoglobin. Of the 20 samples used to assess the stability two are hemoglobin negative:\n\n \n \n \nTable 4:\n Recovery after temperature stress\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nN\n \n \n \nConcentration range of samples\n \n \n \nRecovery after 1 d RT\n \n \n \nRecovery after 3 d RT\n \n \n \n \n \nS100A12\n \n20\n \n21-67,663 ng/g\n \n87 % (± 15 %)\n \n73 % (± 20 %)\n \n \n \n \nHemoglobin\n \n \n18\n \n0.32 - 10,364 µg/g\n \n79 % (± 23 %)\n \n59 % (± 30 %)\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical utility of S100A12 in colorectal cancer\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe clinical utility of S100A12 is assessed by analyzing stool samples obtained from well-characterized patient cohorts. For each patient two stool samples from the same bowel movement are measured and the concentrations are analyzed. The correlation of both concentrations is assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient revealing a close correlation. To improve the sensitivity of the assay the maximum concentration measured in one of the two paired samples is used for further analysis. The diagnostic value of S100A12 is evaluated by ROC analysis according to Zweig et al (supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stool samples of the first two study populations are extracted according to Example 4a. For dilution phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4, 1.0 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1.2 mM nitrilotriacetic acid, 0.1 % bovine serum albumin is used. The stool samples of the third study population are extracted according to Example 4b and diluted with the sample dilution buffer as given in Example 5. Despite different extraction procedures, the ELISA procedure used for the measurement of S100A12 is identical for all patient populations (cf. Example 5).\n\n\n \n\n\nFirst study population:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nStool samples from 18 CRC-free patients, 10 patients diagnosed as adenoma positive by colonoscopy, and 23 patients diagnosed with progressed CRC classified as UICC stages III and IV are obtained. S100A12 is measured as described above in a stool sample obtained from each of these individuals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nROC-analysis is performed according to Zweig, M. H., and Campbell, \nsupra.\n Discriminatory power for differentiating patients in the CRC group from healthy individuals as measured by the area under the curve is found to be 97 % for CRC vs. healthy controls (\nFigure 2\n), 85 % for CRC + adenoma vs. healthy controls and 57 % for adenoma vs. healthy controls, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe positive effect of the presence of Ca\n2+\n-ions on the determination of S100A12 from stool is illustrated in \nFigure 3\n. When the stool extracts are diluted in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4, 0.1 % bovine serum albumin in the absence of both CaCl\n2\n and nitrilotriacetic acid lower concentrations of S100A12 are detectable (\nFigure 3a\n) as compared to the S100A12 concentrations measured in the presence of CaCl\n2\n and nitrilotriacetic acid (\nFigure 3b\n). The smaller dynamic range of the ELISA in the absence of Ca\n2+\n leads also to a reduced AUC of the ROC plot of 94 % for CRC vs. healthy controls while with the improved buffer system an AUC of 97 % is observed. If CRC + adenoma vs. healthy controls is considered the AUC is 81 % without Ca\n2+\n and 85 % in the presence of CaCl\n2\n and nitrilotriacetic acid, respectively.\n\n\n \nSecond, enlarged, study population:\n\n\n \n \n \nStool samples are obtained from 10 patients diagnosed as adenoma positive by colonoscopy, 50 patients diagnosed as CRC (9 classified as UICC stage I; 4 classified as UICC stage II; 21 classified as UICC stage III; 13 classified as UICC stage IV, 2 classified as UICC stage I to III, i.e. not IV; and 1 CRC without staging) and 50 controls (7 from patients with other GI-disease, i.e. not CRC; 16 from patients with diverticulosis; 8 from donors classified as GI-healthy; and 19 from patients suffering from hemorrhoids). S100A12 is measured as described above in a stool sample obtained from each of these individuals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nROC-analysis is performed according to Zweig, M. H., and Campbell, \nsupra.\n Discriminatory power for differentiating patients in the CRC group from healthy individuals as measured by the area under the curve is found to be 90 % for CRC vs. controls, 86 % for CRC + adenoma vs. healthy controls and 66 % for adenoma vs. healthy controls, respectively. This indicates that even the early UICC stages are detected if S100A12 is measured from a stool sample.\n\n\n \n\n\nThird study population\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nS100A12 is measured in a more extensive, third study population (for patient characteristics cf.: Table 5). A high number of clinically well-characterized stool samples is prospectively collected in the frame-work of multi-center study. The patients (undergoing a colonoscopy) for the control collective are recruited at gastroenterology units and representing an average-risk screening population. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and with any kind of adenoma are excluded from the control collective. Due to the low prevalence of colorectal cancer patients in a screening population, the samples from cancer patients are collected at different surgery units. The diagnosis of colorectal cancer is confirmed by a physician also providing the pathological staging for each cancer patient. To assess any bias that might be introduced by the common diagnostic work-up of patients by a guaiac-based FOBT prescreening a sub-collective without prior guaiac-based FOBT is also collected. All patients that are detected due to visible rectal bleeding are excluded from this sub-collective as well, because these would introduce a bias to the advantage of hemoglobin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStool samples are obtained from 252 control individuals. Of these 135 are confirmed by colonoscopy to be GI-healthy, while the remaining control samples cover several relevant GI-diseases. The CRC population includes 186 CRC samples from UICC stages I - IV (Table 6). For 38 CRC patients the exact staging is not known. Therefore the CRC patients with a defined UICC-stage in Table 6 do not sum-up to a total of 186 patients. In total 101 CRC patients without pre-screening by FOBT are evaluated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nS100A12 is measured as described above in a stool sample obtained from each of these individuals. ROC-analysis is performed according to Zweig, W. H., and Campbell, \nsupra.\n Discriminatory power for differentiating patients in the CRC group from control individuals as measured by the area under the curve (Table 6) is found to be 94 % for CRC vs. all controls and as well 94 % for CRC without FOBT pre-screening vs. controls. Grouping the CRC patients by disease stage reveals an area under the curve of 90 % for UICC-stage I and 96 - 97 % for UICC-stages II - IV. No evidence for a bias by FOBT pre-screening is detected since the area under the curve of these patients is identical to the area under the curve of the total CRC population.\n\n \n \n \nTable 5:\n Patient characteristics of the third study population\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal number\n \n \n \nAge (year)\n \n \n \nGender (female/male)\n \n \n \n \n \nControls\n \n252\n \n63,0 +/- 8,0\n \n151/101\n \n \n \n- Healthy Controls (no evidence of any bowel disease)\n \n132\n \n62,3 +/- 6,8\n \n81/51\n \n \n \n- Hemorrhoids\n \n28\n \n60,1 +/- 7,1\n \n13/15\n \n \n \n- Diverticulosis\n \n73\n \n64,7 +/- 9,5\n \n46/27\n \n \n \n- Hyplastic polyps\n \n14\n \n67,9 +/- 9,9\n \n8/6\n \n \n \n- Other GI diseases\n \n5\n \n59,2 +/- 6,7\n \n3/2\n \n \n \nCRC (all samples)\n \n186\n \n66.1 +/- 11.9\n \n93/93\n \n \n \nCRC (subcollective w/o blood/FOBT)\n \n101\n \n68,4 +/- 11,5\n \n48/53\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nTable 6:\n ROC analysis of a third study population\n \n \n \n \n \nSample panel\n \n \n \nN\n \n \n \nAUC %\n \n \n \n \n \nCRC samples all\n \n186\n \n94\n \n \n \nCRC samples w/o blood/FOBT\n \n101\n \n94\n \n \n \nUICC stage I\n \n39\n \n90\n \n \n \nUICC stage II\n \n38\n \n97\n \n \n \nUICC stage III\n \n42\n \n96\n \n \n \n \nUICC stage IV\n \n \n29\n \n97\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombinations of S100A12 with other stool markers\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCombinations of S100A12 with other biomarkers from stool extracts are evaluated. The markers hemoglobin, the hetero-complex of hemoglobin with haptoglobin, Calprotectin, Time-1, M2-PK and CEA are measured using commercial ELISAs. Assays for measurement of hemoglobin, hemoglobin/ haptoglobin and calprotectin are obtained from R-Biopharm, Germany. The Calpro Calprotectin ELISA is manufactured by Calpro SA, Norway, and is marketed outside of Germany as PhiCal™ Test. The assay for measurement of CEA is obtained from Roche Diagnostics, Germany. The assay for M2-PK is supplied by Schebo Biotech, Germany, and the assay for TIMP-1 by R&D Systems, USA, respectively. While some of the assays are intended for measurements in stool extracts, for two assays, namely CEA and TIMP-1, stool is not a commonly used sample material. Hence, the assays have to be adjusted to the measurement of the corresponding analyte in a sample representing an extracted stool specimen. The samples (stool extracts) are prediluted 20-fold for CEA determinations, but otherwise the assay is run according to the manufacturers recommendations. Similarly the samples are prediluted 3-fold for the measurement of TIMP-1 without changing the assay procedure itself.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo test if a marker combination will improve the diagnosis of CRC, the markers are combined by Bayes Logistic Regression (BLR). In the BLR algorithm for the evaluation of marker combinations a Gaussian prior is used and implemented in the BBR-Software of Alexander Genkin, David D. Lewis, and David Madigan (Large-scale Bayesian logistic regression for text categorization. Technometrics,). The following settings are used: no automatic feature selection, prior variance fixed at 0.05, no threshold-tuning, and input standardization by normalization. For the numerical process the default settings with a convergence threshold of 0.0005, 1000 iterations and no-accuracy-mode are retained unchanged. The results with the basic algorithm get evaluated by 100 runs in a Monte-Carlo cross-validation design. In each run, two-third of all cases and controls, respectively, are selected as training set via the Matlab\n®\n R2006a in-built function randsample with starting value 19022007 for the default random number generator. The basic algorithm is applied on the training set to generate a diagnostic rule. A threshold on the estimated posterior case-probabilities is determined on the controls of the training set to achieve a specificity of 95% or 98%, respectively. The diagnostic rule is then applied to the other third of the data to estimate sensitivity and specificity at the given threshold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo avoid any bias for hemoglobin or hemoglobin / haptoglobin only the 101 CRC patients without prior FOBT prescreening are used in the assessment. For a screening assay not only the AUC of the ROC plot is relevant. A quite critical requirement in a screening setting is a good enough sensitivity at a high specificity. High specificity is crucial because a low specificity will cause a high number of false positive results accompanied by unnecessary follow-up procedures and distress for the patients. Table 7 summarizes the AUC values of the evaluation as well as the sensitivities at a preset specificity of 95% and 98%, respectively. When some of the individual markers measured are combined by BLR the AUC values for the diagnosis of CRC are very similar within the range of +/- 1%. On the other hand overall sensitivity in detection of CRC can be significantly improved by combination of S100A12 with other markers, particularly at a specificity level of 98%. While S100A12 alone has a sensitivity of 67%, the marker combination including the two markers S100A12 and the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex exhibits a sensitivity of 79% and the best marker combination, including three markers, S100A12, hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex and TIMP-1, shows a further increase to 82% in sensitivity at the same high level of specificity. These marker combinations are considered very important in order to detect CRC, especially CRC at early stages. As obvious from Table 7, particularly a colorectal cancer at stage I is detected at a much higher rate by use of a marker combination. Use of the marker S100A12 is key to the improved ROC obtained with these marker combinations.\n\n \n \n \nTable 7:\n Marker combinations for the detection of CRC\n \n \n \n \nMarker combination\n \nN\n \nS100A12\n \nS100A12 and Hb-Hp\n \nS100A12 and Hb\n \nS100A12 and TIMP-1\n \nS100A12 and calprotectin\n \nS100A12 and M2-PK\n \nS100A12 and CEA\n \n \n \n \nAUC %\n \n101\n \n95\n \n96\n \n96\n \n94\n \n94\n \n95\n \n94\n \n \n \nSensitivity at 95 % Spec.\n \n101\n \n82\n \n88\n \n88\n \n79\n \n76\n \n82\n \n82\n \n \n \nSensitivity at 98 % Spec.\n \n101\n \n67\n \n79\n \n76\n \n73\n \n67\n \n73\n \n67\n \n \n \nUICCI Sensitivity at 98 % Spec\n \n22\n \n32\n \n55\n \n55\n \n45\n \n \n \n \n \nUICC II Sensitivity at 98 % Spec\n \n27\n \n81\n \n81\n \n85\n \n85\n \n \n \nUICC III Sensitivity at 98 % Spec\n \n28\n \n71\n \n79\n \n79\n \n79\n \n \n \nUICC IV Sensitivity at 98 % Spec\n \n24\n \n71\n \n87\n \n87\n \n75\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nSEQUENCE LISTING\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n<110> Roche Diagnostics GmbH\n\nF.

Description\n\n\n\n\n CATECHOLAMINE DERIVATIVES AND PRODRUGS THEREOF\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nField of the invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to novel catecholamines and catecholamine derivatives, to processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy. Further, the compounds of the invention may be useful as PET ligands.\n\n\nBackground art\n\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease are becoming more prevalent with the aging population. One particular neurodegenerative disease, which typically has its onset between the ages of 50 and 80 years of age, is Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is a disorder of the brain, which is characterized by tremor and difficulty with walking, movement, and coordination.\n\n\nDopamine (DA) is a chemical neurotransmitter, which is utilized by brain cells to transmit impulses to control or modulate peripheral muscle movement. PD is believed to be caused by a progressive deterioration of DA-containing neurons in the substantia nigra zona compacta of the brain. The degeneration of the DA-containing neurons results in reduced amounts of DA in the brain. This process is thought to disturb the nerve cell function such that impulses are not transmitted properly, resulting in a loss of muscle control and function.\n\n\nCurrently, there is no cure for PD. Treatments are typically aimed at controlling the PD symptoms, primarily by replacing the DA with either (levo)-3,4-dihydroxy phenylalanine (L- DOPA) which is metabolized to DA, or by administering chemical agents that stimulate the DA receptors. These receptors fall into two broad classes, Dl -type and D2-type receptors. The former is divided into Dl and D5 receptors, while the D2 receptor family consists of D2, D3, and D4 receptors. \n\n Certain hydroxylated (phenols or catechols) phenylethylamines (as such or forming part of a semirigid/rigid ring system) are known to possess dopaminergic activity at least in animal models. However, their clinical use is limited because they have low or no oral bioavailability, most likely due to their high first-pass metabolism. However, Apomorphine, which belongs to this class of compounds, is used clinically in PD therapy albeit with a non- oral delivery (typically intermittent subcutaneous administration or daytime continuous infusion). Several clinical studies are ongoing with alternative delivery strategies for Apomorphine therapy in PD such as intranasal and sublingual formulations. However these efforts are yet to result in an option for the clinical treatment of PD.\n\n\nDirect DA receptor agonists are able to activate the DA autoreceptors as well as the postsynaptic DA receptors. The effects of autoreceptor stimulation appear to predominate when e.g. Apomorphine is administered at low doses, whereas at higher doses the attenuation of DA transmission is outweighed by the enhancement of postsynaptic receptor stimulation. The antipsychotic effects in man of low doses of e.g. Apomorphine are likely due to the autoreceptor stimulation [for a discussion of clinical data, see: Tamminga; J. Neurol. Trans., 109(3), 411 (2002)].\n\n\nL-DOPA is an efficacious PD drug (a prodrug of dopamine) with a poor PK profile leading to dyskinesia and other response fluctuations. Selective D2-agonists (e.g. Pramipexole) give less dyskinesia, but lack efficacy in late PD and eventually need complementation or replacement with L-DOPA. L-DOPA and Apomorphine are currently the most efficacious PD drugs and they stimulate both Dl and D2 receptors.\n\n\nAs mentioned previously, the poor oral bioavailability of catecholamines has prevented their clinical use as oral drugs. The related phenolic amines have similar poor oral bioavailability limiting their clinical use as orally active drugs. However, Rotigotine, which belongs to this class of compounds, was recently introduced as a new PD drug based on a transdermal delivery. For Apomorphine, animal studies have shown that transdermal delivery or via implants may provide possible forms of administration. However, when the delivery of Apomorphine from implants was studied in monkeys [F. Bibbiani, L. C. Constantini, R. Patel, T.N. Chase Experimental Neurology 2005, 192, 73] it was found that in most cases the \n\n animals had to be treated with the immunosuppressant Dexamethasone to prevent local irritation and other complications following the implantation surgery. Transdermal delivery of Apomorphine has also been associated with local skin irritation and coloration.\n\n\nApart from PD, other diseases in which an increase in dopaminergic turnover may be beneficial are geriatrics, for preventing bradykinesia and depression and in the improvement of mental functions including various aspects of cognition as discussed above. It can have a positive effect in depressed patients, and it can be used in obesity as an anorectic agent. It can improve minimal brain dysfunction (MBD), narcolepsy, and potentially the negative, the positive as well as the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) are alternative indications, which are clinically treated with DA-agonists. In addition, impotence and erectile dysfunction are also likely to be improved by treatment with DA-agonists. Thus, improvement of sexual functions in both women and men is another possible indication for treatment with DA-agonists since erectile dysfunction (impotence in men) and sexual stimulation in e.g. menopausal women (stimulation of vaginal lubrication and erection of clitoris) potentially can be achieved via DA-receptor stimulation. In this context, it is noteworthy that Apomorphine when given sublingually is used clinically to improve erectile dysfunction. Clinical studies of L-DOPA and the D2 agonist Pramipexole therapy in Huntington's disease have shown promising results; thus treatment of Huntington's disease is another potential application of the compounds of the invention. DA is involved in regulation of the cardiovascular and renal systems, and accordingly, renal failure and hypertension can be considered alternative indications for the compounds of the invention.\n\n\nAn alternative to the non-oral formulations of the catecholamines involves the use of a prodrug. A problem associated with the development of such compounds for clinical use is the difficulties associated with predicting conversion to the catecholamine itself in humans. Various ester prodrugs of catecholamines have been reported in the literature such as enterically coated NPA esters for duodenal delivery [see eg. Wikstrom, Dijkstra, Cremers, Ivo; WO 02100377], and the Dl -like agonist Adrogolide [ABT-431; DAS-431, a diacetyl prodrug of A-86929]. Adrogolide undergoes a high hepatic first-pass metabolism in man after oral dosing and, as a result, has a low oral bioavailability (app. 4%). In PD patients, \n\n intravenous (IV) Adrogolide has antiparkinson efficacy comparable to that of L-DOPA [Giardina, Williams; CNS Drug Reviews, 7, 305 (2001)]. An alternative approach involves the 'masking' of the two hydroxyl groups in the catechol as the corresponding methylene-di- oxy (MDO) acetal, as the acetal derived from other aldehydes than formaldehyde, or as the ketal derived from various ketones. This prodrug principle has been reported for the Aporphines more than 20 years ago [Baldessarini, Ram, Neumeyer; Neuroropharmacology, 21(10), 953 (1982)]. Of these potential prodrugs to Apomorphine and related compounds, only that derived from N-n-propyl Apomorphine (NPA) and formaldehyde showed significant efficacy in animal models of PD. Over the following -25 years, these findings have not lead to a PD drug based on the MDO-masked Apoporphines or related compounds.\n\n\nDespite the long-standing interest in the field, there is evidently still an unmet need as regards developing efficient, well-tolerated and orally active drugs for the treatment of PD. A mixed Dl-like/D2-like agonist giving continuous dopaminergic stimulation may fulfill such unmet needs.\n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to novel catecholamine derivatives, which the inventors have found may offer suitable alternatives to current marketed treatments of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD and Huntington's disease and to the treatment of other indications discussed herein, such as eg. dyskinetic disorders, cognitive impairment and restless legs syndrome (RLS), and to compounds that are in vivo metabolizable prodrugs hereof.\n\n\nCognitive impairment can be experienced in several patients groups, e.g. schizophrenic, depressive or psychotic patients and patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, anxiety, age associated memory impairment, Alzheimer's Disease or post-traumatic stress disorder and patients taking benzodiazepines or tricyclic antidepressants and in a range of neurodegenerative diseases in addition to Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease. The phrase \"cognitive impairment\" refers to the difficulties with attention, learning, memory and executive function (relevant reactions to external stimuli). These can include: deficits in \n\n attention, disorganized thinking, slow thinking, difficulty in understanding, poor concentration, impairment of problem solving, poor memory, difficulty in expressing thoughts and/or difficulty in integrating thoughts, feelings and behaviour and extinction of irrelevant thoughts as well as attention and vigilance, verbal learning and memory, visual learning and memory, speed of processing and social cognition.\n\n\nThe objective of the present invention is to provide novel compounds, which are both potent dopamine Dl -like and D2-like agonists, and which may be used in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases\n\n\nA further objective of the present invention is to provide novel compounds for oral administration in the treatment of PD and other diseases or disorders, which responds favourably to an increased dopaminergic turnover.\n\n\nPET (positron emission tomography) analysis is an important tool in the diagnosis of PD. Some of the compounds of the invention have potential applications as PET ligands for imaging studies of the DA-receptors or as intermediates for the preparation of such ligands, which may, for example, be applied in receptor localization studies as well as for the determination of receptor occupancy determination for compounds with affinities for the DA receptors. A further objective is therefore to provide radiolabeled compounds of the present invention, which are considered to be valuable PET ligands.\n\n\nFurther objectives of the invention will become apparent upon reading the present specification. \n\n\n\n\nAccordingly, in one aspect the present invention relates to compounds of formula I:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n• wherein n = O, 1 • Ri and R\n2\n are independently selected from hydrogen, C\n1-6\n alkanoyl, phenylacetyl or benzoyl, or wherein Ri and R\n2\n are fused and form a methylene (CH\n2\n) group, a carbonyl (C=O) group, or an oxalyl (O=C-C=O) group\n\n\n• R\n3\n is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, cyclo- propyl, cyc/o-butyl, allyl, propargyl, hydroxyethyl, 3-fiuoropropyl and 2-fluoroethyl\n\n\nand addition salts thereof with pharmaceutically acceptable acids, provided that the compound is not one of the following racemates:\n\n\n• Racemic-l^^^^a^lOJOa-octahydro-benzofgtøuinoline-όJ-diol\n\n\n• Racemic- 1 -methyl- 1 ,2,3 ,4,4a,5 ,10,10a-octahydro-benzo[g]quinoline-6,7-diol • Racemic- 1 -ethyl- 1 ,2,3,4,4a,5 ,10,10a-octahydro-benzo[g]quinoline-6,7-diol\n\n\n• Racemic- 1 -n-propyl- 1 ,2,3 ,4,4a,5, 10, 10a-octahydro-benzo[g]quinoline-6,7-diol\n\n\nThe C i-6 alkanoyl group means a straight-chain or branched-chain alkanoyl group containing from 1 to six carbon atoms, examples of which include a formyl group, an acetyl group, a pivaloyl group, and the like.\n\n\nIn a particular embodiment, the invention relates to compounds of formula I in the form of a substantially pure single enantiomer or a single diastereomer.\n\n\nIn another particular embodiment, the invention relates to compounds of formula I in the form of a mixture of enantiomers, a mixture of diastereomers, or a substantially pure polymorph. \n\n In a particular embodiment, the invention relates to compounds of Formula I which have trans-fused ring systems.

In another embodiment of the invention the condition is associated with Parkinson's Disease. In another embodiment of the invention the condition is associated with dementia, such as AIDS dementia. In another embodiment of the invention the condition is associated with an anxiety disorder. In another embodiment of the invention the condition is associated with age associated memory impairment. In another embodiment of the invention the condition is associated with depression, including major depression, in particular in elderly. In another embodiment of the invention the condition is associated with the use of benzodiazepines. In another embodiment of the invention the condition is associated with the use of tricyclic antidepressants. In another embodiment of the invention the condition is associated with Alzheimer's Disease. In another embodiment of the invention the condition is associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In another embodiment of the invention the condition is associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). \n\n In a further embodiment the present invention relates to the use of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt thereof for the treatment of dyskinesias in a mammal.\n\n\nIn another embodiment the present invention relates to the use of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt thereof for the treatment of a mammal suffering from depression, such as major depresion, bipolar disorder or anxiety.\n\n\nAccording to the present invention an interesting neuropharmacological difference has been found between the two trans -mantiomers of underivatized catecholamines of Formula I (Ri and R\n2\n = H), which have been prepared in enantiomerically pure form by a process of the current invention. It has thus been demonstrated that the (4aR,10aR) enantiomers are potent, dual D1/D2 agonists with EC50 values <200 nM [see the Experimental Section for a description of the in vitro assays used], whereas the (4aS,10aS) antipodes are much less potent Dl agonists, and only display moderately strong D2 agonism.\n\n\nSome of the (4aR,10aR) enantiomers of compounds of Formula I have furthermore been tested for D5 affinity and have proven to be very potent D5 agonists with EC50 values < 10 nM.\n\n\nThe racemic compounds of Formula I for which n = 1 , Ri and R\n2\n = hydrogen and R3 = hydrogen, methyl, ethyl and n-propyl have previously been disclosed [see e.g. Cannon, Lee, Beres, Goldman; J. Heterocycl. Chem., 17, 1633 (1980)], and their dopaminergic activity discussed [see e.g. Bradbury, Costall, Naylor; Neuropharmacology 23(9), 1025 (1984); Bradbury, Cannon, Costall, Naylor; Eur. J. Pharmacol. 105(1-2), 33 (1984)]. The racemic compound of Formula I for which n = 1, R\n1\n and R\n2\n = hydrogen and R3 = ethyl has been reported to stimulate both Dl and D2 receptors [Itoh, Goldman, Kebabain; Eur. J. Pharmacol., 108 (1), 99 (1985)]. However, none of these prior art documents discuss the enantioselectivity of the compounds of Formula I, or the different selectivities obtained in vitro vs. in vivo. \n\n As mentioned previously, the compound Apomorphine is currently used clinically in PD therapy. Apomorphine is a mixed Dl-like/D2-like agonist:\n\n\nApomorphine \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the compounds of the invention are tested in vitro and in vivo for their effect on Dl and D2 receptors, their pharmacological profiles are very different from that of Apomorphine (see Experimental Section for details)\n\n\nIt has been demonstrated that the D1/D2 selectivity ratio for the underivatized catecholamines of Formula I (Ri and R\n2\n = H) changes dramatically when comparing in vitro with in vivo measurements. In in vitro assays, these compounds are significantly more potent on D2 receptors than on Dl receptors (typically with a ratio of -100). However, the in vivo ratio is shifted towards a 2-10 fold selectivity.. Thus, it is evident that an extrapolation from in vitro data to the in vivo situation cannot be made for the compounds of the invention.\n\n\nAs mentioned previously, the presently available information supports the hypothesis that a Dl -like agonist (be it selective for either subtype or a mixed D1/D5 agonist) could have important applications in the treatment of cognitive impairment in e.g. psychosis, PD, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Huntington's disease. This might well be the case also for dual action D1/D2 agonists, such as the compounds of Formula I.\n\n\nIn a particular embodiment, the invention therefore relates to substantially pure (4aR,10aR) enantiomers of compounds of Formula I wherein n=l, Ri and R\n2\n are both hydrogen and R\n3\n is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, allyl, and propargyl.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention relates to substantially pure (4aR,10aR) enantiomers of compounds of Formula I wherein n=l, Ri and R\n2\n are both hydrogen and R\n3\n is n-propyl\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention relates to substantially pure (4aR,10aR) enantiomers of compounds of Formula I wherein n=l, Ri and R\n2\n are both hydrogen and R\n3\n is methyl \n\n In a separate embodiment, the invention relates to substantially pure (4aR,10aR) enantiomers of compounds of Formula I wherein n=l\n\n\nThe invention also relates to compounds of Formula I to be used as PET ligands or as intermediates therefore.

Fraction collection was performed by split-flow MS detection.\n\n\nHydrogenation reactions were performed using either a standard Parr shaker or an Endavour instrument from Argonaut. In all cases, low pressure was used (1-5 bar hydrogen pressure).\n\n\nThe term \"silica gel chromatography (EtOAc/heptane)\" has the following meaning: The compound to be purified was usually dissolved in a small amount of DCM and loaded onto a column pre-packed with silica gel and eluted using a mixture of EtOAc and heptane, either in a isocratic fashion or with a gradient such as 0-100% of EtOAc in heptane. One example of a \n\n column loaded with silica gel used is \"ISOLUTE SPE COLUMNS\" [e.g. 2Og FLASH Si 70 ml from International sorbent technology]. Alternatively, classical manual chromatographic purifications were performed using silica gel [e.g. Machery-Nagel 60 M; 0.04-0.063 mm, 230-400 mesh] with compound identification by standard TLC analysis performed on aluminium plates precoated with silica gel [e.g. Merck 60 F254]. Compounds were visualized by illumination using a UV lamp (254 nm) or by charring after dipping in a solution of ammonium molybdate (6.25 g) and cerium(IV)sulfate (2.5 g) in 10% aqueous sulphuric acid (250 mL).\n\n\nMicrowave-accelerated reactions were performed in sealed microwave reactor vials. The experiments were performed on a Smith Synthesizer from Personal Chemistry.\n\n\nThe term \"lyophilized\" refers to the freeze-drying of a material using a Christ Aplha 2-4 LSC instrument from WWR International.\n\n\nThe terms \"dried (Na\n2\nSO\n4\n)\" and \"dried (Mg\n2\nSO\n4\n)\" refers to the removal of water from organic layers by the addition of dry Na\n2\nSO\n4\n or Mg\n2\nSO\n4\n, respectively, followed by stirring for an appropriate amount of time to ensure an effective drying process. Then the solid is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is typically concentrated in vacuo (see below).\n\n\nThe term \"concentrated in vacuo\n'\n\" has the following meaning: The volatiles were removed from the mixture using a standard rotary evaporator at reduced pressure. The term \"dried in vacuo at 40 \n0\nC\" refers to the use of a standard vacuum oven heated to 40 \n0\nC connected to an oil pump. The term \"dried in vacuo\"\" refers to a drying process in which the material to be dried is placed in a flask connected directly to an oil pump for a sufficient period of time to remove volatile components.\n\n\nX-ray crystal structure determinations were performed as follows. The crystal of the compounds was cooled to 120 K using a Cryostream nitrogen gas cooler system. The data were collected on a Siemens SMART Platform diffractometer with a CCD area sensitive detector. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least- squares against F of all data. The hydrogen atoms in the structures could be found in the \n\n electron density difference maps. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. All the hydrogen atoms were at calculated positions using a riding model with O-H=0.84, C-H = 0.99-1.00, N-H = 0.92-0.93 A. For all hydrogen atoms the thermal parameters were fixed [CZ(H) = 1.2 U for attached atom]. The Flack x-parameters are in the range 0.0(I)-0.05(1), indicating that the absolute structures are correct. Programs used for data collection, data reduction and absorption were SMART, SAINT and SADABS [cf. \"SMART and SAINT, Area Detector Control and Integration Software\", Version 5.054,Bruker Analytical X-Ray Instruments Inc., Madison, USA (1998), Sheldrick \"SADABS, Program for Empirical Correction of Area Detector Data\" Version 2.03, University of Gottingen, Germany (2001)]. The program SHELXTL [cf. Sheldrick \"SHELXTL, Structure Determination Programs\", Version 6.12, Bruker Analytical X-Ray Instruments Inc., Madison, USA (2001)] was used to solve the structures and for molecular graphics.\n\n\nGeneral Synthetic methods for Markush structures Ia and Ib. \n\n\n\n\n\nMarkush Ia Markush Ib\n\n\nMarkush structure Ia\n\n\n \n\n Starting from intermediate I, whose synthesis is described herein, condensation with primary amine R3NH2 gives Markush Ia-I under the conditions herein for the synthesis of compound 25 from intermediate I. Reduction of Markush Ia-I with LAH provides Markush la-2 e.g. under the conditions herein for the synthesis of compounds 13 and 14. After separation of the cisltrans mixture, either diastereomer can be treated with 48% HBr or a related reagent to cleave the methoxy groups to furnish Markush Ia e.g. under the conditions described herein for the synthesis of example IaI. Further reaction of Markush Ia with CH\n2\nClBr or a related reagent in the presence of base to give Markush Ia-MDO e.g. under the conditions described herein for the synthesis of example 3b 1. The resulting Markush Ia-MDO can be converted back to Markush Ia by treatment with BCl\n3\n/(n-Butyl)\n4\nNI or a related reagent. Markush Ia can be converted to Markush la-di-ester by treatment with the appropriate acid chloride(s) in TFA to give Markush la-di-ester e.g. as described herein for the synthesis of example 4al.

As for the trans-series described above, treatment with e.g. BCl\n3\n/(n-Butyl)\n4\nNI can be used to give czs-Markush Ib, which can be converted back to czs-Markush Ib-MDO by reaction with CH\n2\nClBr or a related reagent in the presence of base to give czs-Markush Ib-MDO e.g. under the conditions described herein for the synthesis of example 3b 1. Treatment of czs-Markush Ib material with the appropriate acid chloride(s) in TFA can be used to prepare czs-Markush lb-di-ester e.g. as described herein for the synthesis of example 4al. These di-esters can be hydro lyzed to the parent catecholamines czs-Markush Ib. Reduction of czs-Markush lb-8 can be used to prepare czs-Markush Ib-MDO analogs in which R\n3\n can be defined as CH\n2\nR\n4\n as described herein.\n\n\nUseful intermediates for the preparation of compounds of the invention\n\n\nThe following intermediates are useful in the preparation of the compounds of the invention: \n\n \n\n\n intermediate I intermediate Il intermediate III example 3a1 (racemate) (4aR,10aR enantiomer) (4aS,10aS enantiomer) (4aR,10aR enantiomer)\n\n\nIn the following sections general synthetic methods for the preparation of the intermediates will be presented followed by specific examples.\n\n\nGeneral Procedure for preparation of benzo[fj indole catecholamines \n\n\n intermediate I (racemate)\n\n\n \n\n frans-racemate c/s-racemate\n\n\nIntermediate I, whose synthesis is described herein, is reacted with a primary amine and the resulting enamine- lactam is then reduced by alane and then sodium borohydride.

Experiments consist of determining a minimum effective dose (MED) to induce rotation for the compound in question. Once a MED has been determined, a second experiment is performed to determine the MED of the compound to overcome Nemonapride block (MEDNemonapπde). Nemonapride is a D2-like antagonist that blocks the D2-like receptor, therefore any observed rotations would be dependent upon activity at the Dl -like receptor. Finally, once the MEDNemonapπde is known a third experiment is run using the MEDNemonapπde dose and observing the effect of the Dl -like antagonist, SCH 23390 alone, the D2-like antagonist, Nemonapride alone and finally, the effect of combined treatment with SCH 23390 and Nemonapride. This third experiment confirms the activity of the compound at both receptors as either antagonist alone can only partially inhibit the rotation response induced by the test compound while the combination treatment completely blocks all rotations in the rats [Arnt, Hytell; Psychopharmacology, 85(3), 346 (1985); Sonsalla, Manzino, Heikkila; J. \n\n Pharmacol Exp. Ther., 247(1), 180 (1988)]. This model was validated using Apomorphine as the proof-of-principle compound for mixed Dl-like/D2-like agonists.\n\n\nSuperiority model Apomorphine and L-DOPA are able to reverse motility deficits in a mouse model of severe dopamine depletion. Both Apomorphine and L-DOPA stimulate Dl and D2-like dopamine receptors. Pramipexole, an agonist at D2-like receptors is ineffective in this model. Some of the compounds included herein have been tested in this model and exhibit a profile similar to Apomorphine and L-DOPA in that they are able to restore locomotion in the mice. In this way, these compounds are 'superior' to other compounds, such as Pramipexole, that target D2-like receptors only.\n\n\nDyskinesia model The dyskinetic profile of some of the compounds of the invention was studied using an animal model described in the literature [Lundblad, Andersson, Winkler, Kirik, Wierup, Cenci; Eur. J. Neurosci., 15(1), 120 (2002)]. In this paradigm some of the compounds of the invention gave less dyskinesias than L-DOPA or Apomorhine in drug-naive animals. Some of the compounds of the invention further reduced L-DOPA induced dyskinesias significantly more than was observed when shifting animals from L-DOPA to Pramipexole.\n\n\nMethods - Cell culture\n\n\nHuman D5 (hD5) expression construct was made using a modified pEXJ vector. A stable cell line expressing a promiscuous human Galphalό G protein (CHO-GaI 6) was purchased from (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The cells were cultured in HAMS F- 12 media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% FSB (foelal bovine serum), 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) at 37 °C in 5% CO\n2\n. 48h before assay, CHO-GaI 6 cells were transiently transfected with hD5 receptor DNA using a lipofectamine Plus method (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and allow to grow for 1 day in serum and P/S free media. 24h before assay, hD5 transfected CHO-GaI 6 cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well into black walled clear-base 384-well plates pretreated with poly-D-Lysine (Becton \n\n Dickinson, USA). The cells were then cultured in HAMS F-12 cell growth media containing 1.5% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) at 37 °C in 5% CO\n2\n \n\n\nMethods - Intracellular calcium mobilization assays For measurements of intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca\n2+\nJ\n1\n), the culture medium was replaced with a freshly prepared loading buffer. The loading buffer contains IX HBSS (Invitrogen), 20 mM HEPES (Sigma), 0.1% BSA (Sigma), 1.5 micro-M Fluoro-4-AM (Molecular Probes), and 2.5 mM probenecid (prepared fresh) (Sigma). The plates were incubated for Ih at 37 °C and 5% CO\n2\n and washed three times with washing buffer. The washing buffer contains the same components as the loading buffer excluding Fluo-4-AM. The cells were then placed into a fluorescence imager plate reader (FLIPR™, Molecular Devices) to monitor cell fluorescence before and after addition of various compounds.\n\n\nThe compounds of interest were diluted in washing buffer to a 4X final concentration and aliquoted into a clear round-bottom plate. The dye was excited at the 488 nm wavelength using an argon ion laser and the signal was detected using the standard 510-570 nm emission\n\n\n[Sullivan, Tucker, Dale; Methods MoI. Biol, 114, 125 (1999)]. Concentration effects curves for agonists were constructed by adding different concentrations to different wells. Relative fluorescence is measured by subtracting basal from peak fluorescence after addition of drug. The data were then collected and analyzed using the FLIPR™ software and GraphPad Prism\n\n\n4.\n\n\nAntagonist activities of compounds were assayed for their inhibition of the signal elicited by agonist ligands. Cells were pre-incubated with compounds at increasing concentrations, and then stimulated with agonists using the methods described above.\n\n\nIn vitro Hepatocyte Assay\n\n\nCryopreserved pooled male rat hepatocytes (Sprague Dawley) and pooled human hepatocytes from 10 donors (male and female) were purchased from In Vitro Technologies Inc., BA, USA. Cells were thawed at 37 \n0\nC in a water bath, live cells counted and seeded in a total of 100 micro-L in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (high glucose) with 5 mM Hepes buffer in 96 well plates, each well containing 250.000 and 500.000 cells/mL for rat and human \n\n hepatocytes, respectively. Incubations were started after 15 min of pre-incubation and stopped at time points of 0, 5, 15, 30 and 60 min for rats and at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min for human hepatocytes. Incubations were stopped by addition of an equal volumes of ice-cold acetonitrile containing 10% 1 M HCl. Following centrifugation, 20 micro-L of the supernatants were injected on a HPLC Column Atlantis dC18 3 micro-m, 150 x 2.1 mm i.d. (Waters, MA, USA). The mobile phase had the following composition: A: 5% acetonitrile, 95% H\n2\nO, 3.7 ml/1 25% aq. NH\n3\n, 1.8 mL/L formic acid. Mobile phase B: 100% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min. The gradient operated from 0% to 75 % B from 5 min to 20 min and the eluate was analyzed using a Q-TOFmicro mass spectrometer (Waters, MA, USA). Formation of the product/metabolite was confirmed by accurate mass measurements and comparison with a synthesized standard giving coinciding retention times."

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention is directed to agents with affinity for GABA\nA\n receptor, specifically to imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine compounds.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nGABA\nA\n receptor (y-aminobutyric acid\nA\n) is a pentameric protein which forms a membrane ion channel. GABA\nA\n receptor is implicated in the regulation of sedation, anxiety, muscle tone, epileptogenic activity and memory functions. These actions are due to defined subunits of GABA\nA\n receptor, particularly the α\n1\n- and α\n2\n-subunits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSedation is modulated by the α\n1\n-subunit. Zolpidem is characterized by a high affinity for the α\n1\n-receptors and its sedative and hypnotic action is mediated by these receptors \nin vivo\n. Similarly, the hypnotic action of zaleplon is also mediated by the α\n1\n-receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anxiolytic action of diazepam is mediated by the enhancement of GABAergic transmission in a population of neurons expressing the α\n2\n-receptors. This indicates that the α\n2\n-receptors are highly specific targets for the treatment of anxiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscle relaxation in diazepam is mainly mediated by α\n2\n-receptors, since these receptors exhibit a highly specific expression in spinal cord.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anticonvulsant effect of diazepam is partly due to α\n1\n-receptors. In diazepam, a memory-impairing compound, anterograde amnesia is mediated by α\n1\n-receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGABA\nA\n receptor and its α\n1\n- and α\n2\n-subunits have been widely reviewed by \nH. Möhler et al. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 300, 2-8, 2002\n); \nH. Möhler et al. (Curr. Opin. Pharmacol., 1, 22-25, 2001\n); \nU. Rudolph et al. (Nature, 401, 796-800, 1999\n); and \nD.J. Nutt et al. (Br. J. Psychiatry, 179, 390-396, 2001\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiazepam and other classical benzodiazepines are extensively used as anxiolytic agents, hypnotic agents, anticonvulsants and muscle relaxants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTheir side effects include anterograde amnesia, decrease in motor activity and potentiation of ethanol effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this context, the compounds of this invention are ligands of α\n1\n- and α\n2\n-GABA\nA\n receptor for their clinical application in sleep disorders, preferably insomnia, anxiety and epilepsy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsomnia is a highly prevalent disease. Its chronicity affects 10% of the population and 30% when transitory insomnia is computed as well. Insomnia describes the trouble in getting to sleep or staying asleep and is associated with next-day hangover effects such as weariness, lack of energy, low concentration and irritability. The social and health impact of this complaint is important and results in evident socioeconomic repercussions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacological therapy in the management of insomnia firstly included barbiturates and chloral hydrate, but these drugs elicit numerous known adverse effects, for example, overdose toxicity, metabolic induction, and enhanced dependence and tolerance. In addition, they affect the architecture of sleep by decreasing above all the duration and the number of REM sleep stages. Later, benzodiazepines meant an important therapeutic advance because of their lower toxicity, but they still showed serious problems of dependence, muscle relaxation, amnesia and rebound insomnia following discontinuation of medication.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe latest known therapeutic approach has been the introduction of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, such as pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazines (zopiclone), imidazo[1,2-a] pyridines (zolpidem) and, finally, pyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidines (zaleplon). Later, two new pyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidines, indiplon and ocinaplon, have entered into development, the latter with rather anxiolytic action. All these compounds show a rapid sleep induction and have less next-day hangover effects, lower potential for abuse and lower risk of rebound insomnia than benzodiazepines. The mechanism of action of these compounds is the alosteric activation of GABA\nA\n receptor through its binding to benzodiazepine binding site (\nC. F. P. George, The Lancet, 358, 1623-1626, 2001\n). While benzodiazepines are unspecific ligands at GABA\nA\n receptor binding site, zolpidem and zaleplon show a greater selectivity for α\n1\n-subunit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNotwithstanding that, these drugs still affect the architecture of sleep and may induce dependence in long-term treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome N-imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-3-yl-methyl-alkanamides and N-imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-3-yl-methyl-benzamides, wherein the phenyl ring from the benzamide group can be optionally substituted, have been disclosed in \n \nWO 89/01333\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are structurally related to, but distinct from the compound N,N,6-trimethyl-2-p-tolylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetamide, zolpidem, which is described in \n \nUS 4,382,938\n \n, because of their improved properties as shown in the Detailed Description of the Invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResearch for new active compounds in the management of insomnia answers an underlying health need, because even recently introduced hypnotics still affect the architecture of sleep and may induce dependence in long-term treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is therefore desirable to focus on the development of new hypnotic agents with a lower risk of side effects.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides new imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazines which are active versus GABA\nA\n and, particularly, versus its α\ni\n- and α\n2\n-subunits. Consequently, the compounds of this invention are useful in the treatment and prevention of all those diseases mediated by GABA\nA\n receptor α1- and α\n2\n-subunits. Non-limitative examples of such diseases are sleep disorders, preferably insomnia, anxiety and epilepsy. Non-limitative examples of the relevant indications of the compounds of this invention are all those diseases or conditions, such as insomnia or anesthesia, in which an induction of sleep, an induction of sedation or an induction of muscle relaxation are needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the present invention describes a novel class of compounds represented by formula (I):\n\n \n \n\nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts, polymorphs, hydrates, tautomers, solvates and stereoisomers thereof, wherein R\n1\n to R\n4\n, and Y are defined below, which are ligands of GABA\nA\n receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is another object of this invention to provide synthetic procedures for preparing the compounds of formula (I), certain intermediates thereof, as well as intermediates themselves. Novel methods of treating or preventing diseases associated with GABA\nA\n receptors modulation such as anxiety, epilepsy and sleep disorders including insomnia, and for inducing sedation-hypnosis, anesthesia, sleep and muscle relaxation by administering a therapeutically effective amount of said compounds are also within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE

\nAnother aspect of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing compounds of formula (I) as well as an imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine intermediate of formula (II):\n\n \n \n\nwherein R is methyl, R\n1\n is a methyl, chlorine, methoxy, ethoxy, thiophenoxy or 1-pyrrolidinyl group and R\n2\n is a phenyl group or a phenyl group substituted in para- position by methyl, halogen, methoxy, nitro or trifluoromethyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of general formula (I), when X is CO, can be obtained following the synthetic strategy showed in Scheme 1.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nStarting from ketoacids (III), ketoamides (IV) can be obtained by using conventional coupling conditions. These ketoamides (IV) can be brominated in α-position of the reacting carbonyl group with bromine in acetic acid, to yield the bromoketoamides (V). Finally, cyclization of aminopyridazines (VI) in acetonitrile at reflux affords the imidazopyridazines (I, X = CO).\n\nOn the other hand, if R\n3\n or R\n4\n are optionally substituted amino groups, then the molecule obtained is not an amide but an hydrazide. The synthetic pathway has to be slightly modified for that proposal (Scheme 2).\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Fischer esterification of the same ketoacid (III) is carried out with an alcohol ROH to afford the corresponding ester (VII). This ester is brominated under similar conditions as the amide (IV) described above, to yield bromoketoesters (VIII). A cyclization with aminopyridazines (VI) allows the preparation of the imidazopyridazines (II) substituted with an ester group. Finally, acylic substitution by using a substituted hydrazine in a suitable solvent at reflux provides the corresponding hydrazides (I, X = CO, R\n3\n or R\n4\n are optionally substituted amino groups). Suitable solvents to be used in this reaction are selected preferably from linear or branched alkanols (C\n1\n-C\n6\n), more preferably methanol, or mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, polymorphs, hydrates, tautomers, solvates and stereoisomers can be used for the preparation of a medicament for treating or preventing diseases associated with GABA\nA\n receptor modulation in a human or non-human mammal. More specifically, diseases associated with GABA\nA\n receptor modulation comprise diseases associated with α\n1\n-GABA\nA\n receptor modulation and/or α\n2\n-GABA\nA\n receptor modulation. It is well-known for the skill in the art which diseases associated with GABA\nA\n receptor modulation are (cf. \nKaufmann W.

The most preferred route of the present invention is the oral route. The compositions may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form, and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compound can be combined with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of the preparation desired for administration, e.g. oral or parenteral (including intravenous injections or infusions). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed. Usual pharmaceutical media include, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations (such as for example, suspensions, solutions, emulsions and elixirs); aerosols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like, in the case of oral solid preparations (such as for example, powders, capsules, and tablets) with the oral solid preparations being preferred over the oral liquid preparations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or non-aqueous techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable dosage range for use is from about 0.01 mg to about 100.00 mg total daily dose, given as a once daily administration or in divided doses if required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention have a high affinity for α\n1\n- and α\n2\n-GABA\nA\n receptors.

All these results support their use in diseases or conditions modulated by α\n1\n-and α\n2\n-GABA\nA\n receptors, such as insomnia or anesthesia, in which an induction of sleep, an induction of sedation or an induction of muscle relaxation are needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacological activity of the compounds of the present invention has been determined as shown below.\n\n\n \na) \nLigand-binding assays. Determination of the affinity of test compounds for\n α\n1\n \n- and\n α\n \n2\n \n \n-GABA\n \n \nA\n \n \nreceptor\n \n\n\n \n \n \nMale Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-250 g at the time of experiment were used. After decapitation of the animal, the cerebellum (tissue that mostly contains α\n1\n-GABA\nA\n receptor) and spinal cord (tissue that mostly contains α\n2\n-GABA\nA\n receptor) were removed. The membranes were prepared according to the method by \nJ. Lameh et al. (Prog. Neuro-Psychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry, 24, 979-991, 2000\n) and \nH. Noguchi et al. (Eur J Pharm, 434, 21-28, 2002\n) with slight modifications. Once the tissues weighed, they were suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1:40 (v/v), or sucrose 0.32 M in the case of spinal cord, homogenized and then centrifuged at 20000 g for 10 minutes at 7°C. The resulting pellet was resuspended under the same conditions and centrifuged again. The pellet was finally resuspended on a minimum volume and kept at -80°C overnight. A slight modification was used in the case of spinal cord at the first centrifugation step. Centrifugation speed was at 1000g and the supernatant was collected instead of discarded as in cerebellum. Then, supernatant was centrifuged at 20000g and resuspended twice more under the same conditions described above for cerebellum.\n\nOn the next day, the process was repeated until the final pellet was resuspended at a ratio of 1:10 (v/v)in the case of cerebellum and at a ratio of 1:5 (v/v) in the case of spinal cord.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAffinity was determined by competitive tests using radiolabeled flumazenil as ligand. The tests were performed according to the methods described by \nS. Arbilla et al. (Eur. J. Pharmacol., 130, 257-263, 1986\n); and \nY. Wu et al. (Eur. J. Pharmacol., 278, 125-132, 1995\n) using 96-well microtiter plates. The membranes containing the study receptors, flumazenil (radiolabeling at a final concentration of 1 nM) and ascending concentrations of test compounds (in a total volume of 230 µl in 50 mM [pH 7.4] Tris-HCl buffer) were incubated. Simultaneously, the membranes were only incubated with the radiolabeled flumazenil (total binding, 100%) and in the presence of an elevated concentration of unradiolabeled flumazenil (non-specific binding, % estimation of radiolabeled ligand). The reactions started on adding the radiolabeled ligand followed by incubation for 60 minutes at 4°C. At the end of the incubation period, 200 µl of reaction were transferred to a multiscreen plate (Millipore) and filtered using a vacuum manifold and then washed three times with cold test buffer. The multiscreen plates were equipped with a GF/B filter that retained the membranes containing the receptors and the radiolabeled ligand which had been bound to the receptors. After washing, the plates were left till dry. Once dried, scintillation liquid was added and left under stirring overnight. The next day the plates were counted using a Perkin-Elmer Microbeta scintillation counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor analysis of the results the percentage of specific binding for every concentration of test compound was calculated as follows: \n \n \n%\n \n \n \nspecific binding\n \n=\n \n \nX\n \n-\n \nN\n \n/\n \nT\n \n-\n \nN\n \n \n×\n \n100\n \n \n \n \n\nwhere,\n\nX: amount of bound ligand for every concentration of compound.\n\nT: total binding, maximum amount bound to the radiolabeled ligand.\n\nN: non-specific binding, amount of radiolabeled ligand bound in a non-specific way irrespective of the receptor used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEvery concentrations of compound were tested in triplicate and their mean values were used to determine the experimental values of % specific binding versus the concentration of compound.

Description\n\n\n\n\n METHODS OF TREATING TUMORS IN IMMUNE-PRIVILEGED SITES\n\n\nFIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a method of treating tumors in immune- privileged sites.\n\n\nCancer is presently the second leading cause of death in developed nations. Despite research that has revealed many of the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis, few new treatments have achieved widespread clinical success in treating solid tumors. The mainstay treatments for most malignancies thus remain gross resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. While increasingly successful, each of these treatments still causes numerous undesired side effects. The primary cause of this is that none of these conventional methods specifically targets only diseased cells. For example, surgery, that can remove the primary tumor but not widespread metastasis, results in pain, traumatic injury to healthy tissue, and scarring. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy cause nausea, immune suppression, gastric ulceration and secondary tumorigenesis, and in the case of brain cancers in most cases chemotherapy does not penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB).\n\n\nIn an effort to develop techniques to more specifically target diseased cells, progress in tumor immunology has led to the discovery of antigens that are preferentially or specifically expressed on cancer cells. These tumor-associated antigens (TAA) or tumor-specific antigens (TSA) have been used as antigenic agents in cancer vaccines designed to stimulate an immune response selectively directed against cancer cells expressing such antigens. See, Tumor Immunology: Immunotherapy and Cancer Vaccines A. G. Dalgleish and M. J. Browning, ods., Cambridge University Press, 1996; Immunotherapy in Cancer, M. Gore and P. Riches, eds., John Wiley & Son Ltd., 1996; Maeurer et al., Melanoma Res., 6: 1 1-24 (1996).\n\n\nTumor cells have also been genetically modified to secrete various cytokines, including interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-8, IL-4, IL-6, gamma-interferon (IFN-γ), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) and have successfully been used in cancer vaccines. \n\n Although tumor vaccines are known to generate potent immune responses against tumors outside the central nervous system (CNS), established tumors within the CNS have failed to respond to such forms of systemic immunotherapy.\n\n\nThe CNS has been shown to accept allografts and xenografts that are otherwise immunologically rejected outside the CNS and thus has been considered an\n\n\n\"immunologically privileged\" site both historically [Murphy, J. B., and E. Sturm. 1926,\n\n\nRockefeller Inst. Med. Res 21:183]) and more recently [Tjuvajev, J., et al., (1995)\n\n\nCancer Res. 55, 1902-1910].\n\n\nAlthough being surveyed by most cells in the immune system, the CNS is surveyed less per organ weight. Lymphocytes are found in low numbers in the CNS of healthy humans or animals, and following activation and entry into the brain, T cells encounter a suppressive cytokine environment, or are driven to apoptosis by F AS-FAS-\n\n\nL interactions.\n\n\nTumors in the brain are either ignored by the immune system or their growth is insufficiently controlled to prevent intracerebral growth. Immunotherapeutic modalities that were shown effective in treatment of cancers such as melanoma outside the CNS have failed to prevent tumor relapses inside the CNS [Mitchell, M. S. 1989. J Clin\n\n\nOncol 7:1701]. Some modes of immunotherapy for brain originating tumors in rats even had negative effects on the clinical outcome [Graf, M. R. et al 2003. J Neuroimmunol 140:49].\n\n\nThe various mechanisms limiting immunoreactivity in the brain are incompletely understood, but likely include distinctive anatomic features such as the absence of conventional draining lymphatics, the presence of the blood-brain barrier, limited antigen presentation by microglia and astrocytes and their unique functionality as antigen presenting cells, Fas/ Fas-L induced apoptosis of lymphocytes and TGF-β mediated cytokine shift.\n\n\nNotwithstanding, the immune privileged status of the CNS is not absolute. In experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) a peripheral immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP) elicits CNS demyelination [Kalman, B., and F. D. Lublin. 1993. Curr Opin Neurol Neurosurg 6:182], suggesting that a systemic effector response can result in a specific immunoreactivity against antigens residing in the CNS. This notion was supported by observations that an effective anti-tumor response in the CNS can be \n\n generated through the use of cytokine-gene modified tumor cell vaccines [Sampson, J. H., et al, 1996. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 93: 10399; Chen, Y., T. et al., 2002, Blood 100: 1373] or the transfer of antigen-specific CD8 Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) [Peng, L., et al 2000. J Immunol 165:5738]. U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,147 teaches an allogenic (histologically incompatible, non- autologous) adoptive transfer of lymphocytes to the patient for the reduction of brain tumors. The lymphocytes are stimulated with tumor cells to provide for their activation. The tumor cells alone are not taught as a method of treating tumors.\n\n\nThe reasons underling rarity of detectable systemic metastases of primary brain tumors is unknown. Approximately 10 cases of spontaneous metastasis of unresected primary GBM were reported in the literature, while the rest of the cases, amounting to less than 0.5 % of the patients occurred following the resection of the primary CNS tumor.\n\n\nAs the most malignant primary central nervous systems tumors, high grade anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme respond poorly to contemporary multimodality treatment programs employing surgical resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy with a median survival of less than one year after initial diagnosis (Pardos, et al., 1997, Cancer Medicine, 1 : 1471-1514; Brandes, et al., 1996, Cancer Invest. 14:551-559; Finlay, J. L., 1992, Pediatric Neuro-Oncology, 278-297; Pardos, et al., 1998, Sem. Surgical Oncol., 14:88-95). Consequently, the development of effective new agents and novel treatment modalities against these very poor prognosis brain tumors remains a major focal point in translational oncology research.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of treating cancer in an immune-privileged site of a subject in need thereof, the method comprising systemically administering to an area outside the immune-privileged site of the subject, a therapeutically effective amount of naive, viable cells of a tumor of the subject, the tumor being in the immune-privileged site so as to generate an immune response in the subject, thereby treating the cancer in the immune-privileged site of the subject. \n\n According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising as an active ingredient naϊve, viable, tumor cells from an immune-privileged site and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\nAccording to yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of treating cancer in an immune-privileged site of a subject in need thereof, the method comprising intravenously administering to an area outside the immune- privileged site of the subject, a therapeutically effective amount of naϊve, inactivated cells of a tumor of the subject, the tumor being in the immune-privileged site so as to generate an immune response in the subject, thereby treating the cancer in the immune- privileged site of the subject.\n\n\nAccording to further features in preferred embodiments of the invention described below, the immune-privileged site is selected from the group consisting of a brain, testes, and the anterior chamber of the eye.\n\n\nAccording to still further features in preferred embodiments of the invention described below, the systemically administering is effected subcutaneously, intradermally or intravenously.\n\n\nAccording to still further features in preferred embodiments of the invention described below, the cells of the tumor are autologous cells.\n\n\nAccording to still further features in preferred embodiments of the invention described below, the cells of the tumor are non-auto logous cells.\n\n\nAccording to still further features in preferred embodiments of the invention described below, the method further comprises administering inactivated cells of the tumor prior to administering the viable cells of the tumor.\n\n\nAccording to still further features in preferred embodiments of the invention described below, the inactivated cells are administered under a regimen which comprises 2 or more administrations.\n\n\nAccording to still further features in preferred embodiments of the invention described below, the naϊve viable cells are administered under a regimen which comprises 2 or more administrations.

With specific reference now to the drawings in detail, it is stressed that the particulars shown are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the preferred embodiments of the present invention only, and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the invention.\n\n\nIn this regard, no attempt is made to show structural details of the invention in more detail than is necessary for a fundamental understanding of the invention, the description taken with the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how the several forms of the invention may be embodied in practice. \n\n In the drawings:\n\n\nFIG. 1 is a line graph illustrating the spontaneous rejection of subcutaneously implanted F98 tumor. Means of tumor diameter are depicted with standard error bars.\n\n\nFIGs. 2A-C are Kaplan-Meier survival curves for rats following intracranial administration of F98 cells having received a subcutaneous pre-immunization with live\n\n\n(Figure 2A) and radiated (Figures 2B and 2C) F98 cells. For Figure 2B rats were immunized with an inoculum of 2x10\n6\n irradiated F98 glioma s.c. three times at 14 day intervals. For Figure 2C, rats were immunized by a single injection of 500O rad irradiated F98 s.c. (2x10\n6\n). The experiment was repeated four times with similar results for live F98 cells and twice for irradiated cells. Survival of treated group was extended in comparison to untreated group (Wilcoxon PO.05).\n\n\nFIG. 3 is a Kaplan-Meier survival curve illustrating an increase in survival for intracerebally, tumor pre-implanted rats following subcutaneous administration of a live F98 tumor. The experiment was repeated twice with similar results. FIGs. 4A-F are photographs of intestines and lungs of either healthy rats or rats who were injected with 2x10\n5\n live F98 tumor either i.p. or i.v. Tumor ridden intestines of two animals dying following an i.p. injection are depicted in Figures 4A.-B -while Figure 4C depicts normal rat intestines. Tumor ridden lungs of two animals dying following an i.v. injection are depicted in Figures 4D-E while Figure 4F depicts normal rat lungs.\n\n\nFIGs. 5A-B are Kaplan-Meier survival curves for F98 tumor-bearing rats. A post-mortem was conducted on all animals to determine tumor presence in brains, lung- cavities and in the abdomen cavity. Animals dying with a lung tumor were classified as: 'F98 i.v. (lung tumor)' (lines marked with O - Figure 5A), animals dying with an intraperitoneal tumor were classified as 'F98 i.p. (tumor i.p)' ' (lines marked with O - Figure 5B) otherwise treated animals (injected with live tumors i.v. or i.p. and rejecting these tumors, were termed either 'F98 i.v.' or 'F98 i.p.' (lines marked with X - Figures 5A and 5B respectively). Survival of i.v. injected group free of lung tumors (F98 i.v.) was extended as compared to the untreated group (PO.05 Log-Rank). One animal from the i.v. treated (N=I) survived over 120 days.\n\n\nFIGs. 6A-B are graphs illustrating the memory and transferability of F98 immunity. Figure 6A is a point graphs illustrating that rats rejecting an i.e. tumor and \n\n surviving ~300d (Rejecting ic) rejected subsequent 5xlO\n5\n F98 tumor cells s.c. challenge in the flank to a greater extent than the control group. Tumor diameters were measured in individual rats. Mean tumor area is depicted with standard error bars. Statistics: (Rejecting ic) group had smaller tumors (PO.005 two-tailed student t-test). Figure 6B is a point graph illustrating the effect of injection of splenocytes either from a naive rat or splenocytes from a rat rejecting an intracranial challenge into subcutaneously challenged rats. Two groups of four Eight-week old female Fischer rats were inoculated in the flank with 2x10\n5\n live F98 Glioma tumor cells. The next day both groups were irradiated 500 rads, and two days after irradiation groups were injected with 10\n7\n splenocytes either from a naive rat or splenocytes from a rat rejecting an intracranial challenge that were co-cultured for four days with irradiated and mitomycin treated F98 tumor cells. Two perpendicular measurements of the tumors were recorded every 2-7 days. An average of these two measurements in individual rats was used to calculate circular tumor area. Means of tumor area are depicted with standard error bars. Significant differences were found in 5/7 time points from day 19 until day 37 (two- tailed student t-test, P<0.05). Three out of four rats in the rejecting-splenocytes treated group and one out of four rats in the naϊve-splenocytes treated group were tumor free by day 72.\n\n\nFIG. 7 is a Kaplan-Meier survival curve for F98 tumor-bearing rats. Groups of 4-5, six-week old female Fischer rats were stereotactically injected with 5xlO\n3\n F98 tumor intracranially. The next day both groups were irradiated 500 rads, and two days after irradiation groups were injected with 10\n7\n unsorted splenocytes from a naϊve rat (line) or with splenocytes from a rat rejecting an intracranial challenge that were co- cultured for four days with irradiated and mitomycin treated F98 tumor cells (a line marked with O), or with the rejecting rat splenocytes that were MACS depleted either of CD4\n+\n cells (a line marked with X) or MACS depleted of the CD8\n+\n cells (a line marked with colored squares). Survival of rats was followed; Survival of group receiving 'rejecting splenocytes' was higher than that of the control group receiving naive splenocytes (P<0.02 Log-Rank). Survival of the group receiving CD4\n+\n depleted rejecting splenocytes was higher than of untreated group (P<0.005 Log-Rank). Survival time of the CD8 depleted group was 18% longer than that of control group but marginally insignificant (P<0.09 Log-Rank). \n\n FIG. 8 is a bar graph illustrating the lytic activity of splenocytes from naive or intracranial tumor-rejecting rats. Splenocytes from a rat rejecting an intracranial challenge were restimulated with irradiated and mitomycin-treated F98 tumor cells. The cells were then purified by MACS sorting for CD4\n+\n (CD4 imm.) or CD8\n+\n cells (CD8 imm.) on MACS separation columns or were left unsorted (Unsorted imm.). These groups and a control naϊve splenocyte group (naive) were assayed in a 16 hr. methionine release cytotoxicity assay. Targets were either the F98 Glioblastoma or the MHC- matched CNS-I astrocytoma. Results depicted with standard error bar. Statistics: lysis of F98 by unsorted imm. and of F98 by CD8 imm. is stronger than respective lysis of CNS-I (two-tailed student t-test PO.05). Lysis of F98 by CD8 imm. is stronger than all other groups apart from F98-unsorted imm. (ANOV A+Tukey Kramer P<0.05).\n\n\nFIG. 9 is a Kaplan-Meier survival curves for F98 tumor-bearing rats: splenocytes obtained from a rat rejecting an intracranial F98 tumor challenge were re- stimulated with F98 irradiated cells and sorted for CD4\n+\n cells by MACS separation columns. Following a 3 -day stimulation, the cells were put in IL-2 containing propagation (rest) medium for four days and were then restimulated with F98 irradiated tumor cells for 3 days and injected (2xlO\n6\n) i.p. to Fischer six-week old female rats. A few hours later, the treated group and a group of naive age matched control rats were injected intracranially with 5x10\n3\n F98 tumor. Survival of rats was followed; Survival of CD4\n+\n treated group was higher than of untreated group (Log-Rank PO.05).\n\n\nFIG. 10 is a bar graph illustrating the proliferation of CD4\n+\n cells from a rat rejecting intracranial F98 tumor and of naϊve splenocytes. CD4+ splenocytes derived by MACS sorting of restimulated splenocytes from a rat rejecting intracranial F98 tumor, or naϊve splenocytes were co-cultured with irradiated APC and irradiated F98 tumor for three days. Cells were then washed and transferred to propagation medium for four days and then used in the proliferation assay. Cells were co-cultured either with the irradiated F98 glioma, or the irradiated MHC-matched CNS-I astrocytoma. After two days wells were pulsed with H labeled thymidine. Plates were read on a gas β-counter. Net cpm was derived by subtracting the mean cpm of the irradiated tumor alone from the mean cpm of the corresponding 'tumor + APC + T cells'. Means of net cpm are depicted with standard-error bars. T-cells, either naϊve or 'CD4 rejecting' without the addition of irradiated APC had low proliferation rates with cpm readings under 600 for \n\n any target (not depicted). The proliferation to different amounts of F98 cells in the 'CD4 rejecting+APC group was higher than proliferation to medium in that group (ANOVA + Tukey-Kramer P<0.05).\n\n\nFIG. 11 is a bar graph illustrating the results of an ELISA assay measuring cytokine secretion of splenocytes from naive or intracranial tumor-rejecting rats: Splenocytes from a rat rejecting an intracranial challenge were re-stimulated for four days on irradiated and mitomycin-treated F98 tumor cells. The cells were then either sorted for CD4\n+\n (CD4 imm.) or for CD8\n+\n cells (CD8 imm.) on MACS separation columns or were left unsorted (Unsorted imm.). The three groups and a control group of naϊve splenocytes (naive) were co-incubated with either an irradiated F98 glioma or with an MHC-matched irradiated astrocytoma (CNS-I). Sixteen hours later supernatants were collected and used in an IFN-γ ELISA assay. Results presented in pg/ml and represent an average of triplicate culture. IFN-γ secretion to F98 in the 'Unsorted imm.' and 'CD4 imm.' Groups was significantly higher than that of naϊve (ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer P<0.05). Secretion of 'CD4 imm.' to F98 was higher than to CNS-I (two-tailed student t-test, PO.05). Assay was repeated twice with similar results.\n\n\nFIGs. 12A-I depict immunohistochemical photographs taken from a rat injected with a s.c. and a brain tumor. The figure depicts a s.c. tumor (Figures 12 A, 12D and 12G), a brain tumor (Figures 12B, 12E and 12H) and the contralateral normal brain (Figures 12C, 12F and 121) stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue) staining for cell nucleus, and with antibodies recognizing total T-cells (W3/13) - Figures 12A-C, CD8 cells (OX- 8) - Figures 12D-F and macrophages (ED-l)-detected by the red Cy3-coupled secondary donkey anti mouse antibodies - Figures 12G-I.\n\n\nFIGs. 13A-B are Kaplan-Meier survival curve for Lewis rats. For Figure 13 A Lewis rats were immunized either s.c. three times in the flank at weekly intervals, or twice i.v. in the tail vein at a bi-weekly interval with 2x10\n6\n 5000 rad irradiated CNS-I astrocytoma. Ten days after last immunization rats were injected i.e. with 10\n3\n CNS-I tumor cells. Both the treated groups had extended survival vs. control (Log Rank P<0.005 or less). For Figure 13B, Lewis rats were inoculated i.e. with CNS-I astrocytoma. Rats were immunized either once i.v. three days post challenge or twice subcutaneously on day 3 and 8 post challenge with 2x10\n6\n 5000 rad irradiated CNS-I cells. Both treated groups had extended survival vs. control (Log Rank PO.005 or less). \n\n FIGs. 14A-B are Kaplan-Meier survival curves illustrating the effect of live cell inoculation vs. irradiated cell inoculation on protection against intracranial challenge of tumor cells. Figure 14A: Rats were injected with 2xlO\n5\n live or 2xlO\n5\n irradiated cells subcutaneously 5 weeks prior to an intracranial (i.e.) challenge. Figure IB: Irradiated cells (2xlO\n6\n) were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) two weeks prior to the i.e. challenge while live cells (2x10\n5\n) were injected s.c. 11 weeks prior to the i.e. challenge. All rats and control untreated groups were challenged i.e. with (5x10\n3\n) F98 cells. Survival of rats is depicted on Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Statistical significance of live cells vs. irradiated cells, or irradiated cells vs. the untreated group is marked on the graph. In both experiments survival of live cell treated group was significantly different to both the untreated group and to the group treated with irradiated cells. In both cases the irradiated cell treated group survival curves was not significantly different to the untreated group.\n\n\nFIGs. 15A-B are Kaplan-Meier survival curves comparing different clinical protocols for immunization using both irradiated and live cells. Groups of 6-8 rats were injected subcutaneously either with 2xlO\n5\n irradiated cells (Figure 15A), or with 2xlO\n6\n irradiated cells twice followed by live cells twice (2xlO\n5\n; Figure 15B) prior to an intracranial challenge with 5x10\n3\n F98 cells. Other inoculations were also tested including an inoculation with live cells (2x10\n5\n) preceded either by a live cell inoculation (2xlO\n5\n) or by an irradiated cell inoculation (2xl0\n5\n-15A, 2xlO\n6\n-15B) - or as a single live-cell treatment (Figures 15 A-B). Survival of rats is depicted using Kaplan Meir survival curves. Indicated statistical significance was calculated using Log rank test vs. the untreated group. All rats surviving beyond the depicted area in both graphs, survived at least 240 days following intracranial tumor challenge. FIG. 16 is a Kaplan-Meier survival curve illustrating that non-rejected F98 tumors removed surgically protect against F98 i.e. tumor challenge. Three rats were injected with 2xlO\n5\n F98 tumor cells subcutaneously. After 41 days, at which time tumors did not exhibit spontaneous rejection in the rats, the tumors were surgically removed. Fifteen days following tumor removal, the three rats and a control untreated group (N=7) were challenged i.e. with 5x10\n3\n F98 cells and followed for survival. Statistical significance is indicated on the Kaplan Mayer survival curve. \n\n FIG. 17 is a bar graph illustrating that non-spontaneously rejected CNS-I tumors in Lewis rats removed surgically protect against a CNS-I i.e. tumor challenge. Groups of 4-5 rats were injected subcutaneously either with irradiated CNS-I cells (2xlO\n6\n) or with live cells (5x10\n4\n) or with combinations of both irradiated and then live cells, as indicated in the graph. All rats and a control untreated group were challenged with CNS-I (10\n3\n) cells intracranially. Survival of rats is depicted in Bar graph with standard error bars. Statistical significance between all groups and the untreated group is P=0.005 or less (Log Rank). All rats surviving beyond the depicted area in the graph, survived at least 270 days following intracranial tumor challenge. FIGs. 18A-B are intra-vital images of rats as analyzed following injection of a an F98 tumor stably transfected with the firefly luciferase gene. The figures comprise black and white image of the rats, overlayed with color enhanced tumor luminescence images. Figure 18 A comprises sequel images of the same representative rats taken after 2 days and 10 days post subcutaneous tumor injection. Figure 18B comprises images taken after 16 days and 23 days post injection.\n\n\nFIG. 19 are intra-vital head images of representative rats, each exhibiting the median survival of their group or its subgroup. Luciferase transfected F98 tumors were traced following intracranial injection: Thirty days following subcutaneous injection and complete rejection of either 2xlO\n5\n or 2xlO\n6\n F98-luc cells, the two injected groups and an untreated group of rats were challenged i.e. with 5x10\n3\n F98-luc cells. Rats were followed weekly using the IVIS optical system for tumor luminescence. Survival of all the rats in each group, recorded at 41 days, appears below each group or subgroup. The very weak luminescence appearing in some cases in the tips of some animals' noses are unspecifϊc IVIS artifacts, likely due to consumption of plant (chlorophyll) containing food. The assay was repeated twice with similar results.\n\n\nFIG. 20 is a Kaplan-Meier survival curve illustrating use of single cells obtained from brain tumors vs. density gradient separated tumor cells. F98 tumors from brains of rats were harvested and broken down to viable single cells using trypsin. A portion of these cells was run on a three-step percoll gradient. The cells collected on the 1.05g/ml to 1.08g/ml interphase, were washed and used as s.c. vaccine. Another group was injected s.c. with the same amount (10\n5\n) of viable percoll-unseparated brain-tumor derived cells. Following s.c. tumor acceptance and rejection, all animals and a control \n\n untreated group were challenged with F98 tumor cells (5x10\n3\n) i.e. Survival data from two experiments are summarized using Kaplan Mayer survival curves.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention is of methods and pharmaceutical compositions for treating tumors in immune-privileged tissues (e.g. brain tumors).\n\n\nBefore explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details set forth in the following description or exemplified by the Examples. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.\n\n\nTumor vaccines are known to generate potent immune responses against tumors originating from non-central nervous system (CNS) tumors. However, established tumors originating within the CNS have failed to respond to such forms of systemic immunotherapy.\n\n\nThe various mechanisms limiting immuno-reactivity in the brain are incompletely understood, but likely include distinctive anatomic features such as the absence of conventional draining lymphatics, the presence of the blood-brain barrier, limited antigen presentation by microglia and astrocytes and their unique functionality as antigen presenting cells, Fas/ Fas-L induced apoptosis of lymphocytes, TGF-β mediated cytokine shift and immune suppression.\n\n\nWhilst conceiving the present invention, the present inventors noticed that only\n\n\n0.5 % of patients with CNS tumors have extracranial metastasis, almost all of which are found in immuno-compromised hosts. Incidental data shows that patients having extracranial metastasis (by inadvertent escape of tumor cells following resection) live approximately 60 % longer than those not having extracranial metastasis.\n\n\nThese facts led the present inventors to query the immune consequences of placement of live CNS tumor cells outside the CNS. The present inventors unexpectedly and surprisingly found that whereas a live tumor challenge in one site\n\n\n(here an immune privileged site) is lethal, it's placement in another site (i.e., outside of the immuno-privileged site), generates systemic immunity. The present inventors \n\n showed that this immunity could spread to the original site in which the tumor is lethal, i.e. the brain, increasing survival of tested animals and in some cases causing complete tumor regression. Presently, common belief holds that inoculation of a live vaccine is too dangerous for clinical applications unless it has been altered in some way so as to enhance its immunogenicity. The present inventors have shown that in the case of tumors originating in immune privileged sites, this is not correct. The strategy described herein, is thus a significant departure from previous approaches to cancer immunotherapy in humans.\n\n\nThus, as is illustrated herein below and in the Examples section which follows, aggressive F98 Fischer rat glioma, placed subcutaneously in rats spontaneously immunologically regresses (Figure 1). This regression dramatically enhances survival of rats either pre-implanted with tumor intracranially (Figure 3) or injected with tumor intracranially following a subcutaneous tumor regression (Figures 2A-C). The median increase in survival was approximately 80 % for both. Furthermore, the present inventors showed that subcutaneous administration of either live or irradiated tumor cells were effective at inducing an immune response in the brain (Figure 2B). In addition, the vaccines of the present invention were shown to be effective in reducing brain tumors following intravenous administration to non privileged sites (Figures 4A-F). Anti-CNS tumor immune responses have been generated through the use of cytokine-gene modified tumor cell vaccines [Sampson, J. H., et al., 1996. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 93:10399; Chen, Y., T. et al., 2002, Blood 100:1373]. Sampson et al use live transfected tumor cells that originate from a non-immune privileged tissue (Melanoma skin cells). The present invention utilizes non-transfected (naϊve) tumor cells from immune-privileged tissues.\n\n\nChen et al also use live transfected brain tumor cells. Chen et al teach that the systemic administration of non-transfected T9C3 tumor cells results in tumor generation at the site of administration. Thus, Chen et al teach away from the method of the present invention. T9 is a gliosarcoma, which indicates that the tumor is of connective tissue origin [Shibuya N, et al., J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 1984 Jul;43(4):426-38. It is plausible therefore that the tumor used by Chen did not originate from a bona fide immune privileged tissue. \n\n Blumbach (WO 96/05866) teaches vaccines of live tumor cells transduced with: a) a gene coding for an immunostimulatory protein; b) a cytokine; and c) a thymidine kinase gene. The composition is provided as live cells which can grow in vivo and stimulate a response, and then be selectively killed via the thymidine kinase. In sharp contrast to the present invention, the effectiveness of such vaccines is due to their genetic modification so as to enhance immunogenicity.\n\n\nThe advantage of the present invention over that taught by Sampson et al, Chen et al and Blumbach (WO 96/05866) is that no prior treatment or activation of the tumor cells is required to induce an immune response. Consequently, the tumor cells are not diminished in their therapeutic efficacy (e.g. change in antigenic expression due to even short term culturing of brain tumor cells) as a result of manipulation over time.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 6,207,147 teaches an allogenic (histologically incompatible, non- autologous) adoptive transfer of lymphocytes to the patient for the reduction of brain tumors. The lymphocytes are stimulated with tumor cells to provide for their activation. The tumor cells alone are not taught as a method of treating tumors.\n\n\nThus, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of treating cancer in an immune-privileged site of a subject in need thereof, the method comprising systemically administering to an area outside the immune- privileged site of the subject, a therapeutically effective amount of naive, viable cells of a tumor of the subject, the tumor being in the immune privileged site so as to generate an immune response in the subject, thereby treating the cancer in the immune- privileged site of the subject.\n\n\nAs used herein the term \"treating\" refers to preventing, alleviating or diminishing a symptom associated with a tumor-bearing disease. Preferably, treating cures, e.g., substantially eliminates the tumor, increases survival time, or at least reduces the tumor size and other symptoms associated with the tumor.\n\n\nAs used herein, the phrase immune-privileged site\" refers to a site in the body which is known to accept non-allogeneic (non-histocompatibile) tissue grafts. Such sites include the brain, the anterior chamber of the eye, and the testes Tumors of the present invention preferably express antigens capable of stimulating the peripheral immune system. \n\n Without being bound to theory, it is believed that the lack of tight immune surveillance in an immune-privileged site allows the unimpeded expression of antigens that are suitable targets for immune cells in the periphery. By exposure of the tumor in peripheral tissues where immune surveillance is more intense, the tumor antigens are immunogenically detected. The activated immune response may then spread to the immune privileged site and thus confer immune protection in the tumor's tissue of origin. It is also plausible that some antigens expressed by brain tumors are not under the regulation of immune tolerance mechanisms, limiting immune responses to most self antigens. Preferably, the cancer originates in the immune privileged site.\n\n\nExamples of brain tumors which may be treated according to this aspect of the present invention include, but are not limited to glioma and glioblastoma, neuroma and neuroblastoma, gangliomas, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngiomas, pineal region tumors or tumor having mixed components. Examples of eye tumors which may be treated according to this aspect of the present invention include, but are not limited to retinoblastomas and intraocular melanomas.\n\n\nExamples of testicular tumors which may be treated according to this aspect of the present invention include, but are not limited to mixed germ cell tumors, hydroceles, seminomas, teratomas and teratocarcinomas.\n\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the present invention, the tumor is a glioblastoma.\n\n\nAs used herein the term \"subject\" refers to any (e.g., mammalian) subject, preferably a human subject. As mentioned hereinabove, the method of the present invention is affected by systemically administering naϊve viable tumor cells which are typically situated in an immune-privileged site to an area outside the immune-privileged site.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"naive\" refers to cells that have not been genetically, physically (e.g. irradiated) or chemically modified. Preferably, the cells are not modified in any other way to bring about a change in their immunogenicity. Thus, for example, the tumor cells of the present invention are not genetically modified to secrete \n\n cytokines or chemically activated to increase immunogenicity such as chemical modification with materials such as haptens or dinitrophenyl (DNP).\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"viable\" refers to tumor cells that are capable of growth. As illustrated in Figures 2A-B, live tumors were more efficacious than irradiated tumors at eliciting an immunogenic response.\n\n\nWithout being bound to theory, it has been postulated that the differences between inoculation with live tumors and immunization with irradiated tumors arise form the difference in the time of exposure of tumor antigens to the immune system, as live tumor cells are present for approximately 3 weeks (as the cells divide from a small tumor which is subsequently rejected completely) while antigen from the irradiated cells might be present for shorter periods of time. The changes might also stem out of the differences in the antigenic profile of the live vs. the irradiated cells, There also might be other qualitative differences between using live and irradiated tumor cells as an immunization protocol. Tumor cells are generally sampled by a surgical procedure, including but not limited to biopsy, or surgical resection or debulking. Solid tumors can be dissociated into separate cells (i.e. single cell suspension) by physical manipulation optionally combined with enzymatic treatment with such enzymes as Hyaluronidase DNAase, Collagenase, Trypsin, Dispase and Neuraminidase and the like. The cells may then be transferred into fresh physiological or growth medium. Cells may be stored until further use, for example, by freezing in liquid nitrogen.\n\n\nPreferably, the original tumor cell preparation is performed without cell propagation (i.e. non-cultured), since it is possible that a critical tumor antigen will be lost through the culturing process. However, the present inventors also envisage expanding the tumor cell population, especially when the original tumor mass is small, to ensure an adequate supply. Cells may be cultured in a growth medium suitable for propagation, optionally supplemented with growth factors. Conditions for reliably establishing short-term cultures and obtaining at least 10\n8\n cells from a variety of tumor types is described by Dillman et al. (1993) J. Immunother. 14:65-69. The cell population may also optionally be cloned to obtain a clinical sample of well-defined parameters. \n\n Tumors obtained from patients comprise many different cell types. For example, tumor cells may be surrounded by normal brain cells, by fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, etc. It may be preferable to purify the tumor cells i.e. enrich for a particular cell type within the tumor cells - e.g. glioma cells. This might serve to enhance the immune response generated by the tumor cells inoculum, and to reduce the possibility of inadvertently causing an autoimmune disease. An exemplary method for enriching is as follows: Initially, tumor cells may be screened to ascertain a set of markers that may discriminate tumor from non-tumor cells. Preferably membranal markers are used on live cells, as staining for intracellular markers would require fixation and permeabilization, processes that kill the cells.\n\n\nExemplary antibodies that may be used in such screening techniques (and also purification techniques) include but are not limited to: antibodies to normal oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and oligo/astrocyte precursor cells [(M)-indicates a membranal antigen] (e.g. Myelin associated glycoprotein-MAG. Proteolipid protein- PLP (M), Sulfatide-04 (M), 010, Vimentin (M), Neuron specific enolase, Epidermal growth factor receptor-EGFR (M), Platelet-derived growth factor -PDGF, PDGF receptor-PDGFR (M), Neuronal cell adhesion molecule (M)); unique oligodendrocytes markers: (e.g. Myelin Basic Protein -MBP, Galactocerebroside-GalC or Ol (M); Unique astrocytes markers: (e.g. Glial fibrillary acidic protein-GFAP, SlOO; Neuronal precursor and progenitor markers: (e.g. Vimentin, Nestin, MAP-2, NFP 160 and various neurotransmitter receptors; Microglial markers:(e.g. CDl Ic (M), CD45 (M), CD68 (M));Endothelial cell surface markers: CD-31 (M)), Unique Astrocytoma grade II-IV markers: (e.g. Aquaporinl-AQl (M), Topoisomerase 2A -TOP2A, Vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMP) and VAMB, Caveolinl, Chitinase 3-like 2-CHI3L2 (M) and CHI3L1, Serum amyloid Al- SAAl (M), NeuromedinB , ATP-binding cassette, subfamily C -ABCC, Secreted modular calcium-binding 1-SMOC-l, SPARC/osteonectin, Matrix GIa protein-MGP (M), Thymidilate synthetase -TYMS, Vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 -VCAMl (M), CD24 (M), Glutathione peroxidase-3- GPX3 (M), Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan-BCAN (M), Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7-IGFBP7 (M), Stabilin 1 -STABl (M), Glycoprotein nmb- GPNMB (M). Expression profiles of stage II-IV astrocytomas are found in Genie website www.cgapdotncidotnihdotgov/SAGE. \n\n Next, a selection step may be performed. This step can be performed using various physical, chemical, and biological methods such as, but not limited to: sorting by FACS, purifying using density gradients and sorting by Magnetic columns (MACS, iMagnet etc.) deletion of irrelevant cells by complement, etc. Thus, according to another embodiment, the tumor cells are purified prior to administration. As described in Example 14, tumor cells purified using a density percoll gradient, showed an enhanced efficacy compared to tumor cells that were not purified\n\n\nThe naϊve tumor cells of the present invention are preferably autologous since subject-specific antigens are usually very unique and usually serve as better targets than those shared by other subjects, although non-autologous tumor cells are also contemplated. Preferably, the non-autologous tumor cells comprise the same type of tumor as that being treated. Thus, for example if a patient has a glioblastoma, preferably the non-autologous tumor cells comprise glioma tumor cells. Preferably, the non-autologous tumor cells posses at least one HLA allele compatible with the patient.\n\n\nAccording to one embodiment of the present invention, inactivated tumor cells may be administered as well as viable tumor cells. Preferably the inactivated tumor cells are administered prior to administration of the viable tumor cells.\n\n\nAs used herein, the phrase \"inactivated tumor cells\" refers to naϊve tumor cell that have been rendered incapable of no more than three rounds of cell division to form progeny. The cells may nonetheless be capable of response to stimulus, or biosynthesis, antigen presentation, and/or secretion of cell products such as cytokines. Methods of inactivation are known in the art. Preferred methods of inactivation are treatment with toxins such as mitomycin C (preferably at least 10 μg/mL; more preferably at least about 50 μg/mL), or irradiation (preferably with at least about 5,000 cGy, more preferably at least about 10,000 cGy, more preferably at least about 20,000 cGy). Cells that have been fixed or permeabilized and are incapable of division are also examples of inactivated cells.\n\n\nThe naϊve tumor cells of the present invention can be administered together with activated lymphocytes (e.g. splenocytes) so as to enhance the immune response thereto. As illustrated in Example 5, immunity against tumors in immune-privileged sites was shown to be transferable by lymphocytes. Preferably, the lymphocytes are autologous. \n\n The activated lymphocytes may be administered in combination with the naϊve tumor cells of the present invention or at a later or earlier time.\n\n\nAs mentioned hereinabove, the cells of the present invention are administered to an area outside of the immuno-priveleged site. Suitable modes and routes of administration are provided hereinbelow.\n\n\nVarious regimens of administration are contemplated by the present invention. For example, an exemplary regimen comprises administering live cells on two separate occasions. The live cell administration may be preempted by at least one administration of irradiated cells. According to one embodiment a period of time of about one week, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks or more is waited between each inoculation. The naϊve tumor cells of the present invention can be administered to an organism per se, or in a pharmaceutical composition where it is mixed with suitable carriers or excipients.\n\n\nAs used herein a \"pharmaceutical composition\" refers to a preparation of one or more of the active ingredients described herein with other chemical components such as physiologically suitable carriers and excipients. The purpose of a pharmaceutical composition is to facilitate administration of a compound to an organism.\n\n\nHerein the term \"active ingredient\" refers to the tumor cells accountable for the biological effect.\n\n\nHereinafter, the phrases \"physiologically acceptable carrier\" and \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" which may be interchangeably used refer to a carrier or a diluent that does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the administered compound. The carrier may also include biological or chemical substances that modulate the immune response.\n\n\nHerein the term \"excipient\" refers to an inert substance added to a pharmaceutical composition to further facilitate administration of an active ingredient.\n\n\nExamples, without limitation, of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\nTechniques for formulation and administration of drugs may be found in \"Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,\" Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, latest edition, which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n Suitable routes of administration into the area outside the immuno-priveleged site include systemic delivery, including intramuscular, intradermic, subcutaneous, intravenous and intraperitoneal injections. Preferably, the tumor cells of the present invention are administered subcutaneously or intravenously. Both the pharmaceutical composition and the mode of delivery should be compatible with maintaining cell viability. Thus, the gauge of the syringe should be selected not to cause shearing and the pharmaceutical composition should not comprise any component toxic to cells etc.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention thus may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries, which facilitate processing of the active ingredients into preparations which, can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen.\n\n\nFor injection, the active ingredients of the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological salt buffer or inert growth medium.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical composition described herein may be formulated for parenteral administration, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in context of the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an amount effective to achieve the intended purpose. More specifically, a therapeutically effective amount means an amount of active ingredients (tumor cells) effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of a disorder (e.g., cancer) or prolong the survival of the subject being treated.\n\n\nDetermination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.\n\n\nFor any preparation used in the methods of the invention, the therapeutically effective amount or dose can be estimated initially from animal studies. For example, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a desired concentration or titer. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. \n\n Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the active ingredients described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in vitro, in cell cultures or experimental animals. The data obtained from these in vitro and cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage may vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. (See e.g., Fingl, et al., 1975, in \"The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics\", Ch. 1 p.l).\n\n\nDosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide sufficient immune activation to induce or suppress the biological effect (minimal effective concentration, MEC). The MEC will vary for each preparation, but can be estimated from in vitro data. Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. Detection assays can be used to determine plasma concentrations. Depending on the severity and responsiveness of the condition to be treated, dosing can be of a single or a plurality of administrations, with course of treatment lasting from several days to several weeks months or years or until cure is effected or diminution of the disease state is achieved.\n\n\nAdditional objects, advantages, and novel features of the present invention will become apparent to one ordinarily skilled in the art upon examination of the following examples, which are not intended to be limiting.

The tumor is a chemically induced tumor and was shown to be refractory to a variety of therapeutic modalities. Its invasive pattern of growth and uniform lethality following an inoculum of as few as 10 tumor cells make it a particularly attractive model to test new therapeutic modalities. The following experiment was performed in order to demonstrate the spontaneous rejection of subcutaneously implanted F98 tumor.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nAnimals: Fischer F344 rats were obtained from Harlan Israel. Animals were grown in an SPF environment.\n\n\nCells and culture F98 undifferentiated glioma is a chemically induced glioma syngeneic to the Fischer rat. Cells were obtained from the American Type Culture \n\n Collection (ATCC) and maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 4 mM L- glutamine, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, combined antibiotics, 4.5 g/L glucose and 10 % FCS.\n\n\nExperimental procedure: Twenty-one six-week old female Fischer rats were inoculated in the flank with 2x10\n5\n live F98 glioma tumor cells. Two perpendicular measurements of the tumor were recorded every 2-4 days. An average of these two measurements in individual rats was considered the tumor diameter. The experiment was repeated four times with similar results.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, subcutaneous administration of F98 tumor, results in initial growth of the tumor (0.5-1 cm), followed by shrinkage and spontaneous rejection in all challenged rats. The tumor was well established by two weeks, during which time it was able to draw a substantial amount of blood supply to its parenchyma.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2 Assessing protection of subcutaneously administered F98 glioma tumor cells on subsequent Lc. challenge\n\n\nThe following experiment was performed to determine whether spontaneous rejection of subcutaneously administered live F98 glioma tumor cells could enhance survival of rats subsequently challenged intracranially with F98 glioma tumor cells.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nInoculation/immunization s.c: Rats (6 weeks and older) were shaved at the flank and injected subcutaneously with 50 μl of live (2xlO\n5\n F98 cells) or 2xlO\n6\n irradiated tumor cells (5000 rad). For irradiated tumor cells, rats were vaccinated s.c. three times at 14 day intervals with 2x10\n6\n 5000-rad irradiated F98 cells or were immunized by a single injection of 5000 rad irradiated F98 s.c. (2x10\n6\n). Tumor size in individual rats was followed by measurement of two perpendicular measurements of the tumors. Rats with tumors above 3.5 cm in mean diameter were euthanized.\n\n\nInoculation of tumors intracranially: Intracranial administration of live F 98 cells was initiated 7-10 days after the subcutaneously administered tumor cells were \n\n rejected, (other experiments showed similar significant results even 40-50 days after subcutaneous tumor rejection). Intracranial administration of irradiated F98 cells was initiated six weeks after the last immunization. Rats were anesthetized with 80-125 μl (depending on strain and age) of 1:2 of Xylazine 2 % (Vitamed) and Ketamine 100mg/ml (Fort Dodge). Anesthetized animal heads were fixed in a stereotactic apparatus, their head fur shaved and skin opened. A hole was drilled with a microdrill at a point 2 mm anterior to the bregma and 4 mm lateral (right) to the midline. 5x10\n3\n F98 tumor cells were suspended in 2 μl of PBS and were slowly infused to a point 4 mm deep of the skull with a fine Hamilton syringe. Following the injection, the open skull was cleared with 70 % alcohol swab and head-skin was closed with 9 mm Autoclips (Clay Adams) stainless steel wound clips. Procedures were all performed in a sterile environment. Survival of animals was monitored every 1-2 days, moribund animals were euthanized according to regulations.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 2A, pre-treatment of the rats with live tumor increased median survival from 23 days to 41 days (178 %) and the mean calculated by day 120 was approximately 3 times in the treated group than in the control group. Two out of seven rats (29 % in this experiment) in the s.c. treated group survived over 5 times the mean of untreated group, and were considered tumor-free. The overall tumor free fraction in all the protection experiments conducted was approximately 25 % of rats in treated and none in the control groups.\n\n\nFigure 2B illustrates that irradiated tumor cells injected s.c. dramatically extend the survival of rats prophylactically injected with irradiated cells. By day 120 4/6 (67 %) treated rats survived tumor free, while the rats in the control group all died during day 24-31.\n\n\nWhen immunizing with a single dose of 2x10\n6\n irradiated F98 (Figure 2C) mean survival was significantly increased (124 %). In comparison to the results achieved following inoculation with live tumor (167 %) inoculation with irradiated tumors in this instance, were less effective. It is plausible that the differences between inoculation with live tumors and immunization with irradiated tumors arise form the difference in the time of exposure of tumor antigens to the immune system, as live tumor cells are \n\n present for approximately 3 weeks while antigen from the irradiated cells might be present for shorter periods of time. There also might be a qualitative difference between using live and irradiated tumor cells as an immunization protocol.\n\n\nIn a clinical perspective, the use of irradiated cells allows a safer modality of immunization with an excised brain tumor in humans. Repetitive immunizations as used here might represent an effective method by which to employ these immunizations. It is plausible that the combination of an immunization with irradiated tumor followed by the inoculation with live tumor might provide an efficient way to combine the safety and initial-immunity achieved by irradiated tumors and the effectiveness of treating with live tumors.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3 Assessing immunotherapy of established F98 Lc. by live F98 injection s.c.\n\n\nThe following experiment was performed to assess whether subcutaneous injection of F98 could improve survival of rats with established F98 brain tumors.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nSix- week old female Fischer rats were stereotactically injected with 5x10\n3\n F98 tumor intracranially as described hereinabove. Three days following injection rats either received an inoculum of 2x10\n5\n F98 glioma s.c. in the flank (cross) or were left untreated (line).\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 3, injection of a live F98 tumor s.c. increased survival of rats pre-implanted with the tumor intracerebrally. Survival increased by 167 %, although complete loss of tumor was more infrequent in the immunotherapy models than in the protection models.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4 Challenging with F98 in locations other than s.c.\n\n\nThe following experiment was performed in order to ascertain whether immunity to tumors originating from an immune privileged site can be achieved by \n\n translocation of these live tumors to a non privileged site other than the subcutaneous area.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS Animals were injected either s.c, i.v. or i.p. with 2x10\n5\n live F98 tumor, and 45 days following primary injection, all surviving rats were rechallenged with F98 intracranially (apart from one rat out of six in the i.p. injected group which died before challenge). A post-mortem was conducted on all animals to determine tumor presence in brains, lung-cavities and in the abdomen cavity.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nBoth i.v. and i.p. immunizations with live F98 proved more hazardous than s.c, as roughly half of the animals in both groups died from either an abdominal tumor following an i.p. injection (Figure 4A and 4B) or with lung tumors following an i.v. injection (Figure 4D). Figures 4C and 4F depict, respectively, normal abdomens and lungs.\n\n\nThe two modes of immunization had two different outcomes for the surviving portions of rats following the rechallenge with intracranial F98. Four out of seven rats injected i.v. that had no lung metastasis, had a significant prolonged survival compared to the naϊve injected group. The i.v. injected group tripled its mean survival in comparison to that of the naϊve injected group, with 1/4 rats surviving over 120 days (Figure 5A). In contrast, the i.p. immunization had no significant effect on animal survival (Figure 5B), with one animal dying before the F98 rechallenge.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\nTransferability ofF98 immunity by immunized rat splenocytes\n\n\nSince there was an extended time period between initial subcutaneous injections to secondary intracranial challenge, it is plausible to assume that this immune response is a memory-type response, and thus could be attributed to the adaptive immune arm. Accordingly, the following experiments were performed to ascertain whether the immunity may be transferable by splenocytes to naϊve rats. Moreover the mechanisms by which different immune cell subsets operate to eradicate tumors was assayed. \n\n MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nCells and cell culture: F98 cells were cultured as described above. The CNS-I astrocytoma is a chemically induced glioma syngeneic to the Lewis rat. The CNS-I line was provided by William F. Hickey, Dartmouth Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA. The line was grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 4 raM L- glutamine, combined antibiotics, and 10 % FCS.\n\n\nSeparation of lymphocytes on MACS magnetic beads: MACS technique (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH-Bergish Gladbach, Germany), was used to separate CD4\n+\n or CD8\n+\n cell populations for various assays. The effluent of the CD4 or CD8 columns, depleted of either CD4\n+\n or CD8\n+\n cells respectively, and also the CD4+ or CD8+ positive populations removed from the magnetic columns were checked by flow cytometry for purity. Purity of separations from unwarranted cells (i.e. CD4+ cells in the CD8+ preparation) was typically above 99 %. The procedure was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. In vitro cytotoxicity assays: Spleens of rats were removed and teased to a single cell suspension. Red blood cells (RBC) were removed by RBC removal buffer (Sigma) according to manufacturer's protocol. Splenocytes were restimulated in lymphocyte medium (RPMI, 10 % Fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM glutamine, combined antibiotics, ImM sodium pyruvate, 5X10 M β-mercapto ethanol, 1 % nonessential amino acids) with tumor cells that had been irradiated (5000 rad) and Mitomycin-C (80 μg/ml/lO^ cells) treated.\n\n\nFollowing three days of incubation in flasks at 37 °C, splenocytes were washed and mixed with \n35\nS-methionine (10 μCi) labeled target cells. CTL assays were performed in 96 u shaped microtiter wells, at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5 and 16 hr. Cultures were terminated by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 8' at 4°C and 50 μl of the supernatants were transferred to TopSeal™-A, 96 well microplate (Packard), added with microscint™ 40 (Packard) scintillation fluid and counted in a TopCount microplate scintillation & luminescence counter β-counter.\n\n\nPercentage of specific cell lysis was calculated as follows: [(cpm of specific wells) - (spontaneous cpm of same target)] / [(cpm maximal release of target) -\n\n\n(spontaneous cpm of same target)]xlOO. Spontaneous release was determined by \n\n incubation of labeled target cells in lymphocyte medium. Maximal/total release was determined by incubation of target cells in 0.1 M NaOH at the last 20' of the assay.\n\n\nProliferation assays: Various antigens or irradiated tumor cells (5000 rad) treated with mitomycin (80 μg/ml/10^cells) were dispensed in stimulation medium (DMEM, 1 % normal rat serum (NRS), 2 mM glutamine, combined antibiotics, ImM sodium pyruvate, 5X10 M β-mercaptoethanol, 1 % nonessential amino acids) in quadruplicates to 96 well plates. T-cells were added (2.5xlO\n4\n), either with or without 5000 rad irradiated thymocytes (2.5x10\n5\n), serving as APC. After two days cells were pulsed ON with 25 μl of pulsing medium containing PBS and methyl \n3\nH thymidine (5 Ci/mmol-Amersham) at the ratio of 25:1 respectively. Cultures were transferred to 96 well glass-filter (Packard), added with microscint™ 20 (Packard) scintillation fluid and counted in a TopCount microplate scintillation & luminescence counter β-counter. Results are expressed as mean counts per minute (cpm)\n\n\nProliferation assays were also conducted on MACS positively selected, pure (>99%) populations of CD4 or CD8 cells as effectors.\n\n\nELISA assays with irradiated tumors: Following a similar procedure to the proliferation assay, two days following co-culture with irradiated tumors or with antigen, 80 μl of assay supernatant from triplicate or quadruplicate cultures was obtained for an ELISA assay. IFNγ, secretion was determined using standard manufacturer protocols (BD-OptEIA).\n\n\nAdoptive transfer of immunocytes: Spleens were harvested from animals rejecting an intracranial tumor challenge. Red blood cells were lysed and splenocytes were re-stimulated with irradiated, mitomycin C-treated tumor cells at 1 :50 tumor: splenocyte ratio for three days in lymphocyte medium. Naϊve rats were challenged either subcutaneously or intracranially with F98 tumors at indicated doses, the next day rats were irradiated 500 rads total body irradiation (TBI) for non-lethal lymphoablation, and two days following irradiation, groups were injected i.v. with 10\n7\n of the above-mentioned splenocytes either unsorted, or depleted of either CD4 or CD8 cells, or injected with unsorted naϊve rat splenocytes. In the CD4 adoptive transfer experiment, CD4 cells were re-stimulated twice with irradiated and mitomycin treated tumor and subsequently injected without the use of irradiation on the same day of intracranial tumor inoculation. \n\n RESULTS\n\n\nAdoptive transfer of immunocytes: To check for maintenance of an immune memory, rats that had survived an i.e. challenge (~300d) with F98 were subcutaneously rechallenged. These rats were protected from the F98 following its inoculation s.c. Figure 6A shows that the rats of the control group had all accepted the tumors and spontaneously rejected them as observed in Figure 1. In contrast the pretreated rats rejected the tumors much faster and half of the rats had no tumor take.\n\n\nTo determine whether immunity to tumors is transferable by cells, rats were subcutaneously injected with F98 tumor, the following day all rats were irradiated 500 rads Total Body Irradiation (TBI) for non-lethal lymphoablation, after two days groups were replenished either with naive splenocytes or with splenocytes from a rat rejecting an intracranial tumor that were restimulated for four days with irradiated and mitomycin treated F98 tumor.\n\n\nAs seen in Figure 6B, the group receiving the rejecting splenocytes had a significantly smaller mean tumor area as compared to the group replenished with naϊve splenocytes. The rejecting splenocytes restored the ability to reject a subcutaneous tumor in three out of four rats. In the naϊve replenished group only one out of four rats rejected his subcutaneous tumor, while the other animals were culled as the tumor reached an average diameter of 35 mm. The significant difference between the groups was observed only after day- 19.\n\n\nTotal body irradiation, used in the transfer experiment, caused animals to lose their natural ability to spontaneously reject the tumor. Even the replenishment of the irradiated hosts with 10\n7\n splenocytes did not restore their ability to reject the subcutaneous tumor. In this and other experiments it was noted that manipulation of the immune system of the rats, even an injection of a T-cell line that does not recognize a tumor antigen, frequently compromised the animals ability to spontaneously reject the tumor s.c. (data not shown). These results are compatible with the results of Graf et al who showed that several immune manipulations of the 9L gliosarcoma result in increased tumor volumes, and decreased survival of rats [Graf et al, 2003, J Neuroimmunol 140:49]. \n\n IL-2 was not used in the in vivo experiment in this or in any other transfer experiments suggesting that the injected effector cells are not dependent on exogenous IL-2 for their function.\n\n\nTransferability of immunity by T-cell sub-populations: All rats were injected intracranially with live F98 cells, a day later rats were irradiated TBI 500 rads, and after two days were replenished either with 10\n7\n naive splenocytes, with unsorted rejecting cells (splenocytes taken from a rat rejecting an intracranial tumor and restimulated with irradiated mitomycin treated F98), with CD8 depleted rejecting cells (enriched for CD4 cells), or with CD4 depleted rejecting cells (enriched for CD8 cells). As illustrated in Figure 7, immunity was transferable either by the unsorted rejecting splenocytes or by the CD4 depleted group, containing an enriched population of CD8\n+\n cells, both these groups had significantly extended survival in comparison to naϊve-replenished group (131% and 164% survival vs. control respectively). These results suggest that in this case CD8\n+\n cells are pivotal to tumor immunity. The CD4\n+\n population (CD8 depleted) consistently only showed a mild effect on the survival of rats (Log-rank P<0.09, 1 18 % survival vs. control).\n\n\nTaken together the results suggest that a passive transfer of immune restimulated cells or the CD8 containing fraction of these cells significantly delays animal death in the i.e. model. Cytotoxicity of T-cell sub-populations: In order to determine direct killing ability, the different fractions of the rejecting cells were assayed for cytotoxicity in a 4- hour Cytotoxicity assay. Figure 8 shows that both the unsorted rejecting fraction and the MACS positively sorted CD8 fraction (90 % pure CD8 cells devoid of CD4 cells) had a strong differential killing as seen by their lytic profile. The killing of F98 was roughly 2-2.5 times higher towards F98 than to the MHC-matched CNS-I astrocytoma. Both the naive and the CD4\n+\n positively sorted fraction had the same killing to F98 than to CNS-I and a lower cytotoxicity to F98 than found in the two CD8\n+\n containing groups. These results suggest that the CD8\n+\n fraction of the cellular arm is capable of generating a cytotoxic response towards the F98 tumor. Survival following transfer of CD4 cells from F98 rejecting-rat: The CD4\n+\n sorted fraction of F98-restimulated rejecting rat splenocytes were re-stimulated with irradiated and mitomycin treated F98 tumor and injected (2x10\n6\n) into rats at the same \n\n day of F98 i.e. challenge. As illustrated in Figure 9, the restimulated CD4\n+\n cells prolonged rat survival significantly (137 % survival for CD4\n+\n treated vs. control).\n\n\nThese results suggest that under some conditions also the CD4\n+\n cell fraction has an effect on the survival following an F98 i.e. challenge, albeit, this effect is less dramatic than the effect of the CD8\n+\n CD4\n\"\n fraction seen in Figure 7.\n\n\nProliferation of CD4 cells obtained from F98 rejecting-rat The CD4 cells used in Figure 7 were used in a proliferation assay checking their proliferation towards irradiated F98 or CNS-I cells. Figure 10 shows a significant dose-dependent response of the CD4\n+\n rejecting cells but not of the naϊve cells to F98 but not to CNS-I. No response was recorded in either group when irradiated thymocytes (APC) were not added to the wells. These results suggest that CD4\n+\n cells can recognize tumor antigens but need indirect presentation for this recognition.\n\n\nIFN-γ secretion to F98 of T-cell sub-populations: As IFN-γ was shown to have a pivotal role in tumor rejection [Qin, Z., and T. Blankenstein. 2000. Immunity 12:677; Qin, Z., et al, 2003. Cancer Res 63:4095], IFN-γ secretion was measured in response to the tumor by ELISA of co-culture supernatants. Unsorted, four-day F98 -restimulated splenocytes from a rejecting rat, and their CD4\n+\n or CD8\n+\n sorted fraction were incubated for 16 hours with the F98 glioma or the CNS-I astrocytoma in the presence of irradiated APC, naive splenocytes were used as control. Figure 1 1 shows that only the unsorted- rejecting and the CD4\n+\n rejecting fractions, but not the CD8\n+\n rejecting fraction had significant IFN-γ secretion to F98 when compared to the naϊve splenocyte response. The CD4\n+\n cell fraction had a significantly stronger response to F98 than to CNS-I. The same pattern of results was observed in an intracellular IFN-γ secretion assay, (data not shown). Interestingly in both unsorted-rejecting, and CD4\n+\n rejecting groups, the IFN-γ secretion to the MHC matched CNS-I astrocytoma was significantly higher than in the naϊve. This might suggest that the F98 undifferentiated glioma shares expressed antigen/s with the CNS-I astrocytoma. \n\n EXAMPLE 6 Immune cells penetrate s.c. tumor and brain tumor but not surrounding tissue\n\n\nTo check for presence of immune cells in the tumor parenchyma, rats were injected either with a s.c. tumor or with a s.c. tumor and an i.e. tumor or with an i.e. tumor only. One week following tumor/s injection, rats were perfused and brains and s.c. tumors were excised.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nImmunohistochemistry was conducted on animals perfused with freshly prepared paraformaldehyde (PFA) 4 %. Perfused animal tissues (brains and s.c. tumors) were postfixed with 4 % PFA for at least 24 hours. Then 30 % sucrose was added 1 : 1\n\n\nV: V for cryoprotection. The organs were frozen and cut into 14 μm sections in a floating section microtome, slices were kept in PBS-0.1% Azid. For antigen staining, sections were blocked ON with 20% normal donkey serum and 1% normal rat serum. Section were then washed and stained with different mouse monoclonal antibodies overnight at 4°C. The antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Antibodies used were: ED-I (CD68-Serotec) (1 :500) for rat macrophages, W3/13 (1 :500) for total rat T cells, OX-8 (1 :250) for rat CD8 cells. The sections were washed twice for 10 min with PBS\n7\"\n and incubated with CY3-labeled donkey anti-mouse antiserum (1 :5000) (Jackson Immuno-research) ON.\n\n\nCounterstaining of cell nuclei was done with Hoechst 33342. Stained slices were transferred to Superfrost-Plus slides (Menzel Glaser, Germany) and mounted with\n\n\nAquaPolyMount (polysciences, USA).\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nInjection of a tumor s.c. with or without i.c injection was followed by massive infiltration of T-cells, CD8 T-cells, and macrophages reaching all parts of tumor parenchyma.\n\n\nInjection of brain tumor was followed by infiltration of T-cells and CD8 cells, and a small number of macrophages. The infiltration was exclusive to the densely nucleated tumor mass and to the close vicinity of the tumor, but not to other parts of the same hemisphere (not shown) or in the same position in the contralateral hemisphere. \n\n The penetration of T-cells and CD8 cells into the brain tumor was more pronounced in the s.c. treated rat than in the rat injected only with brain tumor (not shown).\n\n\nFigures 12A-I show that an injection of live tumor s.c. does not cause a widespread inflammation in the brain. T-cells in the brain were not observed when there was no tumor residing in the brain. Whenever tumor was injected i.e. the immune reaction was limited to the tumor and to its closest vicinity.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 7 Corroboration of Results in Lewis rat To check the assumptions that peripheral immunization with tumors either via the i.v. or the s.c. modes could protect from an i.e. tumor challenge another tumor model was used, the Lewis-rat CNS-I astrocytoma. As with the F98, also this tumor is syngeneic in (or autologous to) the Lewis host, it is chemically induced and does not carry any known foreign or viral antigens. The biological characteristics of this tumor resemble those of human astrocytomas displaying a single cell infiltration of parenchyma and the ability to spread into leptomeningeal, perivascular and periventricular areas. The tumor is considered an applicable and useful model in neuro- oncology (Barth, R. F. 1998. J Neurooncol 36:91).\n\n\nFollowing an extensive unrelated study with the CNS-I it was noticed that low but constant percentages (5-15 %) of rats injected with CNS-I spontaneously reject the tumors s.c. Moreover injection of a low dose of the live tumor s.c. in the limb was not accepted by the rats and a consequent injection of live CNS-I s.c. in the flank was accepted and then rejected. These preliminary results suggested that also the CNS-I tumor might exhibit the phenomenon of split immunity under certain conditions.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nAnimals: Lewis rats were obtained from Harlan Israel. Animals were grown in an SPF environment.\n\n\nCell culture: CNS-I cells were cultured as described above. \n\n RESULTS\n\n\nLewis rats were injected with irradiated cells either s.c. or i.v. Results of either the protection experiments or the immunotherapy experiments were similar with very strong protection achieved in both modes of immunization. While i.v. injection of irradiated CNS-I three days following tumor inoculation increased mean survival by +86 % (a single i.v. injection) - Figure 13A, a prophylactic vaccination increased survival to over twice mean survival time with 43 % of the animals surviving over 100 days (Figure 13B).\n\n\nMultiple vaccinations s.c. with irradiated CNS-I tumors protected 80-100 % rats from tumor challenge i.e. (rats survived over 150 days) both in the protection (Figure 13A) and in the immunotherapy assays (Figure 13B) with all rats surviving over 100 days.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 8 Effectiveness of live cell vs irradiated cell\n\n\nThe following experiment was performed to test the effectiveness of live cell vs irradiated cell vaccine.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS The experiment was performed essentially as described for Example 2. In the first experiment, Fischer F344 rats were immunized with either 2x10\n5\n live cells, 2x10\n5\n irradiated cells, or were left untreated. In the second experiment, the amount of irradiated cells used was 10 times that of the live cells, i.e. - 2x10\n6\n cells irradiated cells vs 2x10\n5\n live cells.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nFigure 14A demonstrates that while live cells significantly enhanced the survival of the rats, or even cured some of their brain tumors, irradiated cells did not change the survival of the rats vs. the control untreated group. Even when the amount of irradiated cells was increased to ten times the amount of live cells, a significant difference between live and irradiated cells could be observed (Figure 14B). Live cells significantly enhanced the survival of the rats, or even cured some rats of their brain \n\n tumors, while the irradiated cells did not significantly change the survival of the rats vs. the control untreated group. In both assays the survival of the live-cell treated rats was enhanced as compared to the irradiated-cell treated rats.\n\n\nIn conclusion, in both assays the live cell treatment was significantly better than the irradiated cell treatment, both when equal doses of cells were used, and when doses of irradiated cells were 10 times higher than the dose of live cells used for immunization.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 9 Immunization protocol\n\n\nThe following experiment was performed so as to obtain an optimal immunization protocol, both in terms of effectiveness and safety.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS Groups of 7-8 Fischer F344 rats were immunized with combinations of 2xlO\n5\n live cells and 2x10\n6\n irradiated cells. When two or more immunizations of live cells took place, the second injection of live cells was carried out after all tumors from the first injection were spontaneously rejected. For example, in this experiment, the intervals between the injections in the Irr->Irr->Live->Live protocol were 3, 2 and 7.5 weeks respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nFigures 15A-B show in two separate experiments that groups of rats that were inoculated twice with live cells exhibited enhanced survival and higher percentages of long term surviving/cured rats in comparison to the groups inoculated once with live cells.\n\n\nTo enhance the safety of the immunizations, rats were injected s.c. with irradiated cells either once (Figure 15A) or twice (Figure 15B) prior to the injection s.c. with live cells. When rats were injected s.c. with irradiated cells once and then with live cells s.c. (Figure 15A), the injected live cells grew in all animals, albeit, tumor diameters were smaller in average when compared at maximal tumor size (P<0.03, t-test - not \n\n shown). Complete tumor rejection in irradiated-cell treated rats occurred earlier than when injected into naϊve rats (not shown).\n\n\nIn two experiments rats were injected twice with irradiated cells before a live\n\n\nF98 s.c. challenge. In one of the experiments none of the rats (0/8) developed tumors s.c. vs. 13/14 rats that developed s.c. tumors in the naϊve injected groups (PO.00005,\n\n\nFisher exact-not shown). In another experiment, five of six rats that were immunized twice with irradiated cells developed very small (2.5-3.5 mm) tumors for a period of 1-3 days, as compared to approximately 2-3 weeks of tumor growth until rejection in most naϊve injected animals These results indicate that one, but more effectively, two injections of irradiated cells prior to the injection of live cells s.c. either protects the rats completely from the s.c. growth of live tumors, or generates a very quick rejection of these tumors once they appear.\n\n\nThe above results suggest that repeated live inoculations leads to enhanced efficacy, while the repeated immunizations with irradiated cells before the live tumor inoculation leads in most cases to the abrogation of live tumor growth s.c. The results also suggest that a highly protective vaccine could combine the safety of use of irradiated cells, and the efficacy of live cell inoculation.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 10\n\n\nClinical responses to an intracranial, challenge in animals that have not spontaneously rejected their s.c. tumors\n\n\nOne of the theoretical basis on which the invention stands upon is that in most cases live tumor cells that originate from brain tissue are spontaneously rejected in the periphery. In the F98 tumor model, approximately 97 % of the rats (N>200) that received a live tumor challenge s.c. rejected their tumor spontaneously. In one experiment, due to unknown reasons three rats in one group did not reject their s.c. tumors.\n\n\nA different tumor model - the CNS-I astrocytoma (glioma) syngeneic to the Lewis rat, is accepted subcutaneously without rejection in approximately 90-95 % of cases. In 5-10 % of cases, the tumors are accepted s.c. and then spontaneously rejected. \n\n The following experiments were performed in order to ascertain whether the removal of growing s.c. F98 tumors or CNS-I tumors protects rats from a subsequent challenge with intracranial administration of the identical tumor.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nF98 tumors: Tumors of three Fischer F344 rats were surgically removed 41 days following inoculation. No residual metastasis was observed in any of the rats following s.c tumor removal. Fifteen days after the s.c. tumor removal, the rats together with a control untreated group, were challenged i.e. and followed for survival. CNS-I tumors: Lewis rats were injected with live CNS-I cells (5xlO\n4\n cells).\n\n\nTumors grew in all rats and were removed 36 days following injection (mean tumor diameter at removal: 13.5±1.5 mm). No residual metastasis was found subcutaneously in any of the rats following tumor removal. Two other groups were injected s.c. either with 70 Gy irradiated CNS-I cells (2x10\n6\n) once or injected with irradiated cells twice before the injection of live cells s.c. Another group was immunized twice with irradiated cells only. All rats and a control untreated group were challenged with 10 CNS-I cells intracranially and followed for survival.\n\n\nRESULTS F98 tumors: The results are depicted in Figure 16. These results suggest that even in rats that had their tumors removed following uncontrolled s.c. growth (a rare event in this model), the rats survived longer than untreated rats, with 1/3 rats cured of its brain tumor (survival over 330d).\n\n\nCNS-I tumors: Figure 17 shows mean rat survival with standard error bars. As can be seen, the injection of live CNS-I tumor cells to rats and the tumor's subsequent removal completely protects the rats from an i.e. challenge with the tumor. Similarly all the other treated groups, either immunized with irradiated cells or with a combination of irradiated cells and live cells were completely protected from a subsequent intracranial CNS-I tumor challenge. All the rats injected with live cells had growing tumors that were not spontaneously rejected. The group that was immunized with irradiated cells once followed by a live tumor cell injection s.c. supported tumor growth in 3/5 animals. The \n\n small tumors were visible only 1-3 days and were then spontaneously rejected. The group that was immunized twice with irradiated cells and then injected with live cells s.c did not support any s.c. tumor growth. These results corroborate those observed in the F98 model suggesting that the addition of irradiated cells prior to the live cell injection s.c. might abrogate in most cases the growth of the live tumor cells injected subcutaneously. The use of irradiated cells did not compromise the efficacy achieved by the subsequent use of live cells, but rather protected the rats from a s.c. live tumor growth.\n\n\nTaken together the results suggest that even in the worst case scenario in which live brain tumor cells are injected in an extracranial site and are not spontaneously rejected, following the tumors surgical removal, immunity to an intracranial tumor challenge can still be achieved. The removal of the s.c. tumor generates sufficient immunity that even if some residual tumor cells remained s.c. they will probably also be rejected. The results also indicate that the combination of irradiated and live tumor cell vaccine may provide both the safety provided by the irradiated cells (lack of tumor growth s.c), and the efficacy conferred by live cells.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 11 Follow-up on the complete elimination of the live tumor cells injected s.c. The following experiment was performed to ascertain whether all tumor cells injected s.c. do not metastasize to distant organs and are fully rejected s.c. following their observed visual disappearance.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS A concern that might be raised using live tumor cells as an immunizing agent is that some cells might remain s.c. even following complete rejection as observed by the eye. To answer this question, the firefly luciferase gene was stably transfected into the F98 tumor. A clone of the F98-luciferase tumor was then followed intra-vitally inside the rat by the tumor's luminescence. Rats were injected with 250 μl of Luciferin , the substrate that is oxidized by the Luciferase expressed by the tumors. This reaction produces visible light. Using this method, even a small number of tumor cells that cannot be felt by fingers or measured visually by clippers can be detected inside the rat, \n\n even beyond bone material (such as skull). Intra-vital imaging was performed once a week using the IVIS optical imaging system (see: wwwdotcaliperlsdotcom/products/optical-imaging/).\n\n\nTo follow s.c. and distant organ metastasis following tumor challenge rats were injected either 2xlO\n5\n live cells in lOOμl volume s.c. (the usual volume and cell quantity used) or injected with 2xlO\n6\n live cells in lOOOμl volume. The injection of 2xlO\n6\n live cells in a large volume represents an extreme case scenario in which large amount of live cells are injected s.c. and spread over a large area. As a control, 2x10\n5\n non- transfected (parental) live F98 cells (100 μl) and 2x10\n6\n (1000 μl) live F98 cells were injected to rat littermates.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nFigures 18A-B shows that the F98-luciferase injected in both quantities and volumes show some initial spread in the s.c. area 2 days following injection. The tumors grew in only one location, reaching their maximal size by 10 days, and were all completely rejected by 23 days. The growth and the complete spontaneous rejection of the two doses - 2x10\n5\n and the 2x10\n6\n F98-luciferase inoculates had similar tumor growth and rejection dynamics.\n\n\nThe injected parental F98 tumor - both 2x10\n5\n (lOOμl) and 2x10\n6\n (lOOOμl) inoculate, showed similar growth and rejection dynamics to the F98-Luciferase transfected cells. The complete rejection, in similar growth dynamics to the F98- luciferase, of both doses of the parental F98 corroborates the F98-luciferase tumor model as a relevant model to follow tumor growth dynamics.\n\n\nThe IVIS system is more sensitive than eyes/hands as small residual tumors could be observed, on occasion, even 7-10 days after the tumors could not be observed visually or felt manually.\n\n\nNo distant organ metastases were observed in the immunocompetent rats in the two similar experiments conducted. Similarly, no s.c. tumor metastasis were found in any rats following the tumor's complete visually observed rejection (N=I l rats) or 7- 1Od thereafter. \n\n EXAMPLE 12\n\n\nFollow-up of intracranial tumor growth and its elimination by large proportion of the rats injected with live tumor cells s.c.\n\n\nThe following experiment was performed to follow dynamics of tumor cell growth and rejection following intracranial inoculation with F98-luciferase (luc) cells.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nTo follow the dynamics of tumor growth following intracranial challenge, groups of rats were inoculated subcutaneously either with 2x10\n5\n live F98-luc cells, or with 2x10\n6\n live F98-luc cells. After one month, all s.c. tumor inoculated rats lost their s.c. tumors, both visually, as measured by clippers, and as observed using the IVIS system. One month following s.c. inoculation, all rats and a control untreated group were challenged i.e. with 5x10\n3\n live F98-luc cells. Rats were followed using luciferase luminescence in the IVIS system each week.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nFigure 19 shows sequel head pictures of rats that had the median survival of their group or their subgroup. As can be observed, all the untreated animals (6/6) quickly succumbed to the i.e. tumor (mean±STD 22.8d±3d) with large tumors developing with very similar dynamics in all rats. From the animals that were injected subcutaneously with 2x10\n5\n live cells, one half (2/4) developed intracranial tumors. The tumors that developed in these animals grew at slower rate compared to those of the untreated group, as per observed tumor luminescence. Intracranial tumor size and luminescence in the F98-luc model highly correlates [Bryant, MJ. 2008. J Clin Neurosci 15:545-551] . The other half (2/4) of the 2xlO\n5\n F98-luc treated animals subgroup did not to develop any i.e. tumor by 41 days. None of the animals (3/3) that were injected s.c. with higher amount of live cells (2x10\n6\n cells) developed intracranial tumors. These results suggest that live cell immunization either slows or abrogates completely intracranial tumor growth. \n\n This experiment further shows that a dose-response effect to the live cells - the animals responded better to a s.c. inoculate of 2xlO\n6\n live cells than they did to a s.c. inoculate of 2x10\n5\n live cells.\n\n\nStatistical significance calculated for both the 2x10\n5\n s.c. F98-luc. treated group, and the 2x10\n6\n F98-luc treated group showed significant enhancement of survival as compared to the untreated group, with P values of 0.004 and 0.01 (Log-rank) respectively.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 13 Tumor breakdown to single cells\n\n\nThe following experiment was performed to find a reagent or a combination of reagents that would allow for glioma breakdown into a viable, high-quality preparation of single cell suspension.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nFive materials were assayed; DNase, Collagenase, Hyaluronidase, Papain and Dispase II. Tumor breakdown experiments were performed in the following way: Human glioma tumors were weighed, cut into small pieces using scissors and diluted in HBSS (+Ca +Mg) to 100 mg tumor pieces/ml. Enzymes were added to the tumors according to the concentrations set forth in Table 1, herein below. Dispase II and Papain were added as single reagents, while DNase and Collagenase were added in different concentrations, with or without Hyaluronidase. All cell preparations were gently triturated after 30 min, 60 min, and 2 hours using a Pasteur pipette.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\nSeveral experiments on human gliomas showed that the use of Dispase II as a single reagent produces high quality cell preparations with very high percentage of surviving cells (around 100 %). This was apparent when tumor pieces were incubated for 30 minutes or even up to 20 hours with dispase II. All combinations of DNase and Collagenase with or without Hyaloronidase produced good results but these were systematically inferior in comparison to the tumor breakdown results obtained with dispase II. \n\n All three concentrations of Dispase II used produced similar good breakdown results, although a 30-60 minutes incubation with low to medium concentrations of Dispase II produced the optimal tumor breakdown results.\n\n\nThe results are set forth in Table 1, herein below.\n\n\nTable I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 14 Tumor purification\n\n\nThe following experiment was performed to check the efficacy of using single cells obtained from brain tumors as a cell source of a vaccine as compared to using density gradient-separated cells obtained from the same tumor cell preparation.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nF98 tumor cells from tissue culture were run on a percoll gradient to determine their specific density. It was found to be between 1.05-1.06 g/ml. Next, rat brain tumors were collected, broken down using trypsin and ran on a discontinuous 3-step gradient.\n\n\n(1.08, 1.05, 1.00). Tumor cells were collected from between the 1.05 and 1.08 g/ml interphases. The cells were washed in PBS and injected (10\n5\n) into a group of rats. \n\n Another group of rats was injected with a similar number of live single cells from the tumor without separation on a percoll gradient.\n\n\nRESULTS Figure 20 represents a summary of two similar experiments. The figure shows that using nonpurified tumor cells as vaccine enhances median survival of rats to controls by 32 % (P=0.047 to control), while using percoll gradient separated cells as a vaccine inoculate enhances survival by almost twice that amount (60%) with a more highly significant P value (P=0.0009). FACS analysis of cells following the percoll purification step (not shown) showed that the purification was only partial, Notwithstanding, the separation stage still enhanced the vaccine efficiency.\n\n\nIt is appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment.

Description\n\n\n\n\n ANTIMALARIAL COMPOUNDS WITH FLEXIBLE SIDE-CHAINS\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/978,375, filed on October 8, 2007.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0002] The present invention relates to antimalarial compounds or antifolates for the treatment of malaria and methods of making and using the compounds.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0003] Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease that causes over 2.7 million deaths per year according to estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO). Malaria is a potentially fatal blood disease caused by a parasite that is transmitted to human and animal hosts by the Anopheles mosquito. There are four human parasites including Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum), Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax), Plasmodium malariae (P. malariae) and Plasmodium ovale (P. ovale) of which P. falciparum is responsible for most of the mortality in humans. P. falciparum is dangerous not only because it digests the red blood cell's hemoglobin, but also because it changes the adhesive properties of the cell it inhabits, which causes the cell to stick to the walls of blood vessels. This becomes dangerous when the infected blood cells stick to the blood vessels, obstructing blood flow.\n\n\n[0004] The life cycle of the malaria parasite in a human or animal begins when an infected mosquito injects malaria sporozoites into a new host during a blood meal. The sporozoites travel to the liver, where they invade hepatocytes (liver cells) and undergo a replication cycle which leads to the release of thousands of merozoites into the blood stream which happens approximately two weeks later. Released merozoites then invade red blood cells and undergo an intraerythrocytic cycle of development. During the first 48 hours after infecting a red blood cell, a parasite goes through several phases of development. The first phase is the ring stage, in which the parasite begins to metabolize hemoglobin. The next phase is the trophozoite stage, during which the parasite metabolizes most of the hemoglobin, gets larger, and prepares to produce more parasites. Finally, \n\n the parasite divides asexually to form a multinucleated schizont. At the end of the cycle, the red blood cell bursts open and the released merozoites invade new red blood cells (see Micro Worlds™ electronic science magazine; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of California). As the parasite matures inside the red blood cell, it modifies the adhesive properties of the cell it inhabits which becomes especially dangerous as these infected blood cells stick to the capillaries in the brain, obstructing blood flow, a condition called cerebral malaria. In addition, continuous rupturing of infected and uninfected blood red cells, the latter as a result of an immune-mediated mechanism, coupled to a reduction in the production of new red blood cells from the bone marrow (dyserythropoiesis) inevitably leads to anaemia.\n\n\n[0005] Drug resistant malaria has become one of the most important problems in malaria control. Clinical resistance in vivo has been reported to all antimalarial drugs except artemisinin and its derivatives. The WHO recommendations for the treatment of drug resistant infections include the use of artemisinins in combination with other classes of antimalarials. However, the high cost of these drugs limits their accessibility to poor countries. In some parts of the world, artemisinin drugs constitute the first line of treatment, and are used indiscriminately as monotherapy for self treatment of suspected uncomplicated malaria, which in turn increases the risk of developing drug resistance. The problem of drug resistance can be attributed primarily to increased selection pressures on P. falciparum in particular, due to indiscriminate and incomplete drug use for self treatment. Resistance to chloroquine in P. falciparum, first reported in Thailand in 1961 is now widespread in most malaria endemic countries. Resistance to the antifolates pyrimethamine and cycloguanil, arose soon after their deployment as antimalarials. The addition of sulfa compounds created drug combinations that in many cases proved effective against the resistant parasites, however, resistance arose due to these combinations as well. Several mechanisms can account for changes in drug susceptibility in the malaria parasites, for example, physiological adaptations due to non genetic changes, selection of previously existing drug resistant parasites from a mixed population under drug pressure, spontaneous mutation, mutation of extranuclear genes, or the existence of plasmid- like factors. \n\n [0006] Selection of mutants by the drags themselves appears to be an important mechanism. In an environment where sub-therapeutic levels of the antimalarial drags are present, those parasites which have resistance through their natural variation or through mutations clearly have an important biological advantage. This means that even though the resistant strains were initially in the minority, the continued drag mediated elimination of intra- specific competition from the non- resistant strains has allowed the resistant strains to attain numerical superiority, in fact, resistance to conventional antimalarial drags such as chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is widespread. Multidrug resistant P. falciparum malaria is highly prevalent in Southeast Asia, South America and Africa. Africa, which is the continent with the highest burden of the disease is also affected with increased mortality as a result (Roll Back Malaria, Facts on ACTs, WHO, January 2006). The majority of studies indicate that drag pressure selection is to blame for the emergence of resistant malaria. In genetically determined resistance, gametocytes from resistant parasite populations will be transmitted, promoting the spread of drag-resistant strains. Plasmodium parasites have extremely complex genomes, and the ease with which they can switch between the microenvironments in different hosts, and the metabolic changes required illustrates the difficulty in studying the exact modes of action of the antimalarial drags on parasite metabolism (The Biology of Malaria Parasites: Report of a WHO Scientific Group. WHO Technical Report Series, 1987). Examples of antimalarials that are associated with drag-resistance are the antibiotic doxycycline, certain antifolates such as proguanil, pyrimethamine and sulfonamides, quinolines such as chloroquine, mefloquine and quinine, and naphthoquinones such as atovaquone.\n\n\n[0007] Certain compounds such as 1,2-dihydrotriazines, 2,4-diaminopyrimidines and 2,4- diaminoquinazolines have been extensively studied as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a key enzyme for maintaining pools of reduced folates. In the malarial parasites, DHFR exists as a part of the bifunctional enzyme dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR- TS), and acts by reducing dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, which is subsequently converted to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. This cofactor is utilized by thymidylate synthase (TS) to produce deoxythymidylate, a component of DNA which is essential for DNA synthesis and cell growth. Inhibition of DHFR results in inhibition of DNA synthesis and in parasite death. These inhibitors, also known as antifolates, are therefore potentially useful drags against infectious agents, provided \n\n that they can selectively inhibit DHFR of the target parasites without substantially affecting the cells of the host.\n\n\n[0008] Inhibitors of DHFR, generally known as antifolates or antifols, which have been shown to be effective antimalarials, include cycloguanil (Cyc), a 1,2-dihydrotriazine and pyrimethamine (Pyr), a 2,4-diaminopyrimidine, and derivatives thereof, with different substituents on positions 1 and 2 of the dihydrotriazine, and on positions 5 and 6 of the diaminopyrimidine. Some compounds in these classes are also good inhibitors of bacterial DHFR, and have antibacterial activity. Although cycloguanil, pyrimethamine and other described 1,2-dihydrotriazine, 2,4-diaminopyrimidine and 2,4-diaminoquinazoline derivatives are effective against wild type malaria parasites, they are not effective in vivo after oral administration against antifolate-resistant parasites, which have been shown to bear mutations in the DHFR and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS). The degree of resistance generally increases with the number of DHFR mutations, prompting the need for novel drugs which are effective both against non-resistant and resistant strains of malaria parasites. Since the human host also has DHFR, these drugs must have selectivity for the parasite DHFR over the corresponding host enzyme, or inhibit it to a much lesser degree, as otherwise they may have toxicity to the host. Other characteristics of the drugs must also not lead to host toxicity. It is also preferable that these drugs do not have significant antibacterial activity, since they will have to be administered frequently in malaria endemic areas, to treat malaria re-infections, with the added danger of developing resistant strains of bacteria co-existing during the anti-malarial treatment.\n\n\n[0009] Specific 1,2-dihydrotriazine derivatives such as WR99210 and its prodrug PS-15 are known to be effective inhibitors for some drug-resistant strains of malaria in vitro, although they also show toxicity in animal models (see Knight et al, Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. (1982) 76:1-7) and their manufacturing involves the production of a highly toxic by-product, TCDD, which must be strictly controlled to a ppb level. Several compounds related to PS-15 have been synthesized and some have been under clinical trials (Jensen et al, J. Med. Chem. (2001) 44:3925-31; U.S. Patent No. 5,322,858 (1994); and Shearer et al, J. Med. Chem. (2005) 48:2805-2813). It was speculated that WR99210 binds to the DHFR, but the actual details of binding were unknown until a crystal structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex was reported revealing molecular interactions between \n\n WR99210 and Plasmodium falciparum DHFR (Yuvaniyama et al, Nat. Struct. Biol. (2003) 10:357-65). Despite their potent in vitro anti-P. falciparum activity against non-resistant and antifolate resistant strains, it is unclear whether such compounds will ever be developed as an effective treatment against malaria as a consequence of their poor oral bioavailability.\n\n\n[0010] Because of the increasing mortality associated with malaria, a need exists for better and more effective methods of disease control. In particular, a need exists for more effective treatment and prophylaxis against drug -resistant malaria, i.e., in the form of effective inhibitors of multiple mutant dihydrofolate reductase of Plasmodium falciparum. The present invention meets this and other needs.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0011] The present invention relates to antimalarial compounds or antifolates for the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria and methods of making and using the compounds. The antifolates act as novel inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) of Plasmodium falciparum in the treatment of malaria, including non-resistant and drug-resistant malaria.\n\n\n[0012] The present invention provides a compound of Formula I as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein R is hydrogen or C\n1-4\n alkyl,\n\n\nW is O or CH\n2,\n \n\n\nX is (CH\n2\n)\n2\n-\n4\n and is optionally substituted with one or more hydroxyl groups, and\n\n\nY is CH\n2\n, O, S, or N(Z), wherein Z is H or optionally substituted acyl, alkyl, or aryl or derivative thereof; and\n\n\nAr is optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl or derivative thereof; \n\n or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n[0013] In one embodiment, Ar is an optionally substituted aromatic ring, such as a substituted phenyl or naphthyl, or an optionally substituted heteroaromatic ring optionally selected from the group of quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, pyridyl, indolyl, triazolyl, benzoxazolyl, benzimidazolyl, indolinyl and benzo triazolyl. When Ar is an aromatic ring, it is optionally substituted by at least one group selected from acyl, benzoxazolyl, nitro, carboxyl, carboxyalkylC(l-3), carboxyalkylC(l-3)oxy, alkylC(l-3)oxycarbonylalkylC(l-3), alkylC(l- 3)oxycarbonylalkylC(l-3)oxy, tetrazolyl, tetrazolylalkylC(l-3) and tetrazolylalkylC(l-3)oxy.

In another embodiment, the drug-resistant strain (e.g., antifolate- resistant strain) of malaria is a strain that is resistant to at least one drag (e.g., anti-DHFR drag). Such antifolate drags include, but are not limited to, cycloguanil, chlorcycloguanil, and pyrimethamine. In one preferred embodiment, the antifolate-resistant strain of malaria has at least one mutation in its DHFR protein sequence, including 16(Ala->Val), 51(Asn->Ile), 59(Cys->Arg), 108(Ser->Asn), 108(Ser->Thr), and 164(ϋe->Leu).

In another preferred embodiment, the antifolate-resistant strain of malaria is a strain of malaria that has at least two mutations in its DHFR protein sequence, including 16(AIa-^VaI) and 108(Ser-^Thr). The treatment for uncomplicated malaria including intermittent and/or preventative treatment is preferably via an oral route. The treatment for complicated or severe malaria is preferably via a parenteral route. However, other forms of administration are also contemplated.\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n[0017] The present invention is best understood when read in conjunction with the accompanying figures, which serve to illustrate the preferred embodiments.

General Overview\n\n\n[0027] The present invention provides novel inhibitors which are effective against malaria, in particular antifolate-resistant malaria arising from mutations in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) of Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum). Known antifolate-resistant P. falciparum strains have mutations at positions 108 (serine to asparagine), 51 (asparagine to isoleucine), 59 (cysteine to arginine) and/or 164 (isoleucine to leucine). Another antifolate-resistant strain of P. falciparum carries mutations at positions 16 (alanine to valine) and 108 (serine to threonine). It is possible that they act not only on dihydrofolate reductase, but also on other targets in the malarial parasites or host responses leading to effective parasite killing. The antimalarial compounds of the present invention have relatively low toxicity to the mammalian host and are potent when administered in pharmaceutical compositions. One major advantage of the invention is that the novel compounds show little or no antibacterial activity and are, thus, highly unlikely to lead to resistant strains of bacteria.\n\n\nii.) Definitions\n\n\n[0028] The terms \"antifolates\", \"antifols\" and \"DHFR inhibitors\" are interchangeably used herein and, for the purpose of this invention, refer to compounds that can be used in the treatment or prophylaxis of malaria. These compounds are effective inhibitors of the mutant and wild-type dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) of Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum).\n\n\n[0029] The terms \"Plasmodium falciparum\" and \"P. falciparum\" are interchangeably used herein and refer to the parasite that is transmitted to human and animal hosts, resulting in the host showing one or more symptoms of malaria. More specifically, P. falciparum is a protozoan that causes malaria.\n\n\n[0030] The term \"acyl\" as used herein refers to a group of the form R C(=O)-, wherein R is for example H, C\n1-6\n alkyl, aryl, C\n1-6\n alkoxy, OH, NH\n2\n, NHR, or N(R)\n2\n, wherein R is C\n1-6\n alkyl or aryl. \n\n [0031] As used herein, the terms \"alkyl,\" \"alkenyl\" and \"alkynyl\" include straight-chain, branched- chain and cyclic monovalent hydrocarbyl radicals, and combinations of these, which contain only C and H when they are unsubstituted. Examples include methyl, ethyl, isobutyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentylethyl, 2-propenyl, 3-butynyl, and the like. The total number of carbon atoms in each such group is sometimes described herein, e.g., when the group can contain up to ten carbon atoms it can be represented as 1-lOC or as Cl-ClO or Cl-10. When heteroatoms (N, O and S typically) are allowed to replace carbon atoms as in heteroalkyl groups, for example, the numbers describing the group, though still written as e.g. C1-C6, represent the sum of the number of carbon atoms in the group plus the number of such heteroatoms that are included as replacements for carbon atoms in the ring or chain being described.\n\n\n[0032] Typically, the alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl substituents of the invention contain 1-lOC (alkyl) or 2-lOC (alkenyl or alkynyl). Preferably they contain 1-8C (alkyl) or 2-8C (alkenyl or alkynyl). Sometimes they contain 1-4C (alkyl) or 2-4C (alkenyl or alkynyl). A single group can include more than one type of multiple bond, or more than one multiple bond; such groups are included within the definition of the term \"alkenyl\" when they contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond, and are included within the term \"alkynyl\" when they contain at least one carbon-carbon triple bond.\n\n\n[0033] Alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups are often substituted to the extent that such substitution makes sense chemically. Typical substituents include, but are not limited to, halo, =0, =N-CN, =N- OR, =NR, OR, NR\n2\n, SR, SO\n2\nR, SO\n2\nNR\n2\n, NRSO\n2\nR, NRCONR\n2\n, NRCOOR, NRCOR, CN, COOR, CONR\n2\n, 0OCR, COR, and NO\n2\n, wherein each R is independently H, C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 heteroalkyl, C1-C8 acyl, C2-C8 heteroacyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 heteroalkenyl, C2-C8 alkynyl, C2-C8 heteroalkynyl, C6-C10 aryl, or C5-C10 heteroaryl, and each R is optionally substituted with halo, =0, =N-CN, =N-0R, =NR, OR, NR\n2\n, SR, SO\n2\nR\n'\n, SO\n2\nNR\n2\n, NRSO\n2\nR, NRCONR\n2\n, NR\n'\nCOOR , NR' COR\n'\n, CN, COOR\n1\n, CONR\n2\n, OOCR, COR, and NO\n2\n, wherein each R is independently H, C1-C8 alkyl. C2-C8 heteroalkyl, C1-C8 acyl, C2-C8 heteroacyl, C6-C10 aryl or C5-C10 heteroaryl. Alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups can also be substituted by C1-C8 acyl, C2-C8 heteroacyl, C6-C10 aryl or C5-C10 heteroaryl, each of which can be substituted by the substituents that are appropriate for the particular group. \n\n [0034] While \"alkyl\" as used herein includes cycloalkyl and cycloalkylalkyl groups, the term \"cycloalkyl\" may be used herein to describe a carbocyclic non-aromatic group that is connected via a ring carbon atom, and \"cycloalkylalkyl\" may be used to describe a carbocyclic non-aromatic group that is connected to the molecule through an alkyl linker. Similarly, \"heterocyclyl\" may be used to describe a non-aromatic cyclic group that contains at least one heteroatom as a ring member and that is connected to the molecule via a ring atom, which may be C or N; and \"heterocyclylalkyl\" may be used to describe such a group that is connected to another molecule through a linker. The sizes and substituents that are suitable for the cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heterocyclyl, and heterocyclylalkyl groups are the same as those described above for alkyl groups. As used herein, these terms also include rings that contain a double bond or two, as long as the ring is not aromatic.\n\n\n[0035] \"Aromatic\" moiety or \"aryl\" moiety refers to a monocyclic or fused bicyclic moiety having the well-known characteristics of aromaticity; examples include phenyl and naphthyl. Similarly, \"heteroaromatic\" and \"heteroaryl\" refer to such monocyclic or fused bicyclic ring systems which contain as ring members one or more heteroatoms selected from O, S and N. The inclusion of a heteroatom permits aromaticity in 5-membered rings as well as 6-membered rings. Typical heteroaromatic systems include monocyclic C5-C6 aromatic groups such as pyridyl, pyrimidyl, pyrazinyl, thienyl, furanyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, and imidazolyl, and the fused bicyclic moieties formed by fusing one of these monocyclic groups with a phenyl ring or with any of the heteroaromatic monocyclic groups to form a C8-C10 bicyclic group such as indolyl, benzimidazolyl, indazolyl, benzotriazolyl, isoquinolyl, quinolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzofuranyl, pyrazolopyridyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, cinnolinyl, and the like. Any monocyclic or fused ring bicyclic system which has the characteristics of aromaticity in terms of electron distribution throughout the ring system is included in this definition. It also includes bicyclic groups where at least the ring which is directly attached to the remainder of the molecule has the characteristics of aromaticity. Typically, the ring systems contain 5-12 ring member atoms. Preferably the monocyclic heteroaryls contain 5-6 ring members, and the bicyclic heteroaryls contain 8-10 ring members. \n\n [0036] Aryl and heteroaryl moieties may be substituted with a variety of substituents including C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 alkynyl, C5-C12 aryl, C1-C8 acyl, and heteroforms of these, each of which can itself be further substituted; other substituents for aryl and heteroaryl moieties include halo, OR, NR\n2\n, SR, SO\n2\nR, SO\n2\nNR\n2\n, NRSO\n2\nR, NRCONR\n2\n, NRCOOR, NRCOR, CN, COOR, CONR\n2\n, 00CR, COR, and NO\n2\n, wherein each R is independently H, C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 heteroalkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 heteroalkenyl, C2-C8 alkynyl, C2-C8 heteroalkynyl, C6-C10 aryl, C5-C10 heteroaryl, C7-C12 arylalkyl, or C6-C12 heteroarylalkyl, and each R is optionally substituted as described above for alkyl groups. The substituent groups on an aryl or heteroaryl group may of course be further substituted with the groups described herein as suitable for each type of such substituents or for each component of the substituent. Thus, for example, an arylalkyl substituent may be substituted on the aryl portion with substituents described herein as typical for aryl groups, and it may be further substituted on the alkyl portion with substituents described herein as typical or suitable for alkyl groups.\n\n\n[0037] \"Optionally substituted\" as used herein indicates that the particular group or groups being described may have no non-hydrogen substituents, or the group or groups may have one or more non-hydrogen substituents. If not otherwise specified, the total number of such substituents that may be present is equal to the number of H atoms present on the unsubstituted form of the group being described. Where an optional substituent is attached via a double bond, such as a carbonyl oxygen (=0), the group takes up two available valences, so the total number of substituents that may be included is reduced according to the number of available valences.\n\n\n[0038] The term \"strain\" refers to a specific genetic variant of a particular organism. In chemotherapy, microorganisms can be described as being drug resistant or non-resistant strains according to their susceptibility to a particular drug or therapy. Often, a drug-resistant strain will have one or more genetic mutations. A non-resistant strain is a strain that is normally fully responsive to a particular drug or therapy. Such a strain may or may not have genetic mutations. A resistant strain is a strain that is less responsive than a non-resistant strain to the same drug or therapy. \n\n [0039] The terms \"non-resistant\" and \"wild type\" are interchangeably used herein and refer to strains of the parasite that are normally fully responsive to a particular drag or therapy.\n\n\niii.) The Antimalarial Compounds\n\n\n[0040] In one aspect, the invention provides a series of novel antimalarial compounds which are effective against both, wild type- and drag-resistant-, including antifolate-resistant malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum). These compounds belong to the class of dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors. The novel compounds are based on Formula I as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0041] R in compounds of Formula (I) is H or C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl, and in some embodiments it is C\n1-4\n alkyl. In certain embodiments, R is ethyl or methyl; ethyl is sometimes preferred.\n\n\n[0042] W is sometimes O and sometimes it is CH\n2\n. In some preferred embodiments, W is O.\n\n\n[0043] Y is often CH\n2\n, O, S or NZ.\n\n\n[0044] X is a two to four carbon alkylene chain, (CH\n2\n)\n2\n-\n4\n, that may be substituted with a hydroxyl group.\n\n\n[0045] Ar is sometimes preferably a heterocyclic aromatic group such as quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, quinazolinyl, or quinoxalinyl. In some preferred embodiments, Ar is quinolinyl and in particular embodiments it is 4-quinolinyl.\n\n\n[0046] When Ar is an aromatic ring rather than a heteroaromatic group, it must be substituted by at least one group, and in some embodiments it is substituted by at least one group selected from the group consisting of acyl, benzoxazolyl, nitro, carboxyl, carboxyalkylC(l-3), carboxyalkylC(l-3)oxy, alkylC(l-3)oxycarbonylalkylC(l-3), alkylC(l- \n\n 3)oxycarbonylalkylC(l-3)oxy, tetrazolyl, tetrazolylalkylC(l-3) and tetrazolylalkylC(l-3)oxy; and Ar is optionally substituted by additional substituents or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In some embodiments, Ar is substituted by at least one group selected from the group consisting of CO\n2\nR, (CH\n2\n)\nI-3\nCOOR\n'\n, O(CH\n2\n)i\n-3\nCOOR, tetrazolyl, (CH\n2\n) i\n-3\n-tetrazolyl, and O(CH\n2\n)\n1-3\n-tetrazolyl, wherein R is H or C\n1\n^ alkyl. In another embodiment, Ar may be further substituted at one or more available positions by an optional substituent selected from alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, trifluoromethyl, aryl, substituted aryl, halogen, amino, substituted amino, alkoxy, aryloxy, hydroxyl, nitro and the like. Preferred optional substituents for Ar include halo, CF\n3\n, methoxy, and methyl, and Ar typically contains 0-2 and preferably 0 or 1 such optional substituents.\n\n\n[0047] When Ar is heteroaromatic ring, it may be substituted at one or more available positions by an alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, trifluoromethyl, aryl, substituted aryl, halogen, amino, substituted amino, alkoxy, aryloxy, hydroxyl, nitro and the like. Preferred substituents for Ar when it is a heteroaromatic ring include halo, CF\n3\n, methoxy, and methyl, and in some embodiments the heteroaromatic group represented by Ar is unsubstituted.\n\n\n[0048] The antimalarial compounds of the presented invention include their tautomers and pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound of Formula (I) admixed with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. In preferred embodiments, the excipient is not water. Where a chiral center is present in a compound of Formula (I), the invention includes each individual enantiomer or diastereomer of the compound as well as mixtures of enantiomers or diastereomers, including racemic mixtures.\n\n\n[0049] The invention also includes prodrugs that are readily transformed in vivo into a compound of Formula (I). Examples of these prodrugs include substituted derivatives wherein an amine nitrogen is substituted with an acyl group, typically a C1-C6 acyl group that may be substituted, and compounds wherein a carboxyl group is esterified into a C1-C6 alkoxycarbonyl group. Prodrugs substituted with an N acyl that is a C1-C4 acyl group or an acyl group derived from an amino acid \n\n such as glycine, alanine, serine, glutamine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, glutamate, aspartate, and the like, or dipeptides or tripeptides of these amino acids, are often preferred because they are readily deacylated by endogenous amidases and esterases.\n\n\n[0050] Further encompassed are the synthetic processes of making the above compounds. The synthetic processes of making 5-alkoxy-6-substituted-2,4-diarninopyrirnidines in certain embodiments involve (9-alkylation of 5-hydroxy-6-substituted-2,4-diaminopyrimidine with alkyl halide or alkyl mesylate in the presence of a base.\n\n\n[0051] In another aspect, the invention provides methods of using the compounds for the treatment of malaria, including non-resistant and drug-resistant strains of malaria. In a preferred embodiment, the disclosed compounds are effective inhibitors against both wild-type and resistant Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pf DHFR). Further contemplated is the use of the disclosed compounds, or a pharmaceutical composition or salt thereof, in the treatment of resistant malaria derived from Plasmodium falciparum carrying wild- type or mutant dihydrofolate reductase (pf DHFR), such as the mutant strains described herein having at least one mutation in the DHFR protein sequence, or other strains containing at least one of the point mutations described herein, and more preferably mutant strains containing at least two of the mutations described herein.\n\n\niv.) Synthesis of the Antimalarial Compounds\n\n\n[0052] The flexible side-chain part of the compounds wherein Ar is a heteroaromatic group is preferably constructed by an alkylation reaction of Ar or ArOH with an alkylating agent as illustrated in Scheme 1 below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 1\n\n\n[0053] Suitable alkylating agents that produce an alkylated compound useful in synthesis of compounds of Formula (I) are well known. For example, 1,3-dibromopropane or l-bromo-3- chloropropane can be used in the reactions illustrated above to make compounds having the Formula Ar-(CHi)\n3\n-Br or Ar-O-(CHi)\n3\n-Br. These intermediates are readily used to alkylate a 5- hydroxy group on a 2,4-diaminopyrimidine to provide compounds of Formula (I). Suitable leaving groups (LG) include, but are not limited to, chemicals such as chloride, bromide, iodide, mesylate, benzenesulfonate, tosylate, and triflate. The variations of this type of reaction would be readily apparent to those of skill in the art. Suitable nucleophiles include, but are not limited to, phenols, other aryl and heteroaryl alcohols, aryl and heteroaryl thiols, thiophenol, aryl and heteroaryl amines, and heteroaromatic compounds that are readily alkylated on a ring atom such as indoles, triazoles, imidazoles, and their substituted derivatives and conjugated bases.\n\n\n[0054] When selective monoalkylation is more difficult to achieve, it is also possible to start from a ω-halogenated alcohol such as 2-bromoethanol, 3-bromopropanol or 3-chloropropanol in place of the bis-electrophile. In that case the OH group in the intermediate alcohol should be changed to a more reactive leaving group provided that it is compatible with the structures of the other parts of the molecule. For example, bromination can be affected by PBr\n3\n, aq HBr, Ph\n3\nPBr\n2\n, CBr\n4\n/Ph\n3\nP, NBS/Ph\n3\nP while mesylation can be affected by MsCl/Et\n3\nN. Alternatively, a Mitsunobu reaction \n\n (DEAD/PI1\n3\nP or DIAD/PI1\n3\nP) between the halogenated alcohol and the nucleophile (ArYH) allows for a direct synthesis of the necessary intermediate having a reactive side chain linked to Ar.\n\n\n[0055] Once the reactive side chain containing Ar is synthesized, a further alkylation reaction of the Ar-(CH\n2\n) i-\n4\n-LG species with 5-hydroxy-6-substituted-2,4-diaminopyrimidines in the presence of a base yields the compounds of the present invention. 5-Hydroxy-6-substituted-2,4- diaminopyrimidines are readily available from commercial sources. The base can be selected from LiH, LiOH, KOH, NaH and K\n2\nCO\n3\n, wherein the most preferred base is LiOH. The base can be added at 1-10 equivalents relative to the hydroxypyrimidines. The reaction is preferably carried out in an inert solvent, wherein iV,iV-dimethylformamide is the preferred solvent. The reaction can be carried out between about 25-80 \n0\nC but preferably at 25-30 \n0\nC. For a more detailed description of the reaction see the following patents and publications incorporated herein by reference in their entirety (i.e., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,179,562 and 4,374,136; GB 2086386). Other methods for making compounds of this general structure are well known in the art, and are readily adapted for preparation of these compounds by the skilled practitioner.\n\n\n[0056] The final products can be isolated and purified by conventional techniques such as evaporation, extraction, crystallization and/or column chromatography. Hydrochloride and other pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of Formula (I) are readily prepared by admixing the compound with an appropriate acid corresponding to the desired salt, as is well known in the art. The acid is often added to a solution or suspension of the compound of Formula (I) in a solvent comprising water, methanol and/or ethanol, followed by evaporation to remove any undesired solvent. The diaminopyrimidines are often converted to a di-salt such as a dihydrochloride salt.\n\n\nv.) Pharmaceutical Compositions and Formulations of the Antimalarial Compounds\n\n\n[0057] The antimalarial compounds or antifolates may be formulated as pharmaceuticals to be used in the methods of the invention. A composition or compound that can stimulate a biological response associated with the binding of the antimalarial compound to wild type and mutant {e.g., single mutant, multiple mutant) dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) of P. falciparum in drug resistant \n\n and non-resistant malaria can be used as a pharmaceutical in the invention. Examples of such general details on techniques for formulation and administration are well described in the scientific literature (see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Maack Publishing Co., Easton Pa.). Antifolate pharmaceutical formulations can be prepared according to any method known in the art for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. The antifolates used in the methods of the invention can be formulated for administration in any conventionally acceptable way including via oral administration and via parenteral routes. Oral administration is preferred for treatment of uncomplicated malaria while parenteral administration is preferred for treatment of complicated (severe) malaria. Illustrative examples are set forth below.\n\n\nTable 1: Anti-malarial activity and oral bioavailability of triazines compared to pyrimidine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0058] Table 1 above shows the anti-malarial activity and oral bioavailability of conventional dihydrotriazines compared to conventional pyrimidine. Although WR99210 is active against non- resistant and pyrimethamine resistant strains of P. falciparum parasites in vitro and in vivo after subcutaneous administration to mice infected with P. chabaudi AS, its efficacy is substantially reduced if the compound is administered by the oral route (i.e., high ED\n90\n value). This reduction has been found to be due to the poor oral bioavailability of WR99210 compared to cycloguanil and pyrimethamine. \n\n Table 2: Antibacterial activities of the novel 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivative compounds compared to trimethoprim and pyrimethamine.\n\n\nMinimal inhibitory concentration (μM)\n\n\nCompounds\n\n\nS. aureus E. coli\n\n\nTrimethoprim 1 < MIC < 10 1 < MIC < 10 Pyrimethamine > 50 > 50 P135 > 50 > 50 P149 1 < MIC < 10 10< MIC < 50 P153 10< MIC < 50 10< MIC < 50 P154 > 50 10< MIC < 50 P157 > 25 > 25 P171 > 50 > 50\n\n\n[0059] In comparison, Table 2 above shows the anti-bacterial activities of the new 2,4- diaminopyrimidine derivative compounds of the present invention. These selected compounds are inactive against S. aureus and E. coli and require very high micromolar concentrations to completely inhibit bacterial growth on agar plates, whereas other 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivatives such as trimethoprim are clinically efficacious antibiotics.\n\n\n[0060] Pharmaceutical formulations and preparations for oral administration can be prepared using pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art in dosages suitable for oral administration. Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical formulations to be formulated in unit dosage forms as tablets, pills, powder, capsules, liquids, lozenges, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions, and the like, suitable for ingestion by the patient. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be prepared by combining antifolate compounds with a solid excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable additional compounds, if desired, to obtain tablets or pills. Suitable solid excipients are carbohydrate or protein fillers which include, but are not limited to, sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; starch from corn, wheat, rice, potato, or other plants; cellulose such as methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, or sodium carboxymethylcellulose; and gums including arabic and tragacanth; as well as proteins such as gelatin and collagen. If desired, disintegrating or solubilizing \n\n agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, alginic acid, or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate.\n\n\n[0061] Pharmaceutical preparations of the invention that can also be used orally are, for example, push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a coating such as glycerol or sorbitol. Push-fit capsules can contain antifolate mixed with a filler or binders such as lactose or starches, lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate, and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the antifolate compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycol with or without stabilizers.\n\n\n[0062] Aqueous suspensions of the invention contain an antifolate in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylnethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethylene oxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitol mono-oleate), or a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension can also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, aspartame or saccharin. Formulations can be adjusted for osmolality.\n\n\n[0063] Oil suspensions can be formulated by suspending an antifolate in a vegetable oil, such as arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oil suspensions can contain a thickening agent, such as beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents can be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These formulations can be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid. \n\n [0064] Dispersible powders and granules of the invention suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water can be formulated from an antifolate in admixture with a dispersing, suspending and/or wetting agent, and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those disclosed above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, can also be present.\n\n\n[0065] The pharmaceutical formulations of the invention can also be in the form of oil-in- water emulsions. The oily phase can be a vegetable oil, such as olive oil or arachis oil, a mineral oil, such as liquid paraffin, or a mixture of these. Suitable emulsifying agents include naturally-occurring gums, such as gum acacia and gum tragacanth, naturally occurring phosphatides, such as soybean lecithin, esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, such as sorbitan mono-oleate, and condensation products of these partial esters with ethylene oxide, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate. The emulsion can also contain sweetening and flavoring agents. Syrups and elixirs can be formulated with sweetening agents, such as glycerol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations can also contain a demulcent, a preservative, a flavoring or a coloring agent.\n\n\n[0066] When the drugs are delivered by intravenous or other parenteral routes via injection, the antifolate pharmaceutical formulations of the invention can be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous solution. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution in a nontoxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent. In addition, sterile fixed oils can conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid can likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\nvi.)

The structures of specific compounds complexed with the wild-type and the quadruple mutant enzyme were determined through X-ray diffraction via a known procedure (see Yuvaniyama et al, (2003) Nat. Struct. Biol. 10:357-365). This process provides spatial and electronic information about the DHFR active site that was used in the design and optimization of chemical compounds with high affinity and specificity for wild type and quadruple mutant P. falciparum DHFR. Using iterative cycles, new designed inhibitors could be synthesized, co-crystallized with the DHFR enzyme and studied using x-ray diffraction to provide an experimental determination of exactly how each compound binds at the DHFR active site. Based on these data, structural modifications of the inhibitor can then be made to further enhance binding to the target enzyme. This led to the understanding of the basic requirements that are needed for effective binding of the compounds to the active site of the \n\n enzyme, i.e., the wild-type and resistant mutant enzyme as described in Example 11 below. The affinities of the compounds for the wild-type and mutant enzymes were measured as K\n1\n values (see Example 12). The inhibitory activities against Plasmodium falciparum were measured by an in vitro method (see Example 13). In addition, the cytotoxicity of the compounds was measured and determined to be minimal (see Example 14). In vivo activities of the compounds against P. chabaudi AS and ASP (i.e. pyrimethamine sensitive and pyrimethamine resistant strains respectively) were also measured following oral administration (see Example 15). The bioavailability of the compounds in rats and mice were measured in Example 16. The obtained results were then considered together in order to optimize the properties of the compounds: high binding affinity to wild type and mutant DHFR enzymes (low ^\n1\n value), effective antimalarial activities against both P. falciparum in vitro, specially the antifolate resistant parasites (low /C\n50\n value) and P. chabaudi in vivo (low ED\n90\n value), and good oral bioavailability of the compounds.\n\n\nExample 11: Basic Requirements of Effective Compounds.\n\n\n[00111] The compounds were designed such that they have the general formula of Het-X-R\n\n\n(I), where -X-R is a flexible side chain of a heterocyclic ring selected from pyrimidine, 1,3,5- triazine, quinazoline, and saturated or partially saturated analogues thereof. The flexibility was needed so that any steric hindrance between the side chain and the mutated residue at position 108 (serine to asparagine) of the mutant enzyme could be avoided. Moreover, other mutations caused further changes in the active site which required further optimization of the side chain. The compounds with good affinities for the targets (see Examples 3 and 8) were shown to be active, both in vitro and in vivo and further shown to be sufficiently bioavailable.\n\n\nExample 12: Enzyme Inhibitory Activities.\n\n\n[00112] The present invention provides 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivative compounds, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzymes of P. falciparum including, wild type (WT), double mutants (C59R+S108N), triple mutants (N51I+C59R+S108N, C59R+S108N+I164L), and quadruple mutants (N51I+C59R+S108N+I164L). WT, double-, triple-, and quadruple mutants were prepared with the help of an E. coli expression \n\n system (E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS) containing the corresponding genes. The activity of the enzymes was determined spectrophotometrically at 25 \n0\nC. The reaction (1 mL) contained IxDHFR buffer (50 mM TES, pH 7.0, 75 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/mL Bovine Serum Albumin), 100 μM each of the substrate dihydrofolate and cofactor NADPH, and appropriate amount of affinity-purified enzyme to initiate the reaction (0.001-0.005 units in phosphate buffer containing 50 mM KCl).\n\n\n[00113] The inhibition of the various enzymes (e.g., WT, double-, triple-, and quadruple mutant, supra) by the compounds was investigated in a 96 well plate with 200 μL of the above mixture in the presence of antifolate. The kinetics was followed at 340 nm. The Ki values of the inhibitors for the wild type and mutant enzymes were determined by using the following equation:\n\n\n[00114] IC50 = Ki (1+([S]/Km)), where IC50 is the concentration of inhibitor which inhibits\n\n\n50% of the enzyme activity under the standard assay condition and Km is the Michaelis constant for the substrate dihydrofolate.\n\n\n[00115] The inhibition constants (Ki) of the compounds against the wild type and mutant enzymes of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf DHFR) are summarized in Table 3 below. Low values of Ki indicate avid binding, consistent with the X-ray co-crystal structures which show optimal interactions between the compounds and the enzyme active sites, including hydrophobic, van de Waals, polar and charge-charge interactions. For example, introduction of a carboxylic side chain provides additional binding with Rl 22 in the active site, thus giving a lower Ki-value than its comparator without a carboxylic side chain.\n\n\nTable 3: Inhibition Constants (KO of 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivative compounds for binding with wild type and mutant Pf DHFRs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n nd = not determined\n\n\nExample 13: In vitro Activity Against P. falciparum.\n\n\n[00116] The invention provides 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivative compounds for treatment of malaria, including non-resistant and drug-resistant malaria. The compounds can be used alone or in combination with sulfonamides, which act on the DHPS enzyme in the folate biosynthetic pathway, and/or other agents which may act through a non-antifolate mechanism. P. falciparum strains were maintained continuously in human erythrocytes at 37 \n0\nC under 3% CO\n2\nIn standard RPMI 1640 culture media supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2% NaHCO\n3\n, 40 μg/mL gentamicin and 10% human serum (Trager et al., (1976) Science 193: 673-675). In vitro antimalarial activity was determined by using the [\n3\nH]-hypoxanthine incorporation method (Desjardins et al, (1979) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 16:710-718), which measures parasite growth through accumulation of a metabolic precursor, hypoxanthine. The compounds were initially dissolved in DMSO and diluted with the same standard culture media Aliquots (25 μL) of the drug of different concentrations were dispensed in 96-well plates and 200 μL of 1.5% cell suspension of parasitized erythrocytes containing 1-2% parasitemia were added. The final concentration of DMSO (0.1%) did not affect the parasite growth. The mixtures were incubated in a 3% CO\n2\n incubator at 37 \n0\nC. After 24 h of incubation, 25 μL (0.25 μCi) of [\n3\nH] -hypoxanthine were added to each well. The parasite cultures were further incubated under the same condition for 18-20 hours. DNA of parasites was harvested onto glass filter paper. The filters were air-dried and 20 μL liquid scintillation fluid was added. The radioactivity on the filters was then measured using a microplate scintillation counter. The concentration of inhibitor which inhibited 50% of the parasite growth (/C\n50\n) was determined from the sigmoid curve obtained by plotting the percentages of [\n3\nH]- hypoxanthine incorporation against drug concentrations. Examples of the compounds in this series \n\n with active antimalarial activity against wild type DHFR and, in particular, against parasites carrying single-, double-, triple-, and quadruple mutant DHFR enzymes are shown in Table 3 above.\n\n\n[00117] Table 4 below shows the results obtained with the following mutant strains: KlCBl\n\n\n(C59R+S108N), W2 (N51I+C59R+S108N), Csl-2 (C59R+S108N+I164L) and Vl/S (N51I+C59R+S108N+I164L).\n\n\nTable 4: Anti-plasmodial activities (/C50) of 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivative compounds against P. falciparum carrying various DHFR types: TM4/8.2 (wild type), KlCBl (C59R+S108N), W2 (N51I+C59R+S108N), Csl-2 (C59R+S108N+I164L), and Vl/S (N51I+C59R+S108N+I164L).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n nd = not determined\n\n\n[00118] Table 4 above shows various 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivative compounds.\n\n\nNotably, these compounds are very active against pyrimethamine -resistant parasite strains.

Natl. Cancer Inst. 82: 1107- 1112. These compounds have selectivity against malaria parasites with different cytotoxic effect on the mammalian cell line as summarized in Table 5.

Briefly, 20gr CDl male mice (Charles Rivers, UK) were kept in specific pathogen-free conditions and fed ad libitum. For oral administration, compounds were dissolved in standard suspending formula (SSV) [0.5% sodium carboxymethylcellulose, 0.5% benzyl alcohol, 0.4% Tween 80, 0.9% NaCl (all Sigma)] and for intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration compounds were dissolved in 0.5% w/v hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, 0.4% v/v Tween 80, 0.5% v/v benzyl alcohol in de-ionised water]. Mice were infected intravenously with 4 x 10 infected red cells and treated orally (p.o.) with 0.2 ml of a solution of the test compounds two hours (day 0) and on days 1, 2 and 3 post- infection. Parasitaemia was determined by microscopic examination of Giemsa stained blood films taken on day 4. Microscopic counts of blood films from each mouse were processed using GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA, USA) and expressed as percentages of inhibition from the arithmetic mean parasitaemias of each group in relation to the untreated group. Compounds were tested in an \n\n initial screening at 30mg/kg/day against P. chabaudi AS (non-resistant) over the period described and percentages of inhibition calculated in relation to the untreated controls. Compounds giving 80% inhibition or above were then tested in the same model under a range of doses over the period described in order to obtain dose response curves and calculate their ED\n50\n and ED\n90\n values. Compounds giving an ED\n90\n at or below the level of the comparator (Table 6) were then selected for testing against P. chabaudi ASP (pyrimethamine-resistant strain), and in the lethal P. berghei ANKA (non-resistant strain). The results of the in vivo tests against P. chabaudi AS are summarized in Table 7. From the ED\n90\n values is clear that a number of compounds have exquisite activity in this model and are also tested in P. chabaudi ASP and P. berghei ANKA.\n\n\n[00121] As shown in Table 6, a number of these compounds show ED\n90\n values 2-90-fold lower (ED\n90\n = 0.01-0.36 mg/kg) than the existing drug pyrimethamine which displays ED\n90\n values of 0.88 mg/kg against P. chabaudi AS. Table 7 shows the efficacy of some of these compounds in three different models of rodent malaria including P. chabaudi ASP and the lethal P. berghei ANKA. Compared to pyrimethamine which is 15 times less efficacious against pyrimethamine resistant /\n3\n, chabaudi ASP (ED\n90\n = 13.5 mg/kg), compound Pl 13 retains its efficacy against this strain (ED\n90\n = 0.01 mg/kg) and against the lethal P. berghei ANKA (ED\n90\n = 0.03 mg/kg).\n\n\nTable 6: Anti-malarial oral activity of compounds against P. chabaudi AS in the standard 4- dav Peters' Test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n*\n ED50/90: dose required to produce a 50% /90% reduction in parasitaemia nd = not determined \n\n\n\nTable 7: Summary of oral anti-malarial activity of compounds against different rodent malaria models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* ED\n50\nZ\n9O\n \n1\n dose required to produce a 50% /90% reduction in parasitaemia nt = not tested\n\n\nExample 16: Bioavailability.\n\n\n[00122] To assess the oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, test compounds were administered to fasted male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 270-300 g (see Table 8 below). Rats had free access to water throughout the pre- and post-dose sampling period, and access to food was re-instated 4 hours post-dosing. Test compounds were administered intravenously as a 5 minute constant rate infusion (1.0 niL per rat) and orally by gavage (1.0 mL per rat). The IV formulations were typically buffered aqueous solutions containing a co-solvent if required for solubilization. The oral formulations were prepared as suspensions in hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose or carboxymethyl cellulose, each with the addition of Tween 80 and benzyl alcohol. Samples of arterial blood and total urine were collected up to 24 hours post-dose. Arterial blood was collected directly into borosilicate vials (at 4 \n0\nC) containing heparin, a protease inhibitor cocktail, potassium fluoride, and EDTA to minimise the potential for ex vivo degradation of the test compound in blood/plasma \n\n samples. Once collected, blood samples were centrifuged, supernatant plasma was removed and stored at -20\n0\nC, and plasma concentrations of test compound were determined by LCMS.\n\n\nTable 8. Pharmacokinetic parameters for selected compounds determined following Lv. and oral dosing to male Sprague Dawley rats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00123] The data in Table 8 shows the different pharmacokinetic profiles and bioavailability properties of the various compounds. There is a range of values in terms of oral bioavailability, clearance, tm and V\nD\n for the individual compounds.\n\n\n[00124] In a separate study, the oral bioavailability of P195, the ester pro-drug of P218 which contains a carboxylic acid side chain was investigated in mice. Male Swiss outbred mice were administered P218 (the free acid) intravenously by bolus tail vein injection at a nominal dose of 5 mg/kg and P195 (the ester pro-drug) orally by gavage at a nominal dose of 20 mg/kg. Dosing formulations were comparable to those used in the rat studies described above. Blood sampling was conducted by cardiac puncture with a single sample per mouse, and two mice per time point over 16 hours post dosing. Blood samples were separated and plasma analyzed by LCMS as described above. The plasma concentration versus time profiles for P218 following IV administration of P218 \n\n and following oral administration of the pro-drug P 195 are shown in Figure 9. Plasma concentrations of P218 remained above the lower limit of quantitation (LLQ = 0.0014 μM) for 7.5 h following IV administration. Following oral administration of the ester prodrug, plasma concentration of the acid P218 remained above the LLQ for 16 hours post dosing, and the bioavailability of P218 was approximately 50% (determined by comparison of the dose normalized AUC value for P218 following oral administration of P195 to the AUC for P218 following IV administration of P218). The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of P218 following oral administration of P195 was observed at the time of the first blood sample (15 min) and plasma concentrations of the pro-drug P195 were below the lower limit of quantitation (0.0014 μM) at all time points. These results suggest rapid absorption and cleavage of the ester prodrug following oral administration to liberate the acid P218.\n\n\n[00125] Various modifications and variations of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Although the invention has been described in connection with specific preferred embodiments, it should be understood that the invention as claimed should not be unduly limited to such specific embodiments. Indeed, various modifications of the described modes for carrying out the invention which are understood by those skilled in the art are intended to be within the scope of the claims."

Description\n\n\n\n\n ESTROGENIC EXTRACTS OF Rheum palmatum L of the Pofygonaceae family AND USES\n\n\nTHEREOF\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/970,776, filed September 07, 2007, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0002] The present invention relates to plant extract compositions, and more particularly to compositions comprising extracts of plant species belonging to the species Rheum palmatum L of the Pofygonaceae family. The invention further relates to methods of using and methods of making such plant extract compositions.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n[0003] Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been used successfully to treat a variety of conditions, such as osteoporosis, increased risk of cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women and climacteric symptoms, such as hot flashes, decreased libido and depression. However, HRT with estradiol (E\n2\n), either alone or in combination with progestin, can lead to undesirable effects. In fact, a recent Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study was abruptly halted when preliminary results showed that HRT was associated with a 35% increased risk of breast cancer. [0004] Breast cancer can be treated or prevented by using a so-called selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), such as tamoxifen. (Before the approval of tamoxifen, breast cancer treatment of pre-menopausal women often included removing the ovaries in order to reduce the cancer-stimulating effect of estrogen.) Tamoxifen appears to selectively block the cancer-inducing effects of estrogen in breast tissues of pre-menopausal women. Another SERM, raloxifene, has been approved for treatment of osteoporosis as an alternative to estrogen replacement. In addition to selectively inducing estrogenic effects in bone tissue, long-term administration of raloxifene was also shown to be associated with reduction in the rate of breast cancer in the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) study. [0005] While SERMs such as tamoxifen and raloxifene provide selective reduction in estrogen's cancer- inducing effects in the breast, they are not without their risks. For example both tamoxifen and raloxifene therapy have been associated with increased incidence of hot flushes, and tamoxifen therapy has been shown to increase the risk of uterine (endometrial) cancer.\n\n\n[0006] Despite the success of estrogen replacement therapy in treating osteoporosis, coronary heart disease and climacteric symptoms, and of SERMs like tamoxifen and raloxifene in treating breast cancer and osteoporosis, there remains a need for compositions having estrogenic properties. Additionally, given the increasing cost of producing drug compounds, there is a need for additional estrogenic compositions that may be obtained from natural sources. \n\n a ious cu ivars o eum pa ma um o e o ygonaceae ami y are grown in rnna in\n\n\nQinghai, Gansu and Tibet provinces\n.\n. Various other varieties grow all over the world. The root is collected in the late autumn when the plant is withering or in the spring before sprouting. It is washed clean, rootlets are removed, decorticated, cut and dried.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0008] The current inventor had identified a need for new estrogenic compositions. In particular, the present inventor has recognized a need for estrogenic compositions useful for treating hot flashes or other climacteric symptoms, osteoporosis or other disorders or disease states associated with low estrogen associated with menopause or perimenopause.

Accordingly, suitable in vivo methods include treatment and/or prevention of medical indications that are responsive to antagonism of E\n2\n-stimulated activation of gene expression. Suitable in vitro methods include use in methods of activating a gene under control of the estrogen response element (ERE) and methods of repressing expression of a gene under control of the tumor necrosis factor response element (TNF RE). The invention further provides methods of making the inventive extracts. [0024J Breast neoplasms are the most common cancers diagnosed in women. In 2000, 184,000 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed and 45,000 women died from breast cancer. Although the cause of breast cancer is probably multifactorial, there is compelling clinical, epidemiological and biological research that indicate estrogens promote breast cancer: (a) Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is associated with a 35% increased risk of breast cancer by a meta-analysis of 51 studies; (b) Breast cancer can be prevented with tamoxifen or raloxifene, which bind to ERs and antagonize the actions of estrogens in breast cells; (c) Bilateral oophorectomy in premenopausal women with breast cancer leads to increased survival; (d) Greater exposure to estrogens (early menarche or late menopause, relative risk = 1.3 and 1.5 to 2.0, respectively) increases the incidence of breast cancer; (e) Estrogens increase the proliferation of ER positive breast cancer cells; and (f) Estrogens increase the production of growth promoting genes, such as cyclin Dl, c-myc, and c-fos.\n\n\n[0025] Approximately 60-70% of breast tumors contain estrogen receptors. For several decades, breast tumors have been analyzed for the presence of ERs. Approximately 70% of ER+ tumors are responsive to antiestrogen therapy. This observation has led to the notion that ER+ tumors have a better prognosis than ER negative tumors. However, the discovery of ERβ has complicated these interpretations and has raised some profound clinical questions. Understanding the role of ERa and ERβ is of paramount importance, because the current methods of determining whether tumors are ER+ uses an antibody that only detects ERa. Thus, most studies examining the effects ERs in breast tumors on clinical outcomes reflect the only ERa status. However, several recent studies have detected the presence of ERβ mRNA in human breast tumors. Most of the studies relied on RT-PCR to measure ERβ, because of the lack of specific and sensitive antibodies to ERβ. Dotzlaw et al. were the first to detect ERβ in breast tumor biopsies by RT-PCR. They found 70% of the breast tumors expressed ERβ and 90% expressed ERa. Furthermore, they demonstrated that several ER negative cell lines also express ERβ mRNA. These \n\n n ings sugges a p is ig y expresse in reas umors, an a o a an p are o en coexpressed in many tumors. In fact, some ER - tumors contain ERβ. Dotzlaw et al. also showed that ERβ mRNA is significantly lower in ER+/PR- (PR being progestin receptor) tumors compared to ER+/PR+ tumors. The authors suggested that this observation indicates that ERβ expression is associated with a poorer prognosis, because ER+/PR+ are more likely to respond to tamoxifen. Other studies suggest that the presence of ERβ confers a poor prognosis. Speirs et al. found that most breast tumors express ERβ mRNA alone or in combination with ERa mRNA. Those tumors that express both ERa and ERβ mRNA were associated with positive lymph nodes and tended to be characterized as higher grade tumors. Furthermore, increased ERβ expression occurs in MCF-IOF cells treated with chemical carcinogens, suggesting that the expression of ERβ may contribute to the initiation and progression of breast cancer. Recently, Jensen et al. analyzed the expression of ERβ in 29 invasive breast tumors by immunohistochemistry (IHC). They found that ERβ expression was associated with an elevation of specific markers of cell proliferation, Ki67 and cyclin A. Moreover, the highest expression of these proliferation markers was present in ERα+/ERβ + tumors. Although the number of ERα-TERβ + cases were very small (n = 7) the authors suggested that ERβ mediates cell proliferation in breast tumors. Speirs et al. also reported ERβ mRNA is significantly elevated in the tamoxifen-resistant tumors compared to tamoxifen-sensitive tumors.\n\n\n[0026] In contrast, other studies indicate that the presence of ERβ confers a favorable prognosis. Iwao et al. demonstrated that ERa mRNA is up-regulated and ERβ mRNA is down-regulated as breast tumors progress from preinvasive to invasive tumors. Using IHC of frozen tumor sections Jarvinen et al. found that ERβ expression was associated with negative axillary node status, low grade, and low S-phase fraction. A study by Omoto et al. also found that ERβ positive tumors correlated with a better prognosis than ERβ negative tumors, because the disease-free survival rate was higher in tumors containing ERβ. ERβ expression also showed a strong association with the presence of progesterone receptors and well- differentiated breast tumors. It has also been reported that the levels of ERβ are highest in normal mammary tissue and that it decreases as tumors progress from pre-cancerous to cancerous lesions. These studies indicate that ERβ may function as a tumor suppressor and that the loss of ERβ promotes breast carcinogenesis, hi a study by Mann et al. it was shown that the expression of ERβ in more than 10% of cancer cells was associated with better survival in women treated with tamoxifen. The aggregate of these studies indicates the presence of ERβ confers a favorable prognosis. Consistent with RT-PCR and IHC data is a report that showed that adenovirus-mediated expression of ERβ resulted in a ligand-independent inhibition of proliferation of the ER negative cell line, MDA-MB-231.\n\n\n[0027] These results demonstrate that the role of ERβ in the pathogenesis and prognosis of breast cancer is unclear. Several reasons may explain the apparent discrepancy among these studies. First, there may be a poor correlation between ERβ mRNA and ERβ protein. This notion is consistent with the presence of ERβ mRNA in some ER negative cell lines that do not have detectable ERs by ligand binding assays. \n\n , i s ave een poor y characterized for specificity and sensitivity. Third, most of the conclusions have been based on a few breast cancer cases. Clearly, more studies are needed to clarify the role of ERa and ERβ in breast cancer. [0028] Role of SERMs as adjuvant therapy and chemoprevention in breast cancer: Because estrogens promote the proliferation of breast cancer cells, several therapeutic approaches have been implemented to block this effect of estrogens on breast tumors. These strategies, including ovarian ablation, antiestrogens, gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs or aromatase inhibitors, work by either decreasing the production of estrogens or blocking the action of estrogens. All of these strategies non-selectively block the action of both ERa and ERβ. The most common approach used clinically to prevent and treat breast tumors are the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), tamoxifen and raloxifene.\n\n\n[0029] Tamoxifen is a non-steroidal triphenylethylene derivative that is the prototype SERM, because it exhibits antagonistic action in some tissues, such as the breast, but has agonist actions in other tissues such as the endometrium and bone. Tamoxifen has been extensively studied for its clinical effectiveness as an adjuvant therapy to reduce the recurrences of breast tumors in women with estrogen receptor- positive breast cancer. Five years of tamoxifen therapy reduces the risk of recurrences by 42%, mortality from breast cancer by 22% and a second contralateral primary breast tumor. Approximately, 2/3 of ER positive breast tumors respond to tamoxifen, whereas very little evidence indicates that women with ER negative tumors benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen. Most recently, the U.S. Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) demonstrated that tamoxifen reduces the risk of primary invasive breast cancer by 49% in women considered to be at high risk for breast cancer. These studies demonstrate that tamoxifen is a first-line effective adjuvant therapy in women with a history of breast cancer and is an effective chemoprevention agent for women who are high risk for developing breast cancer.\n\n\n[0030] Raloxifene is a member of the benzothiophene class of SERMs that has recently been approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Raloxifene has not been evaluated for effectiveness as an adjuvant therapy for women with breast cancer. However, the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene (MORE) trial evaluated the effect of raloxifene on preventing breast cancer. The MORE trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled three-year study of 7705 postmenopausal women who have osteoporosis. In the MORE trial, 13 cases of breast cancer were found among the 5129 women in the raloxifene treatment group versus 27 among the 2576 women who received placebo (RR=O .24) after a median follow-up of 40 months. Like tamoxifen, raloxifene is effective at reducing the incidence of estrogen receptor positive tumors, but not estrogen receptor negative tumors. Additional evidence for a role of estrogens in promoting breast cancer comes from a recent study that showed raloxifene only prevents breast cancer in postmenopausal women that have detectable levels of serum estradiol. [0031] Structure of Estrogens Receptors: The fact that SERMs only work on ER positive tumors indicates that they need to interact with estrogen receptors in order to exert its protective effects on the breast. There are two known estrogen receptors, ERa and ERβ, which are members of the steroid nuclear receptor superfamily. ERa was first cloned in 1986, and surprisingly about 10 years later a second ER was discovered, termed ERβ. ERa contains 595 amino acids, whereas ERβ contains 530 amino acids. \n\n o recep ors are mo u ar pro eins ma e up o ree is inc omains. e amino- erminus oma n (A/B domain) is the least conserved region, exhibiting only a 15% homology between ERa and ERβ. This domain harbors an activation function (AF-I) that can activate gene transcription activation in the absence of estradiol. The central region of ERs contains two zinc finger motifs that bind to an inverted palindromic repeat sequence separated by three nucleotides located in the promoter of target genes. The DNA binding domain (DBD) in ERa and ERβ are virtually identical, exhibiting 95% homology. The carboxy-terminus domain contains the ligand binding domain (LBD), which carries out several essential functions. The LBD contains a region that forms a large hydrophobic pocket where estrogenic compounds bind, as well as regions involved in ER dimerization. The LBD also contains a second activation function (AF-2) that interacts with coregulatory proteins. AF-2 is required for both estrogen activation and repression of gene transcription. The LBDs of ERa and ERβ are only about 55% homologous. The striking differences in the amino acid composition of the ERa and ERβ LBDs may have evolved to create ERs that have distinct transcriptional roles. This would permit ERa and ERβ to regulate the activity of different genes and to elicit different physiological effects. This notion is supported by studies of ERa and ERβ knockout mice. For example, the ERa knockout mice have primitive mammary and uterine development, whereas the ERβ knockout mice develop normal mammary glands and uterus. These observations demonstrate that only ERa is required for the development of these tissues. Furthermore, we have found that ERa is more effective than ERβ at activating genes, whereas ERβ is more effective than ERa at repressing gene transcription. [0032] Mechanisms of action of estrogens: Estrogens can activate or repress gene transcription. There are two characterized pathways for activation of gene transcription, the classical ERE (estrogen response element) pathway and the AP-I pathway. There are at least three essential components necessary for estrogens to regulate the transcription of genes: the ERs (ERa and/or ERβ), the promoter element in target genes and coregulatory proteins. The binding of estradiol to the ER leads to a conformational change, which results in several key steps that initiate transcriptional pathways. First, the interaction of E\n2\n with ER leads to the dissociation of chaperone proteins; this exposes the ER's dimerization surface and DNA binding domain. Loss of the chaperone proteins allows the ERs to dimerize and bind to an ERE in the promoter region of a target gene. [0033] Second, the binding of E\n2\n moves helix 12 of the ER's LED to create a surface that assembles the AF-2 function of the ER. The AF-2 consists of a conserved hydrophobic pocket comprised of helices 3, 5 and 12 of the ER, which together form a binding surface for the pi 60 class of coactivator proteins (coactivators), such as steroid receptor coactivator- 1 (SRC-I) or glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP 1). Coactivators (also known as \"coregulators\") contain several repeat amino acid motifs comprised of LXXLL, which project into hydrophobic cleft surrounded by the AF-2's helices. The coactivators possess histone acetylase activity. It is thought that gene activation occurs after the ERs and coactivator proteins form a complex on the ERE that causes the acetylation of histone proteins bound to DNA. The acetylation of hi stones changes the chromatin structure so that the ER/coregulator complex \n\n can orm a ri ge e ween e an asa ranscrip iona pro eins a are assem e a e ox region of the target gene to initiate gene transcription.\n\n\n[0034] Effect of SERMs on the ERE pathway: Unlike estrogens, SERMs do not activate the ERE pathway. Instead, the SERMs competitively block the effects of estrogens on the ERE pathway. Like estrogens, SERMs bind to ERa and ERβ with high affinity and cause the dissociation of chaperone proteins, ER dimerization and binding of ERs to the ERE. Thus, the antagonist action of SERMs occurs at a step distal to the binding of the ER to the promoter region. The molecular mechanism of the antagonist action of the SERMs has been clarified by the crystallization of the ERa and ERβ LBDs. It is clear from the structure of the ER LBDs that E\n2\n, tamoxifen and raloxifene bind to the same binding pocket. However, tamoxifen and raloxifene contain a bulky side-chain that is absent in E\n2\n. The ER x-ray structures have revealed that the bulky side chain of SERMs obstructs the movement of the LBD, which prevents the formation of a functional AF-2 surface. Remarkably, when a SERM binds to ERa a sequence (LXXML) in helix 12, which is similar to the LXXLL motif, interacts with the hydrophobic cleft of the AF-2 surface to occlude the coactivator recognition site. Thus, unlike estrogens, SERMs do not create a functional AF-2 surface; this prevents the binding of coactivators. Because the coactivator proteins do not bind to the AF-2 surface in the presence of SERMs, the activation pathway is abruptly halted. Instead of recruiting coactivator, ERs liganded with SERMs recruit corepressors, such as N-CoR. [0035] These studies demonstrated that the antagonist properties of SERMs are due to at least three factors. First, SERMs bind to the same binding pocket as estrogens and competitively block their binding to the ERs. Second, SERMs prevent ER from interacting with coactivator proteins that are required for transcriptional activation of the ERE pathway. Third, SERMs recruit corepressors, which prevent transcriptional activation of genes. These actions of SERMs most likely explain how raloxifene and tamoxifen act as antagonists in breast cells to inhibit development of breast cancer. [0036] SERMs are also more effective than E\n2\n at activating genes with an AP-I element. In fact, E\n2\n is an antagonist of SERM-mediated activation of AP-I elements. It has been postulated that SERMs exhibit agonistic actions in tissues, such as the bone and endometrium by activating the AP-I pathway. Interestingly, SERMs are more potent at activating the AP-I pathway in the presence of ERβ, which indicates that SERMs will trigger the AP-I pathway more efficiently in tissues that are rich in ERβ. The role of the AP-I pathway in estrogen-mediated breast carcinogenesis is unclear, because estrogens are much weaker at activating the AP-I pathway compared to SERMs. However, it has been proposed that the AP-I pathway may be involved in resistance to tamoxifen in breast tumors. [0037] In accordance with aspects of the present invention, studies have been performed, which demonstrate that: ERβ is weaker than ERa at activating ERE-tkLuc; ERβ is more effective than ERa at repressing the TNF-RE-tkLuc; and that ERβ inhibits ERα-mediated transcriptional activation of ERE-tkLuc. Detailed experiments are discussed in the Examples section hereinafter.\n\n\n[0038] The invention provides a plant extract composition that contains an extract of the taxonomic species Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family.

Accordingly, in some cells an inventive plant extract possesses estrogenic properties — i.e. contacting a cell comprising an ERE and an ER (ERa, ERβ or both) with an inventive plant extract gives rise to stimulation of a gene under control of the ERE. hi an in vitro cell system, ERE-mediated activation by an inventive estrogenic plant extract leads to expression of a gene that is operatively linked to the ERE. In particular embodiments, estrogenic interaction of an ER \n\n enhanced luciferase expression. Thus, the plant extracts of the present invention may be used to identify ERα+ cell lines, ERβ+ cell lines and/or ERα+/ERβ+ cell lines having an ERE-containing promoter operatively linked to a reporter gene, such as luciferase. Plant extracts of the present invention may also be used as assay reagents, including standards, for identifying compounds having estrogenic effects in ER+ cell lines.\n\n\n[0048] In one such assay method, an inventive plant extract is first prepared at a known activity or concentration. Quantification of the inventive plant extract is conveniently carried out by taring a container, measuring into the container a known volume of the plant extract, reducing the plant extract by evaporation or lyophilization to produce a residue, and obtaining the mass of the container plus plant extract. The difference in mass between the container plus plant extract and the tare mass is the dry mass of the plant extract. The ratio of dry mass of plant extract per volume of plant extract is the concentration per unit volume. The plant extract may be used in its initial form, using the results of the foregoing quantitation method to specify its concentration. The residue can also be reconstituted by addition of water or another suitable solvent system to form a plant extract solution of known concentration.\n\n\n[0049] Once the concentration of plant extract is known, a standard curve is prepared, hi general the ER+ cells are contacted with the plant extract and a signal relating to estrogenic activity is recorded, hi particular, an ER+ cell has a reporter gene under the control of an ERE. This ER+ cell is contacted with a plant extract of the invention, which gives rise to a reporter signal in proportion to the amount of plant extract added. This step may be carried out with multiple samples at the same plant extract concentration, at different plant extract concentrations, or both. As an example, nine samples may be tested: the first three at a first concentration, the next three at a concentration that is a half log greater than the first, and the next three at a concentration a whole log greater than first. The reporter signals are then observed and recorded, and the resulting data points (plant extract concentration versus reporter signal strength) are fitted to a standard curve by a conventional curve-fitting method (e.g. least squares).\n\n\n[0050] To evaluate the estrogenic effect of a candidate compound, a candidate compound is contacted with E+ cells having the reporter gene under control of the ERE. The reporter gene signal is observed and compared to the standard curve to quantitate the candidate compound's relative estrogenic effect. [0051] The ER+ cell line used in the foregoing method may be a cell line that naturally expresses ER, e.g. a human-derived ER+ breast cell carcinoma cell line, hi some embodiments, the ER+ tissue is an immortalized human cell line, e.g. an immortalized bone marrow or breast cell line. Exemplary cell lines include human monocyte, osteoblast, malignant breast carcinoma and immortalized epithelial breast cell lines. Particular cell lines that may be mentioned include U937, U2OS, MDA-MB-435 and MCF-7 cell lines. Other ER+ cell lines, including immortalized cell lines, may also be used. Alternatively, the ER+ cell line may be a cell line that does not naturally express ER, such as a bacterial cell line, that has been transformed with an ER expression vector.\n\n\n[0052] The ER+ cell line is transformed with a vector having a promoter containing an ERE that controls a reporter gene. For example, the vector may be a viral vector containing ERE, a minimal thymidine \n\n . - - u uc s epic e in SEQ DD NO:1, where the ERE is represented by nucleotides 1-, tk is represented by nucleotides nn-, and Luk is represented by nucleotides mm-. The construct is transfected into the target cell by known methods and expression of the ER-ERE-tk-Luk system is confirmed by e.g. performing the foregoing assay on putative ER+ cells in the presence of known quantities of E\n2\n. Other methods of verifying successful transformation of ER+ cells include immunostaining with known ER antibodies. [0053] The ERE-containing promoter is a DNA containing an ERE sequence and a promoter sequence. The promoter sequence is an art-recognized promoter sequence, such as the minimal thymidine kinase (tk) promoter sequence. (See SEQ ID NO: 1 , nucleotides nn-). Other ERE-containing promoters are possible and are within the scope of the instant invention. The ERE and promoter sequence operate together to control expression of the reporter gene. As described herein, the estrogenic compound (plant extract or E\n2\n, for example) binds to the ER, giving rise to ER dimer and forming the AF-2 surface. The ER dimer then binds to the ERE, activating the gene under control of the promoter. In some embodiments, the ERE is directly upstream of (5'- to) the promoter, to which it is directly ligated. As an example, the ERE-tk promoter construct is shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 , nucleotides 1 -nn-1.\n\n\n[0054J The reporter gene is a gene which, when expressed, gives rise to a detectable signal. The luciferase gene is a suitable reporter gene because it gives rise to the protein luciferase, which generates a detectable light signal in the presence of a single reagent, luciferin. In particular, the cDNA of the luciferase gene is expressed to produce the 62 kDa enzymatic protein, luciferase. The luciferase enzyme catalyzes the reaction of luciferin and ATP in the presence OfMg\n2+\n and oxygen to form oxyluciferin,\n\n\nAMP, pyrophosphate (PPi) and emitted light. The emitted light is yellow -green (560 ran), and may easily be detected using a standard photometer. Because ATP, O\n2\n and Mg\n2+\n are already present in cells, this reporter gene only requires addition of the reagent luciferin to produce a detectable signal, and is especially well-suited for use in assays of the present invention. Other reporter genes that may be mentioned as being available in the art include chloramphenicol transacetylase (CAT), neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) and beta-glucuronidase (GUS).\n\n\n[0055] In some assay methods of the invention, it is useful to further characterize the standard plant extract by comparison with one or more estrogenic compounds, SERMs, etc. Such assay methods are performed essentially as described above, making the proper substitutions of standard estrogenic compound and/or SERMs for plant extract in the appropriate parts of the method.\n\n\n[0056] Plant extracts according to the present invention also repress gene expression by the TNF RE-mediated pathway. In some cases, plant extracts of the invention repress gene expression in vitro, especially in cells having a reporter gene (e.g. the luciferase gene, Luc) under control of a TNF RE. In some cases, plant extracts of the invention repress expression of TNF-α, which is a cytokine produced primarily by monocytes and macrophages. This cytokine is found in synovial cells and macrophages in various tissues, and has been strongly implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). TNF-α is also expressed in other inflammatory diseases, and also as a response to endotoxins from bacteria. As repressors of TNF \n\n expression via e represse pa way, p an ex rac s o e inven ion are o in eres in ne treatment of inflammatory disorders associated with elevated levels of TNF.\n\n\n[0057] In some embodiments of the invention, a cell line is prepared, which expresses one or both of ERa and ERβ as well as a reporter gene under control of TNF RE. The TNF RE is generally upstream of (5'- to) the reporter gene, and signal detection is carried out as previously described herein. The sequence of DNA having a reporter gene, in this case luciferase gene, under control of TNF RE is set forth in SEQ ED NO:2. Nucleotides 1 -correspond to the TNF RE, while nucleotides nn- corresponds to the luciferase gene. [0058] The foregoing cell TNF RE-containing cell system further contains one or more copies of an ER gene — i.e. ERa, ERβ or both. The ER+ cell line used in the foregoing method may be a cell line that naturally expresses ER, e.g. a human-derived ER+ breast cell carcinoma cell line, hi some embodiments, the ER+ tissue is an immortalized human cell line, e.g. an immortalized bone marrow or breast cell line. Exemplary cell lines include human monocyte, osteoblast, malignant breast carcinoma and immortalized epithelial breast cell lines. Particular cell lines that may be mentioned include U937, U2OS, MDA-MB-435 and MCF-7 cell lines. Other ER+ cell lines, including immortalized cell lines, may also be used. Alternatively, the ER+ cell line may be a cell line that does not naturally express ER, such as a bacterial cell line, that has been transformed with an ER expression vector.\n\n\n[0059J In the presence of a predetermined amount of luciferin, and in the absence of an estrogenic compound, e.g. E\n2\n or a plant extract of the invention, the cell system emits a yellow light (560 nm) at an intensity, called the \"control intensity\" or the \"baseline intensity\". Light emission at 560 nm is conveniently quantified in optical density units (O.D.\n5\n60nm)- Upon addition of an estrogenic compound, e.g. E\n2\n or one of the inventive plant extracts, the intensity of 560 nm light emissions is attenuated as compared to the control. Remarkably, in the presence of a SERM, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, luciferase expression increases and 560 nm light emission intensity also increases. Thus, plant extracts of the invention are capable of inducing an estrogenic TNF RE-controlled repression of gene expression. [0060] The TNF RE-containing cell system can be used in an assay method according to the invention, hi the inventive assay methods, the attenuation of luciferase activity (i.e. decreased emission of 560 nm light), correlates with increased estrogenic activity, whereas activation of luciferase activity (i.e. increased emission at 560 nm), correlates with anti-estrogenic activity. Standard curves may be prepared using known quantities of the inventive plant extracts, as described herein. Such standard curves may be further augmented by using other known estrogenic or anti-estrogenic standards, such as E\n2\n or some other known estrogenic compound, and/or an anti-estrogenic SERM such as tamoxifen or raloxifene. [0061] Cells from the transformed E+ cell line are then exposed to a candidate compound, the luciferase signal observed, and the signal compared to the previously prepared standard curve(s), as described herein. A compound that causes an increase of luciferase activity as compared to control (baseline), will be characterized as an anti-estrogenic SERM, whereas a compound that causes a decrease in luciferase activity versus control will be classified as estrogenic. The estrogenic or anti-estrogenic effect can then be quantified by comparing the degree of luciferase expression decrease or increase against the decrease \n\n , brought about by E\n2\n, tamoxifen and/or raloxifene.\n\n\n[0062] Plant extract compositions of the present invention also antagonize the interaction OfE\n2\n-ER with ERE. In particular, it has been shown in that extracts of Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family antagonize the activation of ERE-tk-Luc by E\n2\n by directly interacting with ERβ and ERa. As antagonists OfE\n2\n-ER activation of ERE-controlled genes, the inventive plant extract compositions are considered to be similar in effect to tamoxifen, possessing prophylactic, palliative and/or anti-proliferative activity against breast cancer and uterine cancer. [0063] The invention provides in vivo estrogenic methods of using the inventive compositions. In general, in vivo methods comprise administering to a subject an amount of the plant extract sufficient to bring about an estrogenic effect in the subject. The in vivo methods will give rise to estrogenic ERE- controlled gene activation, TNF RE-controlled gene repression (e.g. TNF-α repression), or both. Thus, the in vivo methods will give rise to varied positive phenotypic effects in vivo. [0064] The subject may be a mammal, such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey, chimpanzee, dog, cat or a sheep, and is generally female. The subject may also be human, especially a human female. In some embodiments, the subject is a post-menopausal or post-oophorectomic female, and is in need of estrogenic therapy. In such case, the subject may be suffering from climacteric symptoms, such as hot flashes, insomnia, vaginal dryness, decreased libido, urinary incontinence and depression. In other such cases, the subject may be susceptible to, or suffering from, osteoporosis. Suitable in vivo methods include treatment and/or prevention of medical indications that are responsive to estrogen replacement therapy.\n\n\n[0065] Administration of the compositions according to the present invention will be via a commonly used administrative route so long as one or more of the plant extracts is available to target tissue via that route. Some administrative routes that may be mentioned include: oral, nasal, buccal, rectal, vaginal and/or topical (dermal). Alternatively, administration may be by orthotopic, intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or intravenous injection. Such compositions would normally be administered as pharmaceutically acceptable compositions, described supra.\n\n\n[0066] Treatment (and its grammatical variants — e.g. treat, to treat, treating, treated, etc.) of a disease, disorder, syndrome, condition or symptom includes those steps that a clinician would take to identify a subject to receive such treatment and to administer a composition of the invention to the subject.\n\n\nTreatment thus includes diagnosis of a disease, syndrome, condition or symptom that is likely to be ameliorated, palliated, improved, eliminated, cured by administering the estrogenic plant extract of the invention to the subject. Treatment also includes the concomitant amelioration, palliation, improvement, elimination, or cure of the disease, disorder, syndrome, condition or symptom. In some embodiments, treatment implies prevention or delay of onset of a disease, disorder, syndrome, condition or symptom (i.e. prophylaxis), prevention or delay of progression of a disease, disorder, syndrome, condition or symptom, and/or reduction in severity of a disease, disorder, syndrome, condition or symptom. In the case of neoplastic growth in particular, treatment includes palliation, as well as the reversal, halting or \n\n op as ic g ow . , es r mission, inc u ing comp e an partial remission. In the case of climacteric symptoms, treatment includes prevention and palliation of various symptoms.\n\n\n[0067J Prevention (and its grammatical variants) of a disease, disorder, syndrome, condition or symptom includes identifying a subject at risk to develop the disease, disorder, syndrome, condition or symptom, and administering to that subject an amount of the inventive plant extract sufficient to be likely to obviate or delay the onset of said disease, disorder, syndrome, condition or symptom, hi some cases, prevention includes identifying a post-menopausal woman who the clinician believes, applying a competent standard of medical care, to be in need of hormone replacement therapy, and administering a plant extract of the present invention to the woman, whereby one or more climacteric symptoms is blocked or delayed, hi some embodiments, prevention of osteoporosis includes identifying a post-menopausal woman who the clinician believes, applying a competent standard of medical care, to be at risk for developing osteoporosis, and administering a plant extract of the present invention to the woman, whereby the onset of bone loss is blocked or delayed. [0068] Palliation includes reduction in the severity, number and/or frequency of occurrences of an a disease, disorder, syndrome, condition or symptom. Palliation of climacteric symptoms includes reducing the frequency and/or severity of hot flashes, insomnia, incontinence, depression, etc. [0069] Treatment of osteoporosis includes identifying a person, such as a post-menopausal woman, at risk for bone loss, and administering a plant extract of the present invention to the woman, whereby bone loss is reduced in severity, delayed in onset, or prevented. In some embodiments, treatment of osteoporosis can also include addition of bone mass.\n\n\n[0070] The invention further provides methods of making the inventive extracts of Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family. The invention specifically provides a method of making an inventive estrogenic plant extract. The method includes obtaining a quantity of plant matter from a plant of the species Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family , optionally comminuting the plant matter, contacting said plant matter with an extraction medium, and separating the plant matter from the extraction medium.\n\n\n[0071] hi some embodiments, the plant species are of the plant species Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family are various cultivars of Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family [0072] Plant matter means any part or parts of at least one plant from the species Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family. Plant matter includes the whole plant or any part or parts of the plant, such as the root, bark, wood, leaves, flowers (or flower such as: sepals, petals, stamens, pistils, etc.), fruit, seeds and/or parts or mixtures of any of the foregoing. Plant matter may be fresh cut, dried (including freeze dried), frozen, etc. Plant matter may also be whole or separated into smaller parts. For example, leaves may be chopped, shredded or ground; roots may be chopped or ground; fruit may be chopped, sliced or blended; seeds may be chopped or ground; stems may be shredded, chopped or ground. In particular embodiments of the invention, the plant parts used are the leaves oi Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family \n\n s x rac o a ieum pa ma um of the Polygonaceae family. An \"extract\" is a solution, concentrate or residue that results when a plant part is contacted with an extraction solvent under conditions suitable for one or more compounds from the plant to partition from the plant matter into the extraction solvent; the solution is then optionally reduced to form a concentrate or a residue.\n\n\n[0074] Suitable extraction media for the present invention include water and ethyl alcohol. Specifically, where water is the extraction solvent, purified water is suitable. Purified water includes distilled water, deionized water, water for injection, ultrafiltered water, and other forms purified of water. Ethyl alcohol that is employed in some embodiments of the invention is grain ethanol, and in particular undenatured ethanol (e.g. pure grain ethanol, optionally containing some water, e.g. up to about 10% water). In some embodiments, the extraction solvent is water, ethanol, or a mixture thereof. A concentrate or residue may be prepared by reducing (e.g. evaporating or lyophilizing) the extraction solution. Whether in the original extraction solvent, reduced concentrate, or residue form, each of these preparations is considered an \"extract\" for the purposes of the invention. [0075] A method of producing the plant extract according to the invention optionally comprises first comminuting the plant matter in order to increase its surface area to volume ratio and to concomitantly increase efficiency of the extraction process. Methods of comminuting plant matter include grinding, chopping, blending, shredding, pulverizing, triturating, etc. [0076] The extraction medium (solvent) is then contacted with the plant matter under conditions suitable for causing one or more phytochemicals, in particular estrogenic phytochemicals, to partition from the plant matter into the extraction medium. Such conditions include, in some cases, heating the extraction medium to a temperature above room temperature, agitation, contact time, etc. Exemplary temperatures for extraction are from about 50°C to the boiling point of the extraction solvent. Where water is the extraction solvent, the extraction temperature is generally from room temperature to about 100\n0\nC; temperatures of from about 50°C to about 80\n0\nC are especially suitable, and temperatures of about 75\n0\nC are particularly suitable. In the case of ethanol as an extraction solvent, the extraction temperature is generally from about room temperature to about 78.5°C; temperatures of from about 50\n0\nC to about 78°C are especially suitable and a temperature of about 75°C is particularly suitable. The person of skill in the art will recognize that the proper balance should be drawn between extraction efficiency on the one hand and phytochemical compound stability on the other.\n\n\n[0077] Once the extraction medium and the plant matter are combined, they are optionally agitated to ensure efficient exchange of estrogenic compound from the plant matter into the extraction medium, and are left in contact for a time sufficient to extract a useful amount of phytochemical compound from the plant matter into the extraction medium. After such time has elapsed (e.g. from about 5 min. to about 10 hr., more particularly from about 10 min. to about 5 hr., especially about 30 min. to about 2 hr.), the extraction medium containing the phytochemical compounds is separated from the plant matter. Such separation is accomplished by an art-recognized method, e.g. by filtration, decanting, etc. \n\n composi ion accor ing o e inven ion inc u es an inven ve p an ex rac or a compos on comprising an inventive plant extract of the invention. In such embodiments, the inventive composition will optionally contain one or more additional ingredients. Such additional ingredients may be inert or active. Inert ingredients include solvents, excipients and other carriers. Active ingredients include active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), including those that exhibit synergistic activity in combination with the inventive plant extract. EXAMPLES\n\n\n[0079] The invention may be more fully appreciated with reference to the following illustrative and non- limiting examples. Example 1 :\n\n\n[0080] ERβ is weaker than ERa at activating ERE-tkLuc: The effects ofE\n2\n on transcriptional activation were examined by transfecting a plasmid containing a classical ERE upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase (tk) promoter linked to the luciferase reporter cDNA and an expression vector for ERa or ERβ. E\n2\n produced a 10-fold greater activation of the ERE in the presence of ERa compared to ERβ in human monocytic U937 cells, but the\n\n\n[0081] EC50 values were similar.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n[0082] ERβ is more effective than ERa at repressing the TNF-RE-tkLuc: The effects of effects of E\n2\n on\n\n\nERa and ERβ-mediated transcriptional repression were then compared using the -125 to -82 region of the TNF-α promoter, known as the tumor necrosis factor-response element (TNF-RE). TNF-α produced a 5-10-fold activation of 3 copies of the TNF-RE (-125 to -82) upstream of the tk promoter (TNF-RE tkLuc). E\n2\n repressed TNF-α activation of TNF-RE tkLuc by 60-80% in the presence of ERa and ERβ. However, ERβ was approximately 20 times more effective than ERa at repression (IC\n50\n of 241 pM for ERa versus 15 pM for and ERβ, respectively). It was also found that ERβ is more effective than ERa at repressing the native -1044 to +93 TNF-α promoter. Thus, ERa is much more effective than ERβ at transcriptional activation, whereas ERβ is more effective than ERa at transcriptional repression. In contrast to E\n2\n, the antiestrogens, tamoxifen, raloxifene and ICI 182, 780 produced a 2-fold activation of TNF-RE tkLuc. Furthermore, these antiestrogens abolished the repression induced by E\n2\n. Example 3 : [0083] ERβ inhibits ERα-mediated transcriptional activation of ERE-tkLuc: Surprisingly, when ERa or ERβ were coexpressed in U937 cells, the activation by ERa is markedly inhibited (Figure 1). These data show that ERβ exerts a repressive effect on ERa activation of ERE-tkLuc. Similar results were observed in the breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-435 (Figure 2). Other investigators have found a similar repressive effect of ERβ on ERa transactivation in different cell types. These studies indicate that the different activation of ERa and ERβ on ERE-tkLuc and the repressive effect of ERβ on ERα-mediated- transcription are not cell-type specific and results from intrinsic properties of the ERs. The repression of \n\n a y requires e orma ion o an α p e ero imer, ecause mu a ions m e ix o p that prevent dimerization inhibit its repression activity (data not shown). Example 4:\n\n\n[0084] Materials and Methods: Reagents. Phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 Coon's modification medium was obtained from Sigma. Biobrene was purchased from Applied Biosystems. The U937 cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Human recombinant TNF-α was obtained from R & D Systems.\n\n\n[0085] Plasmid Construction. A Pstl to Ahall. fragment (-1044 to +93) from the human TNF-α gene, pLT, was cloned upstream of the luciferase cDNA. The 5' deletions were constructed by using unique restriction sites, Apal for the -125 deletion, and Styl for the -82 deletion. Three copies of the human\n\n\nTNF-α promoter fragment from -125 to -82 [TNF-responsive element (TNF-RE)] or one copy of the ERE from the frog vitellogenin A2 gene (vitA2-ERE, 5'-TCAGGTCACAGTGACCTGA-S') were ligated upstream of -32 to +45 herpes simplex thymidine kinase (TK) promoter linked to luciferase (TNF-RE tkLuc, and ERE TKLuc, respectively). ERβ mutants were created with QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene), by using oligonucleotides containing the mutation. The mutants were sequenced with Sequenase kits (Amersham Pharmacia) to verify the presence of the mutation. [0086] Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assays - U937 (human monocyte), U20S (human osteosarcoma), MDA-MB-435 (human metastatic breast cancer), and MCF-7 (human breast cancer) cells were obtained from the cell culture facility at the University of California, San Francisco. U937 cells were maintained as described previously, whereas U2OS, MDA-MB-435, and MCF-7 cells were maintained and subcultured in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For experiments, cells were collected, transferred to a cuvette, and then electroporated with a Bio-Rad gene pulser as described previously using 3 μg of reporter plasmid and 1 μg of ERa or ERβ expression vectors. After electroporation, the cells were resuspended in media and plated at 1 ml/dish in 12-well multiplates. The cells were treated with E\n2\n, genistein, daidzein, or biochanin A (Sigma-Aldrich) 3 hr. prior to exposure to 5 ng/ml TNF-α (R & D Systems) for 24 hr. at 37\n0\nC. Cells were solubilized with 200 μL of Ix lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was determined using a commercially available kit (Promega). The concentration of hormone required to produce a half-maximal induction (EC\n50\n) or inhibition (IC\n50\n) of luciferase activity was calculated with the Prism curve-fitting program (Graph Pad Software, version 2.0b). For proliferation studies, parental MCF-7 cells were subcloned at 1 cell/well in the presence of 0.1 nM E\n2\n, and the fastest growing clone was selected for experiments. These cells expressed exclusively ERa as determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The cells were plated in duplicate at a density of 25,000 cells/35-mm plate in tissue culture medium containing 3% stripped fetal bovine serum. One day after plating they were treated with increasing concentrations of E\n2\n or genistein. The medium was changed every other day, and E2 or genistein was added to the medium. After 8 days the cells were counted with a Coulter counter. All experiments \n\n , experiments.\n\n\n[0087] Preparation of Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family of the Liliaceae Family: Samples of Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family were ground to fine powder using a commercial electric herb grinder; 5 grams were weighed and extracted in a) 50 ml of 100% EtOH or b) 50 ml of distilled H\n2\nO was simmered at 75° Celsius for 45 minutes. The extracts (a and b) were than decanted and only the soluble material was used.\n\n\n[0088] Results: Selective estrogen receptor modulating activity in U2OS Bone cells was measured using luciferase assays. U20S osteosarcoma cells were cotransfected with a classic ERE upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase (tk) promoter (ERE-tk-Luc) and expression vectors for human ERa or ERβ Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family activation of ERE-tk-Luc with ERβ, and ERa. ERβ produced a 4.67-fold activation of ERE-tk-Luc with 1 μL/ml Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family and a 4.03 -fold activation of ERE-tk-Luc with 1 μL/ml on ERa. These results indicate that Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family activates ERE-tk-Luc by directly interacting with ERβ. [0089] To investigate the effects of Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family on transcriptional repression, the -125 to -82 region of the TNF-α promoter (TNF-α-responsive element, (TNF-RE)) was used because this region mediates TNF-α activation and E\n2\n repression. E\n2\n produced a profound repression of TNF-α activation of the TNF-RE upstream of a minimal tk promoter (TNF-RE tkLuc) with either transfected ERa or ERβ in U2OS cells. E\n2\n can abolish TNF-α activity on ERβ (100% repression) but not on ERa (73.3% repression). Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family produced a large repression of TNF-α activation of TNF-RE in the presence of ERβ (109.6%) and ERa (102.8%). These results indicate that Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family represses TNF-α activation through TNF RE-tk-Luc by directly interacting with ERβ and ERa. [0090] In these experiments, the lowest dose of Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae family extract that is effective for estrogenic activity is 1.2μg. However, it is to be expected that in other cell systems this number may fluctuate.\n\n\nExample 5: Open Label. Increasing Dose. Dosing Study\n\n\n[0091] In order to assess the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of an extract of Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae Family (Study Drug), the following protocol is carried out. Study Drug comprises 1 mg (week 1), 10 mg (week 2), 100 mg (week 3) or 1000 mg (week 4) of extract of Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae Family in a suitably sized gelatin capsules. (Hereinafter the extract of Rheum palmatum L of the Polygonaceae Family may be referred to as \"Study Drug\"). The dose may be split between two or more gelatin capsules if necessary. Normal, healthy volunteers of age 18 to 60 are administered 1 mg per day of Study Drug for week 1, 10 mg per day of Study Drug for week 2, 100 mg per day of study drug for week 3 and 1000 mg per day of Study Drug for week 4. Subjects are monitored for appearance of any adverse events. At any time, if a subject appears to not tolerate the current dose, the attending medical staff will note such intolerance. The maximum tolerated dose will be considered \n\n , r, su j c xpeπences in o erance,\n\n\n1000 mg of the Study Drug per day.\n\n\nExample 6: Double Blind Efficacy Study\n\n\n[0092] In order to demonstrate efficacy of the Study Drug for the treatment of estrogenic disease states, the following double blind study is performed.\n\n\n[0093] Objective: To determine optimal dose and the safety and efficacy of an ERβ selective Chinese herbal extract (Study Drug) for treatment of hot flushes (also known as hot flashes).\n\n\n[0094] Methods: A multicenter, randomized, blinded, phase II, placebo-controlled trial in 100-300 generally healthy postmenopausal women aged 40-60 years reporting at least 7 moderate to severe hot flushes per day or 50 per week. Women are randomized to 5g (SG5) or 1Og (SGlO) per day of Study\n\n\nDrug or identical placebo (PG) for 12 weeks. Hot flush frequency and severity are recorded in a daily diary.\n\n\n[0095] Results: Participants are characterized by mean age and race. Participants receiving both Study\n\n\nDrug and placebo are also characterized by percent decrease (± S.D., and p value) in hot flush frequency after 12 weeks of treatment. Endometrial thickness is evaluated for each participant and each group\n\n\n(overall, PG, SG5, SGlO). Adverse events are also evaluated for each participant and each group\n\n\n(overall, PG, SG5, SGlO).\n\n\n[0096] Conclusions: Evaluation is based upon the reduction in frequency and severity of hot flushes in healthy postmenopausal women as well as dose titration effects. Methods\n\n\n[0097] Design and Setting: This is a multi-center, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial designed to determine whether the Study Drug is safe and effective in reducing the frequency and severity of hot flushes. The trial is coordinated through an independent third party (Coordinating Center) and participants are recruited at multiple clinical sites. [0098] Participants: Eligible participants are generally healthy postmenopausal women 40 to 60 years old who reported at least 7 moderate to severe hot flushes per day or 50 per week. Women who are excluded: those with a history of breast, uterine or ovarian cancer; melanoma; venous thromboembolism; cardiovascular disease, or severe food or medicine allergies. Also excluded are women reporting active liver or gallbladder disease; abnormal uterine bleeding; pregnancy or lactation, and those with an abnormal mammogram, breast examination, Pap smear or pelvic examination suggestive of cancer.\n\n\nWomen with endometrial thickness exceeding 5 mm measured by transvaginal ultrasound and those using medications known or suspected to affect hot flushes (estrogens, tamoxifen, raloxifene, progestins, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or gabapentin) are also excluded.\n\n\n[0099] At screening, placebo medication and diaries to record hot flushes, bleeding and medication adherence are provided for a 1-week run-in period. Participants who correctly complete their diaries, take at least 80% of the placebo medication, and remain eligible after screening physical, radiological, and laboratory exams are randomized. \n\n y i g oar . [0101] Data Collection: Data are collected, cleaned and analyzed by the Coordinating Center. [0102] Randomization: Randomization is stratified by time since last menstrual period (< 24 months vs. > 24 months) and by clinical site; within strata, treatment is randomly assigned in randomly permuted blocks of 3 to 6 in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio. A research pharmacist at the Coordinating Center receives the study medication from Bionovo, Inc. (Emeryville, CA), applies labels with treatment identification numbers generated by the Coordinating Center statistician, and ships study medication to each clinical site. Study medication is allocated to eligible participants sequentially according to the randomization scheme. [0103] Study Medications and Blinding: Study Drug is a filtered, dried extract of herb as described herein. Carmel coloring and food dyes approved by the US Food and Drug Administration are added to the dry powder to reach a uniform color, and flavorings and sweeteners are added to mask the taste of the herbs. Similar coloring and taste excipients are added to inert solid diluent to produce a placebo powder with the same look, taste and granularity as the active medication. [0104] Participants receive placebo or one of the two doses of Study Drug packaged as a powder and are instructed to dissolve the contents of the packet in at least 3 ounces of non-citrus fluid and drink the beverage twice daily. All investigators, study staff, laboratory personnel and participants are blinded to study medication status.\n\n\n[0105] Measurements: At baseline, participants complete questionnaires regarding demographics, medical, history, medications, quality of life, menopausal symptoms, insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index) and sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index). All participants receive a physical examination, including blood pressure and heart rate, a breast and pelvic exam, and, in women without a hysterectomy, a transvaginal ultrasound to measure endometrial double wall thickness. To evaluate safety, serum hematology, creatinine and urea nitrogen, liver function, and a urine analysis are all performed for each patient. All baseline measures are repeated after 12 weeks of treatment or at the final study visit. [0106] Hot flush frequency and severity are recorded on a diary modeled after a diary widely used in prior studies. The 7-day diary is completed prior to randomization and during weeks 4 and 12 on study medication. For each hot flush, severity is rated as 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe). A hot flush score is calculated by adding the severity rating for each hot flush and dividing by the number of hot flushes. [0107] While on study medication, participants are contacted (by phone or in the clinic) at 2 and 8 weeks, and have a clinic visit at 4 weeks to monitor adherence and adverse events. Medication packets are counted to assess adherence; and adverse events are recorded.\n\n\n[0108] Four weeks after discontinuing study medication, each participant is contacted by phone to ascertain information on adverse events. Self-reported adverse events are classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system. [0109] Diagnostic endometrial biopsies are performed during the study if a participant reports vaginal spotting or bleeding, or if the final endometrial wall thickness measured by transvaginal sonography is over 5 mm or has increased 2 mm or more from baseline. Two blinded pathologists evaluate biopsy \n\n _ _ specimens, i any, in epen en y. e pa o ogis s isagree regar ing is o ogy, anotner tnirα b in e pathologist reviews the slide and makes the final diagnosis.\n\n\n[0110] Statistical Analysis: A sample of 180 participants is estimated to provide 80% power to detect a between-group difference of 20 percentage points in the percent change in hot flush frequency from baseline to 12 weeks.\n\n\n[01 llj All analyses are by intention to treat, according to randomized assignment, without regard to adherence and without imputing or carrying forward missing values. No adjustment is made for multiple testing. Baseline characteristics of the participants are compared using linear or logistic regression or proportional odds models controlling for clinical center and years since menopause. [0112] Primary analyses compare changes from baseline to 4 and 12 weeks in frequency of hot flushes and hot flush score between each of the Study Drug groups (SG5 and SGlO) and placebo (PG). Because the outcomes are right-skewed, repeated-measures log-link Poisson generalized linear models with terms for time (4 or 12 weeks vs. baseline), treatment, and a time-by-treatment interaction, as well as clinical center and years since menopause are used. Primary analyses of secondary outcomes (quality of life, sexual function and insomnia scores) use analogous methods.\n\n\n[0113] In secondary analyses, ANCOVA is used, controlling for site and time since menopause to compare rank transformed percent change in number of hot flushes between the treated and placebo groups. Logistic regression models adjusted for clinical site and years since menopause are used to compare the proportions in each treatment group with a reduction in frequency of hot flushes of 50% or greater from baseline to 12 weeks.\n\n\n[0114] The frequency of adverse events that occurs in more than 2% of any of the treatment groups is compared between treatment groups using chi-square and exact methods when appropriate, stratified by clinical center and years since menopause. [0115] hi pre-specified exploratory analyses, interaction terms are used to determine differences in the treatment effect (percent change in hot flushes at 12 weeks) in subgroups including age (45-50; 50-55; 55- 60 years) ethnicity (white, other), years since menopause (less than 2 years; 2 years or more), bilateral oophorectomy (yes; no), history of estrogen use (yes; no), smoking (current; former or never), current alcohol use (yes, no), body mass index (tertiles), baseline serum estradiol level (5 pg/ml or less; greater than 5 pg/ml), and baseline frequency of hot flushes (tertiles). Results\n\n\n[0116] Results include number of eligible women who are randomized; number of women in each group (PG, SG5, SGlO); number of participants who complete the study overall and in each group and strata; number of participants overall and in each group who took all the assigned medication; number of white and non-white participants overall and in each group; baseline median and mean daily frequency of hot flushes (± S.D., p); median and mean daily hot flush score (± S.D., p); median and mean change in hot flush frequency (± S.D., p) and median and mean hot flush score (± S.D., p) at each evaluation interval. [0117] The effects of treatment with Study Drug on measures of quality of life, sleep quality and sexual function as compared to placebo are also evaluated. \n\n e num er o par icipan s receiving ransvagina u rasoun a ase ine and tne end ol tne s u y is also noted. The number of participants receiving endometrial ultrasound at the end of the trial is also noted. Mean endometrial thickness (+ S.D.) at baseline and at 12 weeks is measured. Where deemed necessary, endometrial biopsy is also performed. The number of participants reporting vaginal bleeding or spotting is also noted; and endometrial biopsy is in as many of these participants as grant consent. The biopsies are evaluated for evidence of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. [0119] Any serious adverse events during the trial are also noted. Discussion [0120] It is considered that treatment with the Study Drug will decrease the frequency and severity of hot flushes in healthy postmenopausal women with moderate to severe symptoms. The results of this study may be used to advance the Study Drug on to further clinical trials, in which the same or higher doses of Study Drug may be tested.\n\n\n[0121J It is also considered that, as the Study Drug is a selective ERβ agonist, adverse events associated with estrogen replacement therapy, such as uterine hyperplasia and cancer, should not be observed for the Study Drug.\n\n\n[0122] While estradiol is an effective treatment for menopausal hot flushes, the currently approved selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS) tamoxifen and raloxifene increase the incidence of menopausal hot flashes. Since neither estradiol nor the SERMs are estrogen receptor subtype selective, it is unclear which estrogen receptor, ERa or ERβ mediates these effects. It has been shown that activation of ERa by estrogen in human breast cancer cells results in proliferation and tumor formation, while activation of ERβ results in growth inhibition and no tumor formation. This study is designed to provide data to demonstrate that hot flushes may be relieved by the Study Drug. This study is further designed to provide preliminary data regarding adverse events that may be associated with the Study Drug. [0123] Conclusion: Treatment with the Study Drug is expected to reduce the frequency and severity of hot flushes in healthy postmenopausal women; and the higher dose of the Study Drug is expected to be more effective than the lower dose. This study is furthermore expected to provide further confirmation that the ERβ pathway may play a role in the treatment of hot flushes.\n\n\n[0124] While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only. Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention.

Description\n\n\n\n\n ERYTHROPOIETIN RECEPTOR PEPTIDE FORMULATIONS AND USES\n\n\nThis application claims priority under 35 U.S. C. § 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/989,758 filed November 21, 2007 and to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/957,396 filed August 22, 2007. The contents of the above-cited applications are incorporated into the present disclosure by reference and in their entireties.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to peptide compounds that are agonists of the erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R). The invention also relates to therapeutic methods using such peptide compounds to treat disorders associated with insufficient or defective red blood cell production. Pharmaceutical compositions, which comprise the peptide compounds of the invention, are also provided.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nErythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone of 165 amino acids, with a molecular weight of about 34 kilodaltons (kD) and preferred glycosylation sites on amino-acid positions 24, 38, 83, and 126. It is initially produced as a precursor protein with a signal peptide of 23 amino acids. EPO can occur in three forms: α, β, and asialo. The α and β forms differ slightly in their carbohydrate components, but have the same potency, biological activity, and molecular weight. The asialo form is an α or β form with the terminal carbohydrate (sialic acid) removed. The DNA sequences encoding EPO have been reported [U.S. Pat. No. 4,703,008 to Lin]. EPO stimulates mitotic division and differentiation of erythrocyte precursor cells, and thus ensures the production of erythrocytes. It is produced in the kidney when hypoxic conditions prevail. During EPO-induced differentiation of erythrocyte precursor cells, globin synthesis is induced; heme complex synthesis is stimulated; and the number of ferritin receptors increases. These changes allow the cell to take on more iron and synthesize functional hemoglobin, which in mature erythrocytes binds oxygen. Thus, erythrocytes and their hemoglobin play a key role in supplying the body with oxygen. These changes are initiated by the interaction of EPO with an appropriate receptor on the cell surface of the erythrocyte precursor cells [See, e.g., Graber and Krantz (1978) Ann. Rev. Med. 29.51- 66]. \n\n EPO is present in very low concentrations in plasma when the body is in a healthy state wherein tissues receive sufficient oxygenation from the existing number of erythrocytes. This normal low concentration is sufficient to stimulate replacement of red blood cells which are lost normally through aging. The amount of EPO in the circulation is increased under conditions of hypoxia when oxygen transport by blood cells in the circulation is reduced. Hypoxia may be caused, for example, by substantial blood loss through hemorrhage, destruction of red blood cells by over-exposure to radiation, reduction in oxygen intake due to high altitude or prolonged unconsciousness, or various forms of anemia. In response to such hypoxic stress, elevated EPO levels increase red blood cell production by stimulating the proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells. When the number of red blood cells in circulation is greater than needed for normal tissue oxygen requirements, EPO levels in circulation are decreased.\n\n\nBecause EPO is essential in the process of red blood cell formation, this hormone has potentially useful applications in both the diagnosis and the treatment of blood disorders characterized by low or defective red blood cell production. Recent studies have provided a basis for the projection of EPO therapy efficacy for a variety of disease states, disorders, and states of hematologic irregularity, including: beta-thalassemia [see, Vedovato, et al. (1984) Acta. Haematol. 71 :211-213]; cystic fibrosis [see, Vichinsky, et al. (1984) J. Pediatric 105:15-21]; pregnancy and menstrual disorders [see, Cotes, et al. (193) Brit. J. Ostet. Gyneacol. 90:304-311]; early anemia of prematurity [see, Haga, et al. (1983) Acta Pediatr. Scand. 72; 827-831]; spinal cord injury [see, Claus-Walker, et al. (1984) Arch. Phys. Med. Rehabil. 65:370-374]; space flight [see, Dunn, et al. (1984) Eur. J. Appl. Physiol. 52:178-182]; acute blood loss [see, Miller, et al. (1982) Brit. J. Haematol. 52:545-590]; aging [see, Udupa, et al. (1984) J. Lab. Clin. Med. 103:574-580 and 581-588 and Lipschitz, et al. (1983) Blood 63:502-509]; various neoplastic disease states accompanied by abnormal erythropoiesis [see, Dainiak, et al. (1983) Cancer 5:1101-1106 and Schwartz, et al. (1983) Otolaryngol. 109:269-272]; and renal insufficiency [see, Eschbach. et al. (1987) N. Eng. J. Med. 316:73-78].\n\n\nPurified, homogeneous EPO has been characterized [U.S. Pat. No. 4,677,195 to Hewick]. A DNA sequence encoding EPO was purified, cloned, and expressed to produce recombinant polypeptides with the same biochemical and immunological properties and natural EPO. A recombinant EPO molecule with oligosaccharides identical to those on natural EPO has also been produced [See, Sasaki, et al. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262: 12059-12076].\n\n\nThe biological effect of EPO appears to be mediated, in part, through interaction with a cell membrane bound receptor. Initial studies, using immature erythroid cells isolated from mouse spleen, suggested that the EPO-binding cell surface proteins comprise two polypeptides having approximate molecular weights of 85,000 Daltons and 100,000 Daltons, respectively [Sawyer, et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:3690-3694]. The number of EPO-binding sites was calculated to average from 800 to 1000 per cell surface. Of these binding sites, approximately 300 bound EPO with a Kj of\n\n\n- ? - \n\n approximately 90 pM (picomolar), while the remaining bound EPO with a reduced affinity of approximately 570 pM [Sawyer, et al. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262:5554-5562]. An independent study suggested that EPO-responsive splenic erythroblasts, prepared from mice injected with the anemic strain (FVA) of the Friend leukemia virus, possess a total of approximately 400 high and low affinity EPO binding sites with K\nd\n values of approximately 100 pM and 800 pM, respectively [Landschulz, et al. (1989) Blood 73:1476-1486].\n\n\nSubsequent work indicated that the two forms of EPO receptor (EPO-R) were encoded by a single gene. This gene has been cloned [See, e.g., Jones, et al. (1990) Blood 76, 31-35; Noguchi, et al. (1991) Blood 78:2548-2556; Maouche, et al. (1991) Blood 78:2557-2563]. For example, the DNA sequences and encoded peptide sequences for murine and human EPO-R proteins are described in PCT Pub. No. WO 90/08822 to D'Andrea, et al. Current models suggest that binding of EPO to EPO- R results in the dimerization and activation of two EPO-R molecules, which results in subsequent steps of signal transduction [See, e.g., Watowich, et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:2140- 2144]. The availability of cloned genes for EPO-R facilitates the search for agonists and antagonists of this important receptor. The availability of the recombinant receptor protein allows the study of receptor-ligand interaction in a variety of random and semi-random peptide diversity generation systems. These systems include the \"peptides on plasmids\" system [described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,270,170]; the \"peptides on phage\" system [described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,018 and Cwirla, et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:6378-6382]; the \"encoded synthetic library\" (ESL) system [described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 946,239, filed Sep. 16, 1992]; and the \"very large scale immobilized polymer synthesis\" system [described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854; PCT Pub. No. 90/15070; Fodor, et al. (1991) Science 251 :767-773; Dower and Fodor (1991) Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 26:271-180; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,186]. Peptides that interact to a least some extent with EPO-R have been identified and are described, for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,773,569; 5,830,851; and 5,986,047 to Wrighton, et al; PCT Pub. No. WO 96/40749 to Wrighton, et al; U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,078 and PCT Pub. No. 96/40772 to Johnson and Zivin; PCT Pub. No. WO 01/38342 to BaIu; and WO 01/91780 to Smith-Swintosky, et al In particular, a group of peptides containing a peptide motif has been identified, members of which bind to EPO-R and stimulate EPO-dependent cell proliferation. Yet, peptides identified to date that contain the motif stimulate EPO-dependent cell proliferation in vitro with EC50 values of about 20 nanomolar (nM) to about 25OnM. Thus, peptide concentrations of 2OnM to 25OnM are required to stimulate 50% of the maximal cell proliferation stimulated by EPO. Still other peptides and constructs thereof that bind to the EPO receptor have been described in U.S. provisional application Serial Nos. 60/470,244, 60/470,245, and 60/469,993, all filed on May 12, 2003; U.S. provisional application Serial Nos. 60/627,432 and 60/627,433 both filed on November 11, 2004; U.S. non- provisional application Serial No. 10/844,968, filed on May 12, 2004; and International Application \n\n Serial Nos. PCT/US2004/14886 and PCT/US2004/014889, both filed on May 12, 2004, and published as WO 2004/101611 and WO 2004/101606, respectively. Each of these applications is hereby incorporated by reference and in its entirety.\n\n\nGiven the immense potential of EPO-R agonists, both for studies of the important biological activities mediated by this receptor and for treatment of disease, there remains a need for the identification of peptide EPO-R agonists of enhanced potency and activity. The present invention provides such compounds.\n\n\nThe citation and/or discussion of cited references in this section and throughout the specification is provided merely to clarify the description of the present invention and is not an admission that any such reference is \"prior art\" to the present invention.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides novel peptide compounds, which are EPO-R agonists of dramatically enhanced potency and activity. These peptide compounds are homodimers of peptide monomers having the amino acid sequence ( AcG)GLY ACHMGPIT(I -nal) VCQPLRK (SEQ ID NO:\n\n\n1), or homodimers of peptide monomers having the amino acid sequence (AcG)GLY ACHMGPIT( 1- nal) VCQPLR(MeG)K (SEQ ID NO: 2), homodimers of peptide monomers having the amino acid sequence (AcG)GLY ACHMGPIT(I -nal) VCQPLR(MeG) (SEQ ID NO: 3); where each amino acid is indicated by standard one letter abbreviation, \"(AcG)\" is N-acetylglycine, \"(1-nal)\" is 1- naphthylalanine, and \"(MeG)\" is N-methylglycine, also known as sarcosine. Each peptide monomer of a peptide dimer contains an intramolecular disulfide bond between the cysteine residues of the monomer.\n\n\nThe peptide monomers may be dimerized by covalent attachment to a branched tertiary amide linker.

The unconventional amino acids in peptides are abbreviated as follows: 1- naphthylalanine is 1-nal or Np; N-methylglycine (also known as sarcosine) is MeG or Sc; and acetylated glycine (N-acetylglycine) is AcG.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"polypeptide\" or \"protein\" refers to a polymer of amino acid monomers that are alpha amino acids joined together through amide bonds. Polypeptides are therefore at least two amino acid residues in length, and are usually longer. Generally, the term \"peptide\" refers to a polypeptide that is only a few amino acid residues in length. The novel EPO-R agonist peptides of the present invention are preferably no more than about 50 amino acid residues in length. They are more preferably of about 17 to about 40 amino acid residues in length. A polypeptide, in contrast with a peptide, may comprise any number of amino acid residues. Hence, the term polypeptide included peptides as well as longer sequences of amino acids. As used herein, the phrase \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" refers to molecular entities and compositions that are \"generally regarded as safe\", e.g., that are physiologically tolerable and do not typically produce an allergic or similar untoward reaction, such as gastric upset, dizziness and the like, when administered to a human. Preferably, as used herein, the term \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term \"carrier\" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the compound is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water or aqueous solution saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions are preferably employed as carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in \"Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\" by E.W. Martin.\n\n\nAs used herein the term \"agonist\" refers to a biologically active ligand which binds to its complementary biologically active receptor and activates the latter either to cause a biological response in the receptor, or to enhance preexisting biological activity of the receptor. \n\n Novel peptides that are EPO-R agonists\n\n\nThe present invention provides novel peptide compounds, which are EPO-R agonists of dramatically enhanced potency and activity. These peptide compounds are homodimers of peptide monomers having the amino acid sequence (AcG)GLY ACHMGPIT(I -nal) VCQPLRK (SEQ ID NO 1), or homodimers of peptide monomers having the amino acid sequence (AcG)GLY ACHMGPIT( 1- nal) VCQPLR(MeG)K (SEQ ID NO 2); where each amino acid is indicated by standard one letter abbreviation, \"(AcG)\" is N-acetylglycine, \"(1-nal)\" is 1 -naphthylalanine, and \"(MeG)\" is \"(MeG)\" is N-methylglycine, also known as sarcosine Each peptide monomer of a peptide dimer contains an intramolecular disulfide bond between the cysteine residues of the monomer Such monomers may be represented schematically as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese monomeric peptides are dimenzed to provide peptide ditners of enhanced EPO-R agonist activity The linker (L\nκ\n) moiety is a branched tertiary amide, which bridges the C-termini of two peptide monomers, by simultaneous attachment to the C-terminal lysine residue of each monomer The tertiary amide linker can be depicted as:\n\n\n-C\n1\nO-CH\n2\n-X-CH\n2\n-C\n2\nO- where- X is NCO-(CH\n2\n^-N\n1\nH-; C\n1\n of the linker forms an amide bond with the ε-amino group of the C-terminal lysine residue of the first peptide monomer, C of the linker forms an amide bond with the ε-amino group of the C-terminal lysine residue of the second peptide monomer; and N\n1\n of X is attached via a carbamate linkage or an amide linkage to an activated polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety, where the PEG has a molecular weight of about 20,000 to about 40,000 Daltons (the term \"about\" indicating that in preparations of PEG, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight).\n\n\nThe tertiary amide linker may also be depicted as:\n\n\n-C\n1\nO-CH\n2\n-X-CH\n2\n-C\n2\nO-\n\n\nwhere\n1\n X is NCO-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-NH-C\n3\nO-, C\n1\n of the linker forms an amide bond with the ε-amino group of the C-terminal lysine residue of the first peptide monomer, and C\n2\n of the linker forms an amide bond with the ε-amino group of the C-terminal lysine residue of the second peptide monomer The peptide dimers of the invention further comprise a spacer moiety of the following structure: \n\n -N\n1\nH-(CHz)\n4\n-C\n4\nH-N\n2\nH-\n\n\nwhere: C\n4\n of the spacer is covalently bonded to C\n3\n of X; N\n1\n of the spacer is covalently attached via a carbamate or an amide linkage to an activated PEG moiety; and N\n2\n of the spacer is covalently attached via a carbamate or an amide linkage to an activated PEG moiety, where PEG has a molecular weight of about 10,000 to about 60,000 Daltons (the term \"about\" indicating that in preparations of PEG, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight).\n\n\nThus, the novel peptides of the invention can also contain a PEG moiety, which is covalently attached via a carbamate linkage or an amide linkage to the tertiary amide linker of the peptide dimer. PEG is a water soluble polymer that is pharmaceutically acceptable. PEG for use in the present invention may be linear, unbranched PEG having a molecular weight of about 20 kilodaltons (20K) to about 6OK (the term \"about\" indicating that in preparations of PEG, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight). Most preferably, the PEG has a molecular weight of about 30K to about 4OK. One skilled in the art will be able to select the desired polymer size based on such considerations as the desired dosage; circulation time; resistance to proteolysis; effects, if any, on biological activity; ease in handling; degree or lack of antigenicity; and other known effects of PEG on a therapeutic peptide.\n\n\nPeptides, peptide dimers and other peptide-based molecules of the invention can be attached to water-soluble polymers (e.g., PEG) using any of a variety of chemistries to link the water-soluble polymer(s) to the receptor-binding portion of the molecule (e.g., peptide + spacer). A typical embodiment employs a single attachment junction for covalent attachment of the water soluble polymer(s) to the receptor-binding portion, however in alternative embodiments multiple attachment junctions may be used, including further variations wherein different species of water-soluble polymer are attached to the receptor-binding portion at distinct attachment junctions, which may include covalent attachment junction(s) to the spacer and/or to one or both peptide chains. In some embodiments, the dimer or higher order multimer will comprise distinct species of peptide chain (i.e., a heterodimer or other heteromultimer). By way of example and not limitation, a dimer may comprise a first peptide chain having a PEG attachment junction and the second peptide chain may either lack a PEG attachment junction or utilize a different linkage chemistry than the first peptide chain and in some variations the spacer may contain or lack a PEG attachment junction and said spacer, if PEGylated, may utilize a linkage chemistry different than that of the first and/or second peptide chains. An alternative embodiment employs a PEG attached to the spacer portion of the receptor- binding portion and a different water-soluble polymer (e.g., a carbohydrate) conjugated to a side chain of one of the amino acids of the peptide portion of the molecule. A wide variety of polyethylene glycol (PEG) species may be used for PEGylation of the receptor-binding portion (peptides + spacer). Substantially any suitable reactive PEG reagent can be used. In preferred embodiments, the reactive PEG reagent will result in formation of a carbamate or \n\n amide bond upon conjugation to the receptor-binding portion. Suitable reactive PEG species include, but are not limited to, those which are available for sale in the Drug Delivery Systems catalog (2003) of NOF Corporation (Yebisu Garden Place Tower, 20-3 Ebisu 4-chome, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo 150- 6019) and the Molecular Engineering catalog (2003) of Nektar Therapeutics (490 Discovery Drive, Huntsville, Alabama 35806). For example and not limitation, the following PEG reagents are often preferred in various embodiments: mPEG2-NHS, mPEG2-ALD, multi-Arm PEG, mPEG(MAL)2, mPEG2(MAL), mPEG-NH2, mPEG-SPA, mPEG-SBA, mPEG-thioesters, mPEG-Double Esters, mPEG-BTC, mPEG-ButyrALD, mPEG-ACET, heterofunctional PEGs (NH2-PEG-COOH, Boc- PEG-NHS, Fmoc-PEG-NHS, NHS-PEG-VS, NHS-PEG-MAL), PEG acrylates (ACRL-PEG-NHS), PEG-phospholipids (e.g., mPEG-DSPE), multiarmed PEGs of the SUNBRITE series including the GL series of glycerine-based PEGs activated by a chemistry chosen by those skilled in the art, any of the SUNBRITE activated PEGs (including but not limited to carboxyl-PEGs, p-NP-PEGs, Tresyl- PEGs, aldehyde PEGs, acetal-PEGs, amino-PEGs, thiol-PEGs, maleimido-PEGs, hydroxyl-PEG- amine, amino-PEG-COOH, hydroxyl-PEG-aldehyde, carboxylic anhydride type-PEG, functionalized PEG-phospholipid, and other similar and/or suitable reactive PEGs as selected by those skilled in the art for their particular application and usage.\n\n\nThe novel peptides of the invention can also contain two PEG moieties that are covalently attached via a carbamate or an amide linkage to a spacer moiety, wherein the spacer moiety is covalently bonded to the tertiary amide linker of the peptide dimer. Each of the two PEG moieties used in such embodiments of the present invention may be linear and may be linked together at a single point of attachment. Each PEG moiety preferably has a molecular weight of about 10 kilodaltons (10K) to about 6OK (the term \"about\" indicating that in preparations of PEG, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight). Linear PEG moieties are particularly preferred. More preferably, each of the two PEG moieties has a molecular weight of about 2OK to about 4OK, and still more preferably between about 2OK and about 4OK. Still more preferably, each of the two PEG moieties has a molecular weight of about 2OK. One skilled in the art will be able to select the desired polymer size based on such considerations as the desired dosage; circulation time; resistance to proteolysis; effects, if any, on biological activity; ease in handling; degree or lack of antigenicity; and other known effects of PEG on a therapeutic peptide.

Soc. 1963 85:2149].\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the peptide monomers of a peptide dimer are synthesized individually and dimerized subsequent to synthesis.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the peptide monomers of a dimer are linked via their C-termini by a branched tertiary amide linker L\nκ\n moiety having two functional groups capable of serving as initiation sites for peptide synthesis and a third functional group (e.g., a carboxyl group or an amino group) that enables binding to another molecular moiety (e.g., as may be present on the surface of a solid support). In this case, the two peptide monomers may be synthesized directly onto two reactive nitrogen groups of the linker L\nκ\n moiety in a variation of the solid phase synthesis technique. Such synthesis may be sequential or simultaneous.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the two peptide monomers may be synthesized directly onto two reactive nitrogen groups of the linker L\nκ\n moiety in a variation of the solid phase synthesis technique. Such synthesis may be sequential or simultaneous. In this embodiment, a lysine linker (L\nκ\n) moiety having two amino groups capable of serving as initiation sites for peptide synthesis and a third functional group (e.g., the carboxyl group of a lysine; or the amino group of a lysine amide, a lysine residue wherein the carboxyl group has been converted to an amide moiety -CONH\n2\n) that enables binding to another molecular moiety (e.g., as may be present on the surface of a solid support) is used.\n\n\nWhere sequential synthesis of the peptide chains of a dimer onto a linker is to be performed, two amine functional groups on the linker molecule are protected with two different orthogonally removable amine protecting groups. The protected linker is coupled to a solid support via the linker's third functional group. The first amine protecting group is removed, and the first peptide of the dimer is synthesized on the first deprotected amine moiety. Then the second amine protecting group is removed, and the second peptide of the dimer is synthesized on the second deprotected amine moiety. For example, the first amino moiety of the linker may be protected with Alloc, and the second with Fmoc. In this case, the Fmoc group (but not the Alloc group) may be removed by treatment with a mild base [e.g., 20% piperidine in dimethyl formamide (DMF)], and the first peptide chain synthesized. Thereafter the Alloc group may be removed with a suitable reagent [e.g., Pd(PPh\n3\n)M- methyl morpholine and chloroform], and the second peptide chain synthesized. Note that where different thiol-protecting groups for cysteine are to be used to control disulfide bond formation (as discussed below) this technique must be used even where the final amino acid sequences of the peptide chains of a dimer are identical. \n\n Where simultaneous synthesis of the peptide chains of a dimer onto a linker is to be performed, two amine functional groups of the linker molecule are protected with the same removable amine protecting group. The protected linker is coupled to a solid support via the linker's third functional group. In this case the two protected functional groups of the linker molecule are simultaneously deprotected, and the two peptide chains simultaneously synthesized on the deprotected amines. Note that using this technique, the sequences of the peptide chains of the dimer will be identical, and the thiol-protecting groups for the cysteine residues are all the same.\n\n\nA preferred method for peptide synthesis is solid phase synthesis. Solid phase peptide synthesis procedures are well-known in the art [see, e.g., Stewart Solid Phase Peptide Syntheses (Freeman and Co.: San Francisco) 1969; 2002/2003 General Catalog from Novabiochem Corp, San Diego, USA; Goodman Synthesis of Peptides and Peptidomimetics (Houben-Weyl, Stuttgart) 2002]. In solid phase synthesis, synthesis is typically commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide using an α-amino protected resin. A suitable starting material can be prepared, for instance, by attaching the required α-amino acid to a chloromethylated resin, a hydroxymethyl resin, a polystyrene resin, a benzhydrylamine resin, or the like. One such chloromethylated resin is sold under the trade name BIO-BEADS SX-I by Bio Rad Laboratories (Richmond, CA). The preparation of the hydroxymethyl resin has been described [Bodonszky, et al. (1966) Chem. Ind. London 38:1597]. The benzhydrylamine (BHA) resin has been described [Pietta and Marshall (1970) Chem. Commun. 650], and the hydrochloride form is commercially available from Beckman Instruments, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). For example, an α-amino protected amino acid may be coupled to a chloromethylated resin with the aid of a cesium bicarbonate catalyst, according to the method described by Gisin (1973) HeIv. Chim. Acta 56:1467.\n\n\nAfter initial coupling, the α-amino protecting group is removed, for example, using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or hydrochloric acid (HCI) solutions in organic solvents at room temperature. Thereafter, α-amino protected amino acids are successively coupled to a growing support-bound peptide chain. The α-amino protecting groups are those known to be useful in the art of stepwise synthesis of peptides, including: acyl-type protecting groups (e.g., formyl, trifluoroacetyl, acetyl), aromatic urethane-type protecting groups [e.g., benzyloxycarboyl (Cbz) and substituted Cbz], aliphatic urethane protecting groups [e.g., t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), isopropyloxycarbonyl, cyclohexyloxycarbonyl], and alkyl type protecting groups (e.g., benzyl, triphenylmethyl), fluorenylmethyl oxycarbonyl (Fmoc), allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc), and l-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6- dioxocyclohex- 1 -ylidene)ethyl (Dde).\n\n\nThe side chain protecting groups (typically ethers, esters, trityl, PMC, and the like) remain intact during coupling and are not split off during the deprotection of the amino-terminus protecting group or during coupling. The side chain protecting group must be removable upon the completion of the synthesis of the final peptide and under reaction conditions that will not alter the target peptide. \n\n The side chain protecting groups for Tyr include tetrahydropyranyl, tert-butyl, trityl, benzyl, Cbz, Z- Br-Cbz, and 2,5-dichlorobenzyl. The side chain protecting groups for Asp include benzyl, 2,6- dichlorobenzyl, methyl, ethyl, and cyclohexyl. The side chain protecting groups for Thr and Ser include acetyl, benzoyl, trityl, tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, 2,6-dichlorobenzyl, and Cbz. The side chain protecting groups for Arg include nitro, Tosyl (Tos), Cbz, adamantyloxycarbonyl mesitoylsulfonyl (Mts), 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofurane-5-sulfonyl (Pbf), 4-mthoxy-2,3,6-trimethyl- benzenesulfonyl (Mtr), or Boc. The side chain protecting groups for Lys include Cbz, 2- chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl (2-Cl-Cbz), 2-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl (2-Br-Cbz), Tos, or Boc.\n\n\nAfter removal of the α-amino protecting group, the remaining protected amino acids are coupled stepwise in the desired order. Each protected amino acid is generally reacted in about a 3- fold excess using an appropriate carboxyl group activator such as 2-(lH-benzotriazol-l-yl)-l, 1,3,3 tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) or dicyclohexylcarbodimide (DCC) in solution, for example, in methylene chloride (CH\n2\nCI\n2\n), N-methyl pyrrolidone, dimethyl formamide (DMF), or mixtures thereof. After the desired amino acid sequence has been completed, the desired peptide is decoupled from the resin support by treatment with a reagent, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or hydrogen fluoride (HF), which not only cleaves the peptide from the resin, but also cleaves all remaining side chain protecting groups. When a chloromethylated resin is used, hydrogen fluoride treatment results in the formation of the free peptide acids. When the benzhydrylamine resin is used, hydrogen fluoride treatment results directly in the free peptide amide. Alternatively, when the chloromethylated resin is employed, the side chain protected peptide can be decoupled by treatment of the peptide resin with ammonia to give the desired side chain protected amide or with an alkylamine to give a side chain protected alkylamide or dialkylamide. Side chain protection is then removed in the usual fashion by treatment with hydrogen fluoride to give the free amides, alkylamides, or dialkylamides. In preparing the esters of the invention, the resins used to prepare the peptide acids are employed, and the side chain protected peptide is cleaved with base and the appropriate alcohol (e.g., methanol). Side chain protecting groups are then removed in the usual fashion by treatment with hydrogen fluoride to obtain the desired ester.\n\n\nThese procedures can also be used to synthesize peptides in which amino acids other than the 20 naturally occurring, genetically encoded amino acids are substituted at one, two, or more positions of any of the compounds of the invention. Synthetic amino acids that can be substituted into the peptides of the present invention include, but are not limited to, N-methyl, L-hydroxypropyl, L-3, 4- dihydroxyphenylalanyl, δ amino acids such as L- δ-hydroxylysyl and D- δ-methylalanyl, L-α- methylalanyl, β amino acids, and isoquinolyl. D-amino acids and non-naturally occurring synthetic amino acids can also be incorporated into the peptides of the present invention. \n\n Peptide modifications\n\n\nOne can also modify the amino and/or carboxy termini of the peptide compounds of the invention to produce other compounds of the invention. For example, the amino terminus may be acetylated with acetic acid or a halogenated derivative thereof such as α-chloroacetic acid, α- bromoacetic acid, or α-iodoacetic acid).\n\n\nOne can replace the naturally occurring side chains of the 20 genetically encoded amino acids (or the stereoisomeric D amino acids) with other side chains, for instance with groups such as alkyl, lower alkyl, cyclic 4-, 5-, 6-, to 7-membered alkyl, amide, amide lower alkyl, amide di(lower alkyl), lower alkoxy, hydroxy, carboxy and the lower ester derivatives thereof, and with 4-, 5-, 6-, to 7- membered heterocyclic. In particular, proline analogues in which the ring size of the proline residue is changed from 5 members to 4, 6, or 7 members can be employed. Cyclic groups can be saturated or unsaturated, and if unsaturated, can be aromatic or non-aromatic. Heterocyclic groups preferably contain one or more nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulfur heteroatoms. Examples of such groups include the furazanyl, furyl, imidazolidinyl, imidazolyl, imidazolinyl, isothiazolyl, isoxazolyl, morpholinyl (e.g. morpholino), oxazolyl, piperazinyl (e.g., 1-piperazinyl), piperidyl (e.g., 1-piperidyl, piperidino), pyranyl, pyrazinyl, pyrazolidinyl, pyrazolinyl, pyrazolyl, pyridazinyl, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrrolidinyl (e.g., 1-pyrrolidinyl), pyrrolinyl, pyrrolyl, thiadiazolyl, thiazolyl, thienyl, thiomorpholinyl (e.g., thiomorpholino), and triazolyl. These heterocyclic groups can be substituted or unsubstituted. Where a group is substituted, the substituent can be alkyl, alkoxy, halogen, oxygen, or substituted or unsubstituted phenyl.\n\n\nOne can also readily modify peptides by phosphorylation, and other methods [e.g., as described in Hruby, et al. (1990) Biochem J. 268:249-262].\n\n\nThe peptide compounds of the invention also serve as structural models for non-peptidic compounds with similar biological activity. Those of skill in the art recognize that a variety of techniques are available for constructing compounds with the same or similar desired biological activity as the lead peptide compound, but with more favorable activity than the lead with respect to solubility, stability, and susceptibility to hydrolysis and proteolysis [See, Morgan and Gainor (1989) Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 24:243-252]. These techniques include replacing the peptide backbone with a backbone composed of phosphonates, amidates, carbamates, sulfonamides, secondary amines, and N- methylamino acids.\n\n\nFormation of disulfide bonds\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention contain two intramolecular disulfide bonds. Such disulfide bonds may be formed by oxidation of the cysteine residues of each peptide monomer. In one embodiment, the control of cysteine bond formation is exercised by choosing an oxidizing agent of the type and concentration effective to optimize formation of the desired isomer. \n\n For example, oxidation of a peptide dimer to form two intramolecular disulfide bonds (one on each peptide chain) is preferentially achieved (over formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds) when the oxidizing agent is DMSO or iodine (I\n2\n).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the formation of cysteine bonds is controlled by the selective use of thiol-protecting groups during peptide synthesis. For example, where a dimer with two intramolecular disulfide bonds is desired, the first monomer peptide chain is synthesized with the two cysteine residues of the core sequence protected with a first thiol protecting group [e.g., trityl(Trt), allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc), and l-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-l-ylidene)ethyl (Dde)or the like], then the second monomer peptide is synthesized the two cysteine residues of the core sequence protected with a second thiol protecting group different from the first thiol protecting group [e.g., acetamidomethyl (Acm), t-butyl (tBu), or the like]. Thereafter, the first thiol protecting groups are removed effecting bisulfide cyclization of the first monomer, and then the second thiol protecting groups are removed effecting bisulfide cyclization of the second monomer.\n\n\nOther embodiments of this invention provide for analogues of these disulfide derivatives in which one of the sulfurs has been replaced by a CH\n2\n group or other isotere for sulfur. These analogues can be prepared from the compounds of the present invention, wherein each peptide monomer contains at least one C or homocysteine residue and an α- amino -γ-butyric acid in place of the second C residue, via an intramolecular or intermolecular displacement, using methods known in the art [See, e.g., Barker, et al. (1992) J. Med. Chem. 35:2040-2048 and Or, et al. (1991) J. Org. Chem. 56:3146-3149]. One of skill in the art will readily appreciate that this displacement can also occur using other homologs of α- amino -γ-butyric acid and homocysteine.\n\n\nIn addition to the foregoing cyclization strategies, other non-disulfide peptide cyclization strategies can be employed. Such alternative cyclization strategies include, for example, amide- cyclization strategies as well as those involving the formation of thio-ether bonds. Thus, the compounds of the present invention can exist in a cyclized form with either an intramolecular amide bond or an intramolecular thio-ether bond. For example, a peptide may be synthesized wherein one cysteine of the core sequence is replaced with lysine and the second cysteine is replaced with glutamic acid. Thereafter a cyclic monomer may be formed through an amide bond between the side chains of these two residues. Alternatively, a peptide may be synthesized wherein one cysteine of the core sequence is replaced with lysine (or serine). A cyclic monomer may then be formed through a thio- ether linkage between the side chains of the lysine (or serine) residue and the second cysteine residue of the core sequence. As such, in addition to disulfide cyclization strategies, amide-cyclization strategies and thio-ether cyclization strategies can both be readily used to cyclize the compounds of the present invention. Alternatively, the amino-terminus of the peptide can be capped with an α- substituted acetic acid, wherein the α-substituent is a leaving group, such as an α-haloacetic acid, for example, α-chloroacetic acid, α-bromoacetic acid, or α-iodoacetic acid. \n\n Addition of branched tertiary amide linker\n\n\nThe peptide monomers may be dimerized by a branched tertiary amide linker moiety. In one embodiment, the linker is incorporated into the peptide during peptide synthesis. For example, where a linker L\nκ\n moiety contains two functional groups capable of serving as initiation sites for peptide synthesis and one or more other functional groups (e.g., a carboxyl group or an amino group) that enables binding to one or more other molecular moieties, the linker may be conjugated to a solid support. Thereafter, two peptide monomers may be synthesized directly onto the two reactive nitrogen groups of the linker L\nκ\n moiety in a variation of the solid phase synthesis technique. In alternate embodiments, the linker may be conjugated to the two peptide monomers of a peptide dimer after peptide synthesis. Such conjugation may be achieved by methods well established in the art. In one embodiment, the linker contains two functional groups suitable for attachment to the target functional groups of the synthesized peptide monomers. For example, a linker containing two carboxyl groups, either preactivated or in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent, may be reacted with the target lysine side chain amine groups of each of two peptide monomers.\n\n\nFor example, the peptide monomers may be chemically coupled to the tertiary amide linker,\n\n\nA^C\n1\nO-CH\n2\n-X-CH\n2\n-C\n2\nO-B* where: X is NCO-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-NH-Y and Y is a suitable protecting group, such as a t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group; A* is a suitable functional group, such as N-oxy succinimide, used to conjugate C\n1\n of the linker to the ε-amino group of the C-terminal lysine residue of the first peptide monomer; and B* is a suitable functional group, such as N-oxy succinimide, used to conjugate C of the linker to the ε-amino group of the C-terminal lysine residue of the second peptide monomer.\n\n\nAdditionally, for example, the peptide monomers may be chemically coupled to the tertiary amide linker, A^C\n1\nO-CH\n2\n-X-CH\n2\n-C\n2\nO-B*\n\n\nwhere: X is NCO-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-NH-C O-; A* is a suitable functional group, such as N-oxy succinimide, used to conjugate C\n1\n of the linker to the ε-amino group of the C-terminal lysine residue of the first peptide monomer; and B* is a suitable functional group, such as N-oxy succinimide, used to conjugate C\n2\n of the linker to the ε-amino group of the C-terminal lysine residue of the second peptide monomer; and the tertiary amide linker is chemically bonded to the spacer moiety,\n\n\nY-NH-(CH\n2\n)\n4\n-C\n4\nH-NH-Y where: C\n3\n of X is covalently bonded to C\n4\n of the spacer; and Y is a suitable protecting group, such as a t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group.\n\n\nAddition of lysine linker \n\n The peptide monomers may be dimerized by a lysine linker L\nκ\n moiety. In one embodiment, the lysine linker in incorporated into the peptide during peptide synthesis. For example, where a lysine linker L\nκ\n moiety contains two functional groups capable of serving as initiation sites for peptide synthesis and a third functional group (e.g., a carboxyl group or an amino group) that enables binding to another molecular moiety, the linker may be conjugated to a solid support. Thereafter, two peptide monomers may be synthesized directly onto the two reactive nitrogen groups of the lysine linker L\nκ\n moiety in a variation of the solid phase synthesis technique.\n\n\nIn alternate embodiments where a peptide dimer is dimerized by a lysine linker L\nκ\n moiety, said linker may be conjugated to the two peptide monomers of a peptide dimer after peptide synthesis. Such conjugation may be achieved by methods well established in the art. In one embodiment, the linker contains at least two functional groups suitable for attachment to the target functional groups of the synthesized peptide monomers. For example, the lysine's two free amine groups may be reacted with the C-terminal carboxyl groups of each of two peptide monomers.\n\n\nAddition of spacer\n\n\nThe peptide compounds of the invention further comprise a spacer moiety. In one embodiment the spacer may be incorporated into the peptide during peptide synthesis. For example, where a spacer contains a free amino group and a second functional group (e.g., a carboxyl group or an amino group) that enables binding to another molecular moiety, the spacer may be conjugated to the solid support.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a spacer containing two functional groups is first coupled to the solid support via a first functional group. Next the lysine linker L\nκ\n moiety having two functional groups capable of serving as initiation sites for peptide synthesis and a third functional group (e.g., a carboxyl group or an amino group) that enables binding to another molecular moiety is conjugated to the spacer via the spacer's second functional group and the linker's third functional group. Thereafter, two peptide monomers may be synthesized directly onto the two reactive nitrogen groups of the linker L\nκ\n moiety in a variation of the solid phase synthesis technique. For example, a solid support coupled spacer with a free amine group may be reacted with a lysine linker via the linker's free carboxyl group. In alternate embodiments the spacer may be conjugated to the peptide dimer after peptide synthesis. Such conjugation may be achieved by methods well established in the art. In one embodiment, the linker contains at least one functional group suitable for attachment to the target functional group of the synthesized peptide. For example, a spacer with a free amine group may be reacted with a peptide's C-terminal carboxyl group. In another example, a linker with a free carboxyl group may be reacted with the free amine group of a lysine amide.\n\n\nAttachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) \n\n In recent years, water-soluble polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), have been used for the covalent modification of peptides of therapeutic and diagnostic importance. Attachment of such polymers is thought to enhance biological activity, prolong blood circulation time, reduce immunogenicity, increase aqueous solubility, and enhance resistance to protease digestion. For example, covalent attachment of PEG to therapeutic polypeptides such as interleukins [Knauf, et al. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263; 15064; Tsutsumi, et al. (1995) J. Controlled Release 33:447), interferons (Kita, et al. (1990) Drug Des. Delivery 6:157), catalase (Abuchowski, et al. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252:582), superoxide dismutase (Beauchamp, et al. (1983) Anal. Biochem. 131:25), and adenosine deaminase (Chen, et al. (1981) Biochim. Biophy. Acta 660:293), has been reported to extend their half life in vivo, and/or reduce their immunogenicity and antigenicity.\n\n\nThe peptide compounds of the invention may comprise a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety, which is covalently attached to the branched tertiary amide linker or the spacer of the peptide dimer via a carbamate linkage or via an amide linkage. An example of PEG used in the present invention is linear, unbranched PEG having a molecular weight of about 20 kiloDaltons (20K) to about 4OK (the term \"about\" indicating that in preparations of PEG, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight). Preferably, the PEG has a molecular weight of about 30K to about 4OK.\n\n\nAnother example of PEG used in the present invention is linear PEG having a molecular weight of about 1OK to about 6OK (the term \"about\" indicating that in preparations of PEG, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight). Preferably, the PEG has a molecular weight of about 2OK to about 4OK. More preferably, the PEG has a molecular weight of about 2OK.\n\n\nExamples of methods for covalent attachment of PEG (PEGylation) are described below. These illustrative descriptions are not intended to be limiting. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a variety of methods for covalent attachment of a broad range of PEG is well established in the art. As such, peptide compounds to which PEG has been attached by any of a number of attachment methods known in the art are encompassed by the present invention.\n\n\nFor example, PEG may be covalently bound to the linker via a reactive group to which an activated PEG molecule may be bound (e.g., a free amino group or carboxyl group). PEG molecules may be attached to amino groups using methoxylated PEG (\"mPEG\") having different reactive moieties. Such polymers include mPEG-succinimidyl succinate, mPEG-succinimidyl carbonate, mPEG-imidate, mPEG-4-nitrophenyl carbonate, and mPEG-cyanuric chloride. Similarly, PEG molecules may be attached to carboxyl groups using methoxylated PEG with a free amine group (InPEG-NH\n2\n).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the linker or spacer contains a terminal amino group (i.e., positioned at the terminus of the spacer). This terminal amino group may be reacted with a suitably activated PEG molecule, such as mPEG-para-nitrophenylcarbonate (mPEG-NPC), to make a stable covalent carbamate bond. Alternatively, this terminal amino group may be reacted with a suitably activated \n\n PEG molecule, such as an mPEG-succinimidyl butyrate (mPEG-SBA) or mPEG-succinimidyl propionate (mPEG-SPA) containing a reactive N-hydroxl-succinimide (NHS) group, to make a stable covalent carbamate bond. In other embodiments, the linker reactive group contains a carboxyl group capable of being activated to form a covalent bond with an amine-containing PEG molecule under suitable reaction conditions. Suitable PEG molecules include mPEG-NH\n2\n and suitable reaction conditions include carbodiimide-mediated amide formation or the like.\n\n\nEPO-R agonist activity assays: In vitro functional assays In vitro competitive binding assays quantitate the ability of a test peptide to compete with\n\n\nEPO for binding to EPO-R. For example (see, e.g., as described in U.S. Patent 5,773,569), the extracellular domain of the human EPO-R (EPO binding protein, EBP) may be recombinantly produced in E. coli and the recombinant protein coupled to a solid support, such as a microtitre dish or a synthetic bead [e.g., Sulfolink beads from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL)]. Immobilized EBP is then incubated with labeled recombinant EPO, or with labeled recombinant EPO and a test peptide. Serial dilutions of test peptide are employed for such experiments. Assay points with no added test peptide define total EPO binding to EBP. For reactions containing test peptide, the amount of bound EPO is quantitated and expressed as a percentage of the control (total=100%) binding. These values are plotted versus peptide concentration. The IC50 value is defined as the concentration of test peptide which reduces the binding of EPO to EBP by 50% (i.e., 50% inhibition of EPO binding).\n\n\nA different in vitro competitive binding assay measures the light signal generated as a function of the proximity of two beads: an EPO-conjugated bead and an EPO-R-conjugated bead. Bead proximity is generated by the binding of EPO to EPO-R. A test peptide that competes with EPO for binding to EPO-R will prevent this binding, causing a decrease in light emission. The concentration of test peptide that results in a 50% decrease in light emission is defined as the IC50 value.\n\n\nThe peptides of the present invention compete very efficiently with EPO for binding to the EPO-R. This enhanced function is represented by their ability to inhibit the binding of EPO at substantially lower concentrations of peptide (i.e., they have very low IC50 values). The biological activity and potency of monomeric and dimeric peptide EPO-R agonists of the invention, which bind specifically to the EPO-receptor, may be measured using in vitro cell-based functional assays.\n\n\nOne assay is based upon a murine pre-B-cell line expressing human EPO-R and further transfected with a fos promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene construct. Upon exposure to EPO or another EPO-R agonist, such cells respond by synthesizing luciferase. Luciferase causes the emission of light upon addition of its substrate luciferin. Thus, the level of EPO-R activation in such cells may be quantitated via measurement of luciferase activity. The activity of a test peptide is measured by \n\n adding serial dilutions of the test peptide to the cells, which are then incubated for 4 hours. After incubation, luciferin substrate is added to the cells, and light emission is measured. The concentration of test peptide that results in a half-maximal emission of light is recorded as the EC50.\n\n\nThe peptides of the present invention show dramatically enhanced ability to promote EPO-R signaling-dependent luciferase expression in this assay. This enhanced function is represented by their ability to yield half of the maximal luciferase activity at substantially lower concentrations of peptide (i.e., they have very low EC50 values). This assay is a preferred method for estimating the potency and activity of an EPO-R agonist peptide of the invention.\n\n\nAnother assay may be performed using FDC-P1/ER cells [Dexter, et al. (1980) J. Exp. Med. 152: 1036-1047], a well characterized nontransformed murine bone marrow derived cell line into which EPO-R has been stably transfected. These cells exhibit EPO-dependent proliferation.\n\n\nIn one such assay, the cells are grown to half stationary density in the presence of the necessary growth factors (see, e.g., as described in U.S. Patent 5,773,569). The cells are then washed in PBS and starved for 16-24 hours in whole media without the growth factors. After determining the viability of the cells (e.g., by trypan blue staining), stock solutions (in whole media without the growth factors) are made to give about 10\n5\n cells per 50μL. Serial dilutions of the peptide EPO-R agonist compounds (typically the free, solution phase peptide as opposed to a phage -bound or other bound or immobilized peptide) to be tested are made in 96-well tissue culture plates for a final volume of 50μL per well. Cells (50μL) are added to each well and the cells are incubated 24-48 hours, at which point the negative controls should die or be quiescent. Cell proliferation is then measured by techniques known in the art, such as an MTT assay which measures H\n3\n-thymidine incorporation as an indication of cell proliferation [see, Mosmann (1983) J. Immunol. Methods 65:55-63]. Peptides are evaluated on both the EPO-R-expressing cell line and a parental non-expressing cell line. The concentration of test peptide necessary to yield one half of the maximal cell proliferation is recorded as the EC50.\n\n\nThe peptides of the present invention show dramatically enhanced ability to promote EPO- dependent cell growth in this assay. This enhanced function is represented by their ability to yield half of the maximal cell proliferation stimulation activity at substantially lower concentrations of peptide (i.e., they have very low EC50 values). This assay is a preferred method for estimating the potency and activity of an EPO-R agonist peptide of the invention.\n\n\nIn another assay, the cells are grown to stationary phase in EPO-supplemented medium, collected, and then cultured for an additional 18 hr in medium without EPO. The cells are divided into three groups of equal cell density: one group with no added factor (negative control), a group with EPO (positive control), and an experimental group with the test peptide. The cultured cells are then collected at various time points, fixed, and stained with a DNA-binding fluorescent dye (e.g., propidium iodide or Hoechst dye, both available from Sigma). Fluorescence is then measured, for example, using a FACS Scan Flow cytometer. The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle \n\n may then be determined, for example, using the SOBR model of CeIIFIT software (Becton Dickinson). Cells treated with EPO or an active peptide will show a greater proportion of cells in S phase (as determined by increased fluorescence as an indicator of increased DNA content) relative to the negative control group. Similar assays may be performed using FDCP-I [see, e.g., Dexter et al. (1980) J. Exp. Med.\n\n\n152:1036-1047] or TF-I [Kitamura, et al. (1989) Blood 73:375-380] cell lines. FDCP-I is a growth factor dependent murine multi-potential primitive hematopoietic progenitor cell line that can proliferate, but not differentiate, when supplemented with WEHI-3-conditioned media (a medium that contains IL-3, ATCC number TIB-68). For such experiments, the FDCP-I cell line is transfected with the human or murine EPO-R to produce FDCP- 1-hEPO-R or FDCP- 1-mEPO-R cell lines, respectively, that can proliferate, but not differentiate, in the presence of EPO. TF-I, an EPO- dependent cell line, may also be used to measure the effects of peptide EPO-R agonists on cellular proliferation.\n\n\nIn yet another assay, the procedure set forth in Krystal (1983) Exp. Hematol 11:649-660 for a microassay based on H\n3\n-thymidine incorporation into spleen cells may be employed to ascertain the ability of the compounds of the present invention to serve as EPO agonists. In brief, B6C3Fi mice are injected daily for two days with phenylhydrazine (60 mg/kg). On the third day, spleen cells are removed and their ability to proliferate over a 24 hour period ascertained using an MTT assay.\n\n\nThe binding of EPO to EPO-R in an erythropoietin-responsive cell line induces tyrosine phosphorylation of both the receptor and numerous intracellular proteins, including She, vav and JAK2 kinase. Therefore, another in vitro assay measures the ability of peptides of the invention to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of EPO-R and downstream intracellular signal transducer proteins. Active peptides, as identified by binding and proliferation assays described above, elicit a phosphorylation pattern nearly identical to that of EPO in erythropoietin-responsive cells. For this assay, FDC-P1/ER cells [Dexter, et al. (1980) J Exp Med 152:1036-47] are maintained in EPO- supplemented medium and grown to stationary phase. These cells are then cultured in medium without EPO for 24 hr. A defined number of such cells is then incubated with a test peptide for approximately 10 min at 37°C. A control sample of cells with EPO is also run with each assay. The treated cells are then collected by centrifugation, resuspended in SDS lysis buffer, and subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The electrophoresed proteins in the gel are transferred to nitrocellulose, and the phosphotyrosine containing proteins on the blot visualized by standard immunological techniques. For example, the blot may be probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (e.g., mouse anti-phosphotyrosine IgG from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), washed, and then probed with a secondary antibody [e.g., peroxidase labeled goat anti-mouse IgG from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc. (Washington, DC)]. Thereafter, phosphotyrosine-containing proteins may be visualized by standard techniques including colorimetric, chemiluminescent, or fluorescent assays. \n\n For example, a chemiluminescent assay may be performed using the ECL Western Blotting System from Amersham.\n\n\nAnother cell-based in vitro assay that may be used to assess the activity of the peptides of the present invention is a colony assay, using murine bone marrow or human peripheral blood cells. Murine bone marrow may be obtained from the femurs of mice, while a sample of human peripheral blood may be obtained from a healthy donor. In the case of peripheral blood, mononuclear cells are first isolated from the blood, for example, by centrifugation through a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient [Stem Cell Technologies, Inc. (Vancouver, Canada)]. For this assay a nucleated cell count is performed to establish the number and concentration of nucleated cells in the original sample. A defined number of cells is plated on methyl cellulose as per manufacturer's instructions [Stem Cell Technologies, Inc. (Vancouver, Canada)]. An experimental group is treated with a test peptide, a positive control group is treated with EPO, and a negative control group receives no treatment. The number of growing colonies for each group is then scored after defined periods of incubation, generally 10 days and 18 days. An active peptide will promote colony formation. Other in vitro biological assays that can be used to demonstrate the activity of the compounds of the present invention are disclosed in Greenberger, et al. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:2931-2935 (EPO-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell line); Quelle and Wojchowski (1991) J. Biol.

USA 90:9571-9575 (regulation of G\n1\n transition by cycling D2 and D3).\n\n\nAn instrument designed by Molecular Devices Corp., known as a microphysiometer, has been reported to be successfully used for measurement of the effect of agonists and antagonists on various receptors. The basis for this apparatus is the measurement of the alterations in the acidification rate of the extracellular media in response to receptor activation.\n\n\nIn vivo functional assays\n\n\nOne in vivo functional assay that may be used to assess the potency of a test peptide is the polycythemic exhypoxic mouse bioassay. For this assay, mice are subjected to an alternating conditioning cycle for several days. In this cycle, the mice alternate between periods of hypobaric conditions and ambient pressure conditions. Thereafter, the mice are maintained at ambient pressure \n\n for 2-3 days prior to administration of test samples. Test peptide samples, or EPO standard in the case positive control mice, are injected subcutaneously into the conditioned mice. Radiolabeled iron (e.g., \n59\nFe) is administered 2 days later, and blood samples taken two days after administration of radiolabeled iron. Hematocrits and radioactivity measurements are then determined for each blood sample by standard techniques. Blood samples from mice injected with active test peptides will show greater radioactivity (due to binding of Fe\n59\n by erythrocyte hemoglobin) than mice that did not receive test peptides or EPO.\n\n\nAnother in vivo functional assay that may be used to assess the potency of a test peptide is the reticulocyte assay. For this assay, normal untreated mice are subcutaneously injected on three consecutive days with either EPO or test peptide. On the third day, the mice are also intraperitoneally injected with iron dextran. At day five, blood samples are collected from the mice. The percent (%) of reticulocytes in the blood is determined by thiazole orange staining and flow cytometer analysis (retic-count program). In addition, hematocrits are manually determined. The percent of corrected reticulocytes is determined using the following formula: % RETICcoRRECTED = % RETICoBSERVED X (Hematocrit^DiviDUAL /\n\n\nHematocrit\nNO\nRMAL)\n\n\nActive test compounds will show an increased % RETIC\nCORRECTED\n level relative to mice that did not receive test peptides or EPO.\n\n\nUse of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention\n\n\nThe peptide compounds of the invention are useful in vitro as tools for understanding the biological role of EPO, including the evaluation of the many factors thought to influence, and be influenced by, the production of EPO and the binding of EPO to the EPO-R (e.g., the mechanism of EPO / EPO-R signal transduction/receptor activation). The present peptides are also useful in the development of other compounds that bind to the EPO-R, because the present compounds provide important structure-activity-relationship information that facilitates that development.\n\n\nMoreover, based on their ability to bind to EPO-R, the peptides of the present invention can be used as reagents for detecting EPO-R on living cells; fixed cells; in biological fluids; in tissue homogenates; in purified, natural biological materials; etc. For example, by labeling such peptides, one can identify cells having EPO-R on their surfaces. In addition, based on their ability to bind EPO-R, the peptides of the present invention can be used in in situ staining, FACS (fluorescence- activated cell sorting) analysis, Western blotting, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), etc. In addition, based on their ability to bind to EPO-R, the peptides of the present invention can be used in receptor purification or in purifying cells expressing EPO-R on the cell surface (or inside permeabilized cells).\n\n\nThe peptides of the invention can also be utilized as commercial reagents for various medical research and diagnostic purposes. Such uses can include but are not limited to: (1) use as a calibration \n\n standard for quantitating the activities of candidate EPO-R agonists in a variety of functional assays;\n\n\n(2) use as blocking reagents in random peptide screening, i.e., in looking for new families of EPO-R peptide ligands, the peptides can be used to block recovery of EPO peptides of the present invention;\n\n\n(3) use in co-crystallization with EPO-R, i.e., crystals of the peptides of the present invention bound to the EPO-R may be formed, enabling determination of receptor/peptide structure by X-ray crystallography; (4) use to measure the capacity of erythrocyte precursor cells induce globin synthesis and heme complex synthesis, and to increase the number of ferritin receptors, by initiating differentiation; (5) use to maintain the proliferation and growth of EPO-dependent cell lines, such as the FDCP-1-mEPO-R and the TF-I cell lines; (6) use related to labeling the peptides of the invention with a radioactive chromophore; and (7) other research and diagnostic applications wherein the EPO- R is preferably activated or such activation is conveniently calibrated against a known quantity of an EPO-R agonist, and the like.\n\n\nIn yet another aspect of the present invention, methods of treatment and manufacture of a medicament are provided. The peptide compounds of the invention may be administered to warm blooded animals, including humans, to simulate the binding of EPO to the EPO-R in vivo. Thus, the present invention encompasses methods for therapeutic treatment of disorders associated with a deficiency of EPO, which methods comprise administering a peptide of the invention in amounts sufficient to stimulate the EPO-R and thus, alleviate the symptoms associated with a deficiency of EPO in vivo. For example, the peptides of this invention will find use in the treatment of renal insufficiency and/or end-stage renal failure/dialysis; chronic kidney disease, anemia associated with AIDS; anemia associated with chronic inflammatory diseases (for example, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic bowel inflammation) and autoimmune disease; and for boosting the red blood count of a patient prior to surgery. Other disease states, disorders, and states of hematologic irregularity that may be treated by administration of the peptides of this invention include: beta-thalassemia; cystic fibrosis; pregnancy and menstrual disorders; early anemia of prematurity; spinal cord injury; space flight; acute blood loss; aging; stroke, ischemia (both CNS and cardiac); and various neoplastic disease states accompanied by abnormal erythropoiesis.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the peptide compounds of the invention may be used for the treatment of disorders which are not characterized by low or deficient red blood cells, for example as a pretreatment prior to transfusions. In addition, administration of the compounds of this invention can result in a decrease in bleeding time and thus, will find use in the administration to patients prior to surgery or for indications wherein bleeding is expected to occur. In addition, the compounds of this invention will find use in the activation of megakaryocytes.\n\n\nSince EPO has been shown to have a mitogenic and chemotactic effect on vascular endothelial cells as well as an effect on central cholinergic neurons [see, e.g., Amagnostou, et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:5978-5982 and Konishi, et al. (1993) Brain Res. 609:29-35], the compounds of this invention will also find use for the treatment of a variety of vascular disorders, \n\n such as: promoting wound healing; promoting growth of collateral coronary blood vessels (such as those that may occur after myocardial infarction); trauma treatment; and post- vascular graft treatment. The compounds of this invention will also find use for the treatment of a variety of neurological disorders, generally characterized by low absolute levels of acetylcholine or low relative levels of acetylcholine as compared to other neuroactive substances e.g., neurotransmitters.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions\n\n\nIn yet another aspect of the present invention, pharmaceutical compositions of the above EPO-R agonist peptide compounds are provided. Conditions alleviated or modulated by the administration of such compositions include those indicated above. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be for administration by oral, parenteral (intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous injection), transdermal (either passively or using iontophoresis or electroporation), transmucosal (nasal, vaginal, rectal, or sublingual) routes of administration or using bioerodible inserts and can be formulated in dosage forms appropriate for each route of administration. In general, comprehended by the invention are pharmaceutical compositions comprising effective amounts of an EPO-R agonist peptide, or derivative products, of the invention together with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, preservatives, solubilizers, emulsifiers, adjuvants and/or carriers. Such compositions include diluents of various buffer content (e.g., Tris-HCl, acetate, phosphate), pH and ionic strength; additives such as detergents and solubilizing agents (e.g., Tween 20, Tween 80, Polysorbate 80), anti-oxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite), preservatives (e.g., Thimersol, benzyl alcohol) and bulking substances (e.g., lactose, mannitol); incorporation of the material into particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, etc. or into liposomes. Hylauronic acid may also be used. Such compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the present proteins and derivatives. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. (1990, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA 18042) pages 1435-1712 which are herein incorporated by reference. The compositions may be prepared in liquid form, or may be in dried powder (e.g., lyophilized) form.\n\n\nOral Delivery\n\n\nContemplated for use herein are oral solid dosage forms, which are described generally in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. 1990 (Mack Publishing Co. Easton PA 18042) at Chapter 89, which is herein incorporated by reference. Solid dosage forms include tablets, capsules, pills, troches or lozenges, cachets, pellets, powders, or granules. Also, liposomal or proteinoid encapsulation may be used to formulate the present compositions (as, for example, proteinoid microspheres reported in U.S. Patent No. 4,925,673). Liposomal encapsulation may be used and the liposomes may be derivatized with various polymers (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,013,556). A description \n\n of possible solid dosage forms for the therapeutic is given by Marshall, K. In: Modern Pharmaceutics Edited by G. S. Banker and CT. Rhodes Chapter 10, 1979, herein incorporated by reference. In general, the formulation will include the EPO-R agonist peptides (or chemically modified forms thereof) and inert ingredients which allow for protection against the stomach environment, and release of the biologically active material in the intestine.\n\n\nAlso contemplated for use herein are liquid dosage forms for oral administration, including pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, and syrups, which may contain other components including inert diluents; adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents; and sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. The peptides may be chemically modified so that oral delivery of the derivative is efficacious.\n\n\nGenerally, the chemical modification contemplated is the attachment of at least one moiety to the component molecule itself, where said moiety permits (a) inhibition of proteolysis; and (b) uptake into the blood stream from the stomach or intestine. Also desired is the increase in overall stability of the component or components and increase in circulation time in the body. As discussed above, PEGylation is a preferred chemical modification for pharmaceutical usage. Other moieties that may be used include: propylene glycol, copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyproline, poly- 1,3- dioxolane and poly-l,3,6-tioxocane [see, e.g., Abuchowski and Davis (1981) \"Soluble Polymer- Enzyme Adducts,\" in Enzymes as Drugs. Hocenberg and Roberts, eds. (Wiley-Interscience: New York, NY) pp. 367-383; and Newmark, et al. (1982) J. Appl. Biochem. 4:185-189].\n\n\nFor oral formulations, the location of release may be the stomach, the small intestine (the duodenum, the jejunem, or the ileum), or the large intestine. One skilled in the art has available formulations which will not dissolve in the stomach, yet will release the material in the duodenum or elsewhere in the intestine. Preferably, the release will avoid the deleterious effects of the stomach environment, either by protection of the peptide (or derivative) or by release of the peptide (or derivative) beyond the stomach environment, such as in the intestine.\n\n\nTo ensure full gastric resistance a coating impermeable to at least pH 5.0 is essential. Examples of the more common inert ingredients that are used as enteric coatings are cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP), HPMCP 50, HPMCP 55, polyvinyl acetate phthalate (PVAP), Eudragit L30D, Aquateric, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), Eudragit L, Eudragit S, and Shellac. These coatings may be used as mixed films.\n\n\nA coating or mixture of coatings can also be used on tablets, which are not intended for protection against the stomach. This can include sugar coatings, or coatings which make the tablet easier to swallow. Capsules may consist of a hard shell (such as gelatin) for delivery of dry therapeutic (i.e. powder), for liquid forms a soft gelatin shell may be used. The shell material of cachets could be thick starch or other edible paper. For pills, lozenges, molded tablets or tablet triturates, moist massing techniques can be used. \n\n The peptide (or derivative) can be included in the formulation as fine multiparticulates in the form of granules or pellets of particle size about lmm. The formulation of the material for capsule administration could also be as a powder, lightly compressed plugs, or even as tablets. These therapeutics could be prepared by compression. Colorants and/or flavoring agents may also be included. For example, the peptide (or derivative) may be formulated (such as by liposome or microsphere encapsulation) and then further contained within an edible product, such as a refrigerated beverage containing colorants and flavoring agents.\n\n\nOne may dilute or increase the volume of the peptide (or derivative) with an inert material. These diluents could include carbohydrates, especially mannitol, α-lactose, anhydrous lactose, cellulose, sucrose, modified dextrans and starch. Certain inorganic salts may be also be used as fillers including calcium triphosphate, magnesium carbonate and sodium chloride. Some commercially available diluents are Fast-Flo, Emdex, STA-Rx 1500, Emcompress and Avicell.\n\n\nDisintegrants may be included in the formulation of the therapeutic into a solid dosage form. Materials used as disintegrates include but are not limited to starch, including the commercial disintegrant based on starch, Explotab. Sodium starch glycolate, Amberlite, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ultramylopectin, sodium alginate, gelatin, orange peel, acid carboxymethyl cellulose, natural sponge and bentonite may all be used. The disintegrants may also be insoluble cationic exchange resins. Powdered gums may be used as disintegrants and as binders and can include powdered gums such as agar, Karaya or tragacanth. Alginic acid and its sodium salt are also useful as disintegrants.\n\n\nBinders may be used to hold the peptide (or derivative) agent together to form a hard tablet and include materials from natural products such as acacia, tragacanth, starch and gelatin. Others include methyl cellulose (MC), ethyl cellulose (EC) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) could both be used in alcoholic solutions to granulate the peptide (or derivative).\n\n\nAn antifrictional agent may be included in the formulation of the peptide (or derivative) to prevent sticking during the formulation process. Lubricants may be used as a layer between the peptide (or derivative) and the die wall, and these can include but are not limited to; stearic acid including its magnesium and calcium salts, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), liquid paraffin, vegetable oils and waxes. Soluble lubricants may also be used such as sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate, polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights, Carbowax 4000 and 6000.\n\n\nGlidants that might improve the flow properties of the drug during formulation and to aid rearrangement during compression might be added. The glidants may include starch, talc, pyrogenic silica and hydrated silicoaluminate. \n\n To aid dissolution of the peptide (or derivative) into the aqueous environment a surfactant might be added as a wetting agent. Surfactants may include anionic detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and dioctyl sodium sulfonate. Cationic detergents might be used and could include benzalkonium chloride or benzethomium chloride. The list of potential nonionic detergents that could be included in the formulation as surfactants are lauromacrogol 400, polyoxyl 40 stearate, polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 10, 50 and 60, glycerol monostearate, polysorbate 20, 40, 60, 65 and 80, sucrose fatty acid ester, methyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose. These surfactants could be present in the formulation of the protein or derivative either alone or as a mixture in different ratios. Additives which potentially enhance uptake of the peptide (or derivative) are for instance the fatty acids oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid.\n\n\nControlled release oral formulations may be desirable. The peptide (or derivative) could be incorporated into an inert matrix which permits release by either diffusion or leaching mechanisms, e.g., gums. Slowly degenerating matrices may also be incorporated into the formulation. Some enteric coatings also have a delayed release effect. Another form of a controlled release is by a method based on the Oros therapeutic system (Alza Corp.), i.e. the drug is enclosed in a semipermeable membrane which allows water to enter and push drug out through a single small opening due to osmotic effects.\n\n\nOther coatings may be used for the formulation. These include a variety of sugars which could be applied in a coating pan. The peptide (or derivative) could also be given in a film coated tablet and the materials used in this instance are divided into 2 groups. The first are the nonenteric materials and include methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, methylhydroxy-ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl-methyl cellulose, sodium carboxy-methyl cellulose, providone and the polyethylene glycols. The second group consists of the enteric materials that are commonly esters of phthalic acid.\n\n\nA mix of materials might be used to provide the optimum film coating. Film coating may be carried out in a pan coater or in a fluidized bed or by compression coating.\n\n\nParenteral delivery Preparations according to this invention for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, or emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents or vehicles are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the compositions, or by heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured using sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium, immediately before use. \n\n Rectal or vaginal delivery\n\n\nCompositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which may contain, in addition to the active substance, excipients such as cocoa butter or a suppository wax. Compositions for nasal or sublingual administration are also prepared with standard excipients well known in the art.\n\n\nPulmonary Delivery\n\n\nAlso contemplated herein is pulmonary delivery of the EPO-R agonist peptides (or derivatives thereof). The peptide (or derivative) is delivered to the lungs of a mammal while inhaling and traverses across the lung epithelial lining to the blood stream [see, e.g., Adjei, et al. (1990) Pharmaceutical Research 7:565-569; Adjei, et al. (1990) Int. J. Pharmaceutics 63:135-144 (leuprolide acetate); Braquet, et al. (1989) J. Cardiovascular Pharmacology 13(sup5):143-146 (endothelin-1); Hubbard, et al. (1989) Annals of Internal Medicine, Vol. Ill, pp. 206-212 (αl -antitrypsin); Smith, et al. (1989) J. Clin. Invest. 84:1145-1146 (α-1 -proteinase); Oswein, et al. (1990) \"Aerosolization of Proteins\", Proceedings of Symposium on Respiratory Drug Delivery II Keystone, Colorado (recombinant human growth hormone); Debs, et al. (1988) J. Immunol. 140:3482-3488 (interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor α); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,284,656 to Platz, et al. (granulocyte colony stimulating factor). A method and composition for pulmonary delivery of drugs for systemic effect is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,569 to Wong, et al.\n\n\nContemplated for use in the practice of this invention are a wide range of mechanical devices designed for pulmonary delivery of therapeutic products, including but not limited to nebulizers, metered dose inhalers, and powder inhalers, all of which are familiar to those skilled in the art. Some specific examples of commercially available devices suitable for the practice of this invention are the Ultravent nebulizer (Mallinckrodt Inc., St. Louis, MO); the Acorn II nebulizer (Marquest Medical Products, Englewood, CO); the Ventolin metered dose inhaler (Glaxo Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC); and the Spinhaler powder inhaler (Fisons Corp., Bedford, MA).\n\n\nAll such devices require the use of formulations suitable for the dispensing of peptide (or derivative). Typically, each formulation is specific to the type of device employed and may involve the use of an appropriate propellant material, in addition to the usual diluents, adjuvants and/or carriers useful in therapy. Also, the use of liposomes, microcapsules or microspheres, inclusion complexes, or other types of carriers is contemplated. Chemically modified peptides may also be prepared in different formulations depending on the type of chemical modification or the type of device employed. Formulations suitable for use with a nebulizer, either jet or ultrasonic, will typically comprise peptide (or derivative) dissolved in water at a concentration of about 0.1 to 25 mg of biologically \n\n active protein per mL of solution. The formulation may also include a buffer and a simple sugar (e.g., for protein stabilization and regulation of osmotic pressure). The nebulizer formulation may also contain a surfactant, to reduce or prevent surface induced aggregation of the peptide (or derivative) caused by atomization of the solution in forming the aerosol. Formulations for use with a metered-dose inhaler device will generally comprise a finely divided powder containing the peptide (or derivative) suspended in a propellant with the aid of a surfactant. The propellant may be any conventional material employed for this purpose, such as a chlorofluorocarbon, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon, a hydrofluorocarbon, or a hydrocarbon, including trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethanol, and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, or combinations thereof. Suitable surfactants include sorbitan trioleate and soya lecithin. Oleic acid may also be useful as a surfactant.\n\n\nFormulations for dispensing from a powder inhaler device will comprise a finely divided dry powder containing peptide (or derivative) and may also include a bulking agent, such as lactose, sorbitol, sucrose, or mannitol in amounts which facilitate dispersal of the powder from the device, e.g., 50 to 90% by weight of the formulation. The peptide (or derivative) should most advantageously be prepared in particulate form with an average particle size of less than 10 mm (or microns), most preferably 0.5 to 5 mm, for most effective delivery to the distal lung.\n\n\nNasal Delivery Nasal delivery of the EPO-R agonist peptides (or derivatives) is also contemplated. Nasal delivery allows the passage of the peptide to the blood stream directly after administering the therapeutic product to the nose, without the necessity for deposition of the product in the lung.\n\n\nFormulations for nasal delivery include those with dextran or cyclodextran.\n\n\nOther penetration-enhancers used to facilitate nasal delivery are also contemplated for use with the peptides of the present invention (such as described in International Patent Publication No.\n\n\nWO 2004056314, filed December 17, 2003, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).\n\n\nDosages\n\n\nFor all of the peptide compounds, as further studies are conducted, information will emerge regarding appropriate dosage levels for treatment of various conditions in various patients, and the ordinary skilled worker, considering the therapeutic context, age, and general health of the recipient, will be able to ascertain proper dosing. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, and on the duration of the treatment desired. Generally dosage levels of 0.001 to 10 mg/kg of body weight daily are administered to mammals. Generally, for intravenous injection or infusion, dosage may be lower.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, any one of the peptides of the present invention may be used to treat individuals with renal failure prior to dialysis or during dialysis (pre-dialysis or dialysis patients). The \n\n therapeutic dose range in this embodiment can be 0.025 to 0.2 milligrams (mg) of compound per 1 kilogram (kg) of body weight of the individual (0.025-0.2 mg/kg). More particularly, the dose range of 0.05-0.1 mg/kg would be preferred. Furthermore, a physician may initially use escalating dosages, starting at 0.025 mg/kg, and then titrate the dosage at approximately 0.025 mg/kg increments for each individual being treated based on their individual hemoglobin responses. Thus, the physician may titrate the dosage for each individual until an adequate hemoglobin response is achieved. In the case of individuals who are pre-dialysis or dialysis patients, the adequate hemoglobin response would be to approximately attain normal hemoglobin levels (14-15 g/dL) or another hemoglobin level as determined by the physician. In this embodiment, the pharmacologically active dose (PAD) for each individual pre-dialysis or dialysis patient is expected to be 0.067-0.075 mg/kg. An advantage of this embodiment is expected to be a lower dosing frequency of once every three to four weeks for each individual patient instead of weekly as is the case for other current erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs). Many routes of administration may be used (oral, IV, etc. as described above). A preferred route of administration for dialysis patients would be intravenously. A preferred route of administration for pre-dialysis patients would be subcutaneously. In other certain embodiments, one of the compounds described above may be used to treat individuals with anemia associated with malignancies (oncology patients). The therapeutic dose range in this embodiment is expected to be three to five times the range for pre-dialysis or dialysis patients (i.e., 0.075-0.5 mg/kg or, alternatively, between 0.05-0.5 mg/kg). More particularly, the dose range of 0.2-0.4 mg/kg would be preferred. As above, the physician treating the oncology patients may titrate the dosage, starting at 0.075 mg/kg or, alternatively, at 0.05 mg/kg, and increasing at 0.075 mg/kg or, alternatively, at 0.05 mg/kg increments until an adequate hemoglobin response is attained. The PAD for each individual oncology patient is expected to be approximately 0.25 mg/kg. Again, the advantage of less frequent dosage of every three to four weeks is expected for each individual patient. Furthermore, other advantages for oncology patients is the dosage may be administered prior to chemotherapy (for example, 3-5 days beforehand) or co-administered with chemotherapy to prevent the decline in hemoglobin during the lag phase between reticulocyte stimulation and hemoglobin rise. Many routes of administration may be used (oral, IV, etc. as described above). Subcutaneous administration would be a preferred route of administration for oncology patients.

However, the use of these and other examples anywhere in the specification is illustrative only, and in no way limits the scope and meaning of the invention or of any exemplified form. Likewise, the invention is not limited to any particular preferred embodiments described herein. Indeed, many modifications and variations of the invention may be apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading this specification, and can be made without departing from its spirit and scope. The invention is therefore to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which the claims are entitled.\n\n\nExample 1: Synthesis of EPO-R agonist peptide dimers by solid phase synthesis\n\n\nStep 1 - Synthesis of Cbz-TAP: A solution containing the commercially available diamine (\"TAP\" from Aldrich Chemical Co.) (1Og, 67.47mmol) in anhydrous DCM (100 ml) was cooled to O\n0\nC. A solution of benzyl chloroformate (4.82ml, 33.7mmol) in anhydrous DCM (50ml) was added slowly through a dropping funnel over a period of 6-7 h, maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture at O\n0\nC throughout, then allowed to warm to room temperature (-25\n0\nC). After a further 16h, the DCM was removed under vacuum and the residue partitioned between 3N HCl and ether. The aqueous layers were collected and neutralized with 50% aq. NaOH to pH 8-9 and extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer was dried over anhydrous Na\n2\nSO^ and then concentrated under vacuum to provide the crude mono-Cbz-TAP (5g, about 50% yield). This compound was used for the next reaction without any further purification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2 - Synthesis of Cbz-TAP-Boc: To a vigorously stirred suspension of the Cbz-TAP (5g,\n\n\n17.7mmol) in hexane (25ml) was added BoC\n2\nO (3.86g, 17.7mmol) and stirring continued at RT overnight. The reaction mixture was diluted with DCM (25ml) and washed with 10% aq. citric acid (2X), water (2X) and brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na\n2\nSθ\n4\n and concentrated under vacuum. The crude product (yield 5g) was used directly in the next reaction.\n\n\n \n\n Step 3 - Synthesis of Boc-TAP: The crude product from the previous reaction was dissolved in methanol (25ml) and hydrogenated in presence of 5% Pd on Carbon (5% w/W) under balloon pressure for 16 hrs. The mixture was filtered, washed with methanol and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo to provide the crude H-TAP-Boc product (yield 3.7g). The overall approximate yield of Boc- TAP after Steps 1-3 was 44% (calculated based on the amount of Cbz-Cl used.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4 - Synthesis of TentaGel-Linker: TentaGel bromide (2.5 g, 0.48 mmol/g, from Rapp Polymere, Germany), phenolic linker (5 equivalent, and K\n2\nCO\n3\n (5 equivalent) were heated in 20 mL of DMF to 70\n0\nC for 14h. After cooling to room temperature, the resin was washed (0.1 N HCl, water, ACN, DMF, MeOH) and dried to give an amber-colored resin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5 - Synthesis of TentaGel-linker-TAP(Boc): 2.5 gm of the resin from above and H- TAP-Boc (1.5gm, 5eq.) and glacial AcOH (34 μl, 5 eq.) was taken in a mixture of 1:1 MeOH-THF and shaken overnight. A IM solution of sodium cyanoborohydride (5eq) in THF was added to this and shaken for another 7hrs. The resin was filtered washed (DMF, THF, 0.1 N HCl, water, MeOH) and dried. A small amount of the resin was benzoylated with Bz-Cl and DIEA in DCM and cleaved with 70% TFA-DCM and checked by LCMS and HPLC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6 - Synthesis of TentaGel-linker-TAP-Lys: The resin from above was treated with a activated solution of Fmoc-Lys(Fmoc)-OH (prepared from 5 eq. of amino acid and 5 eq. of HATU dissolved at 0.5 M in DMF, followed by the addition of 10 eq. of DIEA) and allowed to gently shake 14h. The resin was washed (DMF, THF, DCM, MeOH) and dried to yield the protected resin. Residual amine groups were capped by treating the resin with a solution of 10% acetic anhydride, 20% pyridine in DCM for 20 minutes, followed by washing as above. The Fmoc groups are removed \n\n by gently shaking the resin in 30% piperidine in DMF for 20 minutes, followed by washing (DMF, THF, DCM, MeOH) and drying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7 - Synthesis of TentaGel-Linker-TAP-Lys(Peptide) 2: The resin from above was subjected to repeated cycles of Fmoc-amino acid couplings with HBTU/HOBt activation and Fmoc removal with piperidine to build both peptide chains simultaneously. This was conveniently carried out on an ABI 433 automated peptide synthesizer available from Applied Biosystems, Inc. After the final Fmoc removal, the terminal amine groups were acylated with acetic anhydride (10 eq.) and DIEA (20 eq.) in DMF for 20 minutes, followed by washing as above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 8 - Cleavage from resin: The resin from above was suspended in a solution of TFA\n\n\n(82.5%), phenol (5%), ethanedithiol (2.5%), water (5%), and thioanisole (5%) for 3h at room temperature. Alternative cleavage cocktails such as TFA (95%), water (2.5%), and triisopropylsilane (2.5%) can also be used. The TFA solution was cooled to 5 \n0\nC and poured into Et\n2\nO to precipitate the peptide. Filtration and drying under reduced pressure gave the desired peptide. Purification via preparative HPLC with a C18 column afforded the pure peptide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 9 - Oxidation of peptides to form intramolecular disulfide bonds: The peptide dimer was dissolved in 20% DMSO/water (1 mg dry weight peptide/mL) and allowed to stand at room temperature for 36h. The peptide was purified by loading the reaction mixture onto a C 18 HPLC \n\n column (Waters Delta-Pak C18, 15 micron particle size, 300 angstrom pore size, 40 mm x 200 mm length), followed by a linear ACN/water/0.01 % TFA gradient from 5 to 95% ACN over 40 minutes. Lyopholization of the fractions containing the desired peptide affords the product as a fluffy white solid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 10 - PEGylation of the terminal -NH\n2\n group:\n\n\nPEGylation via a carbamate bond: The peptide dimer was mixed with 1.5 eq. (mole basis) of activated PEG species (mPEG-NPC from NOF Corp. Japan) in dry DMF to afford a clear solution. After 5 minutes 4eq of DIEA was added to above solution. The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature 14h, followed by purification with C18 reverse phase HPLC. The structure of PEGylated peptide was confirmed by MALDI mass. The purified peptide was also subjected to purification via cation ion exchange chromatography as outlined below. The below scheme shows mPEG-NPC PEGylation using SEQ ID NO: 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPEGylation via an amide bond: The peptide dimer is mixed with 1.5 eq. (mole basis) of 1 eq. activated PEG species (PEG-SPA-NHS from Shearwater Corp, USA) in dry DMF to afford a clear \n\n solution. After 5 minutes 10eq of DIEA is added to above solution. The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature 2h, followed by purification with C 18 reverse phase HPLC. The structure of PEGylated peptide was confirmed by MALDI mass. The purified peptide was also subjected to purification via cation ion exchange chromatography as outlined below. The below scheme shows PEG-SPA-NHS PEGylation using SEQ ID NO: 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 11 - Ion exchange purification: Several exchange supports were surveyed for their ability to separate the above peptide-PEG conjugate from unreacted (or hydrolyzed) PEG, in addition to their ability to retain the starting dimeric peptides. The ion exchange resin (2-3g) was loaded into a 1 cm column, followed by conversion to the sodium form (0.2 N NaOH loaded onto column until elutant was pH 14, ca. 5 column volumes), and than to the hydrogen form (eluted with either 0.1 N HCl or 0.1 M HOAc until elutant matched load pH, ca. 5 column volumes), followed by washing with 25% ACN/water until pH 6. Either the peptide prior to conjugation or the peptide-PEG conjugate was dissolved in 25% ACN/water (10 mg/mL) and the pH adjusted to <3 with TFA, then loaded on the column. After washing with 2-3 column volumes of 25% ACN/water and collecting 5 mL fractions, the peptide was released from the column by elution with 0.1 M NH\n4\nOAc in 25% ACN/water, again collecting 5 mL fractions. Analysis via HPLC revealed which fractions contained the desired peptide. Analysis with an Evaporative Light-Scattering Detector (ELSD) indicated that when the peptide was retained on the column and was eluted with the NH\n4\nOAc solution (generally between fractions 4 and 10), no non-conjugated PEG was observed as a contaminant. When the peptide eluted in the initial wash buffer (generally the first 2 fractions), no separation of desired PEG-conjugate and excess PEG was observed.\n\n\nThe following columns successfully retained both the peptide and the peptide-PEG conjugate, and successfully purified the peptide-PEG conjugate from the unconjugated peptide: \n\n Table 1: Ion Exchange Resins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Synthesis of EPO-R agonist peptide dimers by fragment condensation\n\n\nStep 1- Synthesis of (Cbz)\n2\n-Lys: Lysine is reacted under standard conditions with a solution of benzyl chloroformate to obtain lysine protected at its two amino groups with a Cbz group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2 - Synthesis of Boc-TAP: Boc-TAP is synthesized as described in Steps 1 through 3 of\n\n\nExample 1.\n\n\nStep 3 - Coupling of (Cbz)rLys and Boc-TAP: (Cbz)\n2\n-Lys and Boc-TAP are coupled under standard coupling conditions to obtain (Cbz)\n2\n-Lys-TAP-Boc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4 - Lys-TAP-Boc: The crude product from the previous reaction is dissolved in methanol (25ml) and hydrogenated in presence of 5% Pd on Carbon (5% w/W) under balloon pressure for 16 hrs. The mixture is filtered, washed with methanol and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo to provide the crude Lys-TAP-Boc product\n\n\n \n\n Step 5 - Synthesis of peptide monomers by fragment condensation: Four peptide fragments of the peptide monomer sequence are synthesized by standard techniques. These partially protected fragments are then subjected to two independent rounds of coupling. In the first round, the N- terminal half of the monomer is formed by coupling two of the peptide fragments, while the C- terminal half of the monomer is formed by coupling the other two of the peptide fragments. In the second round of coupling, the N-terminal and C-terminal halves are coupled to form the fully protected monomer. The monomer is then OBn-deprotected by standard techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6 - Oxidation of peptide monomers to form intramolecular disulfide bonds: The OBn- deprotected condensed peptide monomers (SEQ ID NO: 12) are then oxidized with under iodide to form intramolecular disulfide bonds between the Acm-protected cysteine residues of the monomers. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7 - Coupling of Lys-TAP-Boc to oxidized OBn-deprotected monomers to form a peptide dimer: Lys-TAP-Boc is coupled to a two-fold molar excess of the oxidized OBn-deprotected monomers under standard conditions to form a peptide dimer. The peptide dimer is then deprotected under standard conditions. \n\n\n\n\n13)\n\n\n13) \n\n\n\n\n\nStep 8 - PEGylation of deprotected ditner: The deprotected peptide dimer is then PEGylated as described in Step 10 of Example 1.\n\n\nStep 9 - Ion exchange purification: The PEGylated peptide dimer is then purified as described in Step 11 of Example 1.\n\n\nExample 3: In vitro activity assays\n\n\nThis example describes various in vitro assays that are useful in evaluating the activity and potency of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention. The results for these assays demonstrate that the novel peptides of this invention bind to EPO-R and activate EPO-R signaling. Moreover, the results for these assays show that the novel peptide compositions exhibit a surprising increase in EPO-R binding affinity and biological activity compared to EPO mimetic peptides that have been previously described. \n\n EPO-R agonist peptide dimers are prepared according to the methods provided in Example 1 or Example 2. The potency of these peptide dimers is evaluated using a series of in vitro activity assays, including: a reporter assay, a proliferation assay, a competitive binding assay, and a C/BFU-e assay. These four assays are described in further detail below. The results of these in vitro activity assays are summarized in Table 2.\n\n\n1. Reporter assay\n\n\nThis assay is based upon a on a murine pre-B-cell line derived reporter cell, Baf3/EpoR/GCSFR fos/lux. This reporter cell line expresses a chimeric receptor comprising the extra-cellular portion of the human EPO receptor to the intra-cellular portion of the human GCSF receptor. This cell line is further transfected with a fos promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene construct. Activation of this chimeric receptor through addition of erythropoietic agent results in the expression of the luciferase reporter gene, and therefore the production of light upon addition of the luciferase substrate luciferin. Thus, the level of EPO-R activation in such cells may be quantitated via measurement of luciferase activity.\n\n\nThe Baf3/EpoR/GCSFR fos/lux cells are cultured in DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), 10% WEHI-3 supernatant (the supernatant from a culture of WEHI-3 cells, ATCC # TIB-68), and penicillin/streptomycin. Approximately 18 h before the assay, cells are starved by transferring them to DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1% WEHI-3 supernatant. On the day of assay, cells are washed once with DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant), then 1 X 10\n6\n cells/mL are cultured in the presence of a known concentration of test peptide, or with EPO (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) as a positive control, in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant). Serial dilutions of the test peptide are concurrently tested in this assay. Assay plates are incubated for 4h at 37°C in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere, after which luciferin (Steady-Glo; Promega, Madison, WI) is added to each well. Following a 5-minute incubation, light emission is measured on a Packard Topcount Luminometer (Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, 111.). Light counts are plotted relative to test peptide concentration and analysed using Graph Pad software. The concentration of test peptide that results in a half-maximal emission of light is recorded as the EC50 [See Table 2: Reporter EC50].\n\n\n2. Proliferation assay\n\n\nThis assay is based upon a murine pre-B-cell line, Baf3, transfected to express human EPO-R. Proliferation of the resulting cell line, BaF3/Gal4/Elk/EPOR, is dependent on EPO-R activation. The degree of cell proliferation is quantitated using MTT, where the signal in the MTT assay is proportional to the number of viable cells. \n\n The BaF3/Gal4/Elk/EPOR cells are cultured in spinner flasks in DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and 2% WEHI-3 supernatant (ATCC # TIB-68). Cultured cells are starved overnight, in a spinner flask at a cell density of IxIO\n6\n cells/ml, in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1% WEHI-3 supernatant. The starved cells are then washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS (Gibco), and resuspended to a density of IxIO\n6\n cells/ml in\n\n\nDMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant). 50μL aliquots (-50,000 cells) of the cell suspension are then plated, in triplicate, in 96 well assay plates. 50μL aliquots of dilution series of test EPO mimetic peptides, or 50μL EPO (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) or\n\n\nAranesp™ (darbepoeitin alpha, an ERO-R agonist commercially available from Amgen) in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant I) are added to the 96 well assay plates (final well volume of lOOμL). For example, 12 different dilutions may be tested where the final concentration of test peptide (or control EPO peptide) ranges from 81OpM to 0.0045pM. The plated cells are then incubated for 48h at 37°C. Next, lOμL of MTT (Roche Diagnostics) is added to each culture dish well, and then allowed to incubate for 4h. The reaction is then stopped by adding 10% SDS + 0.01N HCl. The plates are then incubated overnight at 37°C. Absorbance of each well at a wavelength of 595nm is then measured by spectrophotometry. Plots of the absorbance readings versus test peptide concentration are constructed and the EC50 calculated using Graph Pad software.\n\n\nThe concentration of test peptide that results in a half-maximal absorbance is recorded as the EC50\n\n\n[See Table 2: Proliferation EC50].\n\n\n3. Competitive Binding Assay\n\n\nCompetitive binding calculations are made using an assay in which a light signal is generated as a function of the proximity of two beads: a streptavidin donor bead bearing a biotinylated EPO-R- binding peptide tracer and an acceptor bead to which is bound EPO-R. Light is generated by non- radiative energy transfer, during which a singlet oxygen is released from a first bead upon illumination, and contact with the released singlet oxygen causes the second bead to emit light. These bead sets are commercially available (Packard). Bead proximity is generated by the binding of the EPO-R-binding peptide tracer to the EPO-R. A test peptide that competes with the EPO-R-binding peptide tracer for binding to EPO-R will prevent this binding, causing a decrease in light emission. In more detail the method is as follows: Add 4μL of serial dilutions of the test EPO-R agonist peptide, or positive or negative controls, to wells of a 384 well plate. Thereafter, add 2μL / well of receptor/bead cocktail. Receptor bead cocktail consists of: 15μL of 5mg/ml streptavidin donor beads (Packard), 15μL of 5mg/ml monoclonal antibody abl79 (this antibody recognizes the portion of the human placental alkaline phosphatase protein contained in the recombinant EPO-R), protein A-coated acceptor beads (protein A will bind to the abl79 antibody; Packard), 112.5μL of a 1:6.6 dilution of recombinant EPO-R (produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells as a fusion protein to a portion of the human placental alkaline phosphatase protein which contains the abl79 target epitope) and 607.5μL \n\n of Alphaquest buffer (4OmM HEPES, pH 7.4; ImM MgCl\n2\n; 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20). Tap to mix. Add 2μL/well of the biotinylated EPO-R-binding peptide tracer (3OnM final concentration). The peptide tracer, an EPO-R binding peptide (see in the tables \"Reporter EC50 (pM)\"), is made according to the methods described in Example 1, with sequence Biotin- GGLYACHMGPITWVCQPLRG (SEQ ID NO: 4).\n\n\nPeptide Tracer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentrifuge 1 min to mix. Seal plate with Packard Top Seal and wrap in foil. Incubate overnight at room temperature. After 18 hours read light emission using an AlphaQuest reader (Packard). Plot light emission vs. concentration of peptide and analyze with Graph Pad or Excel.\n\n\nThe concentration of test peptide that results in a 50% decrease in light emission, relative to that observed without test peptide, is recorded as the IC50 [See Table 2: AQ IC50].\n\n\n4. C/BFU-e Assay EPO-R signaling stimulates the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells into proliferating red blood cell precursors. This assay measures the ability of test peptides to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of red blood cell precursors from primary human bone marrow pluripotent stem cells.\n\n\nFor this assay, serial dilutions of test peptide are made in IMDM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone). These serial dilutions, or positive control EPO peptide, are then added to methylcellulose to give a final volume of 1.5mL. The methylcellulose and peptide mixture is then vortexed thoroughly. Aliquots (100,000 cells/mL) of human, bone marrow derived CD34+ cells (Poietics/Cambrex) are thawed. The thawed cells are gently added to 0.1 mL of lmg/ml DNAse (Stem Cells) in a 5OmL tube. Next, 40-50 mL IMDM medium is added gently to cells: the medium is added drop by drop along the side of the 5OmL tube for the first 1OmL, and then the remaining volume of medium is slowly dispensed along the side of the tube. The cells are then spun at 900rpm for 20 min, and the media removed carefully by gentle aspiration. The cells are resuspended in ImI of IMDM medium and the cell density per mL is counted on hemacytometer slide (lOμL aliquot of cell suspension on slide, and cell density is the average count X 10,000 cells/ml). The cells are then diluted in IMDM medium to a cell density of 15,000 cells/mL. A lOOμL of diluted cells is then added to each 1.5 mL methyl cellulose plus peptide sample (final cell concentration in assay media is 1000 cells/ mL), and the mixture is vortexed. Allow the bubbles in the mixture to disappear, and then aspirate ImL using blunt-end needle. Add 0.25 mL aspirated mixture from each sample into each of 4 wells of a 24-well plate (Falcon brand). Incubate the plated mixtures at 37\n0\nC \n\n under 5% CO\n2\n in a humid incubator for 14 days. Score for the presence of erythroid colonies using a phase microscope (5X-10X objective, final magnification of 100X). The concentration of test peptide at which the number of formed colonies is 90% of maximum, relative to that observed with the EPO positive control, is recorded as the EC90 [See Table 2: C/BFU-e EC90].\n\n\n5. Radioligand Competitive Binding Assay\n\n\nAn alternative radioligand competition binding assay can also be used to measure IC\n50\n values of peptides in this invention. This assay measures binding of \n125\nI-EPO to EPOr. The assay is preferably performed according to the following exemplary protocol:\n\n\nA. Materials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Determination of appropriate receptor concentration.\n\n\nOne 50 μg vial of lyophilized recombinant EPOr extracellular domain fused to the Fc portion of human IgGl is reconstituted in 1 mL of assay buffer. To determine the correct amount of receptor to use in the assay, 100 μL serial dilutions of this receptor preparation are combined with approximately 20,000 cpm in 200 μL of iodinated recombinant human Erythropoietin (\n125\nI-EPO) in 12 x 75 mm polypropylene test tubes. Tubes are capped and mixed gently at 4 \n0\nC overnight on a LabQuake rotating shaker.\n\n\nThe next day, 50 μL of a 50 % slurry of Protein-G Sepharose is added to each tube. Tubes are then incubated for 2 hours at 4 \n0\nC, mixing gently. The tubes are then centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 RPM (3297 x G) to pellet the protein-G sepharose. The supernatants are carefully removed and discarded. After washing 3 times with 1 mL of 4 \n0\nC assay buffer, the pellets are counted in a Wallac \n\n Wizard gamma counter. Results are then analyzed and the dilution required to reach 50 % of the maximum binding value is calculated.\n\n\nC. ICso Determination for peptide To determine the IC\n50\n of Peptide I, 100 μL serial dilutions of the peptide are combined with\n\n\n100 μL of recombinant erythropoietin receptor (100 pg/tube) in 12 x 75 mm polypropylene test tubes. Then 100 μL of iodinated recombinant human Erythropoietin (\n125\nI-EPO) is added to each tube and the tubes are capped and mixed gently at 4°C overnight.\n\n\nThe next day, bound \n125\nI-EPO is quantitated as described above. The results are analyzed and the IC\n50\n value calculated using Graphpad Prism version 4.0, from GraphPad Software, Inc. (San Diego, CA). The assay is repeated two or more times for each peptide tested, for a total of 3 or more replicate IC\n50\n determinations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4: In vivo activity assays\n\n\nThis example describes various in vivo assays that are useful in evaluating the activity and potency of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention. EPO-R agonist peptide dimers are prepared according to the methods provided in Example 1 or Example 2. The in vivo activity of these peptide monomers and dimers is evaluated using a series assays, including a polycythemic exhypoxic mouse bioassay and a reticulocyte assay. These two assays are described in further detail below.\n\n\n1. Polycythemic Exhypoxic Mouse Bioassay\n\n\nTest peptides are assayed for in vivo activity in the polycythemic exhypoxic mouse bioassay adapted from the method described by Cotes and Bangham (1961), Nature 191: 1065-1067. This assay examines the ability of a test peptide to function as an EPO mimetic: i.e., to activate EPO-R and induce new red blood cell synthesis. Red blood cell synthesis is quantitated based upon incorporation of radiolabeled iron into hemoglobin of the synthesized red blood cells.\n\n\nBDFl mice are allowed to acclimate to ambient conditions for 7-10 days. Body weights are determined for all animals, and low weight animals (<15 grams) are not used. Mice are subjected to successive conditioning cycles in a hypobaric chamber for a total of 14 days. Each 24 hour cycle consists of 18 hr at 0.40+0.02% atmospheric pressure and 6 hr at ambient pressure. After conditioning, the mice are maintained at ambient pressure for an additional 72 hr prior to dosing.\n\n\nTest peptides, or recombinant human EPO standards, are diluted in PBS + 0.1% BSA vehicle (PBS/BSA). Peptide monomer stock solutions are first solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Negative control groups include one group of mice injected with PBS/BSA alone, and one group injected with 1% DMSO. Each dose group contains 10 mice. Mice are injected subcutaneously (scruff of neck) with 0.5 mL of the appropriate sample.\n\n\nForty eight hours following sample injection, the mice are administered an intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 ml of Fe\n59\n (Dupont, NEN), for a dose of approximately 0.75 μCuries/mouse. Mouse body weights are determined 24hr after Fe\n59\n administration, and the mice are sacrificed 48hr after Fe\n59\n administration. Blood is collected from each animal by cardiac puncture and hematocrits are determined (heparin was used as the anticoagulant). Each blood sample (0.2 ml) is analyzed for Fe\n59\n incorporation using a Packard gamma counter. Non-responder mice (i.e., those mice with radioactive incorporation less than the negative control group) are eliminated from the appropriate data set. Mice that have hematocrit values less than 53% of the negative control group are also eliminated.\n\n\nResults are derived from sets of 10 animals for each experimental dose. The average amount of radioactivity incorporated [counts per minute (CPM)] into blood samples from each group is calculated. \n\n 2. Reticulocyte Assay\n\n\nNormal BDFl mice are dosed (0.5 mL, injected subcutaneously) on three consecutive days with either EPO control or test peptide. At day three, mice are also dosed (0.1 mL, injected intraperitoneally) with iron dextran (100 mg/ml). At day five, mice are anesthetized with CO\n2\n and bled by cardiac puncture. The percent (%) reticulocytes for each blood sample is determined by thiazole orange staining and flow cytometer analysis (retic-count program). Hematocrits are manually determined. The corrected percent of reticulocytes is determined using the following formula: % RETICcoRRECTED = % RETICoBSERVED X (HematocritnroiviDUAL / Hematocrit\nNO\nRMAL)\n\n\n3. Hematological Assay\n\n\nNormal CDl mice are dosed with four weekly bolus intravenous injections of either EPO positive control, test peptide, or vehicle. A range of positive control and test peptide doses, expressed as mg/kg, are tested by varying the active compound concentration in the formulation. Volumes injected are 5ml/kg. The vehicle control group is comprised twelve animals, while 8 animals are in each of the remaining dose groups. Daily viability and weekly body weights are recorded.\n\n\nThe dosed mice are mice are fasted and then anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane and terminal blood samples are collected via cardiac or abdominal aorta puncture on Day 1 (for vehicle control mice) and on Days 15 and 29 (4 mice/group/day). The blood is transferred to Vacutainer\n®\n brand tubes. Preferred anticoagulant is ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Blood samples are evaluated for endpoints measuring red blood synthesis and physiology such as hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hgb) and total erythrocyte count (RBC) using automated clinical analyzers well known in the art (e.g., those made by Coulter, Inc.).\n\n\nExample 5: Synthesis of EPO-R agonist peptide homodimers of peptide monomers having the amino acid sequence (AcG)GL YACHMGPIT(l-nal) VCQPLRK (SEQ ID NO: 1)\n\n\nStep 1 - Synthesis of peptide monomers: Peptide monomers are synthesized using standard Fmoc chemistry on an ABI 43 IA peptide synthesizer, using TG-RAM resin (0.18 mmol/g Rapp Polymere, Germany). For the synthesis of peptide monomers with an amidated carboxy terminus, the fully assembled peptide is cleaved from the resin with 82.5% TFA, 5% water, 6.25% anisole, 6.25% ethanedithiol. The deprotected product is filtered from the resin and precipitated with diethyl ether. After thorough drying, the product is purified by C18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with a gradient of acetonitrile/water in 0.1 % trifluoro acetic acid. The structure of the peptide is confirmed by electospray mass spectrometry. The peptide is dissolved in a 1:1 solution of DMSO:water at a concentration of lmg/mL to affect disulfide formation. The product is purified by \n\n C18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with a gradient of acetonitrile/water in 0.1 % trifluoro acetic acid. The peptide monomers may be illustrated as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2 - Synthesis of the trifunctional linker: To a solution of diethyl iminoacetate (10.0g,\n\n\n52.8 mmol) and Boc-beta-alanine (10.0g, 52.8 mmol) in 100 mL of DCM was added diisopropylcarbodiimide (8.0 mL, 51.1 mmol) over 10 minutes at room temperature. The reaction mixture warmed to -10 degrees during the addition, then cooled back to room temperature over 20 minutes. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir overnight and the precipitated diisopropylurea was filtered off. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford a gum, and the residue dissolved in ethyl acetate and again filtered to remove the additional precipitated urea. The organic phase was placed into a separtory funnel, washed (sat. NaHCC>\n3\n, brine, 0.5 N HCl, brine), dried (MgSO\n4\n), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the diester product as a colorless oil. The diester was taken up in a 1: 1 mixture of MeOH:THF (100 mL) and to this was added water (25 mL), and then NaOH (5g, 125 mmol). The pH was measured to be >10. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h, and then acidified to pH 1 with 6N HCl. The aq. Phase was saturated with NaCl and extracted 4 times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phase was washed (brine), dried (MgSO\n4\n), and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a white semi-solid. The solid was dissolved in 50 mL of DCM and to this was added 300 mL hexane to create a white slurry. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford the diacid as a white solid (14.7 g, 91.5% yield for 2 steps). To a solution of the diacid (Ig, 3.29 mmol) in 20 mL of DMF was added N- hydroxysuccinimide (770 mg, 6.69 mmol) and diisopropylcarbodiimide (1.00 mL, 6.38 mmol) and A- dimethylaminopyridine (3 mg, 0.02 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The residue was taken up in ethyl acetate and filtered to remove the precipitated urea. The organic phase was placed into a separtory funnel, washed (sat. NaHCO\n3\n, brine, 0.5 N HCl, brine), dried (MgSO\n4\n), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the di-NHS ester product as a white solid (1.12g, 68% yield).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3 - Coupling of the trifunctional linker to the peptide monomers: For coupling to the linker, 2 eq peptide is mixed with 1 eq of trifunctional linker in dry DMF to give clear solution, 5eq of \n\n DIEA is added after 2 minutes. The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 14h. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the crude product is dissolved in 80% TFA in DCM for 30min to remove the Boc group, followed by purification with C 18 reverse phase HPLC. The structure of the dimer is confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. This coupling reaction attaches the linker to the nitrogen atom of the ε-amino group of the lysine residue of each monomer. The process is shown below with SEQ ID NO: 1. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n PEGylation via a carbamate bond: The peptide dimer is mixed with an equal amount (mole basis) of activated PEG species (mPEG-NPC from NOF Corp. Japan) in dry DMF to afford a clear solution. After 5 minutes 4eq of DIEA is added to above solution. The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature 14h, followed by purification with C18 reverse phase HPLC. The structure of PEGylated peptide is confirmed by MALDI mass. The purified peptide was also subjected to purification via cation ion exchange chromatography as outlined below. The mPEG-NPC PEGylation is shown below using SEQ ID NO: 1.\n\n\n \n\n PEGylation via an amide bond: The peptide dimer is mixed with an equal amount (mole basis) of activated PEG species (PEG-SPA-NHS from Shearwater Corp, USA) in dry DMF to afford a clear solution. After 5 minutes lOeq of DIEA is added to above solution. The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature 2h, followed by purification with C18 reverse phase HPLC. The structure of PEGylated \n\n peptide was confirmed by MALDI mass. The purified peptide was also subjected to purification via cation ion exchange chromatography as outlined below. The PEG-SPA-NHS PEGylation is shown below using SEQ ID NO: 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: - Ion exchange purification of peptides: Several exchange supports were surveyed for their ability to separate the above peptide-PEG conjugate from unreacted (or hydrolyzed) PEG, in addition to their ability to retain the starting dimeric peptides. The ion exchange resin (2-3g) was loaded into a 1 cm column, followed by conversion to the sodium form (0.2 N NaOH loaded onto column until elutant was pH 14, ca. 5 column volumes), and than to the hydrogen form (eluted with either 0.1 N HCl or 0.1 M HOAc until elutant matched load pH, ca. 5 column volumes), followed by washing with 25% ACN/water until pH 6. Either the peptide prior to conjugation or the peptide-PEG conjugate was dissolved in 25% ACN/water (10 mg/mL) and the pH adjusted to <3 with TFA, then \n\n loaded on the column. After washing with 2-3 column volumes of 25% ACN/water and collecting 5 mL fractions, the peptide was released from the column by elution with 0.1 M NH\n4\nOAc in 25% ACN/water, again collecting 5 mL fractions. Analysis via HPLC revealed which fractions contained the desired peptide. Analysis with an Evaporative Light-Scattering Detector (ELSD) indicated that when the peptide was retained on the column and was eluted with the NH\n4\nOAc solution (generally between fractions 4 and 10), no non-conjugated PEG was observed as a contaminant. When the peptide eluted in the initial wash buffer (generally the first 2 fractions), no separation of desired PEG- conjugate and excess PEG was observed.\n\n\nThe following columns successfully retained both the peptide and the peptide-PEG conjugate, and successfully purified the peptide-PEG conjugate from the unconjugated peptide:\n\n\nTable 3: Ion Exchange Resins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6: Synthesis of EPO-R agonist peptide homodimers of peptide monomers having the amino acid sequence (AcG)GL YACHMGPIT(l-nal) VCQPLR(MeG)K (SEQ ID NO: 2)\n\n\nEPO-R agonist peptide homodimers of peptide monomers having the amino acid sequence (AcG)GLY ACHMGPIT(I -nal) VCQPLR(MeG)K (SEQ ID NO: 2) are synthesized as described in Example 1, except that in Step 1 the synthesized peptide monomers are:\n\n\n(AcG)GL Y ACHMGPIT(I -nal) VCQPLR(MeG)K (SEO ID NO 2) Where the PEG is attached to the linker via a carbamate linkage, the final product of this synthesis using SEQ ID NO: 2 may be illustrated structurally as follows:\n\n\n \n\n Where the PEG is attached to the linker via an amide linkage, the final product of this synthesis using SEQ ID NO: 2 may be illustrated structurally as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7: In vitro activity assays\n\n\nThis example describes various in vitro assays that are useful in evaluating the activity and potency of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention. The results for these assays demonstrate that the novel peptides of this invention bind to EPO-R and activate EPO-R signaling. Moreover, the results for these assays show that the novel peptide compositions exhibit a surprising increase in EPO-R binding affinity and biological activity compared to EPO mimetic peptides that have been previously described.\n\n\nEPO-R agonist peptide monomers and dimers are prepared according to the methods provided in Example 1 or Example 2. The potency of these peptide dimers is evaluated using a series of in vitro activity assays, including: a reporter assay, a proliferation assay, a competitive binding assay, and a C/BFU-e assay. These four assays are described in further detail below. The results of these in vitro activity assays are summarized in Table 2. 1. Reporter assay This assay is based upon a murine pre-B-cell lin derived reporter cell, Baf3/EpoR/GCSFR fos/lux. This reporter cell line expresses a chimeric receptor comprising the extra-cellular portion of the human EPO receptor to the intra-cellular portion of the human GCSF receptor. This cell line is further transfected with a fos promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene construct. Activation of this chimeric receptor through addition of erythropoietic agent results in the expression of the luciferase reporter gene, and therefore the production of light upon addition of the luciferase substrate luciferin. Thus, the level of EPO-R activation in such cells may be quantitated via measurement of luciferase activity.\n\n\nThe Baf3/EpoR/GCSFR fos/lux cells are cultured in DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), 10% WEHI-3 supernatant (the supernatant from a culture of WEHI-3 cells, ATCC # TIB-68), and penicillin/streptomycin. \n\n Approximately 18 h before the assay, cells are starved by transferring them to DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1% WEHI-3 supernatant. On the day of assay, cells are washed once with DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant), then 1 X 10\n6\n cells/mL are cultured in the presence of a known concentration of test peptide, or with EPO (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) as a positive control, in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant). Serial dilutions of the test peptide are concurrently tested in this assay. Assay plates are incubated for 4h at 37°C in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere, after which luciferin (Steady-Glo; Promega, Madison, WI) is added to each well. Following a 5-minute incubation, light emission is measured on a Packard Topcount Luminometer (Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, 111.). Light counts are plotted relative to test peptide concentration and analysed using Graph Pad software. The concentration of test peptide that results in a half-maximal emission of light is recorded as the EC50\n\n\n2. Proliferation assay This assay is based upon a murine pre-B-cell line, Baf3, transfected to express human EPO-R.\n\n\nProliferation of the resulting cell line, BaF3/Gal4/Elk/EPOR, is dependent on EPO-R activation. The degree of cell proliferation is quantitated using MTT, where the signal in the MTT assay is proportional to the number of viable cells.\n\n\nThe BaF3/Gal4/Elk/EPOR cells are cultured in spinner flasks in DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and 2% WEHI-3 supernatant (ATCC # TIB-68). Cultured cells are starved overnight, in a spinner flask at a cell density of IxIO\n6\n cells/ml, in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1% WEHI-3 supernatant. The starved cells are then washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS (Gibco), and resuspended to a density of IxIO\n6\n cells/ml in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant). 50μL aliquots (-50,000 cells) of the cell suspension are then plated, in triplicate, in 96 well assay plates. 50μL aliquots of dilution series of test EPO mimetic peptides, or 50μL EPO (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) or Aranesp™ (darbepoeitin alpha, an ERO-R agonist commercially available from Amgen) in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant I) are added to the 96 well assay plates (final well volume of lOOμL). For example, 12 different dilutions may be tested where the final concentration of test peptide (or control EPO peptide) ranges from 81OpM to 0.0045pM. The plated cells are then incubated for 48h at 37°C. Next, lOμL of MTT (Roche Diagnostics) is added to each culture dish well, and then allowed to incubate for 4h. The reaction is then stopped by adding 10% SDS + 0.01N HCl. The plates are then incubated overnight at 37°C. Absorbance of each well at a wavelength of 595nm is then measured by spectrophotometry. Plots of the absorbance readings versus test peptide concentration are constructed and the EC50 calculated using Graph Pad software. The concentration of test peptide that results in a half-maximal absorbance is recorded as the EC50. \n\n 3. Competitive Binding Assay\n\n\nCompetitive binding calculations are made using an assay in which a light signal is generated as a function of the proximity of two beads: a streptavidin donor bead bearing a biotinylated EPO-R- binding peptide tracer and an acceptor bead to which is bound EPO-R. Light is generated by non- radiative energy transfer, during which a singlet oxygen is released from a first bead upon illumination, and contact with the released singlet oxygen causes the second bead to emit light. These bead sets are commercially available (Packard). Bead proximity is generated by the binding of the EPO-R-binding peptide tracer to the EPO-R. A test peptide that competes with the EPO-R-binding peptide tracer for binding to EPO-R will prevent this binding, causing a decrease in light emission. In more detail the method is as follows: Add 4μL of serial dilutions of the test EPO-R agonist peptide, or positive or negative controls, to wells of a 384 well plate. Thereafter, add 2μL / well of receptor/bead cocktail. Receptor bead cocktail consists of: 15μL of 5mg/ml streptavidin donor beads (Packard), 15μL of 5mg/ml monoclonal antibody abl79 (this antibody recognizes the portion of the human placental alkaline phosphatase protein contained in the recombinant EPO-R), protein A-coated acceptor beads (protein A will bind to the abl79 antibody; Packard), 112.5μL of a 1:6.6 dilution of recombinant EPO-R (produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells as a fusion protein to a portion of the human placental alkaline phosphatase protein which contains the abl79 target epitope) and 607.5μL of Alphaquest buffer (4OmM HEPES, pH 7.4; ImM MgCl\n2\n; 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20). Tap to mix. Add 2μL/well of the biotinylated EPO-R-binding peptide tracer, (3OnM final concentration). The petpide tracer, an EPO-R binding peptide (see in the tables \"Reporter EC50 (pM)\"), is made according to the methods described in Example 1, using SEQ ID NO: 4.\n\n\nPeptide Tracer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentrifuge 1 min to mix. Seal plate with Packard Top Seal and wrap in foil. Incubate overnight at room temperature. After 18 hours read light emission using an AlphaQuest reader (Packard). Plot light emission vs. concentration of peptide and analyze with Graph Pad or Excel.\n\n\nThe concentration of test peptide that results in a 50% decrease in light emission, relative to that observed without test peptide, is recorded as the IC50.\n\n\n4. C/BFU-e Assay\n\n\nEPO-R signaling stimulates the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells into proliferating red blood cell precursors. This assay measures the ability of test peptides to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of red blood cell precursors from primary human bone marrow pluripotent stem cells. \n\n For this assay, serial dilutions of test peptide are made in IMDM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone). These serial dilutions, or positive control EPO peptide, are then added to methylcellulose to give a final volume of 1.5mL. The methylcellulose and peptide mixture is then vortexed thoroughly. Aliquots (100,000 cells/mL) of human, bone marrow derived CD34+ cells (Poietics/Cambrex) are thawed. The thawed cells are gently added to 0.1 mL of lmg/ml DNAse (Stem Cells) in a 5OmL tube. Next, 40-50 mL IMDM medium is added gently to cells: the medium is added drop by drop along the side of the 5OmL tube for the first 1OmL, and then the remaining volume of medium is slowly dispensed along the side of the tube. The cells are then spun at 900rpm for 20 min, and the media removed carefully by gentle aspiration. The cells are resuspended in ImI of IMDM medium and the cell density per mL is counted on hemacytometer slide (lOμL aliquot of cell suspension on slide, and cell density is the average count X 10,000 cells/ml). The cells are then diluted in IMDM medium to a cell density of 15,000 cells/mL. A lOOμL of diluted cells is then added to each 1.5 mL methyl cellulose plus peptide sample (final cell concentration in assay media is 1000 cells/ mL), and the mixture is vortexed. Allow the bubbles in the mixture to disappear, and then aspirate ImL using blunt-end needle. Add 0.25 mL aspirated mixture from each sample into each of 4 wells of a 24-well plate (Falcon brand). Incubate the plated mixtures at 37\n0\nC under 5% CO\n2\n in a humid incubator for 14 days. Score for the presence of erythroid colonies using a phase microscope (5X-10X objective, final magnification of 100X). The concentration of test peptide at which the number of formed colonies is 90% of maximum, relative to that observed with the EPO positive control, is recorded as the EC90 [See Table 2: C/BFU-e EC90]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8: In vivo activity assays\n\n\nThis example describes various in vivo assays that are useful in evaluating the activity and potency of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention. EPO-R agonist peptide monomers and dimers are prepared according to the methods provided in Example 1. The in vivo activity of these peptide monomers and dimers is evaluated using a series assays, including a polycythemic exhypoxic mouse bioassay and a reticulocyte assay. These two assays are described in further detail below.\n\n\n1. Polycythemic Exhypoxic Mouse Bioassay Test peptides are assayed for in vivo activity in the polycythemic exhypoxic mouse bioassay adapted from the method described by Cotes and Bangham (1961), Nature 191: 1065-1067. This assay examines the ability of a test peptide to function as an EPO mimetic: i.e., to activate EPO-R and induce new red blood cell synthesis. Red blood cell synthesis is quantitated based upon incorporation of radiolabeled iron into hemoglobin of the synthesized red blood cells. BDFl mice are allowed to acclimate to ambient conditions for 7-10 days. Body weights are determined for all animals, and low weight animals (<15 grams) are not used. Mice are subjected to successive conditioning cycles in a hypobaric chamber for a total of 14 days. Each 24 hour cycle consists of 18 hr at 0.40+0.02% atmospheric pressure and 6 hr at ambient pressure. After conditioning the mice are maintained at ambient pressure for an additional 72 hr prior to dosing. Test peptides, or recombinant human EPO standards, are diluted in PBS + 0.1% BSA vehicle\n\n\n(PBS/BSA). Peptide monomer stock solutions are first solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Negative control groups include one group of mice injected with PBS/BSA alone, and one group injected with 1% DMSO. Each dose group contains 10 mice. Mice are injected subcutaneously (scruff of neck) with 0.5 mL of the appropriate sample. Forty eight hours following sample injection, the mice are administered an intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 ml of Fe\n59\n (Dupont, NEN), for a dose of approximately 0.75 μCuries/mouse. Mouse body weights are determined 24hr after Fe\n59\n administration, and the mice are sacrificed 48hr after Fe\n59\n administration. Blood is collected from each animal by cardiac puncture and hematocrits are determined (heparin was used as the anticoagulant). Each blood sample (0.2 ml) is analyzed for Fe\n59\n incorporation using a Packard gamma counter. Non-responder mice (i.e., those mice with radioactive incorporation less than the negative control group) are eliminated from the appropriate data set. Mice that have hematocrit values less than 53% of the negative control group are also eliminated.\n\n\nResults are derived from sets of 10 animals for each experimental dose. The average amount of radioactivity incorporated [counts per minute (CPM)] into blood samples from each group is calculated. \n\n 2. Reticulocyte Assay\n\n\nNormal BDFl mice are dosed (0.5 mL, injected subcutaneously) on three consecutive days with either EPO control or test peptide. At day three, mice are also dosed (0.1 mL, injected intraperitoneally) with iron dextran (100 mg/ml). At day five, mice are anesthetized with CO\n2\n and bled by cardiac puncture. The percent (%) reticulocytes for each blood sample is determined by thiazole orange staining and flow cytometer analysis (retic-count program). Hematocrits are manually determined. The corrected percent of reticulocytes is determined using the following formula: % RETICcoRRECTED = % RETICoBSERVED X (HematocritnroiviDUAL / Hematocrit\nNO\nRMAL)\n\n\n3. Hematological Assay\n\n\nNormal CDl mice are dosed with four weekly bolus intravenous injections of either EPO positive control, test peptide, or vehicle. A range of positive control and test peptide doses, expressed as mg/kg, are tested by varying the active compound concentration in the formulation. Volumes injected are 5ml/kg. The vehicle control group is comprised twelve animals, while 8 animals are in each of the remaining dose groups. Daily viability and weekly body weights are recorded.\n\n\nThe dosed mice are mice are fasted and then anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane and terminal blood samples are collected via cardiac or abdominal aorta puncture on Day 1 (for vehicle control mice) and on Days 15 and 29 (4 mice/group/day). The blood is transferred to Vacutainer\n®\n brand tubes. Preferred anticoagulant is ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Blood samples are evaluated for endpoints measuring red blood synthesis and physiology such as hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hgb) and total erythrocyte count (RBC) using automated clinical analyzers well known in the art (e.g., those made by Coulter, Inc.).\n\n\nExample 9: Synthesis of EPO-R agonist peptide homodimers of peptide monomers having the amino acid sequence (AcG)GL YACHMGPIT(l-nal) VCQPLRK (SEQ ID NO: 1)\n\n\nStep 1 - Synthesis of peptide monomers: Peptide monomers are synthesized using standard Fmoc chemistry on an ABI 43 IA peptide synthesizer, using TG-RAM resin (0.18 mmol/g Rapp Polymere, Germany). For the synthesis of peptide monomers with an amidated carboxy terminus, the fully assembled peptide is cleaved from the resin with 82.5% TFA, 5% water, 6.25% anisole, 6.25% ethanedithiol. The deprotected product is filtered from the resin and precipitated with diethyl ether. After thorough drying the product is purified by C18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with a gradient of acetonitrile/water in 0.1 % trifluoro acetic acid. The structure of the peptide is confirmed by electospray mass spectrometry. The peptide monomers may be illustrated as follows: \n\n (AcG)GL Y ACHMGPIT(I -nal) VCQPLRK-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO 1)\n\n\nStep 2 - Synthesis of the trifunctional linker:\n\n\nTo a solution of diethyl iminoacetate (10. Og, 52.8 mmol) and Boc-beta-alanine (10.0g, 52.8 mmol) in 100 mL of DCM was added diisopropylcarbodiimide (8.0 mL, 51.1 mmol) over 10 minutes at room temperature. The reaction mixture warmed to -10 degrees during the addition, then cooled back to room temperature over 20 minutes. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir overnight and the precipitated diisopropylurea was filtered off. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford a gum, and the residue dissolved in ethyl acetate and again filtered to remove the additional precipitated urea. The organic phase was placed into a separtory funnel, washed (sat. NaHCO\n3\n, brine, 0.5 N HCl, brine), dried (MgSO\n4\n), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the diester product as a colorless oil. The diester was taken up in a 1 :1 mixture of MeOHiTHF (100 mL) and to this was added water (25 mL), and then NaOH (5g, 125 mmol). The pH was measured to be >10. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h, and then acidified to pH 1 with 6N HCl. The aq. Phase was saturated with NaCl and extracted 4 times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phase was washed (brine), dried (MgSO\n4\n), and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a white semi-solid.

The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford the diacid as a white solid (14.7 g, 91.5% yield for 2 steps). To a solution of the diacid (Ig, 3.29 mmol) in 20 mL of DMF was added N-hydroxysuccinimide (770 mg, 6.69 mmol) and diisopropylcarbodiimide (1.00 mL, 6.38 mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (3 mg, 0.02 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The residue was taken up in ethyl acetate and filtered to remove the precipitated urea. The organic phase was placed into a separtory funnel, washed (sat. NaHCO\n3\n, brine, 0.5 N HCl, brine), dried (MgSO\n4\n), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the di-NHS ester product as a white solid (1.12g, 68% yield).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3 - Coupling of the trifunctional linker to the peptide monomers:\n\n\nFor coupling to the linker, 2 eq peptide is mixed with 1 eq of trifunctional linker in dry DMF to give a clear solution, and 5eq of DIEA is added after 2 minutes. The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 14h. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the crude product is \n\n dissolved in 80% TFA in DCM for 30min to remove the Boc group, followed by purification with C18 reverse phase HPLC. The structure of the dimer is confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. This coupling reaction attaches the linker to the nitrogen atom of the ε-amino group of the lysine residue of each monomer. Coupling using SEQ ID NO: 1 is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4 - Synthesis of PEG moiety comprising two linear PEG chains linked by Lysine mPEG2-Lysinol-NPC\n\n\nLysinol, which may be obtained commercially, is treated with an excess of mPEG2-NPC to obtain MPEG2-lysinol, which is then reacted with NPC to form mPEG2-lysinol-NPC. mPEG2-Lys-NHS\n\n\nThis product may be obtained commercially, for example, from the Molecular Engineering catalog (2003) of Nektar Therapeutics (490 Discovery Drive, Huntsville, Alabama 35806), item no. 2Z3X0T01. \n\n Step 5 - PEGylation of the peptide dimer: PEGylation via a carbamate bond: The peptide dimer and the PEG species (mPEG\n2\n-Lysinol-NPC) are mixed in a 1 :2 molar ratio in dry DMF to afford a clear solution. After 5 minutes 4eq of DIEA is added to above solution. The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature 14h, followed by purification with C 18 reverse phase HPLC. The structure of PEGylated peptide is confirmed by MALDI mass. The purified peptide was also subjected to purification via cation ion exchange chromatography as outlined below.

The structure of PEGylated peptide was confirmed by MALDI mass. The purified peptide was also subjected to purification via cation ion exchange chromatography as outlined below. PEGylation using mPEG\n2\n-Lys-NHS using SEQ ID NO: 1 is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: - Ion exchange purification of peptides: Several exchange supports were surveyed for their ability to separate the above peptide-PEG conjugate from unreacted (or hydrolyzed) PEG, in addition to their ability to retain the starting dimeric peptides. The ion exchange resin (2-3g) was loaded into a 1 cm column, followed by conversion to the sodium form (0.2 N NaOH loaded onto column until elutant was pH 14, ca. 5 column volumes), and than to the hydrogen form (eluted with \n\n either 0.1 N HCl or 0.1 M HOAc until elutant matched load pH, ca. 5 column volumes), followed by washing with 25% ACN/water until pH 6. Either the peptide prior to conjugation or the peptide-PEG conjugate was dissolved in 25% ACN/water (10 mg/mL) and the pH adjusted to <3 with TFA, then loaded on the column. After washing with 2-3 column volumes of 25% ACN/water and collecting 5 mL fractions, the peptide was released from the column by elution with 0.1 M NH\n4\nOAc in 25% ACN/water, again collecting 5 mL fractions. Analysis via HPLC revealed which fractions contained the desired peptide. Analysis with an Evaporative Light-Scattering Detector (ELSD) indicated that when the peptide was retained on the column and was eluted with the NH\n4\nOAc solution (generally between fractions 4 and 10), no non-conjugated PEG was observed as a contaminant. When the peptide eluted in the initial wash buffer (generally the first 2 fractions), no separation of desired PEG- conjugate and excess PEG was observed.\n\n\nThe following columns successfully retained both the peptide and the peptide-PEG conjugate, and successfully purified the peptide-PEG conjugate from the unconjugated peptide:\n\n\nTable 5: Ion Exchange Resins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10: Synthesis of EPO-R agonist peptide homodimers of peptide monomers having the amino acid sequence (AcG)GL YACHMGPIT(l-nal) VCQPLR(MeG)K (SEQ ID NO: 2)\n\n\nEPO-R agonist peptide homodimers of peptide monomers having the amino acid sequence (AcG)GLY ACHMGPIT(I -nal) VCQPLR(MeG)K (SEQ ID NO: 2) are synthesized as described in Example 1, except that in Step 1 the synthesized peptide monomers are:\n\n\n(AcG)GL YACHMGPIT(l-nal) VCQPLR(MeG)K (§\nE\nQ J\nD N\nQ. \n2\n)\n\n\nWhere the PEG is attached to the spacer via carbamate linkages, the final product of this synthesis using SEQ ID NO: 2 may be illustrated structurally as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere the PEG is attached to the spacer via amide linkages, the final product of this synthesis using SEQ ID NO: 2 may be illustrated structurally as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11: In vitro activity assays\n\n\nThis example describes various in vitro assays that are useful in evaluating the activity and potency of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention. The results for these assays demonstrate that the novel peptides of this invention bind to EPO-R and activate EPO-R signaling. Moreover, the results for these assays show that the novel peptide compositions exhibit a surprising increase in EPO-R binding affinity and biological activity compared to EPO mimetic peptides that have been previously described. \n\n EPO-R agonist peptide monomers and dimers are prepared according to the methods provided in Example 1 or Example 2. The potency of these peptide dimers is evaluated using a series of in vitro activity assays, including: a reporter assay, a proliferation assay, a competitive binding assay, and a C/BFU-e assay. These four assays are described in further detail below. The results of these in vitro activity assays are summarized in Table 2.\n\n\n1. Reporter assay\n\n\nThis assay is based upon a on a murine pre-B-cell lin derived reporter cell, Baf3/EpoR/GCSFR fos/lux. This reporter cell line expresses a chimeric receptor comprising the extra-cellular portion of the human EPO receptor to the intra-cellular portion of the human GCSF receptor. This cell line is further transfected with a fos promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene construct. Activation of this chimeric receptor through addition of erythropoietic agent results in the expression of the luciferase reporter gene, and therefore the production of light upon addition of the luciferase substrate luciferin. Thus, the level of EPO-R activation in such cells may be quantitated via measurement of luciferase activity.\n\n\nThe Baf3/EpoR/GCSFR fos/lux cells are cultured in DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), 10% WEHI-3 supernatant (the supernatant from a culture of WEHI-3 cells, ATCC # TIB-68), and penicillin/streptomycin. Approximately 18 h before the assay, cells are starved by transferring them to DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1% WEHI-3 supernatant. On the day of assay, cells are washed once with DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant), then 1 X 10\n6\n cells/mL are cultured in the presence of a known concentration of test peptide, or with EPO (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) as a positive control, in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant). Serial dilutions of the test peptide are concurrently tested in this assay. Assay plates are incubated for 4h at 37°C in a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere, after which luciferin (Steady-Glo; Promega, Madison, WI) is added to each well. Following a 5-minute incubation, light emission is measured on a Packard Topcount Luminometer (Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, 111.). Light counts are plotted relative to test peptide concentration and analysed using Graph Pad software. The concentration of test peptide that results in a half-maximal emission of light is recorded as the EC50\n\n\n2. Proliferation assay This assay is based upon a murine pre-B-cell line, Baf3, transfected to express human EPO-R.\n\n\nProliferation of the resulting cell line, BaF3/Gal4/Elk/EPOR, is dependent on EPO-R activation. The \n\n degree of cell proliferation is quantitated using MTT, where the signal in the MTT assay is proportional to the number of viable cells.\n\n\nThe BaF3/Gal4/Elk/EPOR cells are cultured in spinner flasks in DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and 2% WEHI-3 supernatant (ATCC # Tffi-68). Cultured cells are starved overnight, in a spinner flask at a cell density of IxIO\n6\n cells/ml, in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1% WEHI-3 supernatant. The starved cells are then washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS (Gibco), and resuspended to a density of IxIO\n6\n cells/ml in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant). 50μL aliquots (-50,000 cells) of the cell suspension are then plated, in triplicate, in 96 well assay plates. 50μL aliquots of dilution series of test EPO mimetic peptides, or 50μL EPO (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) or Aranesp™ (darbepoeitin alpha, an ERO-R agonist commercially available from Amgen) in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant I) are added to the 96 well assay plates (final well volume of lOOμL). For example, 12 different dilutions may be tested where the final concentration of test peptide (or control EPO peptide) ranges from 81OpM to 0.0045pM. The plated cells are then incubated for 48h at 37°C. Next, lOμL of MTT (Roche Diagnostics) is added to each culture dish well, and then allowed to incubate for 4h. The reaction is then stopped by adding 10% SDS + 0.01N HCl. The plates are then incubated overnight at 37°C. Absorbance of each well at a wavelength of 595nm is then measured by spectrophotometry. Plots of the absorbance readings versus test peptide concentration are constructed and the EC50 calculated using Graph Pad software. The concentration of test peptide that results in a half-maximal absorbance is recorded as the EC50.\n\n\n3. Competitive Binding Assay\n\n\nCompetitive binding calculations are made using an assay in which a light signal is generated as a function of the proximity of two beads: a streptavidin donor bead bearing a biotinylated EPO-R- binding peptide tracer and an acceptor bead to which is bound EPO-R. Light is generated by non- radiative energy transfer, during which a singlet oxygen is released from a first bead upon illumination, and contact with the released singlet oxygen causes the second bead to emit light. These bead sets are commercially available (Packard). Bead proximity is generated by the binding of the EPO-R-binding peptide tracer to the EPO-R. A test peptide that competes with the EPO-R-binding peptide tracer for binding to EPO-R will prevent this binding, causing a decrease in light emission.\n\n\nIn more detail the method is as follows: Add 4μL of serial dilutions of the test EPO-R agonist peptide, or positive or negative controls, to wells of a 384 well plate. Thereafter, add 2μL / well of receptor/bead cocktail. Receptor bead cocktail consists of: 15μL of 5mg/ml streptavidin donor beads (Packard), 15μL of 5mg/ml monoclonal antibody abl79 (this antibody recognizes the portion of the human placental alkaline phosphatase protein contained in the recombinant EPO-R), protein A-coated acceptor beads (protein A will bind to the abl79 antibody; Packard), 112.5μL of a 1:6.6 dilution of \n\n recombinant EPO-R (produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells as a fusion protein to a portion of the human placental alkaline phosphatase protein which contains the abl79 target epitope) and 607.5μL of Alphaquest buffer (4OmM HEPES, pH 7.4; ImM MgCl\n2\n; 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20). Tap to mix. Add 2μL/well of the biotinylated EPO-R-binding peptide tracer, (3OnM final concentration). The peptide tracer, an EPO-R binding peptide (see in the tables \"Reporter EC50 (pM)\"), is made according to the methods described in Example 1 using SEQ ID NO: 4.\n\n\nPeptide Tracer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentrifuge 1 min to mix. Seal plate with Packard Top Seal and wrap in foil. Incubate overnight at room temperature. After 18 hours read light emission using an AlphaQuest reader (Packard). Plot light emission vs. concentration of peptide and analyze with Graph Pad or Excel.\n\n\nThe concentration of test peptide that results in a 50% decrease in light emission, relative to that observed without test peptide, is recorded as the IC50.\n\n\n4. C/BFU-e Assay\n\n\nEPO-R signaling stimulates the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells into proliferating red blood cell precursors. This assay measures the ability of test peptides to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of red blood cell precursors from primary human bone marrow pluripotent stem cells. For this assay, serial dilutions of test peptide are made in IMDM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone). These serial dilutions, or positive control EPO peptide, are then added to methylcellulose to give a final volume of 1.5mL. The methylcellulose and peptide mixture is then vortexed thoroughly. Aliquots (100,000 cells/mL) of human, bone marrow derived CD34+ cells (Poietics/Cambrex) are thawed. The thawed cells are gently added to 0.1 mL of lmg/ml DNAse (Stem Cells) in a 5OmL tube. Next, 40-50 mL IMDM medium is added gently to cells: the medium is added drop by drop along the side of the 5OmL tube for the first 1OmL, and then the remaining volume of medium is slowly dispensed along the side of the tube. The cells are then spun at 900rpm for 20 min, and the media removed carefully by gentle aspiration. The cells are resuspended in ImI of IMDM medium and the cell density per mL is counted on hemacytometer slide (lOμL aliquot of cell suspension on slide, and cell density is the average count X 10,000 cells/ml). The cells are then diluted in IMDM medium to a cell density of 15,000 cells/mL. A lOOμL of diluted cells is then added to each 1.5 mL methyl cellulose plus peptide sample (final cell concentration in assay media is 1000 cells/ mL), and the mixture is vortexed. Allow the bubbles in the mixture to disappear, and then aspirate ImL using blunt-end needle. Add 0.25 mL aspirated mixture from each \n\n sample into each of 4 wells of a 24-well plate (Falcon brand). Incubate the plated mixtures at 37\n0\nC under 5% CO\n2\n in a humid incubator for 14 days. Score for the presence of erythroid colonies using a phase microscope (5X-10X objective, final magnification of 100X). The concentration of test peptide at which the number of formed colonies is 90% of maximum, relative to that observed with the EPO positive control, is recorded as the EC90 [See Table 2: C/BFU-e EC90]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12: In vivo activity assays\n\n\nThis example describes various in vivo assays that are useful in evaluating the activity and potency of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention. EPO-R agonist peptide monomers and dimers are prepared according to the methods provided in Example 1. The in vivo activity of these peptide monomers and dimers is evaluated using a series assays, including a polycythemic exhypoxic mouse bioassay and a reticulocyte assay. These two assays are described in further detail below.\n\n\n1. Polycythemic Exhypoxic Mouse Bioassay Test peptides are assayed for in vivo activity in the polycythemic exhypoxic mouse bioassay adapted from the method described by Cotes and Bangham (1961), Nature 191 : 1065-1067. This assay examines the ability of a test peptide to function as an EPO mimetic: i.e., to activate EPO-R and induce new red blood cell synthesis. Red blood cell synthesis is quantitated based upon incorporation of radiolabeled iron into hemoglobin of the synthesized red blood cells. BDFl mice are allowed to acclimate to ambient conditions for 7-10 days. Body weights are determined for all animals, and low weight animals (<15 grams) are not used. Mice are subjected to successive conditioning cycles in a hypobaric chamber for a total of 14 days. Each 24 hour cycle consists of 18 hr at 0.40+0.02% atmospheric pressure and 6 hr at ambient pressure. After conditioning the mice are maintained at ambient pressure for an additional 72 hr prior to dosing. Test peptides, or recombinant human EPO standards, are diluted in PBS + 0.1% BSA vehicle\n\n\n(PBS/BSA). Peptide monomer stock solutions are first solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Negative control groups include one group of mice injected with PBS/BSA alone, and one group injected with 1% DMSO. Each dose group contains 10 mice. Mice are injected subcutaneously (scruff of neck) with 0.5 mL of the appropriate sample. Forty eight hours following sample injection, the mice are administered an intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 ml of Fe\n59\n (Dupont, NEN), for a dose of approximately 0.75 μCuries/mouse. Mouse body weights are determined 24hr after Fe\n59\n administration, and the mice are sacrificed 48hr after Fe\n59\n administration. Blood is collected from each animal by cardiac puncture and hematocrits are determined (heparin was used as the anticoagulant). Each blood sample (0.2 ml) is analyzed for Fe\n59\n incorporation using a Packard gamma counter. Non-responder mice (i.e., those mice with radioactive incorporation less than the negative control group) are eliminated from the appropriate data set. Mice that have hematocrit values less than 53% of the negative control group are also eliminated.\n\n\nResults are derived from sets of 10 animals for each experimental dose. The average amount of radioactivity incorporated [counts per minute (CPM)] into blood samples from each group is calculated. \n\n 2. Reticulocyte Assay\n\n\nNormal BDFl mice are dosed (0.5 mL, injected subcutaneously) on three consecutive days with either EPO control or test peptide. At day three, mice are also dosed (0.1 mL, injected intraperitoneally) with iron dextran (100 mg/ml). At day five, mice are anesthetized with CO\n2\n and bled by cardiac puncture. The percent (%) reticulocytes for each blood sample is determined by thiazole orange staining and flow cytometer analysis (retic-count program). Hematocrits are manually determined. The corrected percent of reticulocytes is determined using the following formula: % RETICcoRRECTED = % RETICoBSERVED X (HematocritjNDiviDUAL / HematocritNORMAL)\n\n\n3. Hematological Assay\n\n\nNormal CDl mice are dosed with four weekly bolus intravenous injections of either EPO positive control, test peptide, or vehicle. A range of positive control and test peptide doses, expressed as mg/kg, are tested by varying the active compound concentration in the formulation. Volumes injected are 5ml/kg. The vehicle control group is comprised twelve animals, while 8 animals are in each of the remaining dose groups. Daily viability and weekly body weights are recorded.\n\n\nThe dosed mice are mice are fasted and then anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane and terminal blood samples are collected via cardiac or abdominal aorta puncture on Day 1 (for vehicle control mice) and on Days 15 and 29 (4 mice/group/day). The blood is transferred to Vacutainer\n®\n brand tubes. Preferred anticoagulant is ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Blood samples are evaluated for endpoints measuring red blood synthesis and physiology such as hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hgb) and total erythrocyte count (RBC) using automated clinical analyzers well known in the art (e.g., those made by Coulter, Inc.).\n\n\nExample 13: Increase in Hemoglobin Levels in Animals and Human Normal Healthy Volunteers (NHV)\n\n\n1. General\n\n\nBased on nonclinical and clinical data, Peptide I, a fully synthetic EPO receptor agonist, has the potential to safely and effectively alleviate anemia secondary to inadequate EPO production. It is anticipated that Peptide I may have several potential advantages over currently available EPO products, including: prolonged half-life and pharmacodynamic activity with an expected dosing interval of every 3 to 4 weeks which may translate into improved convenience and compliance; reduced potential for antibody mediated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) since there is no common amino acid sequence shared with endogenous EPO; potential for the treatment of patients with PRCA caused by antibodies to commercially available EPOs that cross-react with endogenous EPO; and enhanced stability with prolonged shelf life at room temperature compared to protein therapeutics. \n\n Since the primary amino acid sequence of Peptide I differs from that of recombinant Human EPO (rHuEPO), it is less likely to induce a cross-reactive immune response against endogenous EPO. Although very rare, a cross-reactive immune response can cause serious side effects associated with loss of potency for both recombinant human ESAs and endogenous EPO. In addition, since Peptide I is a synthetic peptide, its production avoids the potential risk of contamination of the drug with host cell material that may occur with recombinant protein products.\n\n\n2. Pharmacokinetics of Peptide I in Animals\n\n\nPeptide I is a potent stimulator of erythropoiesis with dose -dependent activity observed following single or repeat dose administration in mice, rats (normocythemic and nephrectomized), dogs, rabbits and monkeys. Pharmacology studies in rats and monkeys indicate that the rise in reticulocytes (immature RBCs) and RBCs as measured by hemoglobin levels is dose proportional.\n\n\nPharmacokinetic studies in rats, dogs and monkeys have demonstrated the sustained plasma persistence of Peptide I in comparison to currently marketed rHuEPO products. Elimination half life (t\n1/2\n) ranges from 21.5 - 30.7 hours in rats, to 73.7 hours in dogs. Biodistribution of Peptide I is primarily to the plasma fraction. Following IV administration of 9.87 mg Peptide I /kg to five-sixth nephrectomy rats, the t\n1/2\n was approximately 48 hours and clearance was low at 0.763 mL/h/kg (compared to 1.44 mL/h/kg in normocythemic rats) resulting in an increased AUC magnitude of 1.8.\n\n\n2. Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics of Peptide I in Humans 2.1. Overview and methods\n\n\nPeptide I has been tested in 20 NHV in one Phase 1 study. This first-in-human study with Peptide I was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, IV, escalating dose, safety and tolerability trial. The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of Peptide I, and to establish a pharmacologically active dose (PAD). Cohorts of seven male volunteers were scheduled to receive single doses of Peptide I or placebo in a 5:2 ratio. Cohorts were to be added at increasing dose levels until a PAD, as determined by an increase in hemoglobin from baseline values, was observed, at which point the dose level identified as the PAD would be repeated in another cohort of volunteers. The study was initiated in four cohorts were enrolled in a consecutive manner at Peptide I doses of 0.025, 0.05, 0.1 mg/kg, and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively (single dose per cohort). Results of the study showed that increases in reticulocyte count and hemoglobin levels were achieved after the third cohort received 0.1 mg/kg of Peptide I. This dose was repeated in the fourth cohort, to confirm the results observed in the third cohort. As such, the study was terminated. Unblinded results are summarized below. \n\n 2.2. Pharmacodynamic Results\n\n\nReticulocyte count (absolute number and percent) showed a dose-dependent increase with increasing Peptide I dose. Reticulocyte counts reached a maximum approximately 7 days postdose in all dose cohorts. A comparison of the maximum reticulocyte response, and reticulocyte vs. time curves (AUC\n0\n-i4d\nay\ns and AUC\n0\n-28d\nay\ns) showed significant differences among dose groups (p<0.05).\n\n\nThe hemoglobin response and change from baseline (both mean and maximum) over 28 days post-dose showed dose-dependent increases with increasing dose of Peptide I whereas the control group exhibited a slight decrease in hemoglobin over time secondary to the study related blood draws without concomitant exogenous stimulation of erythropoiesis [one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) p-value of 0.0001]. A one-way Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) using mixed models was used to compare individual changes from baseline over time among all four groups. The results of this analysis showed a significant dose-response among all four dose groups (p =0.0001), with significant differences between the 0.025 vs. 0.1 mg/kg groups (p=0.0027), as well as the 0.05 vs. 0.1 mg/kg groups (p=0.0113). The PAD of Peptide I that was associated with at least a 1.0 g/dL increase in hemoglobin was 0.1 mg/kg.\n\n\nAdditionally, subjects in Cohorts 3 and 4 (0.1 mg/kg Peptide I or placebo) were followed through 42 days post-dose. At Day 42, the average hemoglobin levels had returned to baseline in the subjects treated with 0.1 mg/kg Peptide I, but were still below baseline values in the placebo subjects.\n\n\nThus, at Day 42, as throughout the study, the difference in change from baseline hemoglobin was >0.5 g/dL between subjects dosed with 0.1 mg/kg Peptide I versus those dosed with placebo.\n\n\nSerum EPO levels transiently decreased with increasing Peptide I dose. Changes in other pharmacodynamic parameters (increased red cell count and hematocrit, transient decreases in ferritin and reticulocyte hemoglobin content, transient increase in soluble transferrin receptor protein, and transient decrease in EPO) were consistent with stimulation of erythropoiesis.\n\n\n2.3. Pharmacokinetic Results\n\n\nFollowing IV doses of 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg Peptide I over a 5 minute period, drug concentrations generally peaked at between 5 minutes and 1 hour after initiation of the infusion. In the 0.025 mg/kg dose group, Peptide I concentration peaked between 5 and 15 minutes, while t\nmax\n approached 1 hour for the 0.1 mg/kg dose. After C\nmax\n was achieved, plasma concentrations declined and were generally quantifiable (>25 ng/mL) up to 96 hours after the 0.025 mg/kg dose, up to Day 5 for the 0.05 mg/kg dose, and up to Day 7 for the 0.1 mg/kg dose. Calculated half-lives showed a small increase at the 0.1 mg/kg dose, with a range of: 16.7-21.9 hours (mean 19.2 hours) following the 0.025 mg/kg dose; 15.3-25.1 hours (mean 18.7 hours) following the 0.05 mg/kg dose; and 17.7-33.1 hours (mean 23.5 hours) after the 0.1 mg/kg dose. \n\n The drug's distribution and elimination appeared not to follow standard one or two compartment kinetics. First order kinetics were observed at lower drug concentrations only, suggesting saturation of metabolic/elimination processes at plasma concentrations in excess of approximately 400 ng/mL. Volume of distribution showed little change with dose (means of 2165, 1903, and 2010 mL for the 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg doses, respectively). Plasma clearance showed a small decline with dose, with geometric means of 78.0, 70.7 and, 59.2 mL/hr for the 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg doses, respectively. ANOVA of dose normalized C\nmax\n, and AUQo-\nmfuuty)\n data showed that C\nmax\n appeared to have a linear relationship with dose. However, AUQo-\nmf\ni\nmty)\n showed evidence of non- linearity at the highest dose of 0.1 mg/kg, possibly associated with the observed small decrease in drug clearance at higher doses.\n\n\n2.4. Safety Results\n\n\nFifteen subjects (4 of 8 receiving placebo and 11 of 20 receiving Peptide I) experienced a total of 28 adverse events (AEs) (6 in the placebo group and 22 in the Peptide I group). For subjects dosed with Peptide I, headache (4/20, 20.0%) and abdominal pain (2/20, 10.0%), nausea (2/20, 10.0%), and nasopharyngitis (2/20, 10.0%) were the more frequently reported events. All AEs, except one, were graded as mild (Grade 1). Most AEs observed among the Peptide I recipients (15/22) were considered probably not related to the study drug, Peptide I. There was no difference in frequency, severity or pattern of AEs between the 4 groups. There were no Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) or withdrawals from the study due to an AE; however, study drug was discontinued for one subject assigned to the 0.025 mg/kg dose of Peptide I due to a mild drug reaction. This reaction which started within 2 minutes of the infusion was a flush starting on the chest expanding to the face, with a sensation of feeling hot, uncomfortable and a scratchy throat. As a safety precaution, the infusion was discontinued for this subject. Symptoms resolved spontaneously and rapidly. No therapeutic intervention was required. There were no changes in vital signs. Laboratory parameters were normal including additional immunologic testing; therefore, the specific nature of this reaction cannot be elucidated. Similar (or more severe) drug reactions have been observed with many drugs, including other ESAs. In addition, patients should be observed during IV administration of Peptide I. An injection should be discontinued if a patient develops similar symptoms. One placebo recipient and one Peptide I recipient were given concomitant medications for mild headache and mild abdominal cramps, respectively. There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs) or laboratory values. None of the subjects in this trial developed antibodies specific to Peptide I. \n\n 2.5. Summary\n\n\nIn summary, Peptide I appeared safe and well tolerated after single IV doses of 0.025, 0.05, or 0.1 mg/kg, with a safety profile similar to placebo. The pharmacokinetic results showed a halflife ranging from approximately 15 to 33 hours, with a mean of 23.5 hours at the 0.1 mg/kg dose. The median was comparable for all doses, occurring 15 minutes after the start of the infusion. C\nmax\n appeared to have a linear relationship with dose; AUQo-\nmfnuty)\n appeared to be nonlinear at the 0.1 mg/kg dose. First order kinetics were observed at lower drug concentrations only, suggesting saturation of metabolic/elimination processes at plasma concentrations > 400 ng/mL. Peptide I showed pharmacological activity for reticulocytes at all doses evaluated; generally the responses were dose-dependent with greater and longer responses with increasing dose. The 0.1 mg/kg dose group was defined as the PAD in NHV as it was associated with a clinically and statistically significant increase in hemoglobin from baseline, with an average maximum increase from baseline of 1.36 + 0.39 g/dL among the 10 Peptide I recipients. Changes in other pharmacodynamic parameters (increased red cell count and hematocrit, transient decreases in ferritin and reticulocyte hemoglobin content, transient increase in soluble transferrin receptor protein, and transient decrease in EPO) were consistent with stimulation of erythropoiesis.\n\n\nIncorporated herein by reference in its entirety is the poster and abstract # 0470 presented at the European Hematology Association 10th Annual Congress in Stockholm on June 4, 2005.\n\n\nExample 14: Increase in Hemoglobin Levels of Pre-dialysis, Dialysis, and Oncology Patients\n\n\n1. Pre-dialysis patients\n\n\nA randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, sequential dose escalation study of the safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of single intravenous doses of Peptide I injection in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are not on dialysis and who have not had prior erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) treatment will be conducted. This study will evaluate the safety profile of single intravenous (IV) dose levels of Peptide I in CKD patients not on dialysis (pre dialysis patients). This study will also: evaluate the dose response relationships of a single dose of Peptide I on pharmacodynamic parameters including hemoglobin, reticulocytes, and iron stores; evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of single dose levels of Peptide I intravenously in pre dialysis patients; determine the pharmacologically active dose (PAD) intravenously in pre dialysis patients, e.g., the dose that results in >70% of patients achieving a > 1 g/dL hemoglobin increase from baseline\n\n\nThe endpoints of the study will include: adverse events (AEs); serious adverse events (SAES); pharmacokinetic parameters including C\nmax\n, AUC\n0\n-\nt\n AUCo-mfmity, hnp, Vd, and CL; pharmacologic parameters including reticulocytes, hemoglobin, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, and serum measures of iron stores (e.g., serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and transferrin receptor \n\n protein); average hemoglobin change from baseline; maximum hemoglobin change from baseline; proportion of treated patients who achieve a > 1 g/dL hemoglobin increase from baseline; and frequency of red blood cell transfusions.\n\n\nThe patients selected for the study will be those pre-dialysis patients aged 18-75 years with hemoglobin >9 g/dL and < 11 g/dL secondary to chronic kidney disease who have not had previous treatment with ESAs and who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled. In each cohort of 9 patients, patients will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of Peptide I (n=7) or placebo (n=2). To ensure availability of data for a minimum of 22 days in 5 Peptide I treated patients per cohort, the third and subsequent patients in a cohort who terminate study prior to day 22 will be replaced. Each replacement patient will be assigned to the same treatment group as the withdrawn patient. Patients who terminate from study after day 22 will not be replaced.\n\n\nUp to 6 dose level cohorts (up to 4 planned dose levels and LIP to 2 additional lower, intermediate, and/or repeat [confirmatory] dose levels) are planned to be sequentially enrolled as determined by the Independent Safety Monitor, Investigator, and Sponsor. A maximum of 54 evaluable patients may be enrolled in this trial.\n\n\nEach patient in the study is expected to participate for at least 28 days following dosing. Each patient will receive a single dose of Peptide I or placebo. Planned sequential Peptide I dose levels are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, sequential dose escalation study with up to G dose cohorts of 9 pre dialysis patients per cohort. In each cohort, patients will be followed through day 29, or until stabilization of adverse events, whichever occurs later. Hemoglobin levels will be followed in all patients until elevated levels return to within 0.5 g/dL of baseline levels.\n\n\nBaseline hemoglobin concentration is defined as the mean of the three most recent hemoglobin values prior to study drug dosing. During the study, changes in hemoglobin for a cohort initiation or stopping decision require confirmation by the next consecutive hemoglobin value.\n\n\nIf a patient's hemoglobin level reaches 14 g/dL, the patient should be phlebotomized if clinically indicated. If a patient's hemoglobin level reaches 16 g/dL (confirmed), the patient should be phlebotomized.\n\n\n- Ill - \n\n After dosing of the first cohort, subsequent enrollment of the next cohort at the next dose level will be based on protocol specified dose escalation criteria. Dose escalation to the next dose level cohort will be halted based on protocol specified stopping criteria. An unblinded, Independent Safety Monitor will review the unblinded clinical and laboratory data on an ongoing basis to determine when the dose escalation or stopping criteria have been met.\n\n\nThe Investigator clinic personnel and Sponsor clinical personnel will be blinded to individual patient treatment assignment and patient identified PK, hematologic, and iron parameter results including hematocrit, hemoglobin, MCHC (mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration), MCH (mean corpuscular hemoglobin), MCV (mean corpuscular volume), reticulocyte count, and reticulocyte hemoglobin content, or iron store results including ferritin, transferrin saturation, and transferrin receptor protein; however, these personnel may review de identified results for these parameters during the course of the study. These personnel will not have access to patient identified results for these parameters, as the results, if identified by patient, could potentially unblind to treatment assignment. Beginning when all evaluable patients (no less than 7) in a cohort reach day 22, dose escalation to the next cohort is allowed if no safety concerns are identified and: no patient in the cohort achieves a hemoglobin increase ≥l.O g/dL; or all patients who receive Peptide I and achieve a hemoglobin increase > 1.0 g/dL from baseline demonstrate either stability (within 0.5 g/dL of peak hemoglobin value) or reversibility (decrease from peak hemoglobin value) over a minimum of two time points.\n\n\nEnrollment of new patients into the current cohort and escalation to a new dose will be stopped if any of the following criteria are met: Two or more patients in a cohort have a Grade 3 or 4 Peptide I related adverse event; two or more patients who receive Peptide I in a cohort have a > 2.0 g/dL increase in hemoglobin (increase starting above baseline level) over any 4 week period; or two or more patients who receive Peptide I in a cohort exceed the upper limit of the target range of hemoglobin (>13 g/dL).\n\n\nIf no safety concerns are identified, additional cohorts of 9 patients may be initiated after the all evaluable patients (no less than 7) in a cohort have reached day 22 to study confirmatory (repeat), lower, or intermediate doses. It is expected that for the pre-dialysis patients, a PAD of 0.025 to 0.2 mg/kg, possibly 0.05-\n\n\n0.1 mg/kg, possibly 0.067 to 0.075 mg/kg, will be determined.\n\n\n2. Dialysis Patients\n\n\nAn open-label, multi-center, sequential, dose finding study of the safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of Peptide I injection administered intravenously for the maintenance treatment \n\n of anemia in chronic hemodialysis patients will be performed to determine the range of monthly intravenously administered Peptide I doses that maintains hemoglobin within 1.0 g/dL above or below baseline in hemodialysis patients whose hemoglobin values were stable on Epoetin alfa. This study will also evaluate the safety profile of up to 3 doses of Peptide I administered intravenously in hemodialysis patients; evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of up to 3 doses Peptide I administered intravenously in hemodialysis patients (in a subset of study patients).\n\n\nThe endpoints of the study include: average weekly hemoglobin change from baseline; number (%) of patients with hemoglobin within 1.0 g/dL above or below baseline through Week 13; number (%) of patients who maintain hemoglobin within 9.5 -13.0 g/dL through Week 13; number (\n0\nZo) of patients with no dose adjustments during the study and number (%) of patients with dose increase or decrease during the study; frequency of red blood cell transfusions; additional pharmacologic parameters including reticulocyte count (absolute and AUC), reticulocyte hemoglobin content, and serum measures of iron stores (e.g., serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and soluble transferrin receptor protein); adverse events; serious adverse events; and pharmacokinetic parameters including C\nmax\n, AUC\n0\n-\nt\n AUCo-\nm&mty\n, ti\n/2β\n, Vd, Vss and CL (in a subset of study patients). Results of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses will be used to determine the preliminary conversion factor that best predicts the monthly dose of Peptide I based on the weekly dose of Epoetin alfa.\n\n\nThe patients selected for the study will be those hemodialysis patients aged 18 years or older with stable hemoglobin maintained on a stable dose of commercially available Epoetin alfa and who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled. Up to 4 sequential dose level cohorts of 15 patients per cohort are planned to be enrolled at 3 to 10 clinical centers.\n\n\nTo ensure availability of data in a minimum of 10 patients per cohort who have received 3 Peptide I doses, the 6th and subsequent patients in a cohort who terminate study prior to receiving the 3rd dose will be replaced, up to a maximum of 4 replacements. Patients who terminate from study after receiving 3 doses will not be replaced.\n\n\nTwo dose level cohorts are initially planned to be sequentially enrolled. Depending on the observed safety profile and pharmacologic response, up to 2 additional cohorts of 15 patients each may be added to study lower, intermediate, and/or repeat (confirmatory) dose levels, and/or frequency of administration. A minimum of 30 and a maximum of 60 evaluable patients may be enrolled in this trial.\n\n\nEach patient in the study is expected to participate for approximately 15 weeks following a 4 week screening period.\n\n\nAn amendment to lengthen the dosing duration for an additional 12 weeks is planned pending availability of supportive data. \n\n Doses of Peptide I will be administered every 4 weeks for a total of three doses as rapid intravenous bolus injections over 30 seconds during the last 15 minutes of dialysis. Each patient in a cohort will receive open-label doses of Peptide I starting at a pre-specified Epoetin alfa-to-Peptide I conversion level. The dose will be escalated or de-escalated for the next cohort based on the dose response relationship observed in the previous cohort. The planned starting Peptide I dose level conversions are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Peptide I dose may be adjusted in individual patients as follows. Starting with the 3\nrd\n dose of the Peptide I study drug, the dose will be increased by 25% if a patient's confirmed hemoglobin decreases by > 1.0 g/dL from baseline or a patient's confirmed hemoglobin decreases by >0.5 g/dL from baseline to a level below 11 g/dL. Starting with the 3\nrd\n dose of study drug, the dose will be reduced by 25% if a patient's confirmed hemoglobin increases by > 1.5 g/dL from baseline or a patient's confirmed hemoglobin increases by > 0.5 g/dL from baseline to a level above 12 g/dL. The next dose will be reduced by 25% if at any time during the study a patient's confirmed hemoglobin increases (increase starting above baseline) by > 1.0 g/dL within any 2 week period. If at any time during the study, a patient's confirmed hemoglobin exceeds 12.5 g/dL, the next dose will be delayed until the hemoglobin decreases to 12.0 g/dL and the dose will be reduced by 25%.\n\n\nBaseline hemoglobin concentration is defined as the mean of the 3 most recent mid-week pre- dialysis hemoglobin values collected in the 3 weeks prior to administration of study drug. During the study, changes in hemoglobin level for individual dose adjustment or cohort initiation or stopping criteria decisions require confirmation with a repeat hemoglobin value at any time within 7 days.\n\n\nThis is an open-label, sequential dose finding trial with 2-4 treatment cohorts of 15 hemodialysis patients per cohort. Each patient will receive an intravenous dose of Peptide I every 4 weeks for a total of 3 doses. After receiving the first dose of Peptide I, patients will be seen at least weekly throughout the study. During the study, iron status will be maintained per Kidney Disease\n\n\nOutcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) treatment guidelines. \n\n Patients will be followed for a minimum of 42 days after the last administration of Peptide I, or until stabilization of adverse events, whichever occurs later. After ceasing treatment, hemoglobin levels will be followed in all patients until return to target range.\n\n\nIf a patient's hemoglobin level reaches 14 g/dL (confirmed), the patient may be phlebotomized per the Investigator's judgment. If a patient's hemoglobin level reaches 16 g/dL (confirmed), the patient will be phlebotomized. The method of phlebotomy will be done per the site's standard clinical practice. The volume of blood phlebotomized will be documented. Phlebotomized patients will discontinue receipt of Peptide I and postphlebotomy pharmacodynamic data will be excluded from analysis. After dosing of the first cohort, subsequent enrollment of the next cohort is based on protocol- specified dose escalation and de-escalation criteria. Once an appropriate dose level conversion factor is identified, the conversion factor dose level may be repeated in a confirmatory cohort. The Independent Safety Monitor and Sponsor will review the clinical and laboratory data on an ongoing basis to determine when the dose escalation, de-escalation, additional cohort, or stopping criteria have been met.\n\n\nBeginning at the Week 7 data review of 6 or more patients enrolled in a cohort, enrollment into the current cohort may be stopped and dose escalation to the next cohort is allowed if no safety concerns are identified by the Independent Safety Monitor and a combined 6 or more patients have a confirmed hemoglobin decrease from baseline of more than 1.0 g/dL at Week 7 or later. Beginning at the Week 7 data review of 6 or more patients enrolled in a cohort, enrollment into the current cohort may be stopped and dose de-escalation to the next cohort is allowed if no safety concerns are identified by the Independent Safety Monitor and a combined 6 or more patients have a confirmed hemoglobin increase > 1.0 g/dL from baseline to a hemoglobin value > 13.0 g/dL occurring at Week 7 or later or a confirmed hemoglobin increase > 1.0 g/dL (increase starting above baseline) within any two week period after study entry.\n\n\nBeginning at the Week 7 data review of 10 or more patients enrolled in a cohort, if no safety concerns are identified by the Independent Safety Monitor, an additional cohort may be initiated to study lower or intermediate (between the current and previously studied) conversion factors, and/or frequency of administration. A maximum of two additional cohorts may be enrolled. After the Week 7 data review of 10 or more patients enrolled in a cohort, a confirmatory cohort utilizing the same conversion factor may be initiated to repeat the same conversion factor and/or frequency of administration if no safety concerns are identified by the Independent Safety Monitor and neither dose escalation nor dose de-escalation rules have been met. \n\n Enrollment of new patients into the current cohort and escalation to a new dose will be stopped if the following criterion is met: 3 patients in a cohort have a Grade 3 or Grade 4 Peptide I - related adverse event.\n\n\nIt is expected that for the dialysis patients, a PAD of 0.025 to 0.2 mg/kg, possibly 0.05-0.1 mg/kg, possibly 0.067 to 0.075 mg/kg, will be determined.\n\n\n3. Oncology Patients\n\n\nAn open-label, multi-center dose-escalation study of the safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered Peptide I in cancer patients with chemotherapy induced anemia (CIA) will be conducted to determine the Peptide I dose to be administered every three weeks by subcutaneous (SC) injection associated with a hemoglobin response in patients with chemotherapy induced anemia. Other objectives include to: evaluate the safety profile of up to 4 doses of Peptide I administered subcutaneously every three weeks in cancer patients receiving concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy; determine the change from baseline in Hgb in patients with CIA at different dose levels of Peptide I; determine the proportion of patients who have a Hgb response to Peptide I (as defined in Endpoints); determine the dose of Peptide I administered subcutaneously that increases and maintains the hemoglobin in the target range of 11-13 g/dL in CIA patients; evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of up to 4 doses of Peptide I administered subcutaneously in CIA patients (in a subset of study patients); and explore the effect of dose frequency and parenteral iron replacement at an active dose of Peptide I.\n\n\nThe endpoints of the study will include: proportion of patients per treatment group who have > a 2 g/dL increase in hemoglobin OR who have an increase of Hgb of > 1 g/dL to at least 12 g/dL at 4 weeks, 9 weeks and 12 weeks in the absence of RBC transfusion in the previous 28 days; proportion of patients who have a Hgb increase of > 1 g/dL from baseline at 4 weeks, 9 weeks and 12 weeks in the absence of RBC transfusion in the previous 28 days; proportion of patients who have a Hgb in the target range of 11-13 g/dL at weeks 4, 9 and 12; proportion of Hgb values in the target range of 11-13 g/dL after week 4; average hemoglobin change from baseline; frequency of red blood cell transfusions; additional pharmacologic parameters including reticulocyte counts (absolute and AUC), reticulocyte hemoglobin content; changes in measures of iron stores, e.g. transferrin saturation and serum ferritin; adverse events (AEs); serious adverse events (SAEs); and in a subset of study patients pharmacokinetic parameters including C\nmax\n, AUQ\nM\n, AUC\nO\n-\n∞\n, ti\n/2β\n (elimination half-life), Vd (apparent volume of distribution), Vss (steady-state volume), and CL (clearance).\n\n\nThe patients selected for the study will be those with solid tumors or lymphoma, aged 18-80 years with hemoglobin > 9 g/dL and < 11 g/dL secondary to chemotherapy who have not had previous treatment with ESAs within the past 90 days and who meet eligibility criteria and will be assigned to\n\n\nPeptide I at the starting dose or subsequent sequential dose level approved by the Medical Monitor \n\n (MM). To ensure availability of 12 week data in of a minimum 10 treated patients per treatment group, the 6th and subsequent patients in a group who terminate the study prior to 8 weeks, will be replaced, up to a maximum of 5 replacements. Each replacement patient will be assigned to the same treatment group as the withdrawn patient. Up to 4 open-label treatment groups of 15 patients may be subsequently added to study lower, intermediate, and/or repeat dose levels and/or frequency of administration of Peptide I and/or parenteral iron replacement to maintain transferrin saturation levels at 25-50%. A minimum of 30 and a maximum of 90 patients (not including replacements) may be enrolled in this trial if all possible dosing regimens are explored.\n\n\nEach patient in the study is expected to participate for up to 12 weeks following up to a 4 week screening period.\n\n\nSequential cohorts of fifteen patients will receive escalating doses of Peptide I. Open-label doses will be administered by SC injection every 3 weeks for a total of four doses (Study weeks 1, 4, 7, 10). Typically, Peptide I would be administered on Day 1 of a chemotherapy cycle. The Peptide I starting doses and frequency of dosing are based on Phase 1 data in Healthy Volunteers as well as predicted responses modeled from PK/PD data of the erythropoietic response to Peptide I and other Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs). Planned Peptide I dose levels and the number of patients in each group are show in Table 7:\n\n\nTable 7 Peptide I Dose Levels and Patient Numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatients will be followed for 28 days post last injection, or until stabilization of adverse events, or hemoglobin values are between 11-13 g/dL which ever comes last. No dose increases will be allowed. After week 4, if RBC transfusions are required to maintain the Hgb in the target range, the patient will be removed from study drug, return to standard of care, and be followed for an additional 28 days for safety. If at any time during the study, a patient' s hemoglobin increases by > 1.0 g/dL within any 2 week period, the next dose will be delayed until the hemoglobin stabilizes (an increase of < 0.5 g/dL in a week) and the dose will be reduced by 50%. Baseline hemoglobin concentration is defined as the mean of the 2 most recent weekly hemoglobin values collected in the week prior to administration of study drug (e.g. screening and baseline values). During the study, changes in hemoglobin level for cohort initiation or stopping criteria decisions require confirmation by the next consecutive hemoglobin value within 7 days.\n\n\nThis is an open-label, multi-center trial with up to 6 treatment groups of 15 patients with CIA per group. In the initial treatment groups, open-label Peptide I will be administered by subcutaneous injection every 3 weeks for a total of up to 4 doses. After the first dose, patients will be seen at least \n\n weekly throughout the study. Patients will be followed for a minimum of 28 days after the last administration of study drug, or until stabilization of adverse events, or hemoglobin values are between 11-13 g/dL whichever occurs last. If a patient' s hemoglobin level reaches 14 g/dL (confirmed), the patient may be phlebotomized if clinically indicated and the volume of phlebotomy documented. Phlebotomized patients will discontinue receipt of study drug and post-phlebotomy pharmacodynamic data will be excluded from analysis. The Medical Monitor (MM), and Sponsor will review the safety and pharmacodynamic data on an ongoing basis to determine if and when the stopping criteria have been met.\n\n\nAfter 6 or more patients enrolled in a cohort have completed at least 6 weeks of follow up (i.e. at least three weeks following the second dose), enrollment into the current cohort may be stopped and dose escalation to the next cohort is allowed if there are: no safety concerns are identified by the MM; and, 6 or more patients are transfused after week 4 or have a confirmed hemoglobin increase of <1 g/dL at week 6.\n\n\nAfter 6 or more patients enrolled in a cohort and have completed at least 6 weeks of follow up (at least three weeks following the second dose), enrollment into the current cohort will be stopped and dose de-escalation to a lower level in the next cohort may be allowed if there is: an occurrence of at least 3 Grade 3 or 4 AEs possibly related to Peptide I or if the MM identifies any specific concern to Peptide I; or a total of 6 or more patients have a confirmed hemoglobin level > 13.0 g/dL (not related to transfusion), or a confirmed hemoglobin increase > 1.0 g/dL within any two week period (not related to transfusion)\n\n\nIf no safety concerns are identified by the MM and Sponsor, up to two additional open-label treatment groups of 15 patients may be initiated to study lower, intermediate (between the current and previously studied), or repeat dose levels. In addition, once the active dose administered every three weeks is determined, up to 2 additional cohorts may be enrolled to determine the relative effect of the same total dose administered in fractions at a different frequency (e.g., 4/3 of the every 3 week dose administered every 4 weeks). The effect of administration of parenteral iron to achieve a transferrin saturation of 25-50% may also be explored in a separate cohort.\n\n\nIt is expected that for the oncology patients, a PAD of 0.075-0.5 mg/kg, possibly 0.2-0.4 mg/kg, possibly 0.25 mg/kg, will be determined.\n\n\nExample 15: Long-Term Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacodynamics of Peptide I in a Phase II, Multi-Dose Study in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease\n\n\n1. Study Methods\n\n\nA multi-center, open-label, sequential dose-finding phase II clinical trial involving patients with chronic kidney disease was performed in order to evaluate the safety and pharmacodynamics of \n\n multiple doses of once-monthly (Q4W) subcutaneous (SC) delivery of Peptide I (SEQ ID NO:2). A total of 60 erythropoiesis-stimulating-agent-naϊve, pre-dialysis, chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients [hemoglobin (Hgb) levels 9.0-10.9 g/dL, ferritin >100 ug/L and transferrin saturation (TSAT) >20%] were enrolled into three dose cohorts. Patients received up to six once-monthly SC drug doses. The starting doses were 0.025 mg/kg (n=15), 0.050 mg/kg (n=30) and 0.075 mg/kg (n=15). Dose titration was allowed after the first dose, based on patient Hgb levels.\n\n\n2. Mean Baseline Characteristics and Individual Patient Dose Adjustments\n\n\nBaseline characteristics were were balance accross dose groups as shown in the Table :\n\n\nTable 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDose titrations were allowed after the patient's initial dose. Dose adjustments were +25% of the previous dose, depending on the patient's measured hemoglobin (Hgb) level. Patients (shown by percent) that were dose-titrated by week 12, are shown in Table 9.\n\n\nTable 9 Patients Dose-titrated by Week 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study pharmacodynamic results are shown in Figures 1-4. The mean reticulocyte change from baseline for 0-12 weeks is shown in Figure 1. The mean hemoglobin (Hgb) change from baseline for the study weeks 0-12 is shown in Figure 2. The correction of anaemia (Hgb >11 g/dL) by dose and treatment duration is shown in Figure 3 depicts. The mean hemoglobin (Hgb) change from baseline for the study weeks 12-22 is shown in Figure 4. The hemoglobin (Hgb) change from baseline for individual patients in the 0.05 mg/kg cohort for the study weeks 0 to 12 is shown in Figure 5. \n\n 3. Safety Results\n\n\nAdverse events and serious adverse events were monitored during the study. Eleven (18%) patients reported 36 adverse events. All events were assessed as not related to study drug. No adverse event resulted in study withdrawal, no injection site reaction was reported. All serious adverse events were assessed as not related to study drug.\n\n\n4. Conclusions\n\n\nPre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients can be effectively treated with Peptide I by monthly dosing via a subcutaneous injection. Multiple monthly subcutaneous Peptide I injections are well-tolerated. Monthly drug dosing achieves correction of anaemia in patients by week eight. The drug results in a sustained increase in hemoglobin (Hgb) up to week 22, when dosed monthly in patients with chronic kidney disease.\n\n\nExample 16: Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacodynamics of Peptide I in a Phase II Multi-Dose Study in Patients Suffering from Anemia Associated with Solid Tumor Malignancy or Lymphoma\n\n\n1. Study Methods\n\n\nA multi-center, open label, sequential dose-finding phase II clinical trial involving patients with cancer was performed in order to evaluate the safety and pharmacodynamics of multiple doses administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) subcutaneous (SC) delivery of Peptide I (SEQ ID NO: T). A total of 60 patients with solid tumor malignancy or lymphoma [ patients had greater than 9 weeks of chemotherapy and baseline hemoglobin levels greater than 8 g/dL but less than 11 g/dL and adequate iron, folate and B 12 stores] were enrolled into four dose cohorts. Patients received up to two SC drug doses which were given once every three weeks. The starting doses were 0.05 mg/kg (n=15), 0.10 mg/kg (n=15), 0.15 mg/kg (n=15), and 0.20 kg/mg (n=15).\n\n\n2. Mean Baseline Characteristics and Pharmacodynamic Results\n\n\nMean baseline hemoglobin values and the percent of patients completing the study across the four dose cohorts are shown in the following table. Table 10 below also shows the percent of patients at Week 7 of the study showing a mean increase from baseline hemoglobin of > 1 g/dL in the pharmacodynamic dataset comprising 42 patients across the four dose cohorts. \n\n Table 10 Percent of Patients at Week 7 with Mean Increase from Baseline Hemoglobin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Safety Results\n\n\nAdverse events and serious adverse events were monitored during the study. Three patients withdrew from the study due to adverse events that were assessed as not related to the study drug. Six patients withdrew from the study due to serious adverse events. One serious adverse event, thrombophlebitis, was probably related to the study drug; however the other five reports of serious adverse events were not attributed to the study drug. Three patient deaths occurred during the course of the drug study (two deaths due to disease progression and one death due to renal insufficiency). None of the deaths was attributed to the study drug.\n\n\n4. Conclusions\n\n\nPatients suffering from anemia associated with solid tumor malignancy or lymphoma who are also undergoing chemotherapy can be effectively treated with Peptide I by subcutaneous injection every three weeks. Subcutaneous injections of Peptide I every three weeks was well tolerated. By week 7 of the study, Peptide I resulted in a mean increase from baseline hemoglobin of > 1 g/dL in patients of the study.\n\n\nExample 17: Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacodynamics of Peptide I in a Phase II Multi-Dose Study in Patients Suffering from Anemia Associated with Solid Tumor Malignancy or Lymphoma 1. Study Methods\n\n\nA multi-center, open label, sequential dose-finding phase II clinical trial involving patients with cancer was performed in order to evaluate the safety and pharmacodynamics of multiple doses administered Q3W SC delivery of Peptide I (SEQ ID NO: 2). A total of 60 patients with solid tumor malignancy or lymphoma [ patients had greater than 9 weeks of chemotherapy and baseline \n\n hemoglobin levels greater than 8 g/dL but less than 11 g/dL and adequate iron, folate and B 12 stores and ECOG performance status of 0-2] were enrolled into four dose cohorts. Patients received at least two SC drug doses which were given once every three weeks. The starting doses were 0.05 mg/kg (n=15), 0.10 mg/kg (n=15), 0.15 mg/kg (n=15), and 0.20 kg/mg (n=15). 2. Mean Baseline Characteristics and Pharmacodynamic Results\n\n\nThe pharmacodynamic data set (n=49) included patients who received at least two (2) doses of Peptide I and had at least two (2) hemoglobin values at or after six (6) weeks following the first dose. Hemoglobin responses were determined in patients without red blood cell transfusions in the previous twenty-eight (28) days. Demographic and baseline characteristics for patients completing the study across the four dose cohorts are shown in the Table 11.\n\n\nTable 11 Patient Demographic and baseline characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 depicts an increase in hemoglobin from baseline of > 1 g/dL at 6 weeks following the first dose of 0.5 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.15 mg/kg, and 0.2 mg/kg of Peptide I (SEQ ID NO: 2) was observed in 17%, 73%, 55%, and 47% of patients, respectively. Figure 7 depicts the percent of patients at Week 6 after the first dose of the study showing a hemoglobin increase of > 2 g/dL or the combination of a > 1 g/dL increase and a hemoglobin value of at least 1 lg/dL occurred in 8%, 73%, 55%, and 40% of patients in the 0.5 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.15 mg/kg, and 0.2 mg/kg dose cohorts, respectively. As shown in Table 12, dose reductions and delays occurred more frequently in the 0.2 mg/kg cohort: \n\n Table 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 depicts that the patients in the 0.1 mg/kg, 0.15 mg/kg, and 0.2 mg/kg dose cohorts had increases in hemoglobin from baseline.\n\n\n3. Safety Results\n\n\nAdverse events and serious adverse events were monitored during the study. Forty-five (45) of the sixty (60) patients reported an adverse event. The most frequently reported adverse events were; nausea (22%), pyrexia (12%), vomiting (12%), anemia (10%), dyspnea (10%), constipation\n\n\n(8%), febrile neutropenia (8%). Eight (8) patients (representing 13%) had one or more of the adverse events considered related to the study drug. In two (2) patients, the following five events occurred: constipation, nausea, vomiting, abnormal hematology test, and increased reticulocyte count. One (1) patient suffered eleven (11) other related events. Thirty-seven (37) serious adverse were reported in eighteen (18) patients. One serious adverse event, thrombophlebitis, was probably related to the study drug; however the other reports of serious adverse events were not attributed to the study drug. The most frequently reported serious adverse events included: febrile neutropenia (8%), neutropenia (5%), neutropenic sepsis (5%), panctyopenia (5%), anemia (3%), and infection (3%). Three patient deaths due to serious adverse events occurred during the course of the drug study (one death due to pulmonary edema, one death due to disease progression and one death due to renal insufficiency). A fourth death occurred > one (1) month after study completion due to serious adverse events of pleural effusion and decreased performance status. None of the deaths was attributed to the study drug.\n\n\n4. Conclusions Patients suffering from anemia associated with solid tumor malignancy or lymphoma who are also undergoing chemotherapy can be effectively treated with Peptide I by subcutaneous injection every three weeks. Subcutaneous injections of Peptide I every three weeks was well tolerated. By week 6 of the study, Peptide I at doses of 0.1 mg/kg and 0.15 mg/kg administered by subcutaneous injection every three weeks in oncology patients also undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy resulted in an increase of hemoglobin of > 1 g/dL in 50% of patients of the study. The increase in \n\n hemoglobin in the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.15 mg/kg dose cohorts appeared to be sustained through nine (9) and twelve (12) weeks. The 0.05 mg/kg dose did not produce a meaningful increase in hemoglobin; however, hemoglobin values were maintained close to baseline. While forty-seven percent (47%) of the patients in the 0.2 mg/kg dose cohort had a hemoglobin increase of > 1 g/dL by week 6, this was not sustained. The trend toward a lower response rate and a lower average hemoglobin over time in 0.2 mg/kg dose cohort compared to the 0.1 mg/kg or 0.15 mg/kg dose cohorts is due to several factors, including: a greater number of dose delays and reductions secondary to initial substantial hemoglobin increases.\n\n\nHgb and Dose Analysis of Peptide I treatment in Cancer Patients\n\n\nAn open-label, multi-center dose escalation study of the safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered Peptide I in anemic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy was conducted. An objective of this study was to determine the dose of Peptide I administered every three weeks by subcutaneous (SC) injection associated with a hemoglobin increase of > 1 g/dL at 9 weeks in > 50% of anemic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The time frame of the study was approximately 13 weeks. Results of the study can be summarized, as shown in Table 13, which groups the results by the three cancer types studied, breast cancer, non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and prostate cancer. Further details are discussed below and presented in Tables 14-16.\n\n\nTable 13: Summary of Peptide I Treatment Results for Cancer Patients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther measures of the study included: (1) an evaluation of the safety profile of up to four doses of Peptide I administered subcutaneously every three weeks in cancer patients receiving concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy, (2) a determination of the change from baseline in hemoglobin (Hgb) in anemic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy at different dose levels of Peptide I, (3) a determination of the proportion of patients who have a Hgb response to Peptide I, (4) a determination of Peptide I administered subcutaneously that increases and maintains the hemoglobin in the target range of 11-13 g/dL in anemic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, (5) an evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of up to 4 doses of Peptide I administered subcutaneously in anemic \n\n cancer patients receiving chemotherapy (in a subset of study patients), (6) an exploration of the effect of dose frequency at an active dose of Peptide I, and (7) and exploration of the effect of parenteral iron replacement at an active dose of Peptide I.\n\n\nPatient inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1) the Patient was informed of the investigational nature of this study and gave written, witnessed informed consent in accordance with institutional, local, and national guidelines; (2) male or female > 18 and < 80 years of age; premenopausal females (with the exception of those who are surgically sterile) must have a negative pregnancy test at screening; those who are sexually active must practice a highly effective method of birth control for at least 2 weeks prior to study start, and must be willing to continue practicing birth control for at least 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs, sexual abstinence (only acceptable if practiced as a life-style and not acceptable if one who is sexually active practices abstinence only for the duration of study) or vasectomized partner; (3) Patients with histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy or lymphoma who are scheduled to receive at least 9 weeks of cyclic myelosuppressive chemotherapy while on study; (4) a hemoglobin value of > 8 and < 11 g/dL within 1 week prior to administration of study drug; (5) an ECOG Performance Status of 0-2; (6) one reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) > 29 pg within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration; (7) one transferrin saturation > 15% within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration; (8) one serum or red cell folate level above the lower limit of normal within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration; (9) one vitamin B\n12\n level above the lower limit of normal within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration; (10) one absolute neutrophil count > 1.0 X 10\n9\n/L within 1 week prior to administration of study drug; (11) one platelet count > 75 X 10\n9\n/L within one week prior to administration of study drug; and (12) a life expectancy > 6 months. If the patient was considered by the investigator as iron-deficient and IV iron supplementation was required, the patient was re-screened weekly (no sooner than 7 days after iron administration) until hemoglobin has not increased more than 0.5 g/dL from the previous week.\n\n\nPatient exclusion criteria included: (1) treatment with any erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) in the past 90 days; (2) history of failure to respond to ESA treatment; (3) known antibodies to other ESAs or history of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA); (4) acute or chronic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or multiple myeloma; (5) any previous or planned radiotherapy to more than 50% of either the pelvis or spine; (6) known intolerance to parenteral iron supplementation; (7) red-blood cell (RBC) transfusion within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration; (8) known hemoglobinopathy (e.g., homozygous sickle-cell disease, thalassemia of all types, etc.); (9) known hemolysis; (10) history of pulmonary embolism or DVT in the previous 2 years or current therapeutic doses of anticoagulants; (11) known blood loss as a cause of anemia; (12) uncontrolled, or \n\n symptomatic inflammatory disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.); (13) AST or ALT > 2.5 times the upper limit of normal; AST or ALT > 5 times the upper limit of normal if liver metastases are present; (14) creatinine > 175 μmol/L; (15) history of bone marrow or peripheral blood cell transplantation; (16) pyrexia/fever of > 39 \n0\nC within 48 hours prior to study drug administration; (17) poorly controlled hypertension, per the investigator's judgment, within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration (e.g., systolic > 170 mm Hg or diastolic > 100 mm Hg on repeat readings); (18) epileptic seizure in the 6 months prior to study drug administration; advanced chronic congestive heart failure - New York Heart Association Class IV; (19) high likelihood of early withdrawal or interruption of the study (e.g., myocardial infarction within the past 3 months; severe or unstable coronary artery disease; stroke; respiratory, autoimmune, neuropsychiatric or neurological abnormalities; liver disease including active hepatitis B or C; active HIV disease; or any other clinically significant medical diseases or conditions within the prior 6 months that may, in the investigator's opinion, interfere with assessment or follow-up of the patient); (20) anticipated elective surgery during the study period; (21) history of multiple drug allergies; (22) exposure to any investigational agent within 1 month prior to administration of study drug or planned receipt during the study period.\n\n\nTables 14-16 provide clinical results by cancer group. The data includes hemoglobin concentrations (the top portion of each table) and dosing information (bottom portion of each table) for Peptide I. The abbreviations used in these tables are as follows: \"Hgb\" refers to Hgb concentration in g/dL; \"n\" indicates the number of observations; \"std\" refers to standard deviation. \"Taxane\" indicates that the patient was being treated with a taxane-based chemotherapeutic agent. \"Non-Taxane\" indicates that the patient was being treated with a non-taxane based chemotherapeutic agent. Empty cells indicate that no data was obtained or that no dose was given. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n Sequence Listing\n\n\n<210> 1 <211> 20 <212> PRT <213> artificial\n\n\n<220>\n\n\n<223>

Description\n\n\n\n\n A Process for producing a Peptide Hormone\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a process for producing a peptide hormone, in particular, hepcidin. In particular, the present invention relates to a process for producing human hepcidin-20 and -25, and analogues thereof, including tagged forms thereof. There is also provided the use of the hepcidin of the present invention as a diagnostic and therapeutic agent.\n\n\nIron is an essential trace element for all living organisms due to its involvement in oxygen transport, cell proliferation, respiration and DNA synthesis. However, free iron is extremely toxic and promotes oxidative stress. Mammals do not possess a physiological excretion pathway and iron balance is maintained by the regulation of its absorption and storage (Hentze, M.W., M. U. Muckenthaler, and Andrews N. C. (2004) Ce// 117, 285-97).\n\n\nOne of the key regulators of human iron metabolism is the peptide hormone, hepcidin (Fleming, R. E. and Sly W.S. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL U.S.A. 98, 8160- 2). Hepcidin is a small cysteine rich peptide predominantly expressed in the liver (Pigeon, C, llyin, G., Courselaud, B., Leroyer, P., Turlin, B., Brissot, P., Loreal, O. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 7811-9) and synthesized as an 84 amino acid pre- propeptide. The mature product, corresponding to the carboxyl terminal region of the pre-propeptide, circulates in two predominant forms of 20 and 25 amino acids and is detectable in human serum and urine (Krause, A., Neitz, S., Magert, H. J., Schulz, A., Forssmann, W. G., Schulz-Knappe, P., Adermann, K. (2000) FEBS Lett. 480, 147-50 and Park, CH. , Valore, E. V., Waring, A. J., Ganz, T. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 7806-10). Both isoforms contain eight cysteine residues and give rise to a defensine- like peptide with antibacterial and antifungal activity (Krause, A., Neitz, S., Magert, H. J., Schulz, A., Forssmann, W. G., Schulz-Knappe, P., Adermann, K. (2000) FEBS Lett. 480, 147-50 and Park, C. H., Valore, E. V., Waring, A. J., Ganz, T. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 7806-10). NMR-structural studies revealed that hepcidin folds into a simple hairpin that is stabilized by four disulfide bonds, one of them is unusual and forms between two adjacent cysteines in the turn (Hunter, H.N., Fulton, D. B., Ganz, T., Vogel, H.J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 37597-603).\n\n\nThe involvement of hepcidin in iron metabolism was suggested by experiments showing that its expression is induced by dietary iron (Pigeon, C\n1\n llyin, G., Courselaud, B., Leroyer, P., Turlin, B., Brissot, P., Loreal, O. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. \n\n 276, 7811-9). Moreover, mice lacking hepcidin were found to develop a hemochromatosis phenotype with iron deposition in the liver parenchyma and sparing of macrophages (Nicolas, G., Bennoun, M., Devaux, I., Beaumont, C, Grandchamp, B., Kahn, A., Vaulong, S. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 98, 8780-5). On the other hand, transgenic mice over-expressing hepcidin exhibited increased mortality within a few hours after birth due to severe iron deficiency anemia (Nicolas, G., Bennoun, M., Porteu, A., Mativet, S., Beaumont, C, Grandchamp, B., Sirito, M., Sawadogo, M., Kahn, A., Vaulont, S. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 99, 4596-601). The molecular mechanism of hepcidin action was elucidated recently when it was found that hepcidin binds to ferroportin, the only known cell iron exporter (Donovan, A., Lima, C.A., Pinkus, J. L., Pinkus, G. S., Zon, L. I., Robine, S., Andrews, N. C. (2005) Cell Metab. 1 , 191-200), and induces its internalization and degradation in the cytoplasm (Nemeth, E., Turtle, M.S., Powelson, J., Vaughn, M. B., Donovan, A., Ward, D. M. Ganz, T., Kaplan, J. (2004) Science 306, 2090-3). Ferroportin is expressed in hepatocytes, macrophages and enterocytes (Donovan, A., Lima, C.A., Pinkus, J. L., Pinkus, G. S., Zon, L. I., Robine, S., Andrews, N. C. (2005) Cell Metab. 1 , 191-200). High levels of hepcidin decrease ferroportin expression, thereby inhibiting dietary iron absorption, release of recycled iron from macrophages and mobilization of iron stores from the liver. Several studies have shown the key role of hepcidin in the control of iron homeostasis. Mutations in hepcidin have been implicated in patients with juvenile hemochromatosis (JH) (Roetto, A., Daraio, F., Porporato, P., Caruso, R., Cox, T. M., Cazzola, M., Gasparini, P, Piperno, A., Camaschella, C. (2004) Blood 103, 2407-9 and Roetto, A., Papanikolaou, G., Politou, M., Alberti, F., Girelli, D., Christakis, J., Loukopoulos, D., Camaschella, C. (2003) Nat. Genet. 33, 21-2). Moreover, other types of hereditary hemochromatosis, caused by mutations of HFE, TFR2, or HJV genes are also associated with abnormalities in hepcidin expression (Bridle, K. R., Frazer, D. M., Wilkins, S.J., Dixon, J. L., Purdie, D. M., Crawford, D. H., Subramaniam, V.N. , Powell, LW., Anderson, G.J., Ramm, G. A. (2003) Lancet 361 ,669-73; Nemeth, E., Roetto, A., Garozzo, G., Ganz, T., Camaschella, C. (2005) Blood 105, 1803-6 and Babitt, J. L., Huang, F.W., Wrighting, D.M., Xia, Y., Sidis, Y., Samad, T. A., Campagna, J. A., Chung, R. T., Scheyer, A. L., Woolf, C. J., Andrews, N. C, Lin, H. Y. (2006) Nat. Genet 38, 531 -9). \n\n In chronic inflammatory conditions, hepcidin's upregulation contributes to the anemia of chronic disease (Nemeth, E., Valore, E. V., Territo, M., Schiller, G., Lichtenstein, A, Ganz, T. (2003) Blood 101 ,2461-3; Nemeth, E., Rivera, S., Gabayan, V., Kellre, C, Taudorf, S., Pedersen, B.K., Ganz, T. (2004) J. Clin. Invest. 113, 1271- 6 and Nicolas, G., Chauvet, C, Viatte, L\n1\n Danan, J. L, Bigard, X., Devaux, I., Beaumont, C\n1\n Kahn, A., Vaulont, S. (2002) J. CHn. Invest. 110,1037-44).\n\n\nBecause of its profound biomedical significance hepcidin has become the target of intense biochemical studies. However, such studies are hindered by the limited availability of functional peptide. Chemically synthesized hepcidin is commercially available; however, this material is in most cases inactive in biological assays. Isolation of hepcidin from urine has proven to be difficult due to its low concentration. The development of a heterologous system for large-scale production of biologically active hepcidin would be an important step. To date, different approaches have been used to express recombinant hepcidin in E. coli. First, hepcidin was expressed as a 10.5 kDa fusion protein (His-hepcidin) in inclusion bodies, purified in denatured form, refolded, cleaved by enterokinase and further purified by reverse-phase chromatography (Zhang, H., Yuan, Q., Zhu, Y., Ma, R., (2005) Protein Expr. Purif. 41 , 409-16). This peptide exhibited antibacterial activity. In a second approach, hepcidin-20 was cloned as a fusion protein to the C-terminus of GST, or mouse H ferritin, or by inserting it in the middle of the loop between helices D and E of ferritin (Gerardi, G., Biasiotto, G., Santambrogio, P., Zanella, I., Ingrassia, R., Corrado, M. Cavadini, P., Derosas, M., Levi, S., Arosio, P. (2005) Blood Cells MoI. Dis. 35, 177-81). These chimerical proteins were isolated in association with iron and did not recapitulate the biological function of hepcidin. Finally, Myc-His tagged human hepcidin was expressed in HEK-293 cells. The recombinant peptide was processed and secreted correctly and was biologically active in antimicrobial assays (Wallace, D. F., Jones, M. D., Pedersen, P., Rivas, L., Sly, L. I., Subramaniam, V. N. (2006) Biochimie 88, 31-7). However, no functional assays, of the above recombinant preparations in regulating iron metabolism are described. Moreover, based on the key role of hepcidin in iron homeostasis and the pathogenesis of iron disorders it is obvious that an easy assay for its measurement in blood or urine would prove extremely useful for the diagnosis of patients with hemochromatosis or anemia of chronic disease. Currently, the concentration of urinary hepcidin is measured using an immuno-dot assay (Nemeth, E., Rivera, S., \n\n Gabayan, V , Kellre, C , Taudorf, S , Pedersen, B K , Ganz, T (2004) J CIm Invest 113, 1271-6), SDS-PAGE and Western Blot (Nemeth, E , Valore, E V , Territo, M , Schiller, G , Lichtenstein, A, Ganz, T (2003) Blood 101 ,2461-3), or a SELDI-TOF-MS (Kemna, E , Tjalsma, H., Laarakkers, C, Nemeth, E., Williams, H., and Swinkels, D. (2005) Blood 106, 3268-3270) Recently, two reports described the use of SELDI- TOF-MS to determine hepcidin concentration in human plasma and serum (Tomosugi, N., Kawabata, H., Wakatabe, R , Higuchi, M , Yamaya, H., Umehera, H., Ishikawa, I (2006) Blood 108, 1381-7 and Kemna, E , Tjalsma, H , Podust, V., and Swinkels, D (2007) CIm Chem 53, 1-9), whereas according to another report, active human and mouse hepcidin in serum was determined using LC/MS/MS, at the quantitative range of 1 to 500 ng/mL serum for normal human hepcidin (Murphy, A. T., Witcher, D. R., Luan, P., and Wroblewski, V. J. (2007) Blood 110, 1048-54)\n\n\nDespite the utility of these methods for research purposes, the advanced technology of mass spectrometry is not widely accessible for clinical use. The only immunoassay method described so far measures pro-hepcidin, the 84 amino acid precursor of the active hepcidin peptide, and is based on the assumption that serum hepcidin concentrations would be directly correlated to measured pro-hepcidin concentrations (Hadley, K B , Johnson, L K , and Hunt, J R (2006) Am J Clin Nυtr. 84, 150-155). However, according to another study using the pro-hepcidin ELISA, serum pro-hepcidin levels do not correlate with urinary hepcidin levels after LPS injection, rendering doubtful the utility of pro-hepcidin measurement for diagnosis (Kemna, E., Pickkers, P , Nemeth, E., van der Hoeven, H., and Swinkels, D (2005) Blood 106, 1864-1866)\n\n\nIn the light of the above, it is evident that there is a need to provide a process which can produce functional recombinant hepcidin in sufficient quantities for advanced research or clinical use and/or the need to provide an assay that can reliably measure the amount of hepcidin in a biological sample, that is, for diagnostic purposes\n\n\nIt is the aim of the present invention to provide such a process and/or an assay\n\n\nIn a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for producing biologically functional hepcidin or a biologically functional hepcidin derivative, the method including the step of exogenously expressing hepcidin or a \n\n derivative within an expression system characterized in that the expression system is a eukaryotic methylotropic yeast, preferably Pichia pastoris (P. pastoήs).\n\n\nIn a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for producing biologically functional hepcidin or a biologically functional hepcidin derivative, the method including the step of expressing hepcidin or derivative within an expression system, wherein the hepcidin or derivative is provided with at least one tag at the C-terminal region.\n\n\nAs will be seen by way of reference to the experimental protocols and attached figures below, the present inventors have provided the first successful heterologous expression of a recombinant biologically functional hepcidin or biologically functional derivative of hepcidin. By biologically functional, it is to be understood that the hepcidin and hepcidin derivative are both bactericidal and have the ability to control cellular iron metabolism. It will be appreciated that by comparison with previous attempts to produce recombinant hepcidin, the present method or process has the advantage of soluble expression and high yield without the need of any renaturation process (Zhang, H., Yuan, Q., Zhu, Y., Ma, R., (2005) Protein Expr. Purif. 41 , 409-16 and Wallace, D.F., Jones, M. D., Pedersen, P., Rivas, L., Sly, L. I., Subramaniam, V. N. (2006) Biochimie 88, 31-7). More importantly, the resulting hepcidins and derivatives are functional not only as antimicrobial peptides but also, or mainly, as a regulator of cellular iron metabolism i.e. they are biologically functional.\n\n\nIt is to be understood that the word \"hepcidin\" or abbreviation \"Hep\" as used herein, and unless otherwise specified, covers both human hepcidin-20 and hepcidin- 25, namely, the two predominant mature forms of the human hormone hepcidin, which are 20 and 25 amino acid residues long, respectively and hepcidin derivatives. In this respect, human hepcidin-20 is designated herein as Hep20 and has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 and human hepcindin-25 is designated herein as Hep25 and has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO.2. The word \"derivative\" as used herein, and unless otherwise specified, includes both the 20 and 25 amino acid residues of human hepcidin-20 and hepcidin-25 with one or more additional amino acids positioned at the N terminus. It is also to be understood that unless otherwise specified, the word \"hepcidin\" or abbreviation \"Hep\" or \"derivative\" is not limited to human hepcidin, including human Hep-20 and Hep-25. \n\n Preferably, the derivative is hepcidin-20 or hepcidin-25 with two additional amino acids positioned at the N terminus. In a preferred embodiment, the derivative is hepcidin-20 with additional amino acids glycine and alanine at the N terminal; this derivative is designated herein as hepcidin-20d and has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3. In a further preferred embodiment, the derivative is hepcidin-25 with additional amino acids glycine and alanine at the N terminal; this derivative is designated herein as hepcidin-25d and has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 4.\n\n\nPreferably, the tag is a polyhistidine tag. As will be appreciated, a polyhistidine tag is an amino acid motif that consists of at least six histidines (His). A polyhistidine tag is also known as a hexa-histidine tag, a 6xHis-tag and by the trade marked name, His-tag®. It is to be understood that unless otherwise stated, the abbreviation \"His\" used throughout means a polyhistidine tag.\n\n\nFurther preferably, the tag is a myc-His-tag. As stated above, the designation \"His\", unless otherwise stated, means a polyhistidine tag. The designation of \"myc\" is a c-myc epitope.\n\n\nIt is to be understood that the tag is provided directly or indirectly with the C terminal of the hepcidin or a hepcidin derivative. When provided directly, the tag is positioned consecutive to the terminal amino acid of hepcidin-20 and hepcidin-25 or a hepcidin derivative. The tag may be provided indirectly via a linker.\n\n\nPreferably, the linker is one or more amino acids positioned consecutive to the terminal amino acid of hepcidin-20 and hepcidin-25 or a hepcidin derivative. More preferably the linker is two amino acids long and, even more preferably; the amino acids are phenylalanine and aspartic acid. Alternatively, the linker is one or more amino acid substitutions of the terminal amino acids of hepcidin-20, hepcidin-25 or a hepcidin derivative. More preferably, the linker is a single amino acid substitution of the terminal amino acid of hepcidin-20, hepcidin-25 or a hepcidin derivative and, even more preferably, the terminal amino acid threonine is substituted with leucine. Advantageously, the His tag is provided to the hepcidin-20 or hepcidin-25 with a linker of phenylalanine and aspartic acid. More advantageously, the myc-His tag is provided to the hepcidin-20 or hepcidin-25 with a linker of leucine that has substituted the terminal amino acid threonine. \n\n In a preferred embodiment, the His tag is provided to a derivative of hepcidin-\n\n\n20 having glycine and alanine positioned at the N terminal with a linker of phenylalanine and aspartic acid; this tagged biologically functional hepcidin derivative is designated herein as hepcidin-20His (Hep-20His) and has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 5.\n\n\nIn a further preferred embodiment, the His tag is provided to a derivative of hepcidin-25 having glycine and alanine positioned at the N terminal with a linker of phenylalanine and aspartic acid; this tagged biologically functional hepcidin derivative is designated herein as hepcidin-25His (Hep-25His) and has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6.\n\n\nIn a further preferred embodiment, the myc-His tag is provided to a derivative of hepcidin-20 having glycine and alanine positioned at the N terminal with a linker of leucine that substitutes the terminal amino acid threonine; this tagged biologically functional hepcidin derivative is designated herein as hepcidin-20MycHis (Hep- 20MycHis) and has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 7.\n\n\nIn a further preferred embodiment, the myc-His tag is provided to a derivative of hepcidin-25 having glycine and alanine positioned at the N terminal with a linker of leucine that substitutes the terminal amino acid threonine; this tagged biologically functional hepcidin derivative is designated herein as hepcidin-25MycHis (Hep- 25MycHis) and has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 8.\n\n\nAdvantageously, the tagged biologically functional hepcidin or a tagged biologically functional hepcidin derivative is exogenously expressed within an expression system, wherein the expression system is a eukaryotic methylotropic yeast, preferably Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris). With reference to the results given below, it will be appreciated that the expression system of the eukaryotic methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris is particularly advantageous due to its ability to produce extracellular soluble proteins, eukaryotic post-translational modifications (such as disulfide bond forming). It is also easy to handle, and has a high yield of production. Preferably, and prior to expression of hepcidin or a hepcidin derivative, the methods of the present invention include the step of introducing a vector including a hepcidin encoding polynucleotide insert into the expression system, preferably a eukaryotic methylotropic yeast expression system, preferably Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris). \n\n As used herein, it is to be understood that a hepcidin encoding polynucleotide insert is a polynucleotide which can encode a hepcidin, including human hepcidin-20 and -25 (human Hep20 and Hep25) having the sequence of SEQ ID NOs. 1 and 2 respectively, or a hepcidin derivative, including hepcidin-20d and hepcidin-25d having the sequences of SEQ ID NOs. 3 and 4 respectively. The hepcidin encoding polynucleotide insert also includes a polynucleotide which can encode tagged hepcidin or a tagged hepcidin derivative, including the preferred tags, namely, Myc and 6xHis; and/or the linkers, namely, phenylalanine and aspartic acid or a single leucine amino acid substitution of the terminal amino acid of hepcidin-20 and -25; including hepcidin-20His having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 5, hepcidin-25His having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6, hepcidin-20MycHis having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 7 and hepcidin-25MycHis having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 8.\n\n\nA skilled person will appreciate that the vector may be any suitable vector. For example, the vector may be pPICZaA, pPICZaB or pPICZaC (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The vector can encode the preferred tags, namely, Myc and 6xHis; and/or the linkers, namely, phenylalanine and aspartic acid or a single leucine amino acid substitution of the terminal amino acid of hepcidin-20 and -25.\n\n\nAdvantageously, the hepcidin encoding polynucleotide insert is provided with a Fokl restriction site. The unique Fokl restriction site of the insert in combination with the restriction sites from the vector enables the construction of Hep-25MycHis, Hep- 20MycHis, Hep-25His and Hep-20His plasmids, which permitted the expression of hepcidin-25 and hepcidin-20 and hepcidin derivatives fused to c-MycHis or His epitope alone.\n\n\nPreferably, a hepcidin encoding polynucleotide insert encodes human hepcidin-25d and the method further includes the step of obtaining the hepcidin-25d encoding insert by PCR amplification of the product obtained by the extension of the overlapping oligonucleotides designated herein as ForHep25 and RevHep; the sequences of which are shown in Figure 1. Further preferably, PCR amplification is carried out using the primers designated herein as ForXhol and RevNotl; the sequences of which are shown in Figure 1.\n\n\nAdvantageously, the hepcidin encoding polynucleotide insert encodes human hepcidin-20d, and the method includes the step of carrying out PCR amplification on the resulting vector, preferably using the primers designated herein as Forhep20 (5- \n\n GCGAGTGCATCGACGGCGCCATATGCATCTTCTGCTG-S) and the RevNotl, the sequence of which is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\nPreferably, the methods of the present invention further include the step of purifying the expressed hepcidin. In a preferred embodiment, the step of purifying comprises a two stage purification process. Advantageously the first stage of the purification process comprises metal affinity chromatography. Preferably, the metal is nickel, colbalt or nickel coordinated with NTA (nitilotriacetic acid). In a preferred embodiment the second stage of the purification process comprises gel filtration chromatography. Advantageously, a sepharose or superdex™ peptide column is used.\n\n\nFurther preferably, the expressed hepcidin is human hepcidin, preferably selected from the group consisting of hepcidin-20 having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 , hepcidin-25 having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 2, hepcidin-20d having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3, hepcidin-25d having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 4, hepcidin-20His having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 5, hepcidin-25His having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6, hepcidin-20MycHis having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 7 and hepcidin-25MycHis having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 8.\n\n\nIn a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a hepcidin obtainable by carrying out the method(s) of the present invention. Advantageously, the hepcidin is human hepcidin-25His having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6. With reference to the protocols below, human hepcidin-25His (Hep- 25His) was unequivocally the most functional. It exhibited the maximum bactericidal activity against E.coli strain ML35, very similar to natural hepcidin25, isolated from urine or synthetic hepcidin. According to Park, C. H., Valore, E. V., Waring, A. J., Ganz, T. (2001 ) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 7806-10, 1000-fold reduction of surviving bacteria ML35p was achieved at 30μM concentration of both hep25 and hep20. Hep- 25His also reduced 1000-fold the number of surviving bacteria at 30μM. Furthermore, the Hep-25His peptide was also able to elicit a decrease in ferroportin levels by ~50% in target RAW 264.7 macrophages. This effect was apparently due to the internalization and degradation of the transporter ferropotin (FPN1 ). This mechanism of action was tested in the HEK293-Fpn stable cell line and showed that treatment with the recombinant peptide Hep25-His causes the internalization of FPN1-GFP, by analogy to the synthetic hepcidin, Hep25 (Nemeth, E., Turtle, M.S., Powelson, J., \n\n Vaughn, M. B., Donovan, A., Ward, D.M. Ganz, T., Kaplan, J. (2004) Science 306, 2090-3). The concomitant Hep-25His-mediated decrease in TfR1 expression by ~50% is consistent with a homeostatic response to intracellular iron accumulation, which is predicted in cells expressing fewer iron exporting molecules. The retention of iron within Hep-25His-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages is demonstrated by the increase in LIP levels. The data with the negative peptide of 4.8 kDa, produced in P. pastoris by the vector alone and bearing a Myc-His tag, indicate the specificity of this response. Moreover we demonstrate that the recombinant peptide can specifically bind to its receptor (ferroportin) by a cross-linking and pull-down assay. According to the results given below it is clear that Hep-25His, having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6, is a very good analogue of hepcidin-25, mimicking its behaviour. It is expressed in high quantity that can be further increased with scaling up to fermentation. In comparison with previous attempts to produce recombinant hepcidin, our system offers the advantage of soluble expression at high yield and without the need of any renaturation procedure (Zhang, H., Yuan, Q., Zhu, Y., Ma, R., (2005) Protein Expr. Purif. 41 , 409-16 and Wallace, D.F., Jones, M. D., Pedersen, P., Rivas, L., Sly, L I., Subramaniam, V. N. (2006) Biochimie 88, 31-7).

The resulting PCR product was subsequently inserted into Xhol-Notl sites of pPICZaC vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) so that the recombinant peptide is led to soluble expression by a leader peptide a-factor under the transcriptional control of the AOX promoter. The cloned Hep-25-pPICZaC vector was used as a template for the PCR amplification of hepcidin-20 (60bp) using the specific upstream primer. Forhep20 (5- GCGAGTGCATCGACGGCGCCATATGCATCTTCTGCTG-S) and the previously described RevHeplong primer.\n\n\nBoth constructs carried a stop codon just before the c-myc and 6xHis epitope of the pPICZaC vector to allow expression of hepcidins without tags. The resulting recombinant plasmids, Hep-25 and Hep-20, were subjected to proper enzymatic modifications in order to produce the tagged constructs. The unique Fokl restriction site of the insert in combination with the Xbal and Sail restriction sites from the vector were used for the construction of Hep-25MycHis, Hep-20MycHis, Hep-25His and Hep-20His plasmids, which permitted the expression of hepcidin-20 (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 ), hepcidin-25 (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 2), hepcidin-20d (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3) and hepcidin-25d (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 4) fused to c-MycHis or His epitope alone (including the \n\n tagged hepcidin and tagged hepcidin derivatives having the sequences of SEQ ID NOs. 5 to 8).\n\n\nAll DNA manipulations were performed as described (Sambrook J., Maniatis T., Fritsch E. F., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, second ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989.) and all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.\n\n\nAll recombinant plasmids were linearized using Pmel restriction enzyme and transformed into strain X33 of P. pastoris (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) by electroporation (Biorad, Hercules, CA). Selection was achieved on YPD (1 % yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) agar plates containing 100μg/ml Zeocin\n\n\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) after 3 days of incubation at 30\n0\nC.\n\n\nExpression in P. pastoris - Several individual clones from each electroporation were incubated in 2ml BMGY (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.0, 1.34% YNB, 4 x 10\n5\n% biotin and 1% Glycerol) for 16h at 30\n0\nC, and then the cells were resuspended in 2 ml BMMY (0.5% Methanol instead of glycerol) to induce expression.\n\n\nAfter induction for 5 days with daily addition of methanol (0.5% v/v), the culture supernatants were tested for expression of hepcidin by dot blot analysis using a polyclonal anti-Hepcidin antibody (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX) for the untagged peptides and a mAb anti-His (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) or anti-Myc 9E.10 mAb (ATCC) for the tagged ones. The clones with the highest yield were used for large scale expression. In all subsequent preparations, cells were harvested at 36h of methanol induction.\n\n\nPurification and analysis of peptides - Culture supernatants were filtered through a 0.22μm filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA), concentrated and dialyzed against\n\n\n5OmM sodium phosphate buffer, 15OmM NaCL, with TFF Prep scale Ultrafiltration system equipped with IkDa filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The untagged hepcidins were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography performed on a Sephadex G-10 column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), as previously described (Tomosugi, N., Kawabata, H., Wakatabe, R., Higuchi, M., Yamaya, H., Umehera, H.,\n\n\nIshikawa, I. (2006) Blood 108, 1381-7). First-step purification of the 6xHIS containing peptides was performed with Ni-NTA metal affinity chromatography according to manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Elution was performed under \n\n rv_ I / uι\\£uuo; UUUUJU\n\n\n19 native conditions with 5OmM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0, 15OmM NaCI, 25OmM Imidazole. The eluates were concentrated through lyophilization and subjected to size exclusion chromatography with a Peptide Superdex column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), specific for the separation of peptides 100 - 7000 Da, according to the manufacturer's instructions, for the isolation of hepcidin monomers. All size exclusion chromatography analysis was performed on an FPLC AKTA system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Peptides were subjected to electrophoresis on 4-12% NuPAGE Novex Bis/Tris gels under non reducing conditions according to manufacture's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) followed by Coomasie Brilliant Blue staining. Western blot of the tagged hepcidins was performed using an XCeII Il blot module according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) with 0.1 μm pore size was used for transfer of the peptides followed by probing with anti-His MAb, in a dilution of 1 :1000. Anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with HRP (in a dilution of 1:5000) was purchased by DakoCytomation (Carpinteria, CA). Quantification of purified hepcidins was performed with a fluorescent quantification system (Quant-It, Qubit), according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Synthetic hepcidin25 used as control was purchased from Peptides International (Louisville, KY). Antimicrobial assay - All purified recombinant hepcidins were tested for antibacterial activity against E. coli ML35 and BL21 (DE) is a CFU assay (Porter E. M., van Dam E., Valore E.V., Ganz T., Broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of human intestinal defensin 5, Infect. Immun. 65 (1997) 2396-2401.). Bacterial cell cultures were grown to ODβoo\n=\n0.2 (5x10\n7\n cfu/ml) and resuspended to a final concentration of 10\n6\n cfu/ml in 2OmM sodium phosphate buffer, pH7.4. Various concentrations of peptides were added to a final volume of 100μl and after incubation for 2h at 37\n0\nC, surviving cells were plated in triplicates to LB/agar plates.\n\n\nCell lines - THP-1 human and J774 murine monocytic cell lines were maintained in RPMI with 10% FBS, 2 mM 1-glutamine, and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin solution at 37°C and 5% CO\n2\n RAW 264.7 murine monocytic cell line and EcR293T transfected cells (kindly provided by Dr. Kaplan) (Nemeth, E., Tuttle, M.S., Powelson, J., Vaughn, M. B., Donovan, A., Ward, D. M. Ganz, T., Kaplan, J. (2004) Science 306, 2090-3), were maintained in DMEM (Gibco, USA) \n\n supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution at 37°C and 5% CO\n2\n 400μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 400μg/ml geneticin (Gibco, USA) were added to the stably transfected EcR293T cell line, in order to maintain selection of transfected Ferroportin-GFP under an ecdysone promoter. Addition of 10μM ponasterone (Sigma Chem, St Louis, MA) induced expression of ferroportin-GFP [10].\n\n\nWestern blotting - 1x10\n6\n cells (RAW 264.7, THP-1 or J774) were plated in 6- well plates and after 12-2Oh cells were treated with hepcidins in serum-free DMEM for 4h, at 37\n0\nC. Afterwards, cells were re-suspended in lysis buffer (1 % Triton, 25mM Hepes pH 7.4, 15OmM NaCI, 10% Glycerol, 5mM EDTA, 0.5mM PMSF, protein inhibitors (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and quantified by Bradford assay (Biorad, Hercules, CA). 30μg of cell lysate was analyzed on 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Hybond C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and the membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies rabbit anti-ferroportin (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX), mouse anti-TfR1 (Zymed, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and mouse anti-β actin (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA), in a dilution of 1 :1000, overnight at 4°C. After washing, the membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP, in a dilution of 1 :5000 (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA), for 1 h at room temperature. Specific signal was detected with a chemiluminescence assay kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The bands were quantified by densitometry using the Quantity-One (Biorad, Hercules, CA) software. Data are shown as means±SD. Statistical analysis was performed by student t-Test.\n\n\nLIP assay - The fluorescent metalosensor calcein (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used for the measurement of alterations in the levels of the LIP (Labile Iron Pool) (Murphy, A. T., Witcher, D. R., Luan, P., and Wroblewski, V. J. (2007) Blood 110, 1048-54). 1x10\n6\n RAW 264.7 macrophages were plated in 6-well plates. After 16 h of incubation, recombinant hepcidin was added at 10μM in serum-free DMEM for 4h at 37°C, and then 0.25μM calcein was added for 30min at 25°C. Unbound calcein was washed away and cells were resuspended in cold PBS. Fluorescence was measured with the Perkin Elmer LS55 fluorescent plate reader (Perkin Elmer LifeSciences, Boston MA) (488nm excitation, 517nm emission). Quenching of extracellular calcein was achieved by the addition of 100μM DFO. Intracellular \n\n calcein-bound iron was released upon addition of the fast-permeating iron chelator SIH (isonicotinyl hydrazone salicylaldehyde) at 100μM. Relative changes were expressed as percentage of the control.\n\n\nCross-linking and pull-down assay - Raw 264.7 cells were resuspended in ice- cold PBS at 2x107 cells/ml and Hep25-His, negative peptide or PBS were added at a final concentration of 10 mM for 1 h at 4 C. Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS, Pierce, Rockford, IL) was added for 20 min at room temperature, followed by quenching with 20 mM TriseHCI pH 7.4 for 20 min. Protein lysate was extracted as described above and incubated with Ni2-NTA agarose overnight at 4 _C. Bound proteins were eluted with 1 M imidazole and analyzed by Western blot using anti-FPN1 antibody as described above.\n\n\nImmunization - A rabbit was immunized subcutaneously with 100 μg of Hep- 25His dissolved in 0.4 ml of PBS and emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma Chem, St Louis, MO). The immunization protocol included 3 boost immunizations of one injection each where 100 μg of Hep-25His having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6 was dissolved in 0.4 ml of PBS and emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma Chem, St Louis, MA). A sample of pre-immune serum was taken from the ear vein before the first injection. The test bleeding was carried out 10 days after the last boost immunization from the ear vain. The serum was tested for antibody activity with ELISA assay.\n\n\nAntibody purification - 1 mg of 6xHis synthetic peptide (Covance, Princeton, NJ) or 0.5 mg of Hep-25His peptide having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6 were coupled to CNBr-activated sepharose at 0.1 M NaHCO\n3\n, pH 8.4, 0.5M NaCI, according to manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Polyclonal antiserum against Hep-25His peptide having the sequence of SEQ\n\n\nID NO. 6 was subjected to 33% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation (Herbert, G. A., P. L. Pelham, and Pittman, B. (1973) Appl. Microbiol. 25, 26-36) and dialyzed against 5OmM sodium phosphate buffer, 15OmM Nad. Afterwards, the serum was incubated overnight at 4\n0\nC with 6xHis-coupled sepharose beads and then, the supernatant was retained, while the column was regenerated by washing twice with 0.2 N HCI-glycine, pH 2.8 and neutralized with 1 M K\n2\nHPO\n4\n. Finally the column was washed with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCI and stored at 4°C in PBS, 0.02% azide. The above purification procedure was repeated 5 times. The \n\n resulting purified serum was further purified by incubation with Hep-25His-coupled sepharose column, overnight at 4°C. The next day, after washing the column twice with PBS, the specific anti-Hep25 antibodies were eluted with an equal volume of 0.2N HCI-glycine pH 2.7 and neutralized with 1 M Tris pH 9, 5 M NaCI. lmmunohistochemistry - In order to determine if the antibodies against hepcidin25-His could also identify native hepcidin we performed immunohistochemical analysis on normal mice liver tissues . Tissues were deparaffinized two times in xylene for 5 min and dehydrated in dilutions of ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%) for 2 min each. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min, followed by immersion in tap water for 5 min. Antigen retrieval was accomplished by immersing and heating the slides in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0 three times in a microwave, for 5 min each, after which they were allowed to cool to room temperature for 20 min. The slides were then incubated in blocking solution (3% FBS, 1%BSA, 0.05% Tween in TBS) for 30 min, followed by incubation with purified primary antibody (10mg/ml) at 4\n0\nC for 16 h. After that they were then incubated with secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with HRP (diluted 1 :100 in blocking buffer) (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) for 1 h. Visualization of the stain was accomplished after addition of 3,3' diaminobenzidine substrate (Sigma, St Louis, MO) for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by washing with tap water and slides were counterstained with Hematoxylin (Sigma, St Louis, MO) for 1min. They were then dehydrated in a 70%, 95% and 100% ethanol series for 2 min each, cleared by immersing in xylene twice for 5 min each, and mounted in DPX (Sigma, St Louis, MO). Secondary antibody alone was used as negative control. In addition, competition experiments were performed by pre-incubating overnight at 4\n0\nC the polyclonal antibody with Hep25-His peptide (1 mg/ml).\n\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) - Microtiter plates (96-well) (Costar, Corning, NY) were coated overnight at 4°C with 50 μl of Hep-25His (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6), 6xHis or BSA (0.5 μg/ml) in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.6). Plates were washed and non-specific binding sites were blocked with blocking buffer (PBS containing 3% BSA) for 1 h at 37°C. Antiserum (diluted 1:3000 in PBS, 3% BSA) was added to each well, and the wells were incubated for 1 h at 37\n0\nC. For competition experiments, purified antiserum (diluted 1 :3000 in PBS, 3% BSA) was overnight incubated with 8 μl of each human serum \n\n per well or various known concentrations of Hep-25His peptide (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6) at 4°C and next day, the complexes were added to wells and incubated for 1 h at 37°C, as well. Unbound antibody was removed by washing 10 times with PBST and plates were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (diluted 1 :2000 in PBS, 3% BSA) (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were washed as before and visualization of the signal was accomplished after addition of 3,3', 5,5' tetramethylbenzidin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped after the addition of 0.2 N sulphuric acid and color development was measured photometrically at 450nm with a microplate reader (Bio-rad Model 680). All experiments were performed in quadruplicates.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nSoluble expression and purification of recombinant heocidins in yeast P.pastoris - Three different constructions were performed sequentially for recombinant soluble expression of hepcidin-20 and 25, in methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris: a) without tag peptide (Hep-20 and Hep-25 having the sequences of SEQ ID NOs. 1 and 2 respectively), b) with myc-His tags (Hep-20MycHis and Hep- 25MycHis (having the sequences of SEQ ID NOs. 7 and 8 respectively) and c) with His tag (Hep-20His and Hep-25His having the sequences of SEQ ID NOs. 5 and 6 respectively), at the 3' end of the hepcidin sequences (Figure 1). For each construct, several clones were induced by methanol for three days and culture supernatants were analyzed for hepcidin expression by dot blot immunoassay. The highest expressing clones were selected for large scale production. The recombinant peptides were harvested from culture supernatants, concentrated and dialyzed by an ultrafiltration system (filter cut off 1 KDa), and the untagged and tagged peptides were purified by size-exclusion or Ni\n2\n-NTA metal affinity chromatography, respectively. In brief, no positive clones expressing the Hep-20His peptide were detected, whereas the yield of purified untagged hepcidin-20 and -25 was less than 20μg/l. The low yield of the purified untagged peptides, that was approximately 20ng per litre of culture, appears to be due to difficulties of purification and detection and not to their potentially toxicity of the expressing peptide. In contrast, the yield of Hep- 25MycHis, Hep-20MycHis and Hep-25His tag peptides was approximately 5-7 mg/l of culture. Purified tagged products were analyzed on 4-12% NuPAGE gel and \n\n Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Figure 2A). The molecular weight of Hep-25His is estimated at 4 kDa, of Hep-25MycHis at 5.2 kDa and of Hep-20MycHis at 4.8 kDa. The eluted peptides contained several higher molecular weight bands, which corresponded to oligomeric forms as confirmed by Western blot using the anti-myc or anti-His mAbs (Figure 2B). In order to further purify the tagged hepcidins, FPLC size- exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex peptide column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) (Figure 3). The resulting fractions corresponding to the molecular weight of interest were analyzed on a 4-12% Nu- PAGE gel (Figure 4). The peptides migrated as monomers with a molecular mass consistent with that predicted from their amino acid sequence. The yield of the purified recombinant tagged hepcidin monomers was 0.5-1 mg/l of culture.\n\n\nAntimicrobial activity of recombinant hepcidins - The colony forming unit assay ( E. M. Porter, E. van Dam, E.V. Valore, T. Ganz, Broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of human intestinal defensin 5, Infect. Immun. 65 (1997) 2396-2401) was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of the purified recombinant hepcidin forms against the E. coli strain, ML35. The E. coli BL21 (DE) strain, which is resistant to hepcidin, was used as the negative control. Surviving microbes were counted following incubation with various concentrations of recombinant hepcidin preparations, synthetic hepcidin or negative peptide for 2 h at 37 C. Recombinant untagged Hepcidin-20 (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1) was bactericidal at concentrations higher than 10 mM, while Hepcidin-25 (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 2) could not be tested because it was produced in insufficient amounts (data not shown). From the tagged forms (Fig. 3), recombinant Hep25-His (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6) presented the highest antibacterial activity (IC 50 = 15 mM), whereas the Myc epitope containing peptide Hep25-MycHis (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 8) was less effective (IC 50 = 58.6 mM), presumably due to significant alterations of its conformation. The antibacterial activity of Hep25-His (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6) was comparable with that of the synthetic hepcidin 25 (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 2) (IC 50 = 9 mM) as shown in Fig. 3. None of them had any effect on the hepcidin resistant E. coli BL21(DE) strain. Iron is accumulated in the RAWm 264.7 macrophages after treatment with recombinant hepcidin - The changes of cellular iron homeostasis after treatment with the recombinant hepcidins were also studied by Labile Iron Pool (LIP) assays (Konijn A.M.,Glickstein H., Vaisman B., Meyron-Holtz E.G., Slotki I.N., Cabantchik Z.I, (1999) \n\n Blood 94, 2128-34). RAWm 264.7 macrophages were treated with the different forms of recombinant tagged hepcidin at 10μM, for 4h at 37\n0\nC. FAC (30μg/ml) was used as positive control and LIP was increased 3-fold (± 0.2) (p<0.001) in comparison to untreated cells (Figure 6). In the presence of Hep-25His (peptide having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6), LIP was increased approximately 2.5 fold (± 0.21) (p<0.001), whereas Hep-25MycHis (peptide having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 8) induced an increase of LIP of approximately 2-fold (±0.44) (p<0.05) (Figure 7). Hep-20MycHis (peptide having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 7) showed a lower effect on LIP, 1.85 fold (±0.52) (p<0.05). Hep25-His showed the most significant and consistent change in the LIP assay, while the Myc-containing peptides and great variance between experiments.\n\n\nRecombinant hepcidins downrepulate ferroportin and Tf R1 in macrophages - The effect of recombinant hepcidins on cellular iron metabolism was tested in macrophage cells lines by measuring the expression levels of ferroportin (FPN1) and TfR1. RAW 264.7 cells were treated with 1μM and 10μM of hepcidin25 (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 2) and Hep-25His (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6), the most active peptide in antibacterial assays and in LIP assays, for 4h at 37°C and the expression of FPN 1 and TfR 1 was detected in cell lysates by Western Blot analysis (Figure 7). In comparison to untreated cells, Hep-25His at a concentration of 1μM was able to reduce FPN 1 by 37% ± 7, whereas at a concentration of 10μM it reduced both TfR1 and FPN1 by 48% ± 17.7 and 48 ± 3, respectively (Figure 7A, B). The synthetic peptide caused an inhibition of TfR1 by 37%± 6 and of FPN1 by 36%± 10.6 at 10μM. Higher concentrations of the recombinant peptide did not have a stronger effect (data not shown). The oligomeric fraction of Hep25-His was also tested and no effect was found on cellular iron metabolism (data not shown) . Similar results were obtained when human THP-1 and murine J774 monocytic cells were treated with the recombinant peptides (data not shown). These results suggest that recombinant hepcidin can bind to FPN1 and induce its internalization and degradation (Nemeth, E., Tuttle, M.S., Powelson, J., Vaughn, M. B., Donovan, A., Ward, D.M. Ganz, T., Kaplan, J. (2004) Science 306, 2090-3), whereas Tf R1 expression is reduced in order to minimize iron uptake.\n\n\nHep25-His acts by binding to ferroportin and causing its subsequent internalisation. The specific binding oh Hep25-His (having the sequence of SEQ ID \n\n NO. 6) to FPN 1 was studied by a cross-linking and pull-down assay. RAW 264.7 were treated with He25-His (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6) or negative peptide (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 9) at 1OnM, followed with cross-linking with DSS and pull-down using Ni\n2\n-NTA agarose. Protein complex eluted from Ni\n2\n- NTA was subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-ferroportin antibody. As shown in Fig. 7C, FPN1 was co-purified with Hep25-His after cross-linking and pulldown assay, thus suggesting that the recombinant Hep25-His peptide binds specifically to FPN1. Furthermore, the internalization of FPN1 in the presence of Hep25-His (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6) was analyzed in HEK293-Fpn cells by confocal microscopy; these cells express an FPN 1 -GFP fusion construct on the plasma membrane (Nemeth, E., Tuttle, M.S., Powelson, J., Vaughn, M. B., Donovan, A., Ward, D. M. Ganz, T., Kaplan, J. (2004) Science 306, 2090-3). Addition of recombinant Hep25-His (having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6) promoted the internalization of FPN1-GFP (Fig. 7D). Similar results were obtained when the synthetic Hep-25 peptide was used as positive control.\n\n\nProduction and purification of polyclonal antibody against Hepcidin - Polyclonal serum was raised against Hep-25His (peptide having the sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6) in rabbits. After 3 boosts, serum was tested for antibody activity with ELISA (Fig. 8). The polyclonal antiserum was subjected to 33% ammonium sulfate precipitation to specifically precipitate IgG immunoglobulin. The precipitated and dialyzed antiserum contained antibodies both against hepcidin and His peptide. In order to remove all anti-His antibodies, the antiserum was subjected to repeated passages from a 6His-coupled sepharose column. Supernatants from each purification step were tested in ELISA assay against H25His, 6xHis peptide and BSA (Fig. 8). The five times purified antiserum recognized specifically H25His peptide (data not shown). So did the antiserum that was further purified with Hep-25His- sepharoseln order to determine its binding activity against native hepcidin we performed immunohistochemistry on paraffin embedded mouse liver sections (Fig. 9). The antibody showed a strong cytoplasmic staining that was abolished after preincubation with hepcidin25-His.\n\n\nCompetition ELISA assay - The recombinant peptide along with the antibody raised against it was used for the development of an immunological assay for the quantification of hepcidin in human serum. After determining the optimal \n\n concentration of antigen and antibody according to (J. R. Crowther, The ELISA guidebook, Methods MoI Biol 149 (2000) IM-IV, 1-413), we proceeded to the characterisation of our ELISA system.\n\n\nOur inhibition ELISA produces a typical calibration curve for the recombinant hepcidin25-His, which is shown in Fig. 10. The analytical limit of detection of the ELISA assay, defined as the concentration corresponding to the mean signal + 3 SD of 10 replicates of the zero calibrator was 5.4 μg/L. The measurement range was 10 - 1500 μg/L. For the statistical analysis of the reproducibility, linearity and recovery of the hepcidin ELISA assay, we used 3 serum samples ranging from low (22 μg/L) to high (150 μg/L) concentrations chosen from a large number of samples tested. The intra-assay CVs were 8-15% as evaluated by assaying 10 replicates of each sample in a single assay. The inter-assay CVs were 5-16% as evaluated by 7 subsequent measurements of the test samples. Analytical recovery was studied by adding the calibrator at 7.5, 30 and 75 μg/L in each serum sample and was found to range from 90-120% with a mean recovery index of 105%. Mean linearity was estimated at 97% after measuring 3 serial dilutions (1 :2, 1:4, 1 :8) of the 3 serum samples.\n\n\nIn order to determine whether our assay was providing biologically meaningful measurements, we tested serum samples from patients with anticipated low hepcidin levels (HJV associated juvenile haemochromatosis), compared to healthy controls. Mean hepcidin concentration was significantly lower in 7 patients with juvenile haemochromatosis (12.8 μg/L, p<0.05) compared to age-matched healthy controls (34.3 μg/L), as shown in Fig. 1 1. Our results are in agreement with previous findings regarding the levels of hepcidin in this disorder and allow us to assume that this new ELISA system can effectively quantify hepcidin in serum. However, it is important to note that the fold change between or inside the groups was much lower in our assay compared to previous reports using other quantification techniques. This might be a limitation in distinguishing differences among samples with tight variations. Furthermore, the possibility of interaction of the polyclonal antibody with other forms of hepcidin, such as the truncated 20-aminoacid hepcidin, cannot be excluded."

Ingesamt zeigen die Ergebnisse, dass mittels der erfindungsgemäßen Substanzen nicht nur spezifische Tumorarten behandelt werden können, sondern verschiedenste Tumorarten therapierbar sind.\nThe substances inhibit several receptors of tyrosine kinases, which are important for tumor growth and angiogenesis. The multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor is e.g. Also suitable for second-line therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or mestastasierten gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) preferred. Overall, the results show that not only specific types of tumors can be treated by means of the substances according to the invention, but that a wide variety of tumor types can be treated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n3.2: Kolonie-Assays\n3.2: colony assays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIm Kolonie-Assay werden Tumorstammzellen von verschiedenen menschlichen Tumorentitäten in Softagar kultiviert und die Ausbildung von Tumorkolonien in An- und Abwesenheiten von der erfindungsgemäßen Substanz (Beispiel 2.1, ggf. als Malat der Beispiel 2.2 oder 2.3) ausgezählt. Insgesamt wurde die Substanz an 25 verschiedenen Tumormodellen getestet. Zu den Tumormodellen gehörten Colon-, Pankreas- und Magenkarzinome, kleinzellige und nicht kleinzellige Lungentumore, Brust-, Ovar- und Nierenkarzinome sowie Melanome. Das breite Spektrum von verschiedenen Tumorentitäten sowie die große Anzahl von Modellen ermöglichen nach der Zellkultur eine erneute Prüfung der Wirksamkeit der Substanz und geben erste Hinweise darauf, ob die Substanz Wirkungsselektivität für bestimmte Tumorentitäten besitzt.\nIn the colony assay, tumor stem cells from various human tumor entities are cultured in soft agar and the formation of tumor colonies in presence and absence of the substance according to the invention (Example 2.1, possibly as malate of Example 2.2 or 2.3) is counted. Overall, the substance was tested on 25 different tumor models. The tumor models included colon, pancreatic and gastric carcinomas, small cell and non-small cell lung tumors, breast, ovarian and renal carcinomas and melanomas. The broad spectrum of different tumor entities as well as the large number of models allow after cell culture a re-examination of the effectiveness of the substance and give initial indications as to whether the substance possesses activity selectivity for certain tumor entities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDie Ergebnisse sind in der \nFigur 1\n dargestellt (graphische Analyse der Mittelwerte für die Substanz basierend auf den IC70-Werten). Die Balken stellen die IC70-Konzentrationen im Verhältnis zum Mittelwerte aller IC70-Werte dar. Bei Balken nach links ist der IC70-Wert für das betreffende Modell niedriger als der Mittelwert der IC70-Werte aller Modelle, d.h. diese Modelle sind sensitiver im Vergleich zum Durchschnitt aller Modelle. Balken nach rechts bedeuten höhere IC70-Werte als der Durchschnitt der Modelle und damit eine geringere Sensitivität.\nThe results are in the \n FIG. 1 \n represented (graphical analysis of the mean values for the substance based on the IC70 values). The bars represent the IC70 concentrations relative to the mean of all IC70 values. With bars to the left, the IC70 value for that model is lower than the mean of the IC70 values of all models, ie, these models are more sensitive to the average all models. Bars to the right indicate higher IC70 values than the average of the models and thus lower sensitivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTumormodelle: CXF = Colonkarzinome, GXF = Magenkarzinome, LXFA = nicht kleinzellige Adenokarzinome der Lunge, LXFE = Plattenepithelkarzinome der Lunge, LXFL = großzellige Lungenkarzinome, LXFS = kleinzellige Lungenkarzinome, MAXF = Brusttumore, MEXF = Melanome, OVXF = Ovarkarzinome, PAXF = Pankreaskarzinome, RXF = Nierenkarzinome\nTumor models: CXF = colon carcinomas, GXF = gastric carcinomas, LXFA = non-small cell lung adenocarcinomas, LXFE = large cell lung carcinomas, LXFS = small cell lung carcinomas, MAXF = breast tumors, MEXF = melanomas, OVXF = ovarian carcinomas, PAXF = pancreatic carcinomas, RXF = renal carcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMan erkennt, dass die Substanz im Kolonie-Assay mit sehr guten Ergebnissen getestet wurde. Die Substanz führte bei allen 25 Modellen zu einer Dosis-abhängigen Hemmung der Koloniebildung. Der mittlere IC50-Wert lag bei 15 µM. Der mittlere IC70-Wert betrug 20 µM. Die höchste Sensitivität zeigte ein nicht kleinzelliges Lungentumormodell mit einem IC50-Wert von 4 µM und einem IC70-Wert von 6 µM. Der höchste IC50-Wert (30 µM) bzw. IC70-Wert (40 µM) wurde für ein Brusttumormodell ermittelt.\nIt can be seen that the substance was tested in the colony assay with very good results. The substance resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of colony formation in all 25 models. The mean IC50 value was 15 μM. The mean IC70 value was 20 μM. The highest sensitivity was found in a non-small cell lung tumor model with an IC50 value of 4 μM and an IC70 value of 6 μM. The highest IC50 value (30 μM) or IC70 value (40 μM) was determined for a breast tumor model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAuch diese Ergebnisse belegen wiederum, dass die Substanz ein sehr breites Wirkspektrum zeigt. Es gab nicht ein einziges Modell, das nicht gehemmt wurde. Die Zellkulturergebnisse des Beispiels 3.1 ergaben bei den sechs getesteten Tumormodellen einen mittleren IC50-Wert von 6 µM und umspannten Werte zwischen 1 und 11 µM, so dass die Ergebnisse im Kolonie-Assay im Ergebnissbereich der Zellkulturversuche des Beispiels 3.1 liegen und diese folglich bestätigen.\nAgain, these results demonstrate that the substance has a very broad spectrum of activity. There was not a single model that was not inhibited. The cell culture results of Example 3.1 resulted in the  six tested tumor models a mean IC50 value of 6 uM and spanned values between 1 and 11 uM, so that the results in the colony assay in the range of results of the cell culture experiments of Example 3.1 and thus confirm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGenerell zeigen alle Kolonie-Assays, dass die Substanz vorteilhaft gegenüber dem Stand der Technik ist, weil sie ein breites therapeutisches Potential besitzt. Das breite Wirkspektrum spiegelt wider, dass die Substanz in Stoffwechselabläufe eingreift, die für alle Tumoren, unabhängig von der Entität, gemeinsam sind.\nIn general, all colony assays show that the substance is advantageous over the prior art because it has a broad therapeutic potential. The broad spectrum of activity reflects that the substance intervenes in metabolic processes common to all tumors, regardless of the entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n3.3: Vergleichsversuche\n3.3: Comparison experiments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn einem Kolonie-Assay entsprechend dem Beispiel 3.2 wurden bei einem Ovarialkarzinom (OVXF 550) folgende Werte für das literaturbekannte SU11248, 5-[5-Fluoro-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroindol-(3Z)-ylidenemethyl]-2,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylic Acid (2-Diethylaminoethyl)amide (\n \nPCT WO 01/60814 A2\n \n und \n \nJ.

Description\n\n\n\n\n Methods of making and using a cell penetrating peptide for enhanced delivery of nucleic acids, proteins, drugs, and adenovirus to tissues and cells, and compositions and kits\n\n\nRelated application\n\n\nThe present application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application serial number 60/966,591 filed August 29, 2007, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nTechnical field\n\n\nCompounds conjugated to peptides sequences are provided, for penetrating cells and tissues, to deliver the compounds for vaccines and other medicaments, and methods of synthesis and kits. Government support\n\n\nThe invention herein was made in part with support of grants NIH/NEI EYO 14991 and EY013887. The government has certain rights in the invention.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nOcular diseases and diseases of other tissues arising from infection, cancer, autoimmune and inflammatory conditions remain important medical issues in spite of advances in the pharmaceutical sector. In particular, blindness is among the most common disabilities in the U.S. The condition endophthalmitis is an infection within an eye, which is a complicating factor for accessibility of current anti-infective treatments.\n\n\nFor most drugs including those ranging from low molecular weight entities to proteins, the plasma membrane is an impermeable barrier. Protein transduction domains (PTDs) are known from viral genomes, however improved and optimized amino acid sequences and methods for intracellular delivery remain important issues limiting the use of these sequences for drug delivery into cells.\n\n\nImproved drug delivery compositions and methods are an important medical need.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nAccordingly, an aspect of the invention herein provides a method for delivery of a compound to a cell or a tissue for transduction into the cell or cells of the tissue, the method comprising: \n\n providing a peptide for overall delivery (POD) composition operably linked to the compound to obtain a conjugated compound, wherein the POD comprises a protein transduction domain (PTD); and contacting the cell or tissue with the conjugated compound, wherein the conjugated compound is transduced into the cell or the cells of the tissue. The term, \"POD\" was originally conceived as a peptide for ocular delivery, however in view of data showing that the peptide enhances delivery of a variety of compounds to many types of cells and tissues, the meaning of the term here is peptide for overall delivery.\n\n\nIn general, the POD has an amino acid sequence denoted by the expression (12221121 )χ or 111(12221121 )\nx\n represented by numerical symbols, in which neutral small residues are designated by the numeral 1, and positively charged residues are designated by the numeral 2, and x is a whole number integer from 1 to 8. The numeral, \"1\" indicates that a residue of the peptide is any of the following neutral (uncharged) small amino acids: alanine; glycine; serine, threonine, asparagine and the like; and the numeral, \"2\" indicates that a residue of the peptide is any of the following positively charged amino acids: lysine and arginine. For example, the POD has an amino acid sequence (ARKKAAKA) \nx\n or GGG(ARKKAAKA)\nX\n such that each amino acid is represented by the standard one letter code for amino acids, and x is a whole number integer from 1 to 8.\n\n\nMore specifically, the POD has an amino acid sequence (ARKKAAKA) \nx\n or GGG(ARKKAAKA)\nX\n and x is a whole number integer from 3 to 5.\n\n\nIn any of the above methods, related embodiments further include, following contacting, observing the conjugated compound entering the cell or cells of the tissue without disrupting cell membranes, for example, further observing localizing of the conjugated compound in cytoplasm, or further observing transducing of the conjugated compound into the nucleus.\n\n\nOther related embodiments of the above methods include, prior to contacting, formulating the conjugated compound as a medicament for diagnosing, prognosing, or treating a condition in a mammalian subject.\n\n\nAn embodiment of the method involves conjugating the POD to the compound which is a nucleic acid, for example, the nucleic acid is at least one selected from the group of a cDNA, an mRNA, a tRNA, and a small interfering RNA siRNA.\n\n\nAn alternative embodiment of the method involves conjugating the POD to the compound which is selected from the group of: a protein, a lipid, and a carbohydrate. \n\n An alternative embodiment of the method involves conjugating the POD to the compound which is a low molecular weight drug. For example, the low molecular weight drug has a molecular weight range of 100-5,000; or 200-3,000; or 300-1,500.\n\n\nIn general, the \"target\" cells or cells of a tissue are selected from the group of: ocular, oral, genital, nervous, cartilaginous (chondrocyte), liver, kidney, nerve, brain, epithelium, cardiac and muscular, so that cells of tissues of almost any developmental origin can be contacted and transduced by the POD and compound conjugated thereto. Thus, a suitable target is the cell or tissue which is in culture, such as cell or tissue culture. Alternatively, the cell or tissue is in vivo. In an embodiment of any of the methods herein, contacting further comprises providing the cell or tissue at least about 1 micromolar of the conjugated compound, for example, at least about 2 micromolar, 5 micromolar, 10 micromolar, or at least about 50 micromolar of the conjugated compound. Alternatively, contacting further comprises providing the cell or tissue at least about 40 μg of the conjugated compound, for example, at least about 100 μg or at least about 400 μg of the compound.\n\n\nIn general both for contacting a cell or tissue in culture or in vivo, contacting further comprises incubating at about 37 C, such that the cell is at a homeostatic temperature. Notwithstanding, certain cells or tissues are contacted at lower or higher temperatures, as is well known to the biologist of ordinary skill in the organism and tissue from which the cell has originated.\n\n\nIn a mammalian subject, contacting further comprises administering the conjugated compound to the subject by a route selected from the group consisting of: trans-ocular, intravitreal, topical, transdermal, intra-peritoneal, subcutaneous and intravenous.\n\n\nThe method of providing the conjugated compound further involves, if the compound is a protein, several possible ways of delivering the protein, for example, first by synthesizing a nucleic acid encoding a genetic fusion of the compound amino acid sequence to the sequence of amino acids of the POD.\n\n\nThen if the compound is a protein, the method further involves delivering by contacting the cell or the cells of the tissue with the nucleic acid sequence encoding the amino acid sequence of the fusion, and expressing the nucleic acid in the cell or cells of the tissue.\n\n\nAlternatively if the compound is a protein, the method of delivering further involves contacting an expression system cell with the nucleic acid encoding the fusion, expressing the \n\n nucleic acid in the expression system cell, isolating fusion protein, and contacting cell or cells of the tissue with isolated fusion protein.\n\n\nAlternatively if the compound is a protein, providing the conjugated compound further comprises chemically conjugating the compound to at least one amino acid of the POD amino acid sequence. Embodiments of the method in which the compound is a protein include that the conjugated compound which is a protein comprises an immunogen or a vaccine, for example, by providing the conjugated compound that is a protein by chemically synthesizing an amino acid sequence encoding a fusion of the compound to the sequence of amino acids of the POD. Another aspect of the invention provided herein is a composition for conjugating to a compound for delivery to a tissue or cell, the composition comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group OfGGG(ARKKAAKA)\n4\n (SEQ ID NO: 1) and (ARKKAAKA)\n4\n (SEQ ID NO: 3) such that the composition conjugated to the compound is transduced into a cell or cells of a tissue. The transduction activity is directed into the cell or the cells of a tissue, for example, selected from the group of: ocular, oral, genital, nervous, cartilaginous (chondrocyte), liver, kidney, epithelium, cardiac and muscular.\n\n\nThe ocular cell or tissue is selected from the group consisting of: retina, retinal pigment epithelium, retinal ganglion, cornea, optic nerve, and embryonic retina.\n\n\nAlso provided is a composition for conjugating to a compound for delivery into a cell or cells of a tissue, the composition comprising the amino acid sequence ARKKAAKA (SEQ ID NO: 4) or GGG(ARKKAAKA) (SEQ ID NO: 2).\n\n\nYet another aspect of the invention provided herein is a kit for synthesizing a conjugate comprising a peptide having at least one iteration of the amino acid sequence GGG(ARKKAAKA) (SEQ ID NO: 2) or ARKKAAKA (SEQ ID NO: 4) in a container, and instructions for use in conjugating the peptide to a compound. A related embodiment of the kit further includes reagents for cross linking the sequence and synthesizing the conjugate.\n\n\nBrief description of the drawings\n\n\nFigure 1 is a set of photomicrographs and line graphs that show that POD is cell penetrating, non membrane-permeabilizing peptide. Figure 1 panel A shows that formalin-fixed human embryonic retinoblast cells after incubation with lissamine (Liss) conjugated POD (L-POD) for 1, 5 and 60 minutes aggregate L-POD on the cell surface within 1 minute and internalize within 5 min with a cytoplasmic (arrow) or punctate (arrowhead) pattern. Inset, lissamine only treated cells. \n\n Figure 1 Panel B shows that live cells exposed to L-POD have a pattern of localization different from formalin fixed cells, being mostly punctate, with no evidence of lissamine uptake.\n\n\nFigure 1 panel C shows treatment of HER cells with trypsin following incubation with L-POD, which did not reduce the number of lissamine-positive cells, indicating that L-POD is internalized and not simply membrane associated.\n\n\nFigure 1 panel D shows that uptake of L-POD is temperature dependent, and was substantially more efficient at 37°C than at 4\n0\nC.\n\n\nFigure 1 panel E shows concentrations of FITC conjugated POD ranging from O to 2 nmol, which resulted in an increase in number of FITC-positive HER cells without an increase in propidium iodide -positive cells. TR, 1% Triton-XlOO.\n\n\nFigure 2 is a set of bar graphs and photomicrographs showing POD-mediated delivery of small and large molecules in cell culture. Figure 2 panel A shows that cysteine containing POD (C-POD) in Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n buffer was capable of delivering plasmid DNA to human embryonic retinoblasts (HER).\n\n\nFigure 2 panel B shows electron microscopy of C-POD complexed with plasmid DNA in either 5% dextrose or NazHP0\n4\n buffer, horizontal bar equals 1 μm.\n\n\nFigure 2 panel C shows that C-POD delivered siRNA to HER cells and silenced GFP expression more efficiently than did siRNA alone.\n\n\nFigure 2 panel D shows that Biotin conjugated POD (B-POD) conjugated to quantum dots via a streptavidin bridge allowed uptake of the quantum dots within 15 minutes.\n\n\nFigure 2 panel E shows no evidence of quantum dot uptake at 120 min in HER cells was observed in the absence of B-POD.\n\n\nFigure 3 is a line graph and a bar graph showing that POD uptake was influenced by cell surface proteoglycans and POD has microbicidal activity.\n\n\nFigure 3 panel A shows that pre incubation of lissamine conjugated POD (L-POD) with either heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate reduced uptake of L-POD, and these same proteoglycans have little influence on uptake of an integrin-binding RGD-containing TRITC- labeled peptide.\n\n\nFigure 3 panel B shows that incubation of cysteine containing POD (C-POD) with E coli prior to plating reduced number of colonies per plate in a concentration dependent manner. \n\n Figure 4 is a set of photomicrographs showing that POD penetrates and carries cargo to retinal tissues in vivo.\n\n\nFigure 4 panel A shows that subretinal injection of lissamine conjugated POD (L-POD) into adult mice transduced approximately 40% of neural retina after 2 hours (4X) and was seen in several layers of the retina (20X). L-POD penetrated retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), inner and outer segments (IS, OS), cell bodies in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), cells in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and ganglion cells (GC)- 4OX.\n\n\nFigure 4 panel B shows that intravitreal injection of L-POD transduced approximately 85% of the neural retina within 2 hours (4X). Transduction was observed primarily of the GCL, INL (20X) and dendrites, with no significant transduction of RPE or ONL (40X).\n\n\nFigure 4 panel C shows delivery of biotin conjugated dots (QDPOD) to the subretinal space after 2 hrs permitted binding to rod outer segments and no significant uptake by the ONL. Longer incubation times of 20 hrs resulted in significant uptake by RPE and ONL. Insets are control quantum dots without POD at similar time points. Figure 4 panel D shows results obtained from intravitreal injection of QDPOD, with binding observed to inner limiting membrane and GCL after 2 hours and uptake within 20hrs. Insets show results from control quantum dots without POD at similar time points. BF, brightfield.\n\n\nFigure 5 is a set of photographs and photomicrographs that show that POD penetrates ocular tissues by topical application in vivo.\n\n\nFigure 5 panel A shows data from incubation of lissamine conjugated POD (L-POD) with whole mouse eye in vivo for 45 min. The L-POD transduced most of the external ocular tissues including cornea, sclera and optic nerve. Lissamine only weakly stained cornea and sclera with no staining of optic nerve.\n\n\nFigure 5 panel B shows data from cross sections of eye in panel A observing that all of the outer surfaces of the eye were transduced by L-POD.\n\n\nFigure 5 panel C shows close examination of regions marked A and B in panel B concluding that L-POD was taken up by corneal epithelium and sclera/choroid. Figure 5 panel D shows longitudinal and cross sections of optic nerve that indicate that outer layers of optic nerve were transduced by L-POD and not by lissamine at the 45 min time point. Insets are lissamine only controls. \n\n Figure 6 is a set of drawings and bar graphs showing adenovirus vectors pseudotyped with POD display altered tropism.\n\n\nFigure 6 panel A is a set of drawings showing comparison of adenovirus serotype pIX C terminus and the pIX fusion protein containing Gl 1(ARKKAAKA)\n3\n or pIX-PODs and schematic representation of the location of pIX-PODs trimers between the hexons.\n\n\nFigure 6 panel B is a set of bar graphs showing protein transduction following infection of Chang C or HER 911 cells by the viruses shown in Figure 6 panel A, with or without pre incubation with chondroitin sulfate or heparan sulfate.\n\n\nFigure 7 is a set of photomicrographs showing that de novo synthesized POD-GFP fusion protein localizes to the nucleus.\n\n\nFigure 7 panel A shows HER cells transfected with control pGFPHis. Figure 7 panel B shows HER cells transfected with pPODGFPHis. These plasmids express control of His-tagged GFP or POD-GFP respectively. The data show that GFP localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 7 panel A), and that POD-GFP localizes primarily to the nucleus (Figure 7 panel B). Furthermore, POD-GFP appears to be concentrated in sub nuclear compartments (Figure 7, panel B, arrowheads). BF, brightfield.\n\n\nFigure 8 is a drawing and a set of photographs, showing purification of POD-GFP from adenovirus-infected HER cells. Expression cassettes encoding POD-GFP or control GFP were cloned into the deleted El region (ΔE1) of a first generation adenovirus vector. POD was fused to GFP via a flexible polyglycine linker (Figure 8 panel A).\n\n\nFigure 8 panel B, left photograph, shows silver staining of purified protein indicated major bands of the predicted molecular weights for POD-GFP and GFP following analyses by PAGE. Anti-GFP Western blot confirmed that these proteins contained GFP (panel B, right photograph). CMV, cytomegalovirus; 6XHis, His tag; BGH pA, bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal; ITR, inverted terminal repeat; MLT, major late transcription unit; El-\n\n\nE4; early regions 1-4 respectively.\n\n\nFigure 9 is a set of photomicrographs and a bar graph showing transduction properties of POD-GFP in vitro.\n\n\nFigure 9 panel A is a bar graph showing POD-GFP or control GFP protein that was incubated with HER cells for 2 hours and the GFP-positive cells that were counted by FACS. \n\n Figure 9 panel B shows that POD-GFP entered cells and colocalized in part with Lysotracker, a red colored marker of late endosomes.\n\n\nFigure 10 is a set of photomicrographs showing transduction properties of POD-GFP following subretinal injection in vivo. POD-GFP or control GFP protein was injected into the subretinal space of adult mice.\n\n\nFigure 10 panel A data show that control GFP was barely detectable above background auto fluorescence.\n\n\nFigure 10 panel B shows and that POD-GFP entered the RPE and photoreceptor cell bodies in the ONL. POD-GFP localized to photoreceptor nuclei in both a perinuclear and punctate manner (arrowheads). ONL, Outer nuclear Layer; INL, Inner Nuclear Layer; GCL, Ganglion Cell Layer; RPE, Retinal Pigment Epithelium\n\n\nFigure 11 is a set of photomicrographs showing transduction properties of POD-GFP following intravitreal injection in vivo. POD-GFP or GFP protein was injected into the intravitreal space of adult mice and eyes harvested after 6 hours.\n\n\nFigure 11 panel A data show that control GFP could not be detected above background autofluorescence .\n\n\nFigure 11 panel B shows that POD-GFP was detected in the ganglion cells and a subset of cells in the inner nuclear layer (INL; arrowhead) and dendrites in the inner retina (arrow). ONL, Outer nuclear Layer; INL, Inner Nuclear Layer; GCL, Ganglion Cell Layer; RPE, Retinal Pigment Epithelium\n\n\nFigure 12 is a set of photomicrographs and photographs showing transduction of lens capsule following intravitreal injection and topical application of POD-GFP on murine cornea in vivo.\n\n\nFigure 12 panel A shows POD-GFP or control GFP protein that was injected into the intravitreal space of adult mice and eyes harvested after 6 hours and frozen sections prepared from lens revealed significant binding of POD-GFP to the lens capsule. Recombinant POD- GFP or control GFP proteins was applied to the eyes of anesthetized adult mice and eyes were washed and harvested 45 minutes later. The data show that control GFP does not substantially bind to ocular tissues and is not internalized, and POD-GFP binds to the entire corneal surface and can be readily detected in corneal wholemounts. \n\n Figure 12 panel B data from transverse sections of cornea indicate that POD-GFP localizes to the corneal epithelium.\n\n\nFigure 13 is a set of photomicrographs showing topical application of POD-GFP to shaved skin in vivo. POD-GFP or control GFP protein was applied to skin for 24 hours.\n\n\nFigure 13 panel A data show that control GFP does not bind skin beyond that of auto fluorescence.\n\n\nFigure 13 panel B data show that POD-GFP binds to the epidermis. Although hair and papilla of the hair were also GFP-positive in sections exposed to POD-GFP, a significant portion of this signal was due to auto fluorescence. E, Epidermis; P, Papilla.\n\n\nFigure 14 is a set of bar graphs and photomicrographs showing that the cell penetrating peptide cPOD can deliver genes in vitro but not in vivo to quiescent cells.\n\n\nFigure 14 panel A shows A549 cells which were transfected with c-POD/pCMVGFP complexes with or without prior serum-starvation for 48 hours, followed by FACS counting of the number of GFP-positive cells. The number of cells and the total GFP- intensity is substantially reduced in conditions inhibiting mitosis.\n\n\nFigure 14 panel B is a bar graph of relative light units (RLU) from A549 cells which were transfected with a c-POD/pCAGLuc complex as in panel A, to quantitate protein levels. While expression increased after compaction in serum-starved cells (p<0.05), significantly less was observed than expression in dividing cells (p<0.005).\n\n\nFigure 14 panel C is a bar graph that shows that c-POD is able to deliver a luciferase transgene to primary cells in explants but not when injected into quiescent ocular tissue in vivo. pCAGLuc was added to explants of ocular tissue at two different N:P ratios. Compaction significantly increased luciferase expression relative to plasmid alone in RPE/sclera explants at an N:P ratio of 8.6 (p<0.05) but not at an N.P of 4.3 (p>0.05). In vivo assay for transfection was done by injection of 0.2μg of pCAGLuc subretinally in 2μl. There was no significant increase in luciferase expression in vivo using compacted plasmid.\n\n\nFigure 15 is a set of photomicrographs and photographs showing that pegylation of cPOD reduces aggregation while preserving the ability to compact DNA.\n\n\nFigure 15 panel A shows that cPOD/DNA complexes form large aggregates in cell culture. Rhodamine labeled DNA was complexed with c-POD and added to HER cells in culture and observed after 24 hours. \n\n Figure 15 panel B shows that pegylation of c-POD results in a gel shift of the protein band. cPOD was observed to be a ~3.5kD peptide that migrated as a pentamer at ~17.5kD. The addition of a 1 OkD PEG increased the molecular weight to primarily 27.5kD, with higher species also seen, indicating that a PEG molecule is predominantly added to only one cPOD peptide in a pentamer.\n\n\nFigure 15 panel C shows that pegylated cPOD (PEG-POD) was able to compact DNA and this compaction was relieved upon prior degradation of the peptide with trypsin.\n\n\nFigure 15 panel D shows that PEG-POD/Rhodamine labeled DNA nanoparticles formed a diffuse stain across cells, and that pegylation reduced formation of large aggregates. Scale bar = 50μm.\n\n\nFigure 16 is a set of photomicrographs and a bar graph that show that PEG-POD compacts DNA to form small, discrete nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that pPOD/DNA formed small compact nanoparticles. Addition of each of 5% dextrose buffer, plasmid alone, or compacted plasmid was visualized using uranyl acetate stain. Plasmid DNA formed large irregular aggregates. PEG-POD/DNA nanoparticles were smaller, spherical, and more homogeneous in size.\n\n\nFigure 17 is a set of photomicrographs that show that PEG-POD nanoparticles have different localization in vivo compared to cPOD compacted DNA. Rhodamine-labeled DNA compacted with PEG-POD (PEG-POD~RhoDNA) or cPOD (cPOD-RhoDNA) was injected subretinally and harvested after two hours. PEG-POD~RhoDNA particles appeared as punctuate and diffuse, staining within the RPE cell layer. cPOD-RhoDNA appeared to bind the surface of the RPE cells only and be isolated to the subretinal space.\n\n\nFigure 18 is a set of bar graphs showing that PEG-POD~Luc nanoparticles transfect ocular tissue in vivo after subretinal injection more efficiently than other CPPs and are dose- dependent. Samples were analyzed at 48 hours after injection and 1.2μg DNA PEG-POD~Luc nanoparticles were injected into the subretinal space of adult BALB/C mice and exhibited expression levels significantly higher than 1.2μg DNA alone (p<0.0001) or uninjected controls (pO.OOOl). When only 0.6μg of PEG-POD nanoparticles were injected in the same volume, there was still a significant increase in expression over uninjected controls (p<0.001) and 1.2μg naked DNA (p<0.05) was observed, and a significant reduction compared to 1.2μg of PEG- POD nanoparticles (p<0.05). PEG-TAT~Luc was significantly increased compared to 1.2μg \n\n DNA alone (p<0.05) and uninjected controls (p<0.005). PEG-CK30~Luc showed the lowest expression of the three cell penetrating peptides but was still significantly increased above 1.2μg DNA alone (p<0.05) and uninjected controls (p<0.005). PEG-POD nanoparticles showed a significant increase in transfection compared to PEG-CK30 (p<0.005). PEG-TAT nanoparticles were not significantly different from those formed by either PEG-POD or PEG- CK30 (p>0.05). These results show that all three cell penetrating peptides significantly increase peptide transfection in vivo compared to DNA alone.\n\n\nFigure 18 panel A shows results for each individual injection, expressed in RLU/mg. Dotted line is equal to mean+3 SD. Figure 18 panel B shows the averages of the injections, expressed as RLU/mg. Data from PEG-CK30 injection fell below mean + 3SD was not included.\n\n\nFigure 18 panel C shows the fold increase of nanoparticle injections compared-to 1.2μg naked DNA.\n\n\nFigure 19 is a set of photographs showing PEG-POD, PEG-TAT and PEG-CK30 compacted LacZ nanoparticles transfect RPE cells. To examine β-galactosidase expression, 1.2μg each of PEG-POD~LacZ, PEG-T AT~LacZ, or PEG-CK30~LacZ nanoparticles was injected subretinally in BALB/CJ mice and expression assayed 48 hours after injection. Analysis showed punctate patches of staining in the RPE, visible through the sclera and choroids that correlated with the relative luciferase levels seen with each peptide. Sections show that expression was localized in the RPE. No β-galactosidase expression was detected in any of the control eyes. A representative buffer injected eye is shown.\n\n\nFigure 20 is a photograph of an electrophoretogram and a bar graph, showing that compaction of DNA confers protection against DNase and increased transfection in vivo during intravenous injection.\n\n\nFigure 20 panel A shows that PEG-POD protected DNA from DNAse I digestion. Serum nuclease activity decreases the half-life of plasmid DNA. In the absence of pronase only pCAGLuc, the naked plasmid, was able to migrate into the agarose gel while the nanoparticles PEG-POD-Luc remained compacted within the well. After a ten minute incubation with pronase each of pCAGLuc and PEG-POD~Luc DNA was observed to migrate in the gel. DNA or nanoparticles were incubated for 15 minutes with DNase I followed by a 10-minute incubation with pronase, which allowed visualization of the compacted DNA by degrading PEG-POD. After the addition of 0.25U DNase I, pCAGLuc has started to show signs of \n\n degradation, while pPOD~Luc is still intact. At a higher concentration with 2.5U DNase I added, the pCAGLuc was completely degraded and was no longer visible, while pPOD~Luc showed only minor degradation.\n\n\nFigure 20 panel B shows that PEG-POD~Luc increased transfection efficiency in the lung. BALB/C mice were injected with 150μL of 5% dextrose buffer containing either 40μg pCAGLuc, lOμg PEG-POD~Luc, or 40μg PEG-POD~Luc. Luciferase expression was observed to have increased significantly above background when lOμg PEG-POD~Luc (p<0.05) or 40μg PEG-POD~Luc was injected (p<0.0001). Increasing the quantity of PEG- POD-Luc injected from lOμg to 40μg resulted in a significant increase in luciferase expression (pO.OOOl). Naked plasmid alone did not significantly express luciferase above uninjected mice lung (p>0.05).\n\n\nFigure 21 is a line graph and a bar graph showing by functional analysis that PEG-POD nanoparticles were non-toxic. Mice were injected in the subretinal space with either 0.7μg pPOD~Luc in lμl (n=4) or lμl 5% dextrose (n=4), the same buffer as the nanoparticles, in adult (6-8 week) C57 males. After 48-hours, ERGs were performed at two log intensities. Both the PEG-POD-Luc and mock injected eyes had normal waves with a defined A and B-waves.\n\n\nFigure 21 panel A representative tracings from mice after 48 hours at -0 Log Light Intensity. Figure 21 panel B shows data from the waves analyzed for A and B-wave amplitude and plotted by Log Light Intensity. There was no significant difference between nanoparticle and buffer injections under any of the test conditions (p>0.05).\n\n\nDetailed Description According to the National Institute of Health, ocular diseases that lead to blindness are one of the most common causes of disability in the United States [National Eye Institute (1999-2003). A Report of the National Eye Council, National Institutes of Health]. Some common diseases of the retina include age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and glaucoma, which are associated with degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells respectively Hartong, DT et al. 2006 Lancet 368:1795-1809; Rattner A et al. 2006 Nat Rev Neurosci 7: 860-872]. Infections, dystrophies or rejection of transplanted corneas arc also amongst common causes of vision loss [Moffatt SL et al. 2005 Clin Experiment Ophthalmol33: 642-657]. Improvements in healthcare that have increased human life expectancy ironically result in a prediction of a significant \n\n increase in the frequency of diseases such as AMD or extend the burden associated with currently untreatable diseases such as RP [National Eye Institute (1999-2003). A Report of the National Eye Council, National Institutes of Health]. Therefore, the need to develop gene and drug delivery technologies for treatment of genetic and acquired ocular disorders is considerable.\n\n\nAs in other tissues, proteins or drugs directed at intracellular ocular targets need to be sufficiently polar to be easily administered [Kelder J et al. 1999 Pharm Res 16: 1514-1519]. However, for the majority of such molecules, the plasma membrane represents an impermeable barrier. Remarkably, a few select proteins such as the human- immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Tat [Frankel AD et al.l988 Cell 55: 1189-1193], herpes simplex virus (HSV) VP22 [Phelan A et al. 1998 Intercellular delivery of functional p53 by the herpesvirus protein VP22 [see comments] Nat Biotechnol 16: 440-443], and the Drosophila melanogaster Antennapedia homeodomain [Derossi D et al. 1994 J Bioi Chem 269: 10444-10450] possess the ability to traverse intact biological membranes. Interrogation of the structures of such proteins has led to the hypothesis that these proteins contain modules that confer the property of 'protein transduction' and hence such sequences are generally referred to as protein transduction domains (PTD) as reviewed in [Dietz GP et al. 2004 MoI Cell Neurosci 27: 85-131]. PTDs can be isolated and incorporated into heterologous proteins and peptides, conferring novel protein transduction properties to such recombinant molecules. Initial experiments by several groups on the use of PTDs generated conflicting data and substantial debate regarding their properties and mode of action [Lundberg M et al. 2001 Nat Biotechnoll9: 713-714; Falnes PO et al. 2001 Biochemistry 40: 4349-4358]. Some of the issues addressed were whether the phenomenon of protein transduction was in fact real or only an artifact of fixation and whether the transduction was receptor, energy and/ or temperature dependent [Richard JP et al. 2003 J Bioi Chem 278: 585-590]. The PTD of both HIV Tat [Cashman SM et al. 2003 MoI Ther 8: 130-142] and HSV VP22 [Cashman SM et al. 2002 MoI Ther 6: 813-823] have valid transduction properties, as shown for ocular cell lines and tissues.\n\n\nThe examples herein were motivated to determine whether the novel peptide GGG(ARKKAAKA)\n4\n, mw=3.5Kd that has not previously been shown to have PTD properties can efficiently deliver small molecules including fluorescent probes and siRNA and large molecules including plasmid DNA and quantum dots to cells in culture and to murine ocular tissues in vivo. The results indicate that GGG(ARKKAAKA)\n4\n is an efficient 'peptide for ocular delivery (POD)' of small and large molecules across the plasma membrane, both in vitro and in vivo and hence may have potential for the delivery of genes and drugs to human ocular tissues.\n\n\nπ \n\n Almost 200 different loci and Ϊ30 different genes responsible for inherited retinal degeneration have thus far been identified, making retinal degeneration one of the most heterogeneous genetic disorders in humans (www.retnet.org). A large number of these genes are expressed exclusively in the photoreceptors or retinal neurons. Efficient delivery of therapeutic proteins into retinal cells is currently limited to the use of recombinant viruses for delivery of DNA expression cassettes- a potentially harmful approach that can in some cases lead to irreversible rearrangement of the host genome [Donsante A et al. 2007 Science 317: 477]. Hence, relatively intensive and significantly protracted preclinical studies need to be performed prior to the use of gene delivery in humans. Given the large number of genes involved in retinal degeneration, preclinical testing of gene therapy approaches for every gene is cost and time prohibitive. Hence, accelerated progress towards the development of therapies for many retinal degenerations may be achieved by the theoretically less risky approach of protein delivery- administration of which can be readily terminated upon the initial observation of any adverse events. For example, although viral-mediated gene transfer of ciliary neurotrophic factor\n\n\n(CNTF) to animal models of retinal degeneration has been documented to be deleterious [Buch PK et al. 2006 MoI Ther 14: 700-709], phase I trials have been safely completed by use of encapsulated CNTF-producing cells that could be readily removed from the ocular compartment of retinitis pigmentosa patients [Sieving PA et al. 2006 Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 103 : 3896-3901 ]. Should viral gene transfer of CNTF have been undertaken in those trials, the presumed risk to patients may have been greater and irreversible. For some retinal degenerations such as rhodopsin or peripherin/RDS- associated retinitis pigmentosa (RP), over-expression of therapeutic gene product may be deleterious, as has been observed for both viral gene transfer [Sarra GM et al. 2001 Hum MoI Genet 10: 2353-2361] and in transgenic mice [Tan E et al. 2001 Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 42: 589-600]. Hence, attempts at gene delivery to treat RP patients could theoretically promote a more rapid rate of photoreceptor degeneration than the absence of any therapy. Such a condition may not readily be reversible with the majority of gene therapy approaches that typically rely on strong viral promoters or truncated cell-specific promoters. In the context of retinal degeneration, which is typically a slow progressive disease, it is envisaged herein that the use of slow release formulations or depots for long-term delivery of therapeutic proteins. However, the majority of macromolecules involved in retinal degeneration, or for that matter any disease, do not readily cross the plasma membrane and do not penetrate neural tissues such as the retina very efficiently. \n\n Proteins exhibiting the unusual property of traversing lipid bilayers contain PTDs that can be chemically cross-linked to heterologous proteins, antibodies and enzymes and facilitate their transport across the plasma membrane [Fawell S et al. 1994 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91 : 664-668; Anderson DC et al. 1993 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 194: 876-884]. Protein transduction was first reported a decade ago by Green and Frankel who independently demonstrated that the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) TAT protein was able to enter cells when added to the surrounding media [Frankel AD et al. 1988 Cell 55: 1189-1193; Green M et al. 1988 Cell 55: 1179-1188]. The most intensively studied PTDs are the Drosophila homeotic transcription factor ANTP (encoded by the antennapedia gene) and the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) VP22 [Joliot A et al. 1991 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 88: 1864-1868;\n\n\nJoliot AH et al. 1991 New Biol 3: 1121-1134; Elliott G et al. 1997 Cell 88: 223-233]. A variety of additional cell penetrating peptides have since been discovered [Vives E et al. 2008. Cell- penetrating and cell-targeting peptides in drug delivery. Biochim Biophys Acta]. Apart from HIV TAT, there is very limited information available on the performance of PTDs in neuronal tissues in vivo.\n\n\nThe purpose of the present examples is to examine the potential of genetically fusing biologically relevant macromolecules such as whole proteins to POD in order to determine whether novel transduction properties are conferred upon the recombinant fusion protein in terms of delivery into the retinal photoreceptors and interneurons. For proof-of-principle, delivery of a POD-GFP fusion protein to retinal cells was examined in vitro and in vivo. Examples herein show that POD-fusion proteins allow the penetration and dispersion of macromolecules into retinal cells and tissues and hence may have significant therapeutic applications for a variety of disorders of the CNS including blindness.\n\n\nExamples herein show that POD is useful also to confer protein transduction properties to recombinant adenovirus vectors to enhance transduction of cells. Adenovirus entry is a two- step process, the first involving the binding of the knob domain of fiber to the coxsackie adenovirus receptor (CAR) [Bergelson JM et al. 1997 Science 275: 11320-1323]. The second step involves an interaction of cell surface αvβ5 integrins with an RGD motif in the adenovirus penton base, allowing entry of the virus by receptor-mediated endocytosis [Wickham TJ et al. 1993 Cell 73: 309-319]. In order to display POD on virion surfaces, we genetically modified the adenovirus backbone such that instead of expressing the coat protein DC (pDC), the recombinant virus instead expressed a fusion protein consisting of pDC and POD joined by a flexible poly-glycine linker (Figure 6 panel A). Since pDC is incorporated into virions as a trimer between each hexon, there are theoretically 240 PODs on the virion surface. Virions \n\n with full length pIX-POD fusion proteins i.e. pIX-Gl 1(ARKKAAKA)\n4\n (SEQ ID NO: 3) were not rescued, however, virions displaying pEX-Gl 1(ARKKAAKA)\n3\n (i.e. a plasmid carrying three iterations of SEQ ID NO: 4) were rescued. This recombinant virus also contained a GFP expression cassette regulated by the chicken βactin promoter in the deleted El region - Ad5pIXPODs.\n\n\nIn order to examine the potential role of POD on the virion coat in the absence of the RGD-αvβ5 integrin interaction that is responsible for internalization of the virus by endocytosis, a virus was rescued with the above modification in combination with a deletion in the RGD domain of penton base-Ad5pDCPODsΔRGD. The parental control virus contains the same GFP expression cassette without any modifications to pDC or penton base\n\n\n(Ad5CAGGFP). As HER cells allow a productive viral infection and replication, transduction was examined of human conjunctival Chang C cells by each of the above viruses. Data show that whereas Ad5CAGGFP transduced 24.94± 2.66 % of Chang C cells, Ad5pIXPODs and Ad5pIXPODsΔRGD transduced 38.16± 5.07 and 33.38± 6.49 % cells respectively at the same moi. It was concluded that PODs displayed on the surface of the adenovirus coat enhance transduction of Chang C cells by PODpseudotyped viruses. Pre incubation of each virus with chondroitan sulfate reduced infection of Chang C cells by each of the viruses in a similar manner to the reduction seen with POD peptide. Pre incubation with chondroitan sulfate led to 17.19 ± 1.13%, 16.65 ± 0.61%, and 20.85 ± 3.41% GFP-positive Chang C cells when infected with Ad5CAGGFP, Ad5pIXPODs, and Ad5pIXPODsΔRGD respectively. These data showed that these viruses are able to use POD during cell entry. Similarly, incubation with heparan sulfate also reduced infection of Chang C cells by each of the viruses by 29.12, 42.59, 34.04 % for Ad5CAGGFP, Ad5pIXPODs and Ad5pIXPODsΔRGD respectively. The significant reduction in the rate of infection of all three viruses indicates that the proteoglycans play a greater role in viral infection than the integrins.\n\n\nIn HER cells, a cell line that allows viral replication, we observed a greater rate of infection for each virus. Ad5CAGGFP, Ad5pIXPODs and Ad5pIXPODsΔRGD infected 78.54± 8.8%, 83.47± 8.11%, and 69.67± 3.86 % of cells, respectively. The decrease in infection rate from the proteoglycans was less pronounced in HER cells when compared with Chang C cells. Pre-incubation with chondroitan sulfate reduced the number of infected cells to 75.73± 1.88%, 69.82± 0.61%, and 37.75± 5.24% for Ad5CAGGFP, Ad5pIXPODs and Ad5pIXPODsΔRGD respectively. Only the Ad5pIXPODs and Ad5pIXPODsΔRGD results were significant and only the Ad5pIXPODsΔRGD was substantially inhibited. Heparin sulfate gave similar results for the Ad5CAGGFP and Ad5pIXPODs viruses with 69.46± 5.18% (not \n\n significant) and 59.19± 3.61% (p < 0.05) of cells infected with virus. However, heparin sulfate appeared to enhance viral infection of Ad5pIXPODsΔRGD resulting in 81.02 ± 2.58% positive cells.\n\n\nOne goal of examples herein was to identify a peptide that would act efficiently as a PTD in ocular tissues such as the retina in vivo. It is envisioned that such a peptide should resemble the glycosaminoglycan binding regions of proteins abundantly present in the retina. Two such proteins include acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors, aFGF and bFGF, respectively [Bugra K et al. 1997 J MoI Neurosci 9: 13-25]. The glycosaminoglycan chondroitan sulphate is known to be abundantly present in adult retina. Heparan sulfate is abundantly expressed during development but its expression is substantially reduced in adult retina. Molecular modeling of protein-glycosaminoglycan interactions of aFGF and bFGF indicates that they contain basic heparin-binding regions of the form XBBBXXBX, where X and B are hydropathic and basic residues respectively [Cardin AD et al. 1989 Arteriosclerosis 9: 21-32]. Following these observations, Verrechio and colleagues [Verrecchio A et al. 2000 J Bioi Chem 275 : 7701 -7707] have shown that peptides of the form (XBBBXXBX)n and (XBBXBX)n where n=l to 6, bind heparan. In addition, circular dichroism indicated that heparan-binding peptides converted from a charged coil to an alpha-helix upon heparan binding. Examples herein examine whether such peptides may have protein transduction properties. A variety of sequences for protein transduction were tested prior to the detailed examination of POD presented in examples herein.\n\n\nU. S. patent number 6,855,801 issued February 15, 2005 (inventors San Antonio et al.) shows peptides with strong affinity for glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans (PGs) that interact with heparin. Sequences of peptides were based on consensus sequences XBBXBX and XBBBXXBX that were obtained from an analysis of a wide range of known heparin-binding proteins, using as many as 6 repeating units of these sequences. San Antonio et al. describe methods of using these peptides to provide cell adhesion to natural or synthetic surfaces, for heparin binding to block uptake and clearance of heparin, and to modulate actions of various PGs and GAGs.\n\n\nU.S. patent number 7,259,140 issued August 21, 2007 San Antonio et al. describes additional peptides similar to these in 6,855,801 and having further residues such as cysteine and proline. These bind to heparin, and are used for example, in methods for reducing plasma heparin levels in a subject or to treat a mast cell serine protease-associated disorder.\n\n\nDue to initial controversies surrounding the phenomenon of protein transduction, it is shown herein that POD enters cells without the need for fixation, although fixation does lead to \n\n an artifact in terms of cellular localization of POD. While cytoplasmic localization was primarily observed in formalin fixed cells within 5 min, POD appeared punctate and localized perhaps to endocytic vesicles in live cells even after 60 min. Interestingly, at 1 min post incubation with POD, cells became opaque to 558nm excitation -potentially due to aggregation or capping of cell-surface proteoglycans upon POD binding [Martinho RG et al. 1996 MoI Bioi Cell 7: 1771-1788]. Evidence for uptake and not simply plasma membrane binding was demonstrated by treatment of live cells with trypsin, which failed to reduce the fluorescence associated with POD-transduced cells. Uptake was also shown to be temperature dependant. One concern in using a peptide such as POD for ocular gene or drug delivery would be potential toxicity during the process of traversing the cell membrane. To address this issue, uptake of propidium iodide by cells following incubation with POD was examined, and no increase in uptake was observed. These initial results show lack of toxicity. Data herein support a temperature-dependent mechanism, and no reduction in peptide uptake was observed in the presence of inhibitors of endocytosis. Chlorpromazine reportedly blocks clathrin coated pit-dependent endocytosis and genistein and filipin are known inhibitors of caveolae. However, no significant reduction in the uptake of L-POD was found herein with these inhibitors.\n\n\nPOD delivery of small molecules like siRNA efficiently across the plasma membrane has applications in treatment of ocular disease in humans. Currently several ongoing clinical trials target degradation of mRNA associated with either vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or the receptor for the treatment of AMD [Michels S et al. 2006 Expert Opin Investig Drugs 15:779-793]. Indeed, use of siRNA for treatment of ocular disease in humans is at a particularly advanced stage of development relative to other diseases [Check E 2004 Nature 430:819]. Since the target of siRNAs is intracellular, efficient delivery across the plasma membrane in a non-toxic manner is highly desirable. POD potentially enhances siRNA delivery to the retina, allowing use of reduced concentrations of siRNA resulting in reduced toxic side effects associated with for example non-specific siRNA mediated silencing. Enhanced delivery of RNA molecules such as the aptamer macugen that is currently used to target VEGF in the treatment of AMD [Ng EW et al. 2006 Nat Rev Drug Discov 5: 123-132] may also be potentially achieved. POD may also be used to deliver siRNA and DNA in cell culture to study a variety of cellular processes.\n\n\nExamples herein show that delivery of POD to the subretinal and intravitreal space allowed penetration of a variety of cell types in the retina. Transduction of photoreceptors will have application in the treatment of diseases such as RP whereas transduction of RPE cells will have application in the treatment of AMD. Conversely, intravitreal injection allowed targeting \n\n of ganglion cells, degeneration of which is associated with glaucoma. POD-mediated delivery of growth factors or anti-apoptotic factors to the ganglion cells may slow the rate of degeneration of such cells. While quantum dots took substantially longer to penetrate the retina than L-POD, perhaps due to their larger size, demonstration of the delivery of such large molecules is further support for the potential use of POD in the delivery of biologicals to the retina. Such biologicals may include antibodies or antibody fragments such as avastin and lucentis respectively that are currently also used in the treatment of AMD [Pieramici DJ et al. 2006 Expert Opin Biol Ther 6: 1237-1245]. One may envision fusion proteins with POD for rapid and enhanced penetration of retinal tissues. Surprisingly, L-POD administered topically reached the optic nerve within 45 min.\n\n\nThis finding herein shows utility for treatment of diseases such as Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy or Ischemic Optic Neuropathy. Penetration of the entire sclera and potentially the choroid may allow non invasive delivery of drugs or genes to choroidal blood vessels and endothelial cells, proliferation of which is involved in a variety of ocular diseases including AMD. Topical administration of POD-conjugated drugs to the cornea can enhance delivery of drugs to the corneal epithelium and into the anterior chamber. This may be particularly useful given that currently less than 1% of drug penetrates into ocular tissue following topical administration [Shell JW 1984 Surv Ophthalmol 29: 117-128].\n\n\nExamples herein show that adenovirus vectors can be modified with POD to enhance uptake of adenovirus by human conjunctival Chang C cells. These examples have value in treatment of a variety of ocular and non-ocular diseases. Adenovirus vectors have been shown to be a viable and efficacious method of delivering genes to human ocular tissues in two clinical trials thus far [Campochiaro PA et al. 2006 Hum Gen Ther 17: 167-176; Chevez- Barrios P et al. 2005 J Clin Oncol 23: 7927-7935]. Since levels of heparan sulfate are increased in diseased retina [Landers RA et al. 1994 J Neurochem 63: 737-750], the vectors described in this report may have application for the treatment of a variety of retinal degenerations.\n\n\nSeveral cell-penetrating peptides have microbicidal action and have structural and chemical similarities with naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides [Jung HJ et al. 2006 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 345: 222-228; Zhu WL et al. 2006 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 349: 769-774; Palm C et al. 2006 Peptides 27: 1710-1716]. HIV TAT at concentrations of 3-24 μM has antifungal activity association with peptide binding nucleic acids and disrupting the cell cycle [Jung HJ et al. 2006 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 345: 222-228]. Similarly, Pep-l-K, an analogue of Pep- 1 designed specifically to target microbes, was strongly antibacterial in cultures of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with a \n\n minimal inhibitory concentration of 1-2 μM [Zhu WL et al. 2006 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 349: 769-774]. POD similar to Pep-l-K significantly reduced the number of gram- negative bacteria in culture, and significant reductions in colony number were seen herein with much lower concentrations of POD than was reported with the other peptides. A concentration as low as 0.3 μM was sufficient to reduce E. coli survival, a valuable finding as lower doses of POD are likely to be more clinically applicable. Injections of POD conjugated to therapeutic agents could possibly provide additional prophylaxis against infections resulting from invasive clinical procedures. Furthermore, POD antimicrobial activities indicate that POD is a therapeutic agent in an uncomplexed form. Several recent studies have shown promise in the use of gene therapy for the correction of a wide range of disorders including ocular disease. The majority of these studies employ viral vectors for gene delivery and have shown effective rescue of mouse models across a wide spectrum of disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa [AIi RR et al. 2000 Nat Genet 25: 306-310; Takahashi M et al. 1999 J Virol 73: 7812-7816; Bennett J 2000 Curr Opin MoI Ther 2: 420- 425] , Leber' s congenital amaurosis (LCA) [Acland GM et al. 2001 Nat Genet 2001 ; 28 : 92-95 ; Le Meur G et al. 2007 Gene Ther 14: 292-303; Narfstrom K et al. 2003 Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 44: 1663-1672; Dejneka NS et al. 2003 Adv Exp Med Biol 533: 415-422] and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) [Reich SJ et al. 2003 Curr Opin Genet Dev 13: 317-322]. However, adverse effects of viral application, including insertional mutagenesis and oncogenicity [Baum C et al. 2006 Hum Gene Ther 17: 253-263], as well as inflammation and immunogenicity [Muruve DA 2004 Hum Gene Ther 15: 1157-1166; Reichel MB et al. 1998 Gene Ther 5: 1038-1046], limit their application. Other concerns such as limitation of transgene size [Verma IM et al. 1997 Nature 389: 239-242] and the development of neutralizing antibodies [Bennett J et al. 1999 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96: 9920-9925] also restrict their use.\n\n\nThere is substantial interest in the development of non- viral vectors, yet previous efforts have been hampered by a lack of efficiency in vivo. The eye is an ideal organ for studying gene delivery vectors due to a wide variety of characterized diseases, compartmentalized structure and post-mitotic cell population [Bainbridge JW et al. 2006 Gene Ther 13: 1191-1197]. Cell culture transfection techniques such as electroporation [Bainbridge JW et al. 2006 Gene Ther 13: 1191-1197; Kachi S et al. 2005 Gene Ther 12: 843-851; Bejjani RA et al. 2007 Surv Ophthalmol 52: 196-208], cationic lipids [Kachi S et al. 2005 Gene Ther 12: 843-851; Brown MD et al. 2001 Int J Pharm 229: 1-21], and synthetic polymers such polyethylenimine [Godbey WT et al. 2001 Biomaterials 22: 471-480; Bieber T et al. 2002 J \n\n Control Release 82: 441-454] modified for ocular use in vivo have shown some evidence of efficacy but these techniques often result in significant toxicity.\n\n\nSmall positively charged peptides have been shown to bind DNA and to protect plasmids from degradation [Ziady AG et al. 2003 MoI Ther 8: 936-947; Thomas M et al. 2003 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 62: 27-34]. A pegylated lysine 30-mer (CK30PEG) was first shown to transfect slowly dividing cells in the lung [Ziady AG et al. 2003 MoI Ther 8: 936-947] and later demonstrated efficacy in post-mitotic ocular tissue [Farjo R et al. 2006 PLoS ONE 1 : e38]. Another promising strategy employs a group of short positively charged proteins, known as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), that can cross the plasma membrane and have been shown to deliver biologically active molecules in vivo and in vitro [Lindgren M et al. 2000 Trends Pharmacol Sci 21 : 99-103]. The results of CPP experiments suggest that they have a number of advantages over viral vector delivery, including ease of preparation, rapid uptake, and low toxicity and immune response [Jones SW et al. 2005 Br J Pharmacol 145: 1093-1102]. HIV Tat is a CPP that has been shown to compact DNA and deliver it to cells in culture [Ignatovich IA et al. 2003 J Biol Chem 278: 42625-42636]. However, there has been little evidence of successful gene transfer using CPPs alone in vivo [Lindgren M et al. 2000 Trends Pharmacol Sci 21: 99-103].\n\n\nIt is shown herein that a novel synthetic cationic peptide referred to as POD, or \"protein for ocular delivery,\" is able to penetrate the plasma membrane and deliver DNA and RNA in vitro [Johnson LN et al. 2008 MoI Ther 16: 107-114]. These results show that POD is able to deliver small and large molecules in vitro which could make it an ideal candidate for DNA delivery in vivo.\n\n\nThere are a number of barriers to gene delivery in vivo: stability in the extracellular space, transportation across the plasma membrane, escape from endosomes, and finally translocation across the nuclear pore. To this aim, POD was investigated for its ability to deliver DNA into the nucleus of post-mitotic cells in vivo by effectively overcoming these obstacles. Examples herein indicate that pegylated POD, TAT, and polylysine can transfect cells in vivo at higher levels than plasmid alone and appear to show differential efficacies in vivo. These findings highlight the use of pegylated cell penetrating peptides as novel gene delivery vectors.\n\n\nSeveral recent studies have shown promise in the use of gene therapy for the correction of a wide range of disorders including ocular disease.

Johnson, Siobhan M. Cashman and Rajendra Kumar-Singh, in the journal Molecular Therapy, 2007, 116:107-114 subsequent to the filing of U.S. provisional application 60/966,591. Additional examples are found herein and in a paper entitled, \"Cell Penetrating Peptide POD Mediates Delivery of Recombinant Proteins to Retina, Cornea and Skin\" by these authors 2008, submitted to the journal Molecular Therapy, and which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, that the peptides of this invention can be obtained from a peptide synthesizer or any commercial supplier of custom peptides produced synthetically, e.g., by solid phase procedures. For example, peptide synthesis can be performed using various solid-phase techniques [Roberge et al. 995 Science 269:202] and automated synthesis may be achieved, for example, using the 43 IA peptide synthesizer (available from Applied Biosystems of Foster City, CA) in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions \n\n In one aspect of the present invention, pharmaceutical compositions are provided, such that these compositions include a peptide covalently linked to a target molecule of choice, and optionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In certain embodiments, these compositions optionally further comprise one or more additional therapeutic agents. In certain embodiments, the target of choice and/or the additional therapeutic agent or agents are selected from the group of growth factors, anti-inflammatory agents, vasopressor agents, collagenase inhibitors, topical steroids, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, ascorbates, angiotensin II, angiotensin III, calreticulin, tetracyclines, fibronectin, collagen, thrombospondin, transforming growth factors (TGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), insulin-like growth factors (IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), neu differentiation factor (NDF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), B vitamins such as biotin, and hyaluronic acid.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" includes any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicle, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the particular dosage form desired. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences Ed. by Gennaro, Mack Publishing, Easton, PA, 1995 describes a variety of different carriers that are used in formulating pharmaceutical compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof. Some examples of materials that are pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, sugars such as glucose, and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.\n\n\nTherapeutically effective dose\n\n\nIn yet another aspect, the methods of treatment of the present invention include the treatment of an ocular condition or a condition affecting another organ or tissue by contacting, \n\n for example, the eye with a pharmaceutical composition described herein. Thus, the invention provides methods for the treatment of the ocular condition comprising administering to a subject in need thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising active agents that include the peptide conjugate, in such amounts and for such time as is necessary to achieve the desired result. It will be appreciated that this encompasses administering an inventive pharmaceutical as a therapeutic measure to promote the spreading of tear film onto the corneal and conjunctival surface, or as a prophylactic measure to minimize complications associated with the ocular condition (e.g., as a wound irrigation solution during and/or following surgery or treatment of inflammatory conditions with anti-histamines). In certain embodiments of the present invention a \"therapeutically effective amount\" of the pharmaceutical composition is that amount effective for promoting healing and/or improvement of the condition. The compositions, according to the method of the present invention, may be administered using any amount and any route of administration effective for treating the cell, tissue or organ. Thus, the expression \"amount effective for promoting the treating the condition\", as used herein, refers to a sufficient amount of composition to promote the healing and return to normal of physiology of the cell, tissue or organ. The exact dosage is chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient to be treated. Dosage and administration are adjusted to provide sufficient levels of the active agent(s) or to maintain the desired effect. Additional factors which may be taken into account include the severity of the disease state, e.g., extent of the condition, history of the condition; age, weight and gender of the patient; diet, time and frequency of administration; drug combinations; reaction sensitivities; and tolerance/response to therapy. Long acting pharmaceutical compositions might be administered several time points a day, every day, 3 to 4 days, every week, or once every two weeks depending on half-life and clearance rate of the particular composition. The active agents of the invention are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The expression \"dosage unit form\" as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of active agent appropriate for the patient to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. For any active agent, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays or in animal models, as shown in examples herein, usually mice, rabbits, dogs, or pigs. The animal model is also used to achieve a desirable concentration range and route of administration. While direct application to the eye is envisioned as the route of administration, such information can then be used to determine useful doses and \n\n additional routes for administration in humans. A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of active agent that ameliorates the symptoms or condition. Therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of active agents can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., ED50 (the dose that is therapeutically effective in 50% of the population) and LD50 (the dose that is lethal to 50% of the population). The dose ratio of toxic to therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, and it can be expressed as the ratio, LD50/ED50. Pharmaceutical compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies are used in formulating a range of dosages for human use.\n\n\nAdministration of pharmaceutical compositions\n\n\nAfter formulation with an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in a desired dosage, the pharmaceutical compositions herein are administered to humans and other mammals topically such as ocularly (as by powders, ointments, or drops), i.e., as applied directly to the eye. Alternative additional routes such as oral, rectal, parenteral, intracisternal, intravaginal, intraperitoneal, bucal, or nasal, depending on the severity of the condition being treated, are envisioned.\n\n\nLiquid dosage forms for ocular administration include buffers and solubilizing agents, preferred diluents such as water, preservatives such as thymosol, and one or more biopolymers or polymers for conditioning the solution, such as polyethylene glycol, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium hyaluronate, sodium polyacrylate or tamarind gum.\n\n\nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include, without limitation, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active agent(s), the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.\n\n\nDosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of the pharmaceutical compositions herein include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions,\n\n\n2fi \n\n sprays, inhalants, or patches. The active agent is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and preservatives or buffers as may be required. For example, ocular or cutaneous infections may be treated with aqueous drops, a mist, an emulsion, or a cream. Administration may be therapeutic or it may be prophylactic. Prophylactic formulations are applied to the site of potential wounds, or to sources of wounds, such as contact lenses, contact lens cleaning and rinsing solutions, containers for contact lens storage or transport, devices for contact lens handling, eye drops, surgical irrigation solutions, ear drops, eye patches, and cosmetics for the eye area, including creams, lotions, mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow, and to ophthalmological devices, surgical devices, audiological devices or products that contain the compositions herein (e.g., gauze bandages or strips), and methods of making or using such devices or products. These devices may be coated with, impregnated with, bonded to or otherwise treated with a composition herein.\n\n\nThe ointments, pastes, creams, and gels may contain, in addition to an active agent of this invention, excipients such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc, zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof.\n\n\nPowders and sprays can contain, in addition to the agents of this invention, excipients such as talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates, polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons.\n\n\nTransdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of the active ingredients to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.\n\n\nInjectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as solvents or suspending media. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of \n\n injectables. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. In order to prolong the in vivo effect of an active agent, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the agent from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Delayed absorption of a parenterally administered active agent may be accomplished by dissolving or suspending the agent in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the agent in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide- polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of active agent to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of active agent release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the agent in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.\n\n\nCompositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the active agent(s) of compositions herein with suitable non- irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active agent(s).\n\n\nSolid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active agent is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\nSolid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard- filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release \n\n controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active agent(s) may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose or starch. Such dosage forms may also include, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also include buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active agent(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe following materials and reagents were used throughout the examples herein. Materials and reagents.\n\n\nHeparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, Propidium iodide were purchased from Sigma. GFP Duplex I was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and pd2-EGFPNI was from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). N terminal conjugated peptides (lissamine, biotin, cysteine) with GGG(ARKKAAKA)\n4\n were custom synthesized and HPLC purified by Sigma Genosys (Woodlands, TX). N terminal FITC conjugated GGG(ARKKAAKA)\n4\n was synthesized by the University of Utah peptide facility. All other commercially available materials and reagents, including the QdOt\n655\n Streptavidin conjugate, were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CAl unless otherwise noted.\n\n\nCell penetrating properties of POD\n\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all experiments were performed at least twice in triplicate. HER cells were seeded on Lab Tek-II chamber slides and grown to -70% confluence. Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 1 nmole L-POD for 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes or lnmol Lissamine only for 60 minutes. Cells were fixed for 15 minutes in formalin at room temperature. Cells for live imaging were grown on 24 well plates and incubated with 2 nmoles of L-POD. Following incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Cells were visualized by light and fluorescent microscopy using either an Olympus 1X51 (live cells) or an Olympus BX51 (fixed cells) with DIC, RFP, and GFP filters. Images were obtained using a Retiga 2000R FAST camera and QCapture Pro 5.0 (Qlmaging, BC, Canada). To measure L-POD uptake in the presence of trypsin, 0.2 x 10\n6\n HER cells were incubated with 2.0 nmole L-POD in media for 15\n\n\n?Q \n\n minutes at 37°C followed by incubation in 2.5 mg/ml trypsin for 12 minutes at 37°C. For analysis of uptake at 4°C, cells were cooled to 4 °c for 45 minutes prior to the addition of peptide and cold (4°C) reagents were used for peptide administration. Following incubation with peptide, cells were washed twice with PBS and spun and resuspended in PBS for FACS analysis. For measurement of membrane permeabilization, HER cells were incubated with 2.0 nmole FITC-HBP for 30 minutes at 37° C, washed twice, isolated, and suspended in PBS with 1 μM PI. The number of Pi-positive cells was analyzed by FACS. FACS analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). Experiments were performed in triplicate and 10,000 events per sample were counted. Results were analyzed using CellQuest Pro software (Becton Dickinson).\n\n\nPOD mediated delivery of siRNA. DNA and quantum dots in vitro pCAGRFP was compacted with C-POD at a ratio of 400 peptide/plasmid molecules. Briefly, 2 ~g of DNA and the appropriate concentration of peptide were each suspended in 15 ~L of either 100 μM sodium phosphate or 5% dextrose buffer. The peptide and DNA solutions were mixed and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature prior to addition to HER cells. After 48 hours, cells were resuspended in PBS for FACS analysis. For electron microscopy, peptide/DNA complexes were prepared as above. Particles were bound to glow-discharged copper grids, stained with urinyl acetate, and visualized on a CMIO Transmission Electron Microscope (Philips) using Digital Micrograph software (Gatan, Inc). C-POD was used to compact both pd2-EGFP-NI and GFP Duplex I at concentrations of 450 particles/DNA molecule and 25 particles/duplex molecule, respectively, in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer using the same procedures described above. 2 μg of compacted pd2 -EGFP-NI DNA and 70 pmoles of GFP Duplex I diluted in DMEM + 2% FBS were added simultaneously to HER cells for 4 hours. Growing medium was then added to cells and the incubation continued for 44 additional hours. Cells were isolated and resuspended in PBS for FACS analysis as described above. For delivery of quantum dots, 50 pmoles of a Qdot655 streptavidin conjugate (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were added to 5 nmoles of Biotin- conjugated POD (B-POD) in PBS and mixed for I hour by gentle rocking at room temperature. The Qdot-peptide complex (QDPOD) was dialyzed in PBS using a 50 K Ultrafree (Millipore) column and added to 0.2 x 106 HER cells for either 15 minutes or two hours. The amount of fluorescence resulting from the Qdot-peptide complex was determined using a fluorometer and an equivalent amount of unbound Strep-Qdot was added separately as control. Cells were washed three times with PBS, \n\n fixed as described above, and stained with DAPI. Uptake of Qdots was determined by fluorescent microscopy as described above.\n\n\nInhibition of POD uptake by proteoglycans and POD-associated microbicidal activity Lissamine conjugated POD (L-POD) and either heparan sulfate or chondroitan sulfate were incubated together at molar ratios of 1 :3.33, 1.6.67, and 1 :8 in water for 30 minutes at room temperature. The complex was diluted in DMEM + 2% FBS and added to 0.2 X ]06 HER cells for 5 minutes at 37°C. Following incubation, cells were trypsinized and suspended in PBS for FACS analysis as described above. To measure microbicidal activity of C-POD, XL-I Blue cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were grown to mid logarithmic phase (OD600 = 0.600) and washed twice in a solution of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 and 5 mM Glucose. The cells were resuspended in 10 mL of the same solution and 5 mL of the suspension was incubated with C- POD in a final volume of 50 μL. The peptide/bacteria cell solution was rocked for 2 hours at 37° C. The peptide-treated bacteria was diluted 1 :4500 with LB Broth, plated on agar, and grown overnight at 370 C. The following day, the bacterial colonies on each plate were counted to quantify peptide-related reduction in growth.\n\n\nPOD-mediated delivery of molecules to ocular tissues in vivo\n\n\nThe use of animals in this work was in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories, bred and maintained in a 12-hour light-dark cycle and cared for in accordance with federal, state and local regulations. For each experiment at least 4 mice (8 eyes) were investigated, yielding roughly similar results. Mice were anesthetized by intravitreal injection of xylazine (10 mg/ml)/ketamine (1 mg/ml). Subretinal or intravitreal injections were performed with a 32G needle attached to a 5 μl glass syringe (Hamilton) by a trans scleral trans choroidal approach to deliver 0.25 nmole of L-POD per eye. For topical delivery to cornea, male C57BL6/6J mice at 6 weeks of age were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine and 10 nmoles of either L-POD or lissamine only were dropped on the cornea and incubated for 45 minutes or 24 hours. Upon completion of the treatment, the animal was sacrificed by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation and the eyes harvested and washed three times in PBS. Fluorescent and bright field images were taken of each eye using a Nikon C-FMC microscope prior to fixation. Eyes were fixed overnight at 4° C in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature Compound and 14 μm sections were collected using a Microm 550 cryostat. \n\n Adenovirus constructs and glvcosaminoglycan blocking\n\n\nConstructs Ad5pIXPODs and Ad5pIXPODsΔRGD were generated in two steps by modification of pShuttle [He et al. (1998) Prόc Natl Acad Sci USA 95: 2509-2514] such that the stop codon was replaced by synthetic oligonucleotides:\n\n\n5 '\n\n\nTGAGC 3 '(SEQ ID NO:9), and\n\n\n5 '\n\n\nAGCTT GG 3 ' , (SEQ ID NO: 10), resulting in a pIX-PODs fusion. These recombinant shuttle plasmids were recombined with either pAdEasy-1 [He et al. 1998 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95: 2509-2514] or with pAdEasy-1 containing a deletion in the RGD domain of penton base. The resultant viruses were purified using the Adenopure kit (Puresyn, Inc, Malvern, PA). To measure the effect of proteoglycans on the above viruses, they were incubated with either heparan sulphate or chondroitan sulphate\n\n\n8 prior to addition to Chang C or 911 cells. A total of each of 1 x 10 particles of AdCAGGFP, Ad5pIXPODs or Ad5pIXPODsΔRGD were incubated with 16 nmoles of either heparan sulphate or chondroitan sulphate at room temperature for 30 minutes. The virus-peptide mixture was added to cells in experimental medium at a final multiplicity of infection of (moi) 500. Forty-eight hours following infection, cells were isolated and resuspended in PBS for FACS analysis.\n\n\nCell culture and transfection\n\n\nHuman embryonic retinoblast (HER) cells were cultured using previously described methods [Fallaux FJ et al. 1996 Hum.Gene Ther. 7: 215-222]. Carcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown to 70-80 % confluence in DMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All experimental cell culture procedures were performed in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Transfection of plasmids was carried out using 2:1 μl Lipofectamine: μg plasmid in Opti- MEM media. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were fixed and stained with 4',6- diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).\n\n\nPlasmid and adenovirus construction\n\n\nOligonucleotides POD-upper and POD-lower coding for the POD protein transduction domain were cloned into SacI/EcoRI digested pQBI25fAl (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) to generate pPODGFP. pPODGFPHis and pGFPHis were cloned by inserting the \n\n oligonucleotides His-upper and His-lower into Clal/Mlul digested pPODGFP and pQBI25fAl, respectively as shown herein. pPODGFPHis and pGFPHis were digested with BgIII and Xmnl and ligated with Bglll/EcoRV-digested pShuttle. The corresponding pShuttle plasmids were linearized with Pmel, gel purified, and cotransfected with pAdEasy-linto E. coli BJ5183 cells. Recombinant plasmids were digested with Pad and transfected into HER cells.\n\n\nAdPODGFPHis and AdGFPHis were isolated using a virus purification kit (Puresyn, Malvern, PA).\n\n\nPOD -upper : GCCACCATGGCTCGTAAGAAGGCTGCTAAGGCTGCCCGCAAGAAGGCTGCCAAGGCCGCACGAAAGAAGGCAGCAA AGGCGGCTCGTAAGAAGGCTGCCAAGGCGTC (SEQIDNO:5)\n\n\nPOD-lower:\n\n\nGCAGCCTTAGCAGCCTTCTTACGAGCCATGGTGGCGC (SEQ ID NO:6) His tag-upper: CGATCATCATCACCATCACCATTGA (SEQ ID NO:7) His tag-lower: CGCGTCAATGGTGATGGTGATGATGAT (SEQ ID NO:8)\n\n\nThe sequences indicated in bold are POD and His tag specifically.\n\n\nProtein isolation and purification\n\n\nHER cells were infected with either AdPODGFPHis or AdGFPHis at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 200 viral particles/cell. Cells were harvested when greater than 90% of cells were GFP-positive as determined by fluorescence microscopy which occurred approximately 96 hours post-infection. The cytoplasm and nucleus were isolated and lysed for protein purification using the NuCLEAR Extraction Kit (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Fusion proteins were isolated using the His-Select kit (Sigma) and 250 mM imidazole according to manufacturer's instructions. The final protein eluates were dialyzed in PBS using a 1OK\n\n\nUltrafree column (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Protein concentrations were measured using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). To eliminate the potential of virus contamination in the protein prep, fusion proteins were heated to 7O\n0\nC for five minutes to inactivate any residual virus, and were tested for cytopathic effect in HER cells.\n\n\nCellular uptake and localization of PODGFPHis\n\n\nTo evaluate cellular penetration of POD fusion proteins, HER cells were seeded on Lab Tek-II chamber slides and incubated with 10 μg of POD-GFP or GFP for two hours. Following fixation, cells were visualized by light and fluorescence microscopy using an Olympus BX51 microscope with differential interference contrast (DIC) and the appropriate fluorescence filters. Images were captured using a Retiga 2000R FAST camera and QCapture \n\n W\n\n\nPro 5.0 (Qlmaging, British Columbia, Canada). To quantitate protein uptake, 0.2x10\n6\n of either HER or A549 cells were incubated with 10 μg POD-GFP or GFP for 2 hours. Cells were washed with PBS, pelleted and resuspended in PBS for FACS analysis. Cell membrane integrity was evaluated by measuring the percentage of Propidium Iodide (1 μM) positive cells in the presence of fusion protein. FACS analysis of protein uptake and toxicity was performed using a FACSCAlibur (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and results analyzed using CellQuest Pro (Becton Dickinson). 10,000 events were counted for each experiment, which was performed in triplicate and repeated.\n\n\nHER and A549 cells were treated as above for subsequent addition of LysoTracker, ER Tracker (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA), or DAPI, and were incubated for one hour. These reagents were removed and cells were fixed with formalin for imaging.\n\n\nSilver staining and Western blotting\n\n\nFor protein analysis 1 μg of POD-GFP and 250 ng of recombinant GFP were loaded onto a 12 % Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad). Silver staining was carried out using Silver Stain Plus Kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes, which were probed for GFP expression using anti-AFP 5001 11E5 monoclonal antibody (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. The signal was detected using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL)\n\n\nDelivery of POD-GFPHis to ocular tissues in vivo\n\n\nThe use of animals in this study was in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Opthalmic and Vision Research. Subretinal and intravitreal injections of the fusion proteins were performed using techniques described in Cashman et al. 2006 Invest\n\n\nOpthalmol Vis Sci 47:3496-3504. Briefly, 8.5 μg of POD-GFP or 6.6 μg of GFP protein was injected into the subretinal or intravitreal space respectively, of 6-8 week old C57BL/6J mice. Four independent injections were performed and yielded nearly identical results. Six hours post-injection, mice were sacrificed by CO\n2\n inhalation and cervical dislocation. For topical delivery of the POD-GFPHis or GFP-His, C57BL/6J mice were anesthetized with xylazine/ketamine and 2 μl containing 40 μg of protein were dropped onto the corneal surface. Forty-five minutes following administration, mice were sacrificed as above and eyes enucleated, washed twice in PBS, and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. Eyes were\n\n\nI A \n\n embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature Compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and 14 μm sections were collected using a Microm 550 cryostat.\n\n\nTransdermal application Adult mice were anesthetized as described above and the abdomen shaved to reveal a\n\n\n2.25 cm\n2\n area of skin. A dose of 40 μg of protein was applied to the skin for 24 hours. Upon completion of the treatment, animals were sacrificed and the treated skin dissected and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and transverse sections were obtained as described herein.\n\n\nPlasmids. peptide and cell lines pCAGLuc was cloned by placing the Luciferase cDNA from pGL3 -Control (Promega) into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) using HindIII and Xbal. An XhoIINotI fragment of this plasmid was inserted into pCAGEN (kindly provided by C. Cepko). A Smal/Notl fragment of pCMVb (Clontech) was cloned into EcoR V/Notl-digesXcd pCAGEN to generate pCAGLacZ. Plasmid pCAGGFP was generously provided by C. Cepko. Cpod,\n\n\nCGGG(ARKKAAKA)\n4\n was generated at Tufts University Peptide Synthesis Core Facility and purified by HPLC. Both lung epithelial A549 cells (ATCC) and human embryonic retinoblasts (HER; Fallaux et al 1996) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen).\n\n\nIn vivo delivery of POD/DNA complexes\n\n\nExperiments involving animals were performed in accordance with the Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research, set out by the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology. C57BL/6J and BALB/CJ mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and maintained in 12-hour dark light cycles in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of xylazine (10mg/ml)/ketamine (lmg/ml). Subretinal injections were performed with a 32G needle (Becton Dickinson) and a 5μl glass syringe (Hamilton) by a trαws-scleral trans-choτoida\\ approach. Animals were sacrificed by CO\n2\n inhalation followed by cervical dislocation.\n\n\ncPOD/DNA compaction: in vitro and in vivo delivery pCAGGFP or pCAGLuc were compacted using cPOD as previously described [Johnson L et al. 2007 MoI Therapy 16: 107-114]. Briefly, 1.8 nMoles of cPOD were used to compact 2μg of DNA (Nitrogen:Phosphate (N/P) ratio of 8.6) in sodium phosphate (100 \n\n mmol/1) and added to the media of 2x10\n5\n A549 cells. In serum starvation conditions the cells were incubated with serum free DMEM for 24 hours prior to transfection. After 48 hours, cells were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for FACS analysis of GFP or prepared for luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Live cells were visualized with light and fluorescent microscopy using an Olympus 1X51 with differential interference contrast and appropriate fluorescent filters. Images were captured using a Retiga 2000R FAST camera and QCapture Pro 5.0 (Qlmaging, British Columbia, Canada). FACS analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed using CellQuest Pro software (Becton Dickinson). Experiments were done in triplicate and 15,000 events were recorded per sample. For use in explants and in vivo injection, cPOD/DNA complexes were prepared as above at 4.3 and 8.6 N:P ratios. Explants were prepared from 6-8 week old C57 wild type mice by enucleation and removal of the anterior chamber. The retina and RPE/sclera were separated, flattened and placed in 500μL 5% CO\n2\n equilibriated DMEM with 10% FBS and 100U/mL Pen-Strep. 2μg of compacted pCAGLuc or the plasmid alone was added to explants and incubated for 48 hours (4.3 N:P ratio n=8, 8.6 N:P ratio n=3). For injections in vivo, 0.2μg of compacted DNA or naked DNA was injected subretinally (all conditions n=4). The eyes were harvested 48 hours later and the anterior chamber removed. In both explants and in vivo injections, tissue was homogenized using a VWR PowerMax AHS 200 homogenizer in homogenization buffer (5OmM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 15OmM NaCl) and assayed for luciferase expression according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega) using a Glomax 20/20 luminometer (Promega). Protein concentration was measured using Quick Start Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) and comparing to bovine serum albumin (Bio-Rad) standards in corresponding buffer.\n\n\nPreparation and characterization of PEGylated cPOD, TAT and CK30 nanoparticles\n\n\nTo PEGylate, the peptide was resuspended in 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 5mM EDTA to form a 20mg/ml solution. An equimolar amount of methoxy-PEG-maleimide — 1OkD (Nektar Transforming Therapeutics) was resuspended in the same volume of DMSO. PEG was added dropwise to the peptide over ~10 minutes, vortexing between drops. The solution was shaken overnight at room temperature, and dialyzed using a Bio-gel P6 column (Bio-Rad) into 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for POD and TAT and 5OmM ammonium acetate for CK30 [Ziady AG et al. 2003 MoI Ther 8: 936-947]. The pegylated POD (PEG-POD) was quantified by Coomassie stain of a Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) using a cPOD standard curve. Both CK30 and TAT are not within the detectable limits of Coomassie stain, so protein concentration was\n\n\n16 \n\n performed using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific) using the un-PEGylated peptide to create a standard curve. DNA was compacted by diluting the plasmid in water to a final concentration of 0.2μg/μl and added dropwise to PEG-POD or PEG-TAT (final ratio 1.8nMole peptide:2μg DNA), vortexing to mix. The nanoparticles were dialyzed three times in 5% dextrose using Biomax 1OK centrifugal filter (Millipore) and stored at 4°C. PEG-CK30 particles were compacted following a previously described protocol [Ziady AG et al. 2003 MoI Ther 8: 936-947; Liu G et al. 2003 J Biol Chem 278: 32578-32586], but briefly, 0.9mL DNA(200μg/mL) was added to O.lmL of 7.1 mg/mL PEG-CK30 in O.lmL aliquots over ~2 minutes at 25°C. The compacted DNA was dialyzed overnight into 0.9% filtered NaCl at 4°C (Tube-O-Dialyzer, G-Biosciences, St.Louis, MO) and concentrated by centrifugation\n\n\n(Ultrafree, Millipore, NMWL 10OkD). Plasmid compaction for each peptide was verified by reduced mobility through a 1% agarose gel (Invitrogen), which was relieved after 15 minute incubation with 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen) at 37°C. PEG-POD articles were analyzed by incubation on glow-discharged Formvar copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences), stained with 0.4% uranyl acetate, and visualized using CMlO Transmission Electron Microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) using Digital Micrograph software (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA). PEG-POD particles and control samples were diluted to 0.2mg/ml and analyzed at 25°C using a BIC BI- 200 SM research goniometer and laser light scattering system (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, Holtsville, NY) with 532nm laser light. Data was collected for 5 minutes for each , sample and the mean particle diameter determined by quadratic fit using software supplied by the manufacturer.\n\n\nLocalization of compacted DNA in vitro and in vivo\n\n\nRhodamine labeled DNA (pGeneGrip, Gene Therapy Systems) was compacted with either cPOD or PEG-POD as described. Compactions were added to HER cells grown to -80% confluency on Lab Tek-II chamber slides in serum free DMEM to a final concentration of 0.66 μg/ml and incubated at 37\n0\nC, 5% CO\n2\n for 24 hours (for each condition, n=4). Cells were fixed with 4% formalin for 15 minutes at room temperature. For localization in vivo 0.1 μg of the compacted plasmid was injected subretinally into 6-8 week C57 mice, harvested after two hours and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldahyde. Eyes were dehydrated, embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature Compound (Sakura) and 14μm sections collected using a Microm 550 cryostat. Imaging was performed as above using an Olympus BX51 microscope (for each condition, n=4). \n\n PEG-peptide/DNA nanoparticle transfections in vivo\n\n\nSubretinal injections were performed as above and luciferase activity assayed as for cPOD compactions. All injections were performed in a 2μL total volume. For uninjected, DNA only and 0.6μg POD, n=4, for 1.2μg POD n=8, for 1.2μg TAT and CK30 n=6. For tail vein injections, compacted or naked DNA was injected in a total volume of 200μl with 0.01% fast green (Fisher) using a 25G needle (Becton Dickinson). For uninjected n=2, for 40μg naked DNA n=6, for lOμg PEG.-POD~Luc n=3, for 40μg PEG-POD~Luc n=4. 48 hours after injection, mice were sacrificed using CO\n2\n, perfused with 800μl PBS through the left ventricle. The organs were harvested, placed in 500μl Luciferase Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega) with 20 μl/ml of a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and homogenized for 20 seconds.\n\n\nHomogenates were centrifuged at 4°C for 10 minutes at 12,000 x g and assayed for luciferase activity as per manufacturer's instructions (Promega) and protein concentration as mentioned above. Standard curve values for the luminometer were determined using QuntiLum Recombinant Luciferase (Promega). Conversion from relative light units (RLU) to pg was calculated as: luciferase (pg) = (3.696xlO\n~5\n x RLU) - 0.0815 (R\n2\n=0.9999). For β-galactosidase expression, 1.2μg of either compacted or naked pCAGLacZ was injected subretinally in BALB/CJ mice. After 48 hours, eyes were enucleated and fixed in 0.25% glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes. The eyes were incubated in X-GaI Working Solution (0.75mL 40mg/ml X-GaI (Fisher) in dimethylformamide, 1.5ml 2Ox KC solution [0.82g K\n3\nFe(CN)\n6\n, 1.05g K\n4\nFe(CN)\n6\n- 3H\n2\nO], 0.015ml IM MgCl\n2\n, 28ml PBS) for 16-18 hours and then rinsed in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 45 minutes. The eyes were fixed for 24 hours in 4% PFA, dehydrated, embedded andlδμm sections were collected. Whole eye bright-field images were taken using a C-FMC microscope prior to sectioning. For all conditions, n=4.\n\n\nDNA stability assay in presence of serum\n\n\nPEG-POD 700ng compacted or naked pCAGLuc (700ng) was treated with 2.5U or 0.25U DNaseI (Sigma) at 37°C for 15 minutes, after which lOμg pronase (Sigma) was added and incubated for a further 10 minutes at 37°C. The samples were then analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis to check for DNA degradation.\n\n\nElectroretinographv\n\n\nMice were injected subretinally with lμl of PEG-POD~Luc nanoparticles (700ng) or lμl of 5% dextrose buffer and analyzed by electroretinography (ERG) 48 hours later as\n\n\n^R \n\n follows: After overnight dark-adaptation, the mice were anaesthetized as described above, pupils dilated with 1% tropicamide (Akorn, Inc), and scotopic ERGs recorded at 3 different light intensities (-2 to OdB) using contact lens electrodes and the UTAS system with BigShot ganzfeld (LKC Technologies, Inc). For each animal, 5-10 flashes were averaged for the high- low intensities. For all conditions, n=4.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\n\n\nThe data are presented as the log-transformed mean + SEM. Data analyses were done using Prism Software 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). During analysis of the data, there was shown to be a highly significant difference (pO.OOOl) between the variances of the data sets that was mean dependent. This precludes analysis by Student's /-test, which assumes equal variances between samples. The data (RLU/mg) was logarithmically transformed to create a more Gaussian distribution, eliminating the variability between data set variance, and allowing use of the parametric t test [Armitage P et al. 2002 J.N.S. Statistical Methods in Medical Research. Blackwell Science, London]. Subretinal injections are a variable technique and we wanted to differentiate failed from successful injections. Since these experiments demonstrated that the raw RLU increases above background, we took this to mean that during a successful injection the RLU should rise, even if only by a small margin, by three standard deviations above the mean when a blank alone was measured [Ziady AG et al. 2003 MoI Therapy 8: 936- 947]. While all data points are shown, only those above blank + 3 SD are used in the statistical analysis and to calculate the means.\n\n\nExample 1. POD is a cell penetrating, non membrane-permeabilizing peptide\n\n\nHuman embryonic retinal (HER) 911 cells [Fallaux FJ et al. 1996 Hum.Gene Ther. 7: 215-222] incubated with 2 nmoles (8 μM) lissamine-conjugated POD (L-POD), followed by formalin fixation, became opaque to 558nm excitation (emission measured at 583nm) within 1 min and appeared normal in bright field (Figure 1 panel A). Within 5 min, L-POD was seen within the cytoplasm with both a diffuse cytoplasmic and slightly punctate pattern (Figure panel A). The majority of cells showed cytoplasmic staining after 60 min. Furthermore, there was no evidence of uptake of lissamine only (inset, Figure 1 panel A). Cells that were not fixed, i.e. live cells, showed a similar rate of L-POD uptake, and a pattern of localization that was almost exclusively punctate at both 15 min and 60 min. Again, there was no evidence of uptake of lissamine only (Figure 1 panel B).\n\n\nIQ \n\n To determine whether L-POD was internalized rather than non-specifically associated with the plasma membrane, HER cells incubated with 2 nmoles (8 μM) L-POD for 15 min were treated with trypsin at 37°C prior to counting of lissamine-positive cells by FACS. A total of 90.1 O± 1.89% or 92.23± 0.65% of cells were lissamine-positive with or without incubation with trypsin respectively (Figure 1 panel C), showing that the majority of L-POD was internalized and not merely membrane associated. Sensitivity of POD peptide to trypsin- mediated digestion was confirmed by incubation of 2.5 nmoles of C-POD with trypsin prior to loading on an acrylamidc gel (inset Figure 1 panel C). Whereas 92.23± 0.65% of HER cells were lissamine-positive when incubated with L-POD at 37°C, only 48.74± 2.32 % of cells were lissamine-positive when incubated with L-POD at 4°C (Figure 1 panel D). Hence, uptake of L-POD was found to be temperature dependent.\n\n\nIn order to determine whether uptake of POD required plasma membrane disruption, HER cells were incubated with increasing concentrations (ranging from 0.2 to 2.0 μM) of FITC-conjugated POD (F-POD) followed by a FACS measurement of the number of permeabilized cells by incubation with propidium iodide (PI). In this example F-POD rather than L-POD was utilized to reduce bleed of the lissamine-signal into that of PI. An average of 3.98±0.70% of cells were observed to be PI -positive when pre-incubated with F-POD, similar to the number of Pi-positive cells in the absence of any peptide- 5.18±3.00% (Figure 1 panel E). In contrast, 91.44± 9.66 % of the cells were Pi-positive when incubated with the cell permeabilizing detergent, 1% Triton-XIOO (Figure 1 panel E). These data show that F-POD enters HER cells without substantially disrupting the plasma membrane.\n\n\nExample 2. POD-mediated delivery of small and large molecules in cell culture\n\n\nPotential use of an N terminal biotinylated POD (B-POD) peptide or an N terminal cysteine-containing POD (C-POD) peptide in delivering small and relatively large molecules to cells in culture was examined. To establish proof-of-principle, the following target classes were examined herein: siRNA, plasmid DNA and streptavidin-coated CdSe quantum dots. The use of biotin provides for future conjugation of a large variety of biologically relevant compounds to POD via a streptavidin bridge, as is shown herein for quantum dots, or direct chemical linkage to cysteine is possible through the free sulfhydryl bond.\n\n\nIn initial examples, a 5.5 Kb plasmid containing a red fluorescent protein expression cassette (pCAGRFP) was complexed electrostatically with C-POD in 5% dextrose, incubated with HER 911 cells and analyzed by FACS 48 hours later. It was observed herein that pCAGRFP alone or pCAGRFP complexed with C-POD resulted in only 2.45± 0.31% and \n\n 2.20± 0.46% RFP-positive cells respectively (Figure 2 panel A). In contrast, when pCAGRFP was complexed with C-POD in Na2HP0\n4\n buffer, 55.58±8.23% of HER cells were observed to be RFP-positive cells (Figure 2 panel A) indicating that C-POD and the specific buffer were important components of the gene delivery complex. Examination of C-POD/pC AGRFP complexes in the two differently performing buffers by electron microscopy indicated that complexes prepared in Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n had an average area of 63.31 nm\n2\n, while those prepared in dextrose were 29.66 nm\n2\n (Figure 2 panel B). This difference may in part play a role in the different rates of gene transfer in the two buffers.\n\n\nC-POD was subsequently used to deliver a plasmid containing an expression cassette for green fluorescent protein (pEGFP) to HER cells, resulting in 49.13± 2.23% GFP-positive cells (Figure 2 panel C). Transfected cells were then incubated with either free siRNA duplex or with siRNA duplex complexed with C-POD, resulting in 39.86± 2.20% and 24.79± 1.18% GFP-positive cells respectively (Figure 2 panel C). These data show that delivery of siRNA by C-POD was enhanced over siRNA alone and that this approach may be a useful, non-toxic method for delivery of siRNA to enhance the knock down of gene expression.\n\n\nTo examine the potential of delivering larger cargo with POD, we conjugated B-POD with streptavidin coated quantum dots (QDPOD). HER cells incubated with QDPOD resulted in QDPOD-associated fluorescence within 15 min. QDPOD was also found in a punctate pattern within cells at 120 min (Figure 2 panel D). In contrast, streptavidin-coated quantum dots without B-POD were not taken up by HER cells (Figure 2 panel E).\n\n\nExample 3. Uptake of POD is inhibited by proteoglycans and POD has microbicidal activity\n\n\nTo determine whether L-POD uses cell surface proteoglycans for binding and cell entry, L-POD was pre incubated with varying ratios of either chondroitin sulfate or heparan sulfate prior to addition to HER cells. Based on data from preliminary studies, ratios of L- POD:proteoglycan of 1:3.33, 1:6.67 and 1 :8 were selected.\n\n\nWithout pre incubation of L-POD with any proteoglycan, 90.07± 0.64 % of cells were lissamine-positive, whereas increasing ratios of chondroitin sulfate led to a decrease in uptake of L-POD to 71.24± 1.77%, 59.43± 1.55%, and 34.38± 3.13% at 1 :3.33, 1 :6.67 and 1:8 molar ratios respectively (Figure 3 panel A). Similarly, pre incubation of L-POD with heparan sulfate reduced uptake to 78.60± 0.35%, 57.78± 2.83%, and 44.37± 2.17% respectively at the same ratios described above (Figure 3 panel A). In contrast, the uptake of a TRITC-conjugated peptide containing an integrin-binding RGD motif was not affected by pre-incubation with either proteoglycan (Figure 3 panel A). \n\n Since endophthalmitis, an infection within the eye, is regularly a complicating factor in drug delivery to ocular tissues [Ho J et al. 2007 Int Ophthalmol Clin 47: 199-208], we examined C-POD for potential microbicidal activities. E. coli cells grown to mid-log phase were incubated with either H20 only or C-POD suspended in H\n2\nO at concentrations ranging from 0.03 μM to 60 μM, and cell number was determined by plating samples on LB agar. Significant inhibition of bacterial growth was observed at C-POD concentrations of 0.30 μM (Figure 3 panel B) and almost complete inhibition at 24.0 μM C-POD. Greater concentrations of C-POD completely eliminated bacterial growth. Hence, we conclude that C-POD has microbicidal activity and that this activity is concentration dependent.\n\n\nExample 4. POD-mediated delivery of small and large molecules to retina in vivo Delivery of L-POD into the subretinal space (a space created between the photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) following delivery of fluids) of adult C57BL/6J mice followed by harvesting of tissue 2 hours later resulted in approximately 40% transduction of neural retina (Figure 4 panel A, magnification 4X). Within this region, there was substantial transduction of several layers of the retina including the RPE (Figure 4 panel A, magnification 20X). Closer examination reveals significant transduction of photoreceptor cell bodies, photoreceptor inner segments, cells in the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cells (Figure 4 panel A, magnification 40X). Although nuclei were not strongly positive in cell culture experiments described above, in vivo transduction of retina indicated that L-POD localized to nuclei in the case of RPE transduction (arrowheads, Figure 4 panel A, magnification 40X). As the nuclei of photoreceptor cells are large relative to the cell body, nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization could not be differentiated for those cells.\n\n\nDelivery of L-POD into the intravitreal space (the region between lens and retina) transduced approximately 85% of the neural retina (Figure 4 panel B, magnification 4X) within 2 hours. Strong staining was seen in the ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer and inner nuclear layer (Figure 4 panel B, magnification 20X). Closer examination revealed significant transduction of the ganglion cells and dendrites associated with the inner plexiform layer (arrowheads Figure 4 panel B, magnification 40X). There was no significant transduction of the outer layers of the retina by intravitreal injection at the 2 hour time point. Whether transduction of inner layers of the retina in addition to the outer layers following subretinal delivery was due to leakage of L-POD from the subretinal space into the vitreous or direct penetration of the retina by L-POD within 2 hours could not be determined. \n\n In contrast to L-POD, delivery of the significantly larger QDPOD complexes into the subretinal or intravitreal space appeared to permit cell binding but not uptake per se in the 2 hour time period following injection (Figure 4 panel C and 4 panel D). However, a longer incubation period of 20 hours revealed uptake of QDPOD into the outer nuclear layer following subretinal injection (Figure 4 panel C) or into the inner layers of the retina upon intravitreal injection (Figure 4 panel D).\n\n\nIn contrast, the control quantum dots that were coated with streptavidin only, showed only weak uptake by the RPE at 2hrs and slightly greater but still minimal uptake at 20hrs by the RPE (insets, Figure 4 panel C). Similarly, there were insignificant levels of uptake of control quantum dots upon intravitreal administration (insets, Figure panel D).\n\n\nExample 5. POD-mediated delivery of cargo to ocular tissues by topical application in vivo\n\n\nDelivery of drugs to ocular tissues via topical administration to the cornea is common practice, with drainage of large amounts of the drug occurring via the lacrimal ducts. In order to assess penetration of the cornea and sclera with L-POD, whole mouse eye was incubated in vivo with 10 nmol L-POD for 45 min followed by harvesting of ocular tissues.\n\n\nData observed show that within 45 min, L-POD bound strongly to the cornea, sclera and unexpectedly, also the optic nerve (Figure 5 panel A). In contrast, lissamine only weakly stained the cornea and sclera and did not stain the optic nerve (Figure 5 panel A). Frozen cross- sections of these eyes revealed that the entire outer ocular surface was positive for LPOD in contrast to lissamine, that only weakly stained these tissues (Figure 5 panel B). Closer examination of cornea and sclera indicated that there was strong staining of the corneal epithelium and sclera/choroid within this 45 min time period (Figure 5 panel C). Longitudinal and cross-sections of optic nerve indicated that the outer layers of the optic nerve were transduced with L-POD (Figure 5 panel D) at the 45 min time point. There was no staining observed with lissamine only (Figure 5 panel D) in similar experiments.\n\n\nExample 6. De novo synthesized POD-GFP localizes to the nucleus Transfection of human embryonic retinoblast (HER) cells [Fallaux FJ et al. 1996\n\n\nHum.Gene Ther. 7: 215-222] with pGFPHis, a plasmid expressing a His-tagged GFP, resulted in relatively diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of recombinant GFP (Figure 7 panel A). In contrast, transfection of HER cells with pPODGFPHis, a plasmid expressing a His- tagged POD-GFP fusion protein, resulted in relatively weak cytoplasmic and intense nuclear \n\n localization (Figure 7 panel B). Furthermore, POD-GFP appeared to concentrate in sub nuclear compartments (Figure 7 panel B, arrowheads).\n\n\nThis pattern of localization associated with POD-GFP observed herein contrasts with that of exogenously added lissamine-conjugated POD peptide (L-POD), shown in examples herein to localize primarily to the cytoplasm in a punctate pattern- reminiscent of endocytosis [Johnson LN et al. 2007 MoI Ther 16: 107-114].\n\n\nThese data show that endogenously expressed POD acts as a nuclear localization signal for POD fusion proteins.\n\n\nExample 7. Purification of POD-GFP from adenovirus-infected HER cells\n\n\nTo examine protein transduction by exogenously supplied POD-GFP, expression cassettes coding for His-tagged POD-GFP or GFP, regulated by a CMV promoter, were cloned into an E 1/E3 -deleted human adenovirus serotype 5 vector- AdPODGFPHis and AdGFPHis respectively (Figure 8 panel A). POD-GFP and GFP were purified from adenovirus infected HER cells and electrophoresed on a Tris-HCl acrylamide gel. Following silver staining, major bands were identified at approximately 32 and 28 Kd, corresponding to roughly the predicted molecular weight of POD-GFP and GFP respectively (Figure 8 panel B). Minor bands of slightly greater molecular weight were also detected for each of the proteins by silver staining. Western blot analyses of the purified protein fractions using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to GFP showed that the major bands corresponded to GFP and POD-GFP respectively (Figure 8 panel B).\n\n\nThese data show that recombinant adenovirus vectors generated relatively pure preparations of POD-fusion proteins when expressed in human cells.\n\n\nExample 8. Transduction Properties of POD-GFP in vitro\n\n\nTo determine the transduction capabilities of POD-GFP in vitro, each of approximately 0.2X10\n6\n human lung carcinoma epithelial cells (A549) or HER cells were incubated with lOμg of each of purified recombinant POD-GFP or control GFP protein for 2 hours and the number of GFP-positive cells were counted by FACS. A total of 35.3±0.9% and 1.4±0.4% of A549 cells were GFP-positive when incubated with POD-GFP or GFP respectively. Similarly, a total of 34.2±3.4% and 1.8±0.4% of HER cells were GFP-positive when incubated with POD-GFP or GFP respectively (Figure 9 panel A).\n\n\nExtent of toxicity to cells during protein transduction was measured by uptake of propidium iodide (PI). A total of 2.8±3.8% or 3.2±2.7% of HER cells were Pi-positive after \n\n cells were incubated with POD-GFP or GFP respectively, similar to that of untransfected cells (3.6+3.0%).\n\n\nIn contrast to endogenous gene expression, POD-GFP in the present example appeared in the cytoplasm of HER cells in a punctate pattern (Figure 9 panel B), similar to observations in examples above with L-POD peptide and similar to that of an endocytic mechanism of uptake. POD-GFP failed to coldcalize with ER tracker or DAPI, and was observed here to colocalize in part with Lysotracker (Figure 9 panel B), a marker of late endosomes- consistent with a model by which POD-GFP enters cells by more than one mechanism.\n\n\nThese data show that POD-GFP transduced cells in culture, and did not significantly damage the plasma membrane during entry, and in contrast to protein delivered by endogenous expression from a nucleic acid vector, POD-GFP colocalized in part with late endosomes.\n\n\nExample 9. Transduction Properties of POD-GFP in vivo\n\n\nTo determine the transduction properties of POD-GFP in vitro a 8.5μg of each of purified POD-GFP or control GFP protein was injected into the subretinal space, i.e., between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptors, of 6 week-old male C57BL6/J mice.\n\n\nEyes were harvested after 6 hours and frozen sections were examined by fluorescence microscopy.\n\n\nData showed that GFP-fluorescence associated with injection of control GFP protein was detected in the subretinal space, and the amount was barely discernible above background auto-fluorescence. Furthermore, there was no evidence of GFP in any other part of the retina in an amount exceeding that of auto-fluorescence (Figure 10 panel A).\n\n\nIn contrast, POD-GFP localized to the subretinal space, and was also detected in the\n\n\nRPE and was abundantly present in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), i.e. the location of the photoreceptor cell bodies (Figure 10 panel B). Depending upon extent of retinal detachment created during the injection procedure, transduction of the ONL was found in up to 40% of the retinal surface. Occasional GFP-positive cells were also noted in the nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer (GCL) following subretinal injection. Closer examination of the photoreceptor cell bodies in the ONL showed localized POD-GFP in the perinuclear space or plasma membrane, appearing in both a punctate and membrane-associated pattern (Figure 10 panel B, arrowheads).\n\n\nA total of 6.6 μg purified POD-GFP or control GFP protein was injected into the intravitreal space, i.e. between the lens and neural retina of 6 week-old male C57BL6/J mice, and eyes were harvested after 6 hours and frozen sections examined by fluorescence \n\n microscopy. The data show that following intravitreal injection, GFP-fluorescence associated with injection of control GFP protein was not detected in retinal cells above background auto- fluorescence (Figure 11 panel A). In contrast, POD-GFP was readily detected in ganglion cells (Figure 11 panel B) and in a subpopulation of cells in the inner nuclear layer (INL; Figure 1 1 panel B, arrowheads). Unlike with subretinal injection, no POD-GFP signal was detectable in the outer nuclear layer or RPE beyond that of background auto-fluorescence and the overall number of GFP-positive cells was less than that achieved by subretinal injection. Closer examination of the inner retina revealed that a large number of dendtrites also contained POD- GFP (Figure 11 panel B, arrow). Further data showed that the lens capsule following intravitreal injection, had a very strong affinity for POD-GFP but not for GFP (Figure 12 panel A). The affinity of POD-GFP for the lens may have reduced the amount of protein available for retinal transduction. This may account for poorer transduction of the neural retina via the intravitreal route relative to the subretinal route. In summary, data herein show that POD-GFP delivered to the intravitreal space transduces the ganglion cells and a limited number of cells in the INL, as well as the lens capsule. In contrast, delivery of POD-GFP into the subretinal space transduces the RPE and photoreceptor cells.\n\n\nExample 10. Topical application of POD-GFP to cornea in vivo A total of 40μg purified POD-GFP or control GFP protein was topically applied to the cornea of an anesthetized 6 week-old male C57BL6/J mouse, and eyes were harvested 45 minutes later for sectioning. Excitation of whole mouse eyes with 474 nm light revealed that the control GFP was washed away and therefore absent from the outer surface of the eye. In contrast, POD-GFP was detected on most of the ocular surface (Figure 12 panel B). To further examine localization of POD-GFP, anterior ocular tissues were dissected and the corneas were flat mounted or cross-sectioned and re examined by fluorescence microscopy. Data showed that control GFP-fluorescence was not detectable in flat mounts that had been prepared from mice with topical application of GFP. In contrast, GFP-fluorescence was readily detected on both flat mounts and cross sections of corneas from mice that received topical application of POD-GFP (Figure 12 panel B). Transverse sections revealed that the majority of the GFP-fluorescence associated with POD-GFP emanated from the corneal epithelium and minimally from the stroma (Figure 12 panel B). No GFP-signal was detected in corneal cross- sections prepared from mice that received topical application of control GFP.\n\n\n4fi \n\n These data show that topical application of POD-GFP to ocular tissues permits binding to the corneal epithelium.\n\n\nExample 11. Topical application of POD-GFP to skin in vivo The data and Examples herein describing the properties of POD focused primarily on retinal or ocular tissues. The success of the corneal topical application, as well as the potential of this mode of delivery for therapeutic proteins, prompted investigation of this type of application to other tissues.\n\n\nTo extend these observations to other organ systems, the potential of transdermal delivery of POD-fusion protein was examined. POD-GFP was topically applied (40μg) or control GFP to shaved skin of adult C57BL6/J mice. Animals were sacrificed 24 hours later and frozen sections of the treated region were examined by fluorescence microscopy.\n\n\nThe data show that hair follicles and hair within tissues were auto fluorescent after contact with POD-GFP. Only minimal GFP-fluorescence in contrast was observed with topical application of control GFP (Figure 13 panel A). The epidermis of skin prepared from mice that received POD-GFP was significantly GFP-positive (Figure 13 panel B). Uptake appeared punctate and diffuse and was almost exclusively associated with the epidermis and not the deeper layers of the skin (Figure 13 panel B). Binding observed around the hair follicle could not be definitively separated from auto fluorescence. These data show that control GFP did not significantly bind to mouse skin, and POD-\n\n\nGFP not only bound for at least 24 hours, but also was taken up by the epidermis.\n\n\nExample 12. cPOD, a cell-penetrating peptide, can deliver DNA in vitro but not in vivo to quiescent cells It is herein shown that c-POD (cysteine-POD) can compact a nucleic acid, neutralize its charge and deliver it to mitotic HER cells in vitro. To extend this observation to non-mitotic cells (as is the status of the majority of cells in vivo) A549 cells were serum-starved for 24 hours prior to the addition of a c-POD/pCAGGFP complex, containing a plasmid expressing GFP (pCAGGFP). Data shows that when A549 cells were undergoing mitosis, 6.05% were GFP-positive, however, < 1% of A549 cells were GFP-positive when active mitosis was inhibited (p<0.0005) (Figure 14 panel A). In addition, the mean cellular GFP-intensity was reduced from 1683 to 16.53 (pO.0001) in the presence and absence of serum/mitosis respectively. \n\n To quantify functional recombinant protein levels in transduced cells, A549 cells were transfected with a c-POD/pCAGLuc complex, containing a plasmid expressing luciferase (pCAGLuc). Results correlated with those using GFP in that cPOD increased transgene expression in dividing cells over control plasmid alone by almost six orders of magnitude(p<0.005) and over cPOD in non-dividing cells by four orders of magnitude\n\n\n(p<0.005). See Figure 14 panel B. However, when cPOD was used with non-dividing cells, transgene expression was higher than DNA only (p<0.05).\n\n\nThe data show that cPOD transduces non-dividing cells, but at levels of expression below detectablility using GFP. Hence, we conclude that actively mitotic cells are more amenable to transduction by c-POD/DNA complexes than non-mitotic cells, although data do not rule out the possibility that serum itself enhances transduction. To extend these observations to primary cells, C57 eyes were enucleated, the anterior chamber removed, and the RPE/sclera and retina were separated. When these explants were incubated ex vivo with cPOD compacted pCAGLuc for 48 hours, significant transfection was unexpectedly noted in the RPE/sclera for both an N:P ratio of 4.3 (RLU=I .0xl0\n5\n±7.7xl0\n4\n, pO.OOOl) and 8.6\n\n\n(RLU=1.4xl0\n4\n±9.1xl0\n3\n, pO.OOOl) (Figure 14 panel C) but not in the retina (data not shown). However, when these same experiments were conducted in vivo, no significant luciferase activity (p>0.05) was detected above background in either compaction (Figure 14 panel C). Hence, we conclude that whereas c-POD can compact and deliver DNA to mitotic cells in culture and primary cells in explants ex vivo, it fails to do so in vivo.\n\n\nExample 13. Functionalizing c-POD by pegylation inhibits particle aggregation while preserving DNA binding\n\n\nOne key difference between actively dividing and quiescent cells is that during mitosis, the nuclear membrane disintegrates and allows easy access of large molecules such as DNA into the nucleus. The intact nuclear membrane in post mitotic cells in vivo is considered a significant barrier to non- viral gene transfer. Examples herein test whether formation of large c-POD/DNA aggregates play a role in inhibiting gene transfer. To examine this hypothesis, rhodamine-labeled plasmid DNA was compacted using c-POD, and this complex was incubated with HER cells for 2 hours in culture. IT was observed that indeed, even at the level of light-microscopy large c-POD/DNA aggregates were readily visible (Figure 15 panel A) and ranged in size from 10-100μm. In order to attempt to reduce this level of aggregation, the free sulfhydryl bond on the cysteine of c-POD was functionalized with a 1OkD PEG-maleimide group. Although the predicted molecular weight after synthesis by mass spectroscopy of the c- \n\n POD monomer is 3.5 kD, a unique band was observed corresponding to approximately 17kD on a coomasie stained gel (Figure 15 panel B), indicating that c-POD forms pentamers in solution. Functionalization of this 17kD product with 1OK PEG generated a gel shift to the expected 27kD. A minor product was also detected at 37kD, indicating that some c-POD pentamers were functionalized by two 1OkD PEG molecules. Similar to c-POD [Johnson LN et al. 2008 MoI Ther 16: 107-114], pegylated POD (PEG-POD) also compacted DNA and retarded DNA migration into an agarose gel, that could be alleviated by pre-digestion of the c- POD peptide with trypsin (Figure 15 panel C). Unlike c-POD, PEG-POD did not form large aggregates when complexed with DNA and incubated with HER cells for 2 hours (Figure 15 panel D). We conclude that pegylation of c-POD prior to its electrostatic mixing with plasmid DNA significantly reduces the formation of aggregated products.\n\n\nExample 14. PEG-POD compacts DNA to form small, discrete nanoparticles\n\n\nCloser examination of pPOD~Luc complexes by transmission electron microscopy revealed that they consisted of relatively homogeneous 100-200 nm spherical nanoparticles (Figure 16). Independent measurement of particle size by diffuse light scattering (DLS) confirmed a size range of 136nm ± 27.2nm. In contrast, the controls, i.e. buffer or uncompacted DNA alone, were determined to be 1.6nm + Onm and 1221nm ± 753.4nm respectively by DLS. The large standard deviation for DNA (which has a large gyration radius) is expected given that DLS is primarily accurate for spherical particles between 2nm- 2000nm.\n\n\nExample 15. PEG-POD~RhoDNA and cPOD-RhoDNA particles have different localization in tissues in vivo In order to determine whether PEG-POD/DNA complexes penetrated tissues more efficiently than c-POD/DNA complexes, nanoparticles of rhodamine-labeled DNA (100ng) compacted with pegPOD (PEG-POD~RhoDNA) or c-POD (c-POD~RhoDNA) were injected into the subretinal space of 8 week old C57 male mice and harvested after 2 hours. In contrast to cPOD-RhoDNA particles that remained in the subretinal space, PEG-POD~RhoDNA particles appeared as punctate staining within the retinal pigment epithelium (Figure 17, second and fourth compared to first and third).\n\n\nExample 16. PEG-POD~Luc nanoparticles can transfect ocular tissue in vivo\n\n\n4Q \n\n PEG-POD-Luc nanoparticles were injected into the subretinal space of adult (6-7 weeks) BALB/C mice and were harvested after 48 hours to assay for luciferase activity. To normalize the RLU, the concentration of protein harvested and plotted the RLU per mg protein was quantified (Figure 18 panels A and B). Transfection using PEG-POD nanoparticles containing 1.2μg DNA (1.5 IXIO\n7\nIS-SSXIO\n6\n RLU/mg) exhibited expression levels significantly higher than 1.2μg DNA alone (5.54xl0\n4\n±1.47xl0\n4\n RLU/mg, pO.OOOl) or uninjected controls (1.09xl0\n4\n±1.04xl0\n3\n RLU/mg, pO.OOOl). DNA alone expression was significant above uninjected controls as well (p<0.05). When only 0.6μg of PEG-POD nanoparticles were injected in the same volume, there was still a significant increase in expression (1.17xl0\n6\n±5.48xl0\n5\n RLU/mg) over uninjected controls (pO.OOl) and 1.2μg naked DNA\n\n\n(p<0.05). Figure 18 panel C. However there was a significant reduction in mean luminescence of 9.8 fold compared to injections of 1.2μg of PEG-POD nanoparticles (p<0.05). From these data it was concluded that PEG-POD nanoparticles can efficiently deliver trangenes in vivo compared to DNA alone and that this property is dose dependant using the concentrations tested.\n\n\nRecombinant luciferase (Promega) was used to create a standard curve for the RLU values (R\n2\n=0.9999). The expression of naked pCAGLuc plasmid produced 1.915±0.5449 pg/mg, 0.6μg PEG-POD~Luc produced 43.23±20.26 pg/mg and 1.2μg PEG-POD~Luc . produced 425.2±141.7pg/mg luciferase protein.\n\n\nExample 17. PEG-POD increases tranfection compared to other PEGylated cell penetrating peptides\n\n\nIn addition to PEG-POD, the efficacy of other established cell penetrating peptides including TAT and CK30, a 30-mer polylysine were tested. CK30 is described in U.S. patent application serial number 10/656,192 filed September 8, 2003, Cooper et al.\n\n\nUsing the same protocol, these peptides were each PEGylated to produce PEG-TAT and PEG-CK30. PEG-TAT has been shown to compact DNA in cell culture [Ignatovich IA et al. 2003 J Biol Chem 278: 42625-42636; Rudolph C et al. 2003 J Biol Chem 278: 11411- 11418], but on it's own has not been used to deliver plasmid DNA in vivo. Various PEG- TAT:DNA ratios were used and compaction was assessed by gel electrophoresis. PEG-TAT was observed to fully compact plasmid DNA at 1.8nMole peptide: 2μg DNA, the same ratio used for PEG-POD. The PEG-TAT nanoparticles were made using the same protocol as PEG- POD nanoparticles. PEG-CK30 nanoparticles have been made previously and documented to show efficacy in vivo [Ziady AG et al. 2003 MoI Ther 8: 936-947; Farjo R et al. 2006 PLoS \n\n ONE 1 : e38; Liu G et al. 2003 J Biol Chem 278: 32578-32586] and so the ratio and protocol outlined in those studies were followed [Ziady AG et al. 2003 MoI Ther 8: 936-947], yielding fully compacted DNA by gel electrophoresis.\n\n\nBALB/C mice were injected subretinally with 1.2μg of either PEG-TAT~Luc or PEG- CK30~Luc and the eyes were harvested 48 hours later (Figure 18 panel A). PEG-T AT~Luc showed high levels of expression (2.849xlO6±l.298x106) and which was significantly increased compared to 1.2μg DNA alone (p<0.05) and uninjected controls (p<0.005). Of the PEG-CK30~Luc injections, one fell below the uninjected control mean RLU/mg + 3 standard deviations (Figure 18 panel A, dotted line). This was the only injection, of either naked DNA or nanoparticle DNA, that did not express increased luciferase, and so this injection was not counted in the final analysis of the data (Figure 18 panel B). PEG-CK30~Luc showed the lowest expression of the three cell penetrating peptides (8.379x105±4.310x105) but was still significantly increased above 1.2μg DNA alone (p<0.05) and uninjected controls (p<0.005). PEG-POD nanoparticles showed a significant 16.4 fold increase in the mean compared to PEG-CK30 (p<0.005). PEG-TAT nanopaticles were not significantly different from those formed by either PEG-POD or PEG-CK30 (p>0.05). These results show that all three cell penetrating peptides significantly increase peptide transfection in vivo compared to DNA alone. PEG-POD increased expression of plasmid DNA 215±63 fold, PEG-TAT 56.52±21.33, and PEG-CK30 24.73+15.30 compared to the same amount of DNA injected alone (Figure 18 panel C). However, PEG-POD appears to cause the most efficient transduction by subretinal injection.\n\n\nExample 18. Cell penetrating peptide nanoparticles transfect the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) To localize expression, nanoparticles were made using each of the PEGylated cell penetrating peptides containing plasmids expressing β-galactosidase (pCAGLacZ) and 1.2μg was injected subretinally into BALB/C mice. Eyes were harvested and stained for β- galactosidase activity after 48 hours (Figure 19). The amount of β-galactosidase activity correlated with the previously observed luciferase values (Figure 18) and localized in all injections to the RPE cell layer. While all three cell penetrating peptides were able to transduce the RPE, the most robust staining was seen by PEG-POD~LacZ and the least using PEG- CK30~LacZ. Control eyes were either uninjected or injected with the same amount of \n\n uncompacted DNA, luciferase nanoparticles, pegPOD alone, or buffer. No β-galactosidase stain was detected in any of the control eyes (data not shown).\n\n\nExample 19. PEG-POD protects plasmid DNA from DNase I digestion Serum nuclease activity is shown to significantlydecrease the half-life of plasmid DNA.\n\n\nDNA injected intravenously into mice is degraded within 10 minutes [Kawabata K et al. 1995 Pharm Res 12: 825], making protection from degradation an important property for genes to be successfully delivered in vivo by intravenous injection. Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) is an endonuclease found in human serum and many tissues in the body [Love J et al. 1979 J Bio Chem 254: 12588]. Previously, it has been shown that when a neutralizing antibody specific for DNase I is added to human serum, nuclease activity is completely inhibited, indicating that serum nuclease activity is derived from DNase I [Takeshita H et al. 2004 Clinical Chemistry 50: 446-448]. Serum and pancreatic DNase I exhibit essentially the same characteristics [Love J et al. 1979 J Bio Chem 254: 12588] and since the enzyme is easily purified from the pancreas, pancreatic DNAse I was therefore used to test the potential serum stability of the pegylated POD/DNA nanoparticles (Figure 20 panel A). In the absence of pronase, only pCAGLuc, the naked plasmid, was able to migrate into the gel while the pPOD~Luc nanoparticles remained compacted within the well of the gel. Subsequent to a 10 minute incubation with pronase, both pCAGLuc and pPOD~Luc DNA migrated into the gel. To test DNAse I resistance, the DNA or nanoparticles were incubated for 15 minutes with DNase I followed by a 10-minute incubation with pronase, which allowed visualization of the compacted DNA by degrading pPOD. After the addition of 0.25U DNase I, pCAGLuc had started to show signs of degradation, while pPOD~Luc was still intact. At a higher concentration of 2.5U DNase I, the pCAGLuc was completely degraded and was no longer detectable on the gel, whereas pPOD~Luc had only minor degradation. It was concluded that p-POD/DNA complexes were protected from DNase I degradation.\n\n\nExample 20. pPOD~Luc has higher tranfection efficiency than pCAGLuc in the lung, whereas pCAGLuc is higher in the liver after intravenous delivery Since pPOD protects DNA from DNase I digestion, whether this protection conferred an increased transfection during intravenous delivery in vivo was examined. BALB/C mice were injected with 150μL of 5% dextrose buffer containing either 40μg pCAGLuc or 40μg pPOD~Luc (Figure 17 panel B). When 40μg pCAGLuc was delivered intravenously, the levels of luciferase in the lung were determined to be 623.7±1.39.1 RLU/mg. In contrast, when 40μg \n\n pPOD~Luc was delivered intravenously, the luciferase levels were significantly greater at 4.445x10\n4\n±8082 RLU/mg (pO.OOOl). See Figure 20 panel B. Delivery of lOμg pPOD~Luc also resulted in higher levels of luciferase activity- 1670±430.5 RLU/mg (p<0.05). In summary, increasing the quantity of pPOD~Luc injected from lOμg to 40μg resulted in a significant increase in luciferase expression (p<0.0001) whereas naked plasmid alone did not significantly express luciferase in the lung above uniηjected mice (p>0.05).\n\n\nExample 21. pPOD~Luc does not cause toxicity by functional analysis\n\n\nTo examine the toxicity of the pCAG~Luc nanoparticles in vivo, we injected either 0.7μg pPOD~Luc in lμl (n=4) or lμl 5% dextrose (n=4), the same buffer as the nanoparticles, into the subretinal space of adult (6-8 week) C57 males. After 48-hours, electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded at two different light intensities. Both the pPOD~Luc and mock injected eyes had normal ERGs with defined A and B-waves (representative examples at -0 Log Light Intensity are shown in Figure 21 panel A). The waves were analyzed for A and B-wave amplitude and plotted by Log Light Intensity (Figure 21 panel B). There was no significant difference between injections under any of the test conditions (p>0.05).\n\n\nAdditional embodiments and examples of the invention are found in the claims below, which are illustrative and are not to be construed as further limiting.

This invention also relates to methods of treating a patient suffering from diseases associated with the formation of soluble, globular, non- fibrillar, neurotoxic amyloid βi_\n42\n oligomers by administering acylhydrazide compounds to the patients.\n\n\nState of the Art\n\n\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal progressive dementia that has no cure at present. Although the molecular basis of the disease is not established, considerable evidence now implicates neurotoxins derived from amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides and in particular the 42-amino acid amyloid beta peptide (Aβi_\n42\n). Aβ is an amphipathic peptide, the abundance of which is increased by gene mutations and risk factors linked to AD. Fibrils formed from Aβ constitute the cores of amyloid senile plaques, which are hallmarks of AD brain. Analogous fibrils generated in vitro are lethal to cultured brain neurons. These findings provided the central rationale for the original amyloid cascade hypothesis, a theory in which memory loss was proposed to be the consequence of neuron death caused by fibrillar Aβ (Hardy and Higgins (1992) Science 256:184-185). \n\n Despite its strong experimental support and intuitive appeal, the original amyloid cascade hypothesis has proven inconsistent with key observations, including the poor correlation between dementia and amyloid senile plaque burden (Katzman (1988) Ann. Neural. 23(2): 138-144). Using a transgenic mouse model of AD, two surprising findings were obtained when the mice were treated with monoclonal antibodies against Aβ: (1) vaccinated mice showed reversal of memory loss, with recovery evident in 24 hours; and (2) cognitive benefits of vaccination accrued despite no change in senile plaque levels (Dodart et al. (2002) Nat. Neurosci 5:452-457; Kotilinek et al. (2002) J. Neurosci. 22:6331-6335). Such findings are not consistent with a mechanism for memory loss dependent on neuron death caused by amyloid fibrils.\n\n\nSalient flaws in the original amyloid cascade hypothesis have been eliminated by an updated amyloid cascade hypothesis that incorporates a role for additional neurologically active molecules formed by Aβ self-assembly. These molecules are amyloid β-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), which assemble from Aβi_\n42\n at low concentrations (Lambert et al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:6448-6453). Essentially the missing links in the original amyloid cascade hypothesis, ADDLs rapidly inhibit long term potentiation (Lambert et al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:6448-6453; Walsh et al. (2002) Nature 416: 535-539; Wang et al. (2002) Brain Res. 924:133-140), a classic experimental paradigm for memory and synaptic plasticity. In the updated Aβ cascade hypothesis memory loss stems from synapse failure, prior to neuron death, with failure being caused by ADDLs, not fibrils (Hardy and Selkoe (2002) Science 297:353-356). ADDLs occur in brain tissue and are strikingly elevated in AD brain tissue compared to age matched controls (Kayed et al. (2002) Science 300:486-489; Gong et al. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:10417-10422) and in AD transgenic mice models (Kotilinek et al. (2002) J. Neurosci. 22:6331-6335; Chang et al. (2003) J. MoI. Neurosci. 20:305-313).\n\n\nA simplistic mechanistic approach to this theory can be illustrated as follows:\n\n\namyloid senile \nΛ\n . . . \nπ\n - . _ _ \nτ\n ^i ==; Monomeπc AB\n1-42\n \n~\n~ ADDLs where formation of ADDLs is a separate pathway from formation of amyloid senile plaque both of which are in equilibrium with monomeric Aβi_4\n2\n. \n\n Further experiments have shown important neurological properties of ADDLs. ADDLs were shown to have selective toxicity to hippocampal CAl neurons compared with CA3 neurons, and the complete absence of toxicity towards cerebellar neurons (Kim et al. (2003) FASEB J. 17:118-120). Ventricular injection OfAp\n1-42\n oligomers into wild-type rats resulted in rapid, compromised behavioral models with complete recovery occurring within 24 hours (Cleary et al. (2005) Nat. Neurosci. 8:79-84) and these deficits are attributed to higher order oligomers, specifically 12-mer oligomers (Lesne et al. (2006) Nature 440:352-357). ADDL binding to neurons occurs with high specificity and is localized to post-synaptic receptors on a subset of hippocampal neurons (Lacor et al. (2004) J. Neurosci. 24: 10191-10200). This triggers the rapid and persistent up- regulation of the immediate early gene product arc, translation of which is activity dependent at polyribosomes localized to subsets of dendritic spines (Steward et al. (1998) Neuron 21 :741-751; Guzowski et al. (2000) J. Neurosci. 20:3993-4001). More recently, ADDLs have been implicated as upstream activators of tau phosphorylation and have been shown to interfere with animal behavior at femtomolar levels (Matsubara et al. (2004) Neurobiol. Aging 25:833-841).\n\n\nThe reversibility of memory loss in mouse models, coupled with the neurological properties of ADDLs and their presence in an AD brain, provides strong support for the hypothesis that AD is a disease of ADDL-induced synaptic failure (Lambert et al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:6448-6453; Klein et al. (2001) Trends Neurosci. 24:219-220; Selkoe (2002) Science 298:789-791).\n\n\nThe use of antibodies specific to ADDLs is a powerful way to modulate the equilibrium between monomeric Aβi_\n42\n and ADDLs thereby providing treatment for disease conditions mediated by ADDLs. However, antibody delivery is typically limited to injectable solutions which pose patient compliance issues as well as the presence of an attending clinician. Small molecules that modulate this equilibrium, deliverable by non- injectable means such as oral delivery, transdermal delivery, pulmonary delivery, nasal delivery, etc. would be particularly beneficial.\n\n\nA number of small molecules developed originally as amyloid fibril blockers are purported to possess Aβ oligomer assembly blocking properties. Some of these \n\n compounds include Alzhmed™ (Gervais (2004) Neurobiol. Aging 25:S11-12), Clioquinol (Ritchie et al. (2003) Arch. Neural. 60:1685-1691), substituted β-cyclodextrins (Yu et al. (2002) J. MoI. Neurosci. 19:51-55), trehalose (Lui (2005) Neurobiol. Disease 20:74-81), simple amino, carbonyl, and nitro substituted phenols (De Felice et al. (2001) FASEB J. March 20; De Felice et al. (2004) FASEB J. 18: 1366-1372), Curcumin (Yang et al. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280(7):5892-5901), cyclohexanehexol analogs (McLaurin et al. (2006) Nature Med. 12:801-808), spirosterols (Lecanu et al.(2004) Steroids 69:1-16) and tricyclic pyrones (Maeqawa et al. (2006) J. Neurochem. 98:57-67). Two of these compounds, Alzhemed™ and Clioquinol, have progressed into clinical trials.\n\n\nAlzhemed™ (3-amino-l-propanesulfonic acid), a so-called \"GAG mimetic,\" is proposed to reduce soluble and insoluble amyloid levels by binding to Aβ monomer, although no experimental details have appeared to confirm the proposed mode of action. Alzhemed™ has recently completed a 20 month open-label extension of a Phase II trial, and there are reports of slowed cognitive decline in some patients with mild AD, however, no efficacy was observed during the blinded phase of the study (Gervais (2004) Neurobiol. Aging 25:S11-12).\n\n\nThe second compound in a phase II clinical trial, Clioquinol, was shown to stabilize the patients' cognitive ability compared to untreated patients and showed lower Ap\n1-42\n levels in their plasma (Ritchie et al. (2003) Arch. Neural. 60:1685-1691). However, a toxic impurity (a di-iodo form of Clioquinol) made during production has resulted in the study being halted and Clioquinol being replaced with an analog termed PBT2 (Blennow et al. (2006) Lancet 368:387-403).\n\n\nLastly, an unidentified compound or compounds from an extract of ginko biloba leaves was reported to lower the levels of Aβi_4\n2\n trimers and tetramers and increase the levels of high molecular weight polymers in a dose dependent manner (Yao et al. (2001) Brain Res. 889 : 181 - 190). Dose dependent protection against Aβ oligomer induced toxicity to PC- 12 cells was also reported.\n\n\nOf the compounds reported to block Aβ assembly or bind to Aβi_4\n2\n monomer, few appear to have high therapeutic potential. Given its very simple structure and hydrophilic properties, it is highly unlikely that Alzhemed™ has high and selective \n\n affinity for Ap\n1-42\n monomer. Any effect that Alzhemed™ has on Aβ aggregation or disaggregation is likely attributable to its interaction with ionic residues near the N-terminus of Aβi_\n42\n . The cyclodextrins do not have either lead-like or drug-like properties that would recommend them for development (Oprea et al. (2001) J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 41:1308- 1315; Vieth et al. (2004) J. Med. Chem. 47:224-232), and the phenols of De Felice contain aldehyde and nitro functionalities that are often considered reactive and excluded from pharmaceutical screening libraries (Walters and Namchuk (2003) Nat. Rev. 2:259-266). A number of molecules containing the phenol functionality have been reported as \"frequent hitters\" in screening libraries (Roche et al. (2002) J. Med. Chem. 45:137-142). Thus, further evaluation of the activity and selectivity of the phenols of De Felice is needed to confirm that these compounds are valid hits. Some compounds with a steroidal backbone have been reported to be promiscuous inhibitors due to an unexpected self aggregation process (McGovern et al. (2002) J. Med. Chem. 45:1712-1722), which may explain the ambiguous spirosterol results. Finally, the active ingredient in the ginko biloba extract is unknown. Thus, most of the purported Aβ assembly blockers would not be considered compounds for therapeutic development.\n\n\nNotwithstanding these putative results and as noted above, binding assays indicate that these compounds are, at best, moderate antagonists to ADDL formation. Accordingly, it would be particularly beneficial to provide for small molecules which provide enhanced inhibition, regulation, and/or modulation of ADDL formation.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThis invention is directed to the discovery that soluble, globular, non- fibrillar, neurotoxic Aβ\n1-42\n (ADDL) formation can be antagonized by certain compounds.

Methods of the Invention\n\n\nBefore the methods are described, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the particular methodologies, protocols, cell lines, assays, and reagents described, as these may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is intended to describe particular embodiments of the present invention, and is in no way intended to limit the scope of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims.\n\n\nIt must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms \"a,\" \"an,\" and \"the\" include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.\n\n\nUnless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meanings as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods, devices, and materials are now described. All publications cited herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the invention is not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention. \n\n The definitions used herein are limited to the application of small molecules as they relate to ADDL aggregation or oligomerization and diseases mediated by such.\n\n\nThis invention is directed to the discovery that the formation of soluble, oligomeric, globular, non-fϊbrillar, neurotoxic Ap\n1-42\n peptides (ADDLs) can be antagonized by compounds of formula I, II, or III. Without being limited by any theory, it is believed that the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the compounds described herein will interact with key assembly motifs within the Aβi_\n42\n monomers or within critical motifs on the Aβi_\n42\n oligomers. This interaction, in turn, will prevent the formation of neurotoxic ADDLs or the activity of such ligands. The disruption of the ADDLs or the activity of such ligands will protect long term potentiation of neuronal cells thereby obviating and/or reversing the neurotoxicity associated with ADDL. In addition, this interaction does not interfere with the formation of Aβ senile plaques.\n\n\nThe term \"ADDL\" is conventionally defined as amyloid beta-derived diffusable ligands which have the following characteristics: soluble, oligomeric, globular, non- fibrillar, neurotoxic Aβ\n1-42\n peptides (GenBank Ref. No. IZOQ A, accessed on November 21, 2007).\n\n\nThe compounds described herein are useful in a method for inhibiting, regulating and/or modulating assembly of ADDLs either in vitro or in vivo.\n\n\nThe term \"soluble\" means the ability for a given substance, the solute (an example in the instant invention is the Aβ\n1-42\n oligomer), to dissolve in a solvent. Within the context of the instant invention, soluble Aβ oligomers are capable of being fractionated by centrifugation.\n\n\nThe term \"oligomeric\" means a protein complex of a finite number of monomer subunits. In the context of the invention, oligomers are referred to as trimers, low-n-mers, dodecamers (12-mers), and large-n-multimers composed of Aβ\n1-42\n peptides. The term \"oligomeric\" does not include senile amyloid plaques.\n\n\nThe term \"globular\" means a large soluble protein complex, which is to be distinguished from fibrils and amyloid plaques. Preferably, the globular structure ranges in \n\n size from 4 nanometers (nm) to about 12 nm, preferably, from about 4.7 to about 11 nm, which can be observed upon atomic force microscope analysis (AFM) of supernatant fractions of Ap\n1-42\n soluble oligomer preparations as described in US Patent No. 6,218,506.\n\n\nThe term \"non-fibrillar\" means the Aβi_\n42\n peptides and oligomeric complexes that are not aligned in a morphologically distinct pattern known as amyloid protofibrils or amyloid fibrils.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, the compounds described herein are useful for antagonizing ADDL formation in vivo and the diseases associated with ADDL formation. As such, the terms \"disease,\" \"disorder,\" and \"condition\" are used inclusively and refer to any condition mediated, at least in part, by ADDLs. In the context of this invention the disease may be associated with insoluble amyloid fibrils, senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and/or the over-expression of amyloid β\n1-42\n protein. Examples include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, Down's Syndrome, mild cognitive impairment, stroke, focal ischemia associated dementia, and neuronal degeneration. Patients amenable to treatment include individuals at risk of disease but not exhibiting symptoms, as well as patients presently exhibiting symptoms. Therefore, the compounds described herein can be administered prophylactically to the general population without the need for any assessment of the risk of the patient.\n\n\nThe term \"amyloid fibrils\" means protein aggregates sharing specific structural traits. Histopathological techniques generally identify the structures by apple- green birefringence when stained with Congo red and seen under polarized light.\n\n\nThe term \"senile plaque\" or \"senile plaque formation\" refers to the extracellular deposit of amyloid in the gray matter of the brain. The deposits are associated with degenerative neural structures. It is understood that senile plaque is different from and distinguished over ADDLs.\n\n\nThe term \"tangles\" means the neurofibrillary tangles formed inside of degenerating neurons by bundling of paired helical filaments, which assemble from hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein know as tau. \n\n The term \"patient\" refers to animals, including mammals, humans, and non- human mammals. In certain embodiments, a patient is an animal, particularly an animal selected from a mammalian species including rat, rabbit, bovine, ovine, porcine, canine, feline, murine, equine, and primate, particularly human.\n\n\nThe methods are especially useful for patients who have a known genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease. Such individuals include those having relatives who have been diagnosed with the disease and those whose risk is determined by analysis of genetic or biochemical markers. Genetic markers of risk for Alzheimer's disease include mutations in the APP gene, particularly mutations at position 717 and positions 670 and 671 referred to as the Hardy and Swedish mutations respectively. Other markers of risk are mutations in the presenilin genes, PSl and PS2, and ApoE4, family history of Alzheimer's Disease, hypercholesterolemia or atherosclerosis. Individuals presently suffering from Alzheimer's disease can be recognized from characteristic dementia, as well as the presence of risk factors described above. In addition, a number of diagnostic test are available for identifying individuals who have Alzheimer's disease. These include measurement of CSF tau as described in Vandermeeren et al. (1993) J. Neurochem. 61:1828-1834; Arai et al. (1995) Ann. Neural. 38:649-652; and Jansen et al. (1995) Neurosci. Lett. 186:189-191 and Ap\n1-42\n levels as described in Andreasen et al. (1999) Arch. Neural. 56:673-680; Vanderstichele et al., \"Development of a specific diagnostic test for measurement of β- amyloidl-42 in CSF\", Progress in Alzheimer's and Parkinson 's diseases, Fisher et al. (eds), New York, Plenum, pgs. 773-778; and Hulstaert et al. (1999) Neurology 52:1555-1562. Individuals suffering from Alzheimer's disease can also be diagnosed by NINCDS-ADRDA (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/ Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association) criteria as described in Hogervorst et al. \"Diagnosing dementia: Interrater Reliability Assessment and Accuracy of the\n\n\nNINCDS/ADRDA Criteria versus CERAD Histopathological Criteria for Alzheimer's Disease\" University of Oxford, Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Aging (OPTIMA), Oxford, UK; and McKhann et al. (1984) Neurology 34(7):939-944.\n\n\nIn asymptomatic patients, treatment can begin at any age (e.g., 10, 20, 30 years of age). Usually, however, it is not necessary to begin treatment until a patient reaches about 40, 50, 60, or 70 years of age. Treatment typically entails multiple dosages \n\n over a period of time. Treatment can be monitored by assaying for the presence of ADDLs over time.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, the methods described herein are useful for treating patients. As used herein, the terms \"Treating\" or \"treatment\" of a disease includes: (1) preventing the disease, i.e., causing the clinical symptoms of the disease not to develop in a patient that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease; (2) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting or reducing the development of the disease or its clinical symptoms; or (3) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease or its clinical symptoms.\n\n\nThe term \"suffering\" as it related to the term \"treatment\" refers to a patient or individual who has been diagnosed with or is predisposed to a disease. A patient may also be referred to being \"at risk of suffering\" from a disease. This patient has not yet developed characteristic disease pathology, however are known to be predisposed to the disease due to family history, being genetically predisposed to developing the disease, or diagnosed with a disease or disorder that predisposes them to developing the disease to be treated.\n\n\nIn addition to Alzheimer's disease, several other disease are known to be associated with Ap\n1-42\n formation including, but are not limited to, Down's Syndrome, stroke and mild cognitive impairment. It is conceivable that similar to Alzheimer's disease, treatment of patients suffering from or at risk of suffering from these diseases is possible due to the parallel mechanisms of the diseases.\n\n\nSimilarly, over-expression of Aβ\n1-42\n is associated with focal ischemia associated dementia and neuronal degeneration. Over-expression of Aβi_\n42\n is believed to result in accumulation of ADDLs, thereby inducing neurotoxicity. Treating a patient suffering from or at risk of suffering from one of these diseases by administration of one or more of the compounds described herein will ameliorate the neurotoxicity of over-expressed\n\n\nThe term \"neurotoxicity\" refers to the toxic effect of ADDLs on neuronal cells either in vitro and/or in vivo. ADDLs bind to specific neuronal receptors triggering \n\n aberrant neuronal signaling, which compromises long term potentiation and causes memory deficits. Thus, ADDLs alter the function of the neuronal cell in such a manner that, while still viable, the neuron does not properly function. Such altered functionality is referred to herein as \"neuronal dysfunction,\" which is a subclass of neurotoxicity. Persistent ADDL signaling causes aberrant transcription and the progressive loss of synapses, and very long term persistent ADDL signaling and accumulated structural pathology leads to eventual neuron death and gross brain dystrophy.\n\n\nIn therapeutic applications, a pharmaceutical composition containing one or more compounds described herein is administered to a patient suspected of, or already suffering from such a disease associated with the accumulation of ADDLs, wherein said compounds are administered in an amount sufficient to treat, or at least partially treat, the symptoms of the disease (biochemical, histological and/or behavioral), including its complication and intermediate pathological phenotypes in development of the disease. In prophylactic applications, a pharmaceutical composition containing one or more compounds described herein is administered to a patient susceptible to, or otherwise at risk of, a disease associated with the accumulation of ADDLs, wherein said compounds are administered in an amount sufficient to eliminate or reduce the risk, lessen the severity, or delay the outset of the disease. This includes biochemical, histological and/or behavioral symptoms of the disease, its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of the disease.\n\n\nIn some methods, administration of the compound reduces or eliminates mild cognitive impairment in patients that have not yet developed characteristic Alzheimer's pathology. In particular embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount intends to indicate the amount of one or more compounds described herein administered or delivered to the patient which is most likely to result in the desired response to treatment.\n\n\nThe invention is directed to enhancing cognitive function in a patient who has diminished function. The term \"cognitive function\" refers to the intellectual process by which one becomes aware of, perceives, or comprehends ideas. Cognitive function embraces the quality of knowing, which includes all aspects of perception; recognition; conception; sensing; thinking; reasoning; remembering and imagining. \n\n The term \"diminished cognitive function\" refers to memory loss, mental slowing, intellectual decline and/or amnesia. Memory loss may be characterized as the difficulty or failure for immediate or delayed recall. Mental slowing is the difficulty in processing or completing previously learned tasks in a timely manner or in processing new information quickly. Intellectual decline is defined as a loss of information, or an inability to utilize information previously possessed or utilized by a person. Amnesia is an extreme loss of cognitive ability which results in partial or total inability to recall past experiences and impaired or total loss of the ability to speak or write. Diminished cognitive function may be caused by a number of disease conditions which are more thoroughly discussed below.\n\n\nMethods of assessing cognitive function include, but are not limited to, standardized instruments for example Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination; Modified Mini-Mental State Exam; Middlesex Elderly Assessment of Mental State; Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire; Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale; Clock Drawing Test; Clinical Dementia Rating; Neuropsychiatric Inventory or any similarly designed test. Using the above listed tests, a skilled clinician would be able to assess the level of diminished cognitive function of a patient or enhanced cognitive function following treatment. Additionally, informal observations and interactions of individuals to a patient can also be used to assess cognitive function and include, but are not limited to, family members, friends, formal care givers such as nurses, and individuals who have previous intimate knowledge of the patient.\n\n\nMechanical measure of the neurons and neuronal tissue may also be used to assess cognitive function including, but not limited to, Computed Tomography (CT); Computed Axial Tomography (CAT); Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI); Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI); Positron Emission Tomography (PET): Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT); Diffuse Optical Imaging (DOI); Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) or any similarly designed instrumentation.\n\n\nAn \"effective amount\" is an amount of one or more of the compounds described herein which treats the ADDL-mediated disease. In one embodiment, the \n\n compounds of this invention will decrease ADDL formation either in vitro or in vivo by at least 10%, 25%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 90% or 95% as compared to control.\n\n\nThe \"therapeutically effective amount\" will vary depending on the compound, the disease and its severity and the age, weight, etc., of the patient to be treated all of which is within the skill of the attending clinician to assess. It is contemplated that a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the compounds described herein will alter ADDL formation (including inhibiting or reversing formation of ADDLs) in the patient as compared to binding of ADDLs in the absence of treatment. As such, impairment of long term potentiation and subsequent memory formation is decreased. A therapeutically effective amount is distinguishable from an amount having a biological effect (a\n\n\n\"biologically effective amount\"). A compound of the present invention may have one or more biological effects in vitro or even in vivo, such as reduction in ADDL formation to some extent. A biological effect, however, may not result in any clinically measurable therapeutically effect as described above as determined by methods within the skill of the attending clinician.\n\n\nThe present invention is also directed ADDL inhibition in a neuronal cell and/or neuronal tissue. A \"neuronal cell\" or \"neuron\" is a cell that transmits and processes signals in the brain or other parts of the nervous system. Additionally, a neuronal cell, as used in the invention, can be isolated from animal brain tissue and grown in tissue culture. The isolated cells can be comprised of an established neuronal cell line selected from for example, but are not limited to, MC65; HCN-2; SH-SY5Y; SK-N-AS; SK-N-FI; SK-N-DZ; H19-7/IGF-IR; QNR/D; QNR/K2; C8-D30; C8-S; C8-D1A; OLGA-PH-J/92; Daoy; RSC96; SWlO; RT4-D6P2T; RN33B; PC-12; DBRTG-05MG; C8-B4; SK-N-SH; B35; R3[33-10ras3]; Neuro-2A; and HCN-IA or any genetic, chemical, and/or biochemical modified variants thereof. (Commercially available from American Type Culture\n\n\nCollection (ATCC)). The isolated cells can also be comprised of primary cells and/or astrocytes isolated from neuronal tissues selected from, for example, but are not limited to, the hippocampus; cerebellum; cortex; hypothalamus; mid-brain; spinal cord; striatum; frontal lobe; temporal lobe; parietal lobe; occipital lobe and any genetic, chemical, and/or biochemical modified variants thereof. The isolated, cultured animal cell can be comprised of a neural stem cell or any differentiated, genetic, chemical, and/or biochemical modified \n\n variants thereof. Additionally, a neuronal cell or neuron can be isolated and distinguished from other cell types by detecting expression of neuronal markers selected from, but not limited to, CD133, GFAP, MAP-2, MPB, Nestin, Neural tubulin, Neurofilament, Neurosphere, Noggin, 04, 01, Synaptophysin, and Tau (http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/scireport/appendixE.asp, accessed on November 26, 2007).\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"neuronal tissue\" refers to any portion of the central nervous system including, but not limited to, the brain or spinal cord. Neuronal tissue can be composed of, at least in part, neuronal cells.\n\n\nB. Compounds The compounds useful in the methods of the invention contain one or more and any combination of the following characteristics: (1) low or sub-micromolar potency when tested in the FRET assay described herein; (2) non-aggregating; (3) little or no neuronal toxicity when administered to a patient; (4) favorable solubility in an aqueous environment; (5) chemically tractable; (6) dose dependent characteristics; (7) reversibly bind to the Aβ protein; (8) capable of amyloid β monomer binding; (9) capable of binding soluble amyloid β oligomers.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the compounds useful for treating patients are suitable for oral delivery. In this embodiment, the compounds are compliant with Lipinski's rule-of-fϊve which provides a criteria to evaluate drug likeness. The rule states that, in general, an orally active drug has: no more than 5 hydrogen bond donors (OH and NH groups); no more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors (notably N and O); a molecular weight under 500 g/mol; and a partition coefficient log P less than 5.\n\n\n1.

Wermuth (Eds.), Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts Properties, Selection, and Use; 2002.\n\n\nUnless indicated otherwise, the nomenclature of substituents that are not explicitly defined herein are arrived at by naming the terminal portion of the functionality followed by the adjacent functionality toward the point of attachment. For example, the substituent \"arylalkyloxycabonyl\" refers to the group (aryl)-(alkyl)-O-C(O)-.\n\n\nIt is understood that in all substituted groups defined above, polymers arrived at by defining substituents with further substituents to themselves (e.g., substituted aryl having a substituted aryl group as a substituent which is itself substituted with a substituted aryl group, which is further substituted by a substituted aryl group etc.) are not intended for inclusion herein. In such cases, the maximum number of such substitutions is three. For example, serial substitutions of substituted aryl groups with two other substituted aryl groups are limited to -substituted aryl-(substituted aryl)-substituted aryl.\n\n\nSimilarly, it is understood that the above definitions are not intended to include impermissible substitution patterns (e.g., methyl substituted with 5 fluoro groups). Such impermissible substitution patterns are well known to the skilled artisan.\n\n\n3.

Applications of FRET for Compound Discovery Further compounds useful in the methods of the invention may be evaluated by the FRET assay described in Example 16. This assay was used on a variety of commercially available compound libraries to assess the specific inhibition formation of soluble amyloid P\n1-42\n oligomers of each compound. Lead compounds were identified and further compound libraries were obtained. In addition, structure activity relationships around lead compounds were conducted leading to still further enhancements in activity. \n\n D. Synthesis of Compounds of the Invention\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.\n\n\nAdditionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. Suitable protecting groups for various functional groups as well as suitable conditions for protecting and deprotecting particular functional groups are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Second Edition, Wiley, New York, 1991, and references cited therein.\n\n\nFurthermore, the compounds of this invention may contain one or more chiral centers. Accordingly, if desired, such compounds can be prepared or isolated as pure stereoisomers, i.e., as individual enantiomers or diastereomers, or as stereoisomer-enriched mixtures. All such stereoisomers (and enriched mixtures) are included within the scope of this invention, unless otherwise indicated. Pure stereoisomers (or enriched mixtures) may be prepared using, for example, optically active starting materials or stereoselective reagents well-known in the art. Alternatively, racemic mixtures of such compounds can be separated using, for example, chiral column chromatography, chiral resolving agents and the like.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention were synthesized according to Examples provided below.\n\n\nD. Testing and Administration\n\n\nEffective doses of the compositions of the present invention, for the treatment of the above described diseases, vary depending upon may different factors, including means of administration, physiological state of the patient, whether the patient is \n\n human or an animal, other medications administered, and whether treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. Usually, the patient is a human, but in certain embodiments, a patient is an animal, particularly an animal selected from a mammalian species including rat, rabbit, bovine, ovine, porcine, canine, feline, murine, equine, and primate.\n\n\nThe compounds can be administered on multiple occasions, wherein intervals between single dosages can be daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. Intervals can also be irregular as indicated by measuring blood levels of Aβi_\n42\n protein or ADDLs, or ADDL complexes in the patient. Alternatively, one or more of the compounds of the invention can be administered as a sustained-release formulation, in which case less frequent administration is required. Dosage and frequency may vary depending on the half- life of the compounds of the invention. In therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage at relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated, and sometimes until the patient shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of the disease. Thereafter, the patient can be administered a prophylactic regime.\n\n\nAdministration of a pharmaceutical composition of on the compounds described herein can be carried out via a variety of routes including, but are not limited to, oral, topical, pulmonary, rectal, subcutaneous, intradermal, intranasal, intracranial, intramuscular, intraocular, or intra-articular injection and the like. The most typical route of administration is oral, although other routes can be equally effective.\n\n\nOne or more compounds described herein can optionally be administered in combination with other biological or chemical agents that are at least partly effective in treatment of a Ap\n1-42\n associated disease. An example of such an agent is, but are not limited to, Aβi_\n42\n targeted antibodies as described in International Application Nos.: WO 2003/253673; WO 2006/014478, US Patent No. 2,489,195, US Publication No. 2007- 0048312, and US Application No. 11/571,532, which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe compounds described herein may be administered to a patient in an amount sufficient to inhibit, regulate and/or modulate the formation of neurotoxic ADDLs or the activity of such ligands in said patient. A skilled clinician would be able to readily ascertain appropriate amounts of the compounds described here to effectively inhibit, regulate and/or modulate the formation of neurotoxic ADDLs or the activity of such ligands \n\n in said patient. Contemplated amounts of the compounds described herein include for example, but are not limited to, from about 0.05 to 2000 mg/m /day of one compound or more than one compound.\n\n\nAs noted above, the compounds described herein may be administered for example, but are not limited to, orally, topically, pulmonaryly, rectally, subcutaneously, intradermally, intranasally, intracranially, intramuscularly, intraocularly, or intra-arterially and the like. The carrier or excipient or excipient mixture can be a solvent or a dispersive medium containing for example, but are not limited to, various polar or non-polar solvents, suitable mixtures thereof, or oils. As used herein \"carrier\" or \"excipient\" means a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and includes any and all solvents, dispersive agents or media, coating(s), antimicrobial agents, iso/hypo/hypertonic agents, absorption-modifying agents, and the like. The use of such substances and the agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Moreover, other or supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the final composition.\n\n\nDiseases which are treated by the methods described herein include\n\n\nAlzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, stroke, mild cognitive impairment, focal ischemia associated dementia and neuronal degeneration.\n\n\nE. Pharmaceutical Formulations and Routes of Administration\n\n\nWhen employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of this invention are usually administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These compounds can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, topical, pulmonary, rectal, subcutaneous, intradermal, intranasal, intracranial, intramuscular, intraocular, or intra-articular injection. These compounds are effective as both injectable and oral compositions. Such compositions are prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one active compound.\n\n\nThis invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the active ingredient, one or more of the compounds described herein associated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In making the compositions of this invention, the active ingredient is usually mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed \n\n within such a carrier which can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. The excipient employed is typically an excipient suitable for administration to patient. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.\n\n\nIn preparing a formulation, it may be necessary to mill the active compound to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it ordinarily is milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size is normally adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g. about 40 mesh.\n\n\nSome examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art.\n\n\nAdministration of therapeutic agents by intravenous formulation is well known in the pharmaceutical industry. An intravenous formulation should possess certain qualities aside from being just a composition in which the therapeutic agent is soluble. For example, the formulation should promote the overall stability of the active ingredient(s), also, the manufacture of the formulation should be cost effective. All of these factors ultimately determine the overall success and usefulness of an intravenous formulation. \n\n Other accessory additives that may be included in pharmaceutical formulations of compounds of the present invention as follow: solvents: ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol; stabilizers: ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), citric acid; antimicrobial preservatives: benzyl alcohol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben; buffering agents: citric acid/sodium citrate, potassium hydrogen tartrate, sodium hydrogen tartrate, acetic acid/sodium acetate, maleic acid/sodium maleate, sodium hydrogen phthalate, phosphoric acid/potassium dihydrogen phosphate, phosphoric acid/disodium hydrogen phosphate; and tonicity modifiers: sodium chloride, mannitol, dextrose.\n\n\nThe presence of a buffer may be necessary to maintain the aqueous pH in the range of from about 4 to about 8 and more preferably in a range of from about 4 to about 6. The buffer system is generally a mixture of a weak acid and a soluble salt thereof, e.g., sodium citrate/citric acid; or the monocation or dication salt of a dibasic acid, e.g. , potassium hydrogen tartrate; sodium hydrogen tartrate, phosphoric acid/potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and phosphoric acid/disodium hydrogen phosphate.\n\n\nThe amount of buffer system used is dependent on (1) the desired pH; and\n\n\n(2) the amount of drug. Generally, the amount of buffer used is in a 0.5:1 to 50:1 mole ratio of buffer: drug (where the moles of buffer are taken as the combined moles of the buffer ingredients, e.g., sodium citrate and citric acid) of formulation to maintain a pH in the range of 4 to 8 and generally, a 1 :1 to 10:1 mole ratio of buffer (combined) to drug present is used.\n\n\nOne useful buffer in the invention is sodium citrate/citric acid in the range of\n\n\n5 to 50 mg per mL of sodium citrate to 1 to 15 mg per mL of citric acid, sufficient to maintain an aqueous pH of 4-6 of the composition.\n\n\nThe buffer agent may also be present to prevent the precipitation of the drug through soluble metal complex formation with dissolved metal ions, e.g., Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, Ba, which may leach out of glass containers or rubber stoppers or be present in ordinary tap water. The agent may act as a competitive complexing agent with the drug and produce a soluble metal complex leading to the presence of undesirable particulates.\n\n\nIn addition, the presence of an agent, e.g., sodium chloride in an amount of about of 1-8 mg/mL, to adjust the tonicity to the same value of human blood may be \n\n required to avoid the swelling or shrinkage of erythrocytes upon administration of the intravenous formulation leading to undesirable side effects such as nausea or diarrhea and possibly to associated blood disorders. In general, the tonicity of the formulation matches that of human blood which is in the range of 282 to 288 mθsm/kg, and in general is 285 mOsm/kg , which is equivalent to the osmotic pressure corresponding to a 0.9% solution of sodium chloride.\n\n\nThe intravenous formulation can be administered by direct intravenous injection, i.v. bolus, or can be administered by infusion by addition to an appropriate infusion solution such as 0.9% sodium chloride injection or other compatible infusion solution.\n\n\nThe compositions can be formulated in an oral unit dosage form. The term \"unit dosage forms\" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for a patient, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.\n\n\nThe active compound is effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It, will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like. One of skill in the art, based on Example 17, would be able to readily assess the appropriate concentration of active compound to provide the necessary cognitive restoration.\n\n\nFor preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type \n\n described above containing from, for example, 0.05 to about 2000 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention.\n\n\nThe tablets or pills of the present invention may be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.\n\n\nThe liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.\n\n\nCompositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be attached to a face masks tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions may be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.\n\n\nThe following formulation examples illustrate the contemplated pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention. \n\n Formulation Example 1\n\n\nHard gelatin capsules containing the following ingredients are prepared:\n\n\nIngredient Quantity (mg/capsule)\n\n\nActive Ingredient 30.0\n\n\nStarch 305.0\n\n\nMagnesium stearate 5.0\n\n\nThe above ingredients are mixed and filled into hard gelatin capsules in 340 mg quantities.\n\n\nFormulation Example 2\n\n\nA tablet formula is prepared using the ingredients below:\n\n\nIngredient Quantity (mg/tablet)\n\n\nActive Ingredient 25.0\n\n\nCellulose, microcrystalline 200.0\n\n\nColloidal silicon dioxide 10.0\n\n\nStearic acid 5.0\n\n\nThe components are blended and compressed to form tablets, each weighing 240 mg.\n\n\nFormulation Example 3\n\n\nA dry powder inhaler formulation is prepared containing the following components:\n\n\nIngredient Weight %\n\n\nActive Ingredient 5\n\n\nLactose 95 The active ingredient is mixed with the lactose and the mixture is added to a dry powder inhaling appliance.\n\n\nFormulation Example 4\n\n\nTablets, each containing 30 mg of active ingredient, are prepared as follows: \n\n Ingredient Quantity (mg/tablet)\n\n\nActive Ingredient 30.0 mg\n\n\nStarch 45.0 mg\n\n\nMicrocrystalline cellulose 35.0 mg\n\n\nPolyvinylpyrrolidone 4.0 mg\n\n\n(as 10% solution in sterile water)\n\n\nSodium carboxymethyl starch 4.5 mg\n\n\nMagnesium stearate 0.5 mg\n\n\nTalc 1.0 me\n\n\nThe active ingredient, starch, and cellulose are passed through a No. 20 mesh U.S. sieve and mixed thoroughly.

Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent 5,023,252, issued June 11, 1991, herein incorporated by reference. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.\n\n\nFrequently, it will be desirable or necessary to introduce the pharmaceutical composition to the brain, either directly or indirectly. Direct techniques usually involve placement of a drug delivery catheter into the host's ventricular system to bypass the blood-brain barrier. One such implantable delivery system used for the transport of biological factors to specific anatomical regions of the body is described in U.S. Patent 5,011,472, which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nIndirect techniques, usually involve formulating the compositions to provide for drug latentiation by the conversion of hydrophilic drugs into lipid-soluble drugs. Latentiation is generally achieved through blocking of the hydroxyl, carbonyl, sulfate, and primary amine groups present on the drug to render the drug more lipid soluble and amenable to transportation across the blood-brain barrier. Alternatively, the delivery of \n\n hydrophilic drugs may be enhanced by intra-arterial infusion of hypertonic solutions, which can transiently open the blood-brain barrier.\n\n\nOther suitable formulations for use in the present invention can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mace Publishing Company, Philadelphia, PA, 17th ed. (1985).\n\n\nAs noted above, the compounds described herein are suitable for use in a variety of drug delivery systems described above. Additionally, in order to enhance the in vivo serum half- life of the administered compound, the compounds may be encapsulated, introduced into the lumen of liposomes, prepared as a colloid, or other conventional techniques may be employed which provide an extended serum half- life of the compounds. A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in, e.g., Szoka, et al, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728 and 4,837,028 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nIn prophylactic applications, compositions are administered to a patient at risk of developing AD (determined for example by genetic screening or familial trait) in an amount sufficient to inhibit the onset of symptoms of the disease. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as \"prophylactically effective dose.\" Amounts effective for this use will depend on the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like.\n\n\nAs noted above, the compounds administered to a patient are in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions may be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 11 , more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 and 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts. \n\n The following examples are offered to illustrate this invention and are not to be construed in any way as limiting the scope of this invention. Unless otherwise stated, all temperatures are in degrees Celsius.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe invention is further understood by reference to the following examples, which are intended to be purely exemplary of the invention. The present invention is not limited in scope by the exemplified embodiments, which are intended as illustrations of single aspects of the invention only.

FRET occurs if (1) the quantum of energy emitted by a donor fluorophore corresponds to an acceptor fluorophore 's \n\n excitation energy, (2) the orientations of donor and acceptor transition dipoles are nearly parallel and (3) the donor fluorescent emission spectrum overlaps the acceptor absorption spectrum.\n\n\nIn this assay, assembly of Ap\n1-42\n oligomer formation is monitored by FRET using N-terminal conjugates of fluorescein- Ap\n1-42\n as both the donor and acceptor fluorophore (fluorescein-fluorescein R\n0\n ~ 45 A). Ap\n1-42\n monomers assembling into oligomeric species results in a decrease of fluorescence as the fluorescein labeled Ap\n1-42\n peptides become proximal to each other and FRET efficiency increases. Inhibition OfAp\n1-42\n assembly is observed as the absence or attenuation of fluorescein quenching.\n\n\nFRET and FP assays are performed in 384-well Corning Non-Binding\n\n\nSurface, black, opaque microtiter plates, and the assay buffer consists of 25 mM MOPS-Tris (pH 8.0) with 100 mM MgCl\n2\n. The assay volume, containing 0.2 μM FITC-Aβ(l-42) and 0.8 μM Aβ(l-42), is 50 μl and the temperature is 37°C. ADDL assembly is monitored on a Tecan GENios Pro plate reader, exciting at a wavelength of 485 nm and detecting emission at a wavelength of 515 nm. Kinetic traces are collected by recording fluorescence intensity and polarization readings every five minutes over about a three hour time course. Negative control reactions, which do not appreciably assemble into ADDLs during this time, lack MgCl\n2\n but contain all other buffer and peptide components. Positive control reactions contain all buffer components in the absence of added small molecule or antibody reagents. To test for ADDL assembly inhibition, the compound was incubated with the peptide mixture at six concentrations from about 10 μM decreasing to about 0.03 μM.\n\n\nResults for the compounds of the invention that were tested in this assay are shown in Table 2 below.\n\n\nTable 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Ill - \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nExample 17\n\n\nAlternating Lever Cyclic Ratio Rat Model\n\n\nPreparations of Aβi_42 ADDLs and a potential therapeutic compound under the Alternating Lever Cyclic Ratio (ALCR) rat model of AD were tested to show in vivo efficacy. This highly sensitive model has been able to detect cognitive deficits due to direct injection of cell-derived Aβ oligomers into rat brain. Using this technique, a direct injection \n\n of ADDLs made from synthetic Ap\n1-42\n and a putative therapeutic compound under the ALCR procedure were tested.\n\n\nIn this task, rats learned a complex sequence of lever-pressing requirements in order to earn food reinforcement in a two-lever experimental chamber. Subjects alternated between two levers by switching to the other lever after pressing the first lever enough to get food reward. The exact number of presses required for each food reward changed, first increasing from 2 responses per food pellet up to 56 presses per food pellet, then decreasing back to 2 responses per pellet. Intermediate values were based on the quadratic function, x - x. One cycle was an entire ascending and descending sequence of these lever press requirements (e.g., 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 56, 42, 30, 20, 12, 6, and 2 presses per food reward). Six such full cycles were presented during each daily session. Errors were scored when the subject perseveres on a lever after pressing enough to get the food reward, i.e., did not alternate (a Perseveration Error), or when a subject switched levers before completing the response requirement on that lever (an Approach Error).\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nSynthetic Aβi_4\n2\n powder was dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluorisopropanol (HFIP) to afford a solution of Ap\n1-42\n in HFIP of about 1 mM and allowed to incubate at ambient temperature for about 1 h. The resulting solution was chilled on ice for about 5-10 min, then aliquoted into eppendorf tubes to provide about 50 μL of solution per tube. The tubes were then placed in a chemical fume hood and allowed to stand overnight to allow the HFIP to evaporate under a slow stream of nitrogen. To remove final traces of HFIP, the tubes were subjected to two SpeedVac cycles of 15 min at room temperature and about 15 to 25 mm Hg of vacuum. The resulting films of monomerized Ap\n1-42\n peptide were stored over desiccant at -80 \n0\nC until used.\n\n\nA tube of monomerized Ap\n1-42\n peptide was warmed to room temperature and the Ap\n1-42\n peptide was dissolved in anhydrous DMSO to afford a peptide stock DMSO solution containing about 10 μM to about 100 μM Ap\n1-42\n peptide in DMSO.\n\n\n2 μL of a 20 mM stock solution of test compound (Compound 2 and Compound 89 from Table 1) in anhydrous DMSO was added to an appropriate amount of \n\n neural basal media (phenol red free, Gibco 12348-017) to provide the requisite and noted concentration of the test compound in neural basal media. The concentration of the test compound is listed below in Table 3.\n\n\nFor the Ap\n1-42\n peptide only treatment, peptide stock DMSO solution was added to 37 \n0\nC neural basal to obtain the requisite Aβi_\n42\n peptide monomer concentration, provided that the maximum concentration of DMSO is 1% or less, and the tube was vortexed for 30 to 60 seconds, spun down briefly in a micro fuge and incubated at 37 \n0\nC for 15 min prior to the start of injections.\n\n\nFor the Aβ\n1-42\n peptide plus test compound treatment, peptide stock DMSO solution was added to 37 \n0\nC compound neural basal media solution to obtain the requisite Aβi_\n42\n peptide monomer concentration, provided that the maximum concentration of DMSO is 1% or less, and the tube was vortexed for 30 to 36 seconds, spun down briefly in a microfuge and incubated at 37 \n0\nC for 15 min prior to the start of injections.\n\n\nFor control injections, compound neural basal media solution was incubated at 37 \n0\nC for 15 min prior to the start of injections.\n\n\nRats: Rats are trained under ALCR until their error rates are stable. Once the rats are placed upon the final ALCR procedure, training sessions are conducted 7 days each week until the end of the study.\n\n\nSurgery: All rats received a single 28 gauge cannula, which was permanently affixed to the skull, and aimed at the lateral ventricle. Half of the rats received cannula in the right ventricle and half receive cannula in the left ventricle. Rats were allowed 5 days to recover from surgery before training resumed.\n\n\nInjection of Test Material and ALCR Testing: Test were conducted about every fourth day. Animals received a 10-20 μL injection of control, peptide, or peptide plus compound solutions via the implanted cannula over about 3 to 4 minutes. Animals were tested about 3 hours following injection. \n\n Error Rate Analysis: All error rates were compared to baseline error rates consisting of at least 3 non-treatment days temporally contiguous to the injection. Student's T test of statistical inference was used for analysis of effects.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe preservation errors and approach errors are found in Table 3 below.\n\n\nTable 3\n\n\nI nM I nM\n\n\nADDLs ADDLs 1 nM\n\n\n27 nM + 2 μM + 2 μM ADDLs 2 μM\n\n\nAβ\n1-42\n 1 nM Cmpd 1 nM Cmpd + 2 μM Cmpd 2 μM Vehicle Monomer ADDLs 89 ADDLs 89 Cmpd 2 89 Cmpd 2\n\n\nPerseveration \n1 Q6% π ?% J 33% 92% nη% 1 QJ% 1 Q5% m% 85%\n \n\n\nErrors\n\n\nApproach \n1 Q5% 1 Q5% 1 Q2% 1 QQ% U2% m% π 5% 1 Q 1% g2%\n \n\n\nErrors\n\n\nAs can be seen from Table 3, the presence of ADDLs compared to presence of vehicle or Ap\n1-42\n monomer alone, increased the Perseveration error. When ADDLs were injected along with either Compound 2 or Compound 89, the Perseveration error decreased significantly. It is contemplated that addition of one or more of the compounds will not increase or decrease error rates when given alone, but when combined with ADDLs, will eliminate the increase in Perseveration Error. Thus, it is contemplated that at least one or more of the compounds described herein will reduce errors produced by Ap\n1-42\n ADDLs.\n\n\nFrom the foregoing description, various modifications and changes in the compositions and methods will occur to those skilled in the art. All such modifications coming within the scope of the appended claims are intended to be included therein."

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to chromane substituted benzimidazole derivatives. These compounds have selective acid pump inhibitory activity. The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition, method of treatment and use, comprising the above derivatives for the treatment of disease conditions mediated by acid pump modulating activity; in particular acid pump inhibitory activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been well established that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are prodrugs that undergo an acid-catalyzed chemical rearrangement that permits them to inhibit H\n+\n/K\n+\n-ATPase by covalently binding to its Cystein residues (\nSachs, G. et. al., Digestive Diseases and Sciences, 1995, 40, 3S-23S\n; \nSachs et. al., Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol, 1995, 35, 277-305\n.). However, unlike PPIs, acid pump antagonists inhibit acid secretion via reversible potassium-competitive inhibition of H\n+\n/K\n+\n-ATPase. SCH28080 is one of such reversible inhibitors and has been studied extensively. Other newer agents (revaprazan, soraprazan, AZD-0865 and CS-526) have entered in clinical trials confirming their efficacy in human (\nPope, A.; Parsons, M., Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 1993,14, 323-5\n; \nVakil, N., Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 2004, 19, 1041-1049\n.). In general, acid pump antagonists are found to be useful for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including gastrointestinal disease, gastroesophageal disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), laryngopharyngeal reflux disease, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer; duodenal ulcer, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced ulcers, gastritis, infection of Helicobacter pylori, dyspepsia, functional dyspepsia, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, non-erosive reflux disease (NERD), visceral pain, cancer, heartburn, nausea, esophagitis, dysphagia, hypersalivation, airway disorders or asthma (hereinafter, referred as \"APA Diseases\"; \nKiljander, Toni O, American Journal of Medicine, 2003, 115 (Suppl. 3A), 65S-71S\n; \nKi-Baik Hahm et al., J. Clin. Biochem. Nutr., 2006, 38, (1), 1-8\n.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO04/054984\n \n refers to some compounds, such as indan-1-yl oxy benzimidazole derivatives, as acid pump antagonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is a need to provide new acid pump antagonists that are good drug candidates and address unmet needs by PPIs for treating diseases. In particular, preferred compounds should bind potently to the acid pump whilst showing little affinity for other receptors and show functional activity as inhibitors of acid-secretion in stomach. They should be well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, be metabolically stable and possess favorable pharmacokinetic properties. They should be non-toxic. Furthermore, the ideal drug candidate will exist in a physical form that is stable, non-hygroscopic and easily formulated.\n\n\n \n\n\n \nSummary of the Invention\n .\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn this invention, it has now been found out that the new class of compounds having a benzimidazole structure substituted with a chromane moiety show acid pump inhibitory activity and favorable properties as drug candidates, and thus are useful for the treatment of disease conditions mediated by acid pump inhibitory activity such as APA Diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a compound of the following formula (I):\n\n \n \n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or prodrug thereof, wherein;\n\n \n \n \n-A-B- represents -O-CH\n2\n-, -S-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-O- or -CH\n2\n-S-; .\n \nX represents an oxygen atom or NH;\n \nR\n1\n represents a C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl group being unsubstituted or substituted with 1 to 2 substituents independently selected from the group consisting of a hydroxy group and a C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkoxy group;\n \nR\n2\n and R\n3\n independently represent a hydrogen atom, a C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl group, a C\n3\n-C\n7\n cycloalkyl group or a heteroaryl group, said C\n1\n-C\n6\n, alkyl group, said C\n3\n-C\n7\n cycloalkyl group and said heteroaryl group being unsubstituted or substituted with 1 to 3 substituents independently selected from the group consisting of a halogen atom, a hydroxy group, a C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkoxy group, a C\n3\n-C\n7\n cycloalkyl group, an amino group, a C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkylamino group, and a di(C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl)amino group; or R\n2\n and R\n3\n taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a 4 to 6 membered heterocyclic group being unsubstituted or substituted with 1 to 2 substituents selected from the group consisting of a hydroxy group, a C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl group, a C\n1\n-C\n6\n acyl group and a hydroxy-C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl group;\n \nR\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n and R\n7\n independently represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a hydroxy group, a C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl group or a C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkoxy group; and\n \nR\n8\n represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxy group or a C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkoxy group.\n\n\nAlso, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, each as described herein, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for said compound.\n\n\nAlso, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, each as described herein, further comprising other pharmacologically active agent(s).\n\n\nAlso, the present-invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the treatment of a condition mediated by acid pump inhibitory activity, in a mammalian subject.\n\n\nExamples of conditions mediated by acid pump inhibitory activity include, but are not limited to, APA Diseases.\n\n\nFurther, the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, each as described herein, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a condition mediated by acid pump inhibitory activity.\n\n\nPreferably, the present invention also provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, each as described herein, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of diseases selected from APA Diseases.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may show good bioavailability, less toxicity, good absorption, good distribution, good half life, good solubility, less protein binding affinity other than acid pump, less drug-drug interaction, and good metabolic stability.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Description of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the compounds of the present invention:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n or R\n8\n is a C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl group, or the substituents of the 4 to 6 membered heterocyclic group are a C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl group, this C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl group may be a straight or branched chain group having one to six carbon atoms, and examples include, but are not limited to, a methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, \ntert\n-butyl, pentyl, 1-ethylpropyl and hexyl.

A pharmaceutically, acceptable salt of a compound of formula (I) may be readily prepared by mixing together solutions of the compound of formula (I) and the desired acid or base, as appropriate. The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionization in the salt may vary from completely ionized to almost non-ionized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) thereof include both unsolvated and solvated forms. The term \"solvate\" is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising a compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term 'hydrate' is employed when said solvent is water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include hydrates and solvates wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D\n2\nO, d\n6\n-acetone, d\n6\n-DMSO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncluded within the scope of the invention are complexes such as clathrates, drug-host inclusion complexes wherein, in contrast to the aforementioned solvates, the drug and host are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Also included are complexes of the drug containing two or more organic and/or inorganic components which may be in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. The resulting complexes may be ionized, partially ionized, or non-ionized. For a review of such complexes, see \nJ Pharm Sci, 64 (8), 1269-1288 by Haleblian (August 1975\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) may exist in one or more crystalline forms. These polymorphs, including mixtures thereof are also included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncluded within the scope of the present invention are all stereoisomers of the compounds of formula (I), including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism, and mixtures of one or more thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I) wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, such as \n2\nH and \n3\nH, carbon, such as \n11\nC, \n13\nC and \n14\nC, chlorine, such as \n36\nCl, fluorine, such as of, iodine, such as \n123\nI and \n125\nI , nitrogen, such as \n13\nN and \n15\nN, oxygen, such as \n15\nO, \n17\nO and \n18\nO, phosphorus, such as \n32\nP, and sulphur, such as \n35\nS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain isotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I), for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. \n3\nH, and carbon-14, i.e. \n14\nC, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. \n2\nH, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased \nin vivo\n half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as \n11\nC, \n18\nF, \n15\nO and \n13\nN, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying examples and preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagents in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso within the scope of the invention are so-called \"prodrugs\" of the compounds of formula (I). Thus certain derivatives of compounds of formula (I) which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into compounds of formula (I) having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as \"prodrugs\". Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in \nPro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T Higuchi and W Stella\n) and \nBioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed.

Some examples of prodrugs in accordance with the invention include:\n\n \n \n \n(i) where the compound of formula (I) contains an alcohol functionality (-OH), compounds wherein the hydroxy group is replaced with a moiety convertible in vivo into the hydroxy group. Said moiety convertible in vivo into the hydroxy group means a moiety transformable in vivo into a hydroxyl group by e.g. hydrolysis and/or by an enzyme, e.g. an esterase. Examples of said moiety include, but are not limited to, ester and ether groups which may be hydrolyzed easily in vivo. Preferred are the moieties replaced the hydrogen of hydroxy group with acyloxyalkyl, 1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)alkyl, phthalidyl and acyloxyalkyloxycarbonyl such as pivaloyloxymethyloxycarbonyl.\n \n(ii) where the compound of the formula (I) contains an amino group, an amide derivative prepared by reacting with a suitable acid halide or a suitable acid anhydride is exemplified as a prodrug. A particularly preferred amide derivative as a prodrug is -NHCO(CH\n2\n)\n2\nOCH\n3\n, -NHCOCH(NH\n2\n)CH\n3\n or the like.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nFurther examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll of the compounds of the formula (I) can be prepared by the procedures described in the general methods presented below or by the specific methods described in the examples section and the preparations section, or by routine modifications thereof.

For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pressurized container, pump, spray, atomizer, or nebuliser contains a solution or suspension of the compound(s) of the invention comprising, for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol, or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilising, or extending release of the active, a propellant(s) as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an oligolactic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronised to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenization, or spray drying.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCapsules (made, for example, from gelatin or HPMC), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as I-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate.

A typical formulation may comprise a compound of formula (I), propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycol include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable flavours, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium, may be added to those formulations of the invention intended for inhaled/intranasal administration. Formulations for inhaled/intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release using, for example, poly(DL-lactic-coglycolic acid) (PGLA). Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a valve which delivers a metered amount. Units in accordance with the invention are typically arranged to administer a metered dose or \"puff\" containing from about 1 to about 100 µg of the compound of formula (I). The overall daily dose will typically be in the range about 50 µg to about 20 mg which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, as divided doses throughout the day.\n\n\n \n\n\nRECTAL/INTRAVAGINAL ADMINISTRATION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be administered rectally or vaginally, for example, in the form of a suppository, pessary, or enema.

Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\n \n\n\nOTHER TECHNOLOGIES\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, \ni.e\n. as a carrier, diluent, or solubiliser. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in. \n \nWO 91/11172\n \n, \n \nWO 94/02518\n \n and \n \nWO 98/55148\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\nKIT-OF-PARTS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nInasmuch as it may be desirable to administer a combination of active compounds, for example, for the purpose of treating a particular disease or condition, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound in accordance with the invention, may conveniently be combined in the form of a kit suitable for coadministration of the compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus the kit of the invention comprises two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of formula (I) in accordance with the invention, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kit of the invention is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically comprises directions for administration and may be provided with a so-called memory aid.\n\n\n \n\n\nDOSAGE\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor administration to human patients, the total daily dose of the compounds of the invention is typically in the range of about 0.5 mg to about 300 mg depending, of course, on the mode of administration, preferred in the range of about 1 mg to about 100 mg and more preferred in the range of about 1 mg to about 20 mg. For example, oral administration may require a total daily dose of from about 1 mg to about 20 mg, while an intravenous dose may only require from about 0.5 mg to about 10 mg.

[\nWatanabe K et al., J. Physiol. (Paris) 2000; 94: 111-116\n]. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 8 weeks old, deprived of food for 18 hours before the experiment with free access to water, were anesthetized with urethane (1.4. g/kg, i.p.) and tracheotomized. After a middle abdominal incision, a dual polyethylene cannula was inserted into the forestomach and the stomach was perfused with saline (37 °C, pH 5.0) at a rate of 1 ml/min. The acid output in the perfusate was determined at 5 minutes interval by titration with 0.02 M NaOH to pH 5.0. After the determination of basal acid secretion for 30 min, the acid secretion was stimulated by a continuous intravenous infusion of pentagastrin (16 µg/kg/h). The test compounds were administered by an intravenous bolus injection or intraduodenal administration after the stimulated acid secretion reached a plateau phase. The acid secretion was monitored after the administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activity was evaluated either inhibition of total acid secretion from 0 hours to 1.5 or 3.5 hours after administration or the maximum inhibition after administration.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInhibition of gastric acid secretion in the Heidenhain pouch dog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMale Beagle dogs weighing 7 - 15 kg with Heidenhain pouch [\nHeidenhain R: Arch Ges Physiol. 1879; 19: 148-167\n] were used. The animals were allowed to recover from surgery for at least three weeks before the experiments. The animals were kept at a 12 hour light-dark rhythm, housed singly. They received standard food once daily at 11:00 a.m. and tap water ad libitum, and were fasted overnight prior to the experiment, with free access to water. Gastric juice samples were collected throughout the experiment by gravity drainage every 15 min. Acidity in the gastric juice was measured by titration to the end point of pH 7.0. Acid secretion was stimulated by a continuous intravenous infusion of histamine (80 µg/kg/h). Oral or intravenous bolus administration of the test compounds was done 90 minutes after commencement of the histamine infusion. The acid secretion was monitored after the administration. The activity was evaluated by the maximum inhibition relative to the corresponding control value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of Example 2 showed a good inhibitory activity.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHuman dofetilide binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman ether a-go-go related gene (HERG) transfected -HEK293S cells were prepared and grown in-house. Cell paste of HEK-293 cells expressing the HERG product can be suspended in 10-fold volume of 50 mM Tris buffer adjusted at pH 7.5 at 25 °C with 2 M HCl containing 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM KCl. The cells were homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer (at the maximum power for 20 seconds) and centrifuged at 48,000 g for 20 minutes at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended, homogenized and centrifuged once more in the same manner. The resultant supernatant was discarded and the final pellet was resuspended (10-fold volume of 50 mM Tris buffer) and homogenized at the maximum power for 20 seconds. The membrane homogenate was aliquoted and stored at -80°C until use. An aliquot was used for protein concentration determination using a Protein Assay Rapid Kit (wako) and Spectra max plate reader (Wallac). All the manipulation, stock solution and equipment were kept on ice at all times. For saturation assays, experiments were conducted in a total volume of 200 µl. Saturation was determined by incubating 36 µl of [\n3\nH]-dofetilide, and 160 µl of membrane homogenates (20-30 µg protein, per well) for 60 minutes at room temperature in the absence or presence of 10 µM dofetilide at final concentrations (4 µl) for total or nonspecific binding, respectively. All incubations were terminated by rapid vacuum filtration over PEI soaked glass fiber filter papers using Skatron cell harvester followed by two washes with 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4 at 25 °C). Receptor-bound radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting using Packard LS counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the competition assay, compounds were diluted in 96 well polypropylene plates as 4-point dilutions in semi-log format. All dilutions were performed in DMSO first and then transferred into 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4 at 25 °C) containing 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM KCl so that the final DMSO concentration became equal to 1%. Compounds were dispensed in triplicate in assay plates (4 µl). Total binding and nonspecific binding wells were set up in 6 wells as vehicle, and 10 µM dofetilide at final concentration, respectively. The radioligand was prepared at 5.6x final concentration and this solution was added to each well (36 µl). The assay was initiated by addition of YSi poly-L-lysine SPA beads (50 µl, 1 mg/well) and membranes (110 µl, 20 µg/well). Incubation was continued for 60 minutes at room temperature. Plates were incubated for a further 3 hours at room temperature for beads to settle: Receptor-bound radioactivity was quantified by counting Wallac MicroBeta plate counter.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCaco-2 Permeability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCaco-2 permeability was measured according to the method described in \nShiyin Yee, Pharmaceutical Research, 763 (1997\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCaco-2 cells were grown on filter supports (Falcon HTS multiwell insert system) for 14 days. Culture medium was removed from both the apical and basolateral compartments and the monolayers were preincubated with pre-warmed 0.3 ml apical buffer and 1.0 ml basolateral buffer for 0.5 hour at 37°C in a shaker water bath at 50 cycles/min. The apical buffer consisted of Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, 25 mM D-glucose monohydrate, 20 mM 2-morpholinoethanesulphonic acid (MES) Biological Buffer, 1.25 mM CaCl\n2\n and 0.5 mM MgCl\n2\n (pH 6.5). The basolateral buffer consisted of Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, 25 mM D-glucose monohydrate, 20 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethanesulfonic acid (HERPES) Biological Buffer, 1.25 mM CaCl\n2\n and 0.5 mM MgCl\n2\n (pH 7.4). At the end of the preincubation, the media was removed and test compound solution (10µM) in buffer was added to the apical compartment. The inserts were moved to wells containing fresh basolateral buffer at 1 hour. Drug concentration in the buffer was measured by LC/MS analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFlux rate (F, mass/time) was calculated from the slope of cumulative appearance of substrate on the receiver side and apparent permeability coefficient (P\napp\n) was calculated from the following equation. \n \n \n \nP\n \napp\n \n \n \n \n \ncm\n \n/\n \nsec\n \n \n=\n \n \nF\n \n×\n \nVD\n \n \n/\n \n \nSA\n \n×\n \nMD\n \n \n \n \n where SA is surface area for transport (0.3 cm\n2\n), VD is the donor volume (0.3ml), MD is the total amount of drug on the donor side at t = 0.

The reaction mixture was split into two groups, a non-P450 and a P450 group. NADPH was only added to the reaction mixture of the P450 group. An aliquot of samples of P450 group was collected at 0, 10, 30, and 60 minutes time point, where 0 minutes time point indicated the time when NADPH was added into the reaction mixture of P450 group. An aliquot of samples of non-P450 group was collected at -10 and 65 minutes time point. Collected aliquots were extracted with acetonitrile solution containing an internal standard. The precipitated protein was spun down in centrifuge (2000 rpm, 15 min). The compound concentration in supernatant was measured by LC/MS/MS system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe half-life value was obtained by plotting the natural logarithm of the peak area ratio of compounds/ internal standard versus time. The slope of the line of best fit through the points yields the rate of metabolism (k).

Wavelengths of excitation /emission were 530/595 nm, respectively.\n\nDrug-drug interaction was evaluated by the rate of metabolite formation calculated with a slope (Time vs. Fluorescence units) in the linear region or the percentage of inhibition by test compounds calculated by the following equation.\n\nInhibition % = {(v\no\n -v\ni\n)/v\no\n}x100, wherein v\no\n is a rate of control reaction (no test compounds) and v\ni\n is a rate of reaction in the presence of test compound.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n\n\nHERG\n\n\n\n\nassay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman ether a-go-go related gene (HERG) transfected HEK293 cells are prepared and cultured in-house. The methodology for stable transfection of this channel in HEK cells can be found elsewhere (\nZ.Zhou et al., 1998, Biophysical journal, 74, 230-241\n). On the day of experimentation, the cells are harvested from culture flasks and stored as cell suspension in a standard external solution (see below of its composition). in the room atmosphere of 23°C. Cells are studied between 0.5-5 hours after harvest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHERG currents are studied using a standard patch clamp technique of the whole-cell mode. During the experiment, the cells are superfused with a standard external solution of the following composition; (mM) NaCl, 130; KCI, 4; CaCl\n2\n, 2; MgCl\n2\n, 1; Glucose, 10; HEPES, 5; pH 7.4 with NaOH. Whole-cell recordings is made using a patch clamp amplifier and patch pipettes which have a resistance of 1-3MOhm when filled with the standard internal solution of the following composition; (mM); KCI, 130; MgATP, 5; MgCl\n2\n, 1; HEPES, 10; EGTA 5, pH 7.2 with KOH. Only those cells with access resistances below 10 MOhm and seal resistances over 1 GOhm are accepted for further experimentation. Series resistance compensation is applied up to a maximum of 80% without any leak subtraction. Following the achievement of whole cell configuration and sufficient time for cell dialysis with pipette solution (>5 min), the membrane is depolarized from a holding potential of - 80 mV to + 30mV for 1000 ms followed by a descending voltage ramp (rate 0.5 mV msec\n-1\n) back to the holding potential. This depolarization and ramp is applied to the cells continuously every 4 seconds (0.25 Hz). The amplitude of the peak current elicited around -40 mV during the ramp is measured. Once stable evoked current responses of minimal changes in the amplitude are obtained in the external solution, the test compound is applied for 10-20 minutes with multiple dosing in a single cell. The cells are also exposed to high dose of dofetilide (5 µM), a specific IKr blocker, to evaluate the insensitive endogenous current.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll experiments are performed at 23+/-1 °C. Evoked membrane currents are recorded online on a computer, filtered at 500-1000 Hz (Bessel -3dB) and sampled at 1-2 KHz. Osmolarity and pH change induced by the test compound in external solution will be examined at the highest concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe arithmetic mean of these ten values of peak current is calculated under control conditions and in the presence of drug. Percent decrease of I\nN\n in each experiment is obtained by the normalized current value using the following formula: I\nN\n = (I\nC\n - I\nD\n)/(I\nC\n - I\ndof\n)×100, where I\nC\n is the mean current value under control conditions, I\nD\n is the mean current value in the presence of test compound and I\ndof\n is the mean current value in dofetilide application. Separate experiments are performed and pooled data of arithmetic mean from each experiment is defined as the result of the study.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBioavailability in rat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAdult rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain were used. One to two days prior to the experiments all rats were prepared by cannulation of the right jugular vein under anesthesia. The cannula was exteriorized at the nape of the neck. Blood samples (0.2-0.3 mL) were drawn from the jugular vein at intervals up to 24 hours after intravenous or oral administrations of the test compound. The samples were frozen until analysis. Bioavailability was assessed by calculating the quotient between the area under plasma concentration curve (AUC) following oral administration or intravenous administration.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBloavailability in dog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAdult Beagle dogs were used. Blood samples (0.2-0.5 mL) were drawn from the cephalic vein at intervals up to 24 hours after intravenous or oral administrations of the test compound. The samples were frozen until analysis. Bioavailability was assessed by calculating the quotient between the area under plasma concentration curve (AUC) following oral administration or intravenous administration.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPlasma protein binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPlasma protein binding of the test compound (1 µM) was measured by the method of equilibrium dialysis using 96-well plate type equipment. Spectra-Por®, regenerated cellulose membranes (molecular weight cut-off 12,000-14,000, 22 mm x 120 mm) were soaked for over night in distilled water, then for 20 minutes in 30% ethanol, and finally for 15 minutes in dialysis buffer (Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline, pH7.4). Frozen plasma of human, Sprague-Dawley rats, and Beagle dogs were used. The dialysis equipment was assembled and added 150 µL of compound-fortified plasma to one side of each well and 150 µL of dialysis buffer to the other side of each well. After 4 hours incubation at 37°C for 150 r.p.m, aliquots of plasma and buffer were sampled. The compound in plasma and buffer were extracted with 300 µL of acetonitrile containing internal standard compounds for analysis. The concentration of the compound was determined with LC/MS/MS analysis:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fraction of the compound unbound was calculated by the following equation: \n \n \nfu\n \n=\n \n1\n \n−\n \n \n \n \n \nplasma\n \n \neq\n \n \n−\n \n \n \nbuffer\n \n \neq\n \n \n \n/\n \n \n \n \nplasma\n \n \neq\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein [plasma]\neq\n and [buffer]\neq\n are the concentrations of the compound in plasma and buffer, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAqueous solubility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAqueous solubility in the mediums (a)-(c) was determined by following method:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhatman mini-UniPrep chambers (Clifton, NJ, USA) containing more than 0.5 mg of compound and 0.5 mL of each medium were shaken overnight (over 8 hours) at room temperature. All samples were filtered through a 0.45 µm Polyvinylidene Difluoride (PVDF) membrane into the Whatman mini-UniPrep plunger before analysis. The filtrates were assayed by HPLC.\n\n<medium>(a) Simulated gastric fluid with no enzyme (SGN) at pH 1.2: Dissolve 2.0 g of NaCl in 7.0 mL of 10 M HCl and sufficient water to make 1000 mL; (b) Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at pH 6.5: Dissolve 6.35 g of KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.84 g of Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n and 5.50 g of NaCl in sufficient water to make 1000 mL, adjusting the pH to 6.5; (c) 3.94 mg of sodium taurocholate (NaTC) and 1.06 mg of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-L-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) in 1 mL of PBS (pH 6.5).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEstimation of hepatic clearance using the metabolic stability in human hepatocytes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTested compounds (1 µM) were incubated statically with hepatocytes from human at 37 °C in a 95 % air/ 5 % CO\n2\n with target cell density of 0.5 x 10\n6\n cells/ml and a total volume of 50 µL. Incubation was stopped at each time point by the addition of ice-cold acetonitrile (ACN). Aliquots of samples were mixed with 10 % ACN containing an internal standard for LC/MS/MS analysis. After samples were sonicated for 10 minutes, samples were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 15 minutes, and then the supernatant was transferred to the other plates for analysis. The compound concentrations in supernatant were measured by LC/MS/MS system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disappearance rates of tested compounds were obtained by plotting the common logarithm of the peak area ratio of compounds / internal standard versus time. The slope of the line of best fit through the points yielded the rate of metabolism (k\ne\n). This value was scaled to take hepatocellularity, liver and body weight into account to give an intrinsic clearance value (CL\nint\n) in ml/min/kg as illustrated in Equation 1. Hepatic clearance (CL\nh\n) was predicted from this intrinsic clearance value using the parallel tube model as shown in Equation 2. The predicted clearance divided by the hepatic blood flow (Q\nh\n) afforded the extraction ratio (E\nh\n) (Equation 3). \n \n \n \nk\n \ne\n \n \n×\n \n \ng liver\n \n/\n \nkg body weight\n \n \n×\n \n \nml incubation\n \n/\n \nnumber of cells in incubation\n \n \n×\n \n \ncells\n \n/\n \ng liver\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCL\n \nh\n \n \n=\n \n \nQ\n \nh\n \n \n \n \nx\n \n \n \n \n1\n \n-\n \nexp\n \n \n-\n \n \nCL\n \nint\n \n \n/\n \n \nQ\n \nh\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nE\n \nh\n \n \n=\n \n \nCL\n \nh\n \n \n/\n \n \nQ\n \nh\n \n \n \n \n Wherein, \"gliver weight /kg body weight\" is 21, \"Cells / g liver\" is 1.2 x 10\n8\n, \"ml incubation/ number of cells in incubation\" is 2.0 x 10\n-6\n, and Q\nh\n is 20 ml/min/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSupposing that hepatic metabolism is the main route of drug elimination, systemic exposure (AUC\npo\n) after oral administration is calculated using Equation 4. \n \n \n \nAUC\n \npo\n \n \n=\n \nDose x\n \n \n \n \n1\n \n-\n \n \nE\n \nh\n \n \n \n/\n \n \nCL\n \nh\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMethod for assaying the compounds phototoxic potential:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe phototoxic potential was measured in the strict accordance with method described in the OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals 432 (2002). Chlorpromazine (CPZ) and Sodium n-Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBalb/3T3, clone 3.1 cells (ATCC, CCL-163) were seeded into 96-wells plates (Nunc, 167008) at a density of 1×104 cells/well. Cells were incubated under a standard condition (37°C, a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2) within the culture medium-DMEM (GIBCO; cat#11885-084) for 24 hour. Following the incubation, the culture medium-DMEM was discarded and the cells were washed carefully with 150 µl of Earle's Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS; Sigma, Cat#E3024), then added 100 µl solution of the test compound in EBSS or solvent control (EBSS contained 1% dimethylsulphoxide or 1% ethanol). The plate was prepared in duplicate. All the plates were incubated under the standard condition for 60 min in the dark. One of the duplicated plates was used for determination of cytotoxicity (-Irr) and kept at room temperature in the dark for 50 min. For the determination of photocytotoxicity (+Irr), another one was exposed to the sun simulator (UVA irradiance: 1.7mW/cm2; SOL500, Dr. Honle UV Technology, Germany) for 50 min (UVA dose = 5 joules / cm2). Then the solutions were discarded from the two plates and immediately washed with 150 µl of EBSS with care. The cells were further incubated with 150 µl / well of DMED medium for 18 - 22 hr.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the incubation, the culture medium was discarded, the cells were washed carefully with 150 µl of EBSS and then immediately incubated with 100 µl/well of a 50 µg/ml of neutral red (NR) (3-amino-7-dimethylamino-2-methylphenazine hydrochloride, Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Japan) in DMEM without serum for 3 hour under the standard condition. After incorporation of neutral red into the cell lysosomes, the NR-DMED medium was discarded and the cells were washed carefully with 150 µl of EBSS. The exact 150 µl of ethanol/acetic acid/water (50:1:49) was added to each well of plate and the extraction was performed for 10 minutes by gently shaking at room temperature. Then optical density (OD) of the NR extract was measured at 540 nm using a spectrophotometer (Plate-reader, POLARstar OPTIMA; BMG Labtechnologies, Germany). The OD values were used to calculate the mean photo effect (MPE) value using OECD provided software \"3T3 NRU Phototox\". (Version 2.0, Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, Germany). The results for the control (CPZ and SDS) were used for the quality assurance of the assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMPE value < 0.1 was evaluated as \"no-phototoxicity\"; MPE value ≥ 0.1 and < 0.15 was evaluated as \"probable phototoxicity\" and MPE value ≥ 0.15 was evaluated as \"phototoxicity\".\n\n\n \n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples are provided for the purpose of further illustration only and are not intended to be limitations on the disclosed invention.
