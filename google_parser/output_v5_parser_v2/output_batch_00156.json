Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE(S) TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/701,589, filed Jul. 22, 2005.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present application relates to methods for screening for a chemical agent that modulates the enzymatic activity of an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase, and for identifying therapeutic agents useful for treating Metabolic Syndrome.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nMetabolic Syndrome is an increasingly common disease that is characterized by a group of metabolic risk factors that include: excessive fat tissue in and around the abdomen; blood fat disorders (e.g., high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol) that foster plaque accumulation in artery walls; raised blood pressure (typically 130/85 mm Hg, or higher); insulin resistance or glucose intolerance; an increased tendency to form blood clots (e.g., due to high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 in the blood); and elevated levels of proinflammatory proteins (e.g., elevated level of C-reactive protein in the blood).\n\n\nThe development of this syndrome is promoted by obesity, physical inactivity and genetic factors. People with Metabolic Syndrome are at increased risk of coronary heart disease, other diseases related to plaque accumulation in artery walls (e.g., stroke and peripheral vascular disease) and Type II diabetes.\n\n\nThe genetic factors that contribute to Metabolic Syndrome are not yet understood. Consequently, there is a need to identify genes that contribute to the development of Metabolic Syndrome. There is also a need for methods that permit the identification of chemical agents that modulate the activity of these genes, or the products encoded by these genes. Such chemical agents may be useful, for example, as drugs to prevent Metabolic Syndrome, or to ameliorate one or more symptoms of Metabolic Syndrome.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nAs described more fully herein, L-2-hydroxy acid oxidases are involved in lipid biochemistry. The present inventors have observed a correlation between the expression of an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase gene (called Hao 3) and certain metabolic and physical traits that are associated with Metabolic Syndrome. These traits include body weight, the amount of retroperitoneal fat in the abdomen, and the level of leptin (a hormone that contributes to the control of appetite in mammals) in the blood. Modulation of the activity of L-2-hydroxy acid oxidases in mammals may, therefore, delay or prevent the onset of Metabolic Syndrome, or ameliorate one or more symptoms of Metabolic Syndrome.\n\n\nThus, in one aspect, the present invention provides methods for screening for one or more chemical agents that modulate the enzymatic activity of an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase, the method comprising the steps of: (a) contacting an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase, in a solution in vitro, with one or more chemical agents in the presence of a substrate that is capable of being oxidized by the L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase; (b) measuring the enzymatic activity of the L-2 hydroxy acid oxidase in the presence of the chemical agent to identify one or more candidate chemical agents that modulate L-2 hydroxy acid oxidase activity in vitro; and (c) administering the one or more identified candidate chemical agents to a test animal and measuring one or more physiological parameters selected from the group consisting of body weight, body fat, retroperitoneal fat accumulation, serum level of LDL-cholesterol, serum level of HDL-cholesterol, leptin expression, and blood pressure, wherein a change in one or more physiological parameters relative to an animal not administered the candidate chemical agent is indicative of the identified candidate chemical agent possessing the ability to modulate enzymatic activity of an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase in vivo.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides methods for screening for one or more chemical agents useful for ameliorating at least one symptom of Metabolic Syndrome, the method comprising: (a) screening for one or more candidate chemical agents that inhibit the enzymatic activity of an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase in a solution in vitro; and (b) administering the inhibitory candidate chemical agents to a test animal and measuring one or more physiological parameters associated with Metabolic Syndrome, wherein a change in one or more physiological parameters relative to an animal not administered the inhibitory candidate chemical agent is indicative of utility in ameliorating at least one symptom of Metabolic Syndrome.\n\n\nThe methods of the present invention are useful, for example, for identifying candidate, therapeutic, chemical agents that delay or prevent the onset of Metabolic Syndrome, or ameliorate one or more symptoms of Metabolic Syndrome. The methods of the invention are also useful for identifying chemical agents that modulate (e.g., stimulate or inhibit) the activity of L-2-hydroxy acid oxidases, and that can be used to further elucidate the biological role of L-2-hydroxy acid oxidases in lipid biochemistry in mammals.\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\nThe foregoing aspects and many of the attendant advantages of this invention will become more readily appreciated as the same become better understood by reference to the following detailed description, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:\n\n\n \nFIG. 1A\n graphically illustrates the Km determination for human Hao2 enzyme activity against the substrate 2-hydroxyoctanoate, as described in EXAMPLE 3;\n\n\n \nFIG. 1B\n graphically illustrates the Km determination for rat Hao2 enzyme activity against the substrate 2-hydroxyoctanoate, as described in EXAMPLE 3; and\n\n\n \nFIG. 1C\n graphically illustrates the Km determination for mouse Hao3 enzyme activity against the substrate 2-hydroxyoctanoate, as described in EXAMPLE 3.\n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides methods for screening for one or more chemical agents that modulate the enzymatic activity of an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase, the method comprising the steps of: (a) contacting an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase, in a solution in vitro, with one or more chemical agents in the presence of a substrate that is capable of being oxidized by the L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase; (b) measuring the enzymatic activity of the L-2 hydroxy acid oxidase in the presence of the chemical agent to identify one or more candidate chemical agents that modulate L-2 hydroxy acid oxidase activity in vitro; and (c) administering the one or more identified candidate chemical agents to a test animal and measuring one or more physiological parameters selected from the group consisting of body weight, body fat, retroperitoneal fat accumulation, serum level of LDL-cholesterol, serum level of HDL-cholesterol, leptin expression, and blood pressure, wherein a change in one or more physiological parameters relative to an animal not administered the candidate chemical agent is indicative of the identified candidate chemical agent possessing the ability to modulate enzymatic activity of an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase in vivo.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “chemical agent” encompasses any chemical molecule or chemical element, or combination of chemical molecules and/or chemical elements. For example, the term “chemical agent” encompasses proteins (comprising at least 100 covalently linked amino acid units) and peptides (comprising from two to 99 covalently linked amino acid units).\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase” refers to an enzyme that oxidizes a 2-hydroxy acid to form a 2-keto acid with the concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. Examples of 2-hydroxy acids that can be oxidized by an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase include glycolate, L-2 hydroxy-octanoate, mandelate, and long chain 2-hydroxy fatty acids, such as 2-hydroxypalmitate. L-2-hydroxy acid oxidases use a flavin cofactor. By way of example, SEQ ID NO:1 sets forth the sequence of an mRNA molecule (isolated from \nMus musculus\n, and publicly available in the GENBANK® database under accession number NM 019545.2, also listed in GENBANK® as AK018684) that encodes the L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase (referred to as Hao3) having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2. Again by way of example, SEQ ID NO:3 sets forth the sequence of an mRNA molecule (isolated from \nRattus norvegicus\n, and publicly available in the GENBANK® database under accession number NM 032082.1) that encodes the L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase (referred to as Hao2) having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:4. By way of further example, SEQ ID NO:5 sets forth the sequence of an mRNA molecule (isolated from \nHomo sapiens\n, and publicly available in the GENBANK® database under accession number NM 016527.2) that encodes the L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase (referred to as Hao2) having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:6.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, L-2-hydroxy acid oxidases useful in the practice of the present invention are at least 70% identical (e.g., at least 80% identical, or at least 90% identical, at least 95% identical, at least 99% identical) to the L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, while retaining enzymatic activity.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, L-2-hydroxy acid oxidases useful in the practice of the present invention are at least 70% identical (e.g., at least 80% identical, or at least 90% identical, at least 95% identical, at least 99% identical) to the L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:6, while retaining enzymatic activity.\n\n\nThe term “percent identity” or “percent identical” when used in connection with the L-2-hydroxy acid oxidases used in the present invention, is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate protein sequence, that are identical with a subject protein sequence (such as the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:6), after aligning the candidate and subject sequences to achieve the maximum percent identity. For example, percentage identity between two protein sequences can be determined by pairwise comparison of the two sequences using the bl2seq interface at the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), U.S. National Library of Medicine, 8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Md. 20894, U.S.A. The bl2seq interface permits sequence alignment using the BLAST tool described by Tatiana A., et al., “Blast 2 Sequences—A New Tool for Comparing Protein and Nucleotide Sequences,” \nFEMS Microbiol. Lett. \n174:247-250, 1999. The following alignment parameters are used: Matrix=BLOSUM62; Gap open penalty=11; Gap extension penalty=1; Gap×dropff=50; Expect=10.0; Word size=3; and Filter=off.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “enzymatic activity of an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase” refers to the ability of an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase to oxidize a 2-hydroxy acid and thereby form a 2-keto acid.\n\n\nModulation of the enzymatic activity of an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase encompasses any change in the enzymatic activity of the L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase. For example, the change can be a decrease in the enzymatic activity of L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase (e.g., complete, or substantially complete, inhibition of the enzymatic activity of L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase). Again by way of example, the change can be a reduction in the rate of enzymatic activity of L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase. Again by way of example, the change can be an increase in the activity of L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase.\n\n\nIn the practice of the invention, an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase is contacted, in a solution in vitro, with a chemical agent in the presence of a substrate that is capable of being oxidized by the L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase (such as a 2-hydroxy acid). For example, an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase can be dissolved in an aqueous solution and a chemical agent can be added to the solution; or an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase can be added to a solution containing a chemical agent to be tested. The L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase can be completely purified from other components, or partially purified from other components, or can, for example, be present in a crude lysate obtained from cells that express L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase.\n\n\nL-2-hydroxy acid oxidases useful in the practice of the present invention can be isolated, for example, by expressing nucleic acid molecules encoding an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase in a suitable host cell, such as \nE. coli\n. By way of representative example, a nucleic acid molecule (such as a cDNA molecule) encoding an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase is cloned into a plasmid vector, such as a Bluescript plasmid (available from Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, Calif.). The recombinant vector is then introduced into an \nE. coli \nstrain (such as \nE. coli \nXL1-Blue, also available from Stratagene, Inc.) and the protein encoded by the nucleic acid molecule is expressed in \nE. coli \nand then purified. For example, \nE. coli \nXL1-Blue harboring a Bluescript vector including a cDNA molecule of interest is grown overnight at 37° C. in LB medium containing 100 μg ampicillin/ml. A 50 μl aliquot of the overnight culture is used to inoculate 5 ml of fresh LB medium containing ampicillin, and the culture grown at 37° C. with vigorous agitation to A\n600\n=0.5 before induction with 1 mM IPTG. After an additional two hours of growth, the suspension is centrifuged (1000×g, 15 min, 4° C.), the media removed, and the pelleted cells resuspended in 1 ml of cold buffer that preferably contains 1 mM EDTA and one or more proteinase inhibitors. The cells can be disrupted by sonication with a microprobe. The chilled sonicate is cleared by centrifugation and the expressed L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase purified from the supernatant by art-recognized protein purification techniques.\n\n\nRepresentative examples of art-recognized techniques for purifying, or partially purifying, proteins from biological material, such as from prokaryotic cells that express the desired protein(s), are: exclusion chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, reversed-phase chromatography and immobilized metal affinity chromatography.\n\n\nExample 2 herein describes an exemplary method for the expression and purification of exemplary L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase enzymes useful in the practice of the present invention.\n\n\nTypically, the effect of a chemical agent on the enzymatic activity of the L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase is determined by monitoring the oxidation of a substrate and/or product of a reaction catalyzed by the oxidized substrate (e.g. the coupled reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol). For example, if a product of a reaction catalyzed by the oxidized substrate absorbs light at one or more wavelengths is used, then the decrease in the amount of light absorption by the product, as the product is converted, can be measured. Conversely, if the product absorbs light at one or more wavelengths, then the increase in the amount of light absorption by the product, as oxidized substrate converts the product, can be measured.\n\n\nAn assay for assessing the effect of a chemical agent on L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase activity typically includes at least one experimental treatment wherein an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase is contacted with a chemical agent, and a control treatment wherein an aliquot of the same preparation of L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase used in the experimental treatment is treated identically to the L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase used in the experimental treatment, except that the L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase used in the control treatment is not contacted with the chemical agent. Comparison of the L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase activity in the experimental treatment(s) with the L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase activity in the control treatment(s) permits determination of whether the chemical agent modulates L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase activity. For example, a level of L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase activity that is significantly lower in the experimental treatment(s) compared to the control treatment(s) indicates that the chemical agent inhibits L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase activity. Again by way of example, a level of L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase activity that is significantly higher in the experimental treatment(s) compared to the control treatment(s) indicates that the chemical agent stimulates L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase activity.\n\n\nNumerous assays (e.g., hundreds or thousands) for assessing the effect of a chemical agent on L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase activity can be automated and conducted simultaneously.\n\n\nIn the practice of the claimed methods, the modulating effect of a chemical agent on L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase is validated in vivo. The in vivo validation comprises administering the one or more candidate chemical agents identified in an in vitro assay to a test animal and measuring one or more physiological parameters associated with Metabolic Syndrome wherein a change in one or more physiological parameters relative to an animal not administered the candidate chemical agent is indicative of the identified candidate chemical agent possessing the ability to modulate enzymatic activity of an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase in vivo.\n\n\nThe validation step shows that a chemical agent that modulates the activity of L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase in vitro, also causes a significant improvement in a phenotype, in vivo, associated with Metabolic Syndrome (e.g., the chemical agent causes one or more of the following changes: lowers LDL cholesterol, raises HDL cholesterol, lowers body weight, decreases the rate of body weight gain in response to a diet high in fat, decreases insulin resistance, decreases the tendency to form blood clots, and/or decreases the amount of proinflammatory proteins in blood).\n\n\nAnimal models can be used to validate the efficacy of a chemical agent that modulates the activity of L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase in vitro. The chemical agent may be administered to the animal via any suitable route of administration using techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, the chemical agent may be administered in a pharmaceutical composition. Conventional methods, known to those of ordinary skill in the art of medicine, can be used to administer the pharmaceutical composition to the mammalian subject via conventional routes (e.g., oral, subcutaneous, intrapulmonary, transmucosal, intraperitoneal, intrauterine, sublingual, intrathecal or intramuscular routes) by standard methods. For example, a chemical agent may be combined or admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, vehicle or diluent, which may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, and the like. An exemplary dose of chemical agent is in the range of from about 0.001 to about 200 mg per kg of subject's body weight per day, preferably about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg/day, or about 1 to 35 mg/kg/day. Alternatively, dosages may be administered on a periodic basis, such as once every other day (e.g., from 0.05 to 100 mg/kg every other day).\n\n\nFor example, the effect of a chemical agent on blood pressure can be directly determined using, for example, a radiotelemetry technique (see, e.g., Mills, P. A., et al., “A New Method for Measurement of Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, and Activity in the Mouse by Radiotelemetry,” \nJ. Appl. Physiol. \n88(5):1537-1544, 2000). Again by way of example, the effect of a chemical agent on blood pressure can be indirectly determined using, for example, a tail-cuff technique (see, e.g., Van Vliet, B. N., et al., “Direct and Indirect Methods Used to Study Arterial Blood Pressure,” \nJ. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods \n44(2):361-373, 2000).\n\n\nAgain by way of example, the effect of a chemical agent on body weight can be determined using an obesity model wherein obesity is induced by a high fat diet, or by using a obese mutant mouse model (e.g., ob/ob mice) (see, e.g., Tschop, M., and M. L. Heiman, “Rodent Obesity Models: an Overview,” \nExp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes, \n109(6):307-319, 2001).\n\n\nBy way of further example, the effect of a chemical agent on a component of Type II diabetes can be measured using a streptozotocin-induced diabetic model, or, for example, by using a spontaneous mutant model such as the obese Zucker rats (fa/fa rats) or the db/db mice (see, e.g., Methe, D., “Dyslipidemia and Diabetes: Animal Models,” \nDiabetes Metab. \n21(2):106-111, 1995).\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method for screening for one or more chemical agent useful for ameliorating at least one symptom of Metabolic Syndrome, the method comprising: (a) screening for one or more candidate chemical agents that inhibit the enzymatic activity of an L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase in a solution in vitro; and (b) administering the inhibitory candidate chemical agents to a test animal and measuring one or more physiological parameters associated with Metabolic Syndrome, wherein a change in one or more physiological parameters relative to an animal not administered the inhibitory candidate chemical agent is indicative of utility in ameliorating at least one symptom of Metabolic Syndrome.\n\n\nThe following examples merely illustrate the best mode now contemplated for practicing the invention, but should not be construed to limit the invention.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nThis example describes the results of the genetic analysis of mice, having altered fat and metabolic characteristics, that shows a positive correlation between Hao 3 gene expression and various traits related to Metabolic Syndrome.\n\n\nAnalysis of data pools from a genetic molecular profiling study of a C57BL/6J×DBA/2J cross indicated that expression of Hao3 may be linked to fat traits and body weight. In this cross study, female C57B1/6J mice were mated to male DBA/2J mice, and the F1s were intercrossed to produce F2 animals. Only female mice from the F2 cross were used for subsequent study. Strain C57BL/6J has an elevated susceptibility to atherosclerosis, while strain DBA/2J has a reduced susceptibility to atherosclerosis. Thus, the progeny of a cross of these two strains include a broad range of susceptibility to atherosclerosis. The F2 mice were fed an atherogenic diet that promotes atherosclerosis. The C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains, and the atherogenic diet, are described in Schadt, et al., \nNature \n422(6929):297-302, Mar. 20, 2003, which publication is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nA gene for which there are overlapping expression Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) and clinical QTLs with respect to a particular phenotypic trait may be causally related to the trait. Table 1 shows the correlation between expression of the Hao3 gene in the liver and different traits that are relevant to Metabolic Syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nvalues used\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngene\n\n\ntrait\n\n\ncorr\n\n\npvalues\n\n\nfor corr calc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAK018684\n\n\nlivebwt\n\n\n0.579935\n\n\n2.46E−11\n\n\n111\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Hao3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAK018684\n\n\nretrog\n\n\n0.532694\n\n\n2.46E−11\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Hao3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAK018684\n\n\nsqrtretrog\n\n\n0.58746\n\n\n1.0736E−07 \n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Hao3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAK018684\n\n\nsqrtlep\n\n\n0.676556\n\n\n8.88E−16\n\n\n108\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Hao3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAK018684\n\n\nlep\n\n\n0.580113\n\n\n4.54E−11\n\n\n108\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Hao3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following abbreviations are used in Table 1: Livebwt, live body weight; retrog, retroperitoneal fat; sqrtretrog, square root of retroperitoneal fat; lep, leptin; sqrtlep, square root of leptin; con, correlation of gene expression levels to trait; pvalues, significance of correlation; values used for con calc, number of animals used in calculations.\n\n\nAnalysis of the data shown in Table 1 showed that Hao3 gene expression in mouse liver is positively correlated with the traits, related to Metabolic Syndrome, that are listed in Table 1, and may be causal for retroperitoneal fat accumulation and body weight increase in the mice fed anatherogenic diet.\n\n\nA potential link between expression of Hao3 and certain body fat traits, and body weight, was also discovered by molecular genetic profiling analysis of the data pools from a cross between C57BL/6J apoE−/− mice and C3H apoE−/− mice. Both of these mouse strains have deletions in the ApoE gene, and have an increased tendency to develop atherosclerosis. C57BL/6J apoE−/− mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. C3H apoE−/− mice were generated by backcrossing C57BL/6J apoE−/− mice for 10 generations. F1 mice were generated from reciprocal intercrossing between C57BL/6J apoE−/− mice and C3H apoE−/− mice, and F2 mice were subsequently bred by intercrossing F1 mice.\n\n\nA total of 334 F2 mice (165 male and 169 female) from this cross were placed on a medium high fat diet for 4 months. The mice were genotyped with respect to about 1500 markers, and liver, adipose tissue and brain were profiled for mRNA expression levels. In addition to fat traits and body weight, a number of other clinical traits, including total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL-cholesterol were also scored. These data were used to generate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for both the traditional clinical values (cQTL) as well as QTLs for gene expression (eQTL). Correlation of expression of a gene to individual traits was also calculated (“trait-gene correlation”).\n\n\nA causal correlation was observed between expression of Hao3 in the liver and various traits associated with Metabolic Syndrome, including the level of leptin expression, the amount of body fat, the amount of retroperitoneal fat, and body weight.\n\n\nFurthermore, results from this cross study also revealed an inverse correlation between expression levels of Hao3 in the liver and serum levels of HDL-cholesterol and the ratio of HDL/LDL-cholesterol.\n\n\nA strong gender bias was observed in the genetics of Hao3 in the F2 progeny of the C57BL/6J×DBA/2J cross. Hao3 had many ecQTL overlaps with multiple metabolic traits, but the only overlap that was causal in the C57BL/6J×DBAI2J cross was with total fat in female liver.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nThis example describes the expression and purification of a mouse and human L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase useful in the practice of the present invention.\n\n\nPreparation of Human Hao2 and Mouse Hao3 Enzymes:\n\n\nThe cDNAs encoding human Hao2 (SEQ ID NO:5) and mouse Hao3 (SEQ ID NO:1) can be purchased from Invitrogen Corporation (Carlsbad, Calif.) These cDNAs encode the full amino acid sequences of a human Hao2 protein (SEQ ID NO:6) and mouse Hao3 protein (SEQ ID NO:2), respectively, and also include a TAG stop codon. The clones are supplied in the Gateway® entry vector, pENTR221, which facilitates the transfer into any of the Gateway® destination vectors. The Gateway® Technology allows for genetic analysis and expression in a multitude of systems (bacterial, mammalian, yeast, or insect).\n\n\nSite specific recombination occurs between the entry clone and the Gateway® destination vector, pcDNA™ 6.2/GFP-DEST (Invitrogen). This destination vector utilizes the Tag-On-Demand™ system which allows expression of both native and C-terminally-tagged recombinant protein from the same expression construct. Thus, the Hao2 cDNA (SEQ ID NO:5) or Hao3 cDNA (SEQ ID NO:1) entry clones undergo site-specific recombination with the destination vector, pcDNA™ 6.2/GFP-DEST, and the subsequent expression clones are transfected into CHO-K1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) using the Amaxa nucleofector technology (Amaxa Biosystems, Gaithersburg, Md.) When stable cell lines are created, the protein is constitutively expressed and may be examined by enabling the Tag-On-Demand™ System Suppressor Supernatant (Invitrogen). The Tag-On-Demand™ System allows translation of the TAG stop codon to a serine, thus enabling translation to continue through the GFP coding region of the expression construct. Confocal microscopy may be used to determine recombinant protein localization within the cells.\n\n\nSimilarly, the Hao2 or Hao3 entry clones are recombined with the Gateway®-adapted destination vector pDEST™ 26, fusing a 6×-HIS tag to the N-terminus of the protein. The subsequent pDEST™ 26 expression clone is transfected into CHO-K1 cells and a stable cell line is selected. The 6×-HIS tagged protein is overexpressed and purified using the ProBond™ nickel chelating resin (Invitrogen). The recombinant proteins bound to the resin may be eluted under either native or denaturing conditions for subsequent enzyme characterization.\n\n\nCloning of cDNAs Encoding Human Hao2 and Mouse Hao3 Enzymes:\n\n\nThe full length cDNAs encoding human Hao2 (SEQ ID NO:5) and mouse Hao3 (SEQ ID NO:1) were cloned from human or mouse kidney marathon-ready cDNA provided by Clontech (Mountain View, Calif.). These cloned cDNAs encoded the full length amino acid sequences of human Hao2 protein (SEQ ID NO:6) and mouse Hao3 protein (SEQ ID NO:2).\n\n\nMethods:\n\n\nThe PCR reactions were carried out using the following parameters in a final concentration in a 50111 volume:\n\n\n1×PCR supermix high fidelity (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.)\n\n\n4 μl of species pertinent marathon-ready cDNA\n\n\n400 nM Forward Primer\n\n\n400 nM Reverse Primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse Hao2 Primers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForward: 5′-GCGGGATCCATGTCTTTGCTGTGTTTGGCAGACT-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReverse: 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTTATAATCTGGAGAACTGAAT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAGGT-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Hao2 Primers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForward: 5′-GCGGGATCCATGTCCTTGGTGTGTCTGACAGAC-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReverse: 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTTATAATCTGGAGAACTGAAT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAGGT-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCR amplification was carried out as follows: 94° C. for 1 minute followed by: 5 cycles of 94° C. for 30 seconds, 58° C. for 30 seconds, and 72° C. for 2 minutes and 30 seconds, 25 cycles of 94° C. for 30 seconds, 68° C. for 30 seconds, and 72° C. for 2 minutes and 30 seconds and a final extension at 72° C. for 7 minutes.\n\n\nThe human Hao2 and mouse Hao3 cDNA PCR fragments were subsequently purified by the QIAQUICK® PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) to prepare for cloning into a vector. The human Hao2 cDNA was cloned into pMAL-c2E (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Mass.), and the mouse Hao3 cDNA was cloned into pET28a (Novagen, Madison, Wis.), as described below.\n\n\nHuman Hao2:\n\n\nPurified, full length cDNA encoding human Hao2 and the vector pMAL-c2E were digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and Sal I (Invitrogen) overnight at 37° C. The digested human Hao2 and pMAL-c2E vectors were purified after running the fragments on a 1% agarose gel using the DNA gel extraction kit (Millipore, Billerica, Mass.). Human Hao2 was next ligated into pMAL-c2E by T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) and transformed into TOP-10 \nE. coli \ncompetent cells (Invitrogen) and grown overnight on plates containing LB agar under the selection of 100 μg/ml ampicillin (K-D Medical, Inc. Columbia, Md.) at 37° C. Positive colonies were picked and grown in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to prepare for plasmid purification using QIAPREP® spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). Aliquots of purified plasmids were digested by BamHI and SalI and run on a 1% agarose gel to identify the clones containing the human Hao2 gene. Bacterial clones containing the proper plasmid and human Hao2 insert were grown in 100 ml of LB broth under the selection of 100 μg/ml ampicillin and plasmid DNA was purified using the Qiagen plasmid midi kit and double strand sequenced (Genewiz, Inc., North Brunswick, N.J.) to confirm accuracy. The plasmid containing the full length human Hao2 sequence was called MBP-huHAO2 and contained a maltose binding protein-Hao2 fusion protein.\n\n\nPurified MBP-huHAO2 expression vector was next transformed into BL21-codonplus-RIPL competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) and grown overnight in 10 ml LB broth containing 100.1 g/ml ampicillin at 37° C. with constant shaking. 5 ml of the overnight culture was transferred to 500 ml of the same selection medium pre-warmed to 37° C. and incubation continued at 37° C. with shaking until the OD600 reached 0.5-1.0. IPTG was added into the culture at a final concentration of 0.5 mM to induce MBP-huHAO2 expression and the incubation continued at 37° C. for an additional 3 hours with constant shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000×g for 25 minutes at 4° C. and the pellet was stored at −80° C.\n\n\nThe BL21 cell pellet containing MBP-huHAO2 (net weight 6-8 g) was resuspended in 35 ml of ice cold column buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, provided by Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) supplemented with 0.4 ml protease inhibitor cocktail set II (Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif.) and lysed by French Press at 4° C. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 12,000×g for 30 minutes at 4° C. and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh 50 ml Falcon tube (BD Biosciences, Bedford, Mass.) and stored on ice. 50% slurry amylose resin (New England Biolabs) was equilibrated with column buffer and a 7 ml volume was added to the supernatant and the 50 ml tube shook for 1 hour at 4° C. The cell lysate-amylose resin mixture was transferred to an ECONO-PAC® column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) and the supernatant was allowed to flow through. The remaining amylose beads bound with MBP-huHAO2 fusion protein were washed three times with 20 ml of column buffer and the MBP-huHAO2 protein was eluted with 5 additions of 2 ml elution buffer (column buffer containing 10 mM maltose, provided by Sigma-Aldrich). The protein was detected by the Bio-Rad protein assay and the fractions containing the fusion protein were combined (approximately a 4 ml volume). Glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 10% and the solution was mixed well, aliquotted at 200 μl per tube, and stored at −80° C.\n\n\nMouse Hao2:\n\n\nPurified, full-length cDNA encoding mouse Hao3 and the vector pET28a were digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and NotI (Invitrogen) overnight at 37° C. The digested mouse Hao3 and pET28a vector were purified, ligated, and transformed into TOP-10 \nE. coli \ncompetent cells (Invitrogen) as described above for the MBP-huHAO2 with the exception of 30 μg/ml Kanamycin (Invitrogen) as the selection agent. Again, identical to the protocol described for MBP-huHAO2, positive colonies were picked, minipreps were grown and screened by BamHI and NotI restriction digestion, and run on a 1% agarose gel. As mentioned above, bacterial clones containing the proper plasmid and mouse Hao3 insert were grown in a 100 ml volume under selection for midi-prep production and sequencing to confirm accuracy. The plasmid that contained the full length mouse Hao3 sequence was called pET28a-muHAO3 and encoded a histidine tagged-Hao2 fusion protein.\n\n\nPurified pET28a-muHAO3 plasmid was transformed into BL21-codonplus-RIPL competent cells and the cells were cultured and a cell pellet harvested exactly as described for MBP-huHAO2 with the exception of the selection agent being 30 μg/ml kanamycin.\n\n\nThe BL21 cell pellet containing His-muHAO3 (wet weight 6-8 g) was purified using the Ni-NTA purification system (Invitrogen). Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in 35 ml of ice cold native binding buffer (native purification buffer (50 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4 \nat pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl) plus 10 mM imidazole at pH 8.0) supplemented with 0.4 ml of protease inhibitor cocktail set II. Cells were lysed by French Press at 4° C. and the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000×g for 30 minutes at 4° C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh 50 ml Falcon tube and stored on ice. Ni-NTA agarose resin was equilibrated with native binding buffer and a 5 ml volume was added to the cell lysate and incubated at 4° C. with gentle shaking for 45 minutes. The cell lysate-Ni NTA resin mixture was transferred to an ECONO-PAC® column and the supernatant was allowed to flow through. The remaining resin bound with His-muHAO3 protein was washed three times with 20 ml of native washing buffer and the His-muHAO3 protein was eluted by five additions of 2 ml native elution buffer (native purification buffer plus 250 mM imidazole). Finally, the protein was detected, pooled, and aliquotted exactly as described for MBP-huHAO2.\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nThis example describes an assay that can be used to measure L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase activity in vitro.\n\n\nMeasurement of Hydroxyl Acid Oxidase:\n\n\nThe hydroxyl acid oxidase activity of the Hao enzymes was assayed for oxidation of the enzyme substrate 2-hydroxyoctanoate by monitoring the coupled reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP) at 605 nm.\n\n\nIn order to determine the Km of the enzyme for a given substrate, 20 μl/well of various concentrations of the substrate 2-hydroxyoctanoate were diluted in the assay buffer (100 mM Kpi, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1% BSA) and 175 μl/well of 50 μM 2-6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP) diluted in the same assay buffer was added to a 96-well plate. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μl/well of the Hao enzyme, and the change in A605 at room temperature (18° C.) was measured over time. Km values were obtained by plotting the substrate concentration [S] versus reaction rates [S]/v, as shown in \nFIGS. 1A-C\n. An extinction coefficient of 110.26 μM\n−1 \ncm\n−1 \nfor DCIP at 605 nm may be used for all calculations. One unit of activity may be defined as the reduction of 1 μmol of DCIP in 1 min (see Jones, J. M., et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n275:12590-12597, 2000).\n\n\nResults:\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 1A\n, human Hao2 enzyme activity against the substrate 2-hydroxyoctanoate had a Km=735 μM. As shown in \nFIG. 1B\n, rat Hao2 enzyme activity against the substrate 2-hydroxyoctanoate had a Km=43 μM. As shown in \nFIG. 1C\n, mouse Hao3 enzyme activity against the substrate 2-hydroxyoctanoate had a Km=76 μM.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nThis example describes an in vitro assay for screening inhibitors of the Hao enzyme.\n\n\nMethods:\n\n\nThe following in vitro assay was carried out to screen for inhibitors of the Hao enzyme. 20 μl/well of substrate in the assay buffer (100 mM Kpi, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1% BSA), with a final reaction concentration corresponding to the level equivalent to its respective Km (as described in EXAMPLE 3) was added to a 96-well plate. 2 μl/well of a range of concentrations of a candidate inhibitory compound were dissolved in 100% DMSO, for a final concentration of 1%. 173 μl/well of 50 μM 2-6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP) diluted in the same assay buffer was added to the 96-well plate. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μ/well of the Hao enzyme, and the change in A605 at room temperature (18° C.) was measured over time. The IC\n50 \nof the compounds that were identified as inhibitors of Hao enzyme were obtained by plotting the compound concentration versus reaction rates.\n\n\nResults:\n\n\nHao inhibitory compounds were identified using the assay described above. IC50 values of exemplary Hao inhibitory compounds are listed below in TABLE 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary Hao Inhibitory compounds against mouse Hao3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nIC50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound A\n\n\n447\n\n\nnM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound B\n\n\n1.4\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound C\n\n\n1.72\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound D\n\n\n3.28\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hao inhibitory compounds identified using the described methods may be used to modulate the activity of L-2-hydroxy acid oxidases in mammals in order to ameliorate one or more symptoms associated with Metabolic Syndrome.\n\n\nWhile the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."

Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nHeparin and heparan sulfate represent a class of glycosaminoglycans characterized by a linear polysaccharide of D-glucosamine linked to hexuronic acid (Linhardt, R. J. (1991) Chem. Ind. 2, 45-50; Casu, B. (1985) Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 43, 51-134). Heparin and heparan sulfate are complex carbohydrates that play an important functional role in the extracellular matrix of mammals. These polysaccharides modulate and regulate critical biochemical signaling pathways which impinge on normal physiological processes such as cell and tissue morphogenesis, cell-cell interactions, and growth and differentiation. These polysaccharides also play a critical role in various pathologies including wound healing, tumor growth and metastasis, certain neurodegenerative disorders and microbial pathogenesis, to name a few.\n\n\nMuch of the current understanding of heparin and heparan sulfate sequence has relied on studies of their biosynthesis (Linhardt, R. J., Wang, H. M., Loganathan, D., and Bae, J. H. (1992) Biol. Chem. 267, 2380-2387; Lindahl, U., Feingold, D., and Roden, L. (1986) Trends Biochem. Sci. 11, 221-225; Jacobson, I., and Lindahl U. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 5094-5100; Lindahl, U., and Kjellen, L. (1987) in The Biology of Extracellular Matrix Proteoglycans (Wight, T. N., and Mecham R., eds) pp. 59-104, Academic Press, New York).\n\n\nHeparan sulfate, which is chemically related to heparin, is present on the cell surface and within the extracellular matrix (ECM) of virtually every mammalian cell type. These heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (HLGAGs) are present in this extracellular environment as protein-polysaccharide conjugates known as proteoglycans. It is increasingly recognized that HLGAGs play much more than a mere structural role as they interact in a functional manner with numerous proteins of the extracellular matrix, such as laminin, fibronectin, integrins, and collagen. As such, HLGAGs (as part of proteolycans) help to define the biological properties of the matrix. These HLGAGs also interact with an array of cytokine-like growth factors and morphogens present within the extracellular matrix by facilitating their biochemical interaction with receptors and by protecting them from proteolytic degradation. For example, heparin potentiates the biological activity of aFGF, as reported by Thornton, et al., Science 222, 623-625 (1983), possibly by potentiating the affinity of aFGF for its cell surface receptors, as reported by Schreiber, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 6138-6142 (1.985). Heparin protects aFGF and bFGF from degradation by heat, acid and proteases, as reported by Gospodarowicz and Cheng, J. Cell Physiol. 128, 475-4 84 (1986); Rosengart, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 152, 432-440 (1988); and Lobb Biochem. 27, 2572-2578 (1988). bFGF is stored in the extracellular matrix and can be mobilized in a biologically active form by the hydrolyzing activity of enzymes such as heparanase as reported by Vlodavsky, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 2292-2296 (1987) and Folkman, et al., Am. J. Pathol. 130, 393-400 (1988) and Emerson et. al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101(14): 4833-8 (2004).\n\n\nThe binding of FGF to heparan sulfate is a prerequisite for the binding of FGF to its high affinity receptor on the cell surface, as reported by Yayon, et al., Cell 64, 841-848 (1991) and Papraeger, et al., Science 252, 1705-1708 (1991). A specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan has been found to mediate the binding of bFGF to the cell surface, as described by Kiefer, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 6985-6989 (1990).\n\n\nHeparin lyases, such as heparinases, are a general class of enzymes that are capable of specifically cleaving the major glycosidic linkages in heparin and heparan sulfate. Three heparinases have been identified in \nFlavobacterium heparinum\n, a GAG-utilizing organism that also produces exoglycoronidases, glycosidases, sulfoesterases, and sulfamidases and other enzymes which further act on the lyase-generated oligosaccharide products (Yang, et al. J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1849-1857 (1987); Galliher, et al. Eur. J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 15, 252-257 (1982). These lyases are designated as heparinase I (heparinase, EC 4.2.2.7), heparinase II (heparinase II, no EC number) and heparinase III (heparinase EC 4.2.2.8). The three purified heparinases differ in their capacity to cleave heparin and heparan sulfate: Heparinase I primarily cleaves heparin, heparinase III specifically cleaves heparan sulfate; and heparinase II acts on both heparin and heparan sulfate. Several Bacteroides species (Saylers, et al. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 33, 319-322 (1977); Nakamura, et al. J. Clin. Microbiol. 26, 1070-1071 (1988)) also produce heparin lyases. A heparin lyase has also been purified to apparent homogeneity from an unidentified soil bacterium by Bohmer, et al. J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13609-13617 (1990).\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention is based, in part, on the discovery and recombinant expression of heparin sulfate glucosaminoglycan (HSGAG) lyases from \nBacteroides thetaiotaomicron\n, hereafter referred to as “\nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyases”, e.g., \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I and \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase II, useful, inter alia, in the structure-specific cleavage of heparin and/or heparan sulfate. Thus, the invention includes methods, compositions and kits with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase or functional fragments thereof and combinations of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyases or functional fragments thereof, for, e.g., characterization or modification of glycoaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparin-like glycoaminoglycans (HLGAGs), e.g., heparin and heparan sulfate. For example, the methods, compositions and kits can be used to analyze and monitor heterogeneous populations of GAGs, e.g., HLGAGs. In other aspects, the methods, compositions and kits can be used to modify the structure and/or activity of GAGs, e.g., HLGAGs.\n\n\nAccording, in one aspect, the invention features \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, e.g., \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 23; an amino acid substantially identical to the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 23; or an amino acid encoded by a nucleic acid molecule that hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NOs:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 22, wherein the nucleic acid encodes a full length \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein, or functional fragments thereof.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention features a composition that includes a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, e.g., a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, described herein. In one embodiment, the composition further comprises one or more HLGAG degrading enzyme, e.g., one or more heparinase and/or one or more HSGAG lyase polypeptide other than a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides. For example, the composition can further include one or more of: an unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (e.g., \nF. heparinum Δ\n4,5 glycuronidase; \nB. thetaiotaomicron Δ\n4,5 glycuronidase); a glucuronyl hydrolase (e.g., mammalian α-iduronidase, β-glucuronidase); a sulfohydrolase (e.g., \nF. heparinum \n2-O-sulfatase, 6-O-sulfatase, 3-O-sulfatase: \nB. thetaiotaomicron \n6-O-sulfatase; mucin desulfating enzymes; mammalian N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase; mammalian iduronic acid-2-sulfatase); a N-sulfamidase (e.g., \nF. heparinum \nN-sulfamidase; mammalian heparan-N-sulfatase); an arylsulfatase; a hexosaminidase; a glycosyl hydrolase (e.g., endo-N-acetyl glucosaminidase); a heparinase (e.g., \nFlavobacterum heparinum \nheparinase I, \nFlavobacterum heparinum \nheparinase II, \nFlavobacterum heparinum \nheparinase III, \nFlavobacterum heparinum \nheparinase IV, mammalian heparanase); and functional fragments and variants thereof. Such compositions can be used, e.g., to cleave a HLGAG such as heparin and/or heparan sulfate, e.g., to characterize a preparation of HLGAGs such as heparin and/or heparan sulfate.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention features a method of specifically cleaving an HLGAG, e.g., heparin or heparan sulfate, that includes contacting an HLGAG with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, e.g., a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, described herein. In one embodiment, the HLGAG is cleaved into di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, octa-, and/or deca-saccharides and, e.g., the method further includes determining the sequence of the di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, octa-, deca- and/or longer saccharides of the HLGAG. In one embodiment, the method further includes contacting the HLGAG with one or more HLGAG degrading enzyme, e.g., a heparinase polypeptide or a HSGAG lyase polypeptide other than a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide. For example, the HLGAG degrtading enzyme can be one or more of: an unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (e.g., \nF. heparinum Δ\n4,5 glycuronidase; \nB. thetaiotaomicron Δ\n4,5 glycuronidase); a glucuronyl hydrolase (e.g., mammalian α-iduronidase, β-glucuronidase); a sulfohydrolase (e.g., \nF. heparinum \n2-O-sulfatase, 6-O-sulfatase, 3-O-sulfatase: \nB. thetaiotaomicron \n6-O-sulfatase; mucin desulfating enzymes; mammalian N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase; mammalian iduronic acid-2-sulfatase); a N-sulfamidase (e.g., \nF. heparinum \nN-sulfamidase; mammalian heparan-N-sulfatase); an arylsulfatase; a hexosaminidase; a glycosyl hydrolase (e.g., endo-N-acetyl glucosaminidase); a heparinase (e.g., \nFlavobacterum heparinum \nheparinase I, \nFlavobacterum heparinum \nheparinase II, \nFlavobacterum heparinum \nheparinase III, \nFlavobacterum heparinum \nheparinase IV, mammalian heparanase); and functional fragments and variants thereof.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention features methods for analyzing heterogeneous populations of HLGAGs, e.g., heparin (e.g., UFH, LMWH, and synthetic heparins), and heparan sulfate, that include contacting the population with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, e.g., a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, described herein. Thus, in some aspects, the invention relates to methods and products associated with analyzing and monitoring heterogeneous populations of HLGAGs, e.g., to thus defining the structural signature and activity of heterogeneous populations of HLGAGs, using a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, e.g., a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, or functional fragment thereof, described herein.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the method includes determining the structural signature of one or more batches of an HLGAG product that has been contacted with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, e.g., a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, described herein. In some embodiments, the method further includes selecting a batch as a result of the determination. In some embodiments, the method further includes comparing the results of the determination to preselected values, e.g., a reference standard. The preselected value can be, e.g., the presence or absence or a set value (e.g., mole % or area under the curve) of one or more di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, octa-, and/or deca-saccharide associated with cleavage of the HLGAG with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, e.g., a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragment thereof, described herein.\n\n\nFor any of the methods described herein, a completely or partially \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide (or polypeptides) digested sample can be analyzed to determine the structural signature by, e.g., one or more of mass spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, reverse-phase column chromatography (e.g., HPLC, e.g., HPLC with a stationary phase dynamically coated with a quanterrnary ammonium salt), ion-pair HPLC. The methods described herein can further include digesting the sample with one or more HLGAG degrading enzyme, e.g., a heparinase or a heparin lyase polypeptide other than a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide. For example, the HLGAG degrading enzyme can be one or more of: an unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (e.g., \nF. heparinum Δ\n4,5 glycuronidase; \nB. thetaiotaomicron Δ\n4,5 glycuronidase); a glucuronyl hydrolase (e.g., mammalian α-iduronidase, β-glucuronidase); a sulfohydrolase (e.g., \nF. heparinum \n2-O-sulfatase, 6-O-sulfatase, 3-O-sulfatase: \nB. thetaiotaomicron \n6-O-sulfatase; mucin desulfating enzymes; mammalian N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase; mammalian iduronic acid-2-sulfatase); a N-sulfamidase (e.g., \nF. heparinum \nN-sulfamidase; mammalian heparan-N-sulfatase); an arylsulfatase; a hexosaminidase; a glycosyl hydrolase (e.g., endo-N-acetyl glucosaminidase); a heparinase (e.g., \nFlavobacterum heparinum \nheparinase I, \nFlavobacterum heparinum \nheparinase II, \nFlavobacterum heparinum \nheparinase III, \nFlavobacterum heparinum \nheparinase IV, mammalian heparanase); and functional fragments and variants thereof.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention features an HLGAG preparation (e.g., a heparin or heparan sulfate preparation) produced by contacting an HLGAG preparation with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, e.g., a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, described herein. In one embodiment, the HLGAG preparation (e.g., the heparin or heparan sulfate preparation) has one or more of reduced anti-Xa activity and anti-IIa activity, e.g., as compared to a reference standard, e.g., as compared to a commercially available heparin or heparan sulfate or as compared to the heparin or heparan sulfate preparation prior to contacting with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide. In some embodiments, anti-Xa activity is reduced while anti-IIa activity is maintained or increased. In other embodiments, anti-IIa activity is reduced while anti-Xa activity is maintained or enhanced. In other embodiments, anti-Xa activity and anti-IIa activity is reduced. Such preparation can be useful, e.g., for applications where reduced anti-Xa activity and/or anti-IIa activity is desirable, e.g., such as the use of heparin or heparan sulfate as a carrier for another agent, e.g., a therapeutic agent, prophylactic or diagnostic agent. Thus, in some embodiments, the HLGAG preparation can further include a second agent other than the HLGAG, e.g., the preparation can further include one or more therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic agents. In another embodiment, the HLGAG preparation (e.g., the heparin or heparan sulfate preparation) has one or more of increased anti-Xa activity and anti-IIa activity, e.g., as compared to a reference standard, e.g., as compared to a commercially available heparin or heparan sulfate or as compared to the heparin or heparan sulfate preparation prior to contacting with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide. Such preparation can be useful, e.g., for applications were increased anti-Xa activity and/or anti-IIa activity is desirable, e.g., as an anti-coagulant and/or anti-thrombotic agent.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention features a method of neutralizing one or more activities of an HLGAG (e.g., a heparin or heparan sulfate). The method includes contacting the HLGAG with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, or functional fragment thereof, e.g., a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I polypeptide, or functional fragment thereof, described herein. When the HLGAG is heparin or heparan sulfate, the activity to be neutralized can be one or more of anti-Xa activity and anti-IIa activity. In some embodiments, anti-Xa activity is reduced while anti-IIa activity is maintained or increased. In other embodiments, anti-IIa activity is reduced while anti-Xa activity is maintained or enhanced. In other embodiments, anti-Xa activity and anti-IIa activity is reduced. The HLGAG can be, e.g., contacted ex vivo or in vivo. Thus, in some embodiments, the method can include administering the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, or functional fragment thereof, to a subject in an amount effective to neutralize anti-Xa activity and/or anti-IIa activity in the subject, e.g., a subject that has been administered an HLGAG such as heparin or heparan sulfate, e.g., a subject that has been administered heparin or heparan sulfate to inhibit coagulation and/or thrombosis.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention features a method of inhibiting angiogenesis in a subject. The method includes administering to the subject an effect amount of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, e.g., a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, described herein, to thereby inhibit angiogenesis. In one embodiment, the subject has a disease or disorder associated with unwanted angiogenesis. Such disorders include, but are not limited to, arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), various eye disorders (e.g., diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, inflammatory disorders, ocular tumors (e.g., retinoblastoma), retrolental fibroplasias, uveitis as well as disorders associated with choroidal neovascularization and iris neovascularization) and cancer (e.g., tumor growth and metastases).\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention features a method of inhibiting unwanted cellular proliferation and/or differentation in a subject. The method includes administering to the subject an effect amount of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, e.g., a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides, or functional fragments thereof, described herein, to thereby inhibit cellular proliferation and/or differentiation.

Structure specific cleavage of a GAG, e.g., heparin and/or heparan sulfate, can be used, e.g., to determine the structure of GAGs in a heterogenous GAG preparation. In addition, cleavage can be used, e.g., to produce lower molecular weight oligosaccharides from the GAG. Thus, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyases can be used to generate, e.g., heparin- and heparan sulfate-derived oligosaccharides. Such heparin- and heparan sulfate-derived oligosaccharides may have diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic potential.\n\n\nIn addition, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyases described herein may also have prophylactic and therapeutic potential, e.g., in disorders associated with angiogenesis.\n\n\nThe \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyases further can be used in the ex vivo and/or in vivo to neutralize an anti-coagulant and/or anti-thrombotic activity of heparin and/or heparan sulfate.\n\n\nThe \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nheparin lyase sequence (\nFIG. 1\n; SEQ ID NO:1), which is approximately 1130 nucleotides long including untranslated regions, contains a predicted methionine-initiated coding sequence of about 1128 nucleotides, including the termination codon (nucleotides indicated as coding of SEQ ID NO:1 in \nFIG. 1\n). The coding sequence encodes a 392 amino acid protein (SEQ ID NO:2).\n\n\nA variant in which the amino terminus begins at the methinione at residue 17 (M17) can also be used to produce recombinant protein. The amino acid sequence and nucleotide sequence encoding the M17 variant of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I are depicted in \nFIGS. 3B\n (SEQ ID NO:4) and \n3\nA (SEQ ID NO:3), respectively.\n\n\nAnother variant in which the amino terminus begins at the glutamine at residue Q26 can also be used to produce recombinant protein. The amino acid sequence and nucleotide sequence encoding the Q26 variant of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I are depicted in \nFIGS. 4B\n (SEQ ID NO:23) and \n4\nA (SEQ ID NO:22), respectively.\n\n\nThe \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I protein contains a significant number of structural characteristics in common with heparinase I obtained from \nFlavobacterium heparinum. \n \n\n\nThe \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase II sequence (\nFIG. 5\n; SEQ ID NO:5), which is approximately 2001 nucleotides long including untranslated regions including the termination codon (nucleotides indicated as coding of SEQ ID NO:5 in \nFIG. 5\n). The coding sequence encodes a 666 amino acid protein (SEQ ID NO:6).\n\n\nA variant in which the amino terminus begins at the glutamine at residue 23 (Q23) can also be used to produce recombinant protein. The amino acid sequence and nucleotide sequence encoding the Q23 variant of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase II are depicted in \nFIGS. 5B\n (SEQ ID NO:8) and \n5\nA (SEQ ID NO:7), respectively.\n\n\nAnother variant in which is a deletion beginning at the lysine at residue 169 (K169) and ending at the glutamic acid at residue 186 can also be used to produce recombinant protein. The amino acid sequence and nucleotide sequence encoding the K169 variant of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase II are depicted in \nFIG. 5B\n (SEQ ID NO:10) and 5A (SEQ ID NO:9), respectively.\n\n\nThe \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase II protein contains a significant number of structural characteristics in common with heparinase III obtained from \nFlavobacterium heparinum. \n \n\n\nAs the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides of the invention may modulate heparin- and/or heparan sulfate-mediated activities, they may be useful in various prophylactic and therapeutic applications as well as for developing novel prophylactic and diagnostic agents for heparin- or heparan sulfate-mediated or related disorders.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “HSGAG lyase activity”, “biological activity of HSGAG lyase” or “functional activity of HSGAG lyase”, refers to an activity exerted by a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule in a physiological milieu. For example, a HSGAG lyase activity can be an activity exerted by \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase on e.g., on a HSGAG lyase substrate, e.g., glycosidic linkages in heparin or heparan sulfate. A HSGAG lyase activity can be determined in vivo or in vitro.\n\n\nThe \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules of the present invention are predicted to have similar biological activities to various heparinases obtained from \nFlavobacterium heparinum\n. For example, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase proteins of the present invention can have one or more of the following activities: (1) binds a heparin and/or a heparan sulfate; (2) cleaves one or more glycosidic linkages of a heparin and/or a heparan sulfate; (3) modulates, e.g., increases or reduces, anti-Xa activity and/or anti-IIa activity of a heparin and/or a heparan sulfate; and (4) reduces or eliminates angiogenesis.\n\n\nIn some aspects, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I has biological activity similar to, but not identical with, heparinase I obtained from \nFlavobacterium heparinum. \nFor example, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I can have one or more of the following activities: (1) binds a heparin and/or heparan sulfate; (2) cleaves one or more glycosidic linkages of heparin and/or heparan sulfate, e.g., cleaves one or more glycosidic linkages of sulfated uronic acids, e.g., 2-O and/or 3-O sulfated uronic acids; (3) reduces anti-Xa activity and/or anti-IIa activity of a heparin and/or a heparan sulfate, e.g., as compared to a reference standard, e.g., the anti-Xa activity and/or anti-IIa activity of a commercially available heparin or heparan sulfate or of the heparin or heparan sulfate prior to cleavage. In some embodiments, anti-Xa activity is reduced while anti-IIa activity is maintained or increased. In other embodiments, anti-IIa activity is reduced while anti-Xa activity is maintained or enhanced. In other embodiments, anti-Xa activity and anti-IIa activity is reduced.\n\n\nThus, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules, e.g., the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I molecules can act as novel therapeutic agents for controlling heparin-associated disorders. Examples of such disorders include heparin-induced anticoagulation and/or angiogenesis. For example, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules, e.g., the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I molecules, can be used to reduce or eliminate (e.g., neutralize) one or more anticoagulation properties of a heparin and/or a heparan sulfate, e.g., during or after surgery. In other embodiments, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules, e.g., \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I molecules, can be used to deheparinize blood, e.g., in a bioreactor, e.g., a bioreactor used in heart-lung and/or kidney dialysis.\n\n\nIn some aspects, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase II has biological activity similar to, but not identical with, heparinase II obtained from \nFlavobacterium heparinum. \nFor example, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase II can have one or more of the following activities: (1) binds a heparin and/or heparan sulfate; (2) cleaves one or more glycosidic linkages of heparin and/or heparan sulfate, e.g., cleaves one or more glycosidic linkages of sulfated and undersulfated uronic acids; (3) increases anti-Xa activity and/or anti-IIa activity of a heparin and/or a heparan sulfate, e.g., as compared to a reference standard, e.g., the anti-Xa activity and/or anti-IIa activity of a commercially available heparin or heparan sulfate or of the heparin or heparan sulfate prior to cleavage. In some embodiments, anti-Xa activity is increased while anti-IIa activity is maintained or reduced. In other embodiments, anti-IIa activity is increased while anti-Xa activity is maintained or reduced. In other embodiments, anti-Xa activity and anti-IIa activity are reduced.\n\n\nThus, such \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules, e.g., \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase II molecules, can be used to prepare a heparin and/or heparan sulfate preparation useful for treatment of coagulation and/or thrombosis. Examples of such disorders include dissolving or inhibiting formation of thromboses, treatment and prevention of conditions resulting from infarction of cardiac and central nervous system vessels, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, myocardial infarction, arrythmias, atrial fibrillation, angina, unstable angina, refractory angina, congestive heart failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), reocclusion or restenosis of reperfused coronary arteries, rheumatic fever, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, thrombotic stroke, embolic stroke, deep venous thrombosi, pulmonary embolism, migraine, allergy, asthma, emphysema, adult respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS), cystic fibrosis, neovascularization of the ocular space, osteoporosis, psoriasis, arthritis (rheumatoid or osteogenic), Alzheimer's disease, bone fractures, major surgery/trauma, burns, surgical procedures, transplantation such as bone marrow transplantation, hip replacement, knee replacement, sepsis, septic shock, pregnancy, hereditary disorders such as hemophilias.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules, e.g., \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase II molecules, can be used to treat or prevent cellular proliferative or differentiative disorders, e.g., by preventing or inhibiting angiogenesis of cells exhibiting or otherwise associated with unwanted proliferation and/or differentiation. Examples of cellular proliferative and/or differentiative disorders include diabetes; arthritis, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis; ocular disorders, e.g., ocular neovascularization, diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, retrolental fibroplasia, uevitis, eye disease associated with choroidal neovascularization, eye disorders associated with iris neovascularization; cancer, e.g., carcinoma, sarcoma, metastatic disorders or hematopoietic neoplastic disorders, e.g., leukemias.\n\n\nThe \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase proteins, fragments thereof, and derivatives and other variants of the sequence in SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:6 thereof are collectively referred to as “polypeptides or proteins of the invention” or “\nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides or proteins”. Nucleic acid molecules encoding such polypeptides or proteins are collectively referred to as “nucleic acids of the invention” or “\nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase nucleic acids.” “\nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules” refer to \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase nucleic acids, polypeptides, and antibodies.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “nucleic acid molecule” includes DNA molecules (e.g., a cDNA or genomic DNA), RNA molecules (e.g., an mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA. A DNA or RNA analog can be synthesized from nucleotide analogs. A DNA molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA.\n\n\nThe term “isolated nucleic acid molecule” or “purified nucleic acid molecule” includes nucleic acid molecules that are separated from other nucleic acid molecules present in the natural source of the nucleic acid. For example, with regards to genomic DNA, the term “isolated” includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from the chromosome with which the genomic DNA is naturally associated. Preferably, an “isolated” nucleic acid is free of sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5′ and/or 3′ ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb or 0.1 kb of 5′ and/or 3′ nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. Moreover, an “isolated” nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “hybridizes under stringent conditions” describes conditions for hybridization and washing. Stringent hybridization conditions are hybridization in 6× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45° C., followed by two washes in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65° C. Hybridization conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6. Aqueous and nonaqueous methods are described in that reference and either can be used. Additional examples of hybridization conditions are as follows: 1) low stringency, hybridization in 6×SSC at about 45° C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55° C.; 2) medium stringency, hybridization in 6×SSC at about 45° C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60° C.; and preferably, 3) high stringency, hybridization in 6×SSC at about 45° C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2×SSC, 0. 1% SDS at 65° C. Particularly preferred stringency conditions (and the conditions that should be used if the practitioner is uncertain about what conditions should be applied to determine if a molecule is within a hybridization limitation of the invention) are 0.5M sodium phosphate, 7% SDS at 65° C., followed by one or more washes at 0.2×SSC, 1% SDS at 65° C. Preferably, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention that hybridizes under stringent conditions to the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 corresponds to a naturally-occurring nucleic acid molecule.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “naturally-occurring” nucleic acid molecule refers to an RNA or DNA molecule having a nucleotide sequence that occurs in nature. For example a naturally occurring nucleic acid molecule can encode a natural protein.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms “gene” and “recombinant gene” refer to nucleic acid molecules which include at least an open reading frame encoding a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein. The gene can optionally further include non-coding sequences, e.g., regulatory sequences and introns.\n\n\nAn “isolated” or “purified” polypeptide or protein is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the protein is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. “Substantially free” means that a preparation of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein is at least 10% pure. In a preferred embodiment, the preparation of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein has less than about 30%, 20%, 10% and more preferably 5% (by dry weight), of non-\nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein (also referred to herein as a “contaminating protein”), or of chemical precursors or non-\nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase chemicals. When the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein or biologically active portion thereof is recombinantly produced, it is also preferably substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, more preferably less than about 10%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the volume of the protein preparation. The invention includes isolated or purified preparations of at least 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10 milligrams in dry weight.\n\n\nA “non-essential” amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase without abolishing or substantially altering a HSGAG lyase activity. Preferably, the alteration does not substantially alter the HSGAG lyase activity, e.g., the activity is at least 20%, 40%, 60%, 70% or 80% of wild-type. An “essential” amino acid residue is a residue that, when altered from the wild-type sequence of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase, results in abolishing a HSGAG lyase activity such that less than 20% of the wild-type activity is present. For example, conserved amino acid residues in \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase are predicted to be particularly unamenable to alteration.\n\n\nA “conservative amino acid substitution” is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for HSGAG lyase biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following mutagenesis of SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:5, the encoded protein can be expressed recombinantly and the activity of the protein can be determined.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “biologically active portion” of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein includes a fragment of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein which participates in an interaction, e.g., an inter-molecular interaction. An inter-molecular interaction can be a binding interaction or an enzymatic interaction (e.g., the interaction can be transient and a covalent bond is formed or broken). An inter-molecular interaction can be between a HSGAG lyase \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nmolecule and a non-\nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecule, e.g., heparin, heparan sulfate, and fragments thereof. Biologically active portions of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein include peptides comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently homologous to or derived from the amino acid sequence of the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein, e.g., the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2 and SEQ ID NO:6, which include less amino acids than the full length \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase proteins, and exhibit at least one activity of a HSGAG lyase protein. Typically, biologically active portions comprise a domain or motif with at least one activity of the HSGAG lyase protein, e.g., depolymerization of heparin, heparan sulfate, and fragments thereof (e.g., in a site specific manor); cleavage of a glycosidic linkage of heparin, heparan sulfate, and fragments thereof; reduce or eliminate an anticoagulant activity, e.g., an anticoagulant activity of heparin, heparan sulfate, and fragments thereof. A biologically active portion of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein can be a polypeptide which is, for example, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 or more amino acids in length.\n\n\nCalculations of homology or sequence identity between sequences (the terms are used interchangeably herein) are performed as follows.\n\n\nTo determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences, or of two nucleic acid sequences,.the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap needed to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. For the purposes of determining if a molecule is within a sequence identity or a homology limitation herein, percent identity is determined by the mathematical algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch ((1970) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n48:444-453) as implemented in the GAP program of the GCG software package (available at http://www.gcg.com) with the following parameters: a Blossum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% of the length of the reference sequence. The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid “identity” is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid “homology”).\n\n\nFor the purposes of analyzing a biological sequence with reference to \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules, the following alignment procedures can be used in addition to the aforementioned Needleman and Wunsch algorithm. The percent identity between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences can be determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller ((1989) CABIOS, 4:11-17) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4.\n\n\nThe nucleic acid and protein sequences described herein can be used as a “query sequence” to perform a search against public databases to, for example, identify other family members or related sequences. Such searches can be performed using the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (version 2.0) of Altschul, et al. (1990) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n215:403-10. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score =100, wordlength=12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al., (1997) \nNucleic Acids Res. \n25:3389-3402. When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.\n\n\nParticular \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides of the present invention have an amino acid sequence sufficiently identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID Nos:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 23. In the context of an amino acid sequence, the term “sufficiently identical” or “substantially identical” is used herein to refer to a first amino acid that contains a sufficient or, minimum number of amino acid residues that are i) identical to or ii) conservative substitutions of to aligned amino acid residues in a second amino acid sequence such that the first and second amino acid sequences have a common structural fold and/or a common functional activity. For example, amino acid sequences that contain a common structural domain having at least about 60%, or 65% identity, likely 75% identity, more likely 85%, 90%. 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identity are termed sufficiently or substantially identical. In the context of nucleotide sequence, the term “sufficiently identical” or “substantially identical” is used herein to refer to a first nucleic acid sequence that contains a sufficient or minimum number of nucleotides that are identical to aligned nucleotides in a second nucleic acid sequence such that the first and second nucleotide sequences have a common functional activity or encode a common structural polypeptide fold or a common functional polypeptide activity.\n\n\nThe methods taught herein are sometimes described with reference to heparin-like glycoaminoglycans (HLGAGs) but the properties taught herein can be extended to other polysaccharides. As used herein the terms “HLGAG” and “glycosaminoglycans” (GAGs) are used interchangeably to refer to a family of molecules having heparin like structures and properties, generally referred to herein as “heparin”. These molecules include but are not limited to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), unfractioned heparin, biotechnologically prepared heparin, chemically modified heparin, synthetic heparin such as pentasaccharides (e.g., ARIXTRA™), heparin mimetics and heparan sulfate. The term “biotechnological heparin” encompasses heparin that is prepared from natural sources of polysaccharides which have been chemically modified and is described in Razi et al., Bioche. J. Jul. 15, 1995;309 (Pt 2): 465-72. Chemically modified heparin is described in Yates et al., Carbohydrate Res Nov. 20, 1996; 294:15-27, and is known to those of skill in the art. Synthetic heparin is well known to those of skill in the art and is described in Petitou, M. et al., Bioorg Med Chem Lett. Apr. 19, 1999; 9(8):1161-6 and Vlodavsky et al., Int. J. Cancer, 1999, 83:424-431. An example of a synthetic heparin is fondaparinux. Fondaparinux (ARIXTRA™) is a 5 unit synthetic glycoaminoglycan corresponding to the AT-III binding site. Heparan Sulfate refers to a glycoaminoglycan containing a disaccharide repeat unit similar to heparin, but which has more N-acetyl groups and fewer N— and O-sulfate groups. Heparin mimetics are monosaccharides (e.g., sucralfate), oligosaccharides, or polysaccharides having at least one biological activity of heparin (i.e., anticoagulation, inhibition of cancer, treatment of lung disorders, etc.). Preferably these molecules are highly sulfated. Heparin mimetics may be naturally occurring, synthetic or chemically modified. (Barchi, J. J., Curr. Pharm. Des., Mar. 6, 2000 (4):485-501). The term “HLGAG” also encompasses functional variants of the above-described HLGAG molecules. These functional variants have a similar structure but include slight modifications to the structure which allow the molecule to retain most of its biological activity or have increased biological activity.\n\n\n“LMWH” as used herein refers to a preparation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) having an average molecular weight of less than 8000 Da, with about at least 60% of the oligosaccharide chains of a LMWH preparation having a molecular weight of less than 8000 Da. Several LMWH preparations are commercially available, but, LMWHs can also be prepared from heparin, using e.g., HLGAG degrading enzymes. HLGAG degrading enzymes include but are not limited to heparinase-I, heparinase-II, heparinase-III, heparinase IV, heparanase, D-glucuronidase and L-iduronidase. The three heparinases from \nFlavobacterium heparinum \nare enzymatic tools that have been used for the generation of LMWH (5,000-8,000 Da) and ultra-low molecular weight heparin (˜3,000 Da). In addition, LMWHs can be prepared using, e.g., the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptides described herein. Commercially available LMWH include, but are not limited to, enoxaparin (brand name Lovenox; Aventis Pharmaceuticals), dalteparin (Fragmin, Pharmacia and Upjohn), certoparin (Sandobarin, Novartis), ardeparin (Normiflo, Wyeth Lederle), nadroparin (Fraxiparine, Sanofi-Winthrop), parnaparin (Fluxum, Wassermann), reviparin (Clivarin, Knoll A G), and tinzaparin (Innohep, Leo Laboratories, Logiparin, Novo Nordisk). Some preferred forms of LMWH include enoxaparin (Lovenox) and dalteparin (Fragmin). The term “Arixtra” as used herein refers to a composition which includes a synthetic pentasaccharide of methyl O-2-deoxy-6-O-sulfo-2-(sulfoamino)-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-2-deoxy-3,6-di-O-sulfo-2-(sulfoamino)-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-2-O-sulfo-α-L-idopyranuronosyl-(1→4)-2-deoxy-6-O-sulfo-2-(sulfoamino)-α-D-glucopyranoside, decasodium salt and derivatives thereof. A “synthetic heparin” or “synthetic HLGAG” as used herein refers to HLGAGs are synthesized compounds and are not derived by fragmentation of heparin. Methods of preparing synthetic heparins are provided, for example, in Petitou et al. (1999) Nature 398:417, the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n“Misexpression or aberrant expression”, as used herein, refers to a non-wildtype pattern of gene expression at the RNA or protein level. It includes: expression at non-wild type levels, i.e., over- or under-expression; a pattern of expression that differs from wild type in terms of the time or stage at which the gene is expressed, e.g., increased or decreased expression (as compared with wild type) at a predetermined developmental period or stage; a pattern of expression that differs from wild type in terms of altered expression (as compared with wild type) in a predetermined cell type or tissue type; a pattern of expression that differs from wild type in terms of the splicing size, translated amino acid sequence, post-transitional modification, or biological activity of the expressed polypeptide; a pattern of expression that differs from wild type in terms of the effect of an environmental stimulus or extracellular stimulus on expression of the gene, e.g., a pattern of increased or decreased expression (as compared with wild type) in the presence of an increase or decrease in the strength of the stimulus.\n\n\n“Subject”, as used herein, refers to a mammal organism. In a preferred embodiment, the subject is a human. In another embodiment, the subject is an experimental animal or animal suitable as a disease model. Non-limiting examples of such subjects include mice, rats, and rabbits. The subject can also be a non-human animal, e.g., a horse, cow, goat, or other domestic animal.\n\n\nVarious aspects of the invention are described in further detail below.\n\n\nIsolated Nucleic Acid Molecules\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides, an isolated or purified, nucleic acid molecule that encodes a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide described herein, e.g., a full length \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein or a fragment thereof, e.g., a biologically active portion of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein. Also included is a nucleic acid fragment suitable for use as a hybridization probe, which can be used, e.g., to identify a nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide of the invention, \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase mRNA, and fragments suitable for use as primers, e.g., PCR primers for the amplification or mutation of nucleic acid molecules.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention includes the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:5, or a portion of any of these nucleotide sequences. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule includes sequences encoding the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein (i.e., “the coding region” of SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:5), as well as 5′ untranslated sequences. Alternatively, the nucleic acid molecule can include no flanking sequences which normally accompany the subject sequence. In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention includes a nucleic acid molecule which is a complement of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:5, or a portion of any of these nucleotide sequences. In other embodiments, the nucleic acid molecule of the invention is sufficiently complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:5, such that it can hybridize to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:5, thereby forming a stable duplex.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention includes a nucleotide sequence which is at least about 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or more homologous to the entire length of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:5, or a portion, preferably of the same length, of any of these nucleotide sequences.\n\n\nA nucleic acid molecule of the invention can include only a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:5. A nucleic acid includes a nucleotide sequence that includes part, or all, of the coding region and extends into either (or both) the 5′ or 3′ noncoding region. Other embodiments include a fragment which includes a nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid fragment described herein, particularly fragments thereof which are at least 100 amino acids in length. Fragments also include nucleic acid sequences corresponding to specific amino acid sequences described above or fragments thereof. Nucleic acid fragments should not to be construed as encompassing those fragments that may have been disclosed prior to the invention.\n\n\nA nucleic acid fragment encoding a “biologically active portion of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide” can be prepared by isolating a portion of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9 or 22, which encodes a polypeptide having a HSGAG lyase biological activity (e.g., the biological activities of HSGAG lyase proteins are described herein), expressing the encoded portion of the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein (e.g., by recombinant expression in vitro) and assessing the activity of the encoded portion of the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein. A nucleic acid fragment encoding a biologically active portion of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, may comprise a nucleotide sequence which is greater than 300 or more nucleotides in length.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, a nucleic acid includes a nucleotide sequence which is about 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a nucleic acid molecule of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9 or 22.\n\n\nThe invention encompasses nucleic acid molecules that differ from the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, 9 or 22. Such differences can be due to degeneracy of the genetic code (and result in a nucleic acid which encodes the same \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase proteins as those encoded by the nucleotide sequence disclosed herein. In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention has a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein having an amino acid sequence which differs, by at least 1, but less than 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100 amino acid residues that shown in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 23. If alignment is needed for this comparison the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. “Looped” out sequences from deletions or insertions, or mismatches, are considered differences.\n\n\nNucleic acids of the inventor can be chosen for having codons, which are preferred, or non-preferred, for a particular expression system. E.g., the nucleic acid can be one in which at least one codon, at preferably at least 10%, or 20% of the codons has been altered such that the sequence is optimized for expression in \nE. coli\n, yeast, human, insect, or CHO cells.\n\n\nNucleic acid variants can be naturally occurring, such as allelic variants (same locus) and homologs (different locus), or can be non naturally occurring. Non-naturally occurring variants can be made by mutagenesis techniques, including those applied to polynucleotides, cells, or organisms. The variants can contain nucleotide substitutions, deletions, inversions and insertions. Variation can occur in either or both the coding and non-coding regions. The variations can produce both conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions (as compared in the encoded product).\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid differs from that of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 or 23, e.g., as follows: by at least one but less than 10, 20, 30, or 40 nucleotides; at least one but less than 1%, 5%, 10% or 20% of the nucleotides in the subject nucleic acid. If necessary for this analysis the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. “Looped” out sequences from deletions or insertions, or mismatches, are considered differences.\n\n\nHomologs and allelic variants can be identified using methods known in the art. These variants comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide that is 50%, at least about 55%, typically at least about 70-75%, more typically at least about 80-85%, and most typically at least about 90-95% or more identical to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 23, or a fragment of these sequences. Such nucleic acid molecules can readily be identified as being able to hybridize under stringent conditions, to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2, SEQ ID NO:6, or a fragment of the sequence. Nucleic acid molecules corresponding to homologs and allelic variants of the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase DNAs of the invention can further be isolated by mapping to the same chromosome or locus as the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase gene.\n\n\nPreferred variants include those that are correlated with a HSGAG lyase activity described herein.\n\n\nAllelic variants of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase include both functional and non-functional proteins. Functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein within a population that maintain one or more HSGAG lyase activity. Functional allelic variants will typically contain only conservative substitution of one or more amino acids of SEQ ID NO:2, or substitution, deletion or insertion of non-critical residues in non-critical regions of the protein. Examples of functional variants include the M17, Q26, Q23 and K169 variants described herein (i.e., SEQ ID NOs: 4, 23, 8 and 10, respectively). Non-functional allelic variants are naturally-occurring amino acid sequence variants of the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein within a population that do not have one or more of the HSGAG lyase activities described herein. Non-functional allelic variants will typically contain a non-conservative substitution, a deletion, or insertion, or premature truncation of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:6, or a substitution, insertion, or deletion in critical residues or critical regions of the protein.\n\n\nMoreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding other \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase family members and, thus, which have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase sequences of SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:5 are intended to be within the scope of the invention.\n\n\nIsolated \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG Lyase Polypeptides In another aspect, the invention features, isolated \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase proteins, and fragments thereof, e.g., biologically active portions thereof. \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein can be isolated from cells or tissue sources using standard protein purification techniques. \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein or fragments thereof can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques or synthesized chemically.\n\n\nPolypeptides of the invention include those which arise as a result of the existence of multiple genes, alternative transcription events, alternative RNA splicing events, and alternative translational and post-translational events. The polypeptide can be expressed in systems, e.g., cultured cells, which result in substantially the same post-translational modifications present when expressed the polypeptide is expressed in a native cell, or in systems which result in the alteration or omission of post-translational modifications, e.g., glycosylation or cleavage, present when expressed in a native cell.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide has one or more of the following characteristics: (1) binds a heparin and/or a heparan sulfate; (2) cleaves one or more glycosidic linkages of a heparin and/or a heparan sulfate; (3) modulates, e.g., increases or reduces, anti-Xa activity and/or anti-IIa activity of a heparin and/or a heparan sulfate; and (4) reduces or eliminates angiogenesis.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase is \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I and the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I can have one or more of the following activities: (1) binds a heparin and/or heparan sulfate; (2) cleaves one or more glycosidic linkages of heparin and/or heparan sulfate, e.g., cleaves one or more glycosidic linkages of sulfated uronic acids, e.g., 2-O and/or 3-O sulfated uronic acids; (3) reduces anti-Xa activity and/or anti-IIa activity of a heparin and/or a heparan sulfate, e.g., as compared to a reference standard, e:g., the anti-Xa activity and/or anti-IIa activity of a commercially available heparin or heparan sulfate or of the heparin or heparan sulfate prior to cleavage. In some embodiments, anti-Xa activity is reduced while anti-IIa activity is maintained or increased. In other embodiments, anti-IIa activity is reduced while anti-Xa activity is maintained or enhanced. In other embodiments, anti-Xa activity and anti-IIa activity are reduced.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase is \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase II and the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase II can have one or more of the following activities: (1) binds a heparin and/or heparan sulfate; (2) cleaves one or more glycosidic linkages of heparin and/or heparan sulfate, e.g., cleaves one or more glycosidic linkages of sulfated and undersulfated uronic acids; (3) increases anti-Xa activity and/or anti-IIa activity of a heparin and/or a heparan sulfate, e.g., as compared to a reference standard, e.g., the anti-Xa activity and/or anti-IIa activity of a commercially available heparin or heparan sulfate or of the heparin or heparan sulfate prior to cleavage. In some embodiments, anti-Xa activity is increased while anti-IIa activity is maintained or reduced. In other embodiments, anti-IIa activity is increased while anti-Xa activity is maintained or reduced. In other embodiments, anti-Xa activity and anti-IIa activity are increased.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein, or fragment thereof, differs from the corresponding sequence in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 23. In one embodiment, it differs by at least one but by less than 15, 10 or 5 amino acid residues. In another, it differs from the corresponding sequence in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 23 by at least one residue but less than 20%, 15%, 10% or 5% of the residues in it differ from the corresponding sequence in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 23. (If this comparison requires alignment the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. “Looped” out sequences from deletions or insertions, or mismatches, are considered differences.) The differences are, preferably, differences or changes at a non essential residue or a conservative substitution.\n\n\nOther embodiments include a protein that contain one or more changes in amino acid sequence, e.g., a change in an amino acid residue which is not essential for activity. Such \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase proteins differ in amino acid sequence from SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 23, yet retain biological activity.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the protein includes an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or more homologous to SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 23.\n\n\nBiologically active portions, in which regions of the protein are deleted, can be prepared by recombinant techniques and evaluated for one or more of the functional activities of a native \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein has an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 23. In other embodiments, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein is substantially identical to SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 23. In yet another embodiment, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein is substantially identical to SEQ ID NOs:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 23 and retains the functional activity of the protein of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 23, as described in detail in the subsections above.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase chimeric or fusion proteins. As used herein, a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase “chimeric protein” or “fusion protein” includes a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide linked to a non-\nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide. A “non-\nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide” refers to a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence corresponding to a protein which is not substantially homologous to the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein, e.g., a protein which is different from the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein and which is derived from the same or a different organism. The \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide of the fusion protein can correspond to all or a portion e.g., a fragment described herein, of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase amino acid sequence. In a preferred embodiment, a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase fusion protein includes at least one (or two) biologically active portion of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein. The non-\nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide can be fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide.\n\n\nThe fusion protein can include a moiety which has a high affinity for a ligand. For example, the fusion protein can be a GST-\nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase fusion protein in which the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase sequences are fused to the C-terminus of the GST sequences. Such fusion proteins can facilitate the purification of recombinant \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase. Alternatively, the fusion protein can be a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein containing a heterologous signal sequence at its N-terminus. In certain host cells (e.g., mammalian host cells), expression and/or secretion of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase can be increased through use of a heterologous signal sequence.\n\n\nMoreover, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase-fusion proteins of the invention can be used as immunogens to produce anti-\nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase antibodies in a subject, to purify \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase ligands and in screening assays to identify molecules which inhibit the interaction of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase substrate.\n\n\nExpression vectors are commercially available that already encode a fusion moiety (e.g., a GST polypeptide). A \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase-encoding nucleic acid can be cloned into such an expression vector such that the fusion moiety is linked in-frame to the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention also features a variant of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, e.g., which functions as an agonist (mimetics). Variants of the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase proteins can be generated by mutagenesis, e.g., discrete point mutation, the insertion or deletion of sequences or the truncation of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein. An agonist of the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase proteins can retain substantially the same, or a subset, of the biological activities of the naturally occurring form of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein.\n\n\nVariants of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein can be identified by screening combinatorial libraries of mutants, e.g., truncation mutants, of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein for agonist activity. Variants of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I include the M17 variant as shown in SEQ ID NO:4 and the Q26 variant as shown in SEQ ID NO:23. Variants of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase II include the Q23 variant as shown in SEQ ID NO:8 and the K169 variant as shown in SEQ ID NO:10.\n\n\nLibraries of fragments e.g., N terminal, C terminal, or internal fragments, of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein coding sequence can be used to generate a variegated population of fragments for screening and subsequent selection of variants of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein. Variants in which a cysteine residues is added or deleted or in which a residue which is glycosylated is added or deleted are particularly preferred.\n\n\nMethods for screening gene products of combinatorial libraries made by point mutations or truncation, and for screening cDNA libraries for gene products having a selected property are known in the art. Such methods are adaptable for rapid screening of the gene libraries generated by combinatorial mutagenesis of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase proteins. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis (REM), a new technique which enhances the frequency of functional mutants in the libraries, can be used in combination with the screening assays to identify \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase variants (Arkin and Yourvan (1992) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n89:7811-7815; Delgrave et al. (1993) \nProtein Engineering \n6:327-331).\n\n\nCell based assays can be exploited to analyze a variegated \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase library. For example, a library of expression vectors can be transfected into a cell line, e.g., a cell line, which ordinarily responds to \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase in a substrate-dependent manner. The transfected cells are then contacted with \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase and the effect of the expression of the mutant on the activity of the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase substrate can be detected, e.g., by measuring cleavage of heparin or heparan sulfate. Plasmid DNA can then be recovered from the cells which score for inhibition, or alternatively, potentiation of signaling by the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase substrate, and the individual clones further characterized.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention features a method of making a fragment or analog of a naturally occurring \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide. The method includes: altering the sequence, e.g., by substitution or deletion of one or more residues, of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide, e.g., altering the sequence of a non-conserved region, or a domain or residue described herein, and testing the altered polypeptide for the desired activity, e.g., as described above.\n\n\nRecombinant Expression Vectors, Host Cells and Genetically Engineered Cells\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention includes, vectors, preferably expression vectors, containing a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide described herein. As used herein, the term “vector” refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked and can include a plasmid, cosmid or viral vector. The vector can be capable of autonomous replication or it can integrate into a host DNA. Viral vectors include, e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses.\n\n\nA vector can include a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase nucleic acid in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell. Preferably the recombinant expression vector includes one or more regulatory sequences operatively linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. The term “regulatory sequence” includes promoters, enhancers and other expression control elements (e.g., polyadenylation signals). Regulatory sequences include those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence, as well as tissue-specific regulatory and/or inducible sequences. The design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression of protein desired, and the like. The expression vectors of the invention can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce proteins or polypeptides, including fusion proteins or polypeptides, encoded by nucleic acids as described herein (e.g., \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase proteins, mutant forms of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase proteins, fusion proteins, and the like).\n\n\nThe recombinant expression vectors of the invention can be designed for expression of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase proteins in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. For example, polypeptides of the invention can be expressed in \nE. coli\n, insect cells (e.g., using baculovirus expression vectors), yeast cells or mammalian cells. Suitable host cells are discussed further in Goeddel, (1990) \nGene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology \n185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. Alternatively, the recombinant expression vector can be transcribed and translated in vitro, for example using T7 promoter regulatory sequences and T7 polymerase.\n\n\nExpression of proteins in prokaryotes is most often carried out in \nE. coli \nwith vectors containing constitutive or inducible promoters directing the expression of either fusion or non-fusion proteins. Fusion vectors add a number of amino acids to a protein encoded therein, usually to the amino terminus of the recombinant protein. Such fusion vectors typically serve three purposes: 1) to increase expression of recombinant protein; 2) to increase the solubility of the recombinant protein; and 3) to aid in the purification of the recombinant protein by acting as a ligand in affinity purification. Often, a proteolytic cleavage site is introduced at the junction of the fusion moiety and the recombinant protein to enable separation of the recombinant protein from the fusion moiety subsequent to purification of the fusion protein. Such enzymes, and their cognate recognition sequences, include Factor Xa, thrombin and enterokinase. Typical fusion expression vectors include pGEX (Pharmacia Biotech Inc; Smith, D. B. and Johnson, K. S. (1988) \nGene \n67:31-40), pMAL (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) and pRIT5 (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.) which fuse glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose E binding protein, or protein A, respectively, to the target recombinant protein.\n\n\nPurified fusion proteins can be used in \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase activity assays, (e.g., direct assays or competitive assays described in detail below), or to generate antibodies specific for \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase proteins. In a preferred embodiment, a fusion protein expressed in a retroviral expression vector of the present invention can be used to infect bone marrow cells which are subsequently transplanted into irradiated recipients. The pathology of the subject recipient is then examined after sufficient time has passed (e.g., six weeks).\n\n\nTo maximize recombinant protein expression in \nE. coli \nis to express the protein in a host bacteria with an impaired capacity to proteolytically cleave the recombinant protein (Gottesman, S., (1990) \nGene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology \n185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. 119-128). Another strategy is to alter the nucleic acid sequence of the nucleic acid to be inserted into an expression vector so that the individual codons for each amino acid are those preferentially utilized in \nE. coli \n(Wada et al., (1992) \nNucleic Acids Res. \n20:2111-2118). Such alteration of nucleic acid sequences of the invention can be carried out by standard DNA synthesis techniques.\n\n\nThe \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase expression vector can be a yeast expression vector, a vector for expression in insect cells, e.g., a baculovirus expression vector or a vector suitable for expression in mammalian cells.\n\n\nWhen used in mammalian cells, the expression vector's control functions can be provided by viral regulatory elements. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma, Adenovirus 2, cytomegalovirus and \nSimian Virus\n 40.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the promoter is an inducible promoter, e.g., a promoter regulated by a steroid hormone, by a polypeptide hormone (e.g., by means of a signal transduction pathway), or by a heterologous polypeptide (e.g., the tetracycline-inducible systems, “Tet-On” and “Tet-Off”; see, e.g., Clontech Inc., CA, Gossen and Bujard (1992) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n89:5547, and Paillard (1989) \nHuman Gene Therapy \n9:983).\n\n\nIn still another embodiment, the recombinant mammalian expression vector is capable of directing expression of the nucleic acid preferentially in a particular cell type (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory elements are used to express the nucleic acid). Non-limiting examples of suitable tissue-specific promoters include the albumin promoter (liver-specific; Pinkert et al. (1-987) \nGenes Dev. \n1:268-277), lymphoid-specific promoters (Calame and Eaton (1988) \nAdv. Immunol. \n43:235-275), in particular promoters of T cell receptors (Winoto and Baltimore (1989) \nEMBO J. \n8:729-733) and immunoglobulins (Banerji et al. (1983) \nCell \n33:729-740; Queen and Baltimore (1983) \nCell \n33:741-748), neuron-specific promoters (e.g., the neurofilament promoter; Byrne and Ruddle (1989) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n86:5473-5477), pancreas-specific promoters (Edlund et al. (1985) \nScience \n230:912-916), and mammary gland-specific promoters (e.g., milk whey promoter; U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,316 and European Application Publication No. 264,166). Developmentally-regulated promoters are also encompassed, for example, the murine hox promoters (Kessel and Gruss (1990) \nScience \n249:374-379) and the α-fetoprotein promoter (Campes and Tilghman (1989) \nGenes Dev. \n3:537-546).\n\n\nThe invention further provides a recombinant expression vector comprising a DNA molecule of the invention cloned into the expression vector in an antisense orientation. Regulatory sequences (e.g., viral promoters and/or enhancers) operatively linked to a nucleic acid cloned in the antisense orientation can be chosen which direct the constitutive, tissue specific or cell type specific expression of antisense RNA in a variety of cell types. The antisense expression vector can be in the form of a recombinant plasmid, phagemid or attenuated virus.\n\n\nAnother aspect the invention provides a host cell which includes a nucleic acid molecule described herein, e.g., a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase nucleic acid molecule within a recombinant expression vector or a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase nucleic acid molecule containing sequences which allow it to homologously recombine into a specific site of the host cell's genome. The terms “host cell” and “recombinant host cell” are used interchangeably herein. Such terms refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term as used herein.\n\n\nA host cell can be any prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell. For example, a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein can be expressed in bacterial cells (such as \nE. coli\n), insect cells, yeast or mammalian cells (such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) or COS cells). Other suitable host cells are known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nVector DNA can be introduced into host cells via conventional transformation or transfection techniques. As used herein, the terms “transformation” and “transfection” are intended to refer to a variety of art-recognized techniques for introducing foreign nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) into a host cell, including calcium phosphate or calcium chloride co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, lipofection, or electroporation.\n\n\nA host cell of the invention can be used to produce (i.e., express) a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein. Accordingly, the invention further provides methods for producing a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein using the host cells of the invention. In one embodiment, the method includes culturing the host cell of the invention (into which a recombinant expression vector encoding a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein has been introduced) in a suitable medium such that a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein is produced. In another embodiment, the method further includes isolating a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase protein from the medium or the host cell.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention features, a cell or purified preparation of cells which include a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase transgene, or which otherwise misexpress \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase. The cell preparation can consist of human or non-human cells, e.g., rodent cells, e.g., mouse or rat cells, rabbit cells, or pig cells. In preferred embodiments, the cell or cells include a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase transgene, e.g., a heterologous form of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase, e.g., a gene derived from humans (in the case of a non-human cell). The \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase transgene can be misexpressed, e.g., overexpressed or underexpressed. In other preferred embodiments, the cell or cells include a gene that mis-expresses an endogenous \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase, e.g., a gene the expression of which is disrupted, e.g., a knockout. Such cells can serve as a model for studying disorders that are related to mutated or mis-expressed \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase alleles or for use in drug screening.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention features, a human cell, e.g., a hematopoietic stem cell, transformed with nucleic acid which encodes a subject \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase polypeptide.\n\n\nAlso provided are cells in which a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase is under the control of a regulatory sequence that does not normally control the expression of the endogenous \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase gene. The expression characteristics of an endogenous gene within a cell, e.g., a cell line or microorganism, can be modified by inserting a heterologous DNA regulatory element into the genome of the cell such that the inserted regulatory element is operably linked to the endogenous \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase gene. For example, an endogenous \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase gene which is “transcriptionally silent,” e.g., not normally expressed, or expressed only at very low levels, may be activated by inserting a regulatory element which is capable of promoting the expression of a normally expressed gene product in that cell. Techniques such as targeted homologous recombinations, can be used to insert the heterologous DNA as described in, e.g., Chappel, U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,071; WO 91/06667, published in May 16, 1991.\n\n\nUses\n\n\nAs described herein, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules of the invention are useful in many applications including, but not limited to: 1) characterization of GAGs such as heparins and heparan sulfates in terms of chemical composition (di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, octa-, and/or deca-oligosaccharides); 2) characterization of a pharmaceutical formulation of GAGs such as a formulation of heparin or a heparan sulfate; 3) fractionation of a GAG such as a heparin and a heparan sulfate into both its chemical constituents as well as into smaller fragments of defined length, sequence, and potential bioactivities; 4) in vitro neutralization of the anticoagulant activity (anti-Xa) of a heparin or a heparan sulfate; 5) identification of the presence and purity of a particular GAG such as a heparin or a heparan sulfate in a sample; 6) determination of the composition of a GAG in a sample; 7) determination of the sequence of di-, tetra-, hexa-, octa- and deca-saccharide units in a particular heparin or heparan sulfate; 8) use as an additional analytic tool for chemical analysis using techniques such as mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, HPLC, and ion-pair HPLC; 9) for cleaving a particular GAG such as a heparin or heparan sulfate that comprises at least two disaccharide units; 10) for inhibiting angiogenesis, e.g., through administration to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a composition (e.g., a pharmaceutical composition) containing \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules; 11) for treating cancer through the administration to a subject a composition (e.g., a pharmaceutical composition) containing \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules; 12) inhibiting cellular proliferation through the administration to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a composition (e.g., a pharmaceutical composition) containing \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules for inhibiting cellular proliferation; 13) for ex vivo neutralization of the anti-Xa activity of a preparation (e.g., a pharmaceutical preparation) of a heparin or a heparan sulfate previously administered to a subject for the inhibition of coagulation; 14) for in vivo neutralization of the anti-Xa activity of preparation (e.g., a pharmaceutical preparation) of a heparin or a heparan sulfate through administration to a subject in need of such neutralization (e.g., a subject to whom a pharmaceutical preparation of a heparin or a heparan sulfate had previously been administered); 15) for ex vivo neutralization of the anti-IIa activity of a preparation (e.g., pharmaceutical preparation) of a heparin or heparan sulfate previously administered to a subject for the inhibition of thrombosis; or 16) for in vivo neutralization of the anti-IIa activity of preparation (e.g., a pharmaceutical preparation) of a heparin or a heparan sulfate through administration to a subject in need in need of such neutralization (e.g., a subject to whom a pharmaceutical preparation of a heparin or heparan sulfate had previously been administered).\n\n\nCharacterization and Sequencing of GAGs\n\n\nMethods described herein can be used, e.g., for analyzing polysaccharides such as GAGs, (e.g., a mixed population of polysaccharides), e.g., to define the structural signature and/or activity of a polysaccharides (e.g., a mixed population of polysaccharides), by contacting the polysaccharide with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecule. A structural signature, as used herein, refers to information regarding, e.g., the identity and number the mono- and di-saccharide building blocks of a polysaccharide, information regarding the physiochemical properties such as the overall charge (also referred to as the “net charge” or “total charge”), charge density, molecular size, charge to mass ratio and the presence of iduronic and/or glucuronic acid content as well as the relationships between the mono- and di-saccharide building blocks, and active sites associated with these building blocks, inter alia. The structural signature can be provided by determining one or more primary outputs that include the following: the presence or the amount of one or more component saccharides or disaccharides; as used herein, “component saccharides” refers to the saccharides that make up the polysaccharide. Component saccharides can include monosaccharides, disaccharides, trisaccharides, etc., and can also include sugars normally found in nature as well as non-natural and modified sugars, e.g., that result due to production, processing and/or purification; the presence or the amount of one or more block components, wherein a “block component” is made up of more than one saccharide or polysaccharide; and the presence or amount of one or more modified saccharides, wherein a modified saccharide is one present in a starting material used to make a preparation but which is altered in the production of the preparation, e.g., a saccharide modified by cleavage. “Sequence” with respect to polysaccharides refers to the linear arrangement of covalently linked component saccharides, and can be determined by methods known in the art, e.g., the methods disclosed herein and in PCT Publication Nos: WO 00/65521, WO 02/23190, and WO 04/055491; U.S. Publication Nos: 20030191587 and 20040197933; Venkataraman (1999); Shriver et al. (2000a); Shriver et al. (2000b); and Keiser et al. (2001); the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. “Positioning of the active site” refers to a correlation between a certain component polysaccharide and a given activity.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the invention provides, methods of evaluating a polysaccharide mixture, e.g., a heterogeneous population of HLGAGs, by evaluating one or more parameters related to a structural signature species described herein. Such parameters can include the presence, size distribution, or quantity of a structural signature disclosed herein. The structural signature can be one or more of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the structural signature is determined by one or more methods chosen from the group consisting of MALDI-MS, ESI-MS, CE, HPLC, FPLC, fluorometry, ELISA, chromogenic assays such as reverse phase column chromatography (e.g., HPLC), colorimetric assays, NMR and other spectroscopic techniques.\n\n\nThe polysaccharide composition is digested, incompletely or completely digested, with one or more \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecule. The composition can further be digested with one or more HLGAG degrading enzyme. Examples of other HLGAG degrading enzymes include: heparinase I, heparinase II, heparinase III, heparinase IV, heparanase, D-glucuronidase, L-iduronidase and functionally active variants and fragments thereof. Various HLGAG degrading enzymes, and variants and fragments thereof, are known and described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos: 5,569,600; 5,389,539; 5,830,726; 5,714,376; 5,919,693; 5,681,733 and 6,869,789; and U.S. Patent Publications Nos: 20030099628; 20030303301; and 20010565375, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe methods described herein can further include: providing or determining a first structural signature by contacting a batch of a polysaccharide (e.g., a heterogenous population of polysaccharides) with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecule or molecules; providing or determining a second structural signature of a different batch of a polysaccharide (e.g., a heterogenous population of polysaccharides) by contacting the batch with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecule or molecules; and comparing the first and second structural determinations to determine if one or more of the batches has a structural determination associated with a particular property. The methods can further include selecting or discarding a batch of the polysaccharide depending on its structural determination.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, a batch of a polysaccharide (e.g., a heterogenous population of polysaccharides) can be analyzed by comparing one or more structural signature of the polysaccharide obtained by contacting the polysaccharide with one or more \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules to a reference standard. The reference standard can be, e.g., a preselected range or level and/or the absence or presence of a structural signature present in a mixed population of polysaccharides, e.g., a commercially available population of polysaccharides such as enoxaparin (Lovenox™); dalteparin (Fragmin™); certoparin (Sandobarin™); ardeparin (Normiflo™); nadroparin (Fraxiparin™); parnaparin (Fluxum™); reviparin (Clivarin™); tinzaparin (Innohep™ or Logiparin™), or Fondaparinux (Arixtra™), that has been digested with the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecule or molecules.\n\n\nThe \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules can also be used to determine a reference standard for a drug by analyzing a composition contacted with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecule or molecules and determining the bioequivalence and/or bioavailability of one or more of the components in the mixture. As used herein, “bioequivalence” means “the absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent to which an active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the same molar dose under similar conditions.”\n\n\nProduction of Fractionated HLGAG Preparations\n\n\nThe \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules described herein can be used to produce polysaccharides (e.g., fractionated heparin or heparan sulfate), e.g., having desired properties, e.g., desired activities and/or reduced undesired properties, e.g., undesired side effects. As used herein, “desired activities” refers to those activities that are beneficial for a given indication, e.g., a positive patient reaction as defined herein, inter alia. An “undesirable activity” may include those activities that are not beneficial for a given indication, e.g., a negative patient reaction, as defined herein, inter alia. A given activity may be a desired activity for one indication, and an undesired activity for another, such as anti-IIa activity, which while undesirable for certain indications, is desirable in others, notably acute or trauma situations. Thus, the invention relates to methods for designing heparins, LMWHs or synthetic heparins with ideal product profiles including, but not limited to such features as high activity, e.g., high anti-Xa and/or anti-IIa activity, reduced activity, e.g., reduced anti-Xa and/or anti-IIa activity, well characterized, neutralizable, lower side effects including reduced HIT, attractive pharmacokinetics, and/or reduced PF4 binding.\n\n\nFractionated heparins can be designed, e.g., by contacting composition that includes a mixed population of polysaccharides, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), HLGAGs, UFH, FH, LMWHs, or synthetic heparins including but not limited to enoxaparin (Lovenox™); dalteparin (Fragmin™); certoparin (Sandobarin™); ardeparin (Normiflo™); nadroparin (Fraxiparin™); parnaparin (Fluxum™); reviparin (Clivarin™); tinzaparin (Innohep™ or Logiparin™), or Fondaparinux (Arixtra™) with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, a fractionated heparin preparation having reduced anti-Xa and/or anti-IIa activity is prepared by contacting a heparin with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I molecule. In some embodiments, anti-Xa activity is reduced while anti-IIa activity is maintained or increased. In other embodiments, anti-IIa activity is reduced while anti-Xa activity is maintained or enhanced. In other embodiments, anti-Xa activity and anti-IIa activity are reduced. Heparins having reduced anti-Xa and/or anti-IIa activity can be used, e.g., as a carrier to deliver an agent, e.g., a diagnostic, prophylactic or therapeutic agent. The heparin molecule can be linked to the agent. Active agents can include a therapeutic or prophylactic polypeptide, nucleic acid, small molecule, lipid/glycolipids, etc. In one embodiment, the active agent is a therapeutic polypeptide selected from the group consisting of insulin, proinsulin, human growth hormone, interferon, α-1 proteinase inhibitor, alkaline phosphotase, angiogenin, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, extracellular superoxide dismutase, fibrinogen, glucocerebrosidase, glutamate decarboxylase, human serum albumin, myelin basic protein, soluble CD4, lactoferrin, lactoglobulin, lysozyme, lactoalbumin, erythropoietin, tissue plasminogen activator, antithrombin III, prolactin, and α1-antitrypsin. The therapeutic or prophylactic polypeptide can be an active derivative or fragment of such polypeptides. The active agent can also be, but is not limited to one or more of: parathyroid hormone and derivatives and fragments thereof, erythropoietin, epoetin beta, gene activated erythropoietin, second generation EPO, novel erythropoiesis stimulating protein, insulin lispro, insulin (bovine), insulin, insulin aspart, insulin analogue, Calcitonin, Theraccine, becaplermin (recombinant human platelet derived growth factor-BB), trafermin, human growth hormone-releasing factor, BMP-7, PEG aspariginase, domase alpha, alglucerase, agalsidase-beta, dornase alpha, agalsidase-alfa, streptokinase, teneteplase, reteplase, alteplase, pamiteplase, Rh factor VIII, Rh FVIIa, Factor IX (Human), Factor IX (complex), HGH, Somatrem/somatropin, anti-CD33-calicheamicin conjugate, Edrecolomab, rituxumab, daclizumab, trastuzumab, sulesomab, abciximab, infliximab, muromonab-CD3, palivizumab, alemtuzumab, basiliximab, oprelvekin, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, ibritumomab tiuxetan, sulesomab, palivizumab, interleukin-2, celmoleukin (rIL-2), interferon alfacon-1, interferon alpha, interferon alpha+ribavirin, peg interferon alpha-2a, interferon alpha-2b, interferon alpha 3n, interferon beta-1a, interferon beta, interferon beta 1b, interferon gamma, interferon gamma-1b, filgrastim, sargramostim, lenograstim, molgramostim, mirimostim, nartograstim, oprelvekin, peptide tyrosin-tyrosin (PYY), apolipoprotein A-IV, leptin, melanocortin, amylin, orexin, adiponectin, and ghrelin. In one embodiment, the active agent is an active polypeptide, e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic polypeptide, and the polypeptide has a molecular weight of less than 150 kDa, more preferably less than 100 kDa, and more preferably less than 50 kDa. In one embodiment, the active agent is an active polypeptide, e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic polypeptide, and the polypeptide has a molecular weight of about 500 Da-5 kDa, 5 to 10 kDa, 10 to 30 kDa, 18 to 35 kDa, 30 to 50 kDa, 50 to 100 kDa, 100 to 150 kDa. In one embodiment, the active polypeptide is insulin or an active fragments or derivatives thereof. In another embodiment, the active polypeptide is human growth hormone or an active fragment or derivative thereof. In yet another embodiment, the active polypeptide is interferon. In other embodiments, the heparin molecule is linked to an inactive agent. Examples of inactive agents include biological probes or contrast agents for imaging. In another embodiment, the active agent can be a small molecule drug, e.g., a small molecule drug currently available for therapeutic, diagnostic, or prophylactic use, or a drug in development. In some embodiments, the active agent is linked to one or more heparin molecules in the formulation. As an example, small molecule drugs, and protein-based drugs may be linked to heparin molecule for delivery via known chemistries such as EDC, CNBH\n4\n/DMSO/Acetic Acid, etc.\n\n\nThe invention also relates to fractionated heparin preparations having increased anti-Xa and/or anti-IIa activity prepared by contacting a heparin with a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase II molecule. Such preparation can be used, e.g., to treat or prevent a disease associated with coagulation, such as thrombosis, cardiovascular disease, vascular conditions or atrial fibrillation; migraine, atherosclerosis; an inflammatory disorder, such as autoimmune disease or atopic disorders; obesity or excess adipose, an allergy; a respiratory disorder, such as asthma, emphysema, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cystic fibrosis, or lung reperfusion injury; a cancer or metastatic disorder, e.g., lipomas; diabetes; an angiogenic disorder, such as neovascular disorders of the eye, osteoporosis, psoriasis, arthritis, Alzheimer's, a subject to undergo, undergoing or having undergone surgical procedure, organ transplant, orthopedic surgery, treatment for a fracture, e.g., a hip fracture, hip replacement, knee replacement, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), stent placement, angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nThe \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules, as well as heparin molecules prepared by cleavage with the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions typically include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.\n\n\nA pharmaceutical composition is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.\n\n\nAlternatively, the pharmaceutical composition can be used to treat a sample (e.g., blood in a bioreactor, e.g., to deheparinize blood) before the sample is introduced into a subject.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL™ (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\nSterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.\n\n\nOral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.\n\n\nFor administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer.\n\n\nSystemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art.\n\n\nThe compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811.\n\n\nIt is advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.\n\n\nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.\n\n\nThe data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.\n\n\nThe skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage and timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration.\n\n\nTherapeutic Applications\n\n\nThe \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules can act as novel diagnostic and therapeutic agents for controlling one or more of cellular proliferative and/or differentiative disorders, e.g., by preventing or inhibiting angiogenesis of cells otherwise exhibiting or otherwise associated with unwanted proliferation and/or differentiation. Examples of cellular and/or differentiative disorders include: diabetes; arthritis, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis; ocular disorders, e.g., ocular neovascularization, diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, retinal fibroplasias, uevitis, eye disorders associated with iris neovasculatization; and cancer, e.g., carcinoma, sarcoma, metastatic disorders or hematopoietic neoplastic disorders, e.g., leukemias.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms “cancer”, “hyperproliferative” and “neoplastic” refer to cells having the capacity for autonomous growth. Examples of such cells include cells having an abnormal state or condition characterized by rapidly proliferating cell growth. Hyperproliferative and neoplastic disease states may be categorized as pathologic, i.e., characterizing or constituting a disease state, or may be categorized as non-pathologic, i.e., a deviation from normal but not associated with a disease state. The term is meant to include all types of cancerous growths or oncogenic processes, metastatic tissues or malignantly transformed cells, tissues, or organs, irrespective of histopathologic type or stage of invasiveness. “Pathologic hyperproliferative” cells occur in disease states characterized by malignant tumor growth. Examples of non-pathologic hyperproliferative cells include proliferation of cells associated with wound repair.\n\n\nThe terms “cancer” or “neoplasms” include malignancies of the various organ systems, such as affecting lung, breast, thyroid, lymphoid, gastrointestinal, and genito-urinary tract, as well as adenocarcinomas which include malignancies such as most colon cancers, renal-cell carcinoma, prostate cancer and/or testicular tumors, non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the small intestine and cancer of the esophagus.\n\n\nThe term “carcinoma” is art recognized and refers to malignancies of epithelial or endocrine tissues including respiratory system carcinomas, gastrointestinal system carcinomas, genitourinary system carcinomas, testicular carcinomas, breast carcinomas, prostatic carcinomas, endocrine system carcinomas, and melanomas. Exemplary carcinomas include those forming from tissue of the cervix, lung, prostate, breast, head and neck, colon and ovary. The term also includes carcinosarcomas, e.g., which include malignant tumors composed of carcinomatous and sarcomatous tissues. An “adenocarcinoma” refers to a carcinoma derived from glandular tissue or in which the tumor cells form recognizable glandular structures.\n\n\nThe term “sarcoma” is art recognized and refers to malignant tumors of mesenchymal derivation.\n\n\nAdditional examples of proliferative disorders include hematopoietic neoplastic disorders. As used herein, the term “hematopoietic neoplastic disorders” includes diseases involving hyperplastic/neoplastic cells of hematopoietic origin. A hematopoietic neoplastic disorder can arise from myeloid, lymphoid or erythroid lineages, or precursor cells thereof. Preferably, the diseases arise from poorly differentiated acute leukemias, e.g., erythroblastic leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Additional exemplary myeloid disorders include, but are not limited to, acute promyeloid leukemia (APML), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (reviewed in Vaickus, L. (1991) \nCrit Rev. in Oncol./Hemotol. \n11:267-97); lymphoid malignancies include, but are not limited to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) which includes B-lineage ALL and T-lineage ALL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), hairy cell leukemia (HLL) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). Additional forms of malignant lymphomas include, but are not limited to non-Hodgkin lymphoma and variants thereof, peripheral T cell lymphomas, adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGF), Hodgkin's disease and Reed-Sternberg disease.\n\n\nThe data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED\n50 \nwith little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC\n50 \n(i.e., the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma can be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules, e.g., the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I molecules, can act as prophylactic or therapeutic agents for controling heparin-associated disorders. Examples of such disorders include, but are not limited to, heparin-induced anticoagulation and/or angiogenesis. Thus, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules, e.g., the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I molecules, can be used to reduce or eliminate (e.g., neutralize) one or more anticoagulation and/or antithrombotic properties of heparin and/or heparan sulfate, e.g., during or after surgery. In other embodiments, the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules, e.g., the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I molecules, can be used to deheparinized blood, e.g., in a bioreactor, e.g., a bioreactor used in heart-lung and/or kidney dialysis.\n\n\nThe \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase molecules described herein can also be used to design fractionated HLGAG preparations, e.g., heparin and/or heparan sulfate preparations. Such fractionated HLGAG preparations may have many therapeutic utilities. For instance, it is known that HLGAG compositions are useful for preventing and treating dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, coagulation, angiogenesis, thrombotic disorders, cardiovascular disease, vascular conditions, atherosclerosis, respiratory disorders, circulatory shock and related disorders, as well as inhibiting cancer cell growth and metastasis. Each of these disorders is well-known in the art and is described, for instance, in \nHarrison's Principles of Internal Medicine \n(McGraw Hill, Inc., New York), which is incorporated by reference. The use of HLGAG compositions in various therapeutic methods is described and summarized in Huang, J. and Shimamura, A., Coagulation Disorders, 12, 1251-1281 (1998).\n\n\nThe fractionated HLGAG preparations can be used, e.g., to treat or prevent a disorder where increased presence of active FGF, e.g., aFGF and/or bFGF, is desirable.\n\n\nThe HLGAG preparations are useful for treating or preventing disorders associated with coagulation. When an imbalance in the coagulation pathway shifts towards excessive coagulation, the result is the development of thrombotic tendencies, which are often manifested as heart attacks, strokes, deep venous thrombosis, acute coronary syndromes (ACS) such as unstable angina, and myocardial infarcts. A “disease associated with coagulation” as used herein refers to a condition characterized by local inflammation which can result from an interruption or reduction in the blood supply to a tissue which may occur, for instance, as a result of blockage of a blood vessel responsible for supplying blood to the tissue such as is seen for myocardial or cerebral infarction or peripheral vascular disease, or as a result of emboli formation associated with conditions such as atrial fibrillation or deep venous thrombosis. Coagulation disorders include, but are not limited to, cardiovascular disease and vascular conditions such as cerebral ischemia. It is particularly useful to treat disorders such as myocardial infarction and ACS with, e.g., a polysaccharide by pulmonary delivery because of the fast absorption and action of this delivery system.\n\n\nThe fractionated HLGAG preparations are useful for treating cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular diseases include, but are not limited to, acute myocardial infarction, ACS, e.g., unstable angina, and atrial fibrillation. Myocardial infarction is a disease state which sometimes occurs with an abrupt decrease in coronary blood flow that follows a thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery previously narrowed by atherosclerosis. Such injury may be produced or facilitated by factors such as cigarette smoking, hypertension, and lipid accumulation. Acute angina is due to transient myocardial ischemia. This disorder is usually associated with a heaviness, pressure, squeezing, smothering, or choking feeling below the sternum. Episodes are usually caused by exertion or emotion, but can occur at rest.\n\n\nAtrial fibrillation is a common form of arrhythmia generally arising as a result of emotional stress or following surgery, exercise, or acute alcoholic intoxication. Persistent forms of atrial fibrillation generally occur in patients with cardiovascular disease. Atrial fibrillation is characterized by disorganized atrial activity without discrete P waves on the surface ECG. This disorganized activity can lead to improper blood flow in the atrium and thrombus formation. These thrombi can embolize, resulting in cerebral ischemia and other disorders.\n\n\nPersons undergoing surgery, anesthesia and extended periods of bed rest or other inactivity are often susceptible to a condition known as deep venous thrombosis, or DVT, which is a clotting of venous blood in the lower extremities and/or pelvis. This clotting occurs due to the absence of muscular activity in the lower extremities required to pump the venous blood (stasis), local vascular injury or a hypercoaguble state. The condition can be life-threatening if a blood clot migrates to the lung, resulting in a “pulmonary embolus” or otherwise interferes with cardiovascular circulation. One method of treatment involves administration of an anti-coagulant.\n\n\nThe fractionated HLGAG preparations can be used for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for reducing the risk of a cardiovascular disease or for treating the cardiovascular disease. Other therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-thrombotic agents, anti-platelet agents, fibrinolytic agents, lipid reducing agents, direct thrombin inhibitors, anti-Xa inhibitors, anti-IIa inhibitors, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors such as hirudin, hirugen, Angiomax, agatroban, PPACK, thrombin aptamers.\n\n\nThe HLGAG preparations are also useful for treating vascular conditions. Vascular conditions include, but are not limited to, disorders such as deep venous thrombosis, peripheral vascular disease, cerebral ischemia, including stroke, and pulmonary embolism. A cerebral ischemic attack or cerebral ischemia is a form of ischemic condition in which the blood supply to the brain is blocked. This interruption or reduction in the blood supply to the brain may result from a variety of causes, including an intrinsic blockage or occlusion of the blood vessel itself, a remotely originated source of occlusion, decreased perfusion pressure or increased blood viscosity resulting in inadequate cerebral blood flow, or a ruptured blood vessel in the subarachnoid space or intracerebral tissue.\n\n\nThe HLGAG preparations are useful for treating cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia may result in either transient or permanent deficits and the seriousness of the neurological damage in a patient who has experienced cerebral ischemia depends on the intensity and duration of the ischemic event. A transient ischemic attack is one in which the blood flow to the brain is interrupted only briefly and causes temporary neurological deficits, which often are clear in less than 24 hours. Symptoms of TIA include numbness or weakness of face or limbs, loss of the ability to speak clearly and/or to understand the speech of others, a loss of vision or dimness of vision, and a feeling of dizziness. Permanent cerebral ischemic attacks, also called stroke, are caused by a longer interruption or reduction in blood flow to the brain resulting from either a thrombus or embolism. A stroke causes a loss of neurons typically resulting in a neurologic deficit that may improve but that does not entirely resolve.\n\n\nThromboembolic stroke is due to the occlusion of an extracranial or intracranial blood vessel by a thrombus or embolus. Because it is often difficult to discern whether a stroke is caused by a thrombosis or an embolism, the term “thromboembolism” is used to cover strokes caused by either of these mechanisms.\n\n\nThe rapid absorption of HLGAGs, such as UFH or LMWH, after inhalation can be very valuable in the treatment of venous thromboembolism. Intravenous administration of UFH has been used widely for treatment of venous thromboembolism in combination with oral warfarin. Due to the improved efficacy and reduced risks, however, LMWHs have been increasingly used as an alternative to intravenous UFH in treatment of venous thromboembolism. It has been established that efficacy of heparin therapy depends on achieving critical therapeutic levels (e.g., of values of anti-factor Xa or anti-factor IIa activity) within the first 24 hours of treatment. Intrapulmonary delivery of heparin particles to achieve rapid therapeutic levels of heparin in the early stage of thromboembolism, could also be combined with other routes of administration of LMWHs or heparin for prolonged antithrombotic/anticoagulant effect such as oral administration.\n\n\nThe HLGAG preparations can also be used to treat acute thromboembolic stroke. An acute stroke is a medical syndrome involving neurological injury resulting from an ischemic event, which is an interruption or reduction in the blood supply to the brain.\n\n\nAn effective amount of a HLGAG preparation alone or in combination with another therapeutic for the treatment of stroke is that amount sufficient to reduce in vivo brain injury resulting from the stroke. A reduction of brain injury is any prevention of injury to the brain which otherwise would have occurred in a subject experiencing a thromboembolic stroke absent the treatment described herein. Several physiological parameters may be used to assess reduction of brain injury, including smaller infarct size, improved regional cerebral blood flow, and decreased intracranial pressure, for example, as compared to pretreatment patient parameters, untreated stroke patients or stroke patients treated with thrombolytic agents alone.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical HLGAG preparation may be used alone or in combination with a therapeutic agent for treating a disease associated with coagulation. Examples of therapeutics useful in the treatment of diseases associated with coagulation include anticoagulation agents, antiplatelet agents, and thrombolytic agents.\n\n\nAnticoagulation agents prevent the coagulation of blood components and thus prevent clot formation. Anticoagulants include, but are not limited to, warfarin, Coumadin, dicumarol, phenprocoumon, acenocoumarol, ethyl biscoumacetate, and indandione derivatives. “Direct thrombin inhibitors” include hirudin, hirugen, Angiomax, agatroban, PPACK, thrombin aptamers. Antiplatelet agents inhibit platelet aggregation and are often used to prevent thromboembolic stroke in patients who have experienced a transient ischemic attack or stroke. Thrombolytic agents lyse clots which cause the thromboembolic stroke. Thrombolytic agents have been used in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism and pulmonary emboli and are well known in the art (e.g. see Hennekens et al, \nJ Am Coll Cardiol\n; v. 25 (7 supp), p. 18S-22S (1995); Holmes, et al, \nJ Am Coll Cardiol\n; v.25 (7 suppl), p. 10S-17S(1995)).\n\n\nPulmonary embolism as used herein refers to a disorder associated with the entrapment of a blood clot in the lumen of a pulmonary artery, causing severe respiratory dysfunction. Pulmonary emboli often originate in the veins of the lower extremities where clots form in the deep leg veins and then travel to lungs via the venous circulation. Thus, pulmonary embolism often arises as a complication of deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity veins. Symptoms of pulmonary embolism include acute onset of shortness of breath, chest pain (worse with breathing), and rapid heart rate and respiratory rate. Some individuals may experience haemoptysis.\n\n\nThe HLGAG preparations and methods are also useful for treating or preventing atherosclerosis. Heparin has been shown to be beneficial in prevention of atherosclerosis in various experimental models. Due to the more direct access to the endothelium of the vascular system, inhaled heparin can be useful in prevention of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is one form of arteriosclerosis that is believed to be the cause of most coronary artery disease, aortic aneurysm and atrial disease of the lower extremities, as well as contributing to cerebrovascular disease.\n\n\nDue to its fast absorption and variable elimination rate, HLGAG with or without excipients can be used as an alternative for the intravenous heparin for surgical and dialysis procedures. For example, HLGAG particles can be inhaled prior to surgery by volunteer inhalation or passively inhaled via trachea tube during the anesthesia prior to or during the surgery. Surgical patients, especially those over the age of 40 years have an increased risk of developing deep venous thrombosis. Thus, the use of HLGAG particles for preventing the development of thrombosis associated with surgical procedures is contemplated. In addition to general surgical procedures such as percutaneous intervention (e.g., percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)), PCTA, stents and other similar approaches, hip or knee replacement, cardiac-pulmonary by-pass surgery, coronary revascularization surgery, orthopedic surgery, and prosthesis replacement surgery, the methods are also useful in subjects undergoing a tissue or organ transplantation procedure or treatment for fractures such as hip fractures.\n\n\nIn addition, pulmonary inhalation of heparin is valuable in treatment of respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, allergy, emphysema, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung reperfusion injury, and ischemia-reperfusion injury of the lung, kidney, heart, and gut, and lung tumor growth and metastasis.\n\n\nCystic fibrosis is a chronic progressive disease affecting the respiratory system. One serious consequence of cystic fibrosis is \nPseudomonas aeruginosa \nlung infection, which by itself accounts for almost 90% of the morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis. Therapeutics for treating cystic fibrosis include antimicrobials for treating the pathogenic infection.\n\n\nHeparin is also a well established inhibitor of elastase and tumor growth and metastasis. The aerosolized heparin particles are capable of inhibiting elastase induced lung injury in an acute lung emphysema model. Asthma is a disorder of the respiratory system characterized by inflammation, narrowing of the airways and increased reactivity of the airways to inhaled agents. Asthma is frequently, although not exclusively, associated with atopic or allergic symptoms. Asthma may also include exercise induced asthma, bronchoconstrictive response to bronchostimulants, delayed-type hypersensitivity, auto immune encephalomyelitis and related disorders. Allergies are generally caused by IgE antibody generation against allergens. Emphysema is a distention of the air spaces distal to the terminal bronchiole with destruction of alveolar septa. Emphysema arises out of elastase induced lung injury. Heparin is capable of inhibiting this elastase induced injury. Adult respiratory distress syndrome is a term which encompasses many acute defuse infiltrative lung lesions of diverse ideologies which are accompanied by severe atrial hypoxemia. One of the most frequent causes of ARDS is sepsis. Inflammatory diseases include but are not limited to autoimmune diseases and atopic disorders. Other types of inflammatory diseases which are treatable with HLGAGs are refractory ulcerative colitis, Chrohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune disease, non-specific ulcerative colitis and interstitial cystitis.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the HLGAG preparations are used for inhibiting angiogenesis. An effective amount for inhibiting angiogenesis of the HLGAG preparation is administered to a subject in need of treatment thereof. Angiogenesis as used herein is the inappropriate formation of new blood vessels. “Angiogenesis” often occurs in tumors when endothelial cells secrete a group of growth factors that are mitogenic for endothelium causing the elongation and proliferation of endothelial cells which results in the generation of new blood vessels. Several of the angiogenic mitogens are heparin binding peptides which are related to endothelial cell growth factors. The inhibition of angiogenesis can cause tumor regression in animal models, suggesting a use as a therapeutic anticancer agent. An effective amount for inhibiting angiogenesis is an amount of HLGAG preparation which is sufficient to diminish the number of blood vessels growing into a tumor. This amount can be assessed in an animal model of tumors and angiogenesis, many of which are known in the art. Angiogenic disorders include, but are not limited to, neovascular disorders of the eye, osteoporosis, psoriasis, arthritis, cancer and cardiovascular disorders.\n\n\nThe HLGAG preparations are also useful for inhibiting neovascularization associated with eye disease. In another embodiment, the HLGAG preparation is administered to treat psoriasis. Psoriasis is a common dermatologic disease caused by chronic inflammation.\n\n\nHLGAG containing compositions, may also inhibit cancer cell growth and metastasis. Thus the methods are useful for treating and/or preventing tumor cell proliferation or metastasis in a subject. The cancer may be a malignant or non-malignant cancer. Cancers or tumors include but are not limited to biliary tract cancer; brain cancer; breast cancer; cervical cancer; choriocarcinoma; colon cancer; endometrial cancer; esophageal cancer; gastric cancer; intraepithelial neoplasms; leukemias, lymphomas; liver cancer; lung cancer (e.g. small cell and non-small cell); melanoma; neuroblastomas; oral cancer; ovarian cancer; pancreatic cancer; prostate cancer; rectal cancer; sarcomas; skin cancer; testicular cancer; thyroid cancer; and renal cancer, as well as other carcinomas and sarcomas.\n\n\nA subject in need of cancer treatment may be a subject who has a high probability of developing cancer. These subjects include, for instance, subjects having a genetic abnormality, the presence of which has been demonstrated to have a correlative relation to a higher likelihood of developing a cancer and subjects exposed to cancer-causing agents such as tobacco, asbestos, or other chemical toxins, or a subject who has previously been treated for cancer and is in apparent remission.\n\n\nOTHER EMBODIMENTS\n\n\nThis invention is further illustrated by the following examples that should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all references, patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nCloning and Recombinant Expression of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG Lyase I\n\n\nThe \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I sequence (\nFIG. 1\n; SEQ ID NO:1), which is approximately 1130 nucleotides long contains a predicted methionine-initiated coding sequence of about 1128 nucleotides, including the termination codon (SEQ ID NO:1 in \nFIG. 1A\n). The coding sequence encodes a 376 amino acid protein (SEQ ID NO:2 in \nFIG. 1B\n).\n\n\nThe \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase sequence is structurally similar to the \nF. heparinum \nheparinase I sequence. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of the two lyases is shown in \nFIG. 2\n.\n\n\nThe \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase gene was cloned by PCR using genomic DNA from \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nobtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), catalog no. 29148D. DNA oligonucleotide primers for M17 variant were synthesized by Integrated DNA technologies, Inc. (IDT) according to the following nucleotide sequences: 1) 5′ CATATGCTGACTGCTCAGACTAAAAATAC 3′ (forward primer) (SEQ ID NO:11); 2) 5′ CTCGAGTTATCTTTCCGAATATCCTGCGAGAT 3′ (reverse primer) (SEQ ID NO:12). Primers were designed to introduce NdeI and XhoI endonuclease restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The resulting gene sequence was cloned into pET28a bacterial expression plasmid (EMD Biosciences) as an NdeI-XhoI fragment for subsequent recombinant expression into \nE. coli \nstrain BL21 (DE3), as an engineered fusion protein containing the sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH (SEQ ID NO:13) fused to the amino terminus of the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase beginning at the methionine at position 17 (M17).\n\n\nA \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase variant with a modified amino terminus that begins at position glutamine 26 (Q26) of the protein sequence listed in SEQ ID NO:2, was cloned into pET28a for recombinant expression as a fusion protein. The amino acid sequence and nucleic acid sequence encoding the Q26 variant are provided in SEQ ID NOs: 4 and 3, respectively DNA oligonucleotide primers for Q26 variant were synthesized by Integrated DNA technologies, Inc. (IDT) according to the following nucleotide sequences: 1) 5′ CAT ATG CAA ACA CTG ATG CCA CTC ACC GAA 3′ (forward primer) (SEQ ID NO:24) and 5′ CTCGAGTTATCTTTCCGAATATCCTGCGAGAT 3′ (reverse primer) (SEQ ID NO:12).\n\n\nBoth the full length, M17, and Q26 \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase fusion proteins were recombinantly expressed in \nE. coli\n, yielding soluble, highly active enzyme that was fully capable of cleaving heparin and heparan sulfate (see Example 2 below). [Sequence verified plasmid pET28 containing either the M17 coding sequence or Q26 coding sequence was transformed into BL21 (DE3). 2 liter cultures were grown at room temperature (˜20° C.) in LB media supplemented with 40 μg/mL kanamycin. Protein expression was induced with 500 μM IPTG added at an A\n600 \nof 1.0. Induced cultures were allowed to grow for 15-18 hours at room temperature.\n\n\nRecombinant \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase purification. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000×g for 15 minutes and resuspended in 30 mL of binding buffer (50 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole). Lysis was initiated by the addition of 0.1 mg/mL lysozyme (20 minutes at room temperature) followed by intermittent sonication in an ice-water bath using a Misonex XL sonicator at 40-50% output. The crude lysate was fractionated by low-speed centrifugation (20,000×g; 4° C.; 30 minutes) and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 micron filter. The 6×-His recombinant \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase was purified by Ni\n+2 \nchelation chromatography on a 5 mL Hi-Trap column (GE Healthcare,) pre-charged with 200 mM NiSO\n4 \nand subsequently equilibrated with binding buffer. The column was run at a flow rate of approximately 3 ml/minute that included an intermediate wash step with 50 mM imidazole. The lyase enzyme was eluted from the column in 5 mL fractions using high imidazole elution buffer (50 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole).\n\n\nThe resulting peak was buffer exchanged on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 20 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, pH 6.8, 150 mM NaCl.\n\n\nProtein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay and confirmed by UV spectroscopy. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and/or Sypro Ruby Red.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nDistinct Heparan Sulfate Substrate Specificities of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG Lyase I and \nF. heparinum \nHeparinases I and II\n\n\nThe cleavage patterns and thereby the substrate specificities of recombinant \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I and \nF. heparinum \nheparinases I and II were compared using heparan sulfate as a substrate. 200 μg of “HI” heparan sulfate (Celsus Labs) from porcine intestinal mucosa was digested with recombinant \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I under conditions favorable to ensure a complete digestion. The HI was contacted with about 50 μg \nB\n-\nthetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I, 50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.0 at 37° C. for 18 hours. The lyase digestion products were analyzed by HPLC using strong anion chromatography (SAX—HPLC). SAX—HPLC conditions were as follows: 50 μg samples was injected at 1 mg/ml into a 4×250 mm CarboPac PA1 analytical scale comlumn (Dionex Corporation). The flow rate was 1 ml/min. The mobile phase was 0.2M to 2 M NaCl in water, pH 3.5, gradient over 120 minutes. The column was preequilibrated with 0.2 M NaCl for 10 minutes. The results are shown in \nFIG. 6\n as trace A. \nFIG. 6\n trace B shows the results of the same experiment except that \nF. heparinum \nheparinase I was used to digest the heparan sulfate. Briefly, The HI was contacted with about 50 μg \nF. heparinum \nheparinase I, 25 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM calcium acetate, 5% glycine, pH 7.0 at 30° C. for 18 hours. This digestion profile is very similar to the profile in trace A, except that novel peaks are present in trace A (depicted by arrows) that are not present in trace B, demonstrating that the lyases have different substrate specificities. \nFIG. 6\n trace C shows the results of the same experiment except that \nF. heparinum \nheparinase II was used to digest the heparan sulfate. Briefly, The HI was contacted with about 50 μg \nF. heparinum \nheparinase II, 25 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM calcium acetate, pH 7.0 at 37° C. for 18 hours. In this case, the digestion profile is very much distinct from A (\nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase ) and B (\nF. heparinum \nheparinase I). These data demonstrate that the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase substrate specificity is distinct from the specificities of \nF. heparinum \nheparinases I and II, but is more “heparin like” (e.g., more similar to \nF. heparinum \nheparinase I) than “heparan sulfate-like” (e.g., it is less like \nF. heparinum \nheparinase II).\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nDepolymerization and Neutralization of ARIXTRA® by \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG Lyase I\n\n\nRecombinant \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I can cleave and thereby neutralize the ATIII pentasaccharide ARIXTRA® into a pentasulfated trisaccharide and an unsaturated disulfated disaccharide. ARIXTRA® is an anti-thrombotic drug that acts as a selective inhibitor of Factor Xa, a component of the coagulation cascade. Depolymerization of ARIXTRA® is unequivocally demonstrated by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) (\nFIG. 8\n). Panel A shows the scan of ARIXTRA® in the absence of a lyase. The structure of ARIXTRA® is also shown. Panel B shows the scan after cleavage of ARIXTRA® with \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase. Briefly, 1 mg/ml ARIXTRA® in a 20 μL reaction volume was treated with 5 μg \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase I, 25 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM calcium acetate, pH 7.0 at 37° C. for 2 hours. Note the disappearance in panel B of mass 4723.7 Da (net mass=1506 Da) present in panel A with concomitant appearance of mass 4133.2 Da (net mass=915.6 Da). The latter mass represents the pentasulfated trisaccharide cleavage product. In cleaving Arixtra into two smaller fragments, the drug's anti-Xa activity is effectively neutralized by the \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nCloning and Recombinant Expression of \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG Lyase II\n\n\nThe complete coding sequence of a \nB. thetaiotaomicron \nheparin/heparan sulfate lyase II (herein described as “full-length gene”) as well as the two variants described herein were cloned by PCR using genomic DNA from \nBacteroides thetaiotaomicron \nas obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), catalog no. 29148D. DNA oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA technologies (IDT), Inc. according to the following nucleotide sequences: 1) For the full-length gene: 5′ CAT ATG AAT AAA ACC CTG AAA TAT ATC GTC CTG 3′ (forward primer) (SEQ ID NO:14), 5′ CTC GAG TTA TAA TTT ATA TTT TAA TGA CTG TTT CTT GC 3′ (reverse primer) (SEQ ID NO:15); 2) Gene encoding variant No. 1 (amino terminal truncation to remove putative signal sequence): 5′ CAT ATG CAA GAG TTG AAA AGC GAG GTA TTC TCG 3′ (forward primer) (SEQ ID NO:16), 5′ CTC GAG TTA TAA TTT ATA TTT TAA TGA CTG TTT CTT GC 3′ (note: same reverse primer listed above as for full-length gene) (SEQ ID NO:15). Primers were designed to introduce \nNde\n 1 and \nXho\n 1 endonuclease restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Cloning of described gene sequence into pET28b bacterial expression plasmid (EMD Biosciences) as an Nde 1-\nXho\n 1 fragment for subsequent recombinant expression into \nE. coli \nstrain BL21 (DE3) as engineered fusion protein containing the sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMNKTLKY . . . KVNGKKQSLKYKL (SEQ ID NO:17) or MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMQELKSEVF . . . KVNGKKQSLKYKL (SEQ ID NO:18) for the full-length gene and variant 1 (the Q23 variant, SEQ ID NO:8), respectively (\nBacteroides thetaiotaomicron \nHSGAG lyase sequence is denoted in bold). See \nFIG. 4\n for complete sequence.\n\n\nAnother variant, the K169 variant (SEQ ID NO:10) represents an engineered deletion of 18 contiguous amino acids comprising an internal region within the protein and possessing the following linear sequence: KMDKKEYELVSDGKIKGE. (SEQ ID NO:19) Deletion of this region in the gene sequence (\nFIG. 4A\n) and in the corresponding protein sequence (\nFIG. 4B\n) is noted by grey shading. Deletion of this region at the DNA level was accomplished by PCR-based mutagenesis using the Quick-change kit (Stratagene) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Mutagenesis primers used to make this deletion at the gene (DNA) level were of the following sequence: 5′ GG ATT AAA AAG AAT CCG TTG GTG GAA AAT GTA CGT TTC GC 3′ (SEQ ID NO:20) and 5′ CC TAA TTT TTC TTA GGC AAC CAC CTT TTA CAT GCA AAG CG 3′ (SEQ ID NO:21) corresponding to the sense and anti-sense strands, respectively. Recombinant expression of this described gene variant in \nE. coli \nlikewise based on the pET-based expression for recombinant expression was also achieved.\n\n\nPreliminary biochemical characterization of this variant indicates that deletion of described amino acids is not deleterious to the soluble expression of the enzyme nor to its ability to cleave both heparin and heparan sulfate. It does suggest, however a potential difference in the substrate specificity of this enzyme variant relative to the full-length protein.\n\n\nEQUIVALENTS\n\n\nThose skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific embodiments of the invention described herein. Such equivalents are intended to be encompassed by the following claims."

Description\n\n\n\n\nPRIORITY CLAIM\n\n\nThis claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/445,868, filed Feb. 7, 2003, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\nFIELD\n\n\nThis application relates to the field of psychiatry. In particular, this application pertains to the discovery that agents that affect the movement of the facial muscles, such as botulism toxin, can be used in methods of ameliorating depression.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nThe mood and anxiety disorders in their various permutations constitute a major source of personal suffering and impaired ability to engage in productive work and interpersonal relationships. Between 5 and 9% of women and between 2 and 3% of men meet the diagnostic criteria for major depression at any time; 10-25% of all women suffer major depression sometime in their lives, while 5-10% of men will develop major depressive disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1994).\n\n\nAffective disorders, while characterized by depressed mood of varying degrees, exist in various forms. The various forms of depression are defined and are separately diagnosed according to criteria given in handbooks for psychiatry, for example in the \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \n4th edition (DSM-IV) published by the American Psychiatric Association, Washington, D.C. (1994). In the DSM-IV, depressive disorders are classified under mood disorders and are divided into three types: major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder and depressive disorder not otherwise specified (or “atypical”). In general, regardless of whether or not the depressive syndrome is melancholic, atypical, or some admixture of the two, a diagnosis of major depression is given when depressed mood is present, or loss of interest or pleasure in all activities is present, for at least two weeks.\n\n\nThus, melancholic depression is characterized by continuously depressed mood and pervasive hopelessness, insomnia with early-morning awakening (with the inability to return to sleep), loss of appetite and weight loss, and excessive feelings of guilt. In contrast, so-called “atypical” depression is characterized by hypersomnia (oversleeping), hyperphagia and weight gain, and—often—mood reactivity.\n\n\nMajor depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder are differentiated based on chronicity, severity and persistence. If less severe or incapacitating, depressed mood is considered dysthymia. Depressed mood can occur in the form of a cycling mood abnormality such as bipolar mood disorder, cyclothymia, or menstrual-related mood disorder. In dysthymic disorder the depressed mood must be present most days over a period of two years.\n\n\nUsually, major depressive disorder is characterized by its sharp contrast to usual functioning. A person with a major depressive episode can be functioning and feeling normal and suddenly develop severe symptoms of depression. By contrast, a person with dysthymic disorder has chronic depression with less severe symptoms than major depression. Major depression is a major health problem and poses a tremendous financial burden on society due to lost self-support of individuals suffering from depression. Such individuals are often simply unable to function in everyday life situations, in part because of feelings of extreme hopelessness and worthlessness. There is also a serious risk of suicide among such individuals. The diagnostic criteria for major depression are well known to those skilled in the art, and comprise the criteria set forth, for example, at DSM-IV 296.2 and 296.3.\n\n\nPsychotic major depression has long been recognized as a distinct psychiatric illness, having both psychotic and depressive components. In a differential diagnosis, it is important that psychotic major depression be distinguished from non-psychotic major depression, because effective treatments and patterns of response to pharmacologic therapies for psychotic major depression are often different from those relating to non-psychotic major depression. Successful treatment depends on the accuracy of the initial diagnosis. (Glassman, \nArch. Gen. Psychiatry \n38:424-427, 1981, Schatzberg, \nAm. J. Psychiatr. \n149:733-745, 1992, Schatzberg, \nAnnals N.Y. Acad. of Sci. \n537:462, 1988). Psychotic major depression is very common. It has been estimated that twenty five percent of depressed patients admitted to the hospital have psychotic major depression (Coryell \nNerv. Ment. Dis. \n172:521, 1984).\n\n\nMood and anxiety disorders very frequently coexist in the same individual. In this regard, it is now appreciated that almost all antidepressants improve anxiety symptoms. Conversely, the most popular anxiolytics, the benzodiazepines, improve mood acutely but are typically ineffective or harmful to mood during chronic use.\n\n\nThe current psychopharmacologic treatments of affective and anxiety disorders have certain drawbacks. A significant portion of depressed patients are resistant to treatment with existing antidepressants or combinations thereof either because of non-responsiveness or because a positive effect wears off (breakthrough depression) or is inadequate (depression in partial remission). Troubling side effects, such as gastrointestinal disturbances or loss of libido, may also be seen with existing antidepressants. Moreover, current psychopharmacologic anti-depressants have a latency of typically two weeks before the onset of significant antidepressant activity. The most commonly used anxiolytic medications, the benzodiazepines, have a number of major limitations: (a) tolerance to their effects rapidly develops, with increasing doses becoming required to achieve the same effect; (b) benzodiazepine dependence is a standard occurrence after chronic use; (c) major withdrawal syndromes are seen—including grand mal seizures—after abrupt discontinuation; (d) overdose is associated with respiratory depression and sometimes death; (e) effects are potentiated by alcohol, which is cross-tolerant with the benzodiazepines; and (f) high abuse potential.\n\n\nDepression is often associated with psychomotor abnormalities, such as increased or retarded motor activity. Many depressed persons can also be recognized by their “depressed facies” in which the muscles of facial expression assume a distressed or sad appearance. For example, the brow may be furrowed, the inner ends of the eyebrows raised, and the angles of the mouth lowered such that the facial appearance is recognizably sad and/or anxious.\n\n\nAlthough treatments for different types of depression do exist, there is a continuous search for new methods of treatment. Existing therapeutic approaches still have disadvantages, such as the side effects of drugs, the long duration of treatments, and more importantly, the partial efficacy (or inefficacy) of existing treatments. Although some existing treatments are effective, there is still a need for alternative treatments, or therapeutic approaches that can be used in combination with existing treatment modalities.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nA method is provided herein for treating depression. The method includes administering to a person with an affective disorder a therapeutically effective amount of drug that interferes with the ability of the facial muscles to assume a depressed facies. For example, a neurotoxin is administered to a facial muscle involved in frowning or scowling. The neurotoxin affects the ability of the subject to frown and/or scowl, thereby treating depression. In one such method, a therapeutically effective amount of Botulinum toxin A can be injected into one or more of the frontalis, procerus, the corrugator supercilii, orbicularis oculi, or the depressor anguli oris (trianglaris muscle). Four major muscle groups are involved in frowning: the frontail, procerus, corrugator supercilii and orbicularis oculi (Weider et al. \nDerm Surg. \n24:1172-1174, 1998. The corrugator supercilii is also known as the “scowl” muscle. In a particular example, the Botulinum toxin A is injected into the procerus muscle over the glabella.\n\n\nThe foregoing and other features and advantages will become more apparent from the following detailed description of several embodiments, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.\n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n is a schematic diagram of a frontal view of the musculature of the human face and neck.

Terms\n\n\nUnless otherwise noted, technical terms are used according to conventional usage. Definitions of common terms in molecular biology may be found in Benjamin Lewin, \nGenes V\n, published by Oxford University Press, 1994 (ISBN 0-19-854287-9); Kendrew et al. (eds.), \nThe Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology\n, published by Blackwell Science Ltd., 1994 (ISBN 0-632-02182-9); and Robert A. Meyers (ed.), \nMolecular Biology and Biotechnology: a Comprehensive Desk Reference\n, published by VCH Publishers, Inc., 1995 (ISBN 1-56081-569-8).\n\n\nIn order to facilitate review of the various embodiments of this disclosure, the following explanations of specific terms are provided:\n\n\nAmeliorating or ameliorate: Any indicia of success in the treatment of a pathology or condition, including any objective or subjective parameter such as abatement, remission or diminishing of symptoms or an improvement in a patient's physical or mental well-being. Amelioration of symptoms can be based on objective or subjective parameters; including the results of a physical examination and/or a psychiatric evaluation. For example, a clinical guide to monitor the effective amelioration of a psychiatric disorder, such as depression, is found in the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I mood disorders (“SCID-P”) (see fourth edition of \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \n(1994) Task Force on DSM-IV, American Psychiatric Association (“DSM-IV”); Kaplan, Ed. (1995); \nComprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry/VI\n, vol. 1, sixth ed., pp 621-627, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md.).\n\n\nAnti-Depressant Medications: A pharmaceutical agent that is administered as a treatment for depression. Anti-depressant medications include synthesized chemical compounds as well as naturally occurring or herbal remedies such as St. John's Wort. Generally, these medications are administered orally, but they may also be administered in any form of use to a medical practitioner. Examples of antidepressant medications include tricyclic antidepressants, which generally affect the two chemical neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and serotonin. Tricyclics include imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are also used as antidepressants. MAOIs approved for the treatment of depression include phenelzine (NARDIL®), tranylcypromine (PARNATE®), and isocarboxazid (MARPLAN®). Medications that primarily affect the neurotransmitter serotonin, termed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are also used as antidepressants. These include escitalopram HBr (LEXAPRO®), fluoxetine (PROZAC®), sertraline (ZOLOFT®), fluvoxamine (LUVOX®), paroxetine (PAXIL®), and citalopram (CELEXA). Additional medication of use affect both norepinephrine and serotonin, for example venlafaxine (EFFEXOR®) and nefazadone (SERZONE®), or agents such as phenelzine (NARDIL®), tranylcypromine (PARNATE®), mirtazepine (REMERON®), nefazodone (SERZONE®), triazolopyridine (TRAZODONE®), and bupropion (WELLBUTRIN®).\n\n\nBotulinum toxin: A toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, but which may either be obtained from a natural source or made by synthetic means. Seven immunologically distinct Botulinum neurotoxins have been characterized, these being respectively Botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A, B, C\n1\n, D, E, F and G, each of which is distinguished by neutralization with type-specific antibodies. The different serotypes of Botulinum toxin vary in the animal species that they affect and in the severity and duration of the paralysis they evoke. For example, it has been determined that Botulinum toxin type A is 500 times more potent, as measured by the rate of paralysis produced in the rat, than is Botulinum toxin type B. Additionally, Botulinum toxin type B has been determined to be non-toxic in primates at a dose of 480 U/kg which is about 12 times the primate LD\n50 \nfor Botulinum toxin type A (Moyer et al., “Botulinum Toxin Type B: Experimental and Clinical Experience,” in \nTherapy With Botulinum Toxin\n, Marcel Dekker, Inc Jankovic et al. (eds.), pgs. 71-85, 1994).\n\n\nDepression: A mental state of depressed mood characterized by feelings of sadness, despair and discouragement. Depression includes feelings of sadness considered to be normal (mild depression), dysthymia, and major depression. Depression can resemble the grief and mourning that follows bereavement, and there are often feelings of low self esteem, guilt and self reproach, withdrawal from interpersonal contact and somatic symptoms such as alterations in eating habits and sleep disturbances.\n\n\nFrown: To furrow the brow to show unhappiness or displeasure. This action uses the orbicularis oculi, the frontalis muscle and/or the corrugator supercilii muscle. This action can also include the use of the procerus muscle.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable carriers: The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers useful in this invention are conventional. \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\n, by E. W. Martin, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 15th Edition (1975), describes compositions and formulations suitable for pharmaceutical delivery of the fusion proteins herein disclosed.\n\n\nIn general, the nature of the carrier will depend on the particular mode of administration being employed. In addition to biologically-neutral carriers, pharmaceutical compositions to be administered can contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives, and pH buffering agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate or sorbitan monolaurate.\n\n\nPsychotic: A psychiatric condition in its broadest sense, as defined in the DSM-WV (Kaplan, ed. (1995) supra) and described below. Different disorders which have a psychotic component comprise different aspects of this definition of “psychotic.” For example, in schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder and brief psychotic disorder, the term “psychotic” refers to delusions, any prominent hallucinations, disorganized speech, or disorganized or catatonic behavior. In psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition and in substance-induced psychotic disorder, “psychotic” refers to delusions or only those hallucinations that are not accompanied by insight. Finally, in delusional disorder and shared psychotic disorder, “psychotic” is equivalent to “delusional” (see DSM-IV, supra, page 273).\n\n\nObjective tests can be used to determine whether an individual is psychotic and to measure and assess the success of a particular treatment schedule or regimen. For example, measuring changes in cognitive ability aids in the diagnosis and treatment assessment of the psychotic patient. Any test known in the art can be used, such as the so-called “Wallach Test,” which assesses recognition memory (see below, Wallach, \nJ. Gerontol. \n35:371-375, 1980). Another example of an objective text that can be used to determine whether an individual is psychotic and to measure efficacy of an anti-psychotic treatment is the Stroop Color and Word Test (“Stroop Test”) (see Golden, C. J., Cat. No. 30150M, in \nA Manual for Clinical and Experimental Uses\n, Stoelting, Wood Dale, Ill.). The Stroop Test is an objective neuropsychiatric test that can differentiate between individuals with psychosis and those without.\n\n\nPsychosis: A psychiatric symptom, condition or syndrome in its broadest sense, as defined in the DSM-IV (Kaplan, ed. (1995) supra), comprising a “psychotic” component, as broadly defined above. Psychosis is typically defined as a mental disorder or condition causing gross distortion or disorganization of a person's mental capacity, affective response, and capacity to recognize reality, communicate, and relate to others to the degree of interfering with his capacity to cope with the ordinary demands of everyday life.\n\n\nPsychotic major depression: A condition also referred to as psychotic depression (Schatzberg, \nAm. J Psychiatry \n149:733-745, 1992), “psychotic (delusional) depression,” “delusional depression,” and “major depression with psychotic features” (see the DSM-III-R). This condition is a distinct psychiatric disorder that includes both depressive and psychotic features. Individuals manifesting both depression and psychosis, i.e. psychotic depression, are often referred to as “psychotic depressives.”\n\n\nScowl: A facial expression showing displeasure. Scowling primarily utilizes the corrugator supercilii muscle and the procerus muscle.\n\n\nSubject: Any mammal. In one embodiment, a subject is a human subject.\n\n\nTherapeutically effective amount: A quantity of treatment, such as drug, for example a neurotoxin such as Botulinum toxin A, sufficient to achieve a desired effect in a subject being treated. For instance, this can be the amount of Botulinum toxin A necessary to impair contraction of, or paralyze, a facial muscle. This can also be the amount of a therapy, such as light therapy or psychotherapy, sufficient to relieve a symptom of a disorder, such as depression. This can also be the amount of an antidepressant sufficient to alter the mood of a subject.\n\n\nUnit equivalents: An amount of Botulinum Toxin (BTX) that is equivalent to standard Units of Botulinum Toxin A (BTX-A). A standard Unit of BTX-A is defined as the mean LD\n50 \nfor female Swiss Webster mice weighing 18-20 grams (Schantz and Kaultner, \nJ. Assoc. Anal. Chem. \n61: 96-99, 1978). The estimated human LD\n50 \nfor a 70-kg person is 40 Units/kg or about 2500-3000 Units.\n\n\nBOTOX™ (Botulinum toxin A, Allergan, Inc., Irvine, Calif., U.S.A.) is sold in 100 Unit vials. DYSPORT™ (Speywood Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Maidenhead, U.K.) is sold in 500 Unit vials. For cosmetic uses, the vial contents are typically diluted with 1 or 2 ml of sterile saline solution, which for BOTOX™ provides a 100 or 50 Unit/ml dilution. DYSPORT™ BTX-A is roughly tenfold less toxic than BOTOX™ and approximately fourfold greater amounts of the DYSPORT™ product will usually be injected to achieve the same result as would be obtained using a specific number of Units of BOTOX™.\n\n\nUnless otherwise explained, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. The singular terms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Similarly, the word “or” is intended to include “and” unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It is further to be understood that all base sizes or amino acid sizes, and all molecular weight or molecular mass values, given for nucleic acids or polypeptides are approximate, and are provided for description. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of this disclosure, suitable methods and materials are described below. The term “comprises” means “includes.” All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including explanations of terms, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.\n\n\nBotulinum Toxin\n\n\nBotulinum toxin (BTX), produced by the bacterium \nClostridium botulinum \nreversibly paralyzes striated muscle when administered in sub-lethal doses. BTX has been used in the treatment in a number of neuromuscular disorders and conditions involving muscular spasm including, but not limited to, dystonia, hemifacial spasm, tremor, spasticity (e.g. resulting from multiple sclerosis), anal fissures and various ophthalmologic conditions (for example, see Carruthers et al., \nJ. Amer. Acad. Derm. \n34:788-797, 1996). A Botulinum toxin type A complex has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of blepharospasm, strabismus and hemifacial spasm.\n\n\nBTX is a generic term covering a family of toxins produced by \nC. botulinum \ncomprising up to eight serologically distinct forms (A, B, C\n1\n, C\n2\n, D, E, F and G). These toxins are among the most powerful neuroparalytic agents known (c.f. Melling et al., Eye 2:16-23, 1988). Serotypes A, B and F are the most potent. Without being bound by theory, the mode of action is believed to be an inhibition of the release of acetylcholine by the presynaptic nerve.\n\n\nBotulinum toxin type A can be obtained by establishing and growing cultures of \nClostridium botulinum \nin a fermenter and then harvesting and purifying the fermented mixture in accordance with known procedures. Alternatively, the Botulinum toxin serotypes are initially synthesized as inactive single chain proteins which must be cleaved or nicked by proteases to become neuroactive. High quality crystalline Botulinum toxin type A can be produced from the Hall A strain of \nClostridium botulinum\n. The Schantz process can be used to obtain crystalline Botulinum toxin type A (see Schantz et al., \nMicrobiol Rev. \n56; 80-99, 1992). Generally, the Botulinum toxin type A complex can be isolated and purified from an anaerobic fermentation by cultivating \nClostridium botulinum \ntype A in a suitable medium. This process can be used, upon separation out of the non-toxin proteins, to obtain pure Botulinum toxins, such as for example: purified Botulinum toxin type A with an approximately 150 kD molecular weight, purified Botulinum toxin type B with an approximately 156 kD molecular weight and purified Botulinum toxin type F with an approximately 155 kD molecular weight.\n\n\nBotulinum toxins and/or Botulinum toxin complexes can be obtained from List Biological Laboratories, Inc., Campbell, Calif.; the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research, Porton Down, U.K.; Wako, Osaka, Japan; Metabiologics, Madison, Wis.) as well as from Sigma Chemicals, St Louis, Mo.\n\n\nThe initial cosmetic use of BTX was for treatment of forehead frown lines as reported in Carruthers and Carruthers, \nJ. Dermatol. Surg. Oncol. \n18:17-21, 1992. The clinical effects of peripheral intramuscular Botulinum toxin type A are usually seen within one week of injection. The typical duration of symptomatic relief from a single intramuscular injection of Botulinum toxin type A averages about three months. BTX-A serotype is available commercially for pharmaceutical use under the trademarks BOTOX™ (Allergan, Inc., Irvine, Calif., U.S.A.) and DYSPORT™ (Speywood Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Maidenhead, U. K.). BOTOX™ consists of a purified Botulinum toxin type A complex, albumin and sodium chloride packaged in sterile, vacuum-dried form. Specifically, each vial of BOTOX™ contains about 100 Units (U) of \nClostridium botulinum \ntoxin type A purified neurotoxin complex, 0.5 milligrams of human serum albumin and 0.9 milligrams of sodium chloride in a sterile, vacuum-dried form without a preservative.\n\n\nThe Botulinum toxin type A is made from a culture of the Hall strain of \nClostridium botulinum \ngrown in a medium containing N-Z amine and yeast extract.\n\n\nThe Botulinum toxin type A complex is purified from the culture solution by a series of acid precipitations to a crystalline complex consisting of the active high molecular weight toxin protein and an associated hemagglutinin protein. The crystalline complex is re-dissolved in a solution containing saline and albumin and sterile filtered (0.2 microns) prior to vacuum-drying. The vacuum-dried product is stored in a freezer at or below −5° C.\n\n\nBOTOX™ is sold in 100 Unit vials. DYSPORT™ is sold in 500 Unit vials. BTX-A is roughly tenfold less toxic than BOTOX™ and approximately fourfold greater amounts of the DYSPORT™ product will usually be injected to achieve the same result as would be obtained using a specific number of Units of BOTOX™.\n\n\nFor cosmetic uses, the vial contents are typically diluted with 1 or 2 ml of sterile saline solution, which for BOTOX™ provides a 100 or 50 Unit/ml dilution. (DYSPORT™ can also be utilized.) For example, BOTOX™ can be reconstituted with sterile, non-preserved saline prior to intramuscular injection. To reconstitute vacuum-dried BOTOX™, sterile normal saline without a preservative (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection) is used by drawing up the proper amount of diluent in the appropriate size syringe. Since BOTOX™ may be denatured by bubbling or similar violent agitation, the diluent is gently injected into the vial. For sterility reasons BOTOX™ is preferably administered within four hours after the vial is removed from the freezer and reconstituted. During these four hours, reconstituted BOTOX™ can be stored in a refrigerator at about 2° C. to about 8° C. Reconstituted, refrigerated BOTOX™ has been reported to retain its potency for at least about two weeks (see \nNeurology, \n48:249-53:1997).\n\n\nMethods for Treatment of Depression\n\n\nA method is provided herein for treating depression. The method includes administering a therapeutically effective amount of an agent (such as a neurotoxin) to a facial muscle involved in frowning, scowling, or a sad appearance. The agent causes partial or complete paralysis of the facial muscle, thereby affecting the ability of the subject to frown and/or scowl, or appear sad, and thereby treat depression. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of BTX can be injected into one or more of the orbicularis oculi, frontalis, procerus, the corrugator supercilii, or the depressor anguli oris (trianglaris muscle).\n\n\nThe method involves identifying or selecting persons who are depressed, and administering the treatment to them. Any form of depression can be treated herein, including mild depression, dysthymia and major depression. The depression can be the result of a mood disorder, and may be accompanied by an anxiety disorder. Without being bound by theory, decreased movement of muscles that contribute to the depressed facies helps elevate mood, and thus a lessening of the feeling of depression ensues. Denervation of the frown and scowl muscles results in a decreased ability of the treated subject to frown or scowl, and thus contributes to a subjective sense of elevated mood. Such improved mood can be objectively assessed by the DSM-IV criteria, or by standardized tests known in the art to determine whether a subject is depressed. Depression can be assessed, for example, by the \nBeck Depression Inventory II \n(1996, Harcourt). A very straightforward test is to ask the subject to report whether his or her mood has improved, or to rate feelings of depression on a numerical scale. Specific questions can also be asked about feelings of sadness and hopelessness, as well as changes in physical signs and symptoms associated with depression, such a neurovegetative complaints or psychomotor retardation.\n\n\nThe treatment can be repeated when the partial or complete muscle paralysis induced by the agent begins to abate. Alternatively, one can also wait for any signs or symptoms of depression to also recur after the muscular activity returns.\n\n\nAn exemplary injection technique involves the use of a short, narrow needle (e.g. ½ inch or 8 mm; 30-gauge) with an insulin- or tuberculin-type syringe. Subjects are typically treated in the seated position. The skin area is cleaned with an alcohol swab. A single syringe may be used for multiple injections to treat different locations in a single muscle or different locations on a patient's face. Typically, the plunger of the syringe is depressed as the needle is withdrawn so that toxin is evenly distributed at the injection site. Pressure or gentle massage may be applied at the injection site to assist in dissipating the toxin. The toxin will typically migrate approximately 1 cm from the site of injection.\n\n\nElectromyographic (EMG) guided needles may be used for injection to determine needle location of a high degree of accuracy, although this technique is generally not necessary.\n\n\nFor applications of BTX, total dose per treatment can be varied and depends upon the condition being treated and the site of application of BTX. For example, a total dose of 10-50 Units (such as about 20 to about 40 Unit equivalents) will typically be applied to the glabellar complex and 60-75 Units for platysmal bands (Carruthers and Carruthers, \nDermatol. Surg. \n24:1168-1170, 1998). In one specific non-limiting example, about 30 to about 50 Unit equivalents of BTX is administered to the frontalis and/or the procerus muscle.\n\n\nOnset of muscle paralysis following injection usually occurs within hours of treatment. The duration of paralysis will vary from patient to patient. Typically, duration will be from two to eight months, for example about three to about six months, or for example about three months, before subsequent treatment is required to alleviate the condition, although Botulinum toxin type A can have an efficacy for up to 12 months (Naumann et al., \nEuropean J. Neurology \n6(Supp 4):S111-S115, 1999).\n\n\nThus, in one specific, non-limiting example, to treat depression, a muscle involved in frowning or scowling is treated repeatedly. For example, about 30 to about 50 Unit equivalents of BTX is administered to the frontalis and/or the procerus muscle. After a period of about three months, and additional about 30 to about 50 Unit equivalents of BTX is administered to the corrugator supercilii, orbicularis oculi, procerus, and/or frontalis muscle. This treatment can be administered as many times as need to alleviate depression of the subject.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 2 and 3\n show Botulinum toxin dose used to treat the frown and/or scowl in a typical woman (\nFIG. 2\n) and man (\nFIG. 3\n). The landmarks for the injection are as follows (see also Carruthers et al., \nDerm. Surg. \n24:1189-1194, 1998). The injection of the procerus is below a line joining the medial end of both eyebrows. The landmark for the next injections is a line vertically above the inner canthus and the superior margin of the orbit. Botulinum toxin is injected just superior to the first injection point. Next an injection is made 1 cm above the bone rim in the midpupullary line. The numbers refer to the number of BTX Units injected in the area shown.\n\n\nIn one specific, non-limiting example, for those patients with a sad appearance to their mouth, BTX is injected into the depressor anguli oris muscle. In such treatment, the orbicularis oris muscle surrounding the mouth is normally avoided in view of its sensitivity to BTX.\n\n\nThe depressor anguli oris can be found by instructing the patient to voluntarily and forcibly pull down the corners of the mouth. The depressor anguli oris can be then felt by pulling inferiorly at a point approximately 1 cm lateral and 8 mm inferior to the commissure. Alternatively, EMG localization may be performed.\n\n\nTreatment should take into consideration the pre-existing symmetry of the mouth and is performed on both sides of the face in order to provide a symmetric result. The required dosage to each side of the mouth should be judged and if necessary, altered upon re-treatment.\n\n\nInjection may be made into any part of the depressor anguli oris musculature. The injection is intramuscular and may be performed using the injection techniques used for other BTX treatments as described above. On a typical patient's face, an exemplary point of injection into the depressor anguli oris is approximately 1 cm laterally and 8 mm inferior from the corner of the mouth. A single injection will usually suffice with the dosage for a single depressor anguli oris muscle ranging from 3 (±10%) Units to 5 (±10%) Units. However, the dose depends upon the sex of the subject and size of the individual. Exemplary doses for a female are 2 (±10%) Units-3 (±10%) Units for one side of the mouth; and, for a male, 3 (±10%) Units to 5 (±10%) Units for one side of the mouth. Treatment generally does not affect normal speech, whistling or mastication particularly in cases where the orbicularis oris is not treated.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount of BTX is administered in combination with at least one additional modality of treatment for depression. The modality can be the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of an antidepressant. The modality of treatment can also be physical, such as electroconvulsive therapy, light therapy, or electromagnetic radiation. The modality can also be psychotherapy or exercise. A single modality of treatment can be combined with the BTX treatment, or a combination of additional modalities can be used with the BTX treatment. In particular examples, the additional modality is the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of an antidepressant medication, such as a tricyclic antidepressant or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), or other classes of drugs (such as an MAOI or a tricyclic antidepressant). The BTX can be administered simultaneously or sequentially with the additional modality of treatment. Thus, in one example, a subject taking a therapeutically effective amount of an antidepressant medication (such as an SSRI), or undergoing a therapeutic protocol, can be treated with BTX during the course of the additional treatment. Alternatively, BTX can be administered after the treatment has been terminated, or prior to the initiation of therapy, such as the administration of the antidepressant medication, psychotherapy, or a physical treatment protocol. In one specific example, BTX is administered to a subject who is also taking a therapeutically effective amount of an SSRI.\n\n\nThis disclosure is illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nPatient 1\n\n\nA 59-year-old Caucasian female with a history of depression for 3 years was treated. Medications included PAXIL® (20 mg), as prescribed by her psychiatrist. She appeared somewhat depressed at the time of the first office visit. Her glabellar frown lines and forehead lines were treated with 40 i.u. of BOTOX™ (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\nThree months later the patient returned for re-treatment. The patient stated that she no longer felt depressed and she attributed her improvement in her mood to the BOTOX™. Her glabellar frown lines and forehead lines were treated with 40 i.u. of BOTOX™. In a telephone follow-up interview two months later, the patient reported feeling well and that she was no longer depressed.\n\n\nThis example illustrates that BOTOX™ injection can be used in combination with other treatment modalities (such as antidepressant medications, for example tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and others). It is also anticipated that the injection could be used in combination with other therapies, such as psychotherapy.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nPatient 2\n\n\nA 33-year-old Caucasian female with a history of intermittent anxiety/depression for ten years was treated. Her medications included an SSRI (ZOLOFT®, 200 mg per day) for the last four years. Prior to treatment she reported feeling depressed and anxious.\n\n\nHer frown/glabellar lines were injected with 30 Unit equivalents of BOTOX™ (\nFIG. 5\n). Three months later she returned to the office for a follow-up appointment. She stated that she felt happier during the last couple of months than she had in years. Her frown/glabellar lines were re-treated at that time with 30 Unit equivalents of BOTOX™.\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n \nPatient\n 3\n\n\nA 50-year-old, recently divorced, Caucasian female was treated.

Further, SALL4 shutdown induces cancer stem cells to undergo apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest, which cells can be rescued by SALL4 downstream targets, including Bmi-1.\n\n\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\n\n[0002] ES cells derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst are able to undergo self-renewing cell division and maintain their pluripotency over an indefinite period of time. ES cells can also differentiate into a variety of different cell types when cultured in vitro. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been associated with the self-renewal of normal human stem cells (HSCs) and the granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Further, the transcriptional factor, OCT4, has been identified as a key regulator for the formation of ICM during preimplantation development. Moreover, OCT4 protein seems to plays a central role in maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells by regulating a wide range of genes.\n\n\n[0003] The role of stem cells has been considered in the etiology of cancer. There has been increasing evidence that tumors might contain such cancer stems cells, i.e., rare cells that account for the growth of tumors. These rare cells with indefinite proliferative potential may account for the resistance observed for cancer cells in response to conventional therapeutic modalities. It is known that stem cells can be identified in adult tissues, where such cells arise from a specific tissue; e.g., hematopoietic cells. As the self renewal property\n\n\nWEST\\2141\n3\n0\n5\n0.1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n of stem cells is tightly controlled in normal organogenesis, the de-regulation of self-renewal might result in carcinogenesis.\n\n\n[0004] Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), for example, is a hematological disease marked by the accumulation of genomic abnormalities at the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) level leading to pancytopenia, multilineage differentiation impairment, and bone marrow apoptosis.\n\n\n[0005] Mortality in this disease results from pancytopenia or transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML is a hematological cancer characterized by the accumulation of immature myeloid precursors in the bone marrow and peripheral blood.\n\n\n[0006] From the analysis of genetic translocation in bone marrow samples from AML patients, it is clear that transcription factors critical for hematopoiesis play an important role in leukemogenesis. The pathogenesis of AML is considered to involve multistep genetic alternations. Because only HSCs are considered to have the ability to self-renew, they are the best candidates for the accumulation of multistep, preleukemic genetic changes and transforming them into so-called \"leukemia stem cells\" (LSCs).\n\n\n[0007] Alternatively, downstream progenitors can acquire self-renewal capacity and give rise to leukemia. LSCs are not targeted specifically under current chemotherapy regimens yet such cells have been found to account for drug resistance and leukemia relapse.\n\n\n[0008] The SALL gene family, SALLl, SALL2, SALL3, and SALL4, were originally cloned on the basis of their DNA sequence homology to Drosophila spall (sal). In Drosophila, spalt is a homeotic gene essential for development of posterior head and anterior tail segments. It plays an important role in tracheal development, terminal differentiation of photoreceptors, and wing vein placement. In humans, the SALL gene family is associated with normal development, as well as tumorigenesis. SALL proteins belong to a group of C\n2\nH\n2\n zinc finger transcription factors characterized by multiple finger domains distributed over the entire protein. During the tracheal development of Drosophila, spalt is an activated downstream target of Wingless, a Wnt ortholog. It has been demonstrated that SALLl interacts with β-catenin by functioning as a coactivator, suggesting that the interaction between SALL and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is bidirectional.\n\n\nWEST\\214130\n5\n0 1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0009] The present invention relates to SALL4, a human homolog to Drosophila spalt, which is a zinc finger transcriptional factor essential for development. SALL4 and its isoforms (SALL4A, SALL4B, and SALL4C) were cloned and sequenced. The present disclosure demonstrates that SALL4 failed to be turned off in human primary AML. Further, the leukemogenic potential of constitutive expression of SALL4 in a murine model is demonstrated. Moreover, SALL4B-transgenic mice which develop myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-like signs and symptoms and subsequent transplantable AML are described.\n\n\n[0010] Increased apoptosis associated with dysmyelopoiesis is evident in transgenic mouse marrow and colony-formation (CFU) assays. Both isoforms are able to bind to β-catenin and synergistically enhance the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This demonstrates that the constitutive expression of SALL4 causes MDS/AML, and that such expression impinges on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In a related aspect, the murine model disclosed provides a platform to study human MDS/AML transformation, and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway's role in the pathogenesis of leukemia stem cells.\n\n\n[0011] In one embodiment, an antibody or antibody fragment is disclosed which binds to a polypeptide that includes an amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 13.\n\n\n[0012] In another embodiment, a method of treating myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in a subject is disclosed, including administering a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody which binds to a polypeptide that includes an amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 13 to the subject.\n\n\n[0013] In another embodiment, a method of treating myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in a subject is provided, including administering to the subject a composition of a polynucleotide having a sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 5, a complement of SEQ ID NO: 1, a complement of SEQ ID NO: 3, a complement of SEQ ID NO: 5, and fragments thereof including at least 15 consecutive nucleotides of a polynucleotide encoding the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4, or SEQ ID NO:6.\n\n\nWESTV21413050. 1 356077-000029 \n\n [0014] In one embodiment, a method of treating myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in a subject is disclosed, including administering to the subject a polypeptide composition having a sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4 and/or SEQ ID NO: 6.\n\n\n[0015] In a related aspect, the MDS is acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n\n\n[0016] In one embodiment, a method of diagnosing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in a subject is disclosed, including, providing a biological sample from the subject, contacting the biological sample with a probe comprising a fragment of at least 15 consecutive nucleotides of a polynucleotide having a sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 5, a complement of SEQ ID NO: 1, a complement of SEQ ID NO: 3, or a complement of SEQ ID NO: 5 under hybridization conditions, and detecting the hybridization between the probe and the biological sample, where detecting of hybridization correlates with MDS.\n\n\n[0017] In another embodiment, a method of diagnosing a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in a subject is disclosed, including providing a biological sample from the subject, contacting the biological sample with an antibody which binds to a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4, or SEQ ID NO: 6, and detecting the binding of the antibody to the sample, where detecting binding correlates with MDS.\n\n\n[0018] In one embodiment, a method for isolating leukemia stem cells is provided, including obtaining a sample of cells from a subject, sorting cells that express a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 13 from cells that do not express the amino acid sequence, and selecting, by a myeloid surface marker, leukemia stem cells from the sample of cells that express the polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 13.\n\n\n[0019] In another embodiment, a transgenic animal having a human SALL4 gene is provided, where the animal is modified to expresses a sequence of a human SALL4 gene comprising nucleotides encoding an amino acid as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4, or SEQ ID\n\n\nNO: 6.

No.: AYl 72738]; SALL4B, SEQ ID NO: 3[GenBank Ace. No. AY170621]); and SALL4C, SEQ ID NO: 5 [GenBank Ace. No. AY170622]. Alternative splicing generates two variant forms of S ALL4 niRNA. Figure 1 (a) S ALL4 A and S ALL4B vary in protein length and in the presence of different numbers of characteristic sal-like zinc finger domains. SALL4A (encoding 1,067 amino acids) contains eight zinc finger domains, while SALL4B (encoding 623 amino acids) has three zinc finger domains. SALL4C contains 276 amino acids and lacks the region corresponding to amino acids 43 to 820 of the full length SALL4A. Both variants have exons 1, 3, and 4, and SALL4A contains all exons from 1 to 4. However, SALL4B uses an alternative splice acceptor that results in deletion of the large 3' portion of exon 2. Figure l(b) shows the RT-PCR analysis of SALL4 variants in different tissues. Four exons of SALL4 and their potential coding structures are illustrated, with arrows indicating the primers used for PCR amplification of the SALL4 transcripts (A). Tissue- dependent expression of S ALL4 transcripts by RT-PCR (B). A 315-bp expected product that was specific for SALL4A with primers Al (exon 2) and Bl (exon 4) was amplified with cDNAs of various tissues. Primers Dl (exon 4) and Cl (exon 1) were used to amplify the 1,851-bp expected product of SALL4B. Comparable amounts of cDN A were determined by GAPDH. Figure 1 (c) shows S ALL4 protein products, S ALL4A, and S ALL4B identified by a S ALL4 peptide antibody. Lysates from Cos-7 cells transiently expressing His-SALL4B (lane 1), His- S ALL4A (lane 2), or control vector (lane 8), or lysates from different human tissues were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the N-terminal SALL4 peptide antibody.\n\n\n[0045] Figure 2 demonstrates the expression of SALL4 in human primary AML and myeloid leukemia cell lines. Real-time PCR quantification of SALL4A and SALL4B normalized to GAPDH showed that both SALL4A and SALL4B were expressed in purified CD34+ cells, but SALL4A was rapidly downregulated and SALL4B turned off in normal bone marrow (N=3) and normal peripheral blood (N=3) cells. In contrast, in 15 primary AML samples and three myeloid leukemia cell lines (Kasumi-1, THP-I, and KG.l), the expression of SALL4A or SALL4B, or both, failed to be down-regulated. The results were calibrated against the expression of SALL4A or SALL4B in purified CD34+ cells.\n\n\nWEST\\21413050 1 3\n5\n6O77-000G29 \n\n [0046] Figures 3(a-e) show that SALL4B transgenic mice have an MDS-like/AML phenotype. Figure 3 (a) illustrates the generation of SALL4B transgenic mice: CMV/SALL4B transgenic construct and PCR analysis of transgenic line 507. (A) Schematic diagram of transgenic construct. The approximately 1.8-kb cDNA of SALL4B was subcloned into a pCEP4 vector, and the CMV/SALL4 construct was excited by digestion with Sail. (B) Tissue distribution of SALL4B in transgenic mice. The location of primers used for RT-PCR amplification is indicated by arrows in part A. A primer specific for human SALL4B at the C- terminus was used as a 5' primer, in combination with SV40-noncoding sequence-specific primers for RT-PCR of various tissues. Figure 3(b) shows the flow cytometric analysis of AML in SALL4B transgenic mice. AML cells were positive for CD45, c-kit, Gr-I, and Mac-1 ; negative for B220, CD3, and Terl 19. Figure 3(c) illustrates the comparison between bone marrow of SALL4B transgenic and control mice. SALL4B transgenic mouse bone marrow showed increased cellularity, myeloid population (Gr-I /Mac-1 double positive), immature population (c-kit positive), and apoptosis (Annexin V positive, PI negative), compared with control WT mice. Figure 3(d) shows that there are an increased number of immature cells and apoptosis in CFUs from SALL4B transgenic mice. On day 7 of culture, a greater number of immature cells (B, C, and D, red arrows) and apoptotic cells (B, C, and D, double red arrows) were observed in transgenic mouse CFUs than in control CFUs (A). Consistent with this morphologic observation, there was increased apoptosis (Annexin V positive, PI negative, E) and more CD34+ immature cells (F). Figure 3(e) illustrates the comparison between bone marrow CFUs of SALL4B transgenic and control mice. Percentage of different types of colonies found in CFU assays of SALL4B transgenic and control mice (A). CFUs from SALL4B transgenic mice compared with control mice showed a statistically significant increase in CFU-GM (B) (transgenic: 53.6±10.3, N=13 vs. WT: 38.U3.1, N=8; P=0.002) and decrease in BFU-E (transgenic: 7.8±3.8, N=13 vs. WT: 14.1±2.7, N=8; P= 0.001).\n\n\n[0047] Figures 4(a-c) demonstrate the interaction between SALL4 and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Figure 4(a) shows that both SALL4A and SALL4B can interact with β- catenin. Nuclear extracts (lysates) prepared from Cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with HA-SALL4A or HA-SALL4B. (A) Anti-HA antibody recognized both SALL4A (165 kDa) and SALL4B (95 kDa). (B) β-Catenin was detected in the lysates. (C) Immunoprecipitation was performed with the use of an HA affinity resin and detected with an anti-β-catenin antibody, β- Catenin was readily detected in both HA-SALL4A and HA-SALL4B pull-downs. Figure 4(b)\n\n\nWEST\\214130\n5\n0.1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n shows the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by both SALL4A and SALL4B. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 1.0 μg of either SALL4A or SALL4B plasmid and TOPflash reporter plasmid (Upstate USA, Chicago, IL). After 24-h stimulation with Wntl or the mock, luciferase activity was measured. Figure 4(c) illustrates a working hypothesis. SALL4 is expressed in human stem cells/progenitors but is absent in mature hematopoietic cells during normal hematopoiesis. Constitutive expression of SALL4 isoforms (failure to turn off S ALL4) results in blocked differentiation and constitutive renewal with aberrant expansion of the stem cell pool that lead to leukemic transformation (+, presence of SALL4 expression; -, absence of SALL4 expression).\n\n\n[0048] Figure 5 illustrates dose-dependent effect of SALL4B on the OCT4 promoter. 0.3 μg of OCT4-Luc construct (PMOct4) was cotransfected with 0.1 μg of renilla plasmid and increasing amounts (0-1.0 μg) of SALL4B or pcDNA3 vector control.\n\n\n[0049] Figure 6 demonstrates the effect of OCT4 on SALL gene family member promoters. Each (0.3 μg) SALL-Luc promoter construct (i.e., pSALLl, pSALL3, and pSALL4) was cotransfected with 0.9 μg of OCT4 or pcDNA3 vector control in HEK-293 cells. After 24 hr post- transfection, luciferase activity was evaluated for each group.\n\n\n[0050] Figure 7 shows the effect of SALL4 isoforms A and B on SALL4 promoter activity. 0.3 μg of SALL4-Luc was cotransfected with 0.1 μg of either SALL4A or SALL4B expressing plasmid in different cell lines (HEK-293 or COS-7); pcDNA3 vector was used as the control. Luciferase activity was normalized for renilla reporter activity. The values represent the mean ± s.e. of three experiments.\n\n\n[0051] Figure 8 demonstrates the dose dependent effect of SALL4A on SALL4 promoter activity. In HEK-293 cells, 0.3 μg of the SALL4-Luc was co-transfected with 0.1 μg of renilla plasmid and increasing ratios of the SALL4A construct and the control pcDNA3 vector. The Luciferase activity is normalized for the Renilla reporter activity.\n\n\n[0052] Figure 9 shows the effect of SALL4 on SALLl and SALL3 promoter activity. Each (0.3 μg) SALL-Luc promoter construct was transiently co-transfected with 0.9 μg of SALL4A plasmid or pcDNA3 vector (control) in HEK-293 cells.\n\n\n[0053] Figure 10 shows the effect of OCT4 on the S ALL4 promoter in the presence of excess SALL4A. 0.25 μg of SALL4-Luc construct (pSALL4) was transiently co-transfected with equal\n\n\nWESTO 1413O\n5\n0.1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n amounts (0.5 μg) of SALL4A and OCT4 plasmid in the HEK-293 cells. pcDNA3 was used as a control.\n\n\n[0054] Figure 11 shows the effect of OCT4 on other SALL member promoters in the presence of SALL4. HEK-293 cells seeded in a 24 well plate were transiently co-transfected with a different SALL member promoter reporter (pSALLl or pSALL3) and OCT4 plasmid and/or SALL4A construct. pcDNA3 was used as a control.\n\n\n[0055] Figure 12 shows the effect of self promoter interaction on promoter activity for other SALL protein family members. HEK-293 cells were seeded on a 24 well plate and transiently transfected or co-transfected with 0.3 μg SALLl -Luc reporter construct with various amounts of SALLl plasmid (0.45 and 0.9 μg) SIXl, previously found to activate SALLl promoter, was used as a positive control. Luciferase activity was normalized for renilla reporter activity.\n\n\n[0056] Figure 13 shows that SALL4 binds genes to Oct4 and Nanog as well as their networks. (A) Comparison with published data shows that SALL4 binds genes common to Oct4 and Nanog binding locations. (B) and (C) Western blots for SALL4, Oct4 and Nanog. These suggests that these three proteins work together to maintain pluripotency in ES cells.\n\n\n[0057] Figure 14 shows that SALL4 functions to maintain pluripotency. (A) Genes identified as pluripotency markers for each of the four cell lineages bound in the ChIP-chip. (B) Using real-time PCR we analyzed mRNA levels for various markers for pluripotency after SALL4 shutdown. Levels of mRNA increased for endoderm, ectoderm and trophectoderm markers, indicating that SALL4 represses differentiation into these cell lineages.\n\n\n[0058] Figure 15 shows that SALL4 binds to downstream targets of PRCl and PRC2. (A) To better illustrate the regulatory mechanisms of PRCl and PRC2 we compared the transcription factors bound by SALL4, Rnf2 and Suzl2. For example, Suzl2 only has two unique transcription factors and shares others with Rnf2, SALL4, or both SALL4 and Rnf2. (B) Representation of developmentally important genes bound by S ALL4. Included are multiple members of the HOX (homeobox protein), PAX (paired box), DLX (distal-less homeobox), SIX (sine oculis homeobox homologue), RBX (reproductive homeobox), H6 (H6 homeobox), OBX (oocyte specific homeobox), LHX (LIM homeobox), FBX (F-box), FOX (forkhead box), and TBX (T-box) families along with various other developmental genes.\n\n\nWEST\\21413050.1 356077-000029 \n\n [0059] Figure 16 shows that SALL4 regulates methylation events associated with H3K4 and H3K27.\n\n\n[0060] Figure 17 shows that SALL4 binds to signaling pathways vital to cell fate decisions. (A) SALL4 binds gene promoters belonging to various pathways and we suggest that it plays a regulatory role in these pathways. (B) Quantitative representation of pathways bound by SALL4. The values reflect genes bound directly in the pathway or as downstream targets of the pathway. (C) Using the Wnt/B-catenin signaling pathway, we show the effects of SALL4 shutdown on the canonical pathway (green is down-regulation, red is up-regulation of expression).\n\n\n[0061] Figure 18 demonstrates that expansion of HSC and HPC were correlated with disease progression in S ALL4B transgenic mice. Increased c-kit positive HSCs/HPCs in SALL4B transgenic mice are contrasted with WT control mice where c-kit positive cells are approximately 6.5+2.5% of the total bone marrow cells. This population was increased in pre-leukemic (MDS) SALL4B transgenic mice and became even more prominent in leukemic SALL4B bone marrow.\n\n\n[0062] Figure 19 shows LSCs in SALL4B transgenic mice. Whole bone marrows from SALL4B transgenic mice were sorted to HSCs, CMPs (common myeloid progenitors), GMPs (granulocyte/macrophage progenitors), and MEPs (megakryocyte/erythroid progenitors) and then transplanted into the primary NOD-SCID recipients. After the primary recipients developed leukemia, their bone marrow cells were sorted into HSCs, CMPs, GMPs, and MEPs and transplanted into secondary NOD-SCID recipients. Representative FACS-staining profiles of HSCs and HPCs from bone marrows of WT NOD-SCID mice, primary leukemic NOD-SCID recipients, and secondary leukemic NOD-SCID mice showed that GMP cells were substantially increased during leukemic transplantation. The increase of HSCs in leukemic SALL4B transgenic mice and leukemic NOD-SCID recipients were variable.\n\n\n[0063] Figure 20 shows caspase-3 activity, cell cycle and cellular DNA synthesis in SALL4 suppressed-NB4. A and D, NB4 transduced with control retrovirus. B and E, NB4 cells transduced with SALL4 siRNA retroviruses; C and F, restoration of Bmi-1 by ectopically expressing Bmi-1. Evidence showing that siRNA shutdown of SALL4 induces apoptosis in NB4 cells (A and B). SALL4 shutdown NB4 cells can be rescued from apoptosis (C). Monitor cell- cycle changes and cellular DNA synthesis in NB4 and SALL4 shutdown NB4 cells by both BrdU incorporation assay and FACS (3% background debris are excluded). SALL4 knockdown\n\n\nWESTV21413050.1 3\n5\n6077-0000\n2\n9 \n\n induces cell cycle arrest and increased DNA synthesis (D and E ). By ectopically expressing Bmi- 1, SALL4 shutdown cells can be rescued from cell cycle arrested and DNA synthesis (F). Two siRNA retroviral constructs that target different regions of the SALL4 are made, and their ability to reduce SALU mRNA in NB4 cells are confirmed by Q-RT-PCR. In both SALL4 siRNA constructs, down-regulation of SALL4 also significantly reduced Bmi-1 levels.\n\n\n[0064] Figure 21 demonstrates that treatment with 5-azacytidine (5AC) significantly suppresses SALL4 and its downstream target, Bmi-1, but increases expression of the tumor suppressor gene, pl6INK4a. After 48 hours of 5AC treatment, marked knockdown of Bmi-1 and SALL4 expression were observed in a dose-dependent manner of about 50-95% and 64-98%, respectively. Conversely, pl6\nINK4A\n mRNA expression significantly increased by 5-6 folds compared to the untreated control.\n\n\n[0065] Figure 22 shows dose-dependent activation of Bmi-1 promoter by SALL4 in HEK-293 cells. 0.25 μg of the Bmi-1 -Luc construct was co-transfected with 0.04 μg of Renilla Luciferase plasmid and increasing ratios of either the SALL4A or SALL4B expressing construct; pcDNA3 was used as the control. Data represent the mean of three individual experiments. HEK-293 cells, rather than 32D or HL60 cells, were used in these transfection experiments as these hematopoietic cells exhibit low transfection efficiency.\n\n\n[0066] Figure 23 shows the mapping of the SALL4 functional site within the Bmi-1 promoter region by a luciferase reporter gene assay. In HEK-293 cells, 0.3 μg of different length Bmi-1 - Luc constructs were co-transfected with 0.04μg of Renilla Luciferase plasmid and 0.9 μg of either SALL4A or SALL4B plasmid. The \nA\nP1254 and \nΔ\nP683 refer to Bmi-1 mutant promoter constructs, -1254 or -683, in which the -270 to -168 sequence was deleted. (A) Deletion constructs of the Bmi-1 promoter and their corresponding promoter activity stimulated by either SALL4A or SALL4B. (B) SALL4A and SALL4B stimulation of -1254 and -683 or \nA\nP1254 and P683 Bmi-1 promoter constructs.\n\n\n[0067] Figure 24 shows that SALL4 specifically binds to the endogenous mouse Bmi-1 promoter (-450 to 1+) using ChIP assays. (A) Schematic representation of the primer sets specific for Bmi- 1 promoter. (B) Chip assays were performed by using an antibody against HA (lane +) or preimmune sera (lane -); enriched chromatin was analyzed by PCR with primers as shown in A. (C) Relative enrichment of Bmi-1 promoter regions in 32D cells that were\n\n\nWEST\\214130\n5\n0.1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n transfected with SALL4 isoforms tagged with HA or the control, pcDNA3. Chip assays were performed using HA antibody. Amplicons were quantitated by Q-PCR. Endogenous SALL4 also bound to the human Bmi-1 promoter at the same position as seen in the human HEK-293 cells, leukemia cell lines, and NB4 using SALL4 antibodies.\n\n\n[0068] Figure 25 shows the effects of endogenous Bmi-1 expression levels. (A) siRNA mediated SALL4 suppression in leukemia cells: Three siRNA oligonucleotides, targeting the SALL4 gene at position 890, 1682, and 1705, respectively, were cloned into a pSUPER retrovirus vector; PT67 packaging cells were transfected and HL-60 cells were infected with the virus collected after 48 hr of infection. Stable infected cells were collected under G418 selection. Total RNA was extracted by Trizol, RT PCR was performed, and the relative amount of target gene niRNA was analyzed. The SALL4/GAPDH ratio in noninfected cells was set at 1; values are the mean of duplicate reactions. Bars indicate SD. (B) SALL4+/- heterozygous bone marrow cells showed decreased levels of Bmi-1 expression. Bone marrow cells from SALL4+/- and SALL4+/ f- mice were isolated. QRT PCR was performed to analyze expression levels of SALL4 and Bmi-1. Values are the mean of duplicate reactions. (C) Up-regulation of Bmi-1 in SALL4B transgenic mice associated with disease progression. RT-PCR analysis was performed on (1) total bone marrow cells from two WT control mice (lanes 1, 2) and two pre-leukemic transgenic mice (lanes 3, 4) and (2) leukemic bone marrow cells from two leukemic transgenic SALL4B mice (lanes 5, 6).\n\n\n[0069] Figure 26 demonstrates that mRNA expression of Bmi-1 and SALL4 in human AML blast samples showed a strong correlation between Bmi-1 and SALL4 expression. Twelve randomly selected blastic AML samples were analyzed using RT PCR to enhanced expression quantify relative mRNA expression of Bmi-1 and SALL4 genes. Ten out of 12 AML samples showed significant Bmi-1 gene amplification ranging from 1.10- to 22.32-fold increase relative to the averaged normal controls (Normal). Interestingly, the same 10 of 12 AML samples also showed elevated SALL4 gene expression amplification, ranging from a 3.93- to 653.03-fold increase relative to the averaged normal controls. The Log 10 scale represents the relative quantification of genes of interest. Using data for the 12 AML samples, we preformed a statistical analysis and determined the correlation coefficient to be 0.703 with a p-value of 0.0159.\n\n\nWEST\\214130\n5\n01 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n [0070] Figure 27 shows that SALL4 specifically binds to the endogenous mouse Bmi-1 promoter (-450 to 1+) resulting in histone 3 lysine 4 and lysine 79 methylation using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Enriched chromatin was analyzed by PCR with the primers shown in Figure 3 A. Figure 6 A and 6B are distributions of the histone 3 trimethylation levels of H3-K4 and H3-K79 on the Bmi-1 promoter regions, respectively, in 32D cells that were transfccted with SALL4A tagged with HA or control DNA, pcDNA3. ChIP assays were performed using histone H3-K4 trimethylation antibody (A) and histone H3-K79 methylation antibody (B). Amplicons were quantitated by Q-PCR. Experiments were repeated three times with similar results.\n\n\n[0071] Figure 28 shows that SALL4 expression is decreased during NTERA2 cell differentiation. A) Differentiation was induced in an embryonal canrcinoma cell line using retinoic acid. To determine the differentiation status of these cells, Q-RT-PCR was performed to analyze markers that represent lineage-specific cell differentiation. Retinoic acid induction (5 μM) of NTERA2 cells resulted in an up-regulation of a panel of ectoderm markers. In addition, some endodermal, mesodermal, and trophectodermal genes were also up-regulated. B) Following retinoic-acid-induced differentiation, SALL4 expression is significantly reduced in NTRA2 cells treated with different concentrations of retinoic acid when compared with untreated NTERA2 cells.\n\n\n[0072] Figure 29 shows the effects of endogenous Bmi-1 expression levels and cell differentiation by SALL4 knockdown are shown. A) Relative endogenous Bmi-1 and SALL4 expression levels after SALL4 knockdown are shown. Two siRNA oligonucleotides (#7410, #7412) targeting different regions of the SALL4 gene are transfected in PT67 packaging cells. NTERA2 cells are infected with the virus collected 48 hours post-transfection. Total RNA is extracted and Q-RT-PCR is performed to analyze the relative amount of target gene mRNA. The S ALL4/GAPDH ratio in noninfected cells is set at one. Values are the mean of duplicates, and bars indicate standard deviation. B, Effect of SALL4 knockdown on NTERA2 cell differentiation. Quantitative PCR analysis of stem-cell marker genes in NTERA2 cells after SALL4 siRNA (GCCGACCTATGTCAAGGTTGAAGTTCCTG (SEQ ID NO:33) and GATGCCTTGAAACAAGCCAAGCTACCTCA (SEQ ID NO:34) virus infection shows that no primitive germ-layer markers were detected.\n\n\nWEST\\21413050 1 3\n5\n6077-0()0029 \n\n [0073] Figure 30 shows representative FACS data of caspase-3 activity in NTERA2 and SALL4-deleted NTERA2 cells. Evidence showing that siRNA shutdown of SALL4 induces apoptosis in NTERA2 cells (A and B). By overexpressing Bmi-1, SALL4 shutdown cells can be rescued from apoptosis (C). However, overexpression of Bmi-1 has little effect on caspase-3 activity in WT NTERA2 cells (D).\n\n\n[0074] Figure 31 shows Monitored cell-cycle changes and cellular DNA synthesis in SALL4- depleted NTERA2 and NTERA2 cells by both BrdU incorporation assay and FACS. SALL4 knockdown induces cell cycle arrest and increased DNA synthesis (A and B). By ectopically expressing Bmi-1, SALL4 shutdown cells can be rescued from cell cycle arrested and DNA synthesis (C) but a control vector does not (data not shown), overexpression of Bmi-1 has little effect on cell cycle arrest and increased DNA synthesis in wild type NTERA2 cells (D).\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0075] Before the present composition, methods, and culturing methodologies are described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular compositions, methods, and experimental conditions described, as such compositions, methods, and conditions may vary.

All publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nWEST\\214130\n5\n0 1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n [0078] SALL4 is a member of a family Of C\n2\nH\n2\n zinc-finger transcription factors. SALL4 was originally cloned based on its homology to Drosophila splat. In Drosophila, sal is a homeotic gene and essential in the development of posterior head and anterior tail segments. In humans, an autosomal-dominant mutation is associated with Okihiro syndrome (also called Duane-radial ray syndrome), which causes defects in multiple organ systems. Mutations in the SALL4 gene severely hinder development in many animal models.\n\n\n[0079] SALL4 seems to regulate embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency through interaction with major regulatory proteins including Oct4 and Bmi-I.\n\n\n[0080] Bmi-1 is a member of the polycomb group (PcG) of proteins initially identified in Drosophila as a repressor of homeotic genes. In humans, the polycomb gene Bmi-1 plays an essential role in regulating adult, self-renewing, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Bmi-1 is expressed highly in purified HSCs, and its expression declines with differentiation. Knockout of the Bmi-1 gene in mice results in a progressive loss of all hematopoietic lineages. This loss results from the inability of the Bmi-1 (-/-) stem cells to self- renew. In addition, Bmi-1 (-/-) cells display altered expression of the cell cycle inhibitor genes pl6INK4a and pi 9ARF. The expression of Bmi-1 appears to be important in accumulation of leukemic cells. Interestingly, inhibiting self-renewal in tumor stem cells after deleting Bmi-1 can prevent leukemic recurrence. Recently, Bmi-1 expression has been used as an important marker for predicting the development of MDS and disease progression to AML.\n\n\n[0081] Knockdown OΪSALL4 expression using small interfering RNAs causes ESCs to differentiate into the trophoblast lineage, demonstrating that SALL4 must be expressed to maintain pluripotency. Further, it seems that SALL4 is necessary for the inner cell mass to differentiate into the epiblast and primitive endoderm during early embryogenesis. Expression of SALL4 protein can be correlated with stem and progenitor cell populations in various organ systems including bone marrow. The human Okihiro syndrome may result from premature depletion of different stem cell or progenitor cell pools depending on the genetic background.\n\n\n[0082] Embryonic stem cells have become the focus of scientific research due to their regenerative capacity and potential uses in disease therapies. Stem cells have been shown to give rise to all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) during embryogenesis emphasizing their pluripotent potential. Cellular machinery that governs ES cells is vital to their\n\n\nWEST\\21413050.1 356077-000029 \n\n function because it regulates the differentiation signals and pluripotency maintenance signals necessary for proper development.\n\n\n[0083] ES cells are derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of the developing embryo. During this critical time, ES cell pluripotency is regulated in part by Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog as well as through the two Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs): PRCl and PRC2. SALL4 may play a vital role in governing ES cells proliferation and pluripotency. For example, embryonic endoderm ES cells cannot be established from SALL4 deficient blastocyts. SALL4 is expressed by cells of the early embryo and germ cells, exhibiting a similar expression pattern to that of both Oct4 and Sox2. This suggests that SALL4 may be a regulator of a network of genes implicated in maintaining ES cell pluripotency.\n\n\n[0084] Homeobox and homeotic genes play important roles in normal development. Some homeobox genes, such as Hox and Pax, also function as oncogenes or as tumor suppressors in tumorigenesis or leukemogenesis. The important role of S ALL4, a homeotic gene and a transcriptional factor, in human development was recognized because heterozygous SALL4 mutations lead to Duane Radial Ray syndrome. In a related aspect, SALL4's oncogenic role in leukemogenesis is described herein.\n\n\n[0085] In one embodiment, the present disclosure identifies two SALL4 isoforms, SALL4A and SALL4B. In a related aspect, the disclosure provides an analysis of SALL4 nucleic acids and proteins as tools for diagnosing and treating patients having proliferation disorders such as hematologic malignancies and other tumors involving constitutive expression of SALL4 nucleic acid and protein. In a related aspect, SALL4 serves as a malignant stem cell marker for diagnosis and treatment of cancers.\n\n\n[0086] For example, during normal hematopoiesis, SALL4 isoforms are expressed in the CD34+ HSC/HPC population and rapidly turned off (SALL4B) or down-regulated (SALL4A) in normal human bone marrow and peripheral blood. In contrast, SALL4 is constitutively expressed in all AML samples (N=81) that were examined, and failed to turn off in human primary AML and myeloid leukemia cell lines. In a related aspect, the leukemogenic potential of constitutive expression of S ALL4 in vivo was directly tested via generation of S ALL4B transgenic mice. Such transgenic mice exhibit dysregulated hematopoiesis, much like that of human MDS, and exhibited AML that was transplantable. The MDS-like features in these SALL4B transgenic mice do not require cooperating mutations and are observed as early as 2\n\n\nWESTO 1413O\n5\nO 1 356077-000029 \n\n months of age. The ineffective hematopoiesis observed in these mice is characterized, as it is in human MDS, by hypercellular bone marrow and paradoxical peripheral blood cytopenias (neutropenia and anemia) and dysplasia, which are probably secondary to the increased apoptosis noted in the bone marrow. While not being bound to theory, a reason for the late onset of leukemia development in these transgenic mice may be the accumulation of additional genetic damage during the > 8 months of replicative stress. Late onset of disease may also be a consequence of S ALL4-induced genomic instability.\n\n\n[0087] Further, specific, recurrent chromosomal translocations characterize many leukemias, which can result from a breakdown in the normal process of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangement, causing inter-chromosomal translocations rather than normal intra- chromosomal rearrangement. The flow of genetic information from genes at chromosomal translocation breakpoints to proteins has several points which therapeutic reagents could intervene. Sequence specific binding elements that exploit zinc-finger binding protein domains can be used to create de novo sequence specific binding elements that could act as gene switches which can target chromosomal fusion junctions to turn off expression of aberrant gene fusion products.\n\n\n[0088] In one embodiment, S ALL4 can be used as a component of a fusion protein which targets chromosomal fusion junctions as a gene switch to modulate the expression of gene fusion products. Production of recombinant fusion protein is well known in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd PId.; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y. (1989).\n\n\n[0089] In one embodiment, SALL4 proteins and/or nucleic acids are detected for diagnosing subpopulations of lymphomas and leukemias or other types of cancers. In another embodiment, the detection of the SALL4 proteins and nucleic acids can be used to identify a subject, including, but not limited to, a human subject, at risk for developing/acquiring a proliferative disease.\n\n\n[0090] In a further embodiment, methods for identifying compounds which alter S ALL4 protein and nucleic acid levels are disclosed. In a related aspect, SALL4 can serve as a therapeutic target, where blocking SALL4 function can inhibit tumor development and progression.\n\n\nWEST\\214130\n50\n 1 356077-000029 \n\n [0091] In another aspect, investigation of the potential mechanism of SALL4 involvement in leukemogenesis demonstrates that both SALL4A and SALL4B interacted with β-catenin, an essential component of the Wnt signaling pathway involving self-renewal of HSCs. In addition, both are able to activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in a reporter gene assay, consistent with SALL family function in Drosophila and humans. Furthermore, similar to the situation with β- catenin, SALL4 expression in CML varied at different phases of the disease: SALL4 expression being absent in the chronic phase, became detectable in the accelerated phase only in immature blasts, and is strongly positive in the blast phase.\n\n\n[0092] On the basis of these studies, a working hypothesis is disclosed (e.g., see Fig. 4d). While not being bound to theory, constitutive expression of SALL4 in AML may enable leukemic blasts to gain stem cell properties, such as self-renewal and/or dedifferentiation, and thus become LSCs. This hypothetical model would parallel what is seen in the case of β-catenin. For example, in normal myelopoiesis, β-catenin is only activated in HSCs bearing a self-renewal property. In the blast phase of CML, β-catenin gains function by becoming activated in the GMPs, resulting in leukemic transformation.\n\n\n[0093] In another aspect, the oncogene SALL4 plays an important role in normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. SALL4B transgenic mice exhibit MDS-like phenotype with subsequently AML transformation that is transplantable. Few animal models are currently available for the study of human MDS. The SALL4B transgenic mice that were generated by the methods described herein provide a suitable animal model for understanding and treating human MDS and its subsequent transformation to AML. The interaction between SALL4 and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway not only provides a plausible mechanism for S ALL4 involvement in leukemogenesis but also advances the understanding of the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in CML blastic transformation.\n\n\n[0094] As disclosed herein, the identification of SALL4 isoforms and their constitutive expression in all human AML were examined. The direct impact of SALL4 expression in AML was tested in vivo. The disclosure demonstrates that constitutive expression of SALL4 in mice is sufficient to induce MDS-like symptoms and transformation to AML that is transplantable. The disclosure also demonstrates that SALL4 is able to bind β-catenin and activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

One then selects from the positive marker cells the stem cell of interest; this is performed by sorting cells by their expression of a known cell marker. Any marker that is known to be associated with the stem cells of interest may be used (see, e.g., Table 1).\n\n\n[0116] Any population of cells where stem cells are suspected of being found may be sorted according to the methods disclosed. In one aspect, cells are obtained from the bone marrow of a non-fetal animal, including, but not limited to, human cells. Fetal cells may also be used.\n\n\n[0117] Cell sorting may be by any method known in the art to sort cells, including sorting by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) (see, e.g., Baumgarth and Roederer, J Immunol Methods (2000) 243:77-97) and Magnetic bead cell sorting (MACS). The conventional MACS procedure is described by Miltenyi et al., \"High Gradient Magnetic Cell Separation with MACS,\" Cytometry 1 1 :231-238 (1990). To sort cells by MACS, one labels cells with magnetic beads and passes the cells through a paramagnetic separation column. The separation column is placed in a strong permanent magnet, thereby creating a magnetic field within the column. Cells that are magnetically labeled are trapped in the column; cells that are not pass through. One then\n\n\nWEST\\21413Q50.I 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n elutes the trapped cells from the column. In one embodiment, an antibody directed against SALL4 is used in cell sorting to isolate embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells and/or cancer stem cells. In another embodiment, an antibody directed against SALL4 is used in flow cytometry analysis to detect cells expressing SALL4, where such cells are associated with proliferative disease progression or neoplastic cell formation. In a related aspect, SALL4 is SALL4A or SALL4B.\n\n\n[0118] Myelodysplasia Syndrome (MDS) remains an incurable hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) malignancy that occurs most frequently among the elderly, with about 14,000 new cases each year in the USA. About 30-40 percent of MDS cases progress to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The incidence of MDS continues to increase as our population ages. Even though MDS and AML have been studied intensely, to date no satisfactory treatments have been developed, and the precise cellular or molecular events that induce progression of MDS to AML still remain poorly understood. Until very recently, no suitable cell line or animal model has been available for studying MDS and its progression to AML. Consequently, little progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of this disease thus the development of potential therapeutic treatments has been extremely slow and discouraging. An innovative approach is urgently needed if the research community is going to succeed in unraveling MDS and AML biology and creating a breakthrough in the development of new therapies for a persistent disease that has claimed many lives.\n\n\n[0119] Up to now, therapies for MDS and AML have focused on the leukemic blast cells because they are very abundant and clearly represent the most immediate problem for patients. However, an important fact centers on leukemic stem cells (LSCs) being quite different from most other leukemia cells (\"blast\" cells), and these LSCs constitute a rare subpopulation. While killing blast cells can provide short-term relief for MDS patients, LSCs, if not destroyed, will always re-grow causing the patient to relapse. It is imperative that the LSCs are destroyed in order to achieve durable cures for MDS disease. Unfortunately, standard drug regimens are not effective against the LSCs of either MDS or AML. To address this deficiency, a critical element in our proposed studies focuses on the development of new therapies that can specifically target LSCs. To this end, we have discovered that a reduction in the expression level of the SALL4 stem cell gene leads to apoptosis in LSCs and, importantly, spares normal stem cells.\n\n\nWEST\\21413050.1 3\n5\n6077-0Q0029 \n\n [0120] As disclosed herein, SALL4 is a critical stem gene that modulates stem cell pluripotency. For example, SALL4 knockdown results in massive apoptosis associated with reduction of Bmi-1. The SALL4-inducQd apoptosis can be fully rescued by restoring Bmi-1 to a normal level. While not being bound by theory, it seems that SALL4-induced apoptosis involves through regulation of Bmi-1.\n\n\n[0121] Further, the present invention demonstrates that overexpression of SALL4 in mice transforms HSCs/HPCs into LSCs with up-regulation of Bmi-1. Moreover, SALL4 is able to bind to the Bmi-1 promoter. In one embodiment, a method of modulating apoptosis and cell- cycle arrest is disclosed, where neoplastic cells are contacted with an agent that modulates expression of SALL4 and/or modulates the expression of Bmi-1. In one aspect, such sells are AML cells. In another aspect, the modulation reduces expression levels of SALL4 and/or Bmi-1 to induce cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. In a related aspect, such cells can be rescued by restoring Bmi-1 levels to substantially normal.\n\n\n[0122] In one aspect, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest may be achieved by targeting SALL4 or Bmi-1, or by targeting the combination. In another aspect, the induction of apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest may be accomplished by targeting SALL4 downstream targets. In one embodiment, a method of modulation of Bmi-1 via SALL4 targeting is disclosed, where such modulation results in apoptosis/cell cycle arrest in cancer stem cells and/or leukemic stem cells, thereby treating cancer in a subject in need thereof.\n\n\n[0123] As disclosed herein, SALL4 is an important survival and proliferative factor for NTERA2 cells. Given the observation that SALL4 is also present in other cancer stem cells, SALL4 may be an attractive target for the induction of cancer stem cells to undergo apoptosis.\n\n\n[0124] In one embodiment, SALL4B transgenic mice that exhibit MDS/AML associated with expansion of LSCs are disclosed. In one aspect, 5' azacytidine (5AC) or a combination with bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitors, is administered to SALL4B transgenic mice and changes are monitored in HSC and HPC subpopulations. In a related aspect, SALL4B transgenic mice will be treated with a variety of doses. Further, the data will be used to identify an optimal dose that maximizes inhibition of LSC expansion associated with therapeutic responses in SALL4B transgenic mice.\n\n\nWHST\\21413050 1 356077-000029 \n\n [0125] In another embodiment, 5AC is administered alone or a combination with bortezomib to evaluate their effects on the long-term self-renewal ability of LSCs in vitro using serial replating assays. In one aspect, the effects of apoptosis on LSCs are also examined by, for example, but not limited to, TUNEL assay and measurement of caspase-3 activity. In another aspect, the method determines changes in the expression levels of SΛLL4B; its downstream target, Bmi-1; and its pathways associated with cell growth and/or cell death in HSCs, such as pl6 and pi 9 in transgenic mice, during treatment of 5AC or bortezomib alone or together, by for example, Q-RT-PCR and western blotting. Peripheral blood samples may be obtained from SALL4B transgenic mice treated with 5AC or a bortezomib combination with age-matched, untreated control mice. Complete blood cell counts with automated differentials may be determined weekly. The differentials may be confirmed on smears. Further, latency of AML transformation may be compared between SALL4B mice treated with 5AC or a combination with bortezomib and untreated SALL4B mice. The onset of AML may be monitored by analysis of peripheral blood smears and bone marrow biopsies.\n\n\n[0126] In one embodiment, a method of treating a cancer of stem cell or progenitor cell origin is disclosed including administrating to a subject in need thereof a composition containing an agent which reduces the expression level of SALL4.\n\n\n[0127] In one aspect, the agent is an oligonucleotide sequence selected from SEQ ID NO:30, SEQ ID NO:31 ; or SEQ ID NO:32. In another aspect, the composition comprises a methylation inhibitor, including but not limited to, 5' azacytidine, 5' aza-2-deoxycytidine, 1-B-D- arabinofuranosyl-5-azacytosine, or dihydroxy-5-azacytidine. In a related aspect, the composition further comprises a proteasome inhibitor, including but not limited to, MG 132, PSI, lactacystin, epoxomicin, or bortezomib.\n\n\n[0128] Germ cell tumors (GCTs) are a diverse group of neoplasms that often present a challenge in clinical diagnoses and are most often diagnosed solely based on the histological presentation of the specimen. However, this can be difficult in many cases. Often a biopsy specimen is so small that accurate diagnosis of mixed GCTs is insufficient.\n\n\n[0129] Immunohistochemistry staining with SALL4 antibodies produces a specific and sensitive signal, he nuclear staining is consistent with the role of SALL4 as a transcription factor, and its lack of background staining provided distinct evidence of its expression in the positively stained cells. Our data show that SALL4 is expressed solely in cells with a pluripotent potential.\n\n\nWESTΛ21413050.1 356077-000029 \n\n Seminoma and embryonal carcinoma are clearly primitive cells with the potential to differentiate into many other cell lines. Immature teratomas and yolk sac tumors are called tissue stem cells because they have a pluripotent potential but can only differentiate further into cells of a specific tissue. The mature teratomas do not express SALL4, which is consistent with the fact that they do not have the ability to differentiate any further.\n\n\n[0130] As disclosed, the staining of SALL4 in spermatogenesis shows that SALL4 is strongly expressed in germ cells but not in any other cells of the seminiferous tubules. Similarly, SALL4 is expressed in an undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cell line, but after induced differentiation, its expression is down-regulated. SALL4 is also not expressed in a significant number of cells derived from normal of cancerous epithelial tissues . For example, the tissue types represented in a tissue array may contain less than 2% of cells that stain positive for SALL4. Thus, cells that stain positive for SALL4 in the arrays are indicative of tissue stem cells.\n\n\n[0131] Further, the staining of the seminiferous tubules with the SALL4 antibody is unique in that only the germ cells of the tubule stained positive for SALL4.

In a related aspect, the modulating is down- regulating.\n\n\n[0153] Infantile hemangeomas are very common in newborn and young children. Almost 10% of the Caucasian population have hemangiomas. Sixty percent of the hemangiomas occur on the head and neck and most of the hemangiomas go through a proliferative phase of growth, expanding rapidly after birth and involuting as the child gets older. Some of these hemangiomas may become large enough that they destroy head and neck structures. Many are severely disfiguring and can cause children to have psychosocial stigmata that can prevent normal maturation.\n\n\n[0154] In one embodiment, antibody directed against human SALL4 is used to characterize subsets of stem cells in hemangiomas, where such antibodies bind to SALL4 expressing cells, which cells are putative pluripotent stem cells. In a related aspect, 5 to 10% of the cells comprising hemangiomas bind to such SALL4 directed antibodies. Further, diagnosis and monitoring of hemangioma involution can be determined by as decrease in SALL4 binding by such antibodies. In one aspect, the monitoring may include, but is not limited to, flow cytometry and/or examination of tissue sections of cells immunohistochemically stained with anti-SALL4.\n\n\n[0155] In another embodiment, non-surgical treatment for infantile hemangiomas is disclosed, where an agent which reduces SALL4 expression is administered to a subject in need thereof in an amount sufficient to cause induction of involution of the hemangiomas in the subject.\n\n\n[0156] In another embodiment, a transgenic animal is disclosed. In a general aspect, a transgenic animal is produced by the introduction of a foreign gene in a manner that permits the expression of the transgene. Methods for producing transgenic animals are generally described by Wagner and Hoppe (U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,191; which is incorporated herein by reference), Brinster et al. (1985); which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) and in \"Manipulating the Mouse Embryo; A Laboratory Manual\" 2nd edition (eds., Hogan, Beddington,\n\n\nWEST\\2141\n305\n0.1 356077-000029 \n\n Costantimi and Long, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1994); which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).\n\n\n[0157] Typically, a gene is transferred by microinjection into a fertilized egg. The microinjected eggs are implanted into a host female, and the progeny are screened for the expression of the transgene. Transgenic animals may be produced from the fertilized eggs from a number of animals including, but not limited to reptiles, amphibians, birds, mammals, and fish.\n\n\n[0158] DNA clones for microinjection can be prepared by any means known in the art. For example, DNA clones for microinjection can be cleaved with enzymes appropriate for removing the bacterial plasmid sequences, and the DNA fragments electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels in TBE buffer, using standard techniques. The DNA bands are visualized by staining with ethidium bromide, and the band containing the expression sequences is excised. The excised band is then placed in dialysis bags containing 0.3 M sodium acetate, pH 7.0. DNA is electroeluted into the dialysis bags, extracted with a 1:1 phenol: chloroform solution and precipitated by two volumes of ethanol. The DNA is redissolved in 1 ml of low salt buffer (0.2 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 1 mM EDTA) and purified on an Elutip-D™ column. The column is first primed with 3 ml of high salt buffer (1 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 1 mM EDTA) followed by washing with 5 ml of low salt buffer. The DNA solutions are passed through the column three times to bind DNA to the column matrix. After one wash with 3 ml of low salt buffer, the DNA is eluted with 0.4 ml high salt buffer and precipitated by two volumes of ethanol. DNA concentrations are measured by absorption at 260 nm in a UV spectrophotometer.\n\n\n[0159] The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound capable of treating a disorder in an amount effective therefore, and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or diluent.

The present compounds may, for example, be administered in a form suitable for immediate release or extended release. Immediate release or extended release may be achieved by the use of suitable pharmaceutical compositions comprising the present compounds, or, particularly in the case of extended release, by the use of devices such as subcutaneous implants or osmotic pumps. The present compounds may also be administered liposomally.\n\n\n[0162] In addition to primates, such as humans, a variety of other mammals can be treated according to the method of the present invention. For instance, mammals including, but not limited to, cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rats or other bovine, ovine, equine, canine, feline, rodent or murine species can be treated. However, the method can also be practiced in other species, such as avian species (e.g., chickens).\n\n\n[0163] The subjects treated in the above methods, in which cells targeted for modulation is desired, are mammals, including, but not limited to, cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rats or other bovine, ovine, equine, canine, feline, rodent or murine species, and preferably a human being, male or female.\n\n\nWESTU H 13050 1 356077-000029 \n\n [0164] The term \"therapeutically effective amount\" means the amount of the subject compound that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.\n\n\n[0165] The term \"composition,\" as used herein, is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. By \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.\n\n\n[0166] The terms \"administration of and or \"administering a\" compound should be understood to mean providing a compound of the invention to the individual in need of treatment.\n\n\n[0167] The pharmaceutical compositions for the administration of the compounds of this invention may conveniently be presented in dosage unit form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition the active object compound is included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect upon the process or condition of diseases.\n\n\n[0168] The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs.\n\n\n[0169] Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These\n\n\nWbST\\21413050 1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.\n\n\n[0170] Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules where the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules where the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.\n\n\n[0171] Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxy-propyhnethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.\n\n\n[0172] Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring\n\n\nWEST\\2141\n3\n050.1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.\n\n\n[0173] Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.\n\n\n[0174] Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.\n\n\n[0175] The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n[0176] The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n[0177] For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compounds of the present invention are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouthwashes and gargles).\n\n\n[0178] Nucleic acid according to the present disclosure, encoding a polypeptide or peptide able to interfere with SALL4 may be used in methods of gene therapy, for instance in treatment\n\n\nWEST\\21413050.1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n of individuals with the aim of preventing or curing (wholly or partially) a tumor e.g., in cancer, or other disorder involving loss of proper regulation of the cell-cycle and/or cell growth, or other disorder in which specific cell death is desirable.\n\n\n[0179] Vectors such as viral vectors have been used in the art to introduce nucleic acid into a wide variety of different target cells. Typically the vectors are exposed to the target cells so that transfection can take place in a sufficient proportion of the cells to provide a useful therapeutic or prophylactic effect from the expression of the desired polypeptide. The transfected nucleic acid may be permanently incorporated into the genome of each of the targeted tumour cells, providing long lasting effect, or alternatively the treatment may have to be repeated periodically.\n\n\n[0180] A variety of vectors, both viral vectors and plasmid vectors, are known in the art, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,479 and WO 93/07282. In particular, a number of viruses have been used as gene transfer vectors, including papovaviruses, such as SV40, vaccinia virus, herpesviruses, including HSV and EBV, and retroviruses. Many gene therapy protocols in the art have used disabled murine retroviruses.\n\n\n[0181] As an alternative to the use of viral vectors other known methods of introducing nucleic acid into cells includes electroporation, calcium phosphate co-precipitation, mechanical techniques such as microinjection, ballistic methods, transfer mediated by liposomes, and direct DNA uptake and receptor-mediated DNA transfer.\n\n\n[0182] Receptor-mediated gene transfer, in which the nucleic acid is linked to a protein ligand via polylysine, with the ligand being specific for a receptor present on the surface of the target cells, is an example of a technique for specifically targeting nucleic acid to particular cells.\n\n\n[0183] In the treatment of a subject where cells are targeted for modulation, an appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.01 to 500 mg per kg patient body weight per day which can be administered in single or multiple doses. Preferably, the dosage level will be about 0.1 to about 250 mg/kg per day; more preferably about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg per day. A suitable dosage level may be about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day, or about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg per day. Within this range the dosage may be 0.05 to 0.5, 0.5 to 5 or 5 to 50 mg/kg per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, particularly 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0. 20.0, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0, 100.0, 150.0, 200.0, 250.0, 300.0, 400.0, 500.0, 600.0, 750.0, 800.0,\n\n\nWEST\\21413050.1 356077-000029 \n\n900.0, and 1000.0 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per day.\n\n\n[0184] It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy.\n\n\n[0185] The following examples are intended to illustrate but not limit the invention.\n\n\nEXAMPLES Methods\n\n\nMolecular cloning\n\n\n[0186] Plasmid construction and DNA sequencing were performed in accordance with standard procedures. For cloning of SALL4 isoforms, PCR primers were designed, based on the genomic clone RP5-1112F19 (SEQ ID NO: 25) (GenBank accession no. AL034420). SALL4 isoforms were cloned with the use of the Marathon-Ready cDNA library derived from human fetal kidney (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), according to the supplier's protocol. The amplified PCR products were cloned into a TA Cloning vector (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), and the nucleotide sequences were determined by DNA sequencing. The GAL4-SALL4B construct was generated by PCR with the use of a 5' primer and a 3' primer with a restriction enzyme site, BamHI, at each end:\n\n\n5' primer: 5'-TTATCAGGATCCTGGTCGAGGCGCAAGCAGGCGAAACCC-S' (SEQ ID NO: 7); and\n\n\n3' primer: 5'-CCAGGATCCTTAGCTGACCGCCAATCTTGTTTC-S' (SEQ ID NO: 8).\n\n\n[0187] The GAL4-SALL4B construct was expected to encode 93 amino acids of minimal GAL4 DNA-binding domain and the full length of SALL4B, except for the first amino acid, methionine.\n\n\nWEST\\2141\n3\n0\n50\n.l 3S6077-000029 \n\n Determination of alternative splicing patterns in different tissues\n\n\n[0188] Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was used to evaluate mRNA expression patterns of SALL4 in adult tissues. A panel of eight normalized first-strand cDNA preparations, derived from different adult tissues, was purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech. PCR amplification was performed in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 5 μl of cDNA, 10 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.2 mM dNTPs, and 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). After an initial denaturation at 94°C for 10 min, amplification was performed for 30 cycles under the following conditions: 30-sec denaturation at 94°C, 30-sec annealing at 55°C, and 30-sec extension at 72°C. The last cycle was followed by a final 7-min extension at 72°C.\n\n\n[0189] Amplification of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was used to control for template concentration loading. The primer pairs selected specifically for SALL4 isoforms were the following:\n\n\n[0190] SALL4A primers (sense primer: 5'-ATTGGCACCGGCAGTTACCACC (SEQ ID NO: 9); antisense primer: 5'-AGTACTCGTGGGCATATTGTC-S' (SEQ ID NO: 10)) and\n\n\n[0191] 2) SALL4B primers (sense primer: 5'-ATGTCGAGGCGCAAGCAGGCGAAAC-S' (SEQ ID NO: 11); antisense primer: 5'-TTAGCTGACCGCAATCTTGTTTTCT-S' (SEQ ID NO: 12)).\n\n\n[0192] PCR products were electrophoretically separated on 1% agarose gel. DNA sequencing was also used to confirm amplification products.\n\n\nAntibody generation\n\n\n[0193] The peptide MSRRKQ AKPQHIN (SEQ ID NO: 13) of human SALL4 was chosen for its potential antigenicity (amino acids 1-13) and used to prepare an antipeptide antibody. This region is also identical to that of mouse SALL4 so that the generated antibody could be expected to cross-react with mouse SALL4. S ALL4 antipeptide antibody was produced in rabbits in collaboration with Lampire Biological Laboratories Inc. (Pipersville, PA).\n\n\nWEST\\214130\n5\n0.1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n Gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis\n\n\n[0194] Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out in SDS 10% w/v polyacrylamide slab gels according to Laemmli, and the proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting of rabbit immune serum with the SALL4 antipeptide antibody (1:100) was performed with an electrochemiluminescenee detection system as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).\n\n\nLeukemia and normal tissues\n\n\n[0195] Leukemia and normal samples, either in paraffin blocks or frozen in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), were collected from the files of The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, between 1998 and 2004 under approved Institutional Review Board protocols. The diagnosis of all tumors was based on morphologic and immunophenotypic criteria according to the FAB Classification for Hematopoietic Neoplasms. CD34+ fresh cells were purchased from Cambrex.\n\n\nReal-time quantitative RT-PCR\n\n\n[0196] TaqMan 5' nuclease assay was used (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in these studies. Total RNA from purified CD34+ HSCs/HPCs from normal bone marrow and peripheral blood, 15 AML samples, and three leukemia cell lines was isolated with the RNeasy Mini Kit and digested with DNase I (Qiagen). RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed in 20 μL with the use of Superscript II reverse transcriptase and a poly(dT)12-18 primer (Invitrogen). After the addition of 80 μL of water and mixing, 5-μL aliquots were used for each TaqMan reaction. TaqMan primers and probes were designed with the use of Primer Express software version 1.5 (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR for SALL4 and GAPDH was performed with the TaqMan PCR core reagent kit (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems). The PCR reaction mixture contained 3.5 mM MgCl\n2\n; 0.2 mM each of deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP), deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP), and deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP); 0.4 mM deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP); 0.5 μM forward primer; 0.5 μM reverse primer; 0.1 μM TaqMan probe; 0.25 U uracil DNA glycosylase; and 0.625 U AmpliTaq Gold polymerase in 1 x TaqMan PCR buffer. cDNA (5 μL) was added to the PCR mix, and the final volume of the PCR reaction was 25 μL. All samples were run in duplicate. GAPDH was used as an endogenous control. Thermal cycler conditions were 50°C for 2 min,\n\n\nWESTY21413050.1 356077-000029 \n\n95°C for 10 min, and 45 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec and 60\n0\nC for 1 min. Data were analyzed with the use of Sequence Detection System software version 1.6.3 (Applied Biosystems). Results were obtained as threshold cycle (Ct) values. The software determines a threshold line on the basis of the baseline fluorescent signal, and the data point that meets the threshold is given as the Ct value. The Ct value is inversely proportional to the starting number of template copies. AU measurements were performed in duplicate. TaqMan sequences include the following:\n\n\nGAPDH forward primer: (5'-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-S' (SEQ ID NO: 14)) and reverse primer: (5'-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-S' (SEQ ID NO: 15)), TaqMan probe: (5'-CAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAGCC-S' (SEQ ID NO: 16)), and SALL4 forward primer: (5'- CCTCCTAATGAGAGTATCTGGGTGAT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 17)) and reverse primer: (5'- TTAAAAC ATACAGCGCATGATTGG-S' (SEQ ID NO: 18)).\n\n\nDesign and construction of tissue arrays\n\n\n[0197] Tissue arrays that included triplicate tumor cores from leukemia specimens were sectioned (5 μm thick). A manual tissue arrayer (Beecher Instruments, Silver Spring, MD) was used to construct the tissue arrays.\n\n\nImniunohistochemistry\n\n\n[0198] Immunohistochemical staining was performed according to standard techniques. Briefly, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, 4-μm-thick tissue sections were deparafinized and hydrated. Heat-induced epitopes were retrieved with a Tris buffer (pH 9.9; Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) and a rapid microwave histoprocessor. After incubation at 100°C for 10 min, slides were washed in running tap water for 5 min and then with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) for 5 min. Tissue sections were then incubated with anit-SALL4 antibody (1 :200) for 5 h in a humidified chamber at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, tissue sections were incubated with antimouse immunoglobulin G and peroxidase for 30 min at room temperature.\n\n\n[0199] After three washes with PBS, tissue sections were incubated with 3,3'- diaminobenzidine/H\n2\nθ\n2\n (Dako) for color development; hematoxylin was used to counterstain the sections. Neoplastic cells were considered to be positive for SALL4 when they showed definitive nuclear staining.\n\n\nWESTV214130S0.1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n Generation of transgenic mice\n\n\n[0200] SALL4B cDNA, corresponding to the entire coding region, was subcloned into a pCEP4 vector (IntroGene; now Crucell, Leiden, The Netherlands) to create the CMV/SALL4B construct for the transgenic experiments. Subsequent digestion with Sail, which does not cut within the SALL4B cDNA, released a linear fragment containing only the CMV promoter, the SALL4 cDNA coding region, the SV40 intron, and polyadenylation signal without additional vector sequences.\n\n\n[0201] Transgenic mice were generated via pronuclear injection performed in the transgenic mouse facility at Yale University. Identification of SALL4B founder mice and transmission of the transgene was determined by PCR analyses. The PCR primers used for the genotyping span the junction of the 5' SALL4B cDNA to the CMV promoter (sense primer: 5'-CAGAGATGC TGAAGAACTCCGCAC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 19); antisense primer: 5'- AGCAGAGCTCGTTTAGTGAACCG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 20)).\n\n\nHematologic analysis\n\n\n[0202] Complete blood cell counts with automated differentials were determined with a Mascot Hemavet cell counter (CDC Technologies, Oxford, CT). For progenitor assays, 1.5 \nχ\n10\n4\n bone marrow cells were plated in duplicate 1.25-ml methylcellulose cultures supplemented with recombinant mouse interleukin-3 (IL-3) (10 ng/ml), IL-6 (10 ng/ml), stem cell factor (SCF) (50 ng/ml), and erythropoietin (3 U/ml) (M3434, StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Colonies were recorded between days 7 and 14 (CFU-G, CFU-GM, CFU- M, CFU-GEMM, and BFU-E). Peripheral blood, bone marrow smears, and cytospin from pooled CFU cells were stained with Wright-Giemsa stain.\n\n\nFlow cytometric analysis\n\n\n[0203] Cells were stained with directly conjugated antibodies to Gr-I, Mac-1, B220, Terl 19, c-kit, CD34, CD45, CD41, CD19, CD5, CD3, CD4, CD8, propidium iodide (PI) or Annexin V (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Ten thousand scatter-gated red cells were acquired on a FACScan and analyzed with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences Clontech).\n\n\n[0204] Proliferating cells were first treated with and without IS3 295 for up to 48 hours. A portion of the cells were harvested to incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (Pharmingen)\n\n\nWEST\\21413\n05\n0.1 3\n5\n6077-0000\n2\n9 \n\n following the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by flow cytometry. Harvested cells also were analyzed for apoptosis via detection by TUNEL assay using a Roche Applied Science apoptosis detection system (Fluorescein) according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\n\n\n[0205] Student's t-Test was used for all the statistical analysis, assuming normal two-tailed distribution and unequal variance. Further, treatment with 5AC or a bortezomib combination that will affect SALL4B HSCs and HPCs will be determined over various doses, hi addition, identifying an optimal dose will be carried out. The primary endpoint of such a study is post-treatment percentage of SALL4B HSCs/HPCs and apoptotic cells as compared to normal HSCs/HPCs within these populations after the animals are sacrificed. Other endpoints include determining the long-term self-renewal ability of LSCs in vitro and the expression of Bmi-1 after exposure to 5AC and a combination of 5AC with bortezomib.\n\n\nCell culture and transfection\n\n\n[0206] All cell cultures were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO\n2\n. HEK-293 (ATCC: CRL- 11268) cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (fetal bovine serum) and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). The HL60 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and P/S. A murine hemopoietic multipotential cell line, 32D (ATCC: CRL-1821), was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, P/S, and mouse leukemia inhibitory factor (mLIF; 1 x 103 U/ml, Chemicon, Pittsburgh, PA). Transfection of plasmids into HEK-293, mouse 32D cells, and HL60 cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were plated in 24- well plates at a density of ~l\nχ\nlθ\n5\n cells/well. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Plasmid DNA for transient transfection was prepared with the Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit (Valencia, CA).\n\n\nβ-Galactosidase and luciferase assays.\n\n\n[0207] The cells were extracted with 100 μl of luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega Corp., Madison Wi) 24 h after transfection. The β-galactosidase assay, performed with 10 μl of cell extract, used the β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System (Promega) and the standard assay protocol provided by the manufacturer (except that 1 M Tris base was used as stopping buffer, instead of sodium carbonate). For the luciferase assay (Promega), 5 μl of extract were used in\n\n\nWESTΛ21413050 1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. After subtraction of the background, luciferase activity (arbitrary units) was normalized to β-galactosidase activity (arbitrary units) for each sample.\n\n\nPromoter reporter assays\n\n\n[0208] In general, 0.25-0.3 μg of an OCT4-Luc construct (PMOct4) comprising an OCT4 promoter (SEQ ID NO:26) or SALL-Luc construct containing a SALL family protein (i.e., SALLl, SALL3, SALL4A, or SALL4B) promoter (i.e., SEQ ID NO:27, SEQ ID NO:28, and SEQ ID NO:29, respectively, where SALL4A and SALL4B share the same promoter) was cotransfected with between 0.1 μg and 0.12 μg of renilla plasmid and/or various amounts (0-1.0 μg) of plasmid expressing SALL family proteins or OCT4 protein in HEK-293 or COS-7 cells. Typically, pcDNA3 vector was used as the control. Transfected cells were then monitored for luciferase activity 24 hour s post-transfection.\n\n\nHuman samples\n\n\n[0209] Classic seminomas, embryonal carcinomas, yolk sac tumors, mature teratomas, immature teratomas, and choriocarcinomas were obtained from as paraffin-embedded sections and used in immunohistochemistry staining. A tissue microarray of non-GCTs was purchased from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\n\nCell culture\n\n\n[0210] Human EC cell line NTERA2.cl.Dl (ATCC#CRL-1973) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum). Cells were induced to differentiate by treatment with different amounts of retinoic acid (Sigma). Phoenix packaging cells (ATCC: #SD-3443) are cultured by means well known in the art.\n\n\nVirus production and SALL4 knockdown\n\n\n[0211] Two siRNA oligonucleotides (#7410, #7412; Origen, Rockville, MD) that targeted different regions of the SALL4 gene were transfected into Phoenix packaging cells using Lipofectamin 2000. Shed virus was harvested. NTERA2 cells were infected with the virus collected 48 hours post-transfection. Stable SALL4 knockdown NTERA2 clones were obtained\n\n\nWEST\\214130\n5\n0.1 356077-000029 \n\n under puromycin (1.2ug/ml) selection after 7 days. The pcDNA construct expressing Bmi-1 was used for transfection into the NTERA2 cell line.\n\n\nBmi-1 promoter constructs and site-directed mutagenesis\n\n\n[0212] The 5'-flanking region of Bmi-1 was amplified with primers (5\n1\n primer: 5'-CAT CCT CGA GGG CTG TTG ACA TCT GCA GAG ACT G -3'; 3' primer: TCG TAG ATC TCA TTT CTG CTT GAT AAA AGA TCC TGG -3') to generate a fragment from nucleotide (Nt) -1 to Nt- 2102 upstream of the starting codon ATG with Xhol and BgIII sites at each end respectively. Mouse genomic DNA isolated from ESCs was used as a template. The amplified PCR (polymerase chain reaction) fragment was cloned into the promoterless pGL3 -basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate plasmid Bmi-1 (P2102) (i.e. Nt-I to -2102, see Fig. l). Promoter fusion reporter fragments from Nt-I to -1254, -683, -270 and -168 (P1254, P683, P270, and P168) were created in the same manner as Bmi-1. The deletion mutant of the Bmi-1 -Luc promoter constructs P683 and P 1254, which lack the -168-270 sequence, was generated using a QuikChange II mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\n\nsiRNA constructs\n\n\n[0213J For down regulation of S ALL4, 3 different sets of 60-bp oligonucleotides targeting different regions of the human SALL4 sequence were synthesized. These fragments were cloned into the Hindlll and BgIII sites of pSuper-retro-puro (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) to generate pSuper-retro/SALL4-l siRNA constructs, designated:\n\n\nSEQ ID NO:30 (5'-gatcccccaacatcccttctgccaccttcaagagaggtggcagaagggatgttgtttttc-3'), SEQ ID NO:31 (5'-gatcccccaccactgatcccaacgaattcaagagattcgttgggatcagtggtgtttttc-3'), and SEQ ID NO:32 (5'-gatcccctcatttgccaccgagtcttttcaagagaaagactcggtggcaaatgatttttc-3'). Generation of retrovirus\n\n\n[0214] The Phoenix packaging cells (ATCC: SD-3443) were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS in 5% CO\n2\n at 37°C. Recombinant retroviruses were produced using the Phoenix packaging cell line that was transfected with the pSuper construct containing the control RNAi sequence or sequence directed against SALL4. The viral supernatant was collected 48 hours after transfection and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter.\n\n\nWEST\\214130\n50\n.l 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n Bmi-1 promoter assays\n\n\n[0215] Bmi-1 promoter luciferase assays were performed with the Dual-Lucif erase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison WI). Twenty-four hours after transfection, HEK-293 cells were extracted with the use of a passive lysis buffer; a 20-μl aliquot was used for luminescence measurements with a luminometer. The data are represented as the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activity (Fluc/Rluc). These experiments were performed in duplicate.\n\n\nChIP assay\n\n\n[0216] HEK-293 32D cells (1 x 10\n6\n cells/well in 6-well plates), with or without transient transfection, were processed using a ChIP Assay Kit (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) following the manufacture's protocol. Briefly, cells were cross-linked by adding formaldehyde (27 μl of 37% formaldehyde/ml) and incubated for 10 min. Then, chromatin was sonicated to an average size of approximately 500 bp and immunoprecipitated with SALL4 antibodies, preimmune serum, or anti-HA (hemagglutination) antibody. Antibodies for histone modifications, histone H3 trimethy K4 and histone H3 dimethy K79, were purchased from Abeam (Cambridge, MA). Histone-DNA crosslinks were reversed by heating at 65\n0\nC followed by digestion with proteinase K (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). DNA was recovered by using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and then used for PCR or QRT-PCR (quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction).\n\n\nHuman leukemia samples and SALL4 knockout\n\n\n[0217] Leukemia and normal samples frozen in Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were collected from the files of The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, under approved Institutional Review Board protocols. The diagnosis of all tumors was based on morphologic and immunophenotypic criteria according to the FAB Classification for Hematopoietic Neoplasms. The generation of SALL4 knockout mice was described (8).\n\n\nCell culture\n\n\n[0218] W4 mouse ESCs (kindly provided by the Gene Targeting Core Facility, University of Iowa) either on feeders or in feeder-free conditions were cultured as described previously. For SaIU+/- deficient ESCs, G418 was added in the media at a concentration of 125ug/ml.\n\n\nWES1Λ2 I4I3050 1 356077-000029 \n\n ChIP-chip Assays\n\n\n[0219] A complete protocol was provided by NimbleGen Systems Inc (Madison, WI). In brief, cells were grown, cross-linked with formaldehyde and sheared by sonication. The anti- SALL4 antibody and rabbit serum (ref.) were used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP). CHIP -purified DNA was blunt-ended, ligated to linkers and subjected to low-cycle PCR amplification. Promoter tiling arrays (RefSeq array) were produced by NimbleGen. The RefSeq mouse promoter array design is a single array containing 2.7kb of each promoter region (from build MM5). The promoter region is covered by 50-75 mer probes at roughly lOObp spacing dependent on the sequence composition of the region. The arrays were hybridized, and the data were extracted according to NimbleGen standard procedures.\n\n\n[0220] Confirmation of the predicted binding sites was performed using Quantitative realtime PCR analysis of the amplicons that were applied to the arrays.\n\n\nMieroarray design and analysis\n\n\n[0221] A custom mieroarray was manufactured by NimbleGgen (Madison, WI) using maskless array synthesis. The mouse genes on this design (n = 42558) were selected from the Mus musculus entries in the RefSeq collection. Each gene was compared with all others using the BLAST program to remove redundancies. Ten probe pairs for each target were selected from the 3' 1 kb of each target. Probes were spaced evenly over the length of the target region (Sl kb), so that the exact spacing depended on the length of the target sequence. Each probe was 24 nucleotides in length. For each perfect match probe there was also a mismatch probe, which differed by a single nucleotide.\n\n\n[0222] Labeled cDNA was hybridized to the oligonucleotide probes on the mieroarray. After washing, arrays were stained with streptavidin-Cy3 conjugate (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, New Jersey), followed by washing and a blow dry step. Slides were scanned using a GenePix 4000B mieroarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, California, USA), and the feature intensities extracted from the TIF files were calculated by the scanner software using a proprietary application developed at NimbleGen (Madison, Wisconsin, USA). This application calculates mean signal intensities for the pixels that define each feature (3 x 3 grid of pixels). The intensities for each gene are calculated by taking the mean of the intensities for the perfect match probes specific to each target minus the mean of the intensity of the mismatch probes. Probes that\n\n\nWESTV21413QS0 1 3\n5\n6077-00CI029 \n\n differed from the mean for the set by more than 3 SD were removed from the set and the mean recalculated. Average differences (recalculated mean) were used for subsequent analysis. Data analysis was performed using PANTHER and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.\n\n\nImmunocoprecipitation and western blotting\n\n\n[0223] For Oct4/SALL4 and Nanog/SALL4 interactions, plasmid pcDNA3/S ALL4-HΛ was transfected into W4 ES cells to express SALL4-HA fusion protein. Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) was used based on provided instructions. After 36 hours, cells were collected and treated with CelLytic M Cell Lysis Reagent (Sigma). The immunocoprecipitation were performed following the Catch and Release v2.0 Kit (Upstate) recommendations. Initially, W4 lysates were incubated with the anti-HA antibody (Bethyl Laboratories Inc.) or IgG at 25°C for 40 minutes, protein bound to the beads was then washed and eluted with denaturing elution buffer containing 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol. Western blot was performed as described (ref.). The membrane was incubated with Oct-3/4 (H- 134), Nanog (M- 149) (both from Santa Cruz) or SALL4 antibodies at a 1 :300 dilution at 4\n0\nC overnight. Detection was done by using the SuperSignal West Pico solutions (Pierce).\n\n\nGeneration of a S ALL4 floxed allele and S ALL4+/- deficient ES cells\n\n\n[0224] The SALL4-flox vector was constructed by incorporating the 5' Notl-Sall 2 kb fragment, the T BamlflΛoxp-Pacl-Kpnl 3.2 kb fragment and the PacVKprύ. 3.4 kb fragment into a vector that contained pGK-Neo flanked by FRT and loxP sequences. LoxP sequences were placed so that exon 2 was excised upon Cre treatment, resulting in disruption of 6 zinc-finger motifs. These ES cells were infected with Ad-CMV-Cre or Ad-CMV-GFP (#1045 and #1060 Vector BioLabs) following the manufacturer's procedures. Conventional SALL4 deficient ES cells were established by methods known in the art.\n\n\nExample 1 : Molecular Analysis of SALL4\n\n\nMolecular cloning of two alternatively splicing isoforms of human SALL4\n\n\n[0225] Two full-length transcripts of S ALL4 were isolated by 5 ' and 3 ' RACE-PCR (rapid amplification of the 5' and 3' cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction) with the use of fetal human kidney Marathon-Ready cDNAs (BD Biosciences Clontech) as templates.\n\n\nWEST\\21413050 1 356077-000029 \n\n [0226] Sequence analysis of the larger cDNA fragment isolated revealed a single, large open reading frame, designated as SALL4A that started from a strong consensus initiation sequence and was expected to encode 1,053 amino acids. The other splicing variant of SALL4, designated SALL4B, lacked the region corresponding to amino acids 385—820 of the full-length SALL4A (Fig. Ia). The putative protein encoded by SALL4B cDNA was expected to consist of 617 amino acids.\n\n\n[0227] To rule out the possibility that these two apparent splicing variants might result from artifacts, both variant mRNA sequences with corresponding sequences of the human genome were compared. SALL4A contained all exons (1—4) (Fig. Ia), whereas SALL4B lacked the 3' large portion of exon 2. Both exon-intron splice sites satisfied the G-T-A-G rule. Both splicing variants had the same translational reading frame, but SALL4B mRNA encoded a protein with internal deletions. SALL4A contained eight zinc finger domains, while SALL4B had three zinc finger domains.\n\n\nExpression pattern of the SALL4 isoforms in human tissues\n\n\n[0228] The alternative splicing patterns of SALL4 were delineated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR in a variety of human tissues. A fragment of the ubiquitous GAPDH gene cDNA was amplified as a control (Fig. Ib). A 315-bp fragment representing the longer splice variant, SALL4A, was amplified in some tissues, achieving various expression levels. The SALL4B variant was present in every tissue at varying levels of expression. Detailed studies on S ALL4 expression in hematopoietic tissues are described in the following results.\n\n\nGeneration of S ALL4 antibody and identification of S ALL4 protein products\n\n\n[0229] To identify SALL4 gene products and confirm the presence of SALL4 variants, a polyclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide (amino acids 1-13) of SALL4 was developed. This region was chosen because it is common to both SALL4 variants. The affinity-purified SALL4 peptide antibody recognized specifically two endogenous proteins in a human kidney total lysate. The two proteins were approximately 165 kDa and 95 kDa, which were identical to the molecular weights of overexpressed S ALL4A and SALL4B in Cos-7 cells, respectively (Fig. Ic). Western blotting with this antibody confirmed that the SALL4 isoforms had different tissue distributions that were similar to those observed at the mRNA level (Fig. Ib-B).\n\n\nWESTY21413050.1 356077-000029 \n\n Failure of S ALL4 to turn off in human primary AML and myeloid leukemia cell lines\n\n\n[0230] Because the chromosome region 20ql 3, where SALL4 is located, is frequently involved in tumors, SALL4 mRNA expression in AML was examined. Expression of SALL4 was quantitatively investigated by real-time RT-PCR in bone marrow cells derived from AML samples (N=I 5), myeloid leukemia cell lines (N=3) and compared with that of non-neoplastic hematopoietic cells from a purified CD34+ stem/progenitor pool (HSCs/HPCs purchased from Cambrex), normal bone marrow (N=3), and normal peripheral blood (N=3). With the use of isoform-specific primers (see Fig. 2a), either or both SALL4B and/or SALL4A, failed to be turned off (S ALL4B) or down-regulated (S ALL4 A) in all AML samples and myeloid leukemia cell lines. The data were normalized to the endogenous expression of GAPDH and calibrated against the level of S ALL4A or S ALL4B expression in purified CD34+ cells. In contrast to the total absence of SALL4B in normal bone marrow, its expression in primary AML failed to be turned off in 13 of 15 AML samples and in all three myeloid leukemia cell lines. The median normalized level of SALL4A in primary AML samples was 40-fold higher than that in normal bone marrow. SALL4A expression levels in the myeloid leukemia cell lines KG.l, Kasumi-1, and THP-I were, respectively, 8-, 25-, and 240-fold higher than those in normal bone marrow. Interestingly, both SALL4A and SALL4B expression levels were increased in 60% of AML samples and in all three cell lines, compared with those in normal bone marrow. In the remaining 40% of AML samples, either SALL4A or SALL4B failed to be down-regulated.\n\n\nConstitutive expression of SALL4 protein in human primary AML\n\n\n[0231] To investigate whether the observed aberrant SALL4 expression was also present at the protein level, 81 AML samples were examined, ranging from AML classes Ml to M5 (FAB classification): Ml (N=20), M2 (N=27), M3 (N=8), M4 (N=I 6), M5 (N=3), and AML nonspecified (N=7); several samples of normal bone marrow, thymus and spleen, as well as normal CD34+ HSCs/HPCs.\n\n\n[0232] Normal bone marrow, spleen and thymus showed no detectable SALL4 protein expression, and normal CD34+ HSCs/HPCs exhibited positive but weaker SALL4 protein staining; however, much stronger SALL4 expression was detected in the nuclei of leukemic cells (Fig. 2b-F). AU 81 AML samples showed aberrant SALL4 expression, with the strongest staining seen in AML-Ml and -M2. These findings were consistent with SALL4 mRNA expression levels demonstrated by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 2a). The data suggested that SALL4\n\n\nWESΑ21413050.1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n was present in CD34+ HSCs/HPCs and down-regulated in mature granulocytes and lymphocytes. As a result, the constitutive expression of SALL4 in leukemia may have prevented the leukemic blasts from differentiating and/or gaining properties that were normally seen in HSCs.\n\n\nGeneration of transgenic mice constitutively expressing full-length human SALL4B\n\n\n[0233] To directly test whether constitutive expression of S ALL4 is sufficient to induce AML, a S ALL4 transgenic mouse model was generated. The CMV promoter was fused to cDNA that encoded the 617 amino acids of human SALL4B (Fig. 3 a- A), which was chosen because it was expressed in every tissue previously examined (Fig. Ib-B). The CMV promoter was previously used to ectopically express human genes in most murine organs. RT-PCR amplification was performed to examine the overexpression of wildtype (WT), full-length SALL4B in the transgenic mice.\n\n\n[0234] A SALL4B transcript was detected in a variety of tissues from the transgenic mice, including brain, kidney, liver, spleen, peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow (Fig. 3 a- B). Abnormal gaits and associated hydrocephalus 3 weeks after birth were observed in 20% of the transgenic mice from multiple lines; 60% had polycystic kidneys. These findings suggest that SALL4B plays an important role in neural and renal development.\n\n\nMD S -like symptoms and AML in SALL4B transgenic mice\n\n\n[0235] Monitoring of hematological abnormalities in a cohort of 14 transgenic mice from all six lines revealed that all mice had apparent MDS-like features at ages 6-8 months. Increased number of immature blasts and many atypical and dysplastic white cells, including hypersegmented neutrophils and pseudo-Pelger-Huet-like cells, were seen on peripheral blood smears (Fig. 3b). Nucleate red blood cells and giant platelets were also present, as well as erythroid and megakaryocyte dysplastic features, such as binucleate erythroid precursors and hypolobulated megakaryocytes.\n\n\n[0236] Six (43%) of these 14 mice eventually progressed to acute leukemia (Table 1).\n\n\nWESTO 1413050.1 356077-000029 \n\n Table 1.

Leukemia blast cells were considered to be myeloid in origin because they were positive for CD34, c-kit, Gr-I, Mac-1, MPO, and nonspecific esterase; they were negative for B-cell (B220 and CD 19), T-cell (CD4, CD8, CD3, and CD5), megakaryocyte (CD41), and erythroid (Terl 19) markers (Fig. 3d).\n\n\nS ALL4B -induced AML was transplantable.\n\n\n[0238] Aggressive fatal AML with onset at approximately 6 weeks developed in immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice after serial transplantation of SALL4B-induced AML cells by subcutaneous injection. The transplanted disease was characterized by dissemination to multiple organs, with marked splenomegaly and hepatomegaly (Fig. 3e).\n\n\nIneffective hematopoiesis and excessive apoptosis in SALL4B transRenic mice.\n\n\n[0239] Investigation of hematological abnormalities in younger SALL4B transgenic mice (2- 6 months old) revealed that their peripheral blood showed minimal myelodysplastic features but statistically significant leukopenia and neutropenia, as well as mild anemia (Table 2).\n\n\nWEST\\21413050.1 356077-000029 \n\n Table 2. CBC from SALL4B Transgenic Mice and Wild Type Control\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0240] To determine whether the cause of cytopenia in these transgenic mice was related to production problems, their bone marrow was studied. Bone marrow samples showed increased cellularity and an increased myeloid population (Fig. 3f), compared with those of WT controls (Gr-I /Mac- 1 double-positive population in SALL4B transgenic mice: 67±16%, N=IO vs. WT: 55.3±4%, N=l l ; P=0.048).\n\n\n[0241] As excessive apoptosis plays a central role in ineffective hematopoiesis in human MDS\n5\n apoptosis in SALL4 transgenic mice in vivo and in vitro was examined next. Increased apoptosis was observed in SALL4B transgenic mice on both primary bone marrow (Annexin V- positive, Pi-negative population in transgenic mice: 4.4±2.4%, N=IO vs. WT: 1.86±1.55%, N=7; P=O.03) and day-7 CFUs (Annexin V-positive, Pi-negative population in transgenic mice: 20.1±6%, N=IO vs. WT: 10.9±4%, N=7; P=0.002) (Fig. 3f and g). These findings may account for the fact that despite an increased myeloid population in bone marrow, these transgenic mice had statistically significant low neutrophil counts in the peripheral blood, secondary to an ongoing ineffective myelopoiesis in their bone marrow. An increased population of immature cells was also noted in SALL4B transgenic mice on both primary bone marrow (c-kit-positive population in SALL4B transgenic mice: 10.2±1.3%, N=14 vs. WT: 6.5±2.5%, N=IO; P=0.008) (Fig. 3f) and day-7 CFUs (CD34-positive population in SALL4B transgenic mice: 11±2.2%, N=8 vs. WT: 6.3±2.4%, N=7; P=0.002) (Fig. 3g). Similar numbers of total colonies were observed in SALL4B transgenic mice (mean=51, N=IO) and WT controls (mean=40, N=6). Increased myeloid and decreased erythroid colony populations (Fig. 3h), however, were found in S ALL4B transgenic mouse CFUs compared with those of WT controls, as has been reported in human MDS patients and other MDS mouse models. These observations suggest that the defect in SALL4B transgenic mice lies at the stem cell/progenitor level affecting hematopoietic differentiation.\n\n\nWEST\\21413050.1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n Binding; of SALL4A and SALL4B to β-Catenin in vitro.\n\n\n[0242] The potential signaling pathway that SALL4 may affect in leukemogenesis was explored next. In Drosophila, spalt (sal) is a downstream target of Wnt signaling. ALLl, another member of the SALL gene family, can interact with β-catenin. The high affinity site for this interaction is located at the C-terminal double zinc finger domain. This region of SALLl was found to be almost exactly identical to that of SALL4. This finding prompted the investigation of whether SALL4 was also able to bind β-12 catenin. Expression constructs of SALL4A and SALL4B tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) were generated. As shown in Fig. 4a, endogenous β-catenin was pulled down by HA-SALL4A and HA-SALL4B, but not by HA alone.\n\n\nActivation of the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway by both SALL4A and SALL4B.\n\n\n[0243] To investigate the functional effect of the interaction of the SALL4 isoforms with β- catenin, a luciferase reporter (TOPflash; Upstate USA) containing multiple copies of Wnt- responsive elements to determine the potential of SALL4A and SALL4B to activate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway was used. This reporter construct has been shown to be efficiently stimulated by Wntl in a variety of cell lines. TOPflash reporter plasmid was transiently transfected in the HEK-293 cell line, in which both Wnt and its Wnt/β-catenin signal pathways were present. TOPflash reporter plasmid was also cotransfected with SALL4A or SALL4B. Significant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by both SALL4A and SALL4B was indicated by increased luciferase activity (Fig. 4b).\n\n\nSimilar expression patterns of β-Catenin and SALL4 at different phases of CML.\n\n\n[0244] Dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling is known to be involved in the development of LSCs. The best evidence for β-catenin's involvement in LSC self-renewal comes from the study of CML blast transformation. It has been demonstrated that Wnt signaling was activated in the blast phase of CML but not the chronic phase, where it was concluded that dysregulated Wnt signaling, such as activation of β-catenin, could confer the property of self-renewal on the GMPs of CML and lead to their blastic transformation.\n\n\n[0245] Given the potential interaction between SALL4 and β-catenin and spalt' s position as a downstream target of Wnt signaling in Drosophila, SALL4 protein expression in CMLs in different phases was examined. SALL4 expression was present in blast-phase CML (N= 12,\n\n\nWEST\\21413\n05\n01 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n75%) but not the chronic phase (N=I 1,100%) (Fig. 4c). In the accelerated phase (N=6, 10%), in which blast counts are increased, immature blasts expressing SALL4 were observed upon a background of nonstaining mature myeloid cells, such as neutrophils.\n\n\nEffect of SALL4 on OCT4 promoter.\n\n\n[0246] To identify the effect of SALL4 on OCT4, cells, OCT4-Luc constructs were co- transfected with renilla plasmids and increasing concentrations of SALL4B (FIG. 5). As the figure shows increasing SALL4B increased OCT4 promoter activity by more than 8 fold.\n\n\n[0247] To determine if OCT4 stimulates the activity of SALL gene member promoters, promoter constructs (pSALLl, pSALL3, and pSALL4) were co-transfected with OCT4 in HEK- 293 cells. As can be seen from the data (FIG. 6), after 24 hr post-transfection, the overexpression of OCT4 strikingly stimulated the promoter activities of SALL gene members SALLl, SALL3, and SALL4 when compared with that of the pcDNA3 vector control. Also, this activation was totally blocked by the presence of a small amount of excess SALL4 (FIG. 10).\n\n\n[0248] To determine whether there was any self regulation of SALL promoters by SALL family member proteins, S ALL4-Luc was co-transfected with renilla reporter and either SALL4A or SALL4B expression plasmids is HEK-293 and COS-7 cells (FIG. 7). As shown in the figure, SALL4 (both A and B isoforms) suppresses its own promoter activity in different cell lines. Further, this self-suppression is dose dependent (see, FIG. 8). When the ratio of SALL4A with SALL4 promoter reached 6:1, the promoter activity dropped approximately 3.5 fold compared with the basal level. This data indicates that SALL4 bears a self-suppression function. This is not true for all SALL members, for example, SALLl fails to demonstrate self- suppression of its promoter (FIG. 12).\n\n\n[0249] Data also indicates that SALLl and SALL3 promoters were strikingly activated by exogenously added SALL4 (See, FIG. 9), indicating that SALL4 is able to regulate other members of the SALL gene family involving embryonic stem cell function.\n\n\n[0250] Since the stimulation of OCT4 on SALL4 promoter can be totally blocked by SALL4 (FIG. 10), SALL4 was examined to determine if it represses the activation of OCT4 on other SALL member promoters. As can be seen in FIG. 11, SALL4 also blocked OCT4 activation of other SALL member promoters.\n\n\nWEST\\214130SO 1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n SALL4 in adult stem cells and embryonic carcinoma.\n\n\n[0251] The characterization of tissue stem cell populations remains difficult because of the lack of markers that can distinguish between stem cells and their differentiating progeny. For many tissues, panels of molecular markers have been developed to define the stem cell compartment.\n\n\n[0252] The present data shows that SALL4 is a key regulator of embryonic stem cells in pluripotency and self-renewal. For example, embryonic carcinomas display the phenotype of early embryonic stem cells and possess pluripotent potential. Therefore, the expression of SALL4 protein in this type of tumors by immunohistochemistry was examined. Immunohistochemical data conclusively indicated that all tumor cells of embryonic carcinomas showed a nuclear staining, whereas all non-tumor cells were negative. These observations suggest that S ALL4 can be used as a specific marker for normal and malignant embryonic germ cells and embryonic stem cells.\n\n\n[0253] Given that SALL4 was expressed in very early embryonic stem cells, and embryonic carcinoma is reported to arise from transformation of these cells, immunohistochemistry also shows that a) SALL4 positive cells in normal breast lobules, accounted for less than 2% of the epithelium and b) in breast carcinoma samples, S ALL4 protein expression in clusters of cells or scattered cells was observed. Further, SALL4 protein was expressed in the nucleus of normal breast epithelial cells and breast carcinoma cells. Moreover, this pluripotent gene expression was observed in other normal adult tissues such as prostate and lung, and carcinoma arising from these tissues with S ALL4 antibody. The presence of a small number of S ALL4-expressing cells in the broncho-epithelium and prostatic acini, and their stromal cells was observed, as well as the finding that SALL4 was expressed at a similar frequency in normal prostate and lung to that in lobular epithelial cells of breast. In addition, scattered tumor cells in the prostate carcinoma expressed SALL4 protein by immunohistochemistry studies with a SALL4 antibody.\n\n\n[0254] The above examples reveal that (1) immunostaining with anti-SALL4 antibodies are useful diagnostic tools in the identification of embryonic carcinomas, (2) expression of SALL4 is found in several human stem cells and cancer cells; (3) identification of SALL4-expressing cells in human tissues can be used to identify the stem cells, their pre-malignant clones, and malignant cells, and (4) SALL4 represents an ideal marker for embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells and cancer stem cells.\n\n\nWESTY21413050.1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n Example 2: SALL4 is a major master regulator in ES cells\n\n\n[0255] Growing evidence has shown that Sall4 plays a vital role in governing ES cell fate decisions. SALL4 is expressed early in embryonic development and exhibits a similar expression pattern to that of Oct4. SALL4 -null ES cells exhibited significantly reduced proliferation and microinjection of SALL4 small interfering RNA into mouse zygotes resulted in reduction of S ALL4 and Oct4 mRNAs prior to implantation. These findings prompt the investigation into global downstream targets of SALL4 in embryonic cells. Using a ChIP-chip assay, a genome scale mapping of SALL4 binding genes was carried out in the murine embryonic stem cell line W4. Using the RefSeq promoter tiling array provided by NimbleGen Systems Inc, a 2.7kb region (2kb upstream and 500bp downstream from the transcription start site) of each promoter region was probed. Hybridizations to these arrays with S ALL4 chromatin- immunoprecipitated DNA from W4 cells revealed a massive gene binding, with a total binding of 5,256 genes. Analysis of these Sall4 binding genes based on the PANTHER classification system showed that about 73% of the classified genes are involved in either proliferation and self-renewal or differentiation and development.\n\n\n[0256] Based on recently published data, the stem cell gene binding pattern by SALL4 was compared with that of the gatekeeper genes Oct4 and Nanog.\n\n\n[0257] Data derived from a similar Chip-PET assay shows that Oct4 binds only 1083 genes and Nanog binds 3006 genes. These binding numbers are strikingly less than that of Sall4, even though CHIP -PET method has a higher probe resolution.\n\n\n[0258] During development, both SALL4 and Oct4 are expressed in the very early stage of the embryonic development. SALL4 expression is already seen in the 2-cell stage with Oct4, while Nanog is expressed once development reaches the blastocyst stage. The earlier expression and extensive gene binding may suggest that SALL4 exert an even larger and more massive role in regulating ES cell features.\n\n\n[0259] Next, determination of the distribution of the Oct4, Nanog, and SALL4 binding genes in ES cells was sought. Comparison of the three gene groups show that SALL4 binds a total of 229 genes which are also targets of Oct4, we will refer to these genes as co-bound or co- occupied. This represents 21% of all Oct4 bound genes. Similarly, SALL4 co-binds to 535 Nanog target genes, representing 18% of Nanog's total binding sites (Fig 13). There are a total of\n\n\nWESTY21413050.] 356077-000029 \n\n118 genes that are co-occupied by all of Oct4, S ALL4 and Nanog. PANTHER classification shows that 79% of these co— occupied genes belong to either self-renewal/proliferation or developmental/differentiation processes. These findings raise a possibility that many pluripotency maintenance genes may be coordinated by a complex network consisting at least of Oct4, Sall4 and Nanog.\n\n\nInteraction of SALL4 with Oct4 and Nanog in ES cells\n\n\n[0260] Given the similar gene promoter co-occupancies and gene expression patterns between Sall4-Oct4 and SALL4 -Nanog, it was thought that an Oct4- SALL4 -Nanog complex exists. For this purpose, an immunocoprecipitation experiment was performed on Sall4 and Oct4 using a transiently SALL4-HA transfected ES cell extract. As seen in the western blot result (Hg 13b and 13c), over-expression of SALL4-HA fusion protein was detected by both anti-HA and anti- SALL4 antibodies (the latter not shown). In the HA antibody treated cell lysate, a unique ~45kd band was successfully detected; its size matches the endogenous Oct4 control. By contrast, an IgG negative control failed to generate Oct4 band in the same extract, indicating a direct Sall4- Oct4 interaction (Fig 13b and 13c). Using the same method, the Sall4/Nanog interaction was also confirmed in the same anti HA-pulldown cell lysate (Fig. 13b and 13c). Based on these results, it is not surprising that Oct4, SALL4, Nanog, and possibly others, form a complex which contributes to regulation of ESC features through internal interactions. This is strengthened due to the significant co-occupancies among Sall4, Oct4 and Nanog target genes. Further studies are still required to extend the knowledge of the Oct4- SALL4 -Nanog complex.\n\n\nGenes related to differentiation and pluripotency\n\n\n[0261] Based on this data, it seemed that SALL4 represses genes leading to differentiation and activates genes that are necessary for pluripotency. For this, 217 of the SALL4 bound genes identified as necessary for cell differentiation were analyzed, some of which are specifically expressed in different developmental lineages. As seen in Fig 14, SALL4 binds with multiple markers from all of the lineages including ectoderm, endoderm, mesoderm and trophectoderm, suggesting a direct involvement in regulating cell differentiation and pluripotency. Using our conditional Sall4 knockout ES cell lines, we were able to verify changes of these marker expression levels after endogenous SALL4 knockdown. The W4 clone EC 228, in which one copy SALL4 allele was floxed, was treated with Cre expressing adenovirus for 9 hours and gene\n\n\nWEST\\214130S0.1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n expression was evaluated by qPCR. For differentiation analysis, we chose 4 candidate markers for each cell lineage.\n\n\n[0262] Data from three separate experiments show that Sall4 expression levels were consistently shutdown up to about 50%, confirming that EC228 is a successful and stable gene targeting system. Interestingly, the tested markers for ectoderm, endoderm, and trophectoderm were all suppressed by SALL4, while two of the three mesoderm markers are activated. In other words, it indicates that SALL4 has a role in suppressing ectoderm, endoderm, and trophectoderm differentiation, while activating differentiation into mesoderm lineages (Fig 14b).\n\n\n[0263] We also evaluated SALL4's binding to genes known to maintain pluripotency. We identified only 15 pluripotency genes (Assou et al, Stem Cells) that are common to SALL4 target genes suggesting that SALL4 has little role in maintaining pluripotency but rather, functions to inhibit differentiation.\n\n\nES cell pluripotency and proliferation are dependent on SALL4 expression\n\n\n[0264] As described previously, embryonic endoderm ES cells can not be established from SALL4 deficient blastocyts. The W4-EC228 clone was cultured in feeder free T25 flasks and treated with Ade-Cre. Morphology changes were observed within 9 hours of treatment. Alkaline Phosphatase staining of ESCs was demonstrated. Analysis of layer markers was done by qPCR.\n\n\nSall4 binds to tarfiet genes of PRCl and PRC2\n\n\n[0265] The term Polycomb-Repressive Complexes (PRCs) has been recently reported and consists of two distinct groups. PRCl consists of >10 subunits including Bmil, Rnf2, Phcl and the HPC proteins while the PRC2 contains Ezh2, Eed, Suzl2 and RbAp48. PRCs maintain ES cell pluripotency through epigenic events such as methylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27), thus suppressing differentiation related activators. To better understand how SALL binding genes are related to PRCs, the genome binding patterns by SALL4 were compared with those of polycomb genes which have been published previously. It is known in the art that 4 genes, Rnf2, Phcl (from PRCl), Suzl2, and Eed (from PRC2), co-occupied 512 common genes in murine ES cells, many of which encode transcription factors with important roles in development. Direct comparisons with these data show that 28.3% (360/1271) of Suzl2 target genes and 27.8% (339/1219) of Rnf2 targets were co-bound by SALL4. Analysis of these two groups of common genes shows that over 75% of them are involved in proliferation/self-renewal or\n\n\nWESTV21413O5O.1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n differentiation/development. This indicates PRCl, PRC2 and Sall4 are co-binding a large block of ESC feature governing genes (Fig. 15a).\n\n\n[0266] The transcription factors bound by two PRC genes (Suzl2, Rnf2) were selected and compared with those bound by SALL4. Suzl2 binds to unique transcription factors Lrch4 and Lhmx2, however, it shares many overlapping sites with either SALL4 or Rnf2. The same can be said for Rnf2 (Fig. 15b). Genes bound by Rnf2, Suzl2, and Sall4 include multiple homeobox genes, Zicl, Gata4, and Lefl. SALL4 is exceptional because it binds to 339 transcription factors many of which are involved in development. In fact, we found SALL4 binds to a large group of homeobox genes and other developmentally important genes, including HOX, FOX, F-Box, and T-box family members independently of polycomb binding (Fig 15b and Table 4).\n\n\nTable 4: Key developmental genes bound by Sall4 Hox Genes homeo box A1 Hoxal homeo box A11 Hoxal 1 homeo box A3 Hoxa3 homeo box A4 Hoxa4 homeo box A5 Hoxaδ homeo box A7 Hoxa7 homeo box A9 Hoxa9 homeo box B2 Hoxb2 homeo box B5 Hoxbδ homeo box B6 Hoxb6 homeo box B7 Hoxb7 homeo box B8 Hoxbδ homeo box C10 HoxdO homeo box C11 Hoxd 1 homeo box C4 Hoxc4 homeo box C6 Hoxcθ homeo box C9 Hoxc9 homeo box D10 HoxdiO homeo box D12 Hoxd 12 homeo box D3 Hoxd3 homeo box D4 Hoxd4\n\n\nI Paired Domain I paired box gene 3 Pax3 paired box gene 2 Pax2 paired box gene 9 Pax9 paired box gene 1 Pax1\n\n\nI Lim Domain I\n\n\nLIM homeobox protein 2 Lhx2\n\n\nLIM homeobox protein 3 Lhx3\n\n\nLIM homeobox protein 8 Lhxδ\n\n\nLIM homeobox protein 9 Lhx9\n\n\nWESTV214130\n50\n. l 350077-000029 \n\n Six/sine homeobox sine oculis-related homeobox 2 homolog\n\n\n(Drosophila) Six2 sine oculis-related homeobox 3 homolog\n\n\n(Drosophila) Six3\n\n\nDIx family distal-less homeobox 1 Dlx1 distal-less homeobox 5 Dlx5\n\n\nI Fork head box forkhead box A2 Foxa2 forkhead box B1 Foxbi forkhead box C1 Foxd forkhead box D3 Foxd3 forkhead box D4 Foxd4 forkhead box F2 Foxf2 forkhead box G1 Foxgi forkhead box H1 Foxhi forkhead box 11 FoxM forkhead box J2 Foxj2 forkhead box N4 Foxn4 forkhead box 01 Foxo1 forkhead box P2 Foxp2 forkhead box P3 Foxp3 similar to forkhead box R2 LOC436240\n\n\nT-box family\n\n\nT-box 19 Tbx19\n\n\nT-box18 Tbx18\n\n\nT-box 15 Tbx15\n\n\nT-box 21 Tbx21\n\n\nT-box 22 Tbx22\n\n\nOocyte Homeobox Family oocyte specific homeobox 1 Oboxi oocyte specific homeobox 3 Obox3 oocyte specific homeobox 6 Obox6\n\n\nF-Box family\n\n\nF-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 10 Fbxl 10\n\n\nF-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 13 Fbxl13\n\n\nF-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 18 Fbxl 18\n\n\nF-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 21 Fbxl21\n\n\nF-box and WD-40 domain protein 10 Fbxwi 0\n\n\nF-box and WD-40 domain protein 12 Fbxw12\n\n\nF-box and WD-40 domain protein 14 Fbxw14\n\n\nF-box and WD-40 domain protein 9 Fbxwθ\n\n\nF-box only protein 36 Fbxo36 f-box only protein 9 Fbxo9\n\n\nF-box protein 28 Fbxo28\n\n\nF-box protein 42 Fbxo42\n\n\nPaired-like domain paired-like homeobox 2b Phox2b paired related homeobox 2 Prrx2\n\n\nWESTV21413050.1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n Other homeobox genes homeo box, msh-like 2 Msx2 even skipped homeotic gene 2 homolog Evx2 aristaless related homeobox gene (Drosophila) Arx brain specific homeobox Bsx caudal type homeo box 4 Cdx4 developing brain homeobox 1 Dbx1 diencephalon/mesencephalon homeobox 1 Dmbxi extraembryonic, spermatogenesis, homeobox 1 Esx1 genomic screened homeo box 2 Gsh2\n\n\nH2.0-like homeo box 1 (Drosophila) HIxI homeobox containing 1 Hmboxi\n\n\nH6 homeo box 1 Hmx1\n\n\nH6 homeo box 2 Hmx2 homeobox only domain Hod\n\n\nIroquois related homeobox 6 (Drosophila) Irx6 ladybird homeobox homolog 2 (Drosophila) Lbx2 mesenchyme homeobox 2 Meox2\n\n\nUnc4.1 homeobox (C. elegans) Uncx4.1 ventral anterior homeobox containing gene 2 Vax2 zinc finger homeobox 1 b Zfhxi b reproductive homeobox 4B Rhox4b reproductive homeobox 7 Rhox7\n\n\nPbx/knotted 1 homeobox 2 Pknox2 prospero-related homeobox 1 Proxi\n\n\nK4 K27 Bivalent domains are bound by SALL4\n\n\n[0267] Recently it has been reported that the existence of bivalent domains regulate pluripotency through a balance of H3K4 gene activation and H3K27 gene repression. By comparing our data with previously published bivalent domains we show that Sall4 binds to over 40% (54/122) of non-duplicate bivalent domains identified in the study. Interestingly, SALL4 only binds to three K27 bound genes, and 27 K4 genes aside from the genes covered by bivalent domains. This indicates that Sall4 may control a select region of developmentally important genes through a balance of activation and repression methylations. However, it appears as though SALL4 plays a larger role in the activation of certain genes.\n\n\n[0268] When genes are associated with bivalent domains, they have been shown to have low expression levels due to the methylation at K27 having a more pronounced effect on expression than the activating K4 methylation. Thus, we would expect the 54 genes identified in this study to have low expression levels in SALL4 expressing cells, but cannot predict the effects of SALL4 shutdown.\n\n\nWEST\\21413050.1 356077-000029 \n\n SALL4 targets important signals that control ES differentiation and lineage specification\n\n\n[0269] Key signaling pathways that play important roles in maintaining pluripotency during embryogenesis include the STAT3, Notch, Nodal, TGF beta and Wnt signaling pathways. In fact, SΛLL4 is binding to genes that are involved in each of these pathways (Figure 16). The Wnt signaling pathway has important roles in embryogenesis and cancer, while the STAT3 pathway is the key signal required for murine ESC self-renewal following LIF binding to the LIF/gpl30 receptor complex. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP, TGF beta) signaling plays important roles in diverse embryonic events including induction of mesoderm, hematopoiesis and epidermis formation. The Nodal pathway belongs to the TGF-β superfamily, is largely restricted to stem cells and sustains pluripotent cells in the mouse epiblast before axial pattering. Notch signaling pathway affects a diverse range of development processes controlling cell differentiation, proliferation, morphogenesis and organ formation. Since more than 85 SALL4 binding genes are involved in Wnt pathway or as downstream targets, we will use this pathway as an example for further analysis (see below).\n\n\nComparison of ChIP-chip and gene expression\n\n\n[0270] Based on a genome-wide expression profile, Kim et al (Nature 2005) classified the enriched binding genes into four categories to elucidate the expression of the target genes. A similar strategy combined with endogenous Sall4 knockdown was used here to confirm which SALL4 binding genes are indeed regulated by SALL4 levels. For this purpose, our conditional knock out W4-EC228 clone was used for expression microarray. Quantitative PCR validation indicates that Cre-induced SALL4 knockdown is much more efficient and consistent when compared to RNAi or other conventional knock outs that we tested. Comparison of expression profile after Sall4 knockdown shows that 46% of the binding genes have a dramatic change in the expression level.\n\n\n[0271] Expression profile showed little change of expression for the pluripotency genes, only two bound genes were upregulated when SALL4 is knockdown, suggesting that SALL4 may have little role in maintaining pluripotency but rather, functions to inhibit differentiation. This supports the case for SALL4 has a differentiation repressor but indicates that Sall4 has little effect on pluripotency.\n\n\nWEST\\214130\n5\n0 1 3S6077-000029 \n\n [0272] To elicit the effects that SALL4 may have on the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, we compared gene expression values in EC228 cells after Cre treatment. Interestingly, expression profiling shows that SALL4 shutdown has an effect on nearly all of the members of the pathway (Fig 17). Down-regulation of SALL4 results in higher levels of β-cantenin and in combination with other proteins changes transcriptional regulation. Of note, we show that SALL4 does not directly bind all the down-regulated genes in the pathways. In each pathway, SALL4 binds to select genes and regulates others through intermediate mechanisms.\n\n\n[0273] Our data, when presented together with others data, outline a system in which SALL4:\n\n\n(1) has a similar expression pattern to Oct4 and is expressed earlier in development than Nanog,\n\n\n(2) binds to the promoter regions of more genes than either Oct4 or Nanog, (3) causes differentiation when deficiencies exist, (4) binds more bivalent domains than Oct4 and Nanog, and (5) is a lethal knockout, like Oct4 and Nanog. This suggests that SALL4 plays a central role in maintaining the pluripotency of ESCs.\n\n\n[0274] We have shown that SALL4 binds over 5,000 promoter regions within the murine ESCs. An analogous ChIP-PET assay was done on murine ESCs to test promoter regions that Oct4 and Nanog bind to and results from this assay show that Oct4 binds to about 1,000 gene promoters and Nanog binds about 3,000. It is interesting that SALL4 binds nearly 2,000 more genes than Nanog and is expressed earlier in development. Because promoter binding does not indicate expression of a gene, this may or may not be significant. For our data, we can say that SALL4 binds to 5256 promoter regions and causes significant transcript level changes in X% of these genes.\n\n\n[0275] Sall4 knockdown cells spontaneously differentiate. Previous studies have stated that this differentiation is into trophectoderm lineages. Here, it appears as though knockdown results in differentiation into endoderm, ectoderm, and trophectoderm lineages based on real-time PCR. These findings may differ due to different methods of transfection. In our experiment expression levels were measured right after endogenous SALL4 shutdown. This is in contrast to previously published data that use stable transfection and allow other genes to compensate for Sall4 shutdown.\n\n\n[0276] Bivalent domains have recently been reported to play an integral role in cell differentiation and pluripotency through epigenic regulation. These domains consist of large regions of H3K27 methylation sites harboring smaller H3K4 methylation sites, which are often\n\n\nWEST\\21413050.1 356077-000029 \n\n centered over developmentally important genes. Interestingly, SALL4 binds to about 40% of the bivalent domains reported. In contrast, Oct4 binds 10% and Nanog binds 20%. The roles of these proteins in regulation of bivalent domains is unknown, but it can be hypothesized that Sall4, or another regulatory gene, plays a role in the balance of activation and repression through epigenic events at these bivalent domains. Bernstein et al originally reported that Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 bind to nearly 50% of the bivalent domains that they reported, however, this information was based on humans ESCs. Thus, our comparison in murine ESCs has varied slightly.\n\n\n[0277] Polycomb group proteins occupy genes that are repressed in ESCs. They have been shown to co-occupy a significant portion of these genes with Oct4 and Nanog. Here we show that they also co-occupy a large portion of them with SALL4. Interestingly, SALL4 binding does not show preference over PRCl or PRC2 as it binds about 30% of total genes from each group. Intuitively this makes sense however, because Sall4 is largely binding to developmental/self-renewal processes. By comparing the transcription factor bound by each Suzl2, Rnf2, and SALL4 we are able to identify genes that may be regulated by SALL4. These included a large group of homeobox genes, as well as developmental genes Zicl, Gata4, and Lefl.\n\n\n[0278] These findings have brought many interesting questions to the forefront. The binding of Sall4 to the recently reported bivalent domains is extremely interesting and will be the subject of further study. Similarly, many questions remain to be answered regarding evidence for an Oct4- SALL4 -Nanog complex regulating gene expression and ESC pluripotency. This provides one mechanism by which the expression levels of the complex target genes are stably maintained.\n\n\nExample 3: SALL4 in ES cells and LSCs\n\n\n[0279] S ALL4 may be one of few genes that creates a connection between LSCs and the self- renewal properties of normal HSCs and ES cells. Interestingly, SALL4 protein expression is always correlated with the presence of stem and progenitor cell populations in various organ systems including bone marrow.\n\n\nWEST\\214I3050.1 356077-0000\n2\n9 \n\n Constitutive expression of SALL4 protein in primary human AML and SALL4 expression in MDS is associated with high-grade morphology\n\n\n[0280] Amplification of the SALL4 gene, as demonstrated by digital karyotyping or analysis through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), is seen in approximately 75 percent of human AML cases. To determine if the observed aberrant SALL4 expression is also present at the protein level, 81 AMI, samples ranging from AML subtypes Ml to M5 (FAB classification) were examined. All 81 AML samples have shown aberrant SALL4 expression, which was consistent with the SALL4 mRNA expression levels as demonstrated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) amplification, hi normal hematopoiesis, SALL4 was present in the CD34\n+\n HSCs/HPCs and down-regulated in mature granulocytes and lymphocytes. As a result, constitutive expression of SALL4 in leukemia may have prevented the leukemic blasts from differentiating and/or gaining self- renewal properties.\n\n\n[0281] The expression of the SALL4 protein in human samples containing differing grades of MDS was also examined using immunohistochemistry with an affinity-purified SALL4 antibody. Using a cut-off of >5 percent SALL4 positive cells, all low-grade MDS groups (RA, refractory anemia, and RARS, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts) were negative for SALL4. SALL4 positivity — defined as more than 5 percent of immunolabeled cells — was detected in 10 of 11 high-grade MDS groups. The high-grade MDS groups were further contrasted with respect to the percentage of S ALL4 positive cells. RAEB-2 (refractory anemia with excess blasts-2) and AML transformation showed a relatively high percentage (>10 percent). The highest percentage of SALL4 positive cells was seen in AML transformation (>20 percent). This indicates that the high percentage of SALL4-expressing cells correlates with a high-grade morphology in MDS.\n\n\nSALL4B transgenic mice are an ideal mouse model for human MDS\n\n\n[0282] Monitoring hematological abnormalities in a cohort of 17 transgenic mice from all 6 founders revealed that all mice exhibited apparent MDS-like features at age 2 months. Increased numbers of immature blasts and many atypical and dysplastic white cells, including hypersegmented neutrophils and pseudo-Pelger-Huet-like cells, were seen on peripheral blood smears. Nucleated red blood cells and giant platelets were also present, as well as erythroid and megakaryocyte dysplastic features, such as binucleated erythroid precursors and hypolobulated megakaryocytes. Nine (53 percent) of the 17 mice eventually progressed to AML after age 7-15\n\n\nWEST\\21413050.1 356077-000029 \n\n months. Leukemic infiltration of many organs, including lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes, emphasized the aggressiveness of the disease. The SALL4B-induced AML was also transplantable to immunodeficient mice. The results cannot be explained as a consequence of insertional effects by the following evidence. First, all six founders for SALL4B transgenic mice were analyzed, and they all exhibited a similar phenotype. Second, mice expressing the truncated N-terminal 356 amino acids of SALL4 were generated. No MDS or AML were seen in all six founders.\n\n\nMDS progression is driven by the expansion of a subset of primitive, self-renewing stem cells in our mouse mode\n\n\n[0283] To determine if the cellular defect contributing to the leukemic phenotype was at the stem-cell or progenitor-cell level, the HSC and HPC sub-populations were analyzed with correlation to disease progression in SALL4B transgenic mice. The total number of bone marrow cells was similar among the wild type (WT), pre-leukemic, and leukemic SALL4B transgenic groups. The percentages of both HSC and the HPC populations were elevated significantly for pre-leukemic or leukemic stages in SALL4B transgenic mice as compared to the WT control littermates (Fig. 18). To identify the source of LSCs, serial leukemic transplantations were performed using a NOD-SCID. First, the HSC and HPC sub-populations were sorted from primary leukemic SALL4B transgenic donor mice. The sorting was followed with transplantations into NOD-SCID mice. The leukemic phenotype was noticed in the recipients. We observed that the granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP) cells continued to expand in the transplanted leukemia (Fig. 19), becoming the only HPC population after the second transplantation. Similarly, the HSC population was elevated variably in the leukemic donor and its serial recipient mice. Both HSCs and GMP cells can give rise to the leukemic phenotype in the recipients thus indicating that both populations were LSCs. Moreover, BmUl, a gene that plays important roles in self-renewal of LSCs, has been associated with &4ZL4.B-induced LSCs.\n\n\n[0284] In summary, SALL4B transgenic mice exhibited excess blasts, ineffective hematopoiesis, and dysplasia in HSCs, which are all hallmarks of human MDS. Our model presents a novel theory: MDS progression is driven by the expansion of a subset of primitive, self-renewing stem cells.\n\n\nWEST\\21413\n05\n0.1 3\n56\n \nQ\n77-000029 \n\n SALL4 and Bmi-1 biochemical pathways in regulating LSC self-renewal properties\n\n\n[0285] To date, the polycomb gene Bmi-1 is the most studied gene in regulating LSC self-renewal properties. Knockout of Bmi-1 in mice results in a progressive loss of all hematopoietic lineages. This loss results from the inability of the Bmi-1\n\"\n stem cells to self renew. Bmi-1 \n\"\n cells display altered expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor genes pi 6\n0\n^\n43\n and pi 9\nARF\n resulting in the promotion of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis mainly through the activation of the pRb and p53 pathways. Introducing genes known to produce AML into Brni-1\n\"7\"\n HSCs induces AML with normal kinetics. Importantly, the Bmi- 1 \n\"\n \n\"\n LSCs from primary recipients are unable to produce AML in secondary recipients due to exhaustion of the Bmi-1\n\" \"\n LSCs. Similar to Bmi-1, SALL4B is highly expressed in HSCs and is down- regulated as differentiation proceeds. The expansion of stem compartments is accompanied with MDS and progression of MDS to AML associated with up-regulated expression of Bmi-1 in the SALL4B mouse model. In addition, our data have shown that the SALL4B gene is able to transactivate Bmi-1. By chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we have demonstrated that SALL4 can bind directly to the Bmi-1 promoter in a region involving SALL4 stimulation, further indicating that Bmi- l is a SALL4B downstream target that mediates LSC self-renewal.\n\n\nMassive apoptosis and significant growth arrest are induced by reducing SALL4 expression in cancer-specific cells\n\n\n[0286] To understand the function of SALL4 in leukemic cells, we have investigated the effect of SALL4 knockdown in an AML cell line, NB4. We applied siRNA to suppress SALL4 expression in the NB4 cell line. Two siRNA retroviral constructs that target different regions of the SALL4 mRNA were made, and their ability to reduce SALL4 mRNA in NB4 cells was confirmed by Q- RT-PCR. In both SALL4 siRNA constructs, down-regulation of SALL4 also significantly reduced Bmi-1 levels. As shown in Fig. 20, a 21-fold increase in caspase-3 activity — from 4.6 percent to 98.3 percent — was seen in WT cells for NB4 cells that reduced approximately 50 percent mRNA of the WT levels of SALL4 (Fig. 2OA and B). Caspase-3 is one of the key protein markers for the apoptosis pathway. Similar results were observed in other cancer cell lines, such as an embryonic carcinoma (EC) cell line and a chronic myeloid Leukemic cell line, KBM5 (data not shown). In addition, the S ALL4-induced caspase-3 activity was restored to a near normal level by overexpression of Bmi-1 (Fig. 20C). To further study the role of the SALL4 stem cell gene in cell growth, cell- cycle changes and cellular DNA synthesis were monitored in SALL4-suppressed NB4 cells and NB4 cells through BrdU, incorporation assay and FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting). NB4\n\n\nWliSTΩ 1413050.1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n cells that reduced SALL4 expression up to 50 percent showed about a four-fold decrease in S phase cells and a significant increase in the Gl and G2 phases (6 and 50-folds, respectively), which paralleled the drop in DNA synthesis as judged from the level of BrdU incorporation (Fig. 2OD and 20E). Similar results were observed in other cancer cell lines, such as NTERA2, an embryonic cancer cell line. In contrast, no significant change in the cell-cycle profile was observed when the NB4 cells were transduced with control viruses. To determine if restoration of Bmi-1 alone is sufficient to override decreased cell proliferation and cell-cycle arrest induced by SALL4 knockdown, Bmi-1 in SALL4-suppressed NB4 cells was restored by ectopically expressing Bmi-1. Restoration of Bmi-1 was sufficient to rescue decreased cell proliferation and cell-cycle arrest induced by a reduction of SALL4 (Fig. 20F). These results suggest that cell- cycle arrest and decreased cell proliferation in SALL4-knockdown NB4 cells could be accounted for by decreased expression of Bmi-1. This result is also consistent with Bmi-1 as a target gene of SALIA\n\n\n[0287] To determine if suppression of S ALL4 affects only the survival of cancer stem cells but not normal ES cells, the effect of SALL4 reduction on EC cells, NTERA2, which are malignant pluripotent stem cells, was compared with the effect on normal (ES) cells. Approximately 50 percent reduction of SALL4 led to significant EC cell apoptosis (10 fold increase) as determined by measuring caspase-3 activity and cell deaths by morphology, whereas no significant cell death or increased caspase-3 activity was observed in SALL4 ES cells.\n\n\n[0288] To study the effect of reduced SALL4 on bone marrow stem cells, a mouse SALL4\n+/\"\n was generated through homologous recombination. Approximately 50 percent heterozygous, SALL4 knock-out mice (SALL4\n+/~\n) survived despite the defect at the ES cell level. However, homozygous SALL4 mutant embryos died in very early gestation. Hematological analysis was performed on the surviving SALL4\n+/\"\n and WT control mice. Results showed that these heterozygous mice exhibited mild leukopenia in the peripheral blood. SALL4\n+ \"\n bone marrows were similar to those found in the WT controls. The immature HSCs/HPCs in SALL4\n+/\"\n mice were mildly decreased when compared with those in the WT controls (c-kit— positive population in WT mice: 17±1.8 percent, N=5 vs. SALL4\n+/\"\n: 13.9±0.9 percent, N=3). To determine the effect on HSC/HPC homozygous SALL4 mice, mice containing the conditional SALL4 allele(s) (floxed) were generated through homologous recombination.\n\n\nWESTV214I\n3\nO\n50\n. ! 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n [0289] In summary, since the reduction of SALL4 has a dramatic effect on the survival of EC cells but not normal ES cells, while not being bound by theory, it seems that SALL4 may serve as a survival factor to maintain growth and survival of cancer stem cells. These findings provide a foundation for developing a LSC-specific therapy targeting SALL4.\n\n\n[0290] LSCs are quite different from leukemic blast cells, and LSCs are not effectively killed by standard chemotherapy drugs. Consequently, even for patients who attain a remission, the LSCs generally are not destroyed and are considered to be responsible for subsequent relapses with the disease. SALL4 is an ESC gene and over expression of this gene in mice transforms HSCs/HPCs into LSCs associated with up-regulation of Bmi-1. Reduction of SALL4 triggers massive apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in AML cells associated with reduction in Bmi-1. These phenomenal responses can be rescued by restoring Bmi-1 to a relatively normal level (see above).\n\n\n[0291] Using a conditional SALL4 knockout, whether a loss or reduction in SALL4 triggers LSCs to undergo apoptosis can be determined and whether the elimination of the SALL4 LSC compartment within the leukemia clone is sufficient to cure the disease.\n\n\n[0292] To achieve this, SALL4\nflox/flox\n and SALL4 \nfloxΛ\n mice are crossed to poly I:C (interferon) -inducible MxlCre mice. The MxlCre mouse has been shown to induce high levels of Cre recombinase in almost all cell types in the marrow, including stem cells or very early progenitor cells. In this Cre system, the Cre recombinase transgene is under the control of the interferon-regulated promoter in such a manner that induction of Cre expression — achieved by injecting poly I:C — causes an excision of a critical exon from the target gene. Bone marrow cells from 5-FU (fluorouracil) -treated SALL4 \nflox/flox\n/Cre and SALL4 \nflox/+\n/Cre mice will be retro virally transduced with the Hoxa9-Meisl fusion gene and transplanted into a lethally irradiated recipient to generate the AML mouse model. Since LSCs in AML are similar to LSCs in MDS progression with increased leukemic blasts and because there is no mouse model available for MDS progression, we will focus on an AML mouse model.\n\n\n[0293] AML is demonstrated by a peripheral blood smear, and AML-bearing mice will be injected intraperitoneally with the interferon inducer polyinosinic-polycytidylic (pIpC) to excise the SALL4 gene. The deletion of S ALL4 will be monitored to slow the leukemia progression and change the phenotype or clinical presentation. Leukemic blasts will be counted by a peripheral blood smear. The lower leukemic blast number in the peripheral blood or bone marrow could\n\n\nWESTV21413050.1 3\n5\n6Q77-000029 \n\n indicate an exhaustion of SALL4\n\" \"\n or SALL4\n\"/+\n LSCs. FACS will be used to analyze leukemic blasts. The main reason for analyzing both SALL4\n\" \"\n and SALL4\n\" +\n LSCs, is because we anticipate a dose- response effect with SALL4 deletion on LSCs. To further evaluate a possible exhaustion of SALL4\n7\"\n or S ALL4\n\"/+\n LSCs, transplantation assays are performed. The AML cells derived from the bone marrow of SALL4\n7\"\n or SALL4\n\"/+\nmice will be transplanted into synergistic mice. Recipient mice will then be monitored over time for the development of AML. AML cells from SALL4\n7\"\n or SALL4\n\"/+\n mice will be analyzed for apoptosis and cell-cycle progression. Furthermore, the survival and growth characteristics of AML cells from SALL4\n\"7\"\n or SALL4\n\"/+\n will be monitored through long-term in vitro cultures.\n\n\n[0294] To correlate our preliminary studies on AML cells in vivo and in vitro, and whether the AML-inducing capacity of SALL4\n\"7\"\n or SALL4\n\"/+\n LSC can be rescued in vivo by the overexpression of Bmi-1 and restored to a normal function similar to WT will be determined.\n\n\n[0295] Lentiviruses that express Bmi-1 are prepared. Retroviral supernatants will be used to transduce SALL4\n\"A\n and SALL4\n\"/+\nAML HSCs/HPCs cells sorted from AML SALL4\n7\"\n or SALL4\n\"/+\n mouse marrows. GFP\n+\n (green fluorescent protein) and GFP\n\"\n cells will be FACS-purified. Bmi-1 expression will be assessed by RT-PCR assay. GFP\n+\n and GFP\n\"\n cells of SALL4\n'7\"\n AML HSCs/HPCs will be assayed for bone marrow transplantation and colony formation as previously described. If increased Bmi-1 restores the serf renewal ability of SALL4\n\"7\"\n AML HSCs/HPCs, then the GFP\n+\n cells will be transplantable and demonstrate increased replating in long-term culture.\n\n\n[0296] To address whether specifically targeting the SALL4 gene, it will be possible to preferentially induce apoptosis in the LSC population of whole organisms, an RCAS virus that facilitates delivery of siRNA into LSCs that express TVA is used. Mice are created that express the receptor for the subgroup A avian leukosis virus (ATV), specifically for HSCs and HPCs in SALL4B mice. This will be achieved by placing the gene which encodes this virus receptor (TVA) under the control of a promoter, scl, that is active only in HSCs and HPCs. SALL4B mice will be crossed to scl-TVA mice to generate SALL4B/scl-TVA mice. Therefore, all HSCs and HPCs of SALL4B/scl-TVA mice will express this receptor and be susceptible to infection by ATV, while other tissues cannot be infected because they lack the TVA receptor. LSCs of SALL4/scl MDS mice will express the ATV receptor since LSCs are transformed from HSCs and HPCs. TVA-based retroviral vectors have been successfully used in the development of cancer models with mice.\n\n\nWESTV21413050 1 356077-000029 \n\n [0297] MDS progression will be characterized after intravenous and intra-marrow injection of variable titers of RCANBP viruses carrying the SALL4 siRNA sequence (which silences the expression of SALL4).\n\n\n[0298] Oligonucleotides sequences will be inserted into the RCANBP(A)Hl vector, and the viruses will be produced in DF-I cells. As a negative control, a vector containing a scrambled siRNA sequence will be used. The virus will be tested to reduce SALL4 expression in leukemic cell lines. The extent of the reduction will be assessed at the RNA level using Q-PCR and at the protein level by western analysis. The effect on cell death will be determined by cell count. The efficacy and duration of SALL4 reduction will be determined, as well as the extent of induced cell death, following delivery into blood and marrow of SALL4/ scl-TVA MDS mice. When SALL4B/scl-TVA mice progress to AML or in early disease, as demonstrated by a peripheral blood smear, RCANBP Hl viruses carrying SALL4 siRNA will be administrated to mice to suppress SALL4 expression. The latency, penetrance, immunophenotype, and transformation of AML will be compared between three groups of mice: (a) SALL4B/scl-TVA mice with a control retrovirus, (b) SALL4B/scl-TVA mice with RCANBP Hl viruses carrying SALL4 siRNA, and (c) scl-TVA normal mice. In addition, the reduction of SALL4 as related to its functions in LSC vs. normal HSCs/HPCs through apoptosis, cell-cycle progression, long-term culture and bone marrow repopulation assays will be compared.\n\n\n[0299] Recent progress in MDS treatment has been reported for 5-azacytidine (5AC), the only drug approved by the FDA for retarding progression in all types of MDS disease. However, the median duration of response to 5AC is less than 18 months. Treatment of a leukemic cell line, NB4, with 5AC significantly suppressed SALL4 and its downstream target, Bmi-1, (Fig. 21). Therefore, while not being bound by theory, it seems that 5AC influences self renewal and proliferation of LSCs through inhibition OΪSALL4B expression thus retarding MDS progression. Recent studies have also demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors can effectively destroy stem cells in AML, a disease that is closely related to MDS progression. However, proteasome inhibitors produce extreme toxicity, which is unbearable for many patients. There may be an advantage to using both 5AC and proteasome inhibitors.\n\n\nExample 4: Dose-dependent activation of the Bmi-1 promoter by SALL4 isoforms\n\n\n[0300] Transgenic mice that constitutively over-express human SALL4B, one of the SALL4 isoforms, progress from normal through preleukemic stages (MDS) to acute myeloid leukemias\n\n\nWESTO 1413050 1 356077-000029 \n\n (AML). To search for specific gene targets of SALL4 in leukemogenesis, Affymetrix microarray hybridization (using Ul 33 chips) of SALL4B preleukemic bone marrow mRNA was performed and compared the data with that of control bone marrow. Bmi-1 was identified as one of genes whose expression was significantly increased.\n\n\n[0301] To examine the correlation between Bmi-1 expression and SALL4 expression, analysis of mouse Bmi-1 promoter activity was performed. A ~2.1kb sequence upstream of the translation start site was subcloned into the 5 '-end of the promoterless pGL3 -basic luciferase reporter plasmid. The SALL4 responsiveness of the Bmi-1 promoter then was evaluated through co-transfection of 0.25 μg of the Bmi-1 promoter construct and 0.04μg of Renilla Luciferase plasmid together with increasing ratios of the SALL4A or SALL4B expression constructs relative to the Bmi-1 promoter construct (0 to 2 ratios). As one increased the molar excess of the SALL4A or SALL4B construct, the Bmi-1 promoter was activated in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 22).\n\n\nMapping of the SALL4 functional site within the Bmi-1 promoter region by a luciferase reporter gene assay\n\n\n[0302] To define the minimal promoter sequence required to activate Bmi-1 by SALL4, transient co-transfection of S ALL4 was performed with a series of deleted DNA fragments encompassing the Bmi-1 promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene. The series of deleted promoter fragments used in the transfection is depicted in Fig. 23 A. Each promoter reporter construct of Bmi-1 was transiently co-transfected with the SALL4 isoforms into HEK-293 cells. High levels of activation by both S ALL4 isoforms were seen with constructs containing promoter sequences from 0 to -2102, 0 to -1254, 0 to -683 and 0 to -270. Removal of the upstream region between -270 and -168 lead to the inability of SALL4 isoforms to activate the Bmi-1 promoter, indicating the presence of a strong SALL4 activation site in this region. The SALL4 binding region (-270 to -168) then was deleted from the 0 to -1254 and 0 to -683 promoter fragments and two new Bmi-1 promoter constructs created. The luciferase activity of the resulting constructs (P 1254 and P683) was compared with activity in the WT promoter constructs with or without co-transfection of SALL4A or SALL4B in HEK-293 cells. There was no significant difference in luciferase activity between the Bmi-1 promoter mutants P 1254 and P683 and the WT promoter constructs in HEK-293 cells in the absence of SALL4. However, deletion of the -270 to -168 region abolished the activation of Bmi-1 by SALL4 when compared\n\n\nWESTΛ21413050 1 356077-000029 \n\n with that of the WT promoter constructs (Fig. 23B). These results indicate that the -270 to -168 region contains a functional site within the Bmi-1 promoter that is activated by the SALL4 oncogene.\n\n\nBinding of SALL4 proteins to the Bmi-1 promoter in vivo\n\n\n[0303] The myeloid stem cell line 32D expresses Bmi-1 but has very low levels of endogenous SALL4. Binding of SALL4 proteins to the Bmi-1 promoter in 32D cells was analyzed using ChiP assays. 32D cells were transfected with SALL4A and SALL4B cDNA constructs tagged with haemagluttin (HA). Chromatin was then extracted, sonicated and immunoprecipitated using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against an HA antibody. The forward and reverse primer sets (7+8 and 9+10) amplified strong 225 bp amplicons from the input sample (Fig. 24B, input lane) and immunoprecipitates (Fig. 24B, +lane). Immunoprecipitation reactions using preimmune serum show very little amplification of the Bmi-1 promoter construct in the immunoprecipitated DNA (Fig. 24B, -lane). All ChIP samples were tested for false positive PCR amplification by sequencing amplicon DNAs to ascertain the specificity of the SALL4 that bound to the cis-regulatory elements. The intensity of each PCR amplicon was also normalized against the ChIP input band to show the relative abundance of SALL4A that bound to the Bmi-1 promoter construct (Fig. 24C) by Quantitative real time PCR (QRT-PCR). The observed binding was specific, as essentially no signal was observed in parallel ChIP experiments using cells transfected by an empty vector (pcDNA3). This study indicated that a region between -450 to -1 of the Bmi-1 promoter could be a binding site for SALL4A, consistent with the previous luciferase promoter deletion experiments. As expected, SALL4B also demonstrated a similar binding distribution on the Bmi-1 promoter. These studies indicate that the -450 to -1 region of the Bmi-1 promoter has a functional site for activation by both SALL4 isoforms (Fig. 24C). That SALL4 was able to bind the cis-regulatory elements of Bmi-1 in embryonic stem cells, HEK 293 cells, an acute leukemic cell line (NB4), and two AML human samples including MO (FAB classification) and AML transformed from CML (chronic myeloid leukemia) using ChIP-on- ChIP assays was also demonstrated.\n\n\nSALL4 is able to affect the levels of endogenous Bmi-1 expression\n\n\n[0304] To verify regulation of Bmi-1 by SALL4, SALL4 expression was attenuated in a leukemic cell line, HL60, using siRNA-mediated knockdown. Three siRNA retroviral constructs that target different regions of the SALL4 mRNA were made, and their ability to knockdown\n\n\nWEST\\21413050.1 356077-000029 \n\n SALL4 mRNA in HL60 cells was confirmed by QRT-PCR. Cells from the HL-60 leukemia cell line were infected with the virus collected after 48 hr of transduction. Stable infected cells were identified under G418 selection. In all three SALL4 siRNA constructs, down regulation of SALL4 significantly reduced Bmi-1 levels (Fig. 25A). SALL4 mRNA levels were knocked down by more than 90%, and Bmi-1 expression was reduced by 75-85%.\n\n\n[0305] To gain further supporting evidence of Bmi-1 regulation by SALL4, we analyzed Sall4\n+/\"\n mice. Homozygous Sall4 mutant embryos die at very early gestation. Approximately 50% of heterozygous Sall4 knock out mice (Sall4+/-) survive despite the defect at the embryonic stem cell level. Bone marrow cells from mutant Sall4+/- and wild type Sall4+/+ mice were isolated. Quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) was performed to compare expression levels of Sall4 and Bmi-1. The heterozygous Sall4\n+/\"\n bone marrow cells had reduced SALL4 expression as expected. In addition, these heterozygous cells also had significantly reduced expression levels of Bmi-1 as compared to normal mouse bone marrow cells (Fig. 25B).\n\n\nIncreased expression of Bmi-1 in SALL4B transgenic mice associated with disease progression\n\n\n[0306] Transgenic mice that overexpress one of the SALL4 isoforms, SALL4B, exhibited MDS-like features and, subsequently, also exhibited AML transformation. In contrast to WT control mice, the mRNA expression for Bmi-1 was up regulated significantly in preleukemic bone marrows and leukemic blasts from SALL4B transgenic mice (Fig. 25C). Events associated with the progression of MDS and MDS transformation in SALL4B transgenic mice were associated with the up regulation of Bmi-1. Hemotopoetic stem cells (HSCs) and Granulocyte Macrophage Progenitor cells (GMPs) were isolated from three leukemic SALL4 transgenic mice and three non-leukemic SALL4 transgenic mice. Both leukemic HSCs and GMPs had much higher levels of Bmi-1 expression than observed in normal HSCs and GMPs by QRT-PCR. These values range from a two to a twenty fold increase. Variable SΛLL4B expression levels were observed in different founder mice but in each case the expression levels of Bmi-1 were correlated with the SALL4B expression levels in the HSC and GMP cell populations. In addition, SALL4 expression levels consistently increased as leukemia progresses due to expansion of HSCs and HPCs.\n\n\nWESTO 1413050 1 356077-000029 \n\n Expression of high levels of SALL4 expression in human AML is associated with the expression of high levels of Bmi-1\n\n\n[0307] 12 random clinical AML samples from bone marrows were analyzed using QRT- PCR to quantify relative mRNA expression of SALL4 and Bmi-1 (Fig. 26). Ten out of 12 AML samples showed significant SALL4 expression ranging from a 3.93- to 653-fold increase relative to the averaged normal controls. These results were consistent with SALL4 protein expression as demonstrated by immunostaining with a SALL4 antibody. Interestingly, the same 10 out of 12 AML samples showed high levels of Bmi-1 expression ranging from a 1.10- to 22-fold increase. There was a strong correlation between the SALL4 and Bmi-1 expression in the AML samples that were examined.\n\n\nEpi genetic alterations at Bmi-1 gene promoter induced by SALL4 protein\n\n\n[0308] As shown above, SALL4 binds to the Bmi-1 promoter and the regulation of Bmi-1 by SALL4 has been noted in both in vitro and in vivo models of SALL4. H3-K4 trimethylation and H3-K79 methylation have been reported to couple directly to the transcriptional activation. Abnormal H3-K4 trimethylation and H3-K79 are associated also with leukemogenesis. ChIP analysis was performed on the 32D cells, which express no detectable endogenous SALL4, to analyze histone marks present on chromatin before SALL4 binds to the Bmi-1 promoter. ChIP analysis was then performed on 32D cells that had been transfected with SALL4A constructs tagged with HA, or a control vector, and then immunoprecipitated through ChIP using antibodies specific for histone H3-K4 trimethylation and H3-K79 dimethylation. DNAs recovered from these ChIP experiments were amplified by Q-PCR using primers that covered 1.5kb of the Bmi-1 promoter. Consistent with binding of SALL4 to Bmi-1 promoter sites in the 32D cells transfected with SALL4A or SALL4B constructs, H3-K4 trimethylation was detected and increased roughly 2-3 folds as compared to a vector control (Fig. 27). Similar analysis with H3- K79 methylation revealed robust methylation at SALL4 binding sites and closely paralleled the pattern of H3-K4 trimethylation in the presence of SALL4.\n\n\nExample 5: SALL4 is expressed only in spermatogonia of the testis\n\n\n[0309] SALL4 is a stem cell gene acting as a gatekeeper in control of early embryonic development. Expression of SALL4 is down-regulated when ESCs are triggered to differentiate and is completely suppressed in normal somatic cells of differentiated tissues. The presence of\n\n\nWEST\\214130\n5\n0.1 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n SALL4 was tested by immunohistochemistry in the testis using an antibody against SALL4. A strong nuclear staining was found in the primordial germ cells of the testis, spermatogonia, whereas the later developmental stages of spermatozoa in seminiferous tubules were negative. In addition, Sertoli cells, leydig cells, and other supporting cells were SALL4 negative.\n\n\nSALL4 is a biomarker for GCTs\n\n\n[0310] Immunohistochemistry staining of various GCTs was done using an anti-SALL4 antibody. The results are summarized in Table 5.\n\n\nTable 4. Results of immunohistochemistry staining from various tissue samples.\n\n\n[0311] Greater than 90% of nuclei in all malignant GCTs stained positive for SALL4. Negative staining samples had scattered positive staining cells, but they amounted to less than 1% of the total cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0312] Both classic and spermatocytic seminomas (n = 5) stained positive for SALL4. Many non-seminomas also stained positive for SALL4 including embryonal carcinomas (n = 5), yolk sac tumors (n = 5), and immature teratomas (n = 5). All positive samples showed strong staining with the SALL4 antibody that was localized specifically to the nucleus of the cells. Negative staining, defined as tissues which had less than 2% of the cells staining positive for SALL4, only occurred in the mature teratoma (n = 5). In each case greater than 90% of the tumor cell nuclei were positive with little to no background staining.\n\n\n[0313] SALL4 expression was further investigated in spermatocytic seminomas. The intensity of staining in spermatocytic seminomas appeared to be similar to the staining of spermatogonia\n\n\nWEST\\214130\n50\n. l 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n in normal testicular tissue. The analysis showed SALL4 to be one of most informative immunohistochemistry markers in identifying GCTs. The data also indicate that testis stem cells, the spermatogonia, are the testicular GCTs of origin.\n\n\nAnalysis of SALL4 immunohistochemistry on multi-tumor tissue array\n\n\n[0314] SALL4 is expressed in very early ESCs, and GCTs are reported to arise from the transformation of these cells. To determine if SALL4 protein can be detected in tumors other than GCTs, immunohistochemistry for SALL4 was performed using a tissue array bearing a variety of epithelial tumor tissues. For comparison samples of normal tissue were placed on the array. All samples of lung (n = 10), colon (n = 10), breast (n = 10), and ovarian (n = 10) cancers were classified as staining negatively for S ALL4. However, each of these tissues showed intermittent cells with a positive SALL4 nuclear signal in less than 2% of the cells. The normal adult control tissue samples (lung, heart, breast) all stained negative for S ALIA again with about 2% showing a positive nuclear staining. In samples of breast carcinoma, expression of SALL4 protein was observed both in small clusters of cells and scattered individual cells. The observed presence of a small number of S ALL4-expressing cells in the non-hematopoietic tissues is consistent with our previous finding that SALL4 is expressed in normal hematopoietic stem cells of the bone marrow at a similar low frequency.\n\n\nDecreased SALL4 expression during NTERA2 cell differentiation\n\n\n[0315] Since SALL4 is a key regulator of self-renewal in ESCs, the expression of SALL4 in NTERA2 cells, an embryonic carcinoma cell line, was analyzed before and after treatment with retinoic acid, a known inducer of differentiation in embryonic carcinoma cells. Retinoic acid treatment resulted in a significant reduction in SALL4 expression (Fig. 28) as well as its downstream target, Bmi-1. To determine the differentiation status of these cells, we assayed by Q-RT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) for expression of markers that represent lineage-specific cell differentiation. When NTERA2 cells were treated with 5 um retinoic acid for 24-48 hrs predominately an up-regulation of a panel of ectoderm markers was observed (Fig. 28A). In addition, some endodermal, mesodermal, and trophectodermal genes were also up-regulated. After 48 hours of retinoic acid treatment, SALL4 expression and its downstream target, Bmi-1, were significantly reduced when compared with untreated NTREA2 cells (Fig. 28B).\n\n\nWEST\\21413050.1 3\n5\n6077-0000\n2\n9 \n\n Induction of caspase-3 activity by reduction of SALL4 expression in NTERA2 cells\n\n\n[0316] Aberrant expression of SALL4 in hematopoietic stem cells or hematopoietic progenitor cells results in expansion of these cells leading to AML transformation. To understand the function of SALL4 in GCTs, the effect of SALL4 knockdown in NTERA2 cells transduced was investigated with SALL4 siRNA (small interfering ribonucleic acid) retroviruses. Two siRNA retroviral constructs that target different regions of the SALL4 mRNA were made, and their ability to reduce S ALL4 mRNA in NTERA2 cells was confirmed by Q-RT-PCR. In both SALL4 siRNA constructs, down-regulation of SALL4 also significantly reduced Bmi-1 levels (Fig. 29A). SALL4 mRNA and Bmi-1 mRNA levels were reduced by more than 90%. In addition, these SALL4 siRNA treated NTERA2 cells appeared to grow slowly and they were unable to differentiate further (Fig. 29B). To determine if reduction of SALL4 expression in NTERA2 cells lead to apoptosis, we measured the level of caspase-3, one the key protein markers for the apoptosis pathway. The level of caspase-3 induced by S ALL4 knockdown, was measured by flow cytometry. In NTERA2 cells that retained 10% of the wild-type (WT) levels of SALL4, there was a 12-fold increase of caspase-3 activity to 64.5% from 4.1 % in WT cells (Fig 30A and 30B). Similar results were observed in other cancer cell lines, such as NB4, an AML cell line.\n\n\nIncreased caspase-3 activity caused by decreased SALL4 is fully rescued by overexpression of Bmi-1\n\n\n[0317] To determine if overexpression of Bmi-1 could rescue SALL4-induced caspase-3 activity, S ALL4 siRNA treated NTERA2 cells were transfected with an expression vector containing BMI- 1. The levels of caspase-3 activity were then measured by flow cytometry. As shown in figure 3 c, SALL4-induced caspase-3 activity was restored to a near normal level by overexpression of BMI-1. However, overexpression of Bmi-1 has little effect on caspase-3 activity in WT NTERA2 cells (Fig. 30D).\n\n\nSALL4 knockdown leads to significantly decreased cell proliferation and cell-cycle arrest\n\n\n[0318] To further study the role of the SALL4 stem gene in cell growth, cell-cycle changes and cellular DNA synthesis were monitored in SALL4-reduced NTERA2 cells and NTERA2 cells through (BrdU) incorporation assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). SALL4 knockdown in NTERA2 cells resulted in G\n0\nZG\n1\n phase (27%) and G2 phase (37.9%) arrest (Fig.\n\n\nWEST\\214130\n50\n.l 3\n5\n6077-000029 \n\n31B). About a two-fold decrease in S phase cells was also observed, which paralleled the drop in DNA synthesis as judged from the level of BrdU incorporation. Similar results were observed in other cancer cell lines, such as NB4, an AML cell line. In contrast, no significant change in the cell-cycle profile was observed when the WT-NTERA2 cells (which express significant amounts of SALL4) were transduced with control viruses (Fig 31A).\n\n\nRestoration of Bmi-1 is sufficient to rescue decreased cell proliferation and cell-cycle arrest induced by a reduction of S ALL4\n\n\n[0319] To determine if restoration of Bmi-1 alone is sufficient to override decreased cell proliferation and cell-cycle arrest induced by SALL4 knockdown, Bmi-1 was restored in SALL4-deleted NTERA2 cells by ectopically expressing Bmi-1. The re-expression of Bmi-1 in S ALL4-deleted NTERA2 cells resulted in an increase in the S phase population and a decrease in the Gl and G2 phases as determined through FACS analysis (Fig 31C). In addition, as shown in the BrdU labeling assay, SALL4-depleted cells that restored Bmi-1 to a normal level incorporated BrdU significantly in a similar manner as the WT NTERA2 cells (Fig. 31 C). These results suggest that cell-cycle arrest and decreased cell proliferation in SALL4-depleted NTERA2 cells could be accounted for by decreased expression of Bmi-1. However, overexpression of Bmi-1 has little effect on cell cycle and proliferation in WT NTERA2 cells (Fig. 3 ID) and this might be due to the fact that WT NTERA2 cells already bear high levels of Bmi-1.\n\n\nWEST\\21\n4\n130\n5\n0.1 350077-000029 \n\n References\n\n\n1.

The present invention is also directed to a biological conjugate comprising proteins having the above protein sequences and a binding moiety covalently bound to the cysteine-containing tag in the protein. The present invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing the biological conjugates in combination with selected therapeutic, diagnostic, or research entities, and methods of administering the pharmaceutical compositions to a patient to achieve targeted delivery of the therapeutic, diagnostic, or research entities in the patient.\n\n\n2. Description of the Related Art\n\n\nConjugation of recombinant proteins to various entities is used in several areas. One area is targeted delivery of therapeutic, diagnostic, and research agents to targeted cells in the patient in order to improve their efficacy and to minimize potentially adverse side effects. In this area either therapeutic, diagnostic, and research agents, or their carriers are chemically conjugated to recombinant targeting proteins that can selectively bind to targeted cells (reviewed by Dubowchik & Walker, 1999). The resulting conjugates are structurally and functionally heterogeneous because they are formed randomly via chemical reactions with few of several available chemical groups, usually E-amino groups of lysine residues, in the targeting protein. Since random conjugation does not discriminate between functionally important and dispensable amino acid residues in the targeting protein, the procedure should be custom-developed and optimized on a case-by-case basis in order to increase the proportion of functionally active proteins.\n\n\nAnother area is derivatizing artificial surfaces and/or bulk compositions of biomedical devices or tissue scaffolds with proteins that target certain components of intra-organism environment in order to improve surface compatibility with the environment and to modulate the desired features, such as affinity or rejection of certain intra-organism components. In this area recombinant proteins are covalently grafted on the material through random chemical conjugation, usually via ε-amino groups of lysine residues, that involves both functionally important and dispensable amino acid residues in the proteins, resulting in heterogeneous products with unknown fraction of functionally active proteins.\n\n\nYet another area with similar problems is construction of various biosensors or other functional devices with protein-derivatized surfaces that convert the results of interactions between the “working” protein and the targeted components of the environment into a detectable output, including but not limited to a detectable signal or the products of enzymatic activity of immobilized proteins. In this area recombinant proteins are also chemically conjugated to artificial surfaces of these devices usually via ε-amino groups of lysine residues, yielding heterogeneous surfaces with unknown fraction of functionally active proteins.\n\n\nSeveral methods for chemical conjugation of proteins to artificial surfaces have been developed (see, for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,492,840 to Malmqvuist; 5,853,744 to Mooradian et al.; 6,033,719 to Keogh, Mann et al. (2001); Kuhl & Griffith-Cima, (1996); Bentz et al. (1998). These methods were developed on a case-by-case basis in order to minimize damage to the protein and to increase the homogeneity of the surface.\n\n\nThese problems are well recognized, and over the years several approaches have been developed for introduction into recombinant proteins of unique cysteine residues for site-specific conjugation of various entities. This strategy is based on observation that intrinsic cysteine residues in proteins are usually involved in intramolecular or inter-subunit disulfide bonds and are not readily available for chemical conjugation. In theory, introduction of a unique cysteine residue that does not affect formation of intrinsic disulfide bonds and does not affect functional activity of the recombinant protein can provide a thiol group available for site-specific conjugation via chemistries known in art. For example, several groups reported introduction of cysteines into recombinant single-chain Fv antibody fragments (scFv), usually at or near C-termini, in order to use these cysteine residues for formation of diabodies and/or for site-specific conjugation to various entities (Adams et al., 1993; Kipriyanov et al., 1994; Wang et al., 1997; Marti et al., 2001; Gupta et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2002; Li et al., 2002; Renard et al., 2002; Albrecht et al., 2004). However, even for scFv, the presence of unpaired cysteine at or near the C-terminus significantly affects protein yield, solubility and functional activity (Schmiedl et al., 2000). Futami et al. (2000) introduced cysteine residues near the N- and C-termini of into human RNase I which resulted in a stabilized RNase I. However, yield and enzymatic activity of the product were significantly reduced. Moreover, this mutant RNase I or its fragments were not used in other products.\n\n\nAnother method for site directed modification of proteins is intein-mediated ligation of various entities to the C-terminus of the protein (see, for example Evans et al., 1999; Tolbert and Wong 2000; Macmillan et al., 2000; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2001; Hofinann, and Muir, 2002; Lovrinovic et al., 2003; Wood et al., 2004). However application of this method require proper folding of the protein fused to a large intein domain and the ability to withstand fairly harsh reducing conditions during intein-mediated ligation. Furthermore, in both approaches discussed above, conjugation to available cysteine residue is limited to entities that do not interfere with activities of the protein despite their close proximity to the body of the protein.\n\n\nThus, in the area of protein-based targeted delivery of therapeutic, diagnostic, and research compounds, as well as in the area of construction of various devices and scaffolds with protein-derivatized surfaces, what is needed in the art are compositions and general methods that (1) allow for site-specific conjugation of recombinant proteins to various entities in order to produce more homogeneous products in ways that minimize interference with functional activities of said proteins; (2) readily convert various recombinant proteins of interest into a format suitable for site-specific conjugation; (3) can be utilized with a wide variety of entities to which a recombinant protein of interest need to be conjugated; and (4) do not result in immunogenic or toxicity problems when introduced into humans. The present invention is believed to be an answer to these objectives.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention is directed to an isolated polypeptide, consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention is directed to an isolated nucleic acid consisting of a nucleic acid sequence that encodes the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:2.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention is directed to an isolated polypeptide, comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO:4.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention is directed to an isolated nucleic acid comprising a sequence that encodes the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:4.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention is directed to an isolated polypeptide having an amino acid sequence comprising the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 and the polypeptide sequence of a selected targeting protein.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention is directed to an isolated nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:6, 8, 10, 12, or 14.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention is directed to a biological conjugate, comprising: (a) a targeting moiety comprising a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence comprising the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 and the polypeptide sequence of a selected targeting protein; and (b) a binding moiety; the biological conjugate having a covalent bond between the thiol group of SEQ ID NO:2 and a functional group in the binding moiety.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention is directed to a biological conjugate, comprising: (a) a targeting moiety comprising a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence comprising the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 and the polypeptide sequence of a selected targeting protein; and (b) a binding moiety that comprises an adapter protein bound covalently to the targeting moiety, the adapter protein having a thiol group; the biological conjugate having a disulfide bond between the thiol group of SEQ ID NO:2 and the thiol group of the adapter protein.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition for selectively delivering selected entities to a target in a patient, comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; and one or another of the above biological conjugates.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of selectively delivering entities to a target in a patient, comprising the steps of: (a) administering to a patient the above pharmaceutical composition; and (b) permitting the biological conjugate to contact the target to deliver the entity to the target in the patient.\n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\nThe invention will be more fully understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n is a representation of amino acid and nucleic acid sequences of C4-tag genetically fused to multiple cloning site region via a G4S linker (Panel A), and a schematic representation of a plasmid for bacterial expression of fusion recombinant proteins fused to C4-tag via a G4S linker (Panel B);\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n is a schematic representation of site-specific conjugation between C4-tagged fusion recombinant protein and a complimentary adapter protein, named HuS(C118) (Panel A), a schematic representation of a family of adapter proteins based on human RNase I capable of site-specific conjugation to cysteine residue in C4-tag genetically fused to recombinant protein (Panel B), a demonstration of spontaneous conjugation via a disulfide bond between C4-VEGF and HuS(C118) leading to appearance of DTT-sensitive new protein bands in samples named HuS-C4-VEGF on the SDS-PAGE gel (Panel C), and a demonstration that ribonuclease activity is reconstituted upon chemical conjugate formation, but not upon physical mixing of adapter protein with C4-tagged recombinant fusion protein (Panel D).\n\n\n \nFIG. 3\n illustrates that functional activities of several C4-tagged recombinant fusion proteins and C4-tagged recombinant fusion proteins conjugated to complimentary adapter protein are comparable to that of parental proteins.

Current conjugation methods known in the art rely mostly on random cross-linking of various entities to amino acid residues, such as, for example, lysine or tyrosine, that are abundant in the protein. Less abundant cysteine residues are usually involved in intramolecular disulfide bonds essential for the functional activity of the protein and therefore not available for conjugation. As a result, even when conjugation involves only one amino acid residue per protein, the final product contains a mixture of proteins modified at different positions and therefore heterogeneous in their activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic, and tissue distribution characteristics. Furthermore, conjugation to amino acid residues in the protein is always limited by the harm it may inflict upon the functional activity of the proteins. As a result, conjugation procedures have to be custom-developed on a case-by-case basis. However, customized conjugation does not allow a standardized approach to rapid adaptation of different proteins for similar purposes, for example for a targeted delivery of the same imaging reagent, or surface derivatization of the same device.\n\n\nTo overcome these and other obstacles, the present invention discloses compositions and methods useful for site-specific conjugation of recombinant proteins to various entities. The method is based on conversion of a protein of interest into a fusion protein that comprises a cysteine-containing peptide tag, named C4, fused via a linker peptide to an N-terminus or a C-terminus of the protein of interest. By definition, in order to be useful, such fusion proteins should retain its functional activities, and a cysteine residue in the peptide tag should be available for site-specific conjugation with various entities, including complimentary adapter proteins, capable of forming a covalent disulfide bond with tag's cysteine. Various chemistries for conjugation to a cysteine thiol group are well-known in art. For example, entities derivatized with maleimide groups, or vinylsulfone groups, or with chemically activated thiol groups can be conjugated to a thiol group in C4-tag. On the other hand, thiol group in the C4-tag can be modified with formation of an activated disulfide bond that might react with available thiol groups on various entities, or it can be modified with bifunctional reagents for conjugation to entities that can react with the second functional group.\n\n\nThus, it has now been discovered that a cysteine-containing peptide fusion C4-tag can confer upon a protein fused to the tag the ability to be chemically conjugated to various chemical components. The cysteine residue of the C4 tag is used to form a covalent bond to the chemical components, thus providing a strong, stable linkage. Through the cysteine residue of C4, stable bonds may be formed between the C4 tagged protein and a wide variety of entities, including drugs, drug carriers, contrast agents, carriers for contrast agents, radionuclides, carriers for radionuclides, various nano- and microparticles, including liposomes, quantum dots, small and ultra-small paramagnetic particles, other proteins or protein fragments, nucleic acids, various protein-modifying molecules, including but not limited to polyethyleneglycol of various molecular weights, as well as surfaces of various devices, such as biomedical devices, biosensors, or artificial tissue scaffolds. In one embodiment, a complimentary adapter protein is covalently bonded to the C4 tagged protein through a disulfide bond. The adapter protein can be used a platform for conjugation to various entities described above. The present invention discloses that C4-tagged proteins retain protein functional activity and can be site-specifically conjugated to various entities without loss of functional activity either in vitro or in vivo.\n\n\nThe formation of a covalent bond offers several advantages for the present invention. First, the entity covalently bound to C4-tag is removed from the functional parts of the protein. Furthermore, a complimentary adapter protein allows further distancing of bound entities from the functional parts of the protein. Second, the covalent bond is strong such that the materials bound to the C4 tagged protein do not easily dissociate in biological fluids or in solutions. Third, the chemistry and conditions to form the covalent bond known and can be easily reproduced. Fourth, under certain conditions known to those of skill in the art, it is possible to destroy the covalent linkage and permit the components to dissociate. For example, if a disulfide bond is formed, appropriate conditions can be selected to reduce this bond and permit the C4-tagged protein to dissociate. This feature of the invention offers advantages in that, for example, that derivatized surfaces can be regenerated after a predetermined length of time.\n\n\nUnless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in art to which the subject matter herein belongs.\n\n\nAs used herein, “C4”, refers to a mutant N-\nterminal\n 15 amino acid long fragment of human RNase I with the following nucleic acid and amino acid sequences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 1)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAAGAATCTTGCGCTAAAAAATTTCAACGTCAACACATGGACTCT\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 2)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLys-Glu-Ser-Cys-Ala-Lys-Lys-Phe-Gln-Arg-Gln-His-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMet-Asp-Ser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough minimally altered human peptides are not expected to be immunogenic in humans and therefore are preferred embodiments of cysteine-containing tags, it is understood that in some applications immunogenicity is not an issue, and therefore these peptides may be used as modified by amino acid substitutions, amino acid deletions, amino acid insertions, and amino acid additions, including placing of cysteine residue in different positions in these peptides or using corresponding fragments from non-human ribonucleases.\n\n\nAs used herein, “targeting protein” refers to a protein that can selectively interact with cellular receptors or other cell surface proteins, or can selectively interact with certain components of the environment, either free or bound to a surface.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “linker sequence” refers to an innocuous length of nucleic acid or protein that joins two other sections of nucleic acid or protein.\n\n\nThe terms “mutant” and “mutated” refer to nucleic acid or protein sequences which are not found in nature.

This polypeptide sequence, which is a genetic fusion of C4 and a single chain VEGF (scVEGF) having the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:4, is encoded by the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:13. Due to the redundancy of the genetic code, however, any nucleic acids that code for SEQ ID NO:14 is embraced by the nucleic acids of the present invention. Although scVEGF contains 16 cysteine residues per single-chain molecule, C4-tagged molecules are refolded into functionally active conformation, whereby the cysteine residue in C4-tag can be conjugated to various entities yielding conjugates with functional activities comparable to that of unmodified VEGF.\n\n\nAs indicated above, in one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a biological conjugate, comprising: (a) a targeting moiety comprising a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence comprising the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 and the polypeptide sequence of a selected targeting protein; and (b) a binding moiety; wherein the biological conjugate has a covalent bond between the thiol group of SEQ ID NO:2 and a functional group in the binding moiety. The present invention is also directed to a biological conjugate, comprising: (a) a targeting moiety comprising a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence comprising the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 and the polypeptide sequence of a selected targeting protein; and (b) a binding moiety that comprises an adapter protein bound covalently to the targeting moiety, the adapter protein having a thiol group; wherein the biological conjugate has a disulfide bond between the thiol group of SEQ ID NO:2 and the thiol group of the adapter protein. Each of these components are discussed in more detail below.\n\n\nThe targeting moiety is preferably a protein having a polypeptide comprising the C4 peptide and a targeting protein. As indicated above, the C4 peptide portion of the targeting moiety is a mutant N-\nterminal\n 15 amino acid long fragment of human RNase I wherein arginine at \nposition\n 4 has been substituted with cysteine. This particular peptide offers several advantages in the present invention. The human origin decreases the likelihood of inducing a strong immune response in a human host. Furthermore, an N-terminal fragment of human RNase I is capable of forming an α-helix that may protect it from forming disulfide bonds with other cysteine residues in the fusion protein during refolding and purification of the protein. Finally, enzymatically inactive wild type N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of human RNase I spontaneously form enzymatically active non-covalent complexes, a phenomenon that is exploited in the present invention for developing of complimentary adapter proteins, capable of forming disulfide bond with C4 residue in C4-tag. The mutant N-\nterminal\n 15 amino acid long fragment of human RNase I has the following nucleic acid and amino acid sequences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 1)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAAGAATCTTGCGCTAAAAAATTTCAACGTCAACACATGGACTCT\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 2)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLys-Glu-Ser-Cys-Ala-Lys-Lys-Phe-Gln-Arg-Gln-His-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMet-Asp-Ser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe targeting protein portion of the targeting moiety is any protein that can selectively bind to cellular receptors or other cell surface proteins or selectively interact with certain components of the environment, and is genetically fused to the C4 peptide. In preferred embodiments, the targeting protein may be human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), or a mutated or truncated form thereof such as VEGF\n110\n, human annexin V, or a mutated or truncated form thereof, a catalytically inactive fragment of anthrax lethal vector, or a mutated or truncated form thereof, or a single chain VEGF derivative, or a mutated or truncated form thereof.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the targeting moiety has the polypeptide sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS: 6 or 8. These polypeptide sequences, which are genetic fusions of C4 and VEGF\n121 \nor VEGF\n110\n, respectively, are coded by the nucleic acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS:5 and 7, respectively. Due to the redundancy of the genetic code, however, any nucleic acids that code for SEQ ID NOS:6 or 8 are embraced by the nucleic acids of the present invention. In addition, although selected isoforms of VEGF (VEGF\n121\n) contains 18 cysteine residues per dimeric molecule, tagged molecules are refolded into functionally active conformation, whereby cysteine residue in C4-tag can be conjugated to various entities yielding conjugates with functional activities comparable to that of unmodified VEGF.\n\n\nVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) controls growth of endothelial cells via interaction with several receptors, among which KDR/flk-1 (VEGFR-2) receptor expression is limited mostly to endothelial cells. In adult organisms the growth of endothelial cells (angiogenesis) occurs, with the exception of corpus luteum development, only in various pathological conditions. Thus, KDR/flk-1 (VEGFR-2) receptor-mediated delivery of therapeutic, diagnostic, contrast, and research entities site-specifically linked to VEGF or scVEGF, or linked to VEGF or scVEGF via a complimentary adapter protein, may be useful in therapies for various pathologies. On the other hand, long-circulating, or slow-releasable from a suitable matrix, site-specifically PEGylated VEGF or scVEGF, as well as VEGF or scVEGF conjugated to the surfaces of biomedical devices, such as stents, or tissue scaffolds, might be useful for promotion of angiogenesis in ischemic situations.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the targeting moiety has the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:10. This polypeptide sequence, which is a genetic fusion of C4 and annexin V, is encoded by the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:9. Due to the redundancy of the genetic code, however, any nucleic acids that code for SEQ ID NO:10 is embraced by the nucleic acids of the present invention. Although annexin V contains a single cysteine residue, tagged molecules are refolded into functionally active conformation, whereby the cysteine residue in C4-tag can be conjugated to various entities yielding conjugates with functional activities comparable to that of unmodified annexin V. Annexin V interacts with phosphatidylserine exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells, and is used as an early marker of apoptotic process. Thus, phosphatidylserine-mediated delivery of therapeutic, diagnostic, or research entities site-specifically linked to annexin V might be useful for inhibition or promotion of apoptosis.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the targeting moiety has the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:12. This polypeptide sequence, which is a genetic fusion of C4 and a catalytically inactive fragment of anthrax lethal factor, known as LFn, is encoded by the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:11. Due to the redundancy of the genetic code, however, any nucleic acids that code for SEQ ID NO:12 is embraced by the nucleic acids of the present invention. Although LFn contains no cysteine residues, tagged molecules are refolded into functionally active conformation, whereby the cysteine residue in C4-tag can be conjugated to various entities yielding conjugates with functional activities comparable to that of unmodified LFn. Catalytically inactive fragment of anthrax lethal factor, LFn, pairs with another anthrax protein, named protective antigen (PA) that interacts with the same cellular receptors as the combination of catalytically active lethal factor/protective antigen (LF/PA). Thus, PA-mediated delivery of therapeutic, diagnostic, or research entities site-specifically linked to LFn might be useful for mapping sites with receptors for PA, or delivery to cells compounds that might interfere with cytotoxic activity of lethal factor.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the targeting moiety has the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:14. This polypeptide sequence, which is a genetic fusion of C4 and a single chain VEGF (scVEGF) having the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:4, is encoded by the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:13. Due to the redundancy of the genetic code, however, any nucleic acids that code for SEQ ID NO:14 is embraced by the nucleic acids of the present invention. As indicated above, scVEGF comprises two 3 to 112 amino acid residue fragments of the VEGF\n121 \nisoform connected head-to-tail into a single-chain protein via alanine residue. Although scVEGF contains 16 cysteine residues per single-chain molecule, tagged molecules are refolded into functionally active conformation, whereby the cysteine residue in C4-tag can be conjugated to various entities yielding conjugates with functional activities comparable to that of unmodified dimeric VEGF.\n\n\nWith reference to the above targeting moiety, a linker sequence may be positioned between the C4 peptide and the sequence of the targeting protein. Linker sequences, such as Gly\n4\nSer or (Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nlinkers, are engineered in the commercially available vectors for bacterial expression of recombinant proteins and can be readily engineered into vectors for expression of recombinant proteins in other hosts, including, but not limited to mammalian cells, insect cells, yeast cells, and transgenic organisms. Linkers serve to provide some useful distance between the C4 peptide and the targeting protein. Although in the presented embodiments C4-tag is positioned at the N-terminus of targeting protein, one skilled in the art would appreciate that the tag may be placed at the C-terminus of the targeting protein, or inside the functionally dispensable area of targeting protein, for example between two functional domains of single-chain antibody, using commonly known methods of genetic engineering.\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n, Panel A, shows amino acid and nucleic acid sequences of C4-tag genetically fused to a multiple cloning site region found in the typical expression plasmid via a G\n4\nS linker. As shown in Panel A of \nFIG. 1\n, the full nucleic acid sequence includes control and transcription elements (T7 promotor, lac operatior, ribosome binding site, and the like) as well as the nucleic acid sequence of the C4 tag. A linker sequence separates the C4 sequence from a multiple cloning site, which may be used to introduce nucleic acids of interest that will function as the targeting protein. A T7 termination site completes the full length nucleic acid. \nFIG. 1\n, Panel B, shows a schematic representation of a plasmid for bacterial expression of fusion recombinant proteins fused to C4-tag via a G4S linker.\n\n\nThe targeting moiety of biological conjugate may be cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, antibodies and their fragments, enzymes, and combinations of thereof that may be useful in various biomedical or industrial applications. The binding moiety portion of the biological conjugate may be any substance or surface that can be covalently bound to the C4-thiol group of targeting moiety or to functional group of adapter protein in the adapter/targeting moiety conjugate. Examples of useful binding moieties include, but are not limited to, drugs, radionuclide chelators, polyethylene glycol, dyes, lipids, liposomes, and selected surfaces.\n\n\nUseful radionuclide chelators include compounds such as 5-maleimido-2-hydraziniumpyridine hydrochloride (HYNIC) for loading with imaging or therapeutic radionuclide. Polyethylene glycol is useful for slowing blood clearance of protein, and may be used in a derivatized (e.g., modified with maleimide or vinylsulfone) or underivatized forms. Useful dyes include, for example, cyanine dye Cy5.5 for near-infrared fluorescent imaging. Surfaces that may bind to the C4-thiol group of targeting moiety or to functional group of adapter protein in the adapter/targeting moiety conjugate include surfaces of a nano- or microparticle, the surface of a dendrimer, surfaces of tissue culture scaffolds, biomedical devices, and biosensors. It is understood that when a binding entity include surface, it may be used as such, or may have other chemical groups deposited on the surface by methods known in art. These chemical groups might be further used for modification with bifunctional reagents that allow conjugation to C4-tag or to adapter protein via methods known in art.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the biological conjugate has a covalent bond between the thiol group of the C4 peptide (SEQ ID NO:2), and a naturally occurring functional group in the binding moiety. Thus, it is contemplated that the thiol group of the C4 peptide reacts chemically directly with a reactive group in the binding moiety such that a stable covalent bond is formed. In alternative embodiments, the reactive group that reacts with the thiol group of the C4 peptide may be introduced artificially, for example by using bifunctional crosslinking agents known in art. For example, a maleimide group can be introduced into polyethylene glycol or a lipid and used for reaction with the thiol group of the C4 peptide.\n\n\nIn an alternative embodiment, the biological conjugate of the present invention includes a binding moiety that comprises adapter protein bound covalently to the targeting moiety. In general, the adapter protein is a mutant human RNase I, or a fragment thereof, that includes cysteine at position 118 (Cys\n118\n). Examples of adapter proteins useful in the present invention include proteins having polypeptide sequences shown in SEQ ID NO:16, SEQ ID NO:18, SEQ ID NO:20, and SEQ ID NO:22, which are described in more detail below.\n\n\nFour particularly preferred embodiments of adapter protein capable of forming a disulfide bond with C4 residue in C4-tag are shown in \nFIG. 2\n where Panel A provides a schematic representation of site-specific conjugation between C4-tagged fusion recombinant protein and a complimentary adapter protein. \nFIG. 2\n, Panel B shows a schematic representation of a family of adapter proteins based on T24N, V118C mutant human RNase I. The first embodiment is a fragment of T24N, V118C mutant human RNase I, named HuS(C118) (SEQ ID NOS:15 and 16). Amino groups of HuS(C118) can be used for conjugation to various entities using methods known in art prior to site-specific conjugation of HuS(C118) to C4-tagged proteins. The second embodiment is a fragment of T24N, V118C mutant human RNase I containing the N88C substitution, named HuS(C88,C118) (SEQ ID NOS:17 and 18). C88 thiol group in HuS(C88,C118) can be used for conjugation to various entities using methods known in art after site-specific conjugation of HuS(C88,C118) to C4-tagged proteins. The third and fourth embodiments are based on a chimeric BH-RNase that contains a 1-29-aa fragment of bovine RNase A that differs from a corresponding fragment of human Rnase I in several positions and a 30-127 aa fragment of human RNase I (Gaynutdinov et al., 2003). The third embodiment is the V18C mutant of BH-RNase containing the F8A and Q11P, substitutions, named BHR(A8,P11,C118) (SEQ ID NOS:19 and 20) which does not require removal of 20 N-terminal amino acid residues prior to site-specific conjugation to C4-tagged proteins. Amino groups of BHR(A8,P11,C118) can be derivatized with various entities using methods known in art prior to site-specific conjugation of HuR(A8,P11,C118) to C4-tagged proteins. The fourth embodiment is the V118C mutant BH-RNase containing A8,P11, and C88, named BHR(A8,P11,C88,C118) (SEQ ID NOS:21 and 22) which does not require removal of 20 N-terminal amino acid residues prior to site-specific conjugation to C4-tagged proteins. The C88 thiol group in BHR(A8,P11,C88,C118) can be used for conjugation with various entities using methods known in art after site-specific conjugation of BHR(A8,P11,C88,C118) to C4-tagged proteins. Using methods known in art it will be easy to construct other adapter proteins based on human RNase I capable of site-specific conjugation to C4-tagged proteins and providing convenient platforms for derivatization with various entities. One of skill in the art would appreciate that other adapter proteins based on human RNase I may be used in addition to those explicitly described herein. For example, one of skill in the art would appreciate that adapter proteins based on other ribonucleases, for example bovine RNase A, may be constructed as long as these adapter proteins retain the ability to form conjugates with C4-tag, or similar tags based on N-terminal fragments of other ribonucleases.\n\n\nPanel C in \nFIG. 2\n provides evidence of C4-VEGF and HUS(C118) conjugation via a disulfide bond leading to the appearance of DTT-sensitive new protein bands in samples named HuS-C4-VEGF on the SDS-PAGE gel corresponding to conjugation of one or two adapter HuS(C118) to C4-tags in a dimeric molecule of C4-VEGF. Panel D provides evidence that ribonuclease activity is reconstituted upon chemical conjugate formation, but not upon physical mixing of HuS(C118) adapter protein with C4-tagged recombinant fusion protein (Panel D).\n\n\nThe adapter protein may be derivatized with a host of functional materials to achieve a desired result. For example, in one embodiment, the adapter protein may be derivatized with a dye, such as Cy5.5 dye for optical imaging, or with a lipid for associating the adapter protein with a liposome that acts as a carrier for therapeutic, diagnostic, or research compounds. In one embodiment, the liposomes may carry or be loaded with doxorubicin (“DOXIL”).\n\n\nThe biological conjugates may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to produce pharmaceutical compositions for selectively delivering therapeutic, research, or diagnostic compounds to a target in a patient. Such a pharmaceutical composition may be administered to a patient, and the biological conjugate is permitted to contact the target to deliver the compound to the target in the patient. In these embodiments, useful pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include materials such as water, gelatin, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, plant oils, gums, alcohol, Vaseline, or the like. The pharmaceutical preparation of the invention should include an amount of the biological conjugate effective for the desired activity. The effective dosage will depend on the activity of the particular biological conjugate employed and is thus within the ordinary skill of the art to determine for any particular host mammal or other host organism.\n\n\nIn general, a pharmaceutically effective amount of the biological conjugate is combined in a conventional fashion with the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to produce the pharmaceutical composition. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention is preferably administered internally, e.g., intravenously, in the form of conventional pharmaceutical preparations, for example in conventional enteral or parenteral pharmaceutically acceptable excipients containing organic and/or inorganic inert carriers as described above. The pharmaceutical preparations can be in conventional solid forms, for example, tablets, dragees, suppositories, capsules, or the like, or conventional liquid forms, such as suspensions, emulsions, or the like. If desired, they can be sterilized and/or contain conventional pharmaceutical adjuvants, such as preservatives, stabilizing agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, buffers, or salts used for the adjustment of osmotic pressure. The pharmaceutical preparations may also contain other therapeutically active materials.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe following Examples are intended to illustrate, but in no way limit the scope of the present invention. All parts and percentages are by weight and all temperatures are in degrees Celsius unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nConstruction and Use of Expression Vectors Containing C4- and a Linker Peptide\n\n\n1.

Construction of Vectors for Expression of Proteins Fused to C4-tag.\n\n\nThe pET/Hu(G\n4\nS)\n3 \nvector for expression of recombinant proteins with an N-terminal Hu-tag fused to protein ORF via a (G\n4\nS)\n3 \nlinker was constructed as described (Backer et al., 2004). The R4c amino acid substitution was introduced in Hu-tag of the pET/Hu(G\n4\nS)\n3 \nvector by site-directed mutagenesis using Gene-Tailor Site Directed mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen). Primers (SEQ ID NO:23 and SEQ ID NO:24) were used for introducing the R4c mutation.

The insert was cloned into the pET29a(+) vector cut with XbaI and NcoI. The resulting vector was confirmed by sequencing and designated pET/Hu-C4-G\n4\nS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 25\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-GGATAACAATTCCCCTCTAGAAATAATTTTGTTTAAC\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 26\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-ACTACCCATGGAACCGCCGCCACCAGAGTCCATG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Sub-Cloning of cDNA Fragments Encoding Proteins of Interest into the pET/Hu-C4(G\n4\nS)\n3 \nand pET/Hu-C4-G\n4\nS Vectors.\n\n\nThe pET/Hu-C4(G\n4\nS)\n3 \nand pET/Hu-C4-G\n4\nS vector DNAs were cut separately with NcoI and dephosphorylated. All DNA fragments to be cloned in the above vectors were amplified by PCR using primers introducing NcoI sites to the both ends of the amplified DNA fragments. DNA encoding the 121-aa isoform of human VEGF was amplified from the pLen-121 plasmid DNA using primers (SEQ ID NO:27 and SEQ ID NO:28). DNA encoding a 1-254-aa long N-terminal fragment of anthrax lethal factor (LFn) was amplified from the pGEX-KG LF254 plasmid DNA using primers (SEQ ID NO:29 and SEQ ID NO:30). DNA encoding human annexin V was amplified from the pPAP1-1.6 plasmid using primers (SEQ ID NO:31 and SEQ ID NO:32). Each amplified DNA fragment was cut with NcoI, purified, and cloned into NcoI sites of the vectors pET/Hu-C4(G\n4\nS)\n3 \nand pET/Hu-C4-G\n4\nS. Clones with correct orientations of cloned ORF were selected by PCR using a T7-promoter based sense primer, and confirmed by sequencing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 27\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5′-CACAAGCCATGGCACCCATGGCAGAAGGAGGA\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 28\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5′-ACTACCCATGGTCACCGCCTCGGCTTGTCAC\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 29\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5′-CTGCTCCATGGGAGCGGGCGGTCATGGTGATG\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 30\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5′-ACTACCCATGGCTATAGATTTATTTCTTGTTCGTTAAATTTATC\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 31\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5′-CACAAGCCATGGCACAGGTTCTCAGAG\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 32\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5′-ACTACCCATGGTTAGTCATCTTCTCCACAGAGC\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Fusion Proteins with C4-tag.\n\n\nAll proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) \nE. coli \ngrown in LB medium (Q-Biogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The expression was induced by 1 mM IPTG at the optical density of 0.5-0.7 unit at 600 nm. After induction, cultures were grown for 2.5-3 hrs at 37° C. with shaking at 300 rpm; then harvested by centrifugation and ruptured using EmulsiFlex-C5 (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada).\n\n\nC4-VEGF was expressed in insoluble form and purified as follows: inclusion bodies were solubilized in 8 M urea, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 80 mM Na\n2\nSO\n3\n, 10 mM Na\n2\nS\n4\nO\n6\n, 10 mM DTT, incubated for 6-8 hrs at 4° C. with agitation; then supplemented with 2.5 mM Tris[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine (Pierce), and incubated for 16-18 hrs at 4° C. Solubilized protein was refolded via a tree-step dialysis: first, 10-12 hrs at 4° C. in 10 volumes of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 M urea, 0.5 M arginine, 1 mM reduced glutathione, 0.4 mM oxidized glutathione; second, 24 hrs at 4° C. in 50 volumes of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0; and third, 24 hrs at 4° C. in 50 volumes of 20 mM NaOAc (pH 5.5). After dialysis, solution was clarified by centrifugation (15,000×g for 20 min), and C4-VEGF was purified by chromatography on Heparin HP Sepharose (1-ml pre-packed columns, Amersham). For conjugation, C4 thiol group in C4-VEGF was deprotected by mild DTT treatment using 1.2 molar excess DTT at 34° C. for 45 min.\n\n\nTo minimize potential involvement of cysteine residue present in position 116 in native VEGF121, the inventors prepared a version of C4-VEGF truncated at position 112 using methods known in art. Truncated protein contains 110 amino acids (a 3-112aa fragment of VEGF121), and therefore it was named C4-VEGF\n110\n. The C4-VEGF\n110 \nwas expressed and purified as described above and displayed activities similar to that of C4-VEGF in tissue culture assays.\n\n\nTo further optimize C4-tagged VEGF the inventors constructed a single chain VEGF fused to a single C4 peptide tag via a G\n4\nS linker peptide (C4-scVEGF). In general, engineering, expression, refolding, and purification of monomeric proteins is simplier than oligomeric, or even dimeric, such as native isoforms of VEGF. In addition, scVEGF was designed to avoid formation of inactive monomers of VEGF that are usually present in preparations of dimeric VEGF, to simplify any protein re-engineering of VEGF, to simplify expression, refolding and purification and to simplify conjugation of binding moieties to a single C4-tag. First, the pET/Hu-C4-G\n4\nS vector DNA was cut with BamHI and dephosphorylated. DNA encoding a 3-112-aa long fragment of human VEGF was amplified from the pLen-121 plasmid using a sense primer (SEQ ID NO:33) introducing BamHI site immediately upstream of \nVEGF codon\n 3, and an antisense primer (SEQ ID NO:34) introducing a stop codon immediately downstream of codon 112 of VEGF and BamHI site immediately after the stop codon. The amplified DNA fragment was purified, cut with BamHI, and cloned into BamHI site of the pET/Hu-C4-G4S vector. Correct orientation of cloned ORF was selected by PCR using a T7-promoter based sense primer. Plasmid DNA purified from the selected clones was confirmed by sequencing and designated pET/C4(G4S)VEGF\n110\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 33\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-CACGGATCCGGTGGCGGCGGTAGTGGT\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 34\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-CACGGATCCTCATCTTGCTCTATCTTTCTTTGGTCTGC\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pET/C4(G4S)VEGF\n110 \nvector DNA was cut with NcoI and dephosphorylated.

The amplified DNA fragment was purified, cut with NcoI, and cloned into NcoI site of the pET/C4(G4S)VEGF\n110 \nvector. Clones with two VEGF\n110 \ncopies were selected by PCR using a T7-promoter based sense primer and a T7-terminator based antisense primer. DNA isolated from four random selected clones was sequenced, and a clone containing a VEGF\n110 \ntandem with a head-to-tail VEGF\n110 \norientation was selected for propagation.

For conjugation, C4 thiol group in C4-VEGF was deprotected by mild DTT treatment with 0.5 molar equivalent of DTT.\n\n\nC4-LFn was expressed in a soluble cytoplasmic form and purified as follows: soluble part of bacterial lysate was dialyzed against 200 volumes of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 for 20 hrs at 4° C., clarified by centrifugation (15,000 g for 20 min); and passed through Sepharose Q FF column. C4-LFn containing fractions were pooled together, dialyzed against 100 volumes of 20 mM NaOAc pH 6.5 for 20 hrs at 4° C., and purified on Heparin HP Sepharose followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on Butyl FF Sepharose (1-ml pre-packed columns, Amersham). The yield of C4-LFn was 8-10 mg/L, purity >98% by SDS-PAGE followed by SimplyBlue Safe Stain (Invitrogen).\n\n\nC4-annexin was purified as described for Hu-annexin (Backer et al., 2004). Depending on the nature of a linker, and a protein, a cysteine residue in C4-tag is involved to a various degree in mixed disulfide with red-ox components of the refolding buffer. When necessary, cysteine residues can be deprotected with DTT under conditions that are optimized for every C4-protein.\n\n\n6. Construction and Expression of Adapter Proteins.\n\n\n6.1. Chimeric 1-29B/30-127H-RNase (BH-RNase) comprising of a 1-29 aa fragment of bovine RNase A and a 30-127 aa fragment of human RNase I has been constructed, expressed and purified as described (Gaynutdinov et al., 2003). The V118C mutation was introduced in the pET29/1-29B/30-127H-RNase plasmid DNA by site-directed mutagenesis using Gene-Tailor Site Directed mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen) and primers (SEQ ID NO:37 and SEQ ID NO:38). The VC118 substitution was confirmed by sequencing, the protein was designated BH-RNase(C118). BH-RNase(C118) was expressed and purified as described for wild type BH-RNase (Gaynutdinov et al, 2003). The presence of a reactive thiol group was tested by reaction with a thiol reagent N-(1-pyrene)-maleimide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) followed by RP HPLC analysis as described (Backer et al., 2002). HuS(C118) adapter protein was obtained by limited digestion of BH-RNase(C118) with subtilisin (Sigma) as described for BH-RNase (Gaynutdinov et al., 2003).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 37\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-AAGGCTCTCCGTACGTTCCGTGTCATTTCGACGCG\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 38\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-CGGAACGTACGGAGAGCCTTCGCATGCAAC\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.

The N88C substitution was confirmed by sequencing, and the protein was designated BH-RNase(C88,C118). BH-RNase(C88,C118) was expressed, purified and digested by subtilisin to yield HuS(C88,C118) adapter protein as described above for BH-RNase(C118).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 39\n\n\n5′-TCACTGACTGCCGTCTTACTTGCGGATCCCGTT\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 40\n\n\n8 5′-AGTAAGACGGCAGTCAGTGATATGCATAGAA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 HuR(A8,P11,C118)\n\n\nThe Q11P and F8A mutations were introduced consequently in the pET29/1-29B/30-127H-RNase(V118C) plasmid DNA by site-directed mutagenesis using primers SEQ ID NO:41-44, respectively. Both substitutions were confirmed by sequencing, and the protein was designated BH-RNase(A8,P1,C118).

Construction and Expression of Proteins Used in the Assays.\n\n\n7.1. SLT-VEGF.\n\n\nThe pET/VEGF121-SLT/L plasmid encoding SLT-VEGF fusion protein carrying N-terminal S-tag and His-tag was described previously (Backer & Backer, 2001). The SLT-VEGF DNA coding sequence was amplified by PCR from the pET/VEGF121-SLT/L plasmid DNA using primers (SEQ ID NO:45) introducing NdeI site and (SEQ ID NO:46) introducing Xho I site. Purified PCR product was cut with Nde I and Xho I restrictases, purified, and cloned into Nde I-Xho I sites of the pET29a(+) vector (Novagen). The resulting plasmid was confirmed by sequencing and designated pET29/SLT-VEGF. SLT-VEGF was expressed in BL21(DE3) as described above for C4-carrying proteins, and purified as follows: inclusion bodies were solubilized in 8 M urea, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 80 mM Na\n2\nSO3, 10 mM Na\n2\nS\n4\nO\n6\n, 10 mM DTT and incubated for 6-8 hrs at 4° C. with agitation; then supplemented with 5 mM Tris[2-carboxyethil]phosphine (Pierce) and incubated for 16-18 hrs at 4° C. Solubilized protein was refolded via a tree-step dialysis: first, for 8-10 hrs at 4° C. in 10 volumes of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 M urea, 0.5 M arginine, 1 mM reduced glutathione, 0.4 mM oxidized glutathione; second, 24 hrs at 4° C. in 100 volumes of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% NP-40; and third, 24 hrs at 4° C. in 100 volumes of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 20 mM NaCl. After dialysis, solution was clarified by centrifugation (15,000×g for 20 min), and SLT-VEGF was purified by chromatography on HiTrap Q Sepharose (1-ml pre-packed columns, Amersham).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 45\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-AAAAACATATGAAGGAATTTACCTTAGACTTCTCG\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 46\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-TACTCGAGTCACCGCCTCGGCTTGTCAC\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2. Hu-VEGF.\n\n\nHu-VEGF 121 fusion protein carrying N-terminal wild type Hu-tag was constructed as described in Backer et al., 2003. Hu-VEGF121 was expressed and refolded from inclusion bodies as described above for C4-VEGF with the following modifications: refolding from inclusion bodies was done via a two-step dialysis: first, for 8-10 hrs at 4° C. in 10 volumes of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 M urea, 0.5 M arginine, 1 mM reduced glutathione, 0.4 mM oxidized glutathione; second, 24 hrs at 4° C. in 50 volumes of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. Also, for final Hu-VEGF121 purification, HiTrap SP Sepharose FF followed by Heparin HP Sepharose chromatography (1-ml pre-packed columns, Amersham) was performed.\n\n\n8. Functional Activities of Recombinant Fusion Proteins with C4-tag.\n\n\nA. VEGF activity. Functional activities of VEGF and VEGF-based conjugates were tested in two assays. First assay, stimulation of VEGFR-2 autophosphorylation was performed as follows: near-confluent 293/KDR cells after overnight starvation (DMEM/0.5% FBS) were shifted to serum-free DMEM with 0.5 mM sodium vanadate for 20 min at 37° C., then stimulated with VEGF for 10 min at 37° C., lysed and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine RC20:HRPO conjugate (BD Transduction Labs, USA). Second assay, protection of 293/KDR cells from cytotoxic effect of SLT-VEGF, was performed as follows. 293/KDR cells were plated on 96-\nwell plates\n 20 hrs before the experiment, 1000 cells/well. Varying amounts of VEGF or VEGF-based conjugates were mixed with SLT-VEGF in complete culture medium, and added to cells in triplicate wells to a final SLT-VEGF concentration of 1 nM. Viable cells were quantitated 96 hrs later by CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega, USA).\n\n\nB. Annexin V activity. Functional activities of C4-annexin and HuS-C4-annexin were tested by their ability to compete with FITC-annexin (Sigma) for binding to phosphatidylserine-displaying erythrocytes of stabilized human blood (4C Plus Cell Control, Beckman Coulter, USA) as described (Tait et al., 1995). Briefly, ten million erythrocytes were incubated with varying amounts of annexin in the presence of 5 nM FITC-annexin V (Sigma, St. Louis, Md.) in binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 136 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2) for 15 min at RT. Cells were spun down, resuspended in a binding buffer supplemented with 5 mM EDTA, and spun down again. FITC-annexin fluorescence in the supernatants was measured at \nλ\n \n \n \nex \n485 nm/λ\nem \n520 nm.\n\n\nC. LFn activity. C4-LFn and Hus-C4-LFn were tested for their ability to protect RAW cells from cytotoxic effects of full-length LF in the presence of PA. RAW264.7 cells were plated on 96-\nwell plates\n 15×10\n3 \ncells/well 20 hrs before the experiment. Varying amounts of LFn, C4-LFn, or Hus-C4-LFn were mixed with LF and PA (List Biological, USA) in DMEM complete culture medium, and added to cells in triplicate wells to final concentrations of 2 nM PA and 0.2 nM LF. After 2.5 hrs of incubation at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2\n, viable cell numbers were determined by CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega).\n\n\n9. Cell Lines.\n\n\nHEK293 human transformed embryonic kidney cells (CRL-1573) and RAW 264.7 mouse monocytes (TIB-71) were from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, Md.). 293/KDR cells expressing 2.5×10\n6 \nVEGFR-2/cell have been developed in SibTech, Inc. (Newington, Conn.; Backer and Backer, 2001a). All cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gemini, USA), 2 mM glutamine (Life Technologies, USA), and penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, USA) at 37° C., 5% CO2.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nSite-Specific Conjugation of C4-Tagged Proteins to Adapter Protein HuS(C118)\n\n\nThe protocol included site-specific conjugation of C4-tagged proteins to adapter protein HuS(C118) and testing the functional activities of conjugates in tissue culture.\n\n\nHuS(C118) prepared as described above, and C4-tagged proteins, such as C4-VEGF, or C4-annexin, or C4-LFn, were mixed in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, incubated at 4° C. for 16 hrs, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions. SDS-PAGE analysis under non-reducing conditions revealed new protein products formed in the mixtures during incubation (\nFIG. 2C\n, no DTT lanes). The molecular weights of the proteins in these bands corresponded to the molecular weight of conjugates carrying one or two HuS molecules per parental protein, respectively. Under reducing conditions these bands disappeared, and only bands corresponding to parental proteins and 12-kDa HuS(C118) were detectable (\nFIG. 2C\n, plus DTT lanes). Conjugates were purified first on Hu-peptide column to remove free HuS(C118) and, when necessary, by ion-exchange chromatography to remove free parental proteins.\n\n\nThe functional activities of conjugates were tested in tissue culture assays described above. Activity of HuS-C4-VEGF conjugate was similar to that of C4-VEGF in the induction of VEGFR-2 tyrosine autophosphorylation in 293/KDR cells (\nFIG. 3\n, Panel A) HuS-C4-annexin conjugate was active in competition with FITC-annexin for binding to phosphatidylserine-displaying erythrocytes of stabilized human blood with IC50 of 11+3 nM for conjugate vs. IC50 of 9+4 nM for recombinant annexin V as reported by Tait et al., (1995) (\nFIG. 3\n, Panel B). HuS-C4-LFn was as active as C4-LFn in protection of RAW 264.7 cells from LF in the presence of PA (\nFIG. 3\n, Panel C). Together, these data indicate that conjugation of adapter protein to different C4-tagged protein does not destroy their activity.\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nSite-Specific Conjugation of C4-VEGF and C4-scVEGF to Radionuclide Chelator, 5-Maleimido-2-hydraziniumpyridine Hydrochloride\n\n\nThe protocol included site-specific conjugation of C4-VEGF and C4-scVEGF to chemically active radionuclide chelator 5-maleimido-2-hydraziniumpyridine hydrochloride (Solulink, San Diego, Calif.), and testing the conjugate in tissue culture.\n\n\nC4-VEGF, prepared as described above, was mixed with dimethylformamide dissolved 5-maleimido-2-hydraziniumpyridine hydrochloride hereinafter designated as HYNIC at the molar ratio HYNIC/protein 3:1 in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 and incubated for one hour at room temperature. The product, designated HYNIC-C4-VEGF, was purified on PD-10 column (Amersham, USA) equilibrated with 0.114 M Tricine, pH 6.9. Analytical RP HPLC (\nFIG. 4\n, Panel A) was used to determine the concentration of protein by detection of optical density at 216 nm and the concentration of HYNIC by detection of optical density at 310 nm. Under selected conditions the ratio of HYNIC to C4-VEGF in purified HYNIC-C4-VEGF was ˜1.\n\n\nC4-scVEGF, prepared as described above, was conjugated to HYNIC and purified as described above and the ratio of HYNIC to C4-scVEGF in purified product designated HYNIC-C4-VEGF, was ˜1.\n\n\nThe functional activity of VEGF moiety in HYNIC-C4-VEGF and HYNIC-C4-scVEGF was tested in two tissue culture assays described above, induction of VEGFR-2 tyrosine autophosphorylation in 293/KDR cells (\nFIG. 4\n, Panel B) and protection of 293/KDR cells from cytotoxic activity of SLT-VEGF (\nFIG. 4\n, Panel C). In both assays activities of HYNIC-C4-VEGF and HYNIC-C4-scVEGF were comparable to that of unmodified C4-VEGF, indicating that conjugation of C4-VEGF or C4-scVEGF to HYNIC does not destroy activity of the protein.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nSite-Specific Conjugation of C4-VEGF to Polyethyleneglycol\n\n\nThe protocol included site-specific conjugation of C4-VEGF\n10 \nto polyethyleneglycol functionalized with chemically active maleimide group (Nektar Therapeutics) and testing the conjugate in tissue culture.\n\n\nC4-VEGF\n110\n, prepared as described above, was mixed with either 20 kDa or 40 kDa polyethyleneglycol maleimide (PEG) at PEG to protein ratio of 3:1 and incubated for one hour at room temperature in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0. The products, designated PEG20-C4-VEGF and PEG40-C4-VEGF, were purified from unreacted C4-VEGF and PEG by HPLC gel-filtration on a column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0. Analytical RP HPLC was used to determine the concentration of protein by detection of optical density at 216 nm. Western blot analysis of reduced PEGylated VEGF products with antibody against VEGF revealed a band corresponding to apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa and a band of approximately equal intensity corresponding to unmodified VEGF monomer (\nFIG. 5\n, Panel A), indicating that in the majority of the VEGF dimers only one C4-tag was conjugated to PEG.\n\n\nThe functional activity of PEG-C4-VEGF was tested in tissue culture assay of induction of VEGFR-2 tyrosine autophosphorylation in 293/KDR cells (\nFIG. 5\n, Panel B for PEG40-C4-VEGF) In this assay activities of PEG-C4-VEGF were comparable to that of unmodified C4-VEGF, indicating that site-specific conjugation of C4-VEGF to polyethyleneglycol does not destroy activity of the protein.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nSite-Specific Conjugation of Cyanine Dye Cy5.5 to HuS-C4-VEGF Conjugate\n\n\nThe protocol included preparation of HuS(C88,C118), its conjugation to C4-VEGF, purification of the resulting Hus-C4-VEGF conjugate, and conjugation of said conjugate to a cyanine dye Cy5.5 yielding conjugate named Cy5.5-Hus-C4-VEGF (\nFIG. 6\n, Panel A). For comparative purposes, C4-VEGF was either randomly modified with NHS-Cy5.5 on amino groups to the ratio of 1:1, or modified with maleimide-Cy5.5 on C4 residue in the C4-tag. The functional activities of VEGF moiety in all Cy5.5-containing conjugates were tested in two tissue culture assays described above, induction of VEGFR-2 tyrosine autophosphorylation (\nFIG. 6\n, Panel B) and protection of 293/KDR cells from cytotoxic activity of SLT-VEGF (\nFIG. 6\n, Panel C). In both assays only activities of Cy5.5-Hus-C4-VEGF conjugate were comparable to that of unmodified C4-VEGF, underlying efficacy of using an adapter protein capable of binding to C4-tag for derivatization of proteins.\n\n\nThe utility of Cy5.5-Hus-C4-VEGF for imaging was tested in Balb/c female mice bearing subcutaneous 4T1 mouse mammary adenocarcinoma tumors. Images obtained with KODAK Image Station 2000MM equipped with a band-pass filter at 630 nm and a long-pass filter at 700 nm indicated that Cy5.5-HuS-C4-VEGF conjugate preferentially localized to the periphery of primary tumor (\nFIG. 6\n, Panel D). This preferential localization was inhibited in mice pretreated with SLT-VEGF protein that destroys VEGFR-2 positive cells in tumors (Backer et al., submitted), indicating that accumulation of Cy5.5-HuS-C4-VEGF conjugate in tumor is VEGF-receptor mediated and can be used for specific imaging of tumor vasculature.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nThe Use of C4-Tag and an Adapter Protein Covalently Bound to this Tag for Construction of VEGF-Driven Conjugates Containing Drug-Loaded Liposomes for Targeted Drug Delivery\n\n\nThe protocol included preparation of HuS(C118), its conjugation to PEG-lipid-maleimide, insertion of lipidated HuS(C118) into doxorubicin-loaded liposomes, that leads to a standardized construct named Lip/HuS(C118), and conjugation of this construct to C4-VEGF, that yielded Lip/Hus-C4-VEGF (\nFIG. 7\n, Panel A). The functional activity of VEGF moiety in Lip/Hus-C4-VEGF conjugate were tested in a tissue culture assay described above, induction of VEGFR-2 tyrosine phosphorylation in 293/KDR cells (\nFIG. 7\n, Panel B). In this assay VEGF activity of Lip/Hus-C4-VEGF liposomes was comparable to that of unmodified C4-VEGF, underlying efficacy of using an adapter protein capable of binding to C4-tag for derivatization of proteins.\n\n\nA 15-min exposure of 293/KDR cells to Lip/HuS-C4-VEGF resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth (\nFIG. 7\n, Panel C), while equivalent amounts of untargeted doxorubicin-loaded liposomes (commercially available under the trade name “DOXIL”) derivatized with HuS(C118) alone were not toxic for these cells indicating a VEGF receptor-mediated mechanism of cytotoxicity of Lip/Hus-C4-VEGF targeted liposomes. This mechanism was further confirmed by ability of VEGF to inhibit of cytotoxicity of Lip/Hus-C4-VEGF in a dose-dependent manner (\nFIG. 7D\n).\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nThe Use of C4-Tag for Construction of Scvegf-Driven Conjugates Containing Drug-Loaded Liposomes for Targeted Drug Delivery\n\n\nThe protocol included preparation of C4-scVEGF its conjugation to PEG-lipid-maleimide, and insertion of lipidated C4-scVEGF into doxorubicin-loaded liposomes (“DOXIL”) (\nFIG. 8\n, Panel A). The functional activity of VEGF moiety in Lip/C4-scVEGF conjugate were tested in a tissue culture assay described above, induction of VEGFR-2 tyrosine phosphorylation in 293/KDR cells (\nFIG. 8\n, Panel B). In this assay VEGF activity of Lip/C4-scVEGF liposomes was comparable to that of unmodified C4-VEGF, underlying efficacy of using C4-scVEGF.\n\n\nA 15-min exposure of 293/KDR cells to Lip/C4-scVEGF resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth (\nFIG. 8\n, Panel C), while equivalent amounts of untargeted doxorubicin-loaded liposomes (“DOXIL”) were not toxic for these cells indicating a VEGF receptor-mediated mechanism of cytotoxicity of Lip/C4-scVEGF targeted liposomes. This mechanism was further confirmed by ability of VEGF to inhibit of cytotoxicity of Lip/Hus-C4-VEGF in a dose-dependent manner (\nFIG. 8D\n).\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAdams, G.

Description\n\n\n\n\n METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER, TUMORS, AND\n\n\nTUMOR-RELATED DISORDERS\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE\n\n\n[0001] This application claims the benefit of U. S. Provisional Application No. 60/949,483, filed July 12, 2007; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/990,900, filed November 28, 2007; and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/044,425, filed April 11, 2008, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. FIELD\n\n\n[0002] The present invention relates to combination compositions and the use of such combinations for the treatment of cancer, tumors, and tumor-related disorders.\n\n\nBACKGROUND [0003] Cancer, tumors, tumor-related disorders, and neoplastic disease states are serious and often times life-threatening conditions. These diseases and disorders, which are characterized by rapidly- proliferating cell growth, continue to be the subject of research efforts directed toward the identification of therapeutic agents which are effective in the treatment thereof. Such agents prolong the survival of the patient, inhibit the rapidly-proliferating cell growth associated with the neoplasm, or effect a regression of the neoplasm. [0004] Generally, surgery and radiation therapy are the first modalities considered for the treatment of cancer that is considered locally confined, and offer the best prognosis. Chemotherapy treatment of certain cancers typically results in disappointing survival rates but still offer a survival benefit. For example, in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, such as the use of either cisplatin or carbop latin plus one of either paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, irinotecan, etoposide, vinblastine, or bevacizumab is employed. If patients cannot tolerate this therapy, a single agent, such as N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4- amine, commonly known as erlotinib (Tarceva®), can be used. Erlotinib targets the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase which is highly expressed and occasionally mutated in various forms of cancer. If patients fail to respond to an erlotinib treatment, additional conventional treatment offers limited benefit.\n\n\n[0005] Despite erlotinib' s approval for the treatment of stage IIIB and IV non-small cell lung cancer, as with most therapeutic agents, side-effects result from its use. For example, common side effects, occurring in greater than 30% of patients taking erlotinib, include, rash, diarrhea, poor appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, nausea and vomiting. Additionally, less common side effects include infection, mouth sores, itching, dry skin, eye irritation, pulmonary fibrosis, and abdominal pain. Of greater concern, is the growing view that, while utilization of erlotinib for the treatment of tumors may initially shrink the size of the tumor, the tumor may eventually enlarge in size, indicating, among other things, the development of resistance. Erlotinib may be representative of the types of \n\n therapeutic agents being used for cancer treatment; in that its use has an effect on cancer, but because of other factors, which are not entirely known, the tumor develops resistance and progresses. [0006] What is needed, therefore, are compositions and/or methods of treatment for cancer which take advantage of the synergy found in a therapeutic combination that could increase the effectiveness of the agents and reduce and/or eliminate the side effects typically associated with conventional treatments.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0007] The present invention is based at least in part on a synergistic effect obtained in treating conditions such as cancer by a combination comprising a COX-2 selective inhibitor and an EGFR inhibitor. Some of the possible favorable outcomes for synergism include 1) increasing the efficacy of the therapeutic effect, 2) decreasing the dosage but increasing or maintaining the same efficacy to avoid toxicity, 3) minimizing or slowing down the development of drug resistance, and 4) providing selective synergism against target (or efficacy synergism) versus host (or toxicity antagonism). [0008] While some embodiments of the invention are illustrated through a fixed dose combination comprising a COX-2 inhibitor and an EGFR inhibitor, the embodiments of the invention cover compositions and methods wherein the COX-2 inhibitor and the EGFR inhibitor are provided in separate dosage forms.\n\n\n[0009] The present invention is based, at least in part on the discovery that combinations of a 1,2- diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor provide numerous advantages in the treatment of cancer, tumors, and tumor-related disorders. These combinations may allow for lesser amounts of each particular agent to be delivered and may produce the same or better effect as a greater amount of each particular agent. For example, a combination of a 1 ,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor (provided in one fixed dose or in two separate dosage forms) will increase therapeutic efficacy, reduce side effects, reduce resistance, and when a fixed dose is used reduce the pill burden, enhance patient compliance, and thus, support a more favorable treatment setting and outcome. Such combinations can further increase the benefit of each particular agent which otherwise would be only marginally effective. As such, this synergistic or enhancement effect can be employed in the treatment of cancer, tumors, and tumor-related disorders, and may overcome resistance of tumors to drugs at conventional doses. Methods of Use\n\n\n[0010] The present invention provides a method for treating cancer, tumors, and tumor-related disorders. For example, the method comprises administering to a subject in a combination therapy an amount of a COX-2 selective inhibitor and an EGFR inhibitor, wherein the COX-2 selective inhibitor and the EGFR inhibitor combine to give a therapy suitable for treating a cancer, tumor, and tumor- related disorders.\n\n\n[0011] The invention further provides combinations of COX-2 selective inhibitors and EGFR inhibitors for antineoplastic, anti-tumor, anti-cancer combination therapy.

[00112] Figure 2 provides an illustration of the interactions between the EGFR and COX pathways.\n\n\n[00113] Figure 3 provides a graph illustrating the results of a A431 squamous vulvar carcinoma xenograft study.\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\n[00114] To facilitate understanding of the disclosure set forth herein, a number of terms are defined below. \n\n Definitions\n\n\n[00115] As used herein, \"abnormal cell growth,\" refers to cell growth that is independent of normal regulatory mechanisms (e.g., loss of contact inhibition), including the abnormal growth of normal cells and the growth of abnormal cells. This includes, but is not limited to, the abnormal growth of: (1) tumor cells (tumors), both benign and malignant, expressing an activated Ras oncogene; (2) tumor cells, both benign and malignant, in which the Ras protein is activated as a result of oncogenic mutation in another gene; (3) benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant Ras activation occurs. Examples of such benign proliferative diseases are psoriasis, benign prostatic hypertrophy, human papilloma virus (HPV), and restenosis. Abnormal cell growth, also refers to and includes the abnormal growth of cells, both benign and malignant, resulting from activity of the enzymes farnesyl protein transferase, protein kinases, protein phosphatases, lipid kinases, lipid phosphatases, or activity of transcription factors, or intracellular or cell surface receptor proteins. [00116] \"Neoplasia\" as described herein, is an abnormal, unregulated and disorganized proliferation of cells that is distinguished from normal cells by autonomous growth and somatic mutations. An accumulation of neoplastic cells is also known as a neoplasm, or tumor. As neoplastic cells grow and divide they pass on their genetic mutations and proliferative characteristics to progeny cells, hi some embodiments, the neoplasm can be benign or malignant.\n\n\n[00117] \"Metastasis,\" as used herein, refers to the dissemination of tumor cells via lymphatics or blood vessels. Metastasis also refers to the migration of tumor cells by direct extension through serous cavities, or subarachnoid or other spaces. Through the process of metastasis, tumor cell migration to other areas of the body establishes neoplasms in areas away from the site of initial appearance. [00118] As discussed herein, \"angiogenesis\" is prominent in tumor formation and metastasis. Angiogenic factors have been found associated with several solid tumors such as rhabdomyosarcomas, retinoblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma, and osteosarcoma. A tumor cannot expand without a blood supply to provide nutrients and remove cellular wastes. Tumors in which angiogenesis is important include solid tumors such as renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and benign tumors such as acoustic neuroma, and neurofibroma, trachoma and pyogenic granulomas. Angiogenesis has been associated with blood-born tumors such as leukemias. It is believed that angiogenesis plays a role in the abnormalities in the bone marrow that give rise to leukemia. Prevention of angiogenesis could halt the growth of cancerous tumors and the resultant damage to the subject due to the presence of the tumor.\n\n\n[00119] The term \"subject\" refers to an animal, including, but not limited to, a primate (e.g., human), cow, sheep, goat, horse, dog, cat, rabbit, rat, or mouse. The terms \"subject\" and \"patient\" are used interchangeably herein in reference, for example, to a mammalian subject, such as a human subject. [00120] The terms \"treat,\" \"treating,\" and \"treatment\" are meant to include alleviating or abrogating a disorder, disease, or condition; or one or more of the symptoms associated with the disorder, disease, or condition; or alleviating or eradicating the cause(s) of the disorder, disease, or condition itself. \n\n [00121] The term \"therapeutically effective amount\" refers to the amount of a compound that, when administered, is sufficient to prevent development of, or alleviate to some extent, one or more of the symptoms of the disorder, disease, or condition being treated. The term \"therapeutically effective amount\" also refers to the amount of a compound that is sufficient to elicit the biological or medical response of a cell, tissue, system, animal, or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor, or clinician.\n\n\n[00122] The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,\" \"pharmaceutically acceptable excipient,\" \"physiologically acceptable carrier,\" or \"physiologically acceptable excipient\" refers to a pharmaceutically-acceptable material, composition, or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent, or encapsulating material. Each component must be \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of a pharmaceutical formulation. It must also be suitable for use in contact with the tissue or organ of humans and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, immunogenicity, or other problems or complications, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. See, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Edition; Lippincott Williams & Wilkins: Philadelphia, PA, 2005; Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 5th Edition; Rowe et al., Eds., The Pharmaceutical Press and the American Pharmaceutical Association: 2005; and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives, 3rd Edition; Ash and Ash Eds., Gower Publishing Company: 2007; Pharmaceutical Preformulation and Formulation, Gibson Ed., CRC Press LLC: Boca Raton, FL, 2004). [00123] The term \"pharmaceutical composition\" refers to a mixture of a compound disclosed herein with other chemical components, such as diluents or carriers. The pharmaceutical composition facilitates administration of the compound to an organism. Multiple techniques of administering a compound exist in the art including, but not limited to, oral, injection, aerosol, parenteral, and topical administration. Pharmaceutical compositions can also be obtained by reacting compounds with inorganic or organic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like.\n\n\nCyclooxygenase [00124] Cyclooxygenase (COX) is an enzyme that is responsible for the formation of important biological mediators called prostanoids, including prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxane.\n\n\nCOX converts arachidonic acid, an ω-6 essential fatty acid, to prostaglandin H\n2\n (PGH\n2\n), the precursor of the series-2 prostanoids. The enzyme contains two active sites: a heme with peroxidase activity, responsible for the reduction of PGG\n2\n to PGH\n2\n, and a cyclooxygenase site, where arachidonic acid is converted into the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G\n2\n (PGG\n2\n). The reaction proceeds through a hydrogen atom abstraction from arachidonic acid by a tyrosine radical generated by the peroxidase active site, then two oxygen molecules react with the arachidonic acid radical, giving PGG\n2\n. \n\n [00125] COX-I is a constitutive enzyme responsible for biosynthesis of prostaglandins in the gastric mucosa and in the kidney among other sites. COX-2 is an enzyme that is produced by an inducible gene that is responsible for biosynthesis of prostaglandins in inflammatory cells. Inflammation causes induction of COX-2, leading to release of prostanoids (prostaglandin E2), which sensitize peripheral nociceptor terminals and produce localized pain hypersensitivity, inflammation and edema. [00126] Historically, physicians have treated inflammation-related disorders with a regimen of NSAIDs such as, for example, aspirin and ibuprofen. Undesirably, however, some NSAIDs are known to cause gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or ulcers in patients undergoing consistent long term regimens of NSAID therapy. Henry et al., Lancet, 1991, 337, 730. A reduction of unwanted side effects of common NSAIDs was made possible by the discovery that the two cyclooxygenases involved in the transformation of arachidonic acid as the first step in the prostaglandin synthesis pathway were cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-I) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).\n\n\n[00127] Many common NSAIDs are now known to be inhibitors of both COX-I and COX-2. Accordingly, when administered in sufficiently high levels, these NSAIDs not only alleviate the inflammatory consequences of COX-2 activity, but also inhibit the beneficial gastric maintenance activities of COX-I. Research into the area of arachidonic acid metabolism has resulted in the discovery of compounds that selectively inhibit the COX-2 enzyme to a greater extent than they inhibit COX-I. These COX-2 selective inhibitors are believed to offer advantages that include the capacity to prevent or reduce inflammation while avoiding harmful side effects associated with the inhibition of COX-I . Thus, COX-2 selective inhibitors have shown great promise for use in therapies, especially in therapies that require maintenance administration, such as for pain and inflammation control.\n\n\n[00128] As described herein, the terms \"cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor\" and \"Cox-2 inhibitor\", which can be used interchangeably herein, denote compounds which inhibit the cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme (COX-2) regardless of the degree of inhibition of the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme (COX-I), and include pharmaceutically acceptable racemates, enantiomers, tautomers, salts, esters and prodrugs of those compounds. Thus, for purposes of the present disclosure, a compound is considered a COX-2 inhibitor although the compound inhibits COX-2 to an equal, greater, or lesser degree than it inhibits COX-I . COX-2 inhibitors herein therefore encompass many traditional non-selective NSAIDs. COX-2 Selective Inhibitors\n\n\n[00129] COX-2 inhibitors useful according to embodiments of the present disclosure are agents and compounds that selectively or preferentially inhibit COX-2 to a greater degree than they inhibit COX- 1. Such agents and compounds are termed \"COX-2 selective inhibitors\" herein. [00130] hi practice, in a test for selectivity of a COX-2 selective inhibitor, the observed selectivity varies depending upon the conditions under which the test is performed and on the compound being tested. For example, selectivity of a COX-2 inhibitor can be measured as a ratio of the in vitro or in vivo IC\n50\n value for inhibition of COX-I, divided by the corresponding IC50 value for inhibition of \n\n COX-2 (COX-I IC\n50\n/COX-2 IC\n50\n). A COX-2 selective inhibitor herein is thus any inhibitor for which COX-I IC\n50\n/COX-2 IC\n50\n is greater than 1. In various embodiments, this ratio is greater than about 2, greater than about 5, greater than about 10, greater than about 50, or greater than about 100. [0013I]In one embodiment, the invention provides a composition, comprising a combination of a 1,2- diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor wherein the ratio of selectivity of COX-2 over COX-I inhibition is greater than about 1.

In some embodiments, the invention provides methods for treating a tumor and/or tumor related disease comprising administering a combination of a 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor wherein the ratio of selectivity of COX-2 over COX-I inhibition is greater than about 20, than about 50, and about 100. In other embodiments, the invention provides methods for treating a tumor and/or tumor related disease comprising administering a combination of a 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor wherein the 1-2-diphenylpyrrole derivative is 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4- sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and the EGFR inhibitor is erlotinib wherein the ratio of selectivity of COX- 2 over COX-I inhibition is greater than about 1, about 2, about 5, about 7.8, about 10, about 20, about 50, and about 100.\n\n\n[00133] As used herein, the term \"IC\n50\n\" with respect to a COX-I or COX-2 inhibitor refers to the concentration of a compound that is required to produce 50% inhibition of activity of COX-I or COX- 2. In one embodiment, 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivatives useful in the present disclosure can have a COX-2 ICso of less than about 3 μM. In another embodiment, the 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative has a COX-2 IC\n50\n of less than about 2.8 μM. In yet another embodiment, the 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative has a COX-2 IC\n50\n of less than about 2 μM. In some embodiments, 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative useful in the present disclosure can have a COX-2 IC\n50\n of less than about 1 μM, less than about 0.5 μM, or less than about 0.2 μM. 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivatives useful in the present disclosure can have a COX-I IC\n50\n of greater than about 1 μM, for example greater than about 20 μM. In one embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising a combination of a 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor wherein the IC\n50\n is less than about 1 μM. In another embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising a combination of a 1 ,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor wherein the IC\n50\n is less than about 0.5 μM. hi a further embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising a combination of a 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor wherein the IC\n50\n is less than about 0.2 μM.

In one embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising a combination of a 1 ,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor wherein the NSAID-induced side effects are substantially diminished. For example, NSAID-induced side effects include, but are not limited to, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, decreased appetite, rash, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, fluid retention, edema, kidney failure, liver failure, ulcers and prolonged bleeding after surgery. In another embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising a combination of a 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor wherein the 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative is 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4- sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and the EGFR inhibitor is erlotinib and wherein the NSAID-induced side effects are substantially diminished.\n\n\n[00135] A COX-2 selective inhibitor can be used in a form of a prodrug thereof. As described herein, a \"COX-2 prodrug\" is a compound that can be converted into an active COX-2 selective inhibitor by metabolic or simple chemical processes within the body of the subject. One example of a prodrug for a COX-2 selective inhibitor is parecoxib, for example in a form of a salt such as parecoxib sodium, which is a therapeutically effective prodrug of the tricyclic COX-2 selective inhibitor valdecoxib. Overexpression of COX-2 and Cancer\n\n\n[00136] The overexpression of COX-2 and also the upstream and downstream enzymes of the prostaglandin synthesis pathway has been demonstrated in multiple cancer types and some pre- neoplastic lesions. Direct interactions of prostaglandins with their receptors through autocrine or paracrine pathways to enhance cellular survival or stimulate angiogenesis have been proposed as molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-carcinogenic functions of COX enzymes. In this respect, preclinical studies suggest that COX-2 may be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of some types of lung cancer. Most of the studies point to its involvement in non-small cell lung cancer. Survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer expressing high levels of COX-2 is markedly reduced.\n\n\nTreatment of humans with the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib augments the antitumor effects of chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n\nStudies indicate that prostaglandins synthesized by cyclooxygenase play a critical role in the initiation and promotion of cancer. Aberrant COX-2 expression was reported in colorectal carcinomas and adenomas, and has been detected in various human cancers, including those of the breast. Moreover, COX-2 is overexpressed in neoplastic lesions of the colon, breast, lung, prostate, esophagus, pancreas, intestine, cervix, ovaries, urinary bladder and head and neck (see Table 1 below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. COX-2 Expression in Tumors\n\n\n[00137] COX-2 overexpression in murine mammary glands is sufficient to cause tumor formation. In several in vitro and animal models, COX-2 inhibitors have inhibited tumor growth and metastasis. [00138] In addition to cancers per se, COX-2 is also expressed in the angiogenic vasculature within and adjacent to hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions indicating that COX-2 plays a role in angiogenesis. hi both the mouse and rat, COX-2 inhibitors markedly inhibited bFGF-induces neovascularization. The utility of COX-2 inhibitors as chemopreventive, antiangiogenic and chemotherapeutic agents is described in the literature. Koki et al., Exp. Opin., Invest. Drugs, 1999, 8(10) 1623-38. [00139] COX-2 has been shown to regulate some embodiments of tumor-associated angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is an attractive therapeutic target because it is a multi-step process that occurs in a specific sequence, thus providing several possible targets for drug action. Angiogenesis is important in two stages of tumor metastasis. The first stage where angiogenesis stimulation is important is in the vascularization of the tumor which allows the tumor cells to enter the blood stream and to circulate throughout the body. After the tumor cells have left the primary site and have settled into the secondary, metastasis site, angiogenesis must occur before the new tumor can grow and expand. Therefore, prevention of angiogenesis could lead to the prevention of metastasis of tumors and possibly contain the neoplastic growth at the primary site. Examples of agents that interfere with several of these steps include, angiostatin, endostatin, interferon alpha and COX-2 selective inhibitors that prevent the growth of cells that form new blood vessels; and protein-based compounds that simultaneously interfere with several of these targets.\n\n\n[00140] Additionally, several studies have suggested that COX-2 expression is associated with parameters of aggressive breast cancer, including large tumor size, positive axillary lymph node metastases, and HER2-positive tumor status. Studies of mammary tumors in mice and rats have indicated that moderate to high COX-2 expression is related to the genesis of mammary tumors that are sensitive to treatment with nonspecific and specific COX-2 inhibitors. Further studies have shown that increased amounts of prostaglandins and COX-2 are commonly found in a wide range of premalignant tissues and malignant tumors including cervical dysplasia and cancer. Elevated prostaglandin and COX-2 levels substantially contribute to carcinogenesis by inhibiting apoptosis and stimulating angiogenesis. Tsujii and DuBois, Cell, 1995, 83, 493-501. [00141] Further, COX-2 is also highly expressed in prostate cancer, particularly in the epithelial cell of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer. It was shown that treatment of human \n\n prostate cancer cell lines with a selective COX-2 inhibitor induces apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. The in vivo results also indicate that the COX-2 inhibitor decreases tumor microvessel density and angiogenesis. COX-2 inhibitors can prevent the hypnoxic upregulation of a potent angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor. [00142] Overexpression of COX-2 has been documented in several premalignant and malignant tissues. Subbaramaiah et al., Trends Pharmacol. ScL, 2003, 24, 96-102. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, this increase in expression is thought to be a product of stimulation of PKC signaling, which stimulates activity of MAPK, enhancing transcription of COX-2 by nuclear factors. Additionally, enhanced stability of COX-2 niRNA transcripts in cancer cells due to augmented binding of the RNA-binding protein HuR, as well as activation of extracellular signal related kinase 1 and 2 (ERK 1 and 2) and p38, is thought to contribute to increased expression of COX-2. [00143] These results indicate that COX-2 inhibitors may serve as effective chemopreventive and therapeutic agents in cancer of the prostate. COX-2 Selective Inhibitors [00144] It has recently been found that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been associated with the prevention and treatment of several types of cancer. Thun et al., J. National Cancer Inst, 2002, 94(4), 252-66. COX-2 inhibitors have been utilized for the treatment of cancer and for the treatment of tumors. For example, celecoxib, a COX-2 selective inhibitor, exerted a potent inhibition of fibroblast growth factor-induced corneal angiogenesis in rats. Masferrer et al., Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Research, 1999, 40, 396. Other COX-2 inhibitors have been described for the treatment of cancer, tumors and neoplasia. FR 27 71 005 describes compositions containing a COX-2 inhibitor and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist used to treat cancer and other diseases. Further, WO 99/18960 describes a combination comprising a COX-2 inhibitor that can be used to treat colorectal and breast cancer. Additionally, WO 97/36497 describes a combination comprising a COX- 2 inhibitor and a 5 -lipoxygenase inhibitor useful in treating cancer. 1,2-Diphenylpyrrole Derivatives\n\n\n[00145] 1,2-Diphenylpyrrole derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs are known to have analgesic and antiphlogistic properties. Further, they have been shown to act as COX-2 selective inhibitors and are thus effective for the prophylaxis and therapy of diseases mediated by COX-2 and/or inflammatory cytokines. In addition, 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivatives have been shown to treat diseases involving or resulting from the resorption of bone, such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.\n\n\n[00146] These types of analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents and/or antipyretics exhibit effects not only on inflammatory diseases, such as pain, pyrexia, and edema, but also on chronic inflammatory diseases, such as chronic rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, allergic inflammatory diseases, asthma, sepsis, psoriasis, various autoimmune diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile onset \n\n diabetes, autoimmune intestinal diseases (such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), viral infection, and glomerulonephritis.\n\n\n[00147] 1,2-Diphenylpyrrole derivatives described herein have the general formula:\n\n\n \n\n wherein:\n\n\nR is a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms;

It has a molecular formula OfC^H\n2O\nN\n2\nOaS, a molecular weight of 356.4 and the CAS registry number is 197904-84-0. Receptor Tyrosine Kinases\n\n\n[00161] Protein tyrosine kinases are a class of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP or GTP to the tyrosine residue located on protein substrates. Protein tyrosine kinases clearly play a role in normal cell growth. Many of the growth factor receptor proteins function as tyrosine kinases and it is by this process that they effect signaling. The interaction of growth factors with these receptors is a necessary event in normal regulation of cell growth. Under certain conditions, however, as a result of either mutation or overexpression, these receptors can become deregulated; the result of which is uncontrolled cell proliferation which can lead to tumor growth and \n\n ultimately to the disease known as cancer. Wilks, Adv. Cancer Res., 1993, 60, 43. Among the growth factor receptor kinases and their proto-oncogenes that have been identified and which are targets of the combinations presented herein are the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase (EGFR kinase, the protein product of the erbB oncogene), and the product produced by the erbB-2 (also referred to as the neu or HER2) oncogene. Since the phosphorylation event is a necessary signal for cell division to occur and since overexpressed or mutated kinases have been associated with cancer, an inhibitor of this event, a protein tyrosine inhibitor, will have therapeutic value for the treatment of cancer and other diseases characterized by uncontrolled or abnormal cell growth. For example, overexpression of the receptor kinase product of the erbB-2 oncogene has been associated with human breast and ovarian cancers. Slamon et. al., Science, 1989, 244, 707. Deregulation of EGFR kinase has been associated with epidermoid tumors and tumors involving other major organs. Because of the importance of the role played by deregulated receptor kinases in the pathogenesis of cancer, many recent studies have dealt with the development of specific PTK inhibitors as potential anti-cancer therapeutic agents. [00162] Receptor tyrosine kinases span the cell membrane and possess an extracellular binding domain for growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular portion which functions as a kinase to phosphorylate specific tyrosine kinase residues in proteins and hence to influence cell proliferation. The EGF receptor tyrosine kinase family has four members: EGFR (HERl, erbBl); HER2 (c-erbB2, erbB2, neu); HER3 (erbB3); and HER4 (erbB4). The ErbB receptors generally transduce signals through two pathways. It is known that such kinases are frequently and aberrantly expressed in common human cancers such as breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer of colon, rectum or stomach, leukemia, and ovarian, bronchial or pancreatic cancer. As discussed previously, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is mutated and/or overexpressed in many human cancers such as brain, lung, squamous cell, bladder, gastric, breast, head and neck, oesophageal, gynecological and thyroid tumors. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors\n\n\n[00163] Control of cell growth is regulated by the interaction of soluble growth factors and cell membrane receptors. The first step in the mitogenic stimulation of epidermal cells is the specific binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to a membrane glycoprotein known as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The EGFR is composed of 1,186 amino acids which are divided into an extracellular portion of 621 residues and a cytoplasmic portion of 542 residues connected by a single hydrophobic transmembrane segment of 23 residues. Ullrich et al., Nature, 1986, vol. 309, 418-25. The external portion of the EGFR can be subdivided into four domains. Recently, it has been demonstrated that domain III, residues 333 to 460 which is flanked by two cysteine domains is likely to contain the EGFR binding site of the receptor. Lax et al., MoI. And Cell Biol. , 1988, vol. 8, 1831- 34. The binding of EGF to domain III leads to the initiation of pleiotropic responses leading to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. \n\n [00164] EGFR has also been found in various types of human tumor cells and that those cells overexpress EGFR. For example, the cancerous cells of bladder tumors have been shown to have a relatively large population of EGF receptors. Neal et al., Lancet, 1985, vol. 1, 366-67. Breast cancer cells exhibit a positive correlation between EGFR density and tumor size and a negative correlation with the extent of differentiation. Sainsbury et al., Lancet, 1985, vol. 1, 364-66. The tumorigenicity of a series of human vulval epidermoid carcinoma (A431) clonal variants implanted into athymic mice having different levels of EGFR was found to correlate directly with the level of expression of the EGF receptor. Santon et al., Cancer Res., 1986, vol. 46, 4700-01. Thus, it has been proposed that overexpression of EGFRs play a role in the origin or tumorigenesis of cancer cells. EGFR and COX Pathways\n\n\n[00165] The relationship between the EGFR and COX pathways, to date, has not yet been fully elucidated. It has been submitted, however, that induction of COX-2 results in the production of increased levels of prostaglandins which then stimulate angiogenesis, cell proliferation and cell differentiation in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. As described above, NSAIDs inhibit this process. Prostaglandins promote angiogenesis, along with cellular differention and proliferation.\n\n\nThey also activate signaling through the EGFR. EGFR activation leads to phosphorylation on tyrosine residues by the receptor's tyrosine kinase domain, initiating a signaling pathway that includes the molecules Grb-2, SOS, the small G protein Raf. Raf activates Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase (MAPKK) and group of nuclear transcription factors (c-myc, c-fos, c-jun); (see Figure 2). These factors initiate transcription of genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, these factors induce transcription of the COX-2. These effects may significantly amplify the original EGFR mediated signal and lead to pro-neoplastic effects. Inhibiting both signaling pathways could lead to a significant anti-neoplastic effect. [00166] Studies have provided support that EGFR induces COX-2 in intestinal epithelial cells and anti-HER2 antibodies can inhibit COX-2 expression in colorectal cancer cells. In addition, overexpression of COX-I or COX-2 in colon carcinoma cells has been shown to increase EGFR expression. Thus, COX and EGFR levels appear to be linked in a positive feedback cycle during colon cancer development. While the exact mechanism by which dysregulated EGF signaling promotes colon carcinogenesis is not clearly understood, it has been submitted that EGFR activation in a variety of cell types results in stimulation of cell proliferation and alterations in cell motility and/or adhesion to extra-cellular matrix. Studies have suggested that COX can positively influence tumor growth by promoting tumor associated angiogenesis.\n\n\n[00167] It has also recently been proposed that the activation and overexpression of COX-2 in adenomatous polyps is due to activation of the EGFR. EGFR stimulation by one of its ligands, amphiregulin (AR), induces the nuclear targeting of COX-2, release of prostaglandins and subsequent mitogenesis, in polarized colonic epithelial cells. COX-2 inhibitors have been shown to prevent this series of events. \n\n EGFR Inhibitors\n\n\n[00168] Accordingly, it has been recognized that inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases are useful as selective inhibitors of the growth of mammalian cancer cells. For example, erbstatin, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, selectively attenuates the growth in athymic nude mice of a transplanted human mammary carcinoma which expresses EGFR but is without effect on the growth of another carcinoma which does not express the EGFR.\n\n\n[00169] Various other compounds, such as styrene derivatives, have also been shown to possess tyrosine kinase inhibitory properties. Others have disclosed that certain quinazoline derivatives possess anti-cancer properties which result from their tyrosine inhibitory properties. [00170] As described herein, an \"EGFR inhibitor\" is a molecule which inhibits the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Compounds which are EGFR inhibitors can readily be identified by one skilled in the art using methods such as, for example, standard pharmacological test procedures which measure the inhibition of the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue of a peptide substrate catalyzed by EGFR. Briefly, the peptide substrate (RR-SRC) has the sequence arg-arg-leu- ile-glu-asp-ala-glu-tyr-ala-ala-arg-gly. The enzyme is obtained as a membrane extract of A431 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md.). A431 cells are grown in T 175 flasks to 80% confluency. The cells are washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) without Ca\n2+\n. Flasks are rotated for 1.5 hours in 20 ml PBS with 1.0 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at room temperature and centrifuged at 600 g for 10 minutes. The cells are solubilized in 1 ml per 5xlO\n6\n cells of cold lysis buffer {10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.6, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl-fluoride (PMSF), 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate} in a Dounce homogenizer with 10 strokes on ice. The lysate is centrifuged at 600 g for 10 minutes first to clear cell debris and the supernatant further centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min at 4.degree. C. The membrane pellet is suspended in 1.5 ml HNG buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 125 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol). The membrane extract is divided into aliquots, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 \n0\nC. [00171] Compositions to be evaluated are made into 10 mg/ml stock solutions in 100% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Stock solutions are diluted to 500 mM with buffer (30 mM Hepes pH 7.4) and then serially diluted to the desired concentration. An aliquot of the A431 membrane extract (10 mg/ml) is diluted in 30 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) to give a protein concentration of 50 μg/ml. To 4 μl of enzyme preparation, EGF (1 μl at 12 μg/ml ) is added and incubated for 10 min on ice followed by 4 μl of the test compound or buffer; this mix is incubated on ice for 30 min. To this is added the P- ATP (10 mCi/ml) diluted 1 : 10 in assay buffer along with the substrate peptide at a concentration of 0.5 mM (control reactions get no test compound) and the reaction is allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30\n0\nC. The reaction is stopped with 10% TCA and left on ice for at least 10 min after which tubes are microcentrifuged at full speed for 15 min. A portion of the supernatants are then spotted on P81 phosphocellulose discs and washed twice in 1% acetic acid then water for 5 min each followed by \n\n scintillation counting. The results obtained can be expressed as an IC\n50\n. The IC\n50\n is the concentration of test compound needed to reduce the total amount of phosphorylated substrate by 50%. The % inhibition of the test compound is determined for at least three different concentrations and the IC\n50\n value is evaluated from the dose response curve. The % inhibition is evaluated with the following formula:\n\n\n% inhibition = 100-[CPM(drug)/CPM(control)]xl00 where CPM(drug) is in units of counts per minute and is a number expressing the amount of radiolabeled ATP (g-\n33\n P) incorporated onto the RR-SRC peptide substrate by the enzyme after 30 minutes at 30 \n0\nC in the presence of test compound as measured by liquid scintillation counting. CPM(control) is in units of counts per minute and is a number expressing the amount of radiolabeled ATP (g-\n33\n P) incorporated into the RR-SRC peptide substrate by the enzyme after 30 minutes at 30 \n0\nC. in the absence of test compound as measured by liquid scintillation counting. The CPM values are corrected for the background counts produced by ATP in the absence of the enzymatic reaction. Compounds having an IC\n50\n of about 200 nM or less are considered to be significantly active EGFR inhibitors.\n\n\n[00172] The identification of EGFR as an oncogene has led to the development of anticancer therapeutics directed against EGFR, including gefitinib and cetuximab for colon cancer. Cetuximab is an example of a monoclonal antibody inhibitor, while gefitinib is a small molecule inhibitor. Monoclonal Antibodies [00173] The monoclonal antibodies block the extracellular ligand binding domain. With the binding site blocked, signal molecules can no longer attach there and activate the tyrosine kinase. [00174] Cetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody generated from fusion of the variable region of the murine anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody M225 and the human IgGl constant region. The resulting antibody retains high affinity and specificity to EGFR and reduces immunogenicity. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that cetuximab effectively inhibits the proliferation of a variety of EGFR- expressing cancer cells in vitro and that it inhibits tumor growth in xenograft models. In an orthotopic pancreatic cancer model, cetuximab significantly suppressed the growth of orthotopically implanted pancreatic tumors, and this effect was enhanced by the addition of gemcitabine. Histologic analysis of tumor specimens revealed that cetuximab induced apoptosis and suppressed proliferation of tumor cells. Interestingly, cetuximab also induced apoptosis of endothelial cells, which are not believed to be direct targets of EGFR inhibition. Moreover, an antiangiogenic effect, characterized by decreased microvascular densities associated with reduced expression of tumor-related VEGF and interleukin-8, was observed. These data suggest that, in addition to direct antiproliferative activity, antiangiogenic activity contributes significantly to the antitumor effect of EGFR inhibitors. [00175] Panitumumab (ABX-EGF) is a fully human monoclonal antibody specific to EGFR and is produced by immunization of transgenic mice, that are able to produce human immunoglobulin light \n\n and heavy chains. Following immunization, a specific clone of B cells that produced the antibody against EGFR are selected and immortalized for the generation of the antibody. {00176] Effective anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies compete with endogenous ligands, primarily EGF and transforming growth factor a for receptor ligand-binding sites. Binding to EGFR blocks critical signaling pathways and interferes with the growth of tumors expressing EGFR. Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies that are currently under study include EMD 55900 and ICR 62. Small Molecules\n\n\n[00177] Another method is using small molecules to inhibit the EGFR tyrosine kinase, which is on the cytoplasmic side of the receptor. Without kinase activity, EGFR is unable to activate itself, which is a prerequisite for binding of downstream adaptor proteins. Ostensibly by halting the signaling cascade in cells that rely on this pathway for growth, tumor proliferation and migration is diminished. [00178] Gefitinib is currently only indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients who have previously received chemotherapy. While gefitinib has yet to be proven to be effective in other cancers, there is potential for its use in the treatment of other cancers where EGFR overexpression is involved. Erlotinib\n\n\n[00179] N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-amine, also known as erlotinib (Tarceva®), is currently being used to help treat advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and in combination with gemcitabine in the treatment for advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer. U.S. 5,747,498 describes the preparation of erlotinib and other chemically-related compounds.\n\n\nAdditionally, U.S. 6,900,221 describes the use of a stable polymorph of erlotinib as an inhibitor of the erbB family of oncogenic and protoncogenic protein kinases such as EGFR. Also, the patent illustrates methods for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, pediatric malignancies, cervical and other tumors caused or promoted by human papilloma virus (HPV), melanoma, Barrett's esophagus (pre-malignant syndrome), adrenal and skin cancers and auto immune, neoplastic cutaneous diseases and atherosclerosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-amine Gemcitabine \n\n \n\n\n Gemcitabine\n\n\n[00180] Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog that exhibits antitumor activity. The chemical name for gemcitabine is β-2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorocytidine and is administered as the hydrochloride salt. The cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine is attributed to two actions. First, gemcitabine diphosphate inhibits ribonucleotide reductase causing a reduction in deoxynucleotides available for DNA synthesis.\n\n\nSecond, gemcitabine triphosphate competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA. The two actions working in combination lead to high levels of gemcitabine nuceotide incorportion into growing DNA chains. This leads to inhibition of further DNA synthesis and chain termination. [00181] Gemcitabine is indicated for use in the treatment of ovarian, breast, NSCL and pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine hydrochloride is administered as an intravenous infusion of a 1000 mg/m\n2\n dose over 30 minutes once a week for up to 7 weeks. This is followed by one week of rest and then subsequent cycles of weekly infusions for 3 weeks of a 4 week cycle. Complete details are provided in the prescribing instructions for gemcitabine, which is included by reference in its entirety.

[00221] In some other embodiments, the invention provides a method for treating cancer, tumors, and tumor-related disorders, comprising administering a composition comprising a combination of a 1,2- diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor described herein, wherein the combination has an effect that is greater than the additive effects of the effects of the 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative alone and the effects of the EGFR inhibitor alone, hi other embodiments, the invention provides method for treating cancer, tumors, and tumor-related disorders, comprising administering a composition comprising a combination of a 1 ,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor wherein the 1 ,2- diphenylpyrrole derivative is 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and the EGFR inhibitor is erlotinib, wherein the combination has an effect that is greater than the additive effects of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole alone and the effects of erlotinib alone. [00222] In some embodiments, the invention provides a method for treating cancer, tumors, and tumor-related disorders comprising administering a composition comprising a combination of a 1,2- diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor described herein, wherein the combination has an \n\n effect that is greater than the effects of the 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative alone (e.g., cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibition alone). In other embodiments, the invention provides a method for treating cancer, tumors, and tumor-related disorders comprising administering a composition comprising a combination of a 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor wherein the 1,2- diphenylpyrrole derivative is 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and the EGFR inhibitor is erlotinib, wherein the combination has an effect that is greater than the effects of is 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole alone.\n\n\n[00223] In further embodiments, the invention provides a method for treating cancer, tumors, and tumor-related disorders comprising administering a composition comprising a combination of a 1,2- diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor described herein, wherein the combination has an effect that is greater than the effects of the EGFR inhibitor alone (epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibition alone). In other embodiments, the invention provides a method for treating cancer, tumors, and tumor-related disorders comprising administering a composition comprising a combination of a 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor wherein the 1,2- diphenylpyrrole derivative is 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l -(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and the EGFR inhibitor is erlotinib, wherein the combination has an effect that is greater than the effects of erlotinib alone.\n\n\n[00224] Synergism of the composition comprising a combination of a 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor, may be used to obtain the desired effect at doses to which side effects are minimal. For example, a patient may be treated for a disease, disorder, or condition which benefits from EGFR inhibition, such as tumors, tumor-related diseases, cancer, neoplasia, while concomitantly being treated for a side effect of the EGFR inhibition, such as inflammation, through the benefit of the 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative inhibitor. Li one embodiment, the invention provides a combination of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and erlotinib which may be used to obtain the desired effect at doses to which side effects are minimal.\n\n\n[00225] The composition comprising a combination of a 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor, may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve one or more other materials and treatment agents such as but not limited to a combination of inhibitors of MMP (matrix-metallo-proteinase), other tyrosine kinases including VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), farnesyl transferase, CTLA\n4\n (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4) and erbB2, as well as MAb to VEGFr, and other cancer-related antibodies including rhuMAb-VEGF, the erbB2 MAb, or avb3. [00226] Thus, the composition comprising a combination of a 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor, may be applied with one or more other anti-tumor substances, for example, those selected from, mitotic inhibitors, for example vinblastine; alkylating agents, for example, cis-platin, carboplatin, and cyclophosphamide; anti-metabolites, for example 5-fluorouracil, cytosine arabinoside and hydroxyurea, or, for example, anti-metabolites such as N-(5-[N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4- oxoquinazolin-6-ylmethyl)-N-methylamino]-2 -thenoyl)-L-glutamic acid; growth factor inhibitors; cell \n\n cycle inhibitors; intercalating antibiotics, for example adriamycin and bleomycin; enzymes, for example interferon; and anti-hormones, for example anti-estrogens such as Nolvadex® (tamoxifen) or, for example anti-androgens such as Casodex® (4'-cyano-3-(4-fluorophenyl sulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2- methyl-3'-(trifluoromethyl)propionanilide). In one embodiment, the invention provides a combination a 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor wherein the 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative is 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and the EGFR inhibitor is erlotinib, may be applied with one or more other anti-tumor substances, for example, those selected from, mitotic inhibitors, for example vinblastine; alkylating agents, for example, cis-platin, carboplatin, and cyclophosphamide; anti-metabolites, for example 5-fluorouracil, cytosine arabinoside and hydroxyurea, or, for example, anti-metabolites such as N-(5-[N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4- oxoquinazolin-6-ylmethyl)-N-methylamino]-2 -thenoyl)-L-glutamic acid; growth factor inhibitors; cell cycle inhibitors; intercalating antibiotics, for example adriamycin and bleomycin; enzymes, for example interferon; and anti-hormones, for example anti-estrogens such as Nolvadex® (tamoxifen) or, for example anti-androgens such as Casodex® (4'-cyano-3-(4-fluorophenyl sulphonyl)-2 -hydroxy -2- methyl-3 '-(trifluoromethyl)propionanilide).\n\n\n[00227] For the combination therapies including combination therapies having pharmaceutical compositions described herein, the effective amounts of the compound presently described herein useful for inhibiting abnormal cell growth (e.g., other antiproliferative agent, anti-angiogenic, signal transduction inhibitor or immune- system enhancer) can be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art, based on the effective amounts for the compound described herein and those known or described for the chemotherapeutic or other agent. The formulations and routes of administration for such therapies and compositions can be based on the information described herein for compositions and therapies comprising the combinations presented herein as the sole active agent and on information provided for the chemotherapeutic or other agent in combination therewith. [00228] hi one embodiment, the invention provides a method for inhibiting abnormal cell growth in a subject comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a composition comprising a combination of a 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or prodrug thereof, in combination with radiation therapy effective in inhibiting abnormal cell growth in the subject. Techniques for administering radiation therapy are known to a person of skill in the art and these techniques can be used in the combination therapy described herein. Additional Therapy\n\n\n[00229] Available additional treatments for cancer that may be advantageously employed in combination with the therapies and compositions disclosed herein include, without limitation, surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant; hormone therapy, and monoclonal antibody therapy. [00230] Surgical procedure are often used in the treatment of cancer. \n\n [00231] Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\n\n\n[00232] Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the spinal column, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. [00233] Different chemotherapeutic agents are known in the art for treating cancer. Cytoxic agents used for treating cancer include doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C, mitoxantrone, paclitaxel, taxane formulations such as by way of example only, Abraxane® (ABI-007), Paclitaxel-Cremophor EL, Paclitaxel poliglumex, and Paclitaxel injectable emulsion (PIE), gemcitabine, docetaxel, capecitabine and epirubicin. [00234] Other chemotherapy against cancer includes treatment with one or more of bendamustine, carboplatin (for example, Paraplatin®), carmustine (for example, BCNU®), chlorambucil (for example, Leukeran®), cisplatin (for example, Platinol®), cyclophosphamide injection (for example, Cytoxan®), oral cyclophosphamide (for example, Cytoxan®), dacarbazine (for example, DTIC®), ifosfamide (for example, ifex®), lomustine (for example, CCNU®), mechlorethamine (for example, nitrogen mustard, Mustargen®), melphalan (for example, Alkeran®), procarbazine (for example, Matulane®), bleomycin (for example, Blenoxane®), doxorubicin (for example, Adriamycin®, Rubex®), epirubicin, Idarubicin (for example, Idamycin®), mitoxantrone (for example, Novantrone®), gemcitabine (for example, Gemzar®), oral mercaptopurine (for example, Purinethol®). methotrexate, pentostatin IV (for example, Nipent®), oral thioguanine (for example, Lanvis®), oral etoposide (for example, VP- 16, VePesid®, Etopophos) - etoposide IV (for example, VP- 16, VePesid®, Etopophos), vinblastine (for example, Velban®), vincristine (for example, Oncovin®), vinorelbine (for example, Navelbine®), dexamethasone (for example, Decadron®), methylprednisolone (for example, Medrol®), and prednisone (for example, Deltasone®). Erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine is indicated for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. [00235] Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies are also used in combination with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy. [00236] Trastuzumab (Herceptin®) is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the effects of the growth factor protein HER2, which transmits growth signals to breast cancer cells. \n\n [00237] Trastuzumab leads to clinical responses as a single agent and improves survival when added to chemotherapy for advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. However, some patients do not respond to trastuzumab, and most eventually develop clinical resistance. Mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired trastuzumab resistance are poorly understood. One study which utilized a cell line-based approach to delineate genetic and protein alterations associated with resistance has been reported. (D. Tripathy et al Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2005 VoI 23, No 16S, 3121. These researchers studied two HER2- positive breast cancer cell lines (BT474 and SKBR3) that were serially passaged in the presence of trastuzumab until in vitro resistance was documented. Resistant cell lines emerged after 12 months and exhibited a 3 -fold more rapid growth rate in the absence of trastuzumab. Following trastuzumab exposure, Go/Gi arrest was observed insensitive compared to resistant cells (84 vs. 68%), with fewer cells in S-phase (3 vs. 14%). Resistant cell lines exhibited fewer changes in gene expression with trastuzumab as well as upregulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and mitotic checkpoint regulators, and downregulation of PTEN compared to sensitive cells. [00238] Additional, illustrative, treatments that may be advantageously combined with the compositions and therapies disclosed herein may include, without limitation, administration of agents including, but not limited to capecitabine, docetaxel, epirubicin, epothilone A, B or D, goserelin acetate, paclitaxel, pamidronate, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab. EGFR Resistance [00239] Studies have shown that after a period of about 8-12 months of EGFR-directed treatments, the cancer cells become resistant to the treatment, most commonly by 1) recruiting a mutated IGF-I receptor to act as one of the EGFR partners in the homodimer, thus, forming a heterodimer (this allows the signal to be transmitted even in the presence of an EGFR inhibitor); 2) the presence of redundant tyrosine kinase receptors; 3) increased angiogenesis; 4) the constitutive activation of downstream mediators; and 5) the existence of specific EGFR mutations. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of resistance and sensitivity may lead to improvements in therapies that target EGFR.\n\n\n[0024O]IGF-IR activates many of the same downstream pathways as EGFR and can lead to tumorigenesis, increased proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. PI-3K/Akt signaling is a critical component of the downstream mediation of EGFR and also plays a functional role in IGF-IR signaling. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, this redundancy may explain how the receptors can mimic the function of one another. Chakravarti et al., identified two glioblastoma cell lines that each overexpressed EGFR but exhibited very different responses to EGFR inhibitors. The resistant cell line significantly overexpressed IGF-IR and showed further increases in IGF-IR expression in response to EGFR inhibition by AG1478, an EGFR TKI. PI-3K/Akt signaling persisted in these resistant cell lines in response to AG1478 treatment, and these cells also maintained their invasive and antiapoptotic characteristics. These studies support the concept of redundant signaling through IGF-IR that maintains activation of critical pathways for survival in the presence of EGFR \n\n inhibition. Inhibiting both IGF-IR and EGFR may significantly reduce the growth and invasiveness of cells that are resistant to EGFR inhibitors alone. Further evidence that IGF-IR activation may bypass inhibition of other tyrosine kinase receptors comes from a study by Luet al., who showed that the degree of overexpression of IGF- IR was inversely related to the response of breast cancer cells to trastuzumab, an antibody directed against ErbB2. SKBR3 human breast cancer cells, which normally overexpress HER2/neuand minimally express IGF-IR, showed a 42% decrease in proliferation in response to trastuzumab. Unlike the parental cell line\n\n\n[00241] , SKBR3 cells that were engineered to overexpress IGF-IR showed no response to trastuzumab. When the IGF-IR was inhibited by IGF-binding protein-3 in the engineered cell lines, the response to trastuzumab returned to normal. These studies clearly indicate that activation of alternative tyrosine kinase receptors in tumor cells may override the effect of EGFR family inhibitors. These examples suggest that a combination may be able to overcome resistance to a single receptor inhibitor and thus more effectively inhibit pathways leading to cancer growth and survival. Recently, an enhanced response was shown in breast cancer cell lines treated with either recombinant bispecifϊc antibodies to both EGFR and IGF-IR or a combination of single receptor antibodies compared with either antibody alone. Signaling pathways downstream of the receptors were also more effectively inhibited by the combination therapy. By combining therapies that attack multiple cell surface and intracellular signaling pathways, redundant receptor signaling might be blocked and greater clinical benefit achieved. Thus, identifying key downstream signaling molecules in which growth factor receptor signals converge may be important in the development of therapeutic agents that block signals from multiple activated growth factor receptors. Similarly, Jung et al. discloses the use of a combination of mAbs to EGFR and mAbs to VEGFR-2 to treat gastric cancer grown in nude mice. Both mAbs were modestly effective at inhibiting tumor growth, but the combination achieved significantly greater tumor growth inhibition that was also associated with decreased tumor vascularity and increased tumor cell apoptosis.\n\n\n[00242] In one embodiment the invention provides a method for treating a subject having an EGFR inhibitor resistant cancer cell comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising a 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative in combination with an EGFR inhibitor. In one embodiment, the 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative is 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl- 1 - (4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole. In another embodiment the 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative is 2-(4- ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and the EGFR inhibitor is erlotinib. [00243] In one embodiment the invention provides a method for sensitizing EGFR inhibitor resistant cancer cells to an EGFR inhibitor, the method comprising administering a combination comprising a 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor wherein the combination sensitizes the cancer cells to the EGFR inhibitor. In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for sensitizing\n\n\nEGFR inhibitor resistant cancer cells to erlotinib, the method comprising administering a combination \n\n comprising a 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and erlotinib wherein the combination sensitizes the cancer cells erlotinib. Lung Cancer\n\n\n[00244] In many countries including Japan, Europe and America, the number of patients with lung cancer is fairly large and continues to increase year after year and is the most frequent cause of cancer death in both men and women. Although there are many potential causes for lung cancer, tobacco use, and particularly cigarette smoking, is the most important. Additionally, etiologic factors such as exposure to asbestos, especially in smokers, or radon are contributory factors. Also occupational hazards such as exposure to uranium have been identified as an important factor. Finally, genetic factors have also been identified as another factor that increases the risk of cancer.\n\n\n[00245] Lung cancers can be histologically classified into non-small cell lung cancers (e.g. squamous cell carcinoma (epidermoid), adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma (large cell anaplastic), etc.) and small cell lung cancer (oat cell). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has different biological properties and responses to chemotherapeutics from those of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Thus, chemotherapeutic formulas and radiation therapy are different between these two types of lung cancer. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\n\n\n[00246] Where the location of the non-small cell lung cancer tumor can be easily excised (stage I and II disease) surgery is the first option of therapy and offers a relatively good chance for a cure. In more advanced disease (stage Ilia and greater), however, where the tumor has extended to tissue beyond the bronchopulmonary lymph nodes, surgery may not lead to complete excision of the tumor. In such cases, the patient's chance for a cure by surgery alone is greatly diminished. Where surgery will not provide complete removal of the NSCLC tumor, other types of therapies must be utilized. Today, chemoradiation therapy, is the standard treatment to control unresectable or inoperable NSCLC. Improved results have been seen when radiation therapy has been combined with chemotherapy, but gains have been modest and the search continues for improved methods of combining modalities.\n\n\n[00247] Radiation therapy is based on the principle that high-dose radiation delivered to a target area will result in the death of reproductive cells in both tumor and normal tissues. The radiation dosage regimen is generally defined in terms of radiation absorbed dose (rad), time and fractionation, and must be carefully defined by the oncologist. The amount of radiation a patient receives will depend on various consideration but the two most important considerations are the location of the tumor in relation to other critical structures or organs of the body, and the extent to which the tumor has spread. One course of treatment for a patient undergoing radiation therapy for NSCLC will be a treatment schedule over a 5 to 6 week period, with a total dose of 50 to 60 Gy administered to the patient in a single daily fraction of 1.8 to 2.0 Gy, 5 days a week. A Gy is an abbreviation for Gray and refers to 100 rad of dose.\n\n\n[00248] As NSCLC is a systemic disease, however, and radiation therapy is a local modality, radiation therapy as a single mode of therapy is unlikely to provide a cure for NSCLC, at least for those tumors \n\n that have metastasized distantly outside the zone of treatment. Thus, the use of radiation therapy with other modality regimens has important beneficial effects for the treatment of NSCLC. [00249] Generally, radiation therapy has been combined temporally with chemotherapy to improve the outcome of treatment. There are various terms to describe the temporal relationship of administering radiation therapy in combination with COX-2 inhibitors and chemotherapy, and the following examples are the treatment regimens and are provided for illustration only and are not intended to limit the use of other combinations. \"Sequential\" therapy refers to the administration of a composition comprising a combination of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and erlotinib and/or radiation therapy separately in time in order to allow the separate administration of the composition, and/or radiation therapy. \"Concomitant\" therapy refers to the administration of the composition, and/or radiation therapy on the same day.\n\n\n[00250] Finally, \"alternating\" therapy refers to the administration of radiation therapy on the days in which the composition would not have been administered if it was given alone. It is reported that advanced non-small cell lung cancers do not respond favorably to single-agent chemotherapy and useful therapies for advanced inoperable cancers have been limited. (Journal of Clinical Oncology, vol. 10, pp. 829-838 (1992)).\n\n\n[00251] Japanese Patent Kokai 5-163293 refers to some specified antibiotics of 16-membered-ring macrolides as a drug delivery carrier capable of transporting anthracycline-type anticancer drugs into the lungs for the treatment of lung cancers. Thus, the use of a composition comprising a combination of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and erlotinib and a macrolide as a drug delivery carrier is contemplated herein for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. [00252] Several chemotherapeutic agents have been shown to be efficacious against NSCLC. Chemotherapeutic agents that can be used in the present disclosure against NSCLC include cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, taxane formulations such as by way of example only, Abraxane® (AB 1-007), Paclitaxel-Cremophor EL, Paclitaxel poliglumex, and Paclitaxel injectable emulsion (PIE), gemcitabine, navelbine, pemetrexate, etoposide, methotrexate, 5-Fluorouracil, epirubicin, doxorubicin, vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, mitomycin C, epirubicin, vindesine, camptothecins, fotemustine, and edatrexate. [00253] In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of the treatment of NSCLC which utilizes a therapeutically effective amounts of a composition comprising a combination of 2-(4- ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and erlotinib. Further, therapy for the treatment of NSCLC utilizes a therapeutically effective amounts of a composition comprising a combination of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole with erlotinib, and one of the following antineoplastic agents: bevacizumab, docetaxel, gefitinib, gemcitabine, cisplatin, carboplatin, etoposide, paclitaxel, pemetrexate, vinorelbine, or radiation therapy. \n\n Small Cell Lung Cancer\n\n\n[00254] Approximately 15 to 20 percent of all cases of lung cancer reported worldwide are small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Hide DC: Cancer 54:2722, 1984. Currently, treatment of SCLC incorporates multi-modal therapy, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Response rates of localized or disseminated SCLC remain high to systemic chemotherapy, however, persistence of the primary tumor and persistence of the tumor in the associated lymph nodes has led to the integration of several therapeutic modalities in the treatment of SCLC.\n\n\n[00255] Therapy for the treatment of lung cancer according to one embodiment of the invention utilizes a combination of therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising a combination of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl- 1 -(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and erlotinib. In another embodiment, therapy for the treatment of lung cancer according to the invention utilizes a combination of therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising a combination of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4- methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and erlotinib and one of the following antineoplastic agents: vincristine, docetaxel, camptothecin, topotecan cisplatin, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, epirubicin (high dose), etoposide (VP-16) I. V., etoposide (VP- 16) oral, isofamide, teniposide (VM-26), doxorubicin, and amrubicin. Other preferred single-agents chemotherapeutic agents that may be used in the present disclosure include BCNU (carmustine), vindesine, hexamethylmelamine (altretamine), methotrexate, nitrogen mustard, and CCNU (lomustine). Other chemotherapeutic agents under investigation that have shown activity against SCLC include iroplatin, gemcitabine, Ionidamine, and taxol. Glioma\n\n\n[00256] A glioma is a type of primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor that arises from glial cells. The most common site of involvement of gliomas is the brain, but they can also affect the spinal cord or any other part of the CNS, such as the optic nerves. Treatment for brain gliomas depends on the location and the grade. Often, treatment is a combined approach, using surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The radiation therapy is in the form of external beam radiation or the stereotactic approach using radiosurgery. Spinal cord tumors can be treated by surgery and radiation. Temozolomide is a chemotherapeutic drug that is able to cross the blood-brain barrier effectively and is being used in therapy. [00257] EGFR is frequently amplified, overexpressed, or mutated in glioblastomas, but gnereally only 10 to 20 % of patients have a response to EGFR inhibitors. It has been shown that glioblastoma that overexpresses the EGFRvIII oncogene and are PTEN tumor suppressor wildtype are sensitive to erlotinib treatment. [00258] Therapy for the treatment of glioma according to one embodiment of the invention utilizes a combination of therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising a combination of 2-(4- ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and erlotinib. In another embodiment, therapy for the treatment of glioma according to the invention utilizes a combination of therapeutically \n\n effective amount of a composition comprising a combination of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4- sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and erlotinib and temozolomide. Head and Neck Cancer\n\n\n[00259] Head and neck cancer includes cancers of the mouth, nose, sinuses, salivary glands, throat and lymph nodes in the neck. Most begin in the moist tissues that line the mouth, nose and throat. Symptoms include a lump or sore that does not heal, a sore throat that does not go away, trouble swallowing and a change or hoarseness in the voice. Using tobacco or alcohol increases cancer risk. Treatments of head and neck cancer may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or a combination. Treatments can affect eating, speaking or even breathing, so patients may need rehabilitation.\n\n\n[00260] Head and neck cancer is often complex, with many different sites and staging systems. However, current therapy offers several alternatives, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, either alone or in combination. [00261] Combined modality therapy is becoming the principal method of treating patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers. Meanwhile, researchers are actively investigating new treatments such as gene therapy. Newer chemotherapy agents (e.g., paclitaxel [Taxol®], docetaxel [Taxotere®], gemcitabine [Gemzar®], doxorubicin [Doxil®]) may be combined with established chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., methotrexate [Trexall®, Methotrex®]) to improve results. [00262] In March 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved cetuximab (Erbitux®), in combination with radiation, for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck that cannot be treated surgically. Cetuximab also may be used alone (called monotherapy) in patients with head and neck cancer that has spread (metastasized) following standard chemotherapy. [00263] Therapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer according to one embodiment of the invention utilizes a combination of therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising a combination of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and erlotinib. In another embodiment,therapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer according to the invention utilizes a combination of therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising a combination of 2-(4- ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and erlotinib and one or more chemotherapy agents (e.g., paclitaxel [Taxol®], docetaxel [Taxotere®], gemcitabine [Gemzar®], doxorubicin [Doxil®]) which may be further combined with established chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., methotrexate [Trexall®, Methotrex®]). In another embodiment, therapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer according to the invention utilizes a combination of therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising a combination of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)- pyrrole and erlotinib and Erbitux®. Colorectal Cancer\n\n\n[00264] COX-2 expression levels correlate with survival rates in colorectal cancer (see Figure 1.) Survival from colorectal cancer depends on the stage and grade of the tumor, for example precursor \n\n adenomas to metastatic adenocarcinoma. Generally, colorectal cancer can be treated by surgically removing the tumor, but overall survival rates remain between 45 and 60 percent. Colonic excision morbidity rates are fairly low and are generally associated with the anastomosis and not the extent of the removal of the tumor and local tissue. In patients with a high risk of reoccurrence, however, chemotherapy has been incorporated into the treatment regimen in order to improve survival rates.\n\n\n[00265] Tumor metastasis prior to surgery is generally believed to be the cause of surgical intervention failure and up to one year of chemotherapy is required to kill the non-excised tumor cells. As severe toxicity is associated with the chemotherapeutic agents, only patients at high risk of recurrence are placed on chemotherapy following surgery. Thus, the incorporation of an antiangiogenesis inhibitor into the management of colorectal cancer plays an important role in the treatment of colorectal cancer and lead to overall improved survival rates for patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer.

It is further understood that for any particular individual, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the formulations.\n\n\n[00300] hi the case wherein the patient's condition does not improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the combinations may be administered chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout the duration of the patient's life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient's disease or condition. [00301] hi the case wherein the patient's status does improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the combinations may be given continuously or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a \"drug holiday\").\n\n\n[00302] Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, can be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. Patients can, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.\n\n\n[00303] As described herein, the compositions and methods for using the composition comprising a combination of a 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor, may be formulated without carriers or excipients or may be combined with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for administration. For example, solvents, diluents and the like, and may be administered orally in such forms as tablets, capsules, dispersible powders, granules, or suspensions containing, for example, from \n\n about 0.05 to about 5% of suspending agent, syrups containing, for example, from about 10 to about 50% of sugar, and elixirs containing, for example, from about 20 to about 50% ethanol, and the like. Such pharmaceutical preparations may contain, for example, from about 0.05 up to about 90% of the active ingredient in combination with the carrier, more usually between about 5% and about 60% by weight. Also, the compositions and methods for using the composition comprising a combination of a 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative and an EGFR inhibitor wherein the 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative is 2- (4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and the EGFR inhibitor is erlotinib, may be formulated without carriers or excipients or may be combined with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for administration. [00304] The effective dosage of each active ingredient employed may vary depending on the particular compound employed, the mode of administration and the severity of the condition being treated. The projected daily dosage of the EGFR inhibitor will depend on many factors. Numerous methods for evaluating and comparing 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative inhibitor potency are known to one of skill in the art. In one embodiment, an oral daily dosage of the 1,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative inhibitor is in the range of about 0.01 to about 30 mg/kg, and the projected daily dosage of the EGFR inhibitor is in the range of about 0.3 to about 8 mg/kg. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. The 1,2- diphenylpyrrole derivative inhibitor and the EGFR inhibitor may also be administered as a combined dosage unit, or as separate components. When administered as separate components, each component may be administered at the same time, or at different times during the treatment period. [00305] It is understood, however, that a specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors such as, for example, decreases in the liver and kidney function. [00306] Treatment dosages generally may be titrated to optimize safety and efficacy. Typically, dosage-effect relationships from in vitro studies initially can provide useful guidance on the proper doses for patient administration. Studies in animal models also generally may be used for guidance regarding effective dosages for treatment of cancers in accordance with the present disclosure. In terms of treatment protocols, it should be appreciated that the dosage to be administered will depend on several factors, including the particular agent that is administered, the route administered, the condition of the particular patient, etc. Determination of these parameters are well within the skill of the art. These considerations, as well as effective formulations and administration procedures are well known in the art and are described in standard textbooks. Oral Formulations [00307] Oral formulations containing the active combinations described herein may comprise any conventionally used oral forms, including: tablets, capsules, pills, troches, lozenges, pastilles, cachets, pellets, medicated chewing gum, granules, bulk powders, effervescent or non-effervescent powders or granules, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, solutions, wafers, sprinkles, elixirs, syrups, buccal forms, \n\n and oral liquids. Capsules may contain mixtures of the active compound(s) with inert fillers and/or diluents such as the pharmaceutically acceptable starches (e.g. corn, potato or tapioca starch), sugars, artificial sweetening agents, powdered celluloses, such as crystalline and microcrystalline celluloses, flours, gelatins, gums, etc. Useful tablet formulations may be made by conventional compression, wet granulation or dry granulation methods and utilize pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, binding agents, lubricants, disintegrants, surface modifying agents (including surfactants), suspending or stabilizing agents, including, but not limited to, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc, sodium lauryl sulfate, microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, alginic acid, acacia gum, xanthan gum, sodium citrate, complex silicates, calcium carbonate, glycine, dextrin, sucrose, sorbitol, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, lactose, kaolin, mannitol, sodium chloride, talc, dry starches and powdered sugar.

Oral formulations herein may utilize standard delay or time release formulations to alter the absorption of the active compound(s). The oral formulation may also consist of administering the active ingredient in water or a fruit juice, containing appropriate solubilizers or emulsifϊers as needed. Oral Administration [00308] As described herein, the combination regimen can be given simultaneously or can be given in a staggered regimen, with a 1 ,2-diphenylpyrrole derivative being given at a different time during the course of chemotherapy than an EGFR inhibitor. This time differential may range from several minutes, hours, days, weeks, or longer between administration of the two compounds. Therefore, the term combination does not necessarily mean administered at the same time or as a unitary dose, but that each of the components are administered during a desired treatment period. The agents may also be administered by different routes. As is typical for chemotherapeutic regimens, a course of chemotherapy may be repeated several weeks later, and may follow the same timeframe for administration of the two compounds, or may be modified based on patient response.

The semipermeable membrane controls the influx of water to the core from an aqueous environment of use so as to cause drug release by extrusion through the delivery port(s). [00345] In addition to the active ingredient(s), the core of the osmotic device optionally includes an osmotic agent, which creates a driving force for transport of water from the environment of use into the core of the device. One class of osmotic agents water-swellable hydrophilic polymers, which are also referred to as \"osmopolymers\" and \"hydrogels,\" including, but not limited to, hydrophilic vinyl and acrylic polymers, polysaccharides such as calcium alginate, polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic) acid, poly(methacrylic) acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), crosslinked PVP, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA/PVP copolymers, PVA/PVP copolymers with hydrophobic monomers such as methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, hydrophilic polyurethanes containing large PEO blocks, sodium croscarmellose, carrageenan, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and carboxyethyl, cellulose (CEC), sodium alginate, polycarbophil, gelatin, xanthan gum, and sodium starch glycolate. \n\n [00346] The other class of osmotic agents are osmogens, which are capable of imbibing water to affect an osmotic pressure gradient across the barrier of the surrounding coating. Suitable osmogens include, but are not limited to, inorganic salts, such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, lithium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium phosphates, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfite, lithium sulfate, potassium chloride, and sodium sulfate; sugars, such as dextrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, lactose, maltose, mannitol, raffinose, sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and xylitol; organic acids, such as ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, sebacic acid, sorbic acid, adipic acid, edetic acid, glutamic acid, p-tolunesulfonic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid; urea; and mixtures thereof. [00347] Osmotic agents of different dissolution rates may be employed to influence how rapidly the active ingredient(s) is initially delivered from the dosage form. For example, amorphous sugars, such as Mannogeme EZ (SPI Pharma, Lewes, DE) can be used to provide faster delivery during the first couple of hours to promptly produce the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of the remaining amount to maintain the desired level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time, hi this case, the active ingredient(s) is released at such a rate to replace the amount of the active ingredient metabolized and excreted.\n\n\n[00348] The core may also include a wide variety of other excipients and carriers as described herein to enhance the performance of the dosage form or to promote stability or processing. [00349] Materials useful in forming the semi-permeable membrane include various grades of acrylics, vinyls, ethers, polyamides, polyesters, and cellulosic derivatives that are water-permeable and water- insoluble at physiologically relevant pHs, or are susceptible to being rendered water-insoluble by chemical alteration, such as crosslinking. Examples of suitable polymers useful in forming the coating, include plasticized, unplasticized, and reinforced cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, CA propionate, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CA ethyl carbamate, CAP, CA methyl carbamate, CA succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), CA dimethylaminoacetate, CA ethyl carbonate, CA chloroacetate, CA ethyl oxalate, CA methyl sulfonate, CA butyl sulfonate, CA p-toluene sulfonate, agar acetate, amylose triacetate, beta glucan acetate, beta glucan triacetate, acetaldehyde dimethyl acetate, triacetate of locust bean gum, hydroxylated ethylene- vinylacetate, EC, PEG, PPG, PEG/PPG copolymers, PVP, HEC, HPC, CMC, CMEC, HPMC, HPMCP, HPMCAS, HPMCAT, poly(acrylic) acids and esters and poly-(methacrylic) acids and esters and copolymers thereof, starch, dextran, dextrin, chitosan, collagen, gelatin, polyalkenes, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. [00350] Semi-permeable membrane may also be a hydrophobic microporous membrane, wherein the pores are substantially filled with a gas and are not wetted by the aqueous medium but are permeable to water vapor, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,119. Such hydrophobic but water-vapor permeable membrane are typically composed of hydrophobic polymers such as polyalkenes, polyethylene, \n\n polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyacrylic acid derivatives, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes.\n\n\n[00351] The delivery port(s) on the semi-permeable membrane may be formed post-coating by mechanical or laser drilling. Delivery port(s) may also be formed in situ by erosion of a plug of water- soluble material or by rupture of a thinner portion of the membrane over an indentation in the core. In addition, delivery ports may be formed during coating process, as in the case of asymmetric membrane coatings of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,612,059 and 5,698,220. [00352] The total amount of the active ingredient(s) released and the release rate can substantially by modulated via the thickness and porosity of the semi-permeable membrane, the composition of the core, and the number, size, and position of the delivery ports.\n\n\n[00353] The pharmaceutical compositions in an osmotic controlled-release dosage form may further comprise additional conventional excipients or carriers as described herein to promote performance or processing of the formulation. [00354] The osmotic controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art {see, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, supra; Santus and Baker, J.

See, for example, Multiparticulate Oral Drug Delivery; Marcel Dekker: 1994; and Pharmaceutical Pelletization Technology; Marcel Dekker: 1989. [00358] Other excipients or carriers as described herein may be blended with the pharmaceutical compositions to aid in processing and forming the multiparticulates. The resulting particles may themselves constitute the multiparticulate device or may be coated by various film-forming materials, such as enteric polymers, water-swellable, and water-soluble polymers.

Peak plasma concentrations were achieved between 1 and 3 hours after a dose of 5 mg/kg. The elimination half life (t y\n2\n) was 4-5 hours in rodents and dogs, and approximately 2 hours in monkeys. Oral availability was greatest in rodent, and was reduced in dogs and monkeys (59 and 34% respectively). Pharmacokinetics in human subjects demonstrated a linear dose exposure relationship from doses of 2 mg to 800 mg given orally. The half-life in human subjects is 15-18 hours.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nToxicology of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl- 1 -(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole [00379] Toxicological evaluation of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl- 1 -(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys revealed expected findings related to inhibition of cyclooxygenase and consistent with animal safety observations with other COX-2 selective inhibitors. In single dose studies, the minimum lethal dose of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole was 600 mg/kg in rats and >2000 mg/kg in dogs. An endoscopy study conducted in human subjects demonstrated no increase in gastric or duodenal toxicity compared to placebo. \n\n Example 5\n\n\nBiological Evaluation COX-2 Selective Inhibitors HT-29 Model: [00380] Mice are injected subcutaneously in the left paw (IxIO\n6\n tumor cells suspended in 30% Matrigel) and tumor volume is evaluated using a phlethysmometer twice a week for 30-60 days. Implantation of human colon cancer cells (HT-29) into nude mice produces tumors that will reach 0.6- 2 ml between 30-50 days. Blood is drawn twice during the experiment in a 24 h protocol to assess plasma concentration and total exposure by AUC analysis. The data is expressed as the mean+/-SEM. Student's and Mann- Whitney tests are used to assess differences between means using the InStat software package.\n\n\n[00381] A. Mice injected with HT-29 cancer cells are treated with cytoxin i.p at doses of 50 mg/kg on days 5, 7 and 9 in the presence or absence of a composition comprising a combination of 2-(4- ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole with erlotinib in the diet. The efficacy of both agents are determined by measuring tumor volume. The results from these studies may demonstrate that a composition comprising a combination of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)- pyrrole with erlotinib administered in the diet to tumor bearing mice can delay the growth of tumors and metastasis when administered as sole therapy. [00382] B. In a second assay, mice are injected with HT-29 cancer cells are then treated with 5-FU on days 12 through 15. Mice injected with HT-29 cancer cells are treated with 5-FU i.p at doses of 50 mg/kg on days 12, 13, 14, and 15 in the presence or absence of a composition comprising a combination of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole with erlotinib in the diet. The efficacy of both agents are determined by measuring tumor volume. Treatment using the composition may reduce tumor volume by up to 70%. In the same assay, 5-FU decreases tumor volume by 61%. Further, the composition and 5-FU may decrease tumor volume by 83%.\n\n\n[00383] C. In a third assay, mice injected with HT-29 colon cancer cells are treated with 5-FU i.p 50 mg/kg on days 14 through 17 in the presence or absence of a composition comprising a combination of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole with erlotinib (1600 ppm) and valdecoxib (160 ppm) in the diet. The efficacy of both agents are determined by measuring tumor volume. Treatment with 5-FU may result in a 35% reduction in tumor volume. Treatment with the composition and valdecoxib may reduce tumor volume by 52% and 69%, respectively. In the same assay, the combination of 5-FU and the composition may decrease tumor volume by 72% while the combination of 5-FU and valdecoxib may decrease tumor volume by 74%.\n\n\nExample 6 In Vitro Inhibition of EGFR Kinase Activity\n\n\n[00384] The in vitro activity of the combinations described herein in inhibiting the receptor tyrosine kinase may be determined by the following procedure. The activity of the combinations of the present \n\n disclosure, in vitro, can be determined by the amount of inhibition of the phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate (e.g., Lys\n3\n — Gastrin or polyGluTyr (4: 1) random copolymer (Posner et al., J Biol. Chem., 1992, 267 (29), 20638-472)) on tyrosine by epidermal growth factor receptor kinase by a test compound relative to a control. Affinity purified, soluble human EGF receptor (96 ng) is obtained according to the procedure in G. N. Gill, W. Weber, Methods in Enzymology, 1987, 146, 82-8 from A431 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md.) and preincubated in a microfuge tube with EGF (2 μg/ml) in phosphorylation buffer+vanadate (PBV: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 125 mM NaCl; 24 mM MgCl\n2\n; 100 μM sodium orthovanadate), in a total volume of 10 μl, for 20-30 minutes at room temperature. The composition comprising a combination of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4- sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole with erlotinib, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), is diluted in PBV, and 10 μl is mixed with the EGF receptor/EGF mix, and incubated for 10-30 minutes at 30 \n0\nC. The phosphorylation reaction is initiated by addition of 20 μl \n33\n P-ATP/substrate mix (120 μM LyS\n3\n - Gastrin (sequence in single letter code for amino acids, KKKGP WLEEEEEA YG WLDF), 50 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 40 μM ATP, 2 pCi .gamma.-[\n33\n P]-ATP) to the EGFr/EGF mix and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. The reaction is stopped by addition of 10 μl stop solution (0.5 M\n\n\nEDTA, pH 8; 2 mM ATP) and 6 μl 2N HCl. The tubes are centrifuged at 14,000 RPM, 4 °C, for 10 minutes. 35 μl of supernatant from each tube is pipetted onto a 2.5 cm circle of Whatman P81 paper, bulk washed four times in 5% acetic acid, 1 liter per wash, and then air dried. This results in the binding of substrate to the paper with loss of free ATP on washing. The [\n33\n P] incorporated is measured by liquid scintillation counting. Incorporation in the absence of substrate (e.g., Iys\n3\n-gastrin) is subtracted from all values as a background and percent inhibition is calculated relative to controls without the composition present. Such assays, carried out with a range of doses of test combinations, allow the determination of an approximate IC\n50\n value for the in vitro inhibition of EGFR kinase activity. Other methods for determining the activity of the combinations presented herein are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,498, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein.\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions and Dosage Forms\n\n\n[00385] Dosage formulations comprising pharmaceutical excipients and carriers and a pharmaceutical composition comprising a combination of erlotinib (A) and 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4- sulfamoylphenyl)-ρyrrole (B) include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00386] Dosage formulations described herein, including the formulations set forth in the above table, may be administered in a single fixed dose comprising a combination of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl- l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and erlotinib or as a separate administration of a single dose of 2-(4- ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole and a single dose of erlotinib.\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nBiological Evaluation COX-2 Selective Inhibitors A431 Squamous Vulvar Carcinoma Model\n\n\nMice are injected subcutaneously in the left paw (IxIO\n6\n tumor cells suspended in 30% Matrigel) and tumor volume is evaluated using a phlethysmometer twice a week for 30-60 days. Implantation of squamous vulvar carcinoma (A431) into nude mice produces tumors that reach 0.6-2 ml between 30- 50 days. Blood is drawn twice during the experiment in a 24 h protocol to assess plasma concentration and total exposure by AUC analysis. The data is expressed as the mean+/-SEM. Student's and Mann- Whitney tests are used to assess differences between means using the InStat software package.\n\n\nMice injected with A431 cancer cells are treated with a composition comprising one of the following: 1. erlotinib (75 or 100 mg/kg ); 2. 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole (3, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg); 3. celecoxib (10, 30, 100, or 300 mg/kg); 4. erlotinib (75 mg/kg) and 2-(4- ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg); 4. erlotinib (75 mg/kg) and celecoxib (10, 30, or 100 mg/kg). The efficacy is determined by measuring tumor volume. The results from these studies, shown in Figure 3, demonstrate that a composition comprising a combination of 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-l-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-pyrrole with erlotinib administered to tumor bearing mice delayed the growth of tumors by 55% compared to erlotinib alone.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to Histamine H4 receptor antagonists or inhibitors of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression for the treatment and/or the prevention of a vestibular disorder.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nVestibular (inner ear) disorders can cause dizziness, vertigo, imbalance, hearing changes, nausea, fatigue, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and other symptoms, with potentially devastating effects on a person's day-to-day functioning, ability to work, relationships with family and friends, and quality of life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-histaminergic compounds are widely used as treatments against vestibular disorders, like vertigos. Histaminergic agonists and antagonists act on the vestibular system both peripherally and centrally, and could interfere with the recovery process after peripheral vestibular lesion (Lacour and Sterkers, 2001). Over the four histamine receptors (HR1 to HR4) HR3 appeared to regulate the vestibular inputs (Chavez 2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the field of the histaminergic treatment of vertigo, betahistine (BH) is one of the broad range of antivertiginous compound. The facilitator action of BH has been described in central vestibular compensation (Lacour and Sterkers, 2001; Tighilet et al. 2005), but its effects on peripheral vestibular receptors has only been reported in lower vertebrates (Housley et al. 1988; Tomoda et al. 1997; Botta et al. 1998; Soto et al. 2001; Chavez et al. 2005). BH has been reported to present a complex function as an agonist of H1 histaminic receptor, and as an antagonist of the H3 receptor (Arrang et al. 1985). In the peripheral vestibular receptors isolated from axolotl, BH inhibits the afferent discharge with an IC50 of 800 µM and a maximum effect around 10 mM (Chavez 2005). These studies concluded that histamine H3 receptor was the main target of BH (Van Cauwenberge PB and De Moor 1997; Soto 2001; Chavez 2005). A recent study realized in cultured rat vestibular neurons, maintained 7 days in vitro, reveals that the application of BH induced a reversible depolarisation of the neuron's membrane and inhibited the evoked discharge without affecting the intrinsic properties of the action potentials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, no investigation on Histamine H4 receptor has been made on vestibular disorder.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a Histamine H4 receptor antagonist for the treatment and/or the prevention of a vestibular disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to an inhibitor of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression for the treatment and/or the prevention of a vestibular disorder.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe term \"Histamine H4 receptor\" has its general meaning in the art. The term may include naturally occurring Histamine H4 receptors and variants and modified forms thereof. The Histamine H4 receptor can be from any source, but typically is a mammalian (e.g., human and non-human primate) Histamine H4 receptor, particularly a human Histamine H4 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"inhibitor of gene expression\" refers to a natural or synthetic compound that has a biological effect to inhibit or significantly reduce the expression of a gene. Consequently an \"inhibitor of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression\" refers to a natural or synthetic compound that has a biological effect to inhibit or significantly reduce the expression of the gene encoding for the Histamine H4 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"receptor antagonist\" is meant a natural or synthetic compound that has a biological effect opposite to that of a receptor agonist. The term is used indifferently to denote a \"true\" antagonist and an inverse agonist of a receptor. A \"true\" receptor antagonist is a compound which binds the receptor and blocks the biological activation of the receptor, and thereby the action of the receptor agonist, for example, by competing with the agonist for said receptor. An inverse agonist is a compound which binds to the same receptor as the agonist but exerts the opposite effect. Inverse agonists have the ability to decrease the constitutive level of receptor activation in the absence of an agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"Histamine H4 receptor antagonist\" includes any chemical entity that, upon administration to a patient, results in inhibition or down-regulation of a biological activity associated with activation of the Histamine H4 receptor in the patient, including any of the downstream biological effects otherwise resulting from the binding to Histamine H4 receptor of its natural ligand. Such Histamine H4 receptor antagonists include any agent that can block Histamine H4 receptor activation or any of the downstream biological effects of Histamine H4 receptor activation. For example, such a Histamine H4 receptor antagonist can act by occupying the ligand binding site or a portion thereof of the Histamine H4 receptor, thereby making the receptor inaccessible to its natural ligand so that its normal biological activity is prevented or reduced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the context of the present invention, Histamine H4 receptor antagonists are preferably selective for the Histamine H4 receptor as compared with the other histamine receptors, such as histamine H1 receptor, histamine H2 receptor, and histamine H3 receptor. By \"selective\" it is meant that the affinity of the antagonist for the Histamine H4 receptor is at least 10-fold, preferably 25-fold, more preferably 100-fold, still preferably 500-fold higher than the affinity for the other histamine receptor (H1, H2 and H3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe affinity of an antagonist for Histamine H4 receptor may be quantified by measuring the activity of Histamine H4 receptor in the presence a range of concentrations of said antagonist in order to establish a dose-response curve. From that dose response curve, an IC\n50\n value may be deduced which represents the concentration of antagonist necessary to inhibit 50% of the response to an agonist in defined concentration. The IC\n50\n value may be readily determined by the one skilled in the art by fitting the dose-response plots with a dose-response equation as described by De Lean et al. (1979). IC\n50\n values can be converted into affinity constant (Ki) using the assumptions of Cheng and Prusoff (1973).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, a Histamine H4 receptor antagonist is a compound for which at least one of the ratios (i) K\ni\n H3 : K\ni\n H4, and (ii) IC\n50\n H3: IC\n50\n H4, is above 10:1, preferably 25:1, more preferably 100:1, still preferably 1000:1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antagonistic activity of compounds towards the Histamine H4 receptors may be determined using various methods, such as those described in Thurmond RL et al. (2004) or Venable JD. et al. (2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"small organic molecule\" refers to a molecule of a size comparable to those organic molecules generally used in pharmaceuticals. The term excludes biological macromolecules (e. g., proteins, nucleic acids, etc.). Preferred small organic molecules range in size up to about 5000 Da, more preferably up to 2000 Da, and most preferably up to about 1000 Da.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"subject\" denotes a mammal, such as a rodent, a feline, a canine, and a primate. Preferably, a subject according to the invention is a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"vestibular disorder\" refers to a condition characterized by a condition characterized by dizziness, visual or gaze disturbances and balance impairment. Vestibular disorders could result from diverse damages or dysfunction of the inner ear, among them the acute and chronic syndromes. Examples of vestibular disorders that are contemplated by the invention include but are not limited to vertigo, benign paroxysmal vertigo, vestibular neuritis, spell of Ménière's disease, endolymphatic hydrops, perilymphatic fistula, head trauma with vestibular disorders, labyrinthine haemorrhage, chronic or acute labyrinthine infection, serous labyrinthine, barotraumatism, autoimmune inner ear disease, migraine with vestibular syndromes, vestibular syndromes after chirurgical treatments of middle ear, middle ear, endolymphatic sac or pontocerebellar angle, inner ear channelopathies, chronic Menière disease, vestibular, schwannomas, presbyvestibulia, familial episodic vertigo and ataxia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn its broadest meaning, the term \"treating\" or \"treatment\" refers to reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing the disorder or condition to which such term applies, or one or more symptoms of such disorder or condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, \"prevention\" of vestibular disorders may refer to the administration of the compounds of the present invention prevent the symptoms of vestibular disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Pharmaceutically\" or \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" refers to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce an adverse, allergic or other untoward reaction when administered to a mammal, especially a human, as appropriate. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient refers to a non-toxic solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherapeutic methods and uses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods and compositions (such as pharmaceutical compositions) for treating vestibular disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a first aspect, the invention relates to a Histamine H4 receptor antagonist for treating a vestibular disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the Histamine H4 receptor antagonist may be a low molecular weight antagonist, e. g. a small organic molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary Histamine H4 antagonists that are contemplated by the invention include but are not limited to those described in \n \nUS Patent No. 6,803,362\n \n; \n \nUS Patent Application Publication Nos. 2004/0105856\n \n, \n \n2004/0127395\n \n, \n \n2004/0132715\n \n, \n \n2004/0048878\n \n, \n \n2004/0058934\n \n, \n \n2005/0070527\n \n, \n \n2005/0070550\n \n, \n \n2005/0261309 \n \n \n \n2008/0269239\n \n, \n \n2008/02611946\n \n, \n \n20080188452\n \n, and International Patent Application Nos \n \nW002/072548\n \n, \n \nWO2004022060\n \n, \n \nWO2005054239\n \n, \n \nWO2005014556\n \n, \n \nWO 2005089748\n \n, \n \nWO2007/120690\n \n, \n \nWO2008100565\n \n and \n \nWO2008003702\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther exemplary Histamine H4 antagonists that are contemplated by the invention include but are not limited to those described in Jablonowski JA et al.

This affinity is 540-fold more selective over the H3 receptor (Ki = 14.1 µM) (Zhang M. et al. 2007).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment, the Histamine H4 receptor antagonist is 1-[(5-chloro-1H-indol-2-yl)carbonyl]-4-methylpiperazine (also named JNJ 7777120) described by Robin L. et al. (2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment, the Histamine H4 receptor antagonist is 4-((3R)-3-Aminopyrrolidin-1-yl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-benzo[6,7]cyclohepta[1,2-d]pyrimidin-2-ylamine (also named A-943931) described by Cowart MD. et al. (2008).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment, the Histamine H4 receptor antagonist is cis-4-(Piperazin-1-yl)-5,6,7a,8,9,10,11,11a-octahydrobenzofuro[2,3- h]quinazolin-2-amine (also named A-987306) described by Liu H et al. (2008).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the Histamine H4 receptor antagonist may consist in an antibody (the term including antibody fragment) that can block Histamine H4 receptor activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the Histamine H4 receptor antagonist may consist in an antibody directed against the Histamine H4 receptor or a ligand of the Histamine H4 receptor, in such a way that said antibody impairs the binding of a H4 ligand to said receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies directed against the Histamine H4 receptor can be raised according to known methods by administering the appropriate antigen or epitope to a host animal selected, e.g., from pigs, cows, horses, rabbits, goats, sheep, and mice, among others. Various adjuvants known in the art can be used to enhance antibody production. Although antibodies useful in practicing the invention can be polyclonal, monoclonal antibodies are preferred. Monoclonal antibodies against Histamine H4 receptor or ligands of Histamine H4 receptors can be prepared and isolated using any technique that provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. Techniques for production and isolation include but are not limited to the hybridoma technique originally described by Kohler and Milstein (1975); the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Cote et al., 1983); and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al. 1985). Alternatively, techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778\n \n) can be adapted to produce anti-H4, or anti-H4 ligands single chain antibodies. Histamine H4 receptor antagonists useful in practicing the present invention also include anti-H4, or anti-H4 ligands antibody fragments including but not limited to F(ab')\n2\n fragments, which can be generated by pepsin digestion of an intact antibody molecule, and Fab fragments, which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab')\n2\n fragments. Alternatively, Fab and/or scFv expression libraries can be constructed to allow rapid identification of fragments having the desired specificity to Histamine H4 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHumanized anti-Histamine H4 receptor or anti-H4 ligands antibodies and antibody fragments therefrom can also be prepared according to known techniques. \"Humanized antibodies\" are forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region (CDRs) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Methods for making humanized antibodies are described, for example, by \n \nWinter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539\n \n) and \n \nBoss (Celltech, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThen after raising antibodies directed against the Histamine H4 receptor as above described, the skilled man in the art can easily select those blocking Histamine H4 receptor activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the Histamine H4 receptor antagonist is an aptamer. Aptamers are a class of molecule that represents an alternative to antibodies in term of molecular recognition. Aptamers are oligonucleotide or oligopeptide sequences with the capacity to recognize virtually any class of target molecules with high affinity and specificity. Such ligands may be isolated through Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) of a random sequence library, as described in Tuerk C. and Gold L., 1990. The random sequence library is obtainable by combinatorial chemical synthesis of DNA. In this library, each member is a linear oligomer, eventually chemically modified, of a unique sequence. Possible modifications, uses and advantages of this class of molecules have been reviewed in Jayasena S.D., 1999. Peptide aptamers consists of a conformationally constrained antibody variable region displayed by a platform protein, such as E. coli Thioredoxin A that are selected from combinatorial libraries by two hybrid methods (Colas et al., 1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThen after raising aptamers directed against the Histamine H4 receptor as above described, the skilled man in the art can easily select those blocking Histamine H4 receptor activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention relates to the use of an inhibitor of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHistamine receptor (H1, H2, H3 or H4) sequences showing low sequence identity, the inhibitors of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression which may be used according to the invention advantageously provides selective inhibition of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression, by comparison with the other histamine receptors (H1, H2, or H3) expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibitors of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression for use in the present invention may be based on anti-sense oligonucleotide constructs. Anti-sense oligonucleotides, including anti-sense RNA molecules and anti-sense DNA molecules, would act to directly block the translation of Histamine H4 receptor mRNA by binding thereto and thus preventing protein translation or increasing mRNA degradation, thus decreasing the level of Histamine H4 receptors, and thus activity, in a cell. For example, antisense oligonucleotides of at least about 15 bases and complementary to unique regions of the mRNA transcript sequence encoding Histamine H4 receptor can be synthesized, e.g., by conventional phosphodiester techniques and administered by e.g., intravenous injection or infusion. Methods for using antisense techniques for specifically inhibiting gene expression of genes whose sequence is known are well known in the art (e.g. see \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 6,566,135\n \n; \n \n6,566,131\n \n; \n \n6,365,354\n \n; \n \n6,410,323\n \n; \n \n6,107,091\n \n; \n \n6,046,321\n \n; and \n \n5,981,732\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSmall inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) can also function as inhibitors of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression for use in the present invention. Histamine H4 receptor gene expression can be reduced by contacting a subject or cell with a small double stranded RNA (dsRNA), or a vector or construct causing the production of a small double stranded RNA, such that Histamine H4 receptor gene expression is specifically inhibited (i.e. RNA interference or RNAi). Methods for selecting an appropriate dsRNA or dsRNA-encoding vector are well known in the art for genes whose sequence is known (e.g. see Tuschl, T. et al. (1999); Elbashir, S. M. et al. (2001); Hannon, GJ. (2002); McManus, MT. et al. (2002); Brummelkamp, TR. et al. (2002); \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 6,573,099\n \n and \n \n6,506,559\n \n; and International Patent Publication Nos. \n \nWO 01/36646\n \n, \n \nWO 99/32619\n \n, and \n \nWO 01/68836\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRibozymes can also function as inhibitors of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression for use in the present invention. Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the specific cleavage of RNA. The mechanism of ribozyme action involves sequence specific hybridization of the ribozyme molecule to complementary target RNA, followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. Engineered hairpin or hammerhead motif ribozyme molecules that specifically and efficiently catalyze endonucleolytic cleavage of Histamine H4 receptor mRNA sequences are thereby useful within the scope of the present invention. Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within any potential RNA target are initially identified by scanning the target molecule for ribozyme cleavage sites, which typically include the following sequences, GUA, GUU, and GUC. Once identified, short RNA sequences of between about 15 and 20 ribonucleotides corresponding to the region of the target gene containing the cleavage site can be evaluated for predicted structural features, such as secondary structure, that can render the oligonucleotide sequence unsuitable. The suitability of candidate targets can also be evaluated by testing their accessibility to hybridization with complementary oligonucleotides, using, e.g., ribonuclease protection assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes useful as inhibitors of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression can be prepared by known methods. These include techniques for chemical synthesis such as, e.g., by solid phase phosphoramadite chemical synthesis. Alternatively, anti-sense RNA molecules can be generated by in vitro or in vivo transcription of DNA sequences encoding the RNA molecule. Such DNA sequences can be incorporated into a wide variety of vectors that incorporate suitable RNA polymerase promoters such as the T7 or SP6 polymerase promoters. Various modifications to the oligonucleotides of the invention can be introduced as a means of increasing intracellular stability and half-life. Possible modifications include but are not limited to the addition of flanking sequences of ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides to the 5' and/or 3' ends of the molecule, or the use of phosphorothioate or 2'-O-methyl rather than phosphodiesterase linkages within the oligonucleotide backbone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntisense oligonucleotides siRNAs and ribozymes of the invention may be delivered in vivo alone or in association with a vector. In its broadest sense, a \"vector\" is any vehicle capable of facilitating the transfer of the antisense oligonucleotide siRNA or ribozyme nucleic acid to the cells and preferably cells expressing Histamine H4 receptor. Preferably, the vector transports the nucleic acid to cells with reduced degradation relative to the extent of degradation that would result in the absence of the vector. In general, the vectors useful in the invention include, but are not limited to, plasmids, phagemids, viruses, other vehicles derived from viral or bacterial sources that have been manipulated by the insertion or incorporation of the the antisense oligonucleotide siRNA or ribozyme nucleic acid sequences. Viral vectors are a preferred type of vector and include, but are not limited to nucleic acid sequences from the following viruses: retrovirus, such as moloney murine leukemia virus, harvey murine sarcoma virus, murine mammary tumor virus, and rouse sarcoma virus; adenovirus, adeno-associated virus; SV40-type viruses; polyoma viruses; Epstein-Barr viruses; papilloma viruses; herpes virus; vaccinia virus; polio virus; and RNA virus such as a retrovirus. One can readily employ other vectors not named but known to the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred viral vectors are based on non-cytopathic eukaryotic viruses in which non-essential genes have been replaced with the gene of interest. Non-cytopathic viruses include retroviruses (e.g., lentivirus), the life cycle of which involves reverse transcription of genomic viral RNA into DNA with subsequent proviral integration into host cellular DNA. Retroviruses have been approved for human gene therapy trials. Most useful are those retroviruses that are replication-deficient (i.e., capable of directing synthesis of the desired proteins, but incapable of manufacturing an infectious particle). Such genetically altered retroviral expression vectors have general utility for the high-efficiency transduction of genes in vivo. Standard protocols for producing replication-deficient retroviruses (including the steps of incorporation of exogenous genetic material into a plasmid, transfection of a packaging cell lined with plasmid, production of recombinant retroviruses by the packaging cell line, collection of viral particles from tissue culture media, and infection of the target cells with viral particles) are provided in Kriegler, 1990 and in Murry, 1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred viruses for certain applications are the adeno-viruses and adeno-associated viruses, which are double-stranded DNA viruses that have already been approved for human use in gene therapy. The adeno-associated virus can be engineered to be replication deficient and is capable of infecting a wide range of cell types and species. It further has advantages such as, heat and lipid solvent stability; high transduction frequencies in cells of diverse lineages, including hemopoietic cells; and lack of superinfection inhibition thus allowing multiple series of transductions. Reportedly, the adeno-associated virus can integrate into human cellular DNA in a site-specific manner, thereby minimizing the possibility of insertional mutagenesis and variability of inserted gene expression characteristic of retroviral infection. In addition, wild-type adeno-associated virus infections have been followed in tissue culture for greater than 100 passages in the absence of selective pressure, implying that the adeno-associated virus genomic integration is a relatively stable event. The adeno-associated virus can also function in an extrachromosomal fashion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther vectors include plasmid vectors. Plasmid vectors have been extensively described in the art and are well known to those of skill in the art. See e.g. Sambrook et al., 1989. In the last few years, plasmid vectors have been used as DNA vaccines for delivering antigen-encoding genes to cells in vivo. They are particularly advantageous for this because they do not have the same safety concerns as with many of the viral vectors. These plasmids, however, having a promoter compatible with the host cell, can express a peptide from a gene operatively encoded within the plasmid. Some commonly used plasmids include pBR322, pUC18, pUCl9, pRC/CMV, SV40, and pBlueScript. Other plasmids are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, plasmids may be custom designed using restriction enzymes and ligation reactions to remove and add specific fragments of DNA. Plasmids may be delivered by a variety of parenteral, mucosal and topical routes. For example, the DNA plasmid can be injected by intramuscular, intradermal, subcutaneous, or other routes. It may also be administered by intranasal sprays or drops, rectal suppository and orally. It may also be administered into the epidermis or a mucosal surface using a gene-gun. The plasmids may be given in an aqueous solution, dried onto gold particles or in association with another DNA delivery system including but not limited to liposomes, dendrimers, cochleate and microencapsulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother object of the invention relates to a method for treating and/or preventing a vestibular disorder comprising administering a subject in need thereof with a Histamine H4 receptor antagonist or an inhibitor of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHistamine H4 receptor antagonists or inhibitors of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, as defined below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, said antagonist or inhibitor is administered in a therapeutically effective amount.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy a \"therapeutically effective amount\" is meant a sufficient amount of the Histamine H4 receptor antagonist or inhibitor of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression to treat and/or to prevent vestibular disorders at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidential with the specific polypeptide employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. However, the daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from 0.01 to 1,000 mg per adult per day. Preferably, the compositions contain 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100, 250 and 500 mg of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. A medicament typically contains from about 0.01 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient, preferably from 1 mg to about 100 mg of the active ingredient. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level from 0.0002 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg of body weight per day, especially from about 0.001 mg/kg to 7 mg/kg of body weight per day.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreening methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibitors of the invention can be further identified by screening methods described in the state of the art. The screening methods of the invention can be carried out according to known methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe screening method may measure the binding of a candidate compound to the receptor, or to cells or membranes bearing the receptor, or a fusion protein thereof by means of a label directly or indirectly associated with the candidate compound. Alternatively, a screening method may involve measuring or, qualitatively or quantitatively, detecting the competition of binding of a candidate compound to the receptor with a labelled competitor (e.g., antagonist or agonist). Further, screening methods may test whether the candidate compound results in a signal generated by an antagonist of the receptor, using detection systems appropriate to cells bearing the receptor. Antagonists can be assayed in the presence of a known agonist (e.g. Histamine) and an effect on activation by the agonist by the presence of the candidate compound is observed. Competitive binding using known agonist such as histamine is also suitable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antagonistic activity of the candidate compounds towards the Histamine H4 receptor may be for example determined using various models. For example, methods that are described in Thurmond RL et al. (2004) or Venable JD. et al. (2005) may be used.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Histamine H4 receptor antagonist or inhibitor of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, and optionally sustained-release matrices, such as biodegradable polymers, to form therapeutic compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, the active principle, alone or in combination with another active principle, can be administered in a unit administration form, as a mixture with conventional pharmaceutical supports, to animals and human beings. Suitable unit administration forms comprise oral-route forms such as tablets, gel capsules, powders, granules and oral suspensions or solutions, sublingual and buccal administration forms, aerosols, implants, subcutaneous, transdermal, topical, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intravenous, subdermal, transdermal, intrathecal and intranasal administration forms and rectal administration forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the pharmaceutical compositions contain vehicles which are pharmaceutically acceptable for a formulation capable of being injected. These may be in particular isotonic, sterile, saline solutions (monosodium or disodium phosphate, sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium chloride and the like or mixtures of such salts), or dry, especially freeze-dried compositions which upon addition, depending on the case, of sterilized water or physiological saline, permit the constitution of injectable solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions; formulations including sesame oil, peanut oil or aqueous propylene glycol; and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolutions comprising compounds of the invention as free base or pharmacologically acceptable salts can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant, such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Histamine H4 receptor antagonist or inhibitor of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression of the invention can be formulated into a composition in a neutral or salt form. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the protein) and which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric, mandelic, and the like. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, histidine, procaine and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe carrier can also be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetables oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminium monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active polypeptides in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon formulation, solutions will be administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation and in such amount as is therapeutically effective. The formulations are easily administered in a variety of dosage forms, such as the type of injectable solutions described above, but drug release capsules and the like can also be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor parenteral administration in an aqueous solution, for example, the solution should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. In this connection, sterile aqueous media which can be employed will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. For example, one dosage could be dissolved in 1 ml of isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the proposed site of infusion. Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated. The person responsible for administration will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Histamine H4 receptor antagonist or inhibitor of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression of the invention may be formulated within a therapeutic mixture to comprise about 0.0001 to 1.0 milligrams, or about 0.001 to 0.1 milligrams, or about 0.1 to 1.0 or even about 10 milligrams per dose or so. Multiple doses can also be administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the compounds of the invention formulated for parenteral administration, such as intravenous or intramuscular injection, other pharmaceutically acceptable forms include, e.g. tablets or other solids for oral administration; liposomal formulations ; time release capsules ; and any other form currently used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment, the Histamine H4 receptor antagonist or inhibitor of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression is administered directly in the inner ear through the tympanic membrane. This administration mode may be preferred for introducing a direct and long term effect on the vestibule. Accordingly in a preferred embodiment, the Histamine H4 receptor antagonist or inhibitor of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression is administered in a gel formulation to allow a long term release of said antagonist or inhibitor in the inner ear.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention will further be illustrated in view of the following figures and examples.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFIGURES:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \nFigure 1\n \n \n.\n Effect of VUF 6002 on the depolarization-induced firing volley.

These responses were reversible during rinse with control medium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrugs/Chemicals:\n The 1-[(5-Chloro-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl) carbonyl]-4-methyl piperazine maleate (JNJ 10191584 maleate or VUF 6002) was purchase from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). Stock solution was prepared at 50 mM in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide as recommended by the supplier. Stock solution of betahistine dihydrochloride (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St-Quentin Fallavier, France) was prepared in recording medium at 1 M. Drugs were then diluted in working solution before use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCell culture\n: Vestibular ganglion neurons were explanted aseptically from 2 to 6 days-old Wistar rats (Centre d'Elevage Janvier, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France). All procedures were carried out in accordance to the French/European Communities Council Directive 86/609/EEC. The brainstem was hemi-sectioned and the eighth nerve was followed up to the level of the otocyst and cut just rostral to it.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe vestibular ganglia were excised, placed in Leibovitz medium (L15, Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France), and dissociated by enzymatically (collagenase 0.75 mg/ml, dispase 1 mg/ml and dnase 0.75 mg/ml, 15 min at 25° C). Enzymes were washed with Tyrode solution without Ca\n2+\n and Mg\n2+\n, and the ganglion neurons were gently dissociated in culture medium with a pipette. The neurons were plated onto culture dishes previously coated with 5 µg/ml poly-L-ornithine, 10 µg/ml laminin and subsequently filled with 0.5 ml of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified eagle medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 % N\n2\n nutrient glucose (5 g/l), glutamine (1.5 mM), sodium bicarbonate (1.1 g/I), HEPES buffer (15 mM, pH 7.4), AraC 2 µM, brain-derived neurotrophic \nfactor\n 10 µg/ml and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin. The low density cultures were then maintained at 37°C in 5 % CO\n2\n for 7 to 8 days prior patch-clamp experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPatch-clamp recordings :\n Whole-cell (current-clamp configuration) recording of responses were obtained using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments; Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The extracellular solution contained (in mM): NaCl 135, \nHEPES\n 10, \nglucose\n 10, \nMgCl\n \n \n \n2\n 1, \nKCl\n 5, and CaCl\n2\n 4, pH 7.35 (with NaOH). Recording pipettes (2-3 MΩ) were drawn from microhematocrit tubes (Modulohm I/S, Herlev, Denmark) and filled with the following solution (in mM): KCl 135, \nHEPES\n 10, \nglucose\n 10, \nNaCl\n 5, \nEGTA\n 5, Mg-ATP 3, GTP-\nNa\n 1, pH 7.35 (with KOH). The osmolarity of all solutions was set to 300 mOsm/l\n-1\n. Experimental parameters and data acquisition were controlled with a PC computer and a Tecmar Labmaster analogue interface (Axon instruments, CA). Voltage transients were recorded from neurons presenting resting potentials lying between -45 and -65 mV. Trains of action potentials (APs) were elicited using 1 s, 200 pA depolarizing pulses applied every 6.5s. Current signals were filtered at 10 KHz, digitized and stored using pCLAMP software (v 10.2, Axon instruments).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nDrug application :\n The control and test solutions were applied using a multiple capillary perfusion system (flow rate 500 µl/min). After each application of the tested drug, the cells were washed with control buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nData analysis and statistical methods\n : The results are expressed as means ± S.E.M. The number of sample size (n) given is the number of neurons tested. Variations of the membrane potential and the number of APs were analysed using pCLAMP software (v10.2, Axon instruments). Drug concentration-effect relationships were fitted with a Hill equation of the form I(x) = A*xn/(IC\n50\nn+xn).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nResults :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nUnder phase contrast microscopy, cultured vestibular ganglion neurons had refringent soma with diameters ranging between 10 and 25 µm. All recorded neurons had long neuritic processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecorded neurons displayed a resting potential of -50.2 ± 3.7 mV (n = 43, range - 45 to -65 mV). Upon application of depolarizing pulses (1s, 200 pA) two types of APs discharging volley were recorded. Phasic discharges constituted of 1 to 4 AP, while tonic discharges exhibited 10 to 80 APs (mean 34.2 ± 15.6, n=43), (\nfig 1A-C\n a). Unless inhibitors application, these discharging patterns could be stable up to 30 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the discharge pattern was phasic, application of 100 µM VUF 6002 completely abolished the firing (n = 3). In neurons exhibiting tonic responses, application of VUF 6002 reduced the number of depolarization elicited APs in dose-dependant way. \nFigure 1\n illustrates the inhibitions of the discharge. At 100 µM the inhibition was 91% (\nFig. 1A\n), while the compound induced only a slight membrane hyperpolarization (about -3 mV) on the neurons. After washing, neurons recovered partially their initial firings (\nFig. 1A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApplication of 10 µm, 1 µM and 100 nM of VUF 6002 inhibited the firing by 69%, 34% and 22% respectively. These inhibitory effects were totally reversed by subsequent perfusion of control medium demonstrating the reversibility of the response (\nFig. 1B-C\n). Action potentials intrinsic properties such as spike amplitude, time to peak, rise and decay time constants appeared to be not affected by VUF 6002.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose-response inhibition relationship of VUF 6002 was constructed with concentrations between 0.01 µM and 100 µM (\nFig. 2\n). In our recording conditions, maximum inhibition occurred around 100 µM (90% inhibition) and the dose-response relationship had an IC50 of 3.5 µM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy comparison, responses were established for BH applications. BH inhibited the discharge volley in the same way. Maximum inhibition of the discharge volley, elicited during standard depolarization stimulation, by BH was around 10 mM. During 2 mM application the membrane potential was not affected, but treatment by BH at 5 mM induced a strong transitory depolarization of the neurons (14.3 ± 4.7 mV, n= 16) (\nFig. 3\n). The firing inhibition was rapidly abolished by subsequent perfusion of control medium indicating the reversibility of the response (\nFig.3\n). The dose-response relationship presented an IC50 of 2.2 mM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPresent results are the first demonstration that Histamine H4 receptor antagonists are potent inhibitors of the mammal vestibular primary neurons firing.\n\n \n \n \nHistamine H4 receptor antagonists inhibited reversibly on a dose-dependant manner the firing of vestibular neurons.\n \nHistamine H4 receptor antagonists are more efficient than classical antivertiginous prescribed drugs (e.g. VUF 6002 is 600 more efficient than betahistidine).\n \nThe pharmacological properties of Histamine H4 receptor antagonists designs it as a powerful vestibuloplegic drug that could bring a therapeutic gain in the treatment of vestibular disorders.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAccordingly, selective inhibitors of Histamine H4 receptor gene expression and/or activity may be useful for the treatment of vestibular disorders.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThroughout this application, various references describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.

Description\n\n\nTranslated from \nFrench\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa présente invention concerne de nouveaux conjugués dipeptidiques antagonistes de l'alpha-MSH et leur utilisation en tant que médicament ou en tant que dépigmentant.\nThe present invention relates to novel dipeptide antagonists of alpha-MSH and their use as a medicament or depigmenting agent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLes récepteurs de la mélanocortine appartiennent à la superfamille de sept récepteurs transmembranaires couplés à la protéine G et ils stimulent la voie de la transduction du signal de l'AMPc (\n \nCone et al. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996, 51, pages 287-317\n \n). Le système de la mélanocortine est impliqué dans de multiples voies physiologiques y compris la pigmentation, l'inflammation, la fonction érectile, le comportement alimentaire, l'homéostasie énergétique, l'homéostasie pondérale et la fonction des glandes exocrines. Les ligands des agonistes endogènes pour ces récepteurs de la mélanocortine sont dérivés par modification post-traductionnelle du transcrit du gène de la proopiomélanocortine, qui lors du traitement différentiel entraîne la génération des hormones α, β et y stimulant les mélanocytes (MSH) et de la corticotrophine (ACTH). Les sous-types des récepteurs de la mélanocortine sont activés par tous les peptides de la mélanocortine endogène, à l'exception du récepteur de la mélanocortine MC\n2\n qui est uniquement stimulé par la corticotrophine. La famille des récepteurs de la mélanocortine a aussi deux antagonistes endogènes, l'agouti et la protéine apparentée à l'agouti (AGRP) (\n \nLu et al. Nature 1994, 371, pages 799-802\n \n, \n \nOllmann et al., Science 1997, pages 135-138\n \n, \n \nShulter et al., Genes Dev. 1997, 11, pages 593-602\n \n) qui sont les seuls antagonistes connus existant à l'état naturel de ces récepteurs couplés à la protéine G découverts à ce jour. Ce sont des polypeptides de, respectivement, 132 et 49 résidus d'acides aminés. Les ligands des récepteurs de la mélanocortine les mieux étudiés sont ceux des récepteurs MC\n1\n de la mélanocortine de la peau qui sont impliqués dans la pigmentation et la coloration du pelage des animaux (\n \nHruby et al. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1993, 680, pages 51-63\n \n ; \n \nLerner et al. Nature 1961, pages 189, 176\n \n ; \n \nMountjoy, et al. Science 1992, 257, pages 1248-1251\n \n).\n\nLe nonapeptide \n153 N-6\n (\n \nJayawickreme et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1994, 269, pages 29846-29854\n \n) (H-Met-Pro-D-Phe-Arg-d-Trp-Phe-Lys-Pro-Val-NH\n2\n: Ki = 11 nM) est un antagoniste de synthèse du récepteur MC\n1\n. Toutefois, ce composé est de haut poids moléculaire et possède donc une activité thérapeutique ou cosmétique très limitée. En effet, sa taille le rend difficile à optimiser et sa biodisponibilité est limitée. De plus, il est cher et difficile à préparer.\n\nLe tripeptide D-Trp-Arg-Leu-NH\n2\n (\n \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (1995), 92, pages 2894 - 2898\n \n) a également une activité antagoniste. Toutefois, il contient le tryptophan qui est un acide aminé instable et peut donc poser des problèmes de stabilité au stockage.\nThe melanocortin receptors belong to the superfamily of seven G-protein-coupled transmembrane receptors and they stimulate the cAMP signal transduction pathway ( \n \n Cone et al. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996, 51, pages 287-317 \n \n ). The melanocortin system is involved in multiple physiological pathways including pigmentation, inflammation, erectile function, eating behavior, energy homeostasis, weight homeostasis, and exocrine gland function. The ligands of the endogenous agonists for these melanocortin receptors are derived by post-translational modification of the transcript of the proopiomelanocortin gene, which during the differential treatment results in the generation of the α, β and γ-stimulating hormones melanocytes (MSH) and the corticotrophin (ACTH). The melanocortin receptor subtypes are activated by all peptides of endogenous melanocortin, with the exception of the melanocortin MC \n2\n receptor which is only stimulated by corticotrophin. The family of melanocortin receptors also has two  endogenous antagonists, agouti and agouti-related protein (AGRP) ( \n \n Lu et al. Nature 1994, 371, pages 799-802 \n \n , \n \n Ollmann et al., Science 1997, pages 135-138 \n \n , \n \n Shulter et al., Gen. Dev. 1997, 11, pp. 593-602 \n \n ) which are the only known naturally occurring antagonists of these G protein-coupled receptors discovered to date. These are polypeptides of, respectively, 132 and 49 amino acid residues. The most well-studied melanocortin receptor ligands are those of skin melanocortin MC \n1\n receptors that are involved in the pigmentation and coloration of animal fur ( \n \n Hruby et al. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 1993, 680, pages 51-63 \n \n ; \n \n Lerner et al. Nature 1961, pages 189, 176 \n \n ; \n \n Mountjoy, et al. Science 1992, 257, pp. 1248-1251 \n \n ). \n The nonapeptide \n153 N-6\n ( \n \n Jayawickreme et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1994, 269, pp. 29846-29854 \n \n ) (H-Met-Pro-D-Phe-Arg-D-Trp-Phe-Lys-Pro-Val-NH \n2:\n Ki = 11 nM) is an antagonist of receptor synthesis MC \n1.\n However, this compound is of high molecular weight and therefore has a very limited therapeutic or cosmetic activity. Indeed, its size makes it difficult to optimize and its bioavailability is limited. In addition, it is expensive and difficult to prepare. \n The tripeptide D-Trp-Arg-Leu-NH \n2\n ( \n \n Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (1995), 92, pages 2894-2888 \n \n ) also has antagonistic activity. However, it contains tryptophan which is an unstable amino acid and may therefore pose storage stability problems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEP 1 174 437\n \n décrit des di ou tripeptides comportant un groupe naphtyle et en particulier un groupe naphtylalanyle. Toutefois, la présence du groupe naphtyle augmente le prix de fabrication du produit. Par ailleurs, dans certains pays comme le Japon, les peptides à base d'acide aminé non naturel ne peuvent être vendus pour des applications cosmétiques. En outre aucune activité de dipeptides n'est indiquée.\n \n \n EP 1 174 437 \n \n discloses di or tripeptides having a naphthyl group and in particular a naphthylalanyl group. However, the presence of the naphthyl group increases the manufacturing cost of the product. On the other hand, in some countries, such as Japan, non-natural amino acid-based peptides can not be sold for cosmetic applications. In addition, no dipeptide activity is indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLes inventeurs ont découvert de façon surprenante que des dipeptides conjugués au niveau du C-terminal avec des acides carboxyliques ont une activité antagoniste de l'alpha MSH. Ces antagonistes ont un très faible poids moléculaire, sont donc faciles à optimiser, ont une bonne biodisponibilité et sont très faciles à préparer.\nThe inventors have surprisingly discovered that C-terminal conjugated dipeptides with carboxylic acids have alpha MSH antagonistic activity.

Ces conjugués dipeptidiques présentent une CI\n50\n dans une plage micromolaire. Ces dipeptides sont le premier exemple de composés antagonistes de synthèse courts se liant au récepteur MC\n1\n et ils ouvrent le champ des antagonistes à petite molécule non peptidique de l'α-MSH.\n\nEn particulier ces composés comprennent un résidu arginine en position AA2. De manière intéressante, le composé 125 (Palm-Ser-Pro-NH\n2\n), n'ayant aucun résidu basique dans sa séquence, a montré une valeur de CI\n50\n de 17 µM. Ce résultat a montré que la liaison sur le récepteur MC\n1\n ne nécessite pas obligatoirement un radical chargé positivement.\n\nAvec seulement deux résidus d'acides aminés, ces composés palmitoylés peuvent être considérés comme des composés chefs de file utiles pour la conception d'antagonistes non peptidiques de l'α-MSH.\nThus, unexpectedly, the Palm dipeptides tested appeared to be antagonists of the melanocortin MC \n1\n receptor using human cell lines  M4Be melanoma cells. These dipeptide conjugates have an IC \n50\n in micromolar range. These dipeptides are the first example of short synthesis antagonist compounds that bind to the MC \n1\n receptor and open up the field of non-peptide small molecule antagonists of α-MSH. \n In particular, these compounds comprise an arginine residue at position AA2. Interestingly, compound 125 (Palm-Ser-Pro-NH \n2\n ), having no basic residue in its sequence, showed an IC \n50\n value of 17 μM. This result showed that the binding on the MC \n1\n receptor does not necessarily require a positively charged radical. \n With only two amino acid residues, these palmitoyl compounds can be considered as useful lead compounds for the design of non-peptide α-MSH antagonists."

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, wherein loss of memory and other intellectual abilities are serious enough to interfere with daily living. Alzheimer's disease is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of memory accompanied with cholinergic neurodegeneration (Kar, S.; Quirion, R. Amyloid β peptides and central cholinergic neurons: functional interrelationship and relevance to Alzheimer's disease pathology. \nProg. Brain Res. \n2004, 145 (Acetylcholine in the Cerebral Cortex), 261-274.). This disease accounts for over 50% of all progressive cognitive impairment in elderly patients. The prevalence increases with age. Alzheimer's disease is classified by its severity as mild, moderate and severe. The pathological hallmarks of AD include neuronal dysfunction/death, accumulation of senile plaques extracellularly and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) intraneuronally. Several hypotheses have been put forth to explain the pathophysiology of this disease, including aberrant β-amyloid (Aβ) metabolism, hyperphosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins, genetic predisposition such as mutations in genes coding for presenilin-1 and -2 (PS-1 and PS-2) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), apolipoprotein E genotype, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, inflammation and abnormal cell cycle re-entry. However to date, none of these hypotheses is sufficient to explain the diversity of biochemical and pathological abnormalities in AD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo pathological hallmarks of AD are generally recognized: senile plaques composed of (β-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Aβ\n1-42\n) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by abnormal polymerization of microtubule-associated protein tau (Walsh, D. M.; Selkoe, D. J. Deciphering the molecular basis of memory failure in Alzheimer's disease. \nNeuron \n2004, 44(1), 181-193.). While the precise cause underlying AD-related memory loss and cognitive changes remains to be fully elucidated, there is evidence indicating that pathological assemblies of Aβ\n1-42 \ncause diverse forms of AD and that tau plays a role including in mechanisms leading to Aβ\n1-42\n-induced neurodegeneration. More recent evidence from studies using transgenic animals suggests that tau pathology exacerbates neurodegenerative and cognitive processes in the presence of Aβ\n1-42 \n(Oddo, S.; Caccamo, A.; et al. Temporal Profile of Amyloid-β (Aβ) Oligomerization in an in Vivo Model of Alzheimer Disease: a link between Aβ and tau pathology. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n2006, 281(3), 1599-1604.). In addition to Aβ and tau, dysregulation of calcium homeostasis also plays an integral role in the pathophysiology of AD (Green, K. N.; LaFerla, F. M. Linking calcium to Aβ and Alzheimer's disease. \nNeuron \n2008, 59(2), 190-194.). It is becoming evident that dysregulation of mitochondrial function and resultant altered cellular homeostasis increasingly contributes to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD (Moreira, P. I.; Santos, M. S.; et al. Is mitochondrial impairment a common link between Alzheimer's disease and diabetes? A matter under discussion. \nTrends Alzheimer's Dis. Res. \n2006, 259-279. Beal, M. F. Mitochondria and neurodegeneration. Novartis Found. Symp. 2007, 287 (Mitochondrial Biology), 183-196. Reddy, P. H.; Beal, M. F. Amyloid beta, mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic damage: implications for cognitive decline in aging and Alzheimer's disease. \nTrends Mol. Med. \n2008, 14(2), 45-53.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMitochondria play major roles in bioenergetics and cell death/survival signaling of the mammalian cell as they are ‘gatekeepers of life and death’. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases with pathophysiological consequences at multiple levels including at the level of calcium-driven excitotoxicity. One of the primary mitochondrial mechanisms is the mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTP) that represent a multiprotein complex derived from components of inner and outer mitochondrial membrane. The pores regulate transport of ions and peptides in and out of mitochondria, and their regulation is associated with mechanisms for maintaining cellular calcium homeostasis. A deficit in mitochondria is the earliest feature of neurodegenerative diseases. One general characteristic of aging and neurodegeneration is an increase in the number of neuronal cells undergoing signs of apoptotic degeneration. A key role for this apoptotic process is attributable to the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which provides transport in and out of mitochondria for both calcium ions and compounds with low molecular weight. It has been proposed that MPTP is a multiprotein complex with the outer membrane fragment including porin (a voltage-dependent ion channel), anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bc1-2 family, and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. The inner fragment of MPTP contains an adenine nucleotide translocator and cyclophilin, which may interact with proapoptotic proteins of the Bax family Inhibition of mitochondrial calcium uptake and/or blocking of MPTP may protect cells against the development of apoptosis in the presence of pathological factors such as excitotoxins and anti-oxidants. Indirect modulation of MPTP via kinase pathways is also known wherein glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) mediates convergence of protection signaling to inhibit the mitochondrial MPTP (Juhaszova, M.; Zorov, D. B.; et al. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β mediates convergence of protection signaling to inhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n2004, 113(11), 1535-1549. Juhaszova, M.; Wang, S.; et al. The identity and regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore: where the known meets the unknown. \nAnn. N. Y. Acad. Sci. \n2008, 1123 (Control and Regulation of Transport Phenomena in the Cardiac System), 197-212.) and mitochondrial localization during apoptosis (Linseman, D. A.; Butts, B. D.; et al. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphorylates Bax and promotes its mitochondrial localization during neuronal apoptosis. \nJ. Neurosci. \n2004, 24(44), 9993-10002.). Furthermore, calcium-dependent activation of MPTP in brain mitochondria enhances with age and may play an important role in age related neurodegenerative disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeuroprotective effects of agents have been linked to various cellular processes including inhibition of mitochondrial MPTPs. For example, the neuroprotective effects of 4-azasteroids parallel the inhibition of the mitochondrial transition pore (Soskic, V.; Klemm, M.; et al. A connection between the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, autophagy, and cerebral amyloidogenesis. J. \nProteome Res. \n2008, 7(6): 2262-2269.). In vivo administration of MPTP inhibitor, 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-phenyl-pyrrole-2,5-dione to a mouse model of multiple sclerosis significantly prevented the development of the disease (Pelicci, P., Giorgio, M.; et al. MPTP inhibitors for blockade of degenerative tissue damages. WO 2008067863A2). Compounds such as dimebolin (latrepirdine, 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2,8-dimethyl-5-[2-(6-methyl-3-pyridinyl)ethyl]-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole) have been shown to improve neuronal function and a role for improved neuronal outgrowth and mitochondrial function has been suggested. Dimebolin has been shown to inhibit neuronal death in models of AD and Huntington's disease, another neurodegenerative disease (Lermontova, N. N.;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLukoyanov, N. V.; et al. Dimebone improves learning in animals with experimental Alzheimer's disease. \nBull. Exp. Biol. Med. \n2000, 129(6), 544-546. Bachurin, S.; Bukatina, E.; et al. Antihistamine agent dimebon as a novel neuroprotector and a cognition enhancer. \nAnn. N. Y. Acad. Sci. \n2001, 939 (Neuroprotective Agents), 425-435.). More recently, dimebolin has been shown to possess a clinically beneficial effect in cognition in patients with AD (Burns, A.; Jacoby, R. Dimebon in Alzheimer's disease: old drug for new indication. \nLancet \n2008, 372(9634), 179-80. Doody, R. S.; Gavrilova, S. I.; et al. Effect of dimebon on cognition, activities of daily living, behaviour, and global function in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. \nLancet \n2008, 372(9634), 207-215.). Patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease administered with 20 mg three times a day (60 mg/day) showed significant improvement in the clinical course of disease, as reflected in improvement over baseline for ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer's disease assessment scale—cognitive subscale). In particular, dimebolin-treated patients demonstrated a significant improvement over placebo in cognition, global function, activities of daily living and behavior. A six-month open-label extension trial of dimebolin produced results similar to those in the preceding 12-month clinical trial (Cummings, J.; Doody, R.; Gavrilova, S.; Sano, M.; Aisen, P.; Seely, L.; Hung, D. 18-month data from an open-label extension of a one-year controlled trial of dimebon in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Presented at the International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (ICAD), Chicago, Ill., USA, July 2008; paper P4-334.). Patients with mild-to-moderate AD who had earlier received the drug for 12 months had preservation of function close to their starting baseline on key symptoms of AD. Patients originally on placebo who received dimebolin in the extension study showed stabilization across all key measures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDimebolin has been approved in Russia as a non-selective antihistamine. The drug was sold for many years before selective anti-histaminergic agents were developed. Although dimebolin was initially thought to exert its cognitive enhancing effects through inhibition of butyryl-cholinesterase, acetyl cholinesterase, NMDA receptor or L-type calcium channels (Bachurin, S.; Bukatina, E.; et al. Antihistamine agent dimebon as a novel neuroprotector and a cognition enhancer. \nAnn. N. Y. Acad. Sci. \n2001, 939 (Neuroprotective Agents), 425-435. Lermontova, N. N.; Redkozubov, A. E.; et al. Dimebon and tacrine inhibit neurotoxic action of beta-amyloid in culture and block L-type Ca(2+) channels. \nBull. Exp. Biol. Med. \n2001, 132(5), 1079-83. Grigor'ev, V. V.; Dranyi, O. A.; et al. Comparative Study of Action Mechanisms of Dimebon and Memantine on AMPA- and NMDA-Subtypes Glutamate Receptors in Rat Cerebral Neurons. \nBull. Exp. Biol. Med. \n2003, 136(5): 474-477.), its interactions at these targets are weak. More recent data suggest that dimebolin may exert its effects at the level of mitochondria, and that these activities could enhance neuronal function (Hung, D. Dimebon: A \nphase\n 3 investigational agent for Alzheimer's disease with a novel mitochondrial mechanism of action. Presented at the International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease, Chicago, Ill., USA, July 2008; paper S4-04-05.). Hung and coworkers (Hung, D. Dimebon: A \nphase\n 3 investigational agent for Alzheimer's disease with a novel mitochondrial mechanism of action. Presented at the International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease, Chicago, Ill., USA, July 2008; paper S4-04-05.) reported that dimebolin can protect cells from excitotoxic damage and improve neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cell lines and primary neurons. From an adverse effect standpoint, in recently reported clinical studies of dimebolin, the most frequent adverse event was dry mouth, which is consistent with the antihistaminic effects of dimebolin (Doody, R. S.; Gavrilova, S. I.; et al. Effect of dimebon on cognition, activities of daily living, behaviour, and global function in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. \nLancet \n2008, 372(9634), 207-215.). There is a need in the art to identify and provide novel agents for treating or preventing conditions associated neurodegenerative disorders such as AD, lacking histaminergic (H1) interactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted earlier, given the likely multiple etiologies of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, multiple approaches are being pursued as symptomatic approaches or as disease modifying approaches to alter the underlying pathology of the disease (Scatena, R.; Martorana, G. E.; et al. An update on pharmacological approaches to neurodegenerative diseases. \nExpert Opin. Invest. Drugs \n2007, 16(1), 59-72.). In particular, the reported benefit of dimebolin in double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with mild-to-moderate AD across many cognitive and clinical measures demonstrates the potential of such compounds to prevent or treat a variety of neurodegenerative diseases where an underlying pathology involves deficits in cognitive function. In addition to the need for improved receptor selectivity profile (as for example vs. H1 receptors), one of the current limitations with dimebolin is the dosing regimen necessitating three times per day (t.i.d.) administration in humans. As neuroprotective approaches exemplified by dimebolin continue to be validated as a viable clinical approach, there is a need in the art to identify and provide novel compounds for treating or preventing cognitive deficits associated with AD and other neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention relates

These stereoisomers are “R” or “S” depending on the configuration of substituents around the chiral carbon atom. The terms “R” and “S” used herein are configurations as defined in IUPAC 1974 Recommendations for Section E, Fundamental Stereochemistry, Pure Appl. Chem., 1976, 45: 13-30.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn occasion, the relative stereochemistry of an enantiomeric pair is known, however, the absolute configuration is not known. In that circumstance, the relative stereochemistry descriptor terms “R*” and “S*” are used. The terms “R*” and “S*” used herein are defined in Eliel, E. L.; Wilen, S. H. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds; John Wiley & Sons, Inc.: New York, 1994; pp 119-120 and 1206.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present application contemplates various stereoisomers and mixtures thereof and these are specifically included within the scope of this application. Stereoisomers include enantiomers and diastereomers, and mixtures of enantiomers or diastereomers. Individual stereoisomers of compounds of the present application may be prepared synthetically from commercially available starting materials which contain asymmetric or chiral centers or by preparation of racemic mixtures followed by resolution which is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These methods of resolution are exemplified by (1) attachment of a mixture of enantiomers to a chiral auxiliary, separation of the resulting mixture of diastereomers by recrystallization or chromatography and liberation of the optically pure product from the auxiliary or (2) direct separation of the mixture of optical enantiomers on chiral chromatographic columns.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeometric isomers may exist in the compounds of the present invention. The present invention contemplates the various geometric isomers and mixtures thereof resulting from the disposition of substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond, a carbon-nitrogen double bond, a cycloalkyl group, or a heterocycle group. Substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond or a carbon-nitrogen bond are designated as being of Z or E configuration and substituents around a cycloalkyl or a heterocycle are designated as being of cis or trans configuration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithin the present invention it is to be understood that compounds disclosed herein may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism. Thus, the formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric or stereoisomeric forms. It is to be understood that the present invention encompasses any tautomeric or stereoisomeric form, and mixtures thereof, and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric or stereoisomeric form utilized within the naming of the compounds or formulae drawings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of this invention can exist in an isotopic form containing one or more atoms having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most abundantly found in nature. Isotopes of atoms such as hydrogen, carbon, phosphorous, sulfur fluorine, chlorine, and iodine include, but are not limited to \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n11\nC, \n14\nC, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, \n36\nCl, and \n125\nI, respectively. Compounds that contain other isotopes of these and/or other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Compounds containing tritium (\n3\nH) and \n14\nC radioisotopes are preferred in general for their ease in preparation and detectability for radiolabeled compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention can be prepared by the general methods well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. Such Isotopically labeled compounds can be conveniently prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Examples and Schemes below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.\n\n\n \nc. Biological Data\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine the effectiveness of compounds having a formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), or (VI), these compounds can be evaluated in in vitro models of cellular function and in vivo models of pro-cognitive effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAbbreviations which have been used in the descriptions of Biological Data that follow are: DMEM for Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DMSO for dimethyl sulfoxide; FBS for fetal bovine serum; FLIPR for fluorometric imaging plate reader; GFAP for glial fibrillary acidic protein; HBSS for Hank's balanced salt solution; i.p. for intraperitoneal; NGF for nerve growth factor; PBS for phosphate buffered saline; TMRE for tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate; and TRITC for tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate.\n\n\n \n(i) Effects on Neurite Outgrowth in Neurons and Neuronal Cell Lines:\n\n\n \n \n \nEffects on cellular properties such as neurite outgrowth and neuronal or neuronal-like cell number, etc. can be measured either using rat or human neuronal/neuroblastoma cell lines (e.g., SH-SY5Y, PC12, IMR-32, etc.) or using primary cells (e.g., rat cortical neurons). For example, it has been reported that dimebolin can increase neurite outgrowth in primary rat cortical neurons, comparable to that evoked by Brain Derived Neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Hung, D. Dimebon: A \nphase\n 3 investigational agent for Alzheimer's disease with a novel mitochondrial mechanism of action. Presented at the International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease, Chicago, Ill., USA, July 2008; paper S4-04-05.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, studies can be conducted using PC12 cells plated in 96-well plates, treated with or without nerve growth factor (100 ng/mL) for 6 days. Compounds are then added at various concentrations (ranging from 0.1 nM to 30 μM), and incubated for 24 hours. Cells are then fixed and stained by neuron marker β-tubulin (green), and nuclei were stained by Hoechst 33342 (blue). Images are collected using the ImageXpress Micro automatic fluorescent microscopy system (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.) employing a \nNikon\n 10× Plan Fluor objective and Cool Snap HQ CCD camera. The Neurite Outgrowth module in the MetaMorph Imaging software can be used to automatically count neuron-like number, and the extent of neurite outgrowth (See, \nFIG. 1\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to PC12 cells, other cellular model systems may also be used. Rat cortical cells can be cultured and prepared for high content microscopy analysis as previously described (Hu, M.; Schurdak, M. E.; et al. High content screen microscopy analysis of Aβ\n1-42\n-induced neurite outgrowth reduction in rat primary cortical neurons: Neuroprotective effects of a7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligands. \nBrain Res. \n2007, 1151, 227-235.). Briefly, cortical cell cultures are plated at density of 5×10\n5 \ncells/mL onto poly-D-lysine coated 96-well plates and maintained in a cell incubator at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2\n. Experiments are performed using 6-7 day-old cortical cell cultures by treating with test compounds. In some experiments, the effect of test compounds on reversing Aβ toxicity can also be measured (Hu, M.; Schurdak, M. E.; et al. High content screen microscopy analysis of Aβ\n1-42\n-induced neurite outgrowth reduction in rat primary cortical neurons: Neuroprotective effects of α7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligands. \nBrain Res. \n2007, 1151, 227-235.). For assessment of neuroprotective effects, cells are first pretreated with test compounds for about 5 hours. Medium is then replaced with the medium containing freshly prepared about 5 μM Aβ\n1-42 \npeptide in the absence or presence of the test compounds for 3 days. The untreated group contains the same percentage of vehicle (DMSO) as in the treatment groups. Cells are fixed with approximately 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.5% Hoechst 33342 for about 15 minutes, followed by three washes using PBS (pH 7.4) and blocked with 10% donkey serum in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. The cells are then incubated overnight at about 4° C. with mouse anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:100) for staining neurons and rabbit anti-GFAP (1:1000) for staining glia. In the next day, cells are incubated with FITC-labeled anti-mouse and TRITC-labeled anti-rabbit antibodies (1:1000) for about 1 hour at room temperature. After fixing and staining the cells, nuclei (360/400 nm excitation and 465/300 nm emission filters), neuron (475/350 nm excitation and 535/400 nm emission filters) and glial cell (535 nm excitation and 610 nm emission filters) images are collected using the ImageExpress Micro automatic fluorescent microscopy system (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.) employing a \nNikon\n 10× Plan Fluor objective and Cool Snap HQ CCD camera. The Neurite Outgrowth module in the MetaMorph Imaging software can be used to automatically count total cell number, number of neuron cells, and the extent of neurite outgrowth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 2\n, treatment with Example 5 resulted in significant attenuation of the Aβ\n1-42\n-induced reduction of neurite outgrowth in primary postnatal (P0) cortical cells. In the graph of \nFIG. 2\n, 100% response is the response observed for untreated cells. Exposure to Aβ\n1-42 \nproduced a decrease in neurite outgrowth. Treatment of cells with compounds prior to and concomitantly with Aβ\n1\n-\n42 \ngave a neuroprotective effect with neurite outgrowth maintained or enhanced relative to untreated cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 1 shows the maximum response at the noted test compound concentration relative to 300 nM dimebolin.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeurite Outgrowth Assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMaximum Effect (of % 300 nM\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nDimebolin) at Concentration (nM)\n\n\n \nCount\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n117% at 0.03 \nnM\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n123% at 3000 \nnM\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n124% at 3 \nnM\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n 96% at 30 \nnM\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n101% at 30 \nnM\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n133\n\n\n108% at 30 \nnM\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n135\n\n\n126% at 3 \nnM\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n158\n\n\n110% at 30 \nnM\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n165\n\n\n104% at 300 \nnM\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n167\n\n\n 92% at 300 \nnM\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n228\n\n\n141% at 300 \nnM\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n229\n\n\n165% at 300 \nnM\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n(ii) Effects on Aβ\n1-42 \nInduced Tau Phosphorylation in PC12 Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of test compound(s) on Aβ\n1-42 \ninduced tau phosphorylation can be assessed in a cell line such as PC12 as previously described (Hu, M.; Waring, J. F.; et al. Role of GSK-3β activation and α7 nAChRs in Aβ\n1-42\n-induced tau phosphorylation in PC12 cells. \nJ. Neurochem. \n2008, 106(3), 1371-1377.). Briefly, PC12 cells are plated on poly-D-lysine coated 96-well plates, cultured in Ham's F12K medium supplemented with 15% horse serum, 2.5% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2 \nand differentiated with 100 ng/mL NGF for approximately 6 days. Cells are pretreated with test compounds for 30 minutes at about 37° C. The medium is then replaced with that containing freshly prepared Aβ\n1-42 \nor control peptide in the absence or presence of the test compounds and the cells are incubated at 37° C. for 24 hours. Cells are fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for about 1 hour at room temperature followed by permeabilization by three washes with 0.1% Triton-\nX\n 100 in PBS. The fixed cells are incubated with blocking buffer for about 2 hours at room temperature followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies AT8 (for phosphorylated tau), anti-human tau (for total Tau), or anti-GSK-3β. On the next day, cells are washed 3 times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS, then incubated with IRDye® 800CW anti-mouse IgG antibodies (1:100) for 1 hour at room temperature for detection of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) or GSK-3β, or with the Alexa Fluor® 680 anti-rabbit antibodies (1:100) for detection of total tau (t-tau). Cells are then washed three times, and the target signals are simultaneously visualized using Odyssey Infrared Imaging Scanner with the 680-nm fluorophore emitting an image of red color and the 800-nm fluorophore emitting an image of green color. The integrated fluorescence intensities are calculated and analyzed using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System Application Software version 1.2.15 (Li-Cor Biosciences (Lincoln, NB). The p-tau and t-tau levels are typically presented as the ratio p-tau/t-tau (Hu, M.; Waring, J. F.; et al. Role of GSK-3β activation and α7 nAChRs in Aβ\n1-42\n-induced tau phosphorylation in PC12 cells. \nJ. Neurochem. \n2008, 106(3), 1371-1377.).\n\n\n \n \n(iii) Effects on Mitochondrial Function\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method also involves a high-throughput assay using serum-deprivation conditions involving neuronal cells to screen for compounds that increase or preserve mitochondrial membrane potential. Such compounds can be found to aid in rescuing cells from energy-depletion that occurs in several neurodegenerative states. Mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis occurs in response to a wide range of apoptotic stimuli including p53, c-myc, DNA damage, prooxidants, chemotherapeutic agents, serum starvation and death receptor activation (Lin C-H., Lu Y-Z., Cheng, F-C., Chu L-F. and Hsueh C-M. (2005) Bax-regulated mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis is responsible for the in vitro ischemia induced neuronal cell death of Sprague Dawley rat. (Neuroscience Letter 387:22-27).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum deprivation for 16-18 hours initiates the early stages of apoptosis (Chavier D, Lecoeur H, Langonne A, Borgne-Sanchez A, Mariani J., Martinou J-C, Rebouillat D and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nJacotot E. Upstream control of apoptosis by caspase-2 in serum-deprived neurons. Apoptosis 10:1243-1259, 2005) and induces stress on a cell before full commitment to cell death. Mitochondria play a critical role in the cell for survival or death due to their regulation of both energy metabolism as well as apoptosis (Sullivan P G, Rabchevsky A G, Waldmeirer P C and Springer J E. Mitochondrial Permeability Transition in CNS Trauma: Cause or Effect of Neuronal Cell Death. J Neuroscience Res 2005, 79:231-239). One of the first major events to occur in apoptosis is the breakdown of the membranes of the mitochondria to release cytochrome c, activate caspases, change electron transport and cause a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ\nm\n). A change in Δψ\nm \ntherefore serves as a measure of mitochondrial function and indicator of cell health.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, this stress inducer, serum deprivation, combined with monitoring changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential in a 96-well format allows for the establishment of an efficient high-throughput screen (HTS) in order to evaluate the ability of compounds to increase mitochondrial membrane potential in the presence of stress and preserve health of the cell. Exemplary procedures for conducting such high-throughput assay are provided below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTissue Culture: SK—N—SH human neuroblastoma cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.) were maintained in the log phase of growth in Minimal Essential Media (MEM), 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum and 100 units/mL antibiotic-antimycotic (AA). Cells were cultured and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37° C. under 5% CO\n2 \nand 95% air. Cells were trypsinized (0.25%) and subcultured every 3 days and used from 15-18 passages. All cell culture supplies were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum Deprivation/JC-1 Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP) Assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSK—N—SH cells were plated 2-3 days in advance at a concentration of 50,000 cells/well onto collagen coated black-walled 96 well plates (Becton-Dickinson, Bedford, Mass.) in a total volume of 200 μL. On day of experimental treatment, the media containing serum was aspirated from each well and rinsed once with MEM/1% AA without serum. The cells then were incubated overnight in 100 [\n2\nL of MEM/1% AA (no serum) with and without dimebolin or novel chemical entities overnight for ˜18 hours. The following day, JC-1 dye (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanide) was diluted 1:10 into MEM media according to the JC-1 Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assay Kit: (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, Mich.) and then 10 μL of the JC-1 dye solution was added to each well. The plates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 400×g at room temperature followed by 35 minute incubation at 37° C. The plates were washed twice with 200 μL of provided Assay Buffer followed an addition of 100 μL of Assay Buffer to each well. The plates were read with an excitation and emission of 560 nM and 595 nM for red fluorescence and with an excitation and emission of 495 mM and 535 nM for green fluorescence to determine the final JC-1 value taking the red to green fluorescence ratio. This assay is based on change in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) using this lipophilic cationic dye, JC-1, by monitoring the changes in the ratio of red to green fluorescence as the MMP depolarizes. This change in MMP reflects the health of the cell with healthy, viable cells have a high JC-1 ratio and high MMP whereas apoptotic, unhealthy cells have a low JC-1 ratio or low MMP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the ability of compounds to reverse the stress due to serum deprivation and increase the JC-1 ratio, the percent maximal intensity in JC-1 ratio was normalized to that induced by the peak value for 10 μM dimebolin and plotted against the compound concentration to calculate EC\n50 \nvalues and to control for plate-to-plate variability. Concentration-response data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, Calif.); the EC\n50 \nvalues were derived from a single curve fit to the mean data of n=2−3, in duplicates. Selected data is shown in Table 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10 mM stock solutions and tested at a concentration that the dimethyl sulfoxide levels never exceeded 1%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 3\n, treatment of SK—N—SH cells with Example 5 maintained mitochondrial function in a dose dependent manner.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJC-1 Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP) Assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEC\n50\n \n\n\nJC-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n(mM)\n\n\nmax %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n5.11\n\n\n191\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n12.98\n\n\n209\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n5.79\n\n\n163\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n5.58\n\n\n181\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n4.79\n\n\n110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n8.38\n\n\n129\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n3.53\n\n\n345\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n3.19\n\n\n307\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n3.32\n\n\n332\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n2.26\n\n\n221\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n6.05\n\n\n97\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n17.32\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n5.81\n\n\n97\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34\n\n\n18.09\n\n\n175\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\n6.71\n\n\n78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\n7.64\n\n\n202\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\n3.31\n\n\n291\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n6.45\n\n\n175\n\n\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\n4.14\n\n\n202\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\n4.37\n\n\n211\n\n\n\n\n\n\n67\n\n\n6.49\n\n\n132\n\n\n\n\n\n\n68\n\n\n3.22\n\n\n213\n\n\n\n\n\n\n69\n\n\n4.43\n\n\n161\n\n\n\n\n\n\n77\n\n\n9.22\n\n\n223\n\n\n\n\n\n\n78\n\n\n9.69\n\n\n211\n\n\n\n\n\n\n84\n\n\n6.76\n\n\n173\n\n\n\n\n\n\n87\n\n\n3.33\n\n\n139\n\n\n\n\n\n\n90\n\n\n3.43\n\n\n176\n\n\n\n\n\n\n91\n\n\n6.33\n\n\n129\n\n\n\n\n\n\n93\n\n\n4.81\n\n\n186\n\n\n\n\n\n\n96\n\n\n4.41\n\n\n169\n\n\n\n\n\n\n97\n\n\n5.13\n\n\n164\n\n\n\n\n\n\n98\n\n\n7.26\n\n\n176\n\n\n\n\n\n\n99\n\n\n3.07\n\n\n138\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n3.63\n\n\n140\n\n\n\n\n\n\n103\n\n\n4.17\n\n\n180\n\n\n\n\n\n\n104\n\n\n4.16\n\n\n178\n\n\n\n\n\n\n105\n\n\n3.88\n\n\n129\n\n\n\n\n\n\n106\n\n\n5.73\n\n\n238\n\n\n\n\n\n\n107\n\n\n4.08\n\n\n153\n\n\n\n\n\n\n112\n\n\n3.43\n\n\n101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n113\n\n\n2.99\n\n\n353\n\n\n\n\n\n\n120\n\n\n3.40\n\n\n197\n\n\n\n\n\n\n121\n\n\n3.63\n\n\n129\n\n\n\n\n\n\n122\n\n\n5.29\n\n\n141\n\n\n\n\n\n\n127\n\n\n3.69\n\n\n151\n\n\n\n\n\n\n140\n\n\n3.32\n\n\n194\n\n\n\n\n\n\n146\n\n\n2.84\n\n\n264\n\n\n\n\n\n\n147\n\n\n2.53\n\n\n266\n\n\n\n\n\n\n148\n\n\n3.52\n\n\n99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n150\n\n\n3.60\n\n\n134\n\n\n\n\n\n\n151\n\n\n5.38\n\n\n121\n\n\n\n\n\n\n152\n\n\n3.86\n\n\n156\n\n\n\n\n\n\n154\n\n\n30.00\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n155\n\n\n7.53\n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n159\n\n\n2.67\n\n\n240\n\n\n\n\n\n\n160\n\n\n1.61\n\n\n194\n\n\n\n\n\n\n162\n\n\n16.97\n\n\n205\n\n\n\n\n\n\n163\n\n\n4.03\n\n\n140\n\n\n\n\n\n\n164\n\n\n4.95\n\n\n197\n\n\n\n\n\n\n167\n\n\n4.71\n\n\n149\n\n\n\n\n\n\n173\n\n\n6.15\n\n\n120\n\n\n\n\n\n\n174\n\n\n5.48\n\n\n105\n\n\n\n\n\n\n178\n\n\n4.17\n\n\n192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n179\n\n\n5.69\n\n\n116\n\n\n\n\n\n\n181\n\n\n7.89\n\n\n103\n\n\n\n\n\n\n182\n\n\n9.28\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n183\n\n\n8.97\n\n\n172\n\n\n\n\n\n\n184\n\n\n10.70\n\n\n175\n\n\n\n\n\n\n185\n\n\n8.58\n\n\n184\n\n\n\n\n\n\n186\n\n\n14.57\n\n\n93\n\n\n\n\n\n\n187\n\n\n9.37\n\n\n110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n188\n\n\n6.52\n\n\n96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n189\n\n\n11.35\n\n\n107\n\n\n\n\n\n\n190\n\n\n5.06\n\n\n175\n\n\n\n\n\n\n191\n\n\n7.04\n\n\n112\n\n\n\n\n\n\n194\n\n\n2.18\n\n\n321\n\n\n\n\n\n\n196\n\n\n3.91\n\n\n182\n\n\n\n\n\n\n197\n\n\n5.63\n\n\n173\n\n\n\n\n\n\n202\n\n\n3.07\n\n\n239\n\n\n\n\n\n\n203\n\n\n4.53\n\n\n159\n\n\n\n\n\n\n204\n\n\n3.23\n\n\n182\n\n\n\n\n\n\n213\n\n\n5.43\n\n\n177\n\n\n\n\n\n\n215\n\n\n3.34\n\n\n196\n\n\n\n\n\n\n216\n\n\n4.20\n\n\n284\n\n\n\n\n\n\n217\n\n\n2.94\n\n\n182\n\n\n\n\n\n\n219\n\n\n3.07\n\n\n201\n\n\n\n\n\n\n222\n\n\n4.43\n\n\n215\n\n\n\n\n\n\n223\n\n\n3.84\n\n\n287\n\n\n\n\n\n\n224\n\n\n3.17\n\n\n215\n\n\n\n\n\n\n225\n\n\n2.74\n\n\n209\n\n\n\n\n\n\n226\n\n\n1.68\n\n\n307\n\n\n\n\n\n\n227\n\n\n3.62\n\n\n266\n\n\n\n\n\n\n228\n\n\n1.73\n\n\n263\n\n\n\n\n\n\n229\n\n\n0.70\n\n\n282\n\n\n\n\n\n\n232\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n220\n\n\n\n\n\n\n233\n\n\n0.80\n\n\n250\n\n\n\n\n\n\n234\n\n\n1.27\n\n\n281\n\n\n\n\n\n\n235\n\n\n3.96\n\n\n252\n\n\n\n\n\n\n236\n\n\n1.74\n\n\n268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n237\n\n\n2.48\n\n\n174\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n(iv) In Vivo Models of Procognitive Effects\n\n\n \n \n \nA range of animal models capturing diverse cognitive domains may be utilized for assessing procognitive effects of compounds. Examples of these models are provided in Bitner et al., (Bitner, R. S.; Bunnelle, W. H.; et al. Broad-spectrum efficacy across cognitive domains by α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonism correlates with activation of ERK1/2 and CREB phosphorylation pathways. \nJ. Neurosci. \n2007, 27(39), 10578-10587.). Various transgenic animal models that are relevant of neurodegenerative diseases of interest may also be utilized to assess effects of test compounds (Goetz, J.; Ittner, L. M. Animal models of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. \nNat. Rev. Neurosci. \n2008, 9(7), 532-544.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibitory Avoidance in Mouse: The inhibitory avoidance task involves the uses of a two-compartment step through apparatus (Ugo Basile, Collegeville, Pa.) that measures the animal's ability to remember a brief noxious stimulus (foot shock), and is considered a measure of trial learning, and memory consolidation. Briefly, mice were placed in a lighted compartment of the apparatus where the latency to enter into the preferred dark compartment is recorded. Entry into a dark compartment results in the immediate delivery of a mild foot shock (0.2 mA, 1-second duration). Retention testing is conducted 24 hours later with the animal again placed in the lighted compartment where its latency to reenter the dark side of the apparatus is measured (no shock). Increasing retention latency is regarded as an index of memory consolidation (Bitner, R. S.; Bunnelle, W. H.; et al. Broad-spectrum efficacy across cognitive domains by a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonism correlates with activation of ERK1/2 and CREB phosphorylation pathways. \nJ. Neurosci. \n2007, 27(39), 10578-10587.). As shown in \nFIG. 4\n, the latency to reenter the dark side (punishment side) is significantly increased upon dosing with Example 5 at 0.11 mg/kg and 1.1 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSocial Recognition in Rat: The social recognition test measures short-term memory on the basis of olfactory cues, and depends on the hippocampus. Adult (350-450 g) rats are allowed to interact with a juvenile(60-80 g) rat for a 5 minute interaction trial (T1) in which the adult exhibits behaviors that included close following, grooming and/or sniffing of the juvenile for as much as 40-50% of the trial duration. The juvenile rat is then removed and the adult rat immediately administered various doses of test compound. A second 5 minute recognition trial (T2) is conducted 120 minutes later where interactive behavior of the adult rat is again monitored. If recognition memory is lost over the 120 minute interval between trials, the interactive behavior would be similar for the two trials; however, if memory is retained, the recognition ratio (T2:T1) would decline, i.e. deceasing T2:T1 ratio is regarded as an index of improved short-term recognition memory (Bitner, R. S.; Bunnelle, W. H.; et al. Broad-spectrum efficacy across cognitive domains by α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonism correlates with activation of ERK1/2 and CREB phosphorylation pathways. \nJ. Neurosci. \n2007, 27(39), 10578-10587. Timmermann, D. B.; Groenlien, J. H.; et al. An allosteric modulator of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor possessing cognition-enhancing properties in vivo. \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n2007, 323(1), 294-307.). As shown in \nFIG. 5\n, the recognition ratio (T2:T1) declined significantly upon dosing intraperitoneally with Example 5 at 0.11 and 1.1 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelayed Matching-to-Sample (DMTS) Titration in Monkey: Studies can be conducted in Rhesus monkeys that were initially trained in the DMTS procedure (Buccafusco, J. J.; Terry, A. V.; et al. Profile of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists ABT-594 and A-582941, with differential subtype selectivity, on delayed matching accuracy by young monkeys. \nBiochem. Pharmacol. \n2007, 74(8), 1202-1211.). Using a touch-sensitive screen in the animals home-cage, trial initiation consists of presentation of one of three colored stimuli (red, blue, or yellow rectangles) that remain in view (sample stimuli) until touched by subject. Following a delay interval, two choice rectangles are presented, one being the previous sample stimulus, in which correct (matching) choice-touch to the sample stimuli is food reinforced. For standard DMTS testing, the duration for each delay interval is adjusted for each subject until three levels of performance accuracy were approximated: zero delay (85-100% of trials answered correctly); short delay interval (75-84% correct); medium delay interval (65-74% correct); and long delay interval (55-64% correct). The titration version of the DMTS task used in the present studies requires the animals to perform a 96 trial session that begins with a 0 sec delay interval. If the trial is answered correctly, a 1 second delay interval is presented during the next trial presented. The 1 second incremental progression is maintained until the subject made an incorrect match. The delay interval for the trial after an incorrect match is always decreased by 1 second. After an incorrect match, if the next trial is answered correctly, then the subsequent trial presented a \ndelay interval\n 1 second longer in duration. Dependent variables include the overall % of trials answered correctly, the number of trials to reach the maximal delay interval attained, and the maximum and average delay interval attained (in seconds). Compounds are administered prior to DMTS testing.\n\n\n \n(v) Determination of Analgesic Effect Against Neuropathic Pain\n\n\n \n \n \nAnimals were prepared for testing, by use of a surgical procedure that induces neuropathic pain in one paw. Male Sprague Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River (Portage, Mich.). Prior to surgery, animals were housed in groups and maintained in a temperature-regulated environment. Following nerve ligation surgery, animals were housed in groups, and had access to food and water ad libitum. The L5 and L6 spinal nerves of anesthetized rats were tightly ligated in a manner described previously (see Kim and Chung, Pain (1992) vol. 50 pp. 355-363). An incision was made on the dorsal portion of the hip and the muscle was blunt-dissected to reveal the spinal processes. The L6 transverse process was removed, and the left side L5 and L6 spinal nerves were tightly ligated with 5.0 braided silk suture. The wound was cleaned, the membrane sewn with 4.0 dissolvable Vicryl suture and the skin closed with wound clips. The paw affected by the surgical procedure (the left paw) develops an allodynic response, a hypersensitivity to mechanical and other stimuli; neuropathic pain is assessed as an increased sensitivity in the surgically affected (left) allodynic paw compared to the control paw on the right side, and measured by comparing the response of the (left side) allodynic paw to the response of the unaffected right side control paw.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the assessment of neuropathic pain, mechanical allodynia in the affected paw of animals that had undergone spinal nerve ligation was evaluated using testing with von Frey filaments. As described previously by S. R. Chaplan, et al (“Quantitative assessment of tactile allodynia in the rat paw” J. Neurosci. Meth. (1994) vol. 53 pp. 55-63), two weeks following surgery rats were acclimated to a testing box constructed of plexiglass with a wire mesh floor which allowed access to the plantar surface of the animal's hindpaws. Using an Up-Down method (Dixon, Annual Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. (1980) vol. 20, pp. 441-462; Chaplan et al. “Quantitative assessment of tactile allodynia in the rat paw” J. Neuroscience Methods (1994) vol. 53 pp. 55-63), von Frey filaments of increasing stiffness were applied to the plantar surface of the hindpaws and the withdrawal response of the animals was observed; for the surgically affected paw with neuropathic pain (the left side paw) the baseline level of allodynia has a withdrawal threshold of ≦4 g of pressure. By comparison, for the control paw without allodynia (in this case the right side paw), the typical withdrawal pressure is around 15 g. Representative compounds of the invention, administered intraperitoneally 30 minutes before testing, are able to reduce the symptoms of neuropathic pain and induce a dose-dependent increase in the withdrawal threshold for allodynic (left side) limb, up to a maximum effect of 15 g. The efficacy of the compound in reducing neuropathic pain at different doses is determined by comparing response in the surgery-affected paw versus the response in the control paw. This is expressed as the MPE (maximum potential effect). In this model, the compound of Example 2 (9-methyl-6-[2-(6-methylpyridin-3-yl)ethyl]-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-2,5-ethanoazepino[4,3-b]indole) was very effective, producing a 58% reduction (**p<0.01, ***p<0.001 vs. vehicle) in the withdrawal threshold at a dose of 10 mg/kg, administered by intraperitoneal injection as shown in \nFIG. 6\n. Example 2 was dosed i.p. (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, 2 mL/kg) in vehicle (10% dimethyl sulfoxide/HBC). Gabapentin (100 mg/kg, 2.0 mL/kg) was used as an internal control. Test animals were used 2.5 weeks post-surgery. No complicating adverse effects were observed.\n\n\n \n(vi) Animal Pharmacokinetics\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of test compounds can be assessed in mouse, rat, dog and monkey to obtain various parameters including clearance (Clp), volume of distribution and bioavailability. For the determination of plasma and brain concentrations of the parent compound, naïve rats or mice can be dosed with the compounds i.p. and sacrificed at various time points post-dosing. For the determination of plasma concentrations, blood is collected into heparinized tubes and then centrifuged, and the separated plasma is frozen at −20° C. until analysis. For analysis, compounds are extracted from the samples via liquid-liquid extraction and quantified by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy.\n\n\n \nd. Methods of Using the Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nIn still yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for preventing or treating a disease condition in a subject in need of treatment thereof. The subject in need of treatment thereof can be a mammal, such as, but not limited to, a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the disease condition is a neurodegeneration disorder. A neurodegeneration disorder refers to a type of neurological disease marked by the loss of nerve cells in the brain or central nervous system. Examples of neurodegeneration disorders include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), age-associated memory impairment (AAMI), multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, vascular dementia, senile dementia, AIDS dementia, Pick's disease, dementia caused by cerebrovascular disorders, corticobasal degeneration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, diminished CNS function associated with traumatic brain injury or any combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the disease condition is a neuropsychiatric disorder. A neuropsychiatric disorder is a behavioral or psychological problem associated with a known neurological condition, and typically defined as a cluster of symptoms that co-exist. Examples of neuropsychiatric disorders include, but are not limited to, schizophrenia, cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar and manic disorders, depression or any combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, the present invention relates to methods of preventing or treating a pain including neuropathic and nociceptive pain, chronic or acute, such as, without limitation, allodynia, inflammatory pain, inflammatory hyperalgesia, post herpetic neuralgia, neuropathies, neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, HIV-related neuropathy, nerve injury, rheumatoid arthritic pain, osteoarthritic pain, burns, back pain, ocular pain, visceral pain, cancer pain, dental pain, headache, migraine, carpal tunnel syndrome, fibromyalgia, neuritis, sciatica, pelvic hypersensitivity, pelvic pain, post operative pain, post stroke pain, and menstrual pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCognitive deficits are recognized in various forms of neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric disorders (such as, but not limited to, dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, (AD) and neuropsychiatric diseases, particularly schizophrenia and bipolar disorders). For example, in AD, current therapies offer modest efficacy, and therefore, there is need for an agent that offers a superior clinical benefit. One such agent, dimebolin, has been shown to inhibit neuronal death in models of neurodegenerative diseases suggestive of modification of disease processes (Lermontova, N. N.; Lukoyanov, N. V.; et al. Dimebon improves learning in animals with experimental Alzheimer's disease. \nBull. Exp. Biol. Med. \n2000, 129(6), 544-546. Bachurin, S.; Bukatina, E.; et al. Antihistamine agent dimebon as a novel neuroprotector and a cognition enhancer. \nAnn. N. Y. Acad. Sci. \n2001, 939 (Neuroprotective Agents), 425-435.) and more recently, shown to possess beneficial effect in cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease (Burns, A.; Jacoby, R. Dimebon in Alzheimer's disease: old drug for new indication. \nLancet \n2008, 372(9634), 179-80. Doody, R. S.; Gavrilova, S. I.; et al. Effect of dimebon on cognition, activities of daily living, behaviour, and global function in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. \nLancet \n2008, 372(9634), 207-215.). Patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease administered with 20 mg three times a day (60 mg/day) showed significant improvement in the clinical course of disease, as reflected in improvement over baseline for ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer's disease assessment scale—cognitive subscale) (Cummings, J.; Doody, R.; Gavrilova, S.; Sano, M.; Aisen, P.; Seely, L.; Hung, D. 18-month data from an open-label extension of a one-year controlled trial of dimebon in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Presented at the International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (ICAD), Chicago, Ill., USA, July 2008; paper P4-334). Patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease who had earlier received the drug for 12 months had preservation of function close to their starting baseline on key symptoms of Alzheimer's disease indicated the ability of dimebolin to alter disease progression. Patients originally on placebo who received dimebolin in the extension study showed stabilization across all key measures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBeneficial effects of agents such as dimebolin have been linked to diverse mechanisms of action including effects at the level of mitochondria. In particular, dimebolin has been reported to improve neuronal function by enhancing neuronal outgrowth and affecting mitochondrial function. For example, Hung and coworkers (Hung, D. Dimebon: A \nphase\n 3 investigational agent for Alzheimer's disease with a novel mitochondrial mechanism of action. Presented at the International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease, Chicago, Ill., USA, July 2008; paper S4-04-05.) reported that dimebolin can protect cells from excitotoxic damage and improve neurite outgrowth in in vitro model systems. Other mechanisms of action may also contribute to its beneficial effects of compounds with a “dimebolin-like” profile. Indeed, multi-targeted mechanisms have been proposed as viable approaches for treatment of diverse neurodegenerative diseases (Zhang, H.-Y. One-compound-multiple-targets strategy to combat Alzheimer's disease. \nFEBS Lett. \n2005, 579, 5260-5264. Youdim, M.; Buccafusco, J. Multi-functional drugs for various CNS targets in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. \nTrends in Pharm. Sci. \n2005, 26(1), 27-35. Csermely, P.; Agoston, V.; Pongor, S. The efficiency of multi-target drugs: the network approach might help drug design. \nTrends in Pharm. Sci. \n2005, 26(4), 178-182. Cavalli, A.; Bolognesi, M. L.; Minarini, A.; Rosini, M.; Tumiatti, V.; Recanatini, M.; Melchiorre, C. Multi-target directed ligands to combat neurodegenerative diseases. \nJ. Med. Chem. \n2008, 51(3), 347-372.). Dimebolin is also thought to exert its cognitive enhancing effects also through inhibition of butyryl-cholinesterase, acetyl cholinesterase, NMDA receptor or L-type calcium channels (Bachurin, S.; Bukatina, E.; et al. Antihistamine agent dimebon as a novel neuroprotector and a cognition enhancer. \nAnn. N. Y. Acad. Sci. \n2001, 939 (Neuroprotective Agents), 425-435. Lermontova, N. N.; Redkozubov, A. E.; et al. Dimebon and tacrine inhibit neurotoxic action of beta-amyloid in culture and block L-type Ca(2+) channels. \nBull. Exp. Biol. Med. \n2001, 132(5), 1079-83. Grigor'ev, V. V.; Dranyi, O. A.; et al. Comparative Study of Action Mechanisms of Dimebon and Memantine on AMPA- and NMDA-Subtypes Glutamate Receptors in Rat Cerebral Neurons. \nBull. Exp. Biol. Med. \n2003, 136(5): 474-477.). Interactions at the level of select 5HT receptors have also been implicated in the beneficial cognitive of dimebolin-like analogs (Tkachenko, S. Discovery and in vivo evaluation of potent 5-ht6 receptor antagonists for cognition enhancement in treating Alzheimer's disease. Presented at the International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (ICAD), Chicago, Ill., USA, July 2008; paper P2-478.). Thus, available preclinical and clinical data suggests that compounds exhibiting a “dimebolin-like” profile can be beneficial in treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Therefore, it is believed that the compounds of the present invention exhibit at least one of the mechanisms of action exhibited by dimebolin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor treating a neurodegenerative or a neuropsychiatric disorder, the method comprises administering to the subject in need of treatment thereof (e.g., a mammal, such as a human) a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Alternatively, the method comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of at least one cognitive enhancing drug. A “cognitive enhancing drug”, as defined herein, is a drug that improves impaired human cognitive abilities of the brain (namely, thinking, learning, and memory). Cognitive enhancing drugs work by altering the availability of neurochemicals (e.g., neurotransmitters, enzymes, and hormones), by improving oxygen supply, by stimulating nerve growth, or by inhibiting nerve damage. Examples of cognitive enhancing drugs include a compound that increases the activity of acetylcholine such as, but not limited to, an acetylcholine receptor agonist (e.g., a nicotinic alpha-7 receptor agonist or allosteric modulator, an alpha4 beta2 nicotinic receptor agonist or allosteric modulators), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (e.g., donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine), a butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (e.g., memantine), an activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) agonist, a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist (e.g., xaliproden), a 5-HT\n4 \nreceptor agonist, a 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonist, a serotonin 1A receptor antagonist, a histamine H\n3 \nreceptor antagonist, a calpain inhibitor, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein or agonist, a trophic growth factor, an anti-apoptotic compound, an AMPA-type glutamate receptor activator, a L-type or N-type calcium channel blocker or modulator, a potassium channel blocker, a hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) activator, a HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylase inhibitor, an anti-inflammatory agent, an inhibitor of amyloid Aβ peptide or amyloid plaque, an inhibitor of tau hyperphosphorylation, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (e.g., tadalafil, sildenafil), a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Specific examples of such cognitive enhancing drugs include, but are not limited to, cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil (Aricept®), rivastigmine (Exelon®), galanthamine (Reminyl), N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists such as memantine (Namenda®). At least one cognitive enhancing drug can be administered simultaneously with the compounds of the present invention or sequentially with the compounds of the present invention (and in any order). Additionally, it is believed that the combinations described herein may have additive or synergistic effects when used in the above-described treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn still yet another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for preventing (the development of) a disease condition, such as a neurodegeneration disorder or a neuropsychiatric disorder. As used herein, the term “prevent” a disease condition, such as a neurodegenerative disorder or a neuropsychiatric disorder by administration of any of the compounds described herein means that the detectable physical characteristics or symptoms of the disease or condition do not develop following the administration of the compound described herein. Specifically, the method of the present invention comprises administering to the subject in need of treatment thereof (e.g., a mammal, such as a human) a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Alternatively, the method comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of at least one cognitive enhancing drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn still yet another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for preventing the progression (e.g., worsening) of a disease condition, such as a neurodegeneration disorder or a neuropsychiatric disorder. The method comprises administering to the subject in need of treatment thereof (e.g., a mammal, such as a human) a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Alternatively, the method comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of at least one cognitive enhancing drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above described methods for preventing the development or progression of a neurodegeneration disorder or a neuropsychiatric disorder one or more biomarkers, diagnostic tests or combination of biomarkers and diagnostic tests known to those skilled the art can be used to determine whether or not (1) a subject is at risk of developing one or more of neurodegeneration disorders or neuropsychiatric disorders; or (2) the neurodegeneration disorders or neuropsychiatric disorders in the subject previously diagnosed with one or more of the aforementioned disorders is progressing (e.g., worsening).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more biomarkers, diagnostic tests or combinations of biomarkers and diagnostic tests known in the art can be used to identify subjects who are at risk of developing a neurodegeneration disorder or a neuropsychiatric disorder. Likewise, one or more biomarkers, diagnostic tests or combinations of biomarkers and diagnostic tests known in the art can be used to determine the progression of the disease or condition of subjects who have been identified as suffering from a neurodegeneration disorder or a neuropsychiatric disorder. For example, one or more biological markers, neuroimaging markers or combination of biological or neuroimaging markers (e.g., MRI, etc.) can be used to identify subjects at risk of developing AD or, for those subjects identified as suffering AD, the progression of the disease. Biological markers that can be examined include, but are not limited to, beta-amyloid\n1-42\n, tau, phosphorylated tau (ptau), plasma Aβ antibodies, α-antichymotrypsin, amyloid precursor protein, APP isoform ratio in platelets, β-secretase (also known as BACE), CD59, 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanine, glutamine synthetase, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), antibodies to GFAP, interleukin-6-receptor complex, kallikrein, melanotransferrin, neurofilament proteins, nitrotyrosine, oxysterols, sulphatides, synaptic markers, S100β, NPS, plasma signaling proteins, etc., or any combinations thereof (See, Shaw, L., et al., \n \nNature Reviews\n \n2007, 6, 295-303. Borroni, B., et al., \n \nCurrent Medicinal Chemistry\n \n2007, 14, 1171-1178. Phillips, K., et al., \n \nNature Reviews\n \n2006, 5 463-469. Bouwman, F. H., et al., \nNeurology \n2007, 69, 1006-1011; Ray, S., et al., \nNature Medicine \n2007, 13(11), 1359-1362. Cummings, J., et al., \nNeurology \n2007, 69, 1622-1634.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActual dosage levels of active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active compound(s) that is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular subject (e.g., a mammal, preferably, a human (patient)), compositions and mode of administration. The selected dosage level will depend upon the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the severity of the condition being treated and the condition and prior medical history of the patient being treated. However, it is within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention can also be administered to a subject as a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compounds of interest in combination with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The phrase “therapeutically effective amount” of the compound of the present invention means a sufficient amount of the compound to treat disorders, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well-known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a subject (namely, a mammal, such as a human) ranges from about 0.01 mg/kg body weight to about 100 mg/kg body weight. More preferable doses can be in the range of from about 0.01 mg/kg body weight to about 30 mg/kg body weight. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration. Consequently, single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose.\n\n\n \ne. Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise the compounds of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise compounds of the present invention that can be formulated together with at least one non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising compounds of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, alone or in combination with one or more compounds that are not the compounds of the present invention. Examples of one or more compounds that can be combined with the compounds of the present invention in pharmaceutical compositions, include, but are not limited to, one or more cognitive enhancing drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this present invention can be administered to a subject (e.g., a mammal, such as a human) orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments or drops), bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. The term “parenterally” as used herein, refers to modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” as used herein, means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as, but not limited to, lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as, but not limited to, corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as, but not limited to, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as, but not limited to, cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as, but not limited to, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as, but not limited to, ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as, but not limited to, magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as, but not limited to, sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and the like), vegetable oils (such as olive oil), injectable organic esters (such as ethyl oleate) and suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This can be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInjectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol and silicic acid; b) binders such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose and acacia; c) humectants such as glycerol; d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates and sodium carbonate; e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin; f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; g) wetting agents such as cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such carriers as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well-known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and may also be of a composition such that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-mentioned carriers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan and mixtures thereof\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBesides inert diluents, the oral compositions may also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, tragacanth and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating carriers or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals which are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the present invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients and the like. The preferred lipids are natural and synthetic phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins) used separately or together.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods to form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example, Prescott, Ed., \nMethods in Cell Biology, \nVolume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. (1976), p. 33 et seq.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage forms for topical administration of a compound of the present invention include powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives, buffers or propellants which may be required. Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be used in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts derived from inorganic or organic acids. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” means those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, S. M. Berge et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in (J. Pharmaceutical\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSciences, 1977, 66: 1 et seq.). The salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention or separately by reacting a free base function with a suitable organic acid. Representative acid addition salts include, but are not limited to acetate, adipate, alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, digluconate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethansulfonate (isothionate), lactate, malate, maleate, methanesulfonate, nicotinate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate, palmitoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, phosphate, glutamate, bicarbonate, p-toluenesulfonate and undecanoate. Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups can be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl halides such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides such as, but not limited to, decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; arylalkyl halides like benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products are thereby obtained. Examples of acids which can be employed to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include such inorganic acids as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid and such organic acids as acetic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, 4-methylbenzenesulfonic acid, succinic acid and citric acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBasic addition salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of compounds of this invention by reacting a carboxylic acid-containing moiety with a suitable base such as, but not limited to, the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation or with ammonia or an organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, cations based on alkali metals or alkaline earth metals such as, but not limited to, lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and aluminum salts and the like and nontoxic quaternary ammonia and amine cations including ammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, diethylamine, ethylamine and the like. Other representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperidine, piperazine and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEsters can be prepared from substrates of formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V) or (VI) containing either a hydroxyl group or a carboxy group by general methods known to persons skilled in the art. The typical reactions of these compounds are substitutions replacing one of the heteroatoms by another atom, for example:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmides can be prepared from substrates of formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V) or (VI) containing either an amino group or a carboxy group in similar fashion. Esters can also react with amines or ammonia to form amides.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother way to make amides from compounds of formula (I) is to heat carboxylic acids and amines together.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also contemplates compounds of the present invention formed by synthetic means or formed by in vivo biotransformation of a prodrug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms, such as hemi-hydrates. In general, the solvated forms, with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water and ethanol among others are equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the invention.\n\n\n \nf. Screening Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the present invention relates to methods for identifying one or more target compounds that can be used to prevent or treat a neurodegenerative disorder or a neuropsychiatric disorder in a subject in need of treatment thereof. Preferably, the methods of the present invention allow for the identification of one or more target compounds in a high throughput manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method of the present invention involves providing a population of neuronal or neuroblastoma cells or neuronal or neuroblastoma cell lines. Examples of neuronal or neuroblastoma cells or cell lines that can be used in this method include, but are not limited to, PC12, SH—SY5Y, SK—N—SH, IMR-32, or dissociated cells from tissues such as neonatal rat cortex or hippocampus cells. One or more target compounds are added to the population of neuronal or neuroblastoma cells or cell lines. If more then one target compound is being added, the target compounds can all be the same compounds but added in varying concentrations (such as, for example, 0.1 nM to 30 micromolar). Alternatively, the target compounds can all be different compounds. After addition of one or more target compounds to the population of cells or cell lines described above, the cells or cell lines are allowed to incubate for a period from at least one 1 hour to about 72 hours, preferably about 24 hours. The neuronal number and neurite outgrowth can then be determined using routine techniques known in the art. For example, the cells or cell lines can be fixed and then stained using any stain known in the art, such as, for example, β-tubulin (green). The total cell number and the extent of neurite outgrowth can be determined using the Neurite Outgrowth module in the MetaMorph Imaging software (Commercially available from Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). Target compounds that cause an increase in neuronal number and/or neuronal outgrowth are selected for further testing for use in preventing or treating a neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethod details are described above in the Biological Data section in the description of the Effects on Mitochondrial Function assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne advantage of the assay is that after a 16-18 hours stress of serum deprivation, the health of the mitochondria can be measure by a 30 minute step with a fluorescent dye, JC-1. JC-1 measures the change in mitochondria membrane potential by measuring red fluorescence with excitation/emission at 560/595 nM, which is high for healthy cells and green fluorescence with excitation/emission at 485/535 nM), which is low if cells are unhealthy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother advantage of the assay is that the assay can measure the effect of mitochondrial function of multiple compounds in either a 1 point concentration or a 9-point dose response curve in a 96-well based format.\n\n\n \ng.

Compounds of formula (10-2) can also be converted to compounds of formula (10-6) by reacting with compounds of formula (10-5) first in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride or lithium diisopropylamide and subsequently with triethylsilane and trifluoroacetic acid or hydrogen in the presence of palladium. Compounds of formula (10-6) are transformed to compounds of formula (10-7) by treatment with hydrazine hydrate in optionally heated ethanol (Nara, S.; Sakamoto, T.; Miyazawa, E.; Kikugawa, Y. \nSynth.

Compounds of formula (10-7) can be used in \n \n \nSchemes\n \n \n 3, 5 or 6 to produce compounds of formulas (I), (IV), or (VI).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (10-6), wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare as defined in formulas (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), and (VI), and G\n1 \nis defined in the Summary of the Invention, can be prepared as described in Scheme 11. N-Aminophthalimide (11-1) can be reacted under the various alkylating conditions described in \nScheme\n 10 for the conversion of compounds of formula (10-2) to compounds of formula (10-6) to supply compounds of formula (11-2). Compounds of formula (11-2) can be arylated with compounds of formula (1-2) wherein Hal is a halogen limited to iodine or bromine, in the presence of palladium(II) acetate, tri-t-butyl phosphine in the presence of cesium carbonate in heated toluene (Kang, H.-M.; Shin, I.-J.; Kim, H.-Y.; Cho, C.-G. \nOrg. Lett. \n2006, 8, 2047-2050). Alternatively, compounds of formula (11-2) can be transformed to compounds of formula (10-6) by treatment with compounds of formula (1-2), wherein Hal is limited to iodine, in the presence of copper(II) acetate, cesium carbonate, and 1,10-phenanthroline. Another alternative involves the reaction of compounds of formula (11-2) with compounds of formula (11-3) in the presence of a base such as triethylamine and a catalyst such as copper(II) acetate in optionally heated dichloromethane (Nara, S.; Sakamoto, T.; Miyazawa, E.; Kikugawa, Y. \nSynth. Commun. \n2003, 33, 87098). Compounds of formula (10-6) can then be further used as described in \nScheme\n 10.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formulas (2-4), (10-3), (10-4) and (10-5) that are used in \nSchemes\n 10 and 11 can be prepared by one skilled in the art. G\n1 \nis as described in the Summary of the Invention and for the methodology described in \nScheme\n 12 is preferentially aryl or heteroaryl. For example, esters of formula (12-1) can be converted to compounds of formula (2-4) in a three step process. To that end, esters of formula (12-1) can be first reduced with a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride and then subsequently oxidized with a reagent such as manganese(II) oxide to supply the corresponding aldehyde. The aldehyde can then be reacted with methylene(triphenyl)phosphorane to furnish compounds of formula (2-4), wherein R\n5a \nis hydrogen. Alternatively, compounds of formula (2-4), wherein R\n5a \nis hydrogen, can be prepared from aryl bromides or heteroaryl bromides of formula (12-2). Accordingly compounds of formula (12-2) are reacted with either potassium vinyltrifluoroborate or triethoxy(vinyl)silane in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide and a palladium catalyst such as palladium acetate or phenone oxime-derived palladacycles either conventionally heated or heated in a microwave (Alacid, E.; Najera, C. \nJ. Org. Chem. \n2008, 73(6), 2315-2322. Gordillo, A.; de Jesus, E.; Lopez-Mardomingo, C. \nChem. Comm. \n2007, (39), 4056-4058.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (12-1) can also be converted to compounds of formula (10-4). Once again, esters of formula (12-1) can be first reduced with a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride and then oxidized with a reagent such as manganese(II) oxide to supply the corresponding aldehyde. Subsequent Wittig reaction with (methoxymethyl)triphenylphosphonium chloride and t-butoxide in mixture of glyme and toluene (Kawai, A.; Hara, 0.; Hamada, Y.; Shiori, T. \nTetrahedron Lett. \n1988, 29(48), 6331-6334) followed by hydrolysis in aqueous acid provides aldehydes of formula (10-4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (10-3) can be prepared from either compounds of formula (2-4) or compounds of formula (10-4). Aldehydes of formula (10-4) can be reacted with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride to supply the corresponding alcohol. The alcohol can be converted to a leaving group by reaction with a sulfonyl chloride such as p-toluenesulfonyl chloride or methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine to furnish compounds of formula (10-3) wherein the leaving group, LG\n1\n, is a sulfonate. Compounds of formula (2-4) can also be converted to compounds of formula (10-3). In a one-step process, compounds of formula (2-4) can be reacted with a dialkylborane such as disiamylborane or 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9-BBN) in the presence of iodine to give compounds of formula (10-3), wherein LG\n1 \nis iodine. Alternatively, compounds of formula (2-4) can first be converted to the corresponding primary alcohols by hydroboration with a dialkylborane followed by treatment with sodium hydroperoxide. The intermediate alcohols can then be converted to sulfonates of formula (10-3) as previously described giving compounds of formula (10-3), wherein LG\n1 \nis p-toluenesulfonate or methanesulfonate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (10-5) also can be prepared in more than one way. One option is to convert compounds of formula (12-3) to compounds of formula (10-5) by treatment with trimethylsulfonium iodide in the presence of a base such as tert-butoxide in a solvent such as tert-butanol (Boa, A. N.; Canavan, S. P.; et al. \nBioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry \n2005, 13, 1945-1967). As an alternative approach, compounds of formula (2-4) can be converted to the epoxides of formula (10-5) by treatment with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in the presence of a base such as sodium bicarbonate in a mixture of water and dichloromethane (Kamabe, M.; Miyazaki, T.; Hashimoto, K.; Shirahama, H. \nHeterocycles \n2002, 56(1-2), 105-111).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (13-3), wherein a, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare as defined in formulas (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), and (VI), G\n1 \nis defined in the Summary of the Invention, and b represents the bicyclic, tricyclic, or spirocyclic ring systems of compounds of formulas (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), and (VI), can be prepared as described in Scheme 13.

Description\n\n\nTranslated from \nJapanese\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n発明の属する技術分野\n\n本発明は、種々の疾患、特に、ゴーシェ病などの、血漿キトトリオシダーゼ（chitotriosidase）レベルの上昇を特徴とする疾患を治療するための方法及び医薬組成物に関する。\n\n発明の背景\n\n第二メッセンジャーとしてのセラミド\n\n近年、シグナル伝達における第二メッセンジャーとしてのセラミドの重要性が認識されてきている。多くのサイトカインによって生じたシグナルが、この脂質の細胞内濃度の変化を介して伝達されることが明らかになってきた［１，２］。例えば、TNF−α（腫瘍壊死因子α）がその受容体に結合することで生じたシグナルの伝達において、細胞膜の特定領域、或いは（細胞膜内の）陥入部におけるセラミド濃度の局所的な変化が重要である。サイトカインがその受容体に結合すると、スフィンゴミエリナーゼはその触媒作用によりスフィンゴミエリンをホスホリルコリン及びセラミドに変換する。このようにして生成されるセラミドは、特定のタンパク質キナーゼ及びホスファターゼを活性化することによってシグナルを伝達し、細胞応答をもたらす。図１は、TNF−α及び他のサイトカイン（インターフェロンγ及びインターロイキン６など）のシグナル伝達機構の概略を示している。\n\nシグナル伝達におけるセラミドの役割についての、説得力のある実験的な証拠がある。短縮された脂肪族アシル基を有する透過性のセラミドを投与することによって、あるいは、細胞を細菌由来のスフィンゴミエリナーゼで処理することにより細胞表面にセラミドを生成させることによって、TNF−αの効果を実験的に模倣できることが示されている（例えば参考文献2を参照）。\n\n上記のシグナル伝達過程は、おそらくサイトカイン受容体の近辺の、極めて限られた範囲で起こると思われる。細胞膜中のセラミド濃度は、通常の条件下では非常に低いと考えられているが、相当量のセラミドがスフィンゴミエリンの構成単位として細胞膜中に存在している。スフィンゴミエリンが加水分解されると、局所的にセラミド濃度が相当に変化し、その結果シグナルが伝達される。\n\n特定の転移酵素の作用により、セラミドは、ホスファチジルコリン（PC）からのホスホリルコリン部分の転移によってスフィンゴミエリンに再変換されうる。このとき同時にジアシルグリセロールが生じる。ホスファチジルコリンの、ホスホリルコリン及びジアシルグリセロールへの最終的な加水分解をもたらす上記の全経路を、スフィンゴミエリン回路という［２］。\n\nセラミド及びスフィンゴ脂質の代謝\n\n細胞内セラミド濃度の変動が、全てシグナル伝達に影響しているわけではないことは明らかである。セラミドは細胞内で大量に代謝される。この脂質は小胞体膜でアシルCoA及びスフィンゴシンから生合成され、更にゴルジ装置のレベルでスフィンゴミエリン、グルコシルセラミド及びこれに関連する複合体であるガングリオシドに、或いはガラクトシルセラミド及びこれに関連するグロボシドやスルファチドに変換される。スフィンゴミエリン及びグリコスフィンゴ脂質はまた、異化されてセラミド等の、細胞のリソソーム画分の構成成分になる。リソソームで生成されたセラミドは、リソソームのセラミダーゼの作用により局所的に加水分解されてスフィンゴシン及び脂肪酸になり、あるいは細胞質に輸送されてスフィンゴ脂質の生合成に再利用される。セラミド代謝の該略図を図２に示す。\n\nスフィンゴリピドーシス： ゴーシェ病\n\nヒトでは、リソソームのスフィンゴ脂質の異化作用に関する多くの遺伝性疾患、いわゆるスフィンゴリピドーシスが発生する（表１参照）。例えば、リソソームのスフィンゴミエリナーゼの遺伝的欠損は、ニーマン・ピック病の原因となり、リソソームのセラミダーゼ活性が欠損していると、ファーバー病の原因となる。最も頻繁にみられるスフィンゴリピドーシスは、ゴーシェ病である［３］。代謝に関連するこの疾患の原因は、リソソームのβ−グルコシダーゼ、即ちグルコセレブロシダーゼ（E.C.3.2.1.45）の欠損である。この酵素は、グルコシルセラミド（グルコセレブロシド）の加水分解を触媒し、グルコースとセラミドに変換する。ゴーシェ病の患者では、グルコシルセラミドが細管状の構造物として、特にマクロファージのリソソームに蓄積する。脂質が蓄積したマクロファージは特徴的な形態を示し、通常‘ゴーシェ細胞’と呼ばれている。ゴーシェ病の臨床的発現過程の中で、異常なマクロファージが、骨髄、脾臓、肝臓、腎臓及び肺などの身体の各部に大量に蓄積する。ゴーシェ病に関する最も著明な臨床的徴候は、進行性の脾腫、肝腫及び骨格の劣化（skeletal deterioration）である。多くの場合、ゴーシェ病患者には、神経性の合併症は見られない。通常見られる神経障害を伴わないゴーシェ病は、タイプ１ゴーシェ病と呼ばれている。極めて重篤なゴーシェ病の場合には、特徴的な神経学的異常が生じ、乳幼児期（タイプ２）あるいは少年期（タイプ３）に致死的な合併症を引き起こす［３］。\n\nゴーシェ細胞\n\nグルコシルセラミドが蓄積したゴーシェ細胞は、病体生理学上重要な役割を果たしていると考えられている。身体の各部にゴーシェ細胞が大量に蓄積すると、局所的な病状をもたらすと考えられている。\n\nゴーシェ細胞を、単にグリコスフィンゴ脂質を容器の如く貯蔵しているだけの細胞と考えるべきではない。この貯蔵細胞は実際、活性化されたマクロファージであって、加水分解酵素及びサイトカインなどの特定のタンパク質を大量に分泌している。これらの因子はその後病原性因子として作用し、局所的な組織障害や代謝回転（turnover）を引き起こす。その上、サイトカインなどのゴーシェ細胞由来の因子は、付加的な活性化マクロファージの漸増（recruitment）を促進する（図3の概略図を参照）。\n\n近年本発明者らは、ゴーシェ細胞に対する高感度なマーカーを見出した［4］。また本発明者らは、in situハイブリッド形成法（in situ hybridization）の技術を使って、ゴーシェ細胞が、分泌酵素であって、様々な種に存在するキチナーゼのヒトにおける類似体であるキトトリオシダーゼを大量に生合成していることを観察した。このことにより、臨床的な症状を呈しているゴーシェ病患者における、血漿キトトリオシダーゼレベルの劇的な上昇が説明される。このような患者の血漿キトトリオシダーゼレベルは、平均すると健常者に比べ約1,000倍高い。これに対し前症候性あるいは無症候性の遺伝的グルコセレブロシダーゼ欠損者では、血漿キトトリオシダーゼレベルが（ほぼ）通常の範囲内にある（表２参照）。血漿キトトリオシダーゼレベルの上昇が、他のスフィンゴリピドーシス、特にニーマン−ピック病の患者においても着目されてきていることは興味深い［５］。\n\n末梢血単球由来の培養マクロファージにおいては、グルコシルセラミドの濃度が徐々に上昇することが観察される。グルコセレブロシダーゼの強力な非可逆的阻害剤であるコンズリット B−エポキシド（conduritol B-epoxide）の存在下で細胞を増殖させると、糖脂質濃度の上昇はより著明である。上記のマクロファージは、培養開始後約７日でキトトリオシダーゼｍRNAの合成を開始し、酵素を分泌する［４，６］。その結果、キトトリオシダーゼ遺伝子の発現は劇的に上昇する。約３週間後には、キトトリオシダーゼは生合成された全タンパク質の約１％に達する［７］。このことは放射能標識したメチオニンの取込み実験から明らかとなる。培養液中にグルコシルセラミド又はコンズリット B−エポキシド（リソソームのグルコセレブロシダーゼの非可逆的阻害剤）が継続的に存在していると、キトトリオシダーゼの発現が促進される。\n\nゴーシェ病に対する治療的介入\n\nゴーシェ病における病状の進行（natural history）についての情報は乏しく、また個々の症例に基づくものしかないが、それらによればゴーシェ病の臨床的症状は進行性であるが、発病は通常徐々に起こるのではない。殆どの患者において、特定の年齢に達すると特定の組織において急速に異常が起こるが、その後かなり長期にわたって症状が安定化することがある。そしてその後、病状は再度急速に進行する。言い換えれば、この疾患は局所的に進行するが、その進行の仕方は一定ではない（chaotic）。ゴーシェ細胞は、おそらくこうした局所的な発病過程において重大な役割を果たしていると考えられる。活性化貯蔵細胞が存在すると、局所的な組織障害や代謝回転を誘導し、またそのような場所での活性化マクロファージの漸増を促進して、病理学的事象のカスケードを開始させる（図３参照）が、その進行の仕方は一定でない。この概念によれば、病理学的カスケードを破壊又は阻害することによって、主たる有益な効果が発揮されることになる。ゴーシェ病の治療に対する、これまでに検討されてきた種々のアプローチ方法について以下に述べる。\n\n酵素補充療法\n\n３０年以上にわたり、治療上の１つの選択肢として、ゴーシェ病患者のマクロファージへのヒトグルコセレブロシダーゼの補充が真剣に検討されてきた。しかし、ゴーシェ病の治療法を開発するための努力がなされたにもかかわらず、十分量の純粋なヒトグルコセレブロシダーゼを入手することが不可能であったり、組織内マクロファージのリソソームに静脈内投与した酵素を選択的に取り込ませることが困難であったため、この方法は長年の間殆ど不成功に終わっていた。１９９０年以降にようやく、ヒトグルコセレブロシダーゼを長期にわたり患者に補充することによる、ゴーシェ病に対する効果的な治療的介入が可能にになった［８］。静脈内注入によって投与されるのは、N結合型グリカンを修飾し、マンノース残基が末端に存在するようにしたヒトグルコセレブロシダーゼである。上記の修飾はマンノース受容体を介した取込みに好都合である。修飾された［「マンノース末端化（mannose-terminated）」］酵素の、組織マクロファージのリソソームへの取込みは、マンノース受容体が介在するエンドサイトーシスによって起こるため、取り込みの選択性が改善される。現在、全投与量（月に１５−２４０Ｕ／ｋｇ体重）及び投与頻度（１−２週間に３回）が異なる種々の投与法が用いられている（例えば参考文献９参照）。ヒト胎盤から単離されたグルコセレブロシダーゼ（セレダーゼ；アルグルセラーゼ）及びCHO細胞内で組換えにより生成された酵素（セレザイム；イミグルセラーゼ）は、ゴーシェ病に関連する臨床的徴候を幾分好転させる作用があり、その有効性は同等であることが見出されている［１０］。\n\n酵素補充療法の著しく有益な効果としては、肺や脾臓の体積の減少であり、又、ヘモグロブリン濃度、血小板数、白血球数などの血液学的パラメータの改善がある。ただし、同じ投与法で処置を受けた患者の間であっても、臨床的な反応の速さや強さに著しい個人差がある［９］。一般的には、生化学的な血清異常の著明な改善を伴って、処置後１年以内に最も著しい臨床的症状の改善が起こる。しかし酵素補充療法では、たとえ長年多量のグルコセレブロシダーゼ投与を受けている患者の場合でも、臨床的徴候の完全な好転や、血清異常、例えばアンギオテンシン変換酵素、酒石酸エステル耐性酸性ホスファターゼ及びキトトリオシダーゼのレベルの上昇などの完全な正常化は達成されない［１１］。酵素補充療法において症状が部分的にしか改善されないことは、骨髄移植が成功した患者においては症状の完全な改善が認められることと対照的である。\n\n酵素補充療法における適切な投与法については、矛盾する見解が依然として存在している。血液学的な改善に関しては、酵素の投与量を低くする投与法と、酵素を多量に投与する投与法とでは効果が（ほぼ）同等であるのに対し、骨疾患への介入においては、適切とされる投与法は依然として疑わしいものである。\n\n現在、１，５００人以上の患者が酵素補充療法を受けている。この治療法を受ける患者の近年の増加は、科学的な関心と共に一般からも相当に関心を持たれるようになったが、これはこの治療法が高い費用を要し、且つ潜在的な危険性を有するためでもある。これまでのところ、治療の結果が好ましいものであった場合、その費用が例外的に高額（患者一人当たり、年に１００，０００−４００，０００ドル）であるため、ゴーシェ病の酵素補充療法は他のあらゆる病気の薬物治療よりも高くつく、最も高価な薬物治療であるという確信をもたらした。また、アルグルセラーゼ製剤は微量のHCG及びその他の不純物を含有することが知られているが、これまでの例では、酵素補充療法は安全であることが示されている。\n\nゴーシェ病に対する酵素補充療法は、将来の他の希な遺伝性疾患に対する治療法の開発のためのモデルケースとなると考えられている。このことは、１９９５年２−３月にかけて、技術評価会議（Technology Assessment Conference）が国立衛生研究所（ベセスダ、USA）内に組織され、この会議がゴーシェ病を専門的に取り扱うものであったことによって最もよく説明される。この種の会議は、例外的に急を要する必要なヘルスケアがあるときのみ組織されるものである。会議運営の間、１２人の専門家からなる調査団は、ゴーシェ病の分野で指導的な立場にある科学者及び臨床医から証言を集め、ゴーシェ病に関する多くの臨床的徴候を好転させる上で、酵素補充療法が効果的であると結論した。さらに、ヒトタンパク質補充療法の費用及びこの治療法に伴う潜在的な危険性を減少させることが、患者のケア及びヘルスケアにおける経済性という点から重大な問題であると強調された［１２］。\n\nその他の治療方法\n\n限られた人数の少年期の患者において、骨髄移植によるゴーシェ病の治療が成功している。血液幹細胞にグルコセレブロシダーゼの正常な遺伝情報を導入すると、正常速度でグルコシルセラミドを加水分解できる血液細胞が形成されるようになる。骨髄移植の成功に伴ってゴーシェ病患者から臨床的な症状が消失するという事実は、血液細胞のグルコセレブロシダーゼ活性が正常であれば、疾患の症状が現れないことを示している。残念ながら、型が適合するドナーから骨髄を入手できる可能性が限られている上、このような介入に伴い患者が相当に病的な状態となるため、ゴーシェ病に対する治療法として骨髄移植を適応できる可能性は、特に患者が成人の場合非常に限定されている。\n\n近年、ゴーシェ病治療のための選択肢としての遺伝子治療が集中的に研究されている。一般的に、以下の方法が構想されている。多能性血液幹細胞を単離し、ヒトグルコセレブロシダーゼｃDNAを有するベクターを形質導入する。形質導入が成功した後、上記の幹細胞を患者に再導入する。動物実験によって得られたデータは、遺伝子治療がゴーシェ病の治療法として有望であることを示唆しているが、この方法による効率的な介入を期待する前に、多くの重大な問題が解決されなければならない。最大の不利益な点は、「遺伝的に矯正された」幹細胞及びそれらの子孫細胞は、おそらくそれらが選別される上で有利ではないということである。したがって、遺伝子治療を効果的に行なうためには、矯正されている多能性幹細胞がその大半を占める状態が安定に保たれなければならないと想定される。遺伝子治療に関する技術の現状に対する評価については参考文献１３を参照されたい。\n\nゴーシェ病の治療法におけるもう一つのアプローチ方法として、いわゆる「基質剥奪療法（substrate deprivation therapy）」が提案されている［１４−１６］。生合成されるグルコシルセラミドの量を大幅に減少させると、マクロファージによって分解されるグルコシルセラミドの量も減少するので、有益な効果が得られると論議されている。グルコシルセラミド合成酵素の数種類の阻害剤が開発されている。例えば、１−フェニル−デカノイルアミノ−３−モルフォリノ−１−プロパノール（PDMP）、及び、その類似体である１−フェニル−２−ヘキサデカノイルアミノ−３−モルフォリノ−１−プロパノール（PPMP）［１４］、ブチル−デオキシノジリマイシン［１５］及びブチル−デオキシガラクトノジリマイシン［１６］などがある。\n\n「基質の剥奪」というアプローチ方法における不利益な点としては、グリコシルセラミドの生合成だけでなく、より複雑なグリコスフィンゴ脂質の生合成までもが阻害されることである。その上、現在入手可能なグルコシルセラミド合成酵素阻害剤は、多くの重要な生化学的効果を示すことが知られており、このためこれらの阻害剤が治療薬として適用される可能性は限られたものとなるかも知れない。例えば、PDMPは、ある種の細胞にアポトーシスを誘導することが知られている。ブチル−デオキシノジリマイシンは、リソソームのグルコセレブロシダーゼ及びａ−グルコシダーゼＩを阻害することが知られており、ａ−グルコシダーゼＩは、小胞体（ＥＲ）に存在する酵素であって、新たに生成された糖タンパク質やこの酵素自体のＮ結合型グリカンの修飾において重大な役割を果たし、タンパク質の折りたたまれ方の状態を調節する。ブチル−デオキシノジリマイシンの抗ウイルス作用は、糖タンパク質の修飾に対する阻害作用によって引き起こされると考えられている。その上近年、グルコシルセラミド合成酵素阻害剤は、同酵素の生合成を誘導することが報告されている。したがって、これらの阻害剤の投与を中止すると、グルコシルセラミド合成酵素の活性が異常に高レベルになり、グルコシルセラミドの負荷を増加させるので、ゴーシェ病患者に対するこれらの阻害剤の投与を長期にわたって継続する必要がある［１４］。\n\n発明の概要\n\n本発明は、スペーサーを介してデオキシノジリマイシンの窒素原子に結合した大きな疎水性部分を含有していることを特徴とする、デオキシノジリマイシン誘導体またはその塩を提供する。（以下、「デオキシノジリマイシン誘導体またはその塩」を単に「デオキシノジリマイシン誘導体」と言う。）\n\n本発明において用いられる「スペーサー」とは、疎水性の基をデオキシノジリマイシンの窒素原子に結合しうる２価の部分又は基であれば特に限定されない。スペーサーは、好ましくは３から８個の炭素原子からなるポリアルキレン鎖、より好ましくは３から６個の炭素原子からなるポリアルキレン鎖、最も好ましくは５個の炭素原子からなるポリアルキレン鎖である。本発明の特に好ましい態様において、スペーサーは、―（ＣＨ\n2\n）\nn\n―で表される構造を有し、上記構造中のｎが３〜８、好ましくは３〜６、より好ましくは５である。\n\n本発明において用いられる「大きな疎水性部分」とは、脂質親和性の性質を有し、生体の脂質二重層膜に安定に入り込むことができる疎水性の部分又は基であれば特に限定されない。通常、この疎水性部分は、飽和、不飽和、及び部分的に不飽和の環状構造からなる群より選ばれる少なくとも一つの環状構造、特に２つ以上の縮合環からなる縮合環構造を包含するものが好ましい。特に好ましい大きな疎水性部分は、２つ以上の炭素原子を他の環と共有する環を３つ以上包含する多環式アルコールより誘導されたものである。この様な大きな疎水性部分は、脂質二重層膜に入り込むことができる。\n\n大きな疎水性部分は、好ましくはアダマンタンメタノール（adamantanemethanol）、コレステロール、β−コレスタノール、アダマンタノール（adamanthanol）、及び９−フェナントロール（9-hydroxyphenanthrene）からなる群より選ばれる化合物から誘導されたものである。\n\n更に本発明は、デオキシノジリマイシン誘導体またはその塩を含有する医薬組成物、及びいくつかの治療用途を含む、デオキシノジリマイシン誘導体の様々な用途を提供する。\n\n【図面の簡単な説明】\n\n図１は、セラミドを介したシグナル伝達系の概略図である。ＴＮＦ−α（腫瘍壊死因子−α、tumor necrosis factor alfa）、ＩＬ−１（インターロイキン１、interleukin 1）、ＮＧＦ（神経増殖因子、nerve growth factor）、ＩＦＮ（インターフェロンγ、interferon gamma）がそれぞれのレセプターと結合すると、中性スフィンゴミエリナーゼ（neutral sphingomyelinase）の作用によりスフィンゴミエリンからセラミドが生成する。セラミドはタンパク質キナーゼ及びをホスファターゼを活性化し、その結果として細胞応答が生じる。\n\n図２は、セラミドの代謝の概略図である。図中の略語は、Chol＝コリン；Glc＝グルコース；GlcCer＝グルコシルセラミド；GSL＝複合グリコスフィンゴ脂質；LacCer＝ラクトシルセラミド；SM＝スフィンゴミエリンである。\n\n図３は、ゴーシェ病の病体生理学を示す図である。脂質を過剰に蓄積したマクロファージ（即ち、「ゴーシェ細胞」）は、加水分解酵素を分泌して組織障害と代謝回転を引き起し、またサイトカインを分泌してマクロファージの漸増を促進し、結果として病理カスケードを作動させる。\n\n図４は、ゴーシェ病の病因と、治療目的で病理カスケードに介入するための標的を示す仮想モデルである。リソソームのＧＣ（グルコシルセラミド）異化作用障害によって、非リソソーム性グルコシルセラミダーゼ活性が増加する。その結果、セラミド（Ｃ）の生成が増加し、セラミドが関連する核へのシグナル伝達も増加する。次に、病理カスケードの作動を促進する特定の因子が生成・分泌される。\n\nグルコシルセラミダーゼ活性を特異的に阻害することにより、ゴーシェ病の病因となるメカニズムに容易に介入することができると考えられる。\n\n発明の詳細な説明\n\n\n新規な治療方法：マクロファージの活性化の阻害\n \n\n現在用いられている酵素療法には多大な費用が必要であり、この療法の効果は個人によって非常にばらつくことが証明されている。酵素療法の代わりとなるその他の治療方法は、限定された患者のみにしか適用できない（骨髄移植）か、または効果や安全性が立証されていない（遺伝子治療や基質剥奪療法）。この様な状況で、本発明者らは、酵素療法に加えて用いられうる新規な治療方法について鋭意研究を行った。\n\n本発明者らの考えるゴーシェ病の病因（図３を参照）によると、加水分解酵素及びサイトカインの放出を引き起こすマクロファージの活性化こそが、介入のための理想的な標的である。\n\nゴーシェ細胞の活性化を防ぐことが可能な薬剤は治療剤として有用であり、更にこの様な薬剤は、酵素治療の効果を増大させるとも考えられる。\n\n\nマクロファージの活性化阻害に基づく介入方法の開発\n \n\n\n介入のための標的の同定\n \n\n目的とする治療剤を開発するために、初めに、ゴーシェ細胞がその特徴的な活性化状態に至るメカニズムを解明した。\n\n本発明者らは、目的とする薬剤の開発を可能にした２つの重要な事柄を研究の過程で発見した。\n\n初めに、ゴーシェ細胞の特徴的な活性化状態を検出するための高感度マーカー、即ち、ゴーシェ細胞による多量のキトトリオシダーゼの合成及び分泌（上記を参照）を見出した。培養液中のマクロファージによるキトトリオシダーゼの生成・分泌が、どれだけ薬剤によって阻害されるかを分析することによって、疾患に関連したマクロファージの活性化を防止すると予想される薬剤の効果を精密に試験することが可能であるという点が重要である。\n\n次に本発明者らは、リソソームのグルコセレブロシダーゼ以外にも、グルコシルセラミドをグルコースとセラミドに加水分解しうる別の酵素がヒト細胞中に存在することを見出した（参考文献１７）。\n\n\n非リソソーム性グルコシルセラミダーゼ\n \n\nこのグルコシルセラミダーゼは、リソソームのグルコセレブロシダーゼとは色々な点で異なる酵素である。この酵素は、グルコセレブロシダーゼとは異なり、リソソームには存在しない。また、グルコセレブロシダーゼとは異なり、ゴーシェ病患者においても欠損は認められない。更に、この酵素は、膜関連タンパク質としての性質を有するグルコセレブロシダーゼとは異なり、膜内在性タンパク質である。そして、人工基質、阻害剤、賦活剤に対して、グルコセレブロシダーゼとは異なる特異性を示す。例えば、グルコセレブロシダーゼとは異なり、グルコシルセラミダーゼはｂ-キシロシド系の人工基質（artificial b-xylosidic substrate）の加水分解を行わない。また、グルコセレブロシダーゼはコンズリットＢ−エポキシド（conduritol B-epoxide）で不可逆的に阻害されるが、グルコシルセラミダーゼはこの物質に対して感受性がない。更に、リソソーム由来の活性化タンパク質であるサポシンＣは、グルコセレブロシダーゼに対し強力な活性化作用を示すが、グルコシルセラミダーゼには何ら影響を与えない。\n\nグルコシルセラミダーゼの機能に関する重要な事柄が見出された。比較的新しい細胞内成分の分画方法を用いた結果、グルコシルセラミダーゼは細胞膜又は初期エンドソームに存在することが判明した。即ち、グルコシルセラミダーゼの作用により、細胞膜内、又は細胞膜内の特異的な陥入部位にセラミドが生成する。実際、顕著な量のグルコシルセラミドが細胞膜に存在することが知られている。従って、セラミドを介するシグナル伝達に関与する細胞膜においては、グルコシルセラミダーゼの作用によって、対応するセラミド濃度の変化が生じている可能性がある。\n\n更に、細胞及び組織から調製した細胞膜懸濁液を用いた実験の結果、リソソームのグルコセレブロシダーゼによってグルコシルセラミドから生成されたセラミドは、ほとんどスフィンゴミエリンに変換されないことが認められた。この現象は、グルコシルセラミダーゼによって生じたセラミドが効率よくスフィンゴミエリンに変換されることと非常に対照的である。また、一過性の第２メッセンジャーとして機能する脂質に期待されるように、グルコシルセラミダーゼによって生じたセラミドは、明らかに、同じ細胞膜内で急速に更なる代謝を受ける。\n\n上記の発見に基づき、本発明者らはゴーシェ病において病因となるマクロファージの活性化について、新規なメカニズムを仮定した。このモデル（図４に示した）によると、グルコセレブロシダーゼ欠損者においては、リソソームにグルコシルセラミドの分解能がないため、グルコシルセラミダーゼを有する細胞膜においてこの糖脂質（グルコシルセラミド）の濃度が増加する。従って、そこに存在する糖脂質（グルコシルセラミド）は異常に高い速度で加水分解されセラミドとなる。生じたセラミドは、タンパク質キナーゼやフォスファターゼを活性化し、特徴的なマクロファージの活性化と、それに伴う病原性因子の生成及び放出を引き起こす。上記モデルの実験による証明、即ち、しかるべき反応に基づいて活性化されたグルコシルセラミダーゼが、マクロファージを活性化するという実験結果を下記で説明する。\n\n\n病理カスケードへの介入のための標的としてのグルコシルセラミダーゼ活性\n \n\nグルコシルセラミダーゼは、ゴーシェ病において生じるマクロファージの活性化の防止に利用できる理想的且つ新規な標的である。酵素活性を特異的に阻害することにより、更なる病原性因子放出が防止され、また病理カスケードの破壊が生じ、その結果として治療効果が得られる。この方法と酵素補充療法を合わせて用いることにより、治療効果が著しく向上すると同時に、関連費用の大幅な削減が可能になると考えられる。\n\n\nグルコシルセラミダーゼ活性の特異的阻害剤の設計\n \n\nグルコシルセラミダーゼに適した阻害剤を特定するために、細胞膜懸濁液および細胞そのものに存在するグルコシルセラミダーゼについて注意深い分析を行った。その結果、重要な関連事項が多数判明した。\n\nグルコシルセラミダーゼは細胞膜に強く結びついており、基質であるグルコシルセラミドの加水分解は、基質も細胞膜に挿入された状態で行われる可能性が最も高い。また、グルコシルセラミダーゼが細胞膜（及び陥入した細胞膜）のどこに存在するかを特定することも重要である。\n\n更に、グルコシダーゼの阻害剤として知られる様々な物質［Ｄ−グルコノラクトン（D-gluconolactone）、カスタノスペルミン（castanospermine）、デオキシノジリマイシン（deoxynojirimycin）、及びブチル−デオキシノジリマイシン（butyl-deoxynojirimycin）］のグルコシルセラミダーゼ活性阻害能を検討した。上記物質の中で、効果の期待できる阻害剤はデオキシノジリマイシンとブチル−デオキシノジリマイシンであり、特にブチル−デオキシノジリマイシンは有望であった。しかし、どちらの阻害剤も、試験に用いた他の阻害剤と同様に、特異性に乏しかった。例えば、リソソームのグルコセレブロシダーゼも阻害剤に対して感受性を示すため、既にグルコセレブロシダーゼを欠損しているゴーシェ病患者に投与するにはいずれの阻害剤もあまり有用とは考えられなかった。更に上記阻害剤は、酵素療法に用いられるアルグルセラーゼ（alglucerase）及びイミグルセラーゼ（imiglucerase）を阻害するので、酵素療法を受けている患者に対してはより深刻な問題を引き起こす。\n\nグルコシルセラミダーゼに対するＩＣ\n50\nの濃度のデオキシノジリマイシンとブチル−デオキシノジリマイシン（それぞれ２０と０．３μＭ）の存在下で細胞の培養を行ったところ、顕著なグルコセレブロシダーゼ活性の阻害（それぞれ約２０と１０％）及びグルコシルセラミド合成酵素活性の阻害（それぞれ約３０と２０％）が認められた。この阻害剤について、数種の細胞において同様の濃度範囲でＥＲ（小胞体）のａ−グルコシダーゼＩ活性［末端Ｎ−グリカンの修飾（N-linking glycan trimming）］を阻害するとの報告もある（参考文献１５）。\n\n既知グルコシダーゼ阻害剤が好ましくない結果を示すことから、本発明者らは新規な、より特異性の高いグルコシルセラミダーゼの阻害剤の設計を、グルコシルセラミダーゼの性質に関する確立された情報を利用しながら行った。\n\nその結果、強力且つ特異的なグルコシルセラミダーゼ阻害剤は以下の性質を有することが判明した。\n\n１− デオキシノジリマイシンからなる部分\n\nグルコシルセラミダーゼ酵素活性の確立された、比較的強力な阻害剤。\n\n２− Ｎ−アルキルからなるスペーサー\n\nデオキシノジリマイシンのＮ−アルキル化は、グルコシルセラミダーゼ阻害能を高めることが本発明者らの研究から明らかとなった。\n\n３− スペーサーにカップリングした、脂質二重層膜、好ましくは細胞膜（及び陥入した細胞膜）に入り込むことができる大きな疎水性部分\n\nグルコシルセラミダーゼを含有する膜に阻害剤が挿入されると、阻害剤のin vivoでの阻害能及び特異性が向上する。\n\n\nデオキシノジリマイシン−アナログの合成\n \n\n本発明者らの考えを検討し、且つ理想的なグルコシルセラミダーゼ阻害剤を開発するために、一連のデオキシノジリマイシン誘導体の化学合成を行った。上記の考えに基づき、以下に示すような一連のデオキシノジリマイシン（ＤＮＭ）誘導体を合成した（式１）：\n\n\n\n上記の構造において、Ｘは飽和アルカン鎖であり、Ｒは大きな無極性基である。この様な化合物は、市販のテトラベンジルグルコピラノース（tertabenzyl-glucopyranose）から７段階の反応で得られるデオキシノジリマイシン塩酸塩（ＤＮＭ・ＨＣｌ）（参考文献１８）と、適切なアルデヒドとの還元的アミノ化（参考文献１９）反応によって得られる化合物である（スキーム１）。\n\n\n\n合成方法を以下の２種の化合物、Ｎ−（５−コレステロールオキシペンチル）−デオキシノジリマイシン［N-（5-cholesteroloxy-pentyl）-deoxynojirimycin］（化合物９）及びＮ−（５−アダマンタン−１−イル−メトキシペンチル）−デオキシノジリマイシン［N-（5-adamantane-1-yl-methoxy-pentyl）-deoxynojirimycin］（化合物１０）について例示する（スキーム２）。具体的には、まずグルタルアルデヒド（化合物１）を、イオン交換樹脂を触媒として用い、モノアセタール（化合物２）に転換した（参考文献２０）。得られたモノアセタールの、対応するアルコール（化合物３）への還元と、メシラート（mesylate）（化合物４）への変換を行った後、塩基性の条件下で、適切なアルコール（ＲＯＨは、それぞれコレステロール又はアダマンタンメタノールである）と反応させて、アセタールである化合物５と６を得た。脱保護により第二の遊離アルデヒド基を形成（即ち、化合物７及び８の生成）した後、得られた化合物とデオキシノジリマイシン塩酸塩との還元的アミノ化反応を行い、目的とする化合物９及び１０を得た。\n\n\n\n\nデオキシノジリマイシン−アナログの阻害効果の定量\n \n\n様々なデオキシノジリマイシン−アナログが関連酵素に与える阻害効果を、in vitroおよび細胞を用いた実験系で分析した。\n\n\nin vitro（試験管内）の実験\n \n\n初めに、精製したヒト由来の酵素とヒト組織より得られた細胞膜懸濁液を用いたin vitroの実験を行った。実験はリソソーム由来のグルコセレブロシダーゼとグルコシルセラミダーゼ活性の阻害、及びリソソーム由来のａ−グルコシダーセ活性の阻害に着目して行われた。グルコシルセラミダーゼとしては、ヒト脾臓より得られた膜画分を用いた。グルコシルセラミダーゼ活性は、グルコセレブロシダーゼの活性を消すためにコンズリットＢ−エポキシドによる前処理を行った膜画分を用い、４ＭＵ−ｂ−グルコシド（4MU-b-glucoside）の加水分解能として測定した。グルコセレブロシダーゼとしては、酵素療法に用いられるヒト胎盤酵素［セレダーゼ（ceredase），米国（ボストン）、Genezyme Corp社製］、または、ヒト脾臓より得られた膜画分を用いた。グルコセレブロシダーゼの活性は、コンズリットＢ−エポキシドによって阻害可能な、４ＭＵ−ｂ−グルコシドの加水分解能として測定した。リソソーム由来のａ−グルコシダーゼの活性は、精製したａ−グルコシダーゼ調製液による４ＭＵ−ｂ−グルコシドの加水分解能として測定した。\n\n表６及び表７に試験に用いた化合物の構造を示す。表３には、測定によって得られた阻害剤のＫｉを示す。\n\n表３より明らかなように、グルコシルセラミダーゼはデオキシノジリマイシンのＮ−アルキル誘導体によって強く阻害される。至適阻害活性はＮ−ペンチル誘導体に見られた。Ｎ−ヘキシル−デオキシノジリマイシン（N-hexyl-deoxynojirimycin）の効果は若干劣っていた（表３に示していない）。また、スペーサーにカルボニル基が存在すると、阻害能に好ましくない影響を与える。\n\n大きな疎水性の基、例えばアダマンタン（Ｐ２１）やコレステロール（Ｐ２４）を、Ｎ−ペンチルからなるスペーサーとカップリングすると、化合物のグルコシルセラミダーセ活性阻害能が劇的に向上する。\n\nいくつかの阻害剤について、そのＩＣ\n50\nも測定した。Ｐ２１とＰ２４の、見かけのＩＣ\n50\nは非常に低く、それぞれ１ｎＭと０．１μＭであった。比較のために測定したデオキシノジリマイシンとブチル−デオキシノジリマイシンのＩＣ\n50\nは、それぞれ２０μＭと０．３μＭであった。\n\n表３は、一般にグルコセレブロシダーゼの方が、グルコシルセラミダーゼに比べて阻害剤に対する感受性が若干低いことを示す。\n\n溶液中の純粋なグルコセレブロシダーゼ（セレダーゼ）と膜に結び付いた酵素は、阻害剤に対して異なる感受性を示す。４ＭＵ−ｂ−グルコシドに対して測定されたＫｍ値が異なることから、２つの異なる状態にある酵素は、反応速度的な性質が異なることが示唆された。\n\n溶解性のグルコセレブロシダーゼも、膜に結び付いたグルコセレブロシダーゼも、共にＮ−ペンチルからなるスペーサーを介してカップリングした大きな疎水性部分を含有するデオキシノジリマイシン−アナログによって最も強く阻害される。\n\n溶解性のグルコセレブロシダーゼ（セレダーゼ）における見かけのＩＣ\n50\nは、Ｐ２１で０．２μＭであり、Ｐ２４で０．８μＭであった。膜に結び付いたグルコセレブロシダーゼにおける見かけのＩＣ\n50\nは、Ｐ２１とＰ２４でそれぞれ０．０６μＭ及び０．７μＭであった。\n\nリソソーム由来のａ−グルコシダーゼに関しては、デオキシノジリマイシン中の一部を置換しても、全体的にほとんど阻害能の変化を生じなかった。しかし、Ｐ４，Ｐ１１，Ｐ１６，Ｐ９とＰ１３は非常に弱い阻害剤であった。\n\n\nin vivo（生体内）の実験\n \n\n次に、細胞そのものが有するグルコシルセラミダーゼ活性及びグルコセレブロシダーゼ活性に対する、デオキシノジリマイシン−アナログの活性阻害能について検討した。酵素活性の測定は参考文献１７の方法に従って行った。実験には、コンズリットＢ−エポキシドの存在下または非存在下で事前に培養しておいた培養メラノーマ細胞を用い、メラノーマ細胞による４ＭＵ−ｂ−グルコシドの加水分解を測定した。コンズリットＢ−エポキシド感受性の活性はグルコシルセラミダーゼ活性であり、コンズリットＢ−エポキシド非感受性の活性はグルコセレブロシダーゼ活性である。この実験の結果を表４に示す。\n\n表３と表４の比較から、メラノーマ細胞そのものにおける、デオキシノジリマイシン−アナログによるグルコシルセラミダーゼ活性の阻害は、脾臓の細胞膜調製液を用いたin vitroの実験と同様の結果であることが示された。実験に用いたアナログのうち、最も有効な阻害剤はＰ２１及びＰ２４であり、ＩＣ\n50\nの値はそれぞれ約０．３ｎＭ及び５０ｎＭであった。上記阻害剤は、ＩＣ\n50\nの値及びその１０倍の濃度においても、顕著なグルコセレブロシダーゼ活性の阻害は検出されなかった（表４を参照）。\n\nまた、デオキシノジリマイシン−アナログの阻害定数を、メラノーマ細胞によるＣ６−ＮＢＤグルコシルセラミド（C6−NBD glucosylceramide）の代謝を用いて決定した。この実験においてもコンズリットＢ−エポキシドを用い、この化合物に対して非感受性のグルコシルセラミダーゼ活性と感受性のグルコセレブロシダーゼ活性を区別した。C6−NBDグルコシルセラミドを基質として用いた実験の結果は、蛍光ラベルした４ＭＵ−ｂ−グルコシドを基質として用いた実験とほぼ同一であった（結果は示していない）。\n\n他の反応がどの程度デオキシノジリマイシンのアナログによって阻害されるかを検討するために、グルコシルセラミダーゼ活性に対してＩＣ\n50\nとなる濃度のＰ２１とＰ２４をそれぞれ用いて細胞を培養した。この様な培養条件において、ラット肝細胞のグリコーゲン合成酵素、及び培養メラノーマ細胞のグルコシルセラミド合成酵素及びリソソーム由来のa−グルコシダーゼの活性に対する阻害は見られなかった。\n\nグルコシルセラミダーゼがＰ２１に対して非常に高い感受性を示すことから、次に、この阻害反応が不可逆反応であるかどうかを検討した。実験を行うために、培養ミエローマ細胞をＰ２１の存在下及び非存在下で事前に培養し、続いて細胞を充分に洗浄した。次に、得られた細胞を用い、４ＭＵ−ｂ−グルコシドを基質として用いたグルコセレブロシダーゼ及びグルコシルセラミダーゼの活性をそれぞれ測定した。その結果、阻害剤による前処理はグルコセレブロシダーゼ活性に対しては顕著な効果を示さなかったが、グルコシルセラミダーゼ活性の不可逆的な損失を引き起こした。\n\n\n本発明の効果の証明：マクロファージの活性化に介入する物質としてのデオキシノジリマイシン−アナログの効果\n \n\nＰ２１（Ｎ−（５−アダマンタン−１−イル−メトキシペンチル）−デオキシノジリマイシン）［N-（5-adamantane-1-yl-methoxy-pentyl）deoxynojirimycin］とブチル−デオキシノジリマイシンの培養マクロファージに与える影響に付いて検討した。ＤＭＳＯ中に溶解した１０ｍＭのイミノ糖類を、いろいろな希釈度でマクロファージの培養液に添加した。上記の方法で培養液に混入した微量のＤＭＳＯは実験結果に影響を与えないことも確認した。\n\n表５に、Ｃ６−ＮＢＤグルコシルセラミドを基質として用いた、マクロファージにおけるデオキシノジリマイシン−アナログによるグルコセレブロシダーゼ活性及びグルコシルセラミダーゼ活性の阻害結果を示す。デオキシノジリマイシン−アナログのマクロファージに対する効果は、ミエローマ細胞における酵素活性阻害と同様であった。更に表５に、デオキシノジリマイシン−アナログの細胞によるキトトリオシダーゼの分泌に対する影響も示す。表５から明らかなように、キトトリオシダーゼの分泌はグルコシルセラミダーゼ活性の阻害に伴って減少するが、リソソームのグルコセレブロシダーゼ活性とは関連が無い。更に、Ｃ６−ＮＢＤグルコシルセラミドを基質として用いた、マクロファージのグルコシルセラミド合成酵素活性も測定した。その結果、この酵素活性は、キトトリオシダーゼの分泌を減少させる５μＭのブチルデオキシノジリマイシンが培養液に存在しても顕著な阻害は受けないことが明らかとなった。更に、グルコシルセラミド合成酵素を阻害するＰＤＭＰ及びＰＰＭＰの存在は、キトトリオシダーゼの分泌には影響しないことが判明した。\n\n結論として、上記の実験により、低濃度のブチルデオキシノジリマイシン及び特にＰ２１は、そのグルコシルセラミダーゼに対する特異的な阻害能によって、大量にキトトリオシダーゼを（その他の加水分解酵素及びサイトカインと共に）分泌するマクロファージを不活性化することが示された。従って、本発明の効果は実験的に証明された。\n\n\nグルコシルセラミダーゼ活性阻害剤の用途\n \n\n新規に開発された非常に高い特異性を示す阻害剤の１つの用途として、ゴーシェ病に対する治療的介入を挙げることができる。上記したように、マクロファージの活性化に対する阻害剤の効果は、ゴーシェ病の病因に好ましい影響を与えると考えられる。阻害剤の投与は酵素療法の効率を高めると考えられ、その当然の結果として、臨床効果を向上し、関連費用の削減に繋がる。\n\n細胞質中における高濃度のキトトリオシダーゼによって特徴付けられるその他の疾患、例えば、ニーマン−ピック病やサルコイドーシスに対しても、グルコシルセラミダーゼの阻害剤は好ましい効果を発揮すると考えられる（参考文献４及び５を参照）。更に、アテローマ性動脈硬化症の泡末細胞は、キトトリオシダーゼを過剰に産生していることが知られている。\n\nセラミドを介するシグナル伝達系は、グルコシルセラミダーゼ活性の阻害によって直接又は間接的に影響を受けると考えられる。従って、開発した阻害剤の考えられる用途は非常に広範囲に渡るものであり、特に、セラミドを介したシグナル伝達において、ＴＮＦ−αやその他の前炎症性（proinflammatory）サイトカインが引き起こす炎症性疾患の症状に関連した用途は注目されている。具体的には、敗血病性ショック、慢性関節リウマチおよびクーロン病への応用が例示される。\n\n最適な医薬組成物の投与方法およびその組成は、当業者の通常の知識の範囲内で選択することができる。例えば、本発明に適した投与方法は非経口（静脈、皮下、筋肉）投与である注射や注入、経口投与、及び局所投与である。特に好ましい方法としては、油性の賦形剤を用い、ゆっくりと長期に渡って貯蔵性の製剤より薬剤を放出させるとよい。しかし、経口投与や静脈注射に油性の賦形剤を用いることは困難である。経口投与の場合、消化器系における脂質親和性化合物の吸収は、混合ミセル状態の化合物の溶解と同時に起こり、引き続き、腸の内膜を介した拡散による吸収が起こる。静脈注射の場合は、脂質親和性の化合物を事前に取り込ませておいたリポソームを用いることができる。\n\n実施例\n\n\n５，５−ジエトキシペンタン−１−オール（３）\n

FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention relates to methods and pharmaceutical compositions for treating various diseases, particularly diseases characterized by elevated plasma chitotriosidase levels, such as Gaucher disease.\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\nCeramide as a second messenger\n\nIn recent years, the importance of ceramide as a second messenger in signal transduction has been recognized. It has been shown that signals generated by many cytokines are transmitted through changes in the intracellular concentration of this lipid [1,2]. For example, in signal transduction caused by binding of TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor α) to its receptor, local changes in ceramide concentration in a specific region of the cell membrane or in the invader (in the cell membrane) are important. It is. When cytokines bind to their receptors, sphingomyelinase converts sphingomyelin to phosphorylcholine and ceramide by its catalytic action. The ceramide produced in this way transmits signals by activating specific protein kinases and phosphatases, resulting in a cellular response. FIG. 1 shows an outline of the signal transduction mechanism of TNF-α and other cytokines (such as interferon γ and interleukin 6).\n\nThere is compelling experimental evidence about the role of ceramide in signal transduction. The effect of TNF-α can be achieved by administering permeable ceramides with shortened aliphatic acyl groups or by generating ceramides on the cell surface by treating the cells with bacterial sphingomyelinase. It has been shown that it can be mimicked experimentally (see eg reference 2).\n\nThe signal transduction process described above appears to occur to a very limited extent, probably in the vicinity of the cytokine receptor. The concentration of ceramide in the cell membrane is considered to be very low under normal conditions, but a considerable amount of ceramide is present in the cell membrane as a constituent unit of sphingomyelin. When sphingomyelin is hydrolyzed, the concentration of ceramide locally changes considerably, resulting in signal transmission.\n\nThrough the action of certain transferases, ceramide can be reconverted to sphingomyelin by transfer of the phosphorylcholine moiety from phosphatidylcholine (PC). At the same time, diacylglycerol is formed. The entire pathway described above leading to the final hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to phosphorylcholine and diacylglycerol is called the sphingomyelin cycle [2].\n\nMetabolism of ceramide and sphingolipid\n\nClearly, variations in intracellular ceramide concentration do not all affect signal transduction. Ceramide is metabolized in large amounts in the cell. This lipid is biosynthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane from acyl-CoA and sphingosine, and at the level of the Golgi apparatus to sphingomyelin, glucosylceramide and related gangliosides, or galactosylceramide and related globosides and sulfatides. Is converted to Sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids are also catabolized and become components of the lysosomal fraction of cells, such as ceramide. Ceramide produced in lysosomes is locally hydrolyzed into sphingosine and fatty acids by the action of lysosomal ceramidase, or transported to the cytoplasm and reused for sphingolipid biosynthesis. A schematic representation of ceramide metabolism is shown in FIG.\n\nSphingolipidosis: Gaucher disease\n\nIn humans, many inherited diseases related to catabolism of lysosomal sphingolipids, so-called sphingolipidosis (see Table 1) occur. For example, a genetic deficiency of lysosomal sphingomyelinase causes Niemann-Pick disease, and deficiency in lysosomal ceramidase activity causes Farber disease. The most common sphingolipidosis is Gaucher disease [3]. The cause of this disease related to metabolism is deficiency of lysosomal β-glucosidase, glucocerebrosidase (E.C.3.2.1.45). This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide (glucocerebroside) and converts it into glucose and ceramide. In patients with Gaucher disease, glucosylceramide accumulates as a tubular structure, particularly in the lysosomes of macrophages. Macrophages with accumulated lipids exhibit a characteristic morphology and are usually called 'Gaucher cells'. In the clinical manifestation process of Gaucher disease, abnormal macrophages accumulate in large quantities in various parts of the body such as bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney and lung. The most prominent clinical signs of Gaucher disease are progressive splenomegaly, hepatoma and skeletal deterioration. In many cases, patients with Gaucher disease do not have neurological complications. Gaucher's disease, which is not usually accompanied by neuropathy, is called type 1 Gaucher's disease. In the case of extremely severe Gaucher disease, characteristic neurological abnormalities occur, causing fatal complications in infancy (type 2) or juvenile (type 3) [3].\n\nGaucher cell\n\nGaucher cells accumulated with glucosylceramide are thought to play an important role in pathophysiology. It is believed that the accumulation of large amounts of Gaucher cells in various parts of the body leads to local medical conditions.\n\nGaucher cells should not be considered as cells that simply store glycosphingolipids like containers. The storage cells are actually activated macrophages that secrete large amounts of specific proteins such as hydrolases and cytokines. These factors then act as virulence factors, causing local tissue damage and turnover. Moreover, factors such as cytokines derived from Gaucher cells promote the recruitment of additional activated macrophages (see schematic diagram in FIG. 3).\n\nRecently, the present inventors have found a highly sensitive marker for Gaucher cells [4]. The inventors have also used in situ hybridization techniques to identify chitotriosidase, a Gaucher cell that is a secreted enzyme and is a human analogue of chitinase present in various species. Was observed to be biosynthesized in large quantities. This explains the dramatic increase in plasma chitotriosidase levels in Gaucher patients with clinical symptoms. Such patients have an average plasma chitotriosidase level that is about 1,000 times higher than that of healthy individuals. In contrast, in presyndromic or asymptomatic genetic glucocerebrosidase deficient, plasma chitotriosidase levels are (almost) within the normal range (see Table 2). It is interesting that elevated plasma chitotriosidase levels have been noted in other sphingolipidosis, especially in patients with Niemann-Pick disease [5].\n\nIt is observed that the concentration of glucosylceramide gradually increases in cultured macrophages derived from peripheral blood monocytes. The increase in glycolipid concentration is more pronounced when cells are grown in the presence of conduritol B-epoxide, a potent irreversible inhibitor of glucocerebrosidase. The macrophages start synthesizing chitotriosidase mRNA about 7 days after the start of culture and secrete the enzyme [4, 6]. As a result, the expression of the chitotriosidase gene is dramatically increased. After about 3 weeks, chitotriosidase reaches about 1% of the total protein biosynthesized [7]. This is evident from the uptake experiment of radiolabeled methionine. The presence of glucosylceramide or condurite B-epoxide (an irreversible inhibitor of lysosomal glucocerebrosidase) in the culture medium promotes the expression of chitotriosidase.\n\nTherapeutic intervention for Gaucher disease\n\nInformation about the natural history of Gaucher disease is scarce and only based on individual cases, but according to them, the clinical symptoms of Gaucher disease are progressive, but onset usually occurs gradually Not. In most patients, abnormalities occur rapidly in certain tissues when a certain age is reached, but symptoms may then stabilize for a fairly long time. And then the condition progresses rapidly again. In other words, the disease progresses locally, but the way it progresses is not chaotic. Gaucher cells are likely to play a critical role in these local pathogenic processes. The presence of activated storage cells induces local tissue damage and turnover and promotes the recruitment of activated macrophages at such locations to initiate a cascade of pathological events (see FIG. 3). ) However, the way of progress is not constant. According to this concept, the main beneficial effect is exerted by destroying or inhibiting the pathological cascade. The various approaches that have been examined to date for the treatment of Gaucher's disease are described below.\n\nEnzyme replacement therapy\n\nFor over 30 years, human glucocerebrosidase supplementation into macrophages of Gaucher patients has been seriously studied as a therapeutic option. However, despite efforts to develop a treatment for Gaucher's disease, it is not possible to obtain sufficient amounts of pure human glucocerebrosidase, or intravenous administration to lysosomes in tissue macrophages This method has been almost unsuccessful for many years because it was difficult to selectively incorporate the enzyme. Only after 1990, effective therapeutic intervention for Gaucher disease has become possible by long-term supplementation of patients with human glucocerebrosidase [8]. Administered by intravenous infusion is human glucocerebrosidase modified with N-linked glycans so that the mannose residue is at the end. The above modifications favor the uptake through the mannose receptor. The uptake of modified [“mannose-terminated”] enzymes into lysosomes of tissue macrophages occurs by endocytosis mediated by mannose receptors, thus improving uptake selectivity. Currently, various administration methods with different total dose (15-240 U / kg body weight per month) and administration frequency (3 times 1-2 weeks) are used (see, for example, Reference 9). Glucocerebrosidase (ceredase; arglucerase) isolated from human placenta and recombinantly produced CHO cells (selezyme; imiglucerase) have some effect on the clinical signs associated with Gaucher disease It has been found that their effectiveness is comparable [10].\n\nA markedly beneficial effect of enzyme replacement therapy is a reduction in lung and spleen volume and an improvement in hematological parameters such as hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and white blood cell count. However, even among patients treated with the same regimen, there are significant individual differences in the speed and strength of clinical responses [9]. In general, the most significant improvement in clinical symptoms occurs within one year after treatment, with a marked improvement in biochemical serologic abnormalities. However, enzyme replacement therapy, even in patients who have been on high doses of glucocerebrosidase for many years, is a complete improvement in clinical signs and serum abnormalities such as angiotensin converting enzyme, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and chitotriosidase. Complete normalization such as increased levels is not achieved [11]. The partial improvement of symptoms on enzyme replacement therapy is in contrast to the complete improvement of symptoms in patients with successful bone marrow transplants.\n\nThere is still a conflicting view about the appropriate dosing regimen in enzyme replacement therapy. In terms of hematological improvement, administration methods with low enzyme doses and those with high enzyme doses are (almost) equivalent in effect, but appropriate for bone disease interventions. The dosing regimen is still questionable.\n\nCurrently, more than 1,500 patients are receiving enzyme replacement therapy. The recent increase in the number of patients receiving this therapy has come to be of considerable interest from the general public as well as scientific, but this is an expensive and potentially dangerous risk for this therapy It is also for having. So far, if the outcome of treatment is favorable, the cost is exceptionally high ($ 100,000-400,000 per patient per year), so enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher disease is It has led to the belief that it is the most expensive drug treatment that is more expensive than any other disease treatment. Alglucerase preparations are also known to contain traces of HCG and other impurities, but enzyme replacement therapy has been shown to be safe in previous examples.\n\nEnzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher disease is considered to be a model case for the development of treatments for other rare genetic disorders in the future. This means that from February to March 1995, the Technology Assessment Conference was organized within the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, USA) and this conference was dedicated to Gaucher disease. Is best explained. This type of meeting is organized only when there is an exceptionally urgent need for healthcare. During the conference, a team of 12 experts gathered testimony from scientists and clinicians who are leading positions in the field of Gaucher disease and helped to improve many clinical signs of Gaucher disease. They concluded that enzyme replacement therapy is effective. Furthermore, it has been stressed that reducing the cost of human protein replacement therapy and the potential risks associated with this therapy is a significant problem in terms of patient care and healthcare economics [12].\n\nOther treatment methods\n\nA limited number of adolescent patients have been successfully treated for Gaucher disease by bone marrow transplantation. When normal genetic information of glucocerebrosidase is introduced into blood stem cells, blood cells capable of hydrolyzing glucosylceramide at a normal rate are formed. The fact that clinical symptoms disappear from Gaucher patients with successful bone marrow transplantation indicates that disease symptoms do not appear if blood cells have normal glucocerebrosidase activity. Unfortunately, bone marrow transplantation is indicated as a treatment for Gaucher disease because the availability of bone marrow from a well-matched donor is limited, and patients are considerably morbid with this intervention. The possibilities that can be made are very limited, especially when the patient is an adult.\n\nIn recent years, gene therapy as an option for the treatment of Gaucher disease has been intensively studied. In general, the following method is envisaged. Pluripotent blood stem cells are isolated and transduced with a vector having human glucocerebrosidase cDNA. After successful transduction, the stem cells are reintroduced into the patient. Data obtained from animal experiments suggests that gene therapy is a promising treatment for Gaucher disease, but many significant problems have been resolved before expecting efficient intervention with this method. There must be. The biggest disadvantage is that “genetically corrected” stem cells and their progeny cells are probably not advantageous for their sorting. Therefore, in order to perform gene therapy effectively, it is assumed that the state in which the majority of corrected pluripotent stem cells occupy must be kept stable. See Reference 13 for an assessment of the current state of the art regarding gene therapy.\n\nAs another approach in the treatment of Gaucher disease, so-called “substrate deprivation therapy” has been proposed [14-16]. It has been argued that a significant reduction in the amount of biosynthesized glucosylceramide results in a beneficial effect because the amount of glucosylceramide degraded by macrophages also decreases. Several inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthase have been developed. For example, 1-phenyl-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) and its analogue 1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PPMP) [ 14], butyl-deoxynojirimycin [15] and butyl-deoxygalactonojirimycin [16].\n\nA disadvantage of the “substrate deprivation” approach is that it inhibits not only the biosynthesis of glycosylceramides, but also the more complex biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids. In addition, currently available glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors are known to exhibit many important biochemical effects, which limits the potential for these inhibitors to be applied as therapeutic agents. It may become a thing. For example, PDMP is known to induce apoptosis in certain cells. Butyl-deoxynojirimycin is known to inhibit lysosomal glucocerebrosidase and a-glucosidase I, which is an enzyme present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is newly produced. Plays an important role in the modification of glycoproteins and the N-linked glycans of the enzyme itself, and regulates how proteins are folded. The antiviral effect of butyl-deoxynojirimycin is believed to be caused by an inhibitory effect on glycoprotein modification. Moreover, in recent years, glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors have been reported to induce biosynthesis of the enzyme. Therefore, discontinuing administration of these inhibitors results in abnormally high levels of glucosylceramide synthase activity and increased glucosylceramide loading, so administration of these inhibitors to patients with Gaucher disease continues for long periods There is a need [14].\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\nThe present invention provides a deoxynojirimycin derivative or a salt thereof characterized by containing a large hydrophobic moiety bonded to the nitrogen atom of deoxynojirimycin via a spacer. (Hereinafter, “deoxynojirimycin derivative or salt thereof” is simply referred to as “deoxynojirimycin derivative”.)\n\nThe “spacer” used in the present invention is not particularly limited as long as it is a divalent moiety or group capable of binding a hydrophobic group to the nitrogen atom of deoxynojirimycin. The spacer is preferably a polyalkylene chain consisting of 3 to 8 carbon atoms, more preferably a polyalkylene chain consisting of 3 to 6 carbon atoms, and most preferably a polyalkylene chain consisting of 5 carbon atoms. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the spacer is — (CH\n2\n)\nn\nIn the above structure, n is 3 to 8, preferably 3 to 6, and more preferably 5.\n\nThe “large hydrophobic portion” used in the present invention is not particularly limited as long as it is a hydrophobic portion or group that has a lipophilic property and can stably enter a lipid bilayer membrane of a living body. Usually, the hydrophobic moiety includes at least one cyclic structure selected from the group consisting of saturated, unsaturated, and partially unsaturated cyclic structures, particularly fused ring structures composed of two or more condensed rings. Is preferred. Particularly preferred large hydrophobic moieties are those derived from polycyclic alcohols containing three or more rings that share two or more carbon atoms with other rings. Such large hydrophobic moieties can penetrate the lipid bilayer membrane.\n\nThe large hydrophobic portion is preferably derived from a compound selected from the group consisting of adamantanemethanol, cholesterol, β-cholestanol, adamantanol, and 9-hydroxyphenanthrene. is there.\n\nThe present invention further provides various uses of deoxynojirimycin derivatives, including pharmaceutical compositions containing deoxynojirimycin derivatives or salts thereof, and several therapeutic uses.\n\n[Brief description of the drawings]\n\nFIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a signal transduction system via ceramide. TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor alfa), IL-1 (interleukin 1, interleukin 1), NGF (nerve growth factor), IFN (interferon γ, interferon gamma) When bound to the receptor, ceramide is produced from sphingomyelin by the action of neutral sphingomyelinase. Ceramide activates protein kinases and phosphatases, resulting in a cellular response.\n\nFIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of ceramide metabolism. Abbreviations in the figure are Chol = choline; Glc = glucose; GlcCer = glucosylceramide; GSL = complex glycosphingolipid; LacCer = lactosylceramide; SM = sphingomyelin.\n\nFIG. 3 is a diagram showing the pathophysiology of Gaucher disease. Macrophages that accumulate excessive lipids (ie, “Gaucher cells”) secrete hydrolases to cause tissue damage and turnover, and secrete cytokines to promote macrophage recruitment, resulting in pathology. Activate the cascade.\n\nFIG. 4 is a virtual model showing the etiology of Gaucher disease and the targets for intervening in the pathological cascade for therapeutic purposes. Impaired lysosomal GC (glucosylceramide) catabolism increases non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase activity. As a result, the production of ceramide (C) is increased and the signal transduction to the nucleus to which ceramide is associated is also increased. Next, specific factors that promote the operation of the pathological cascade are generated and secreted.\n\nBy specifically inhibiting the glucosylceramidase activity, it is considered that the mechanism causing the Gaucher disease can be easily intervened.\n\nDetailed Description of the Invention\n\n\nNovel therapy: inhibition of macrophage activation\n \n\nEnzyme therapy currently in use is very expensive and the effectiveness of this therapy has proven to vary widely from individual to individual. Other treatment alternatives to enzyme therapy are only applicable to a limited number of patients (bone marrow transplant) or have not proven to be effective or safe (gene therapy or substrate deprivation therapy). Under such circumstances, the present inventors have conducted intensive research on novel treatment methods that can be used in addition to enzyme therapy.\n\nAccording to the pathogenesis of Gaucher's disease, which we consider (see FIG. 3), macrophage activation that causes the release of hydrolases and cytokines is an ideal target for intervention.\n\nAgents that can prevent Gaucher cell activation are useful as therapeutic agents, and such agents are also believed to increase the effectiveness of enzyme therapy.\n\n\nDevelopment of intervention methods based on inhibition of macrophage activation\n \n\n\nIdentifying targets for intervention\n \n\nIn order to develop a targeted therapeutic agent, we first elucidated the mechanism by which Gaucher cells reach their characteristic activated state.\n\nThe present inventors have discovered two important matters that have made it possible to develop a target drug in the course of research.\n\nFirst, a highly sensitive marker for detecting the characteristic activation state of Gaucher cells was found, namely the synthesis and secretion of large amounts of chitotriosidase by Gaucher cells (see above). Detailed analysis of the effects of drugs expected to prevent disease-related macrophage activation by analyzing how much the drugs inhibit the production and secretion of chitotriosidase by macrophages in culture It is important to be able to do that.\n\nNext, the present inventors have found that, in addition to lysosomal glucocerebrosidase, another enzyme capable of hydrolyzing glucosylceramide into glucose and ceramide exists in human cells (reference document 17).\n\n\nNon-lysosomal glucosylceramidase\n \n\nThis glucosylceramidase is an enzyme that differs in various ways from lysosomal glucocerebrosidase. This enzyme is not present in lysosomes, unlike glucocerebrosidase. Also, unlike glucocerebrosidase, no defects are observed in Gaucher patients. Furthermore, this enzyme is an integral membrane protein, unlike glucocerebrosidase, which has properties as a membrane-related protein. And it shows the specificity different from glucocerebrosidase with respect to an artificial substrate, an inhibitor, and an activator. For example, unlike glucocerebrosidase, glucosylceramidase does not hydrolyze b-xylosidic artificial substrates. Also, glucocerebrosidase is irreversibly inhibited by conduritol B-epoxide, but glucosylceramidase is not sensitive to this substance. Furthermore, saposin C, which is an activation protein derived from lysosome, exhibits a strong activating effect on glucocerebrosidase, but has no effect on glucosylceramidase.\n\nAn important matter regarding the function of glucosylceramidase was found. As a result of using a relatively new method for fractionating intracellular components, it was found that glucosylceramidase is present in the cell membrane or early endosome. That is, ceramide is generated in the cell membrane or a specific invaded site in the cell membrane by the action of glucosylceramidase. In fact, it is known that significant amounts of glucosylceramide are present in the cell membrane. Therefore, in the cell membrane involved in signal transmission through ceramide, there is a possibility that the corresponding ceramide concentration is changed by the action of glucosylceramidase.\n\nFurthermore, as a result of experiments using cell membrane suspensions prepared from cells and tissues, it was confirmed that ceramide produced from glucosylceramide by lysosomal glucocerebrosidase was hardly converted to sphingomyelin. This phenomenon is in sharp contrast to the efficient conversion of ceramide produced by glucosylceramidase to sphingomyelin. Also, as expected for lipids that function as transient second messengers, the ceramide produced by glucosylceramidase clearly undergoes further metabolism within the same cell membrane.\n\nBased on the above findings, the present inventors hypothesized a novel mechanism for macrophage activation that is pathogenic in Gaucher disease. According to this model (shown in FIG. 4), in glucocerebrosidase deficient individuals, the concentration of this glycolipid (glucosylceramide) is increased in the cell membrane having glucosylceramidase because the lysosome has no resolution of glucosylceramide. Therefore, the glycolipid (glucosylceramide) present therein is hydrolyzed to an ceramide at an abnormally high rate. The resulting ceramide activates protein kinases and phosphatases, causing characteristic macrophage activation and the associated generation and release of virulence factors. The proof by experiment of the above model, that is, the experimental result that glucosylceramidase activated based on the appropriate reaction activates macrophages is described below.\n\n\nGlucosylceramidase activity as a target for intervention in pathological cascades\n \n\nGlucosylceramidase is an ideal and novel target that can be used to prevent macrophage activation that occurs in Gaucher disease. By specifically inhibiting the enzyme activity, further virulence factor release is prevented and the pathological cascade is disrupted, resulting in a therapeutic effect. The combined use of this method and enzyme replacement therapy will significantly improve the therapeutic effect while at the same time allowing a significant reduction in associated costs.\n\n\nDesign of specific inhibitors of glucosylceramidase activity\n \n\nIn order to identify suitable inhibitors for glucosylceramidase, careful analysis was performed on glucosylceramidase present in cell membrane suspensions and cells themselves. As a result, many important related matters were found.\n\nGlucosylceramidase is strongly bound to the cell membrane, and hydrolysis of the substrate glucosylceramide is most likely to be carried out with the substrate also inserted into the cell membrane. It is also important to identify where the glucosylceramidase is present in the cell membrane (and the invaded cell membrane).\n\nIn addition, various substances known as inhibitors of glucosidase [D-gluconolactone, castanospermine, deoxynojirimycin, and butyl-deoxynojirimycin] Were investigated for their ability to inhibit glucosylceramidase activity. Among the above substances, inhibitors that can be expected to be effective are deoxynojirimycin and butyl-deoxynojirimycin, and butyl-deoxynojirimycin is particularly promising. However, both inhibitors were less specific, as were the other inhibitors used in the study. For example, since lysosomal glucocerebrosidase is also sensitive to inhibitors, none of the inhibitors were considered very useful for administration to Gaucher patients who are already deficient in glucocerebrosidase. In addition, the inhibitors inhibit the alglucerase and imiglucerase used in enzyme therapy, causing more serious problems for patients receiving enzyme therapy.\n\nIC for glucosylceramidase\n50\nCells were cultured in the presence of concentrations of deoxynojirimycin and butyl-deoxynojirimycin (20 and 0.3 μM, respectively), resulting in significant inhibition of glucocerebrosidase activity (approximately 20 and 10%, respectively) and glucosyl. Inhibition of ceramide synthase activity (approximately 30 and 20%, respectively) was observed. There is also a report that this inhibitor inhibits ER (endoplasmic reticulum) a-glucosidase I activity [N-linking glycan trimming] in a similar concentration range in several cells (reference) Reference 15).\n\nGiven the unfavorable results of known glucosidase inhibitors, the present inventors designed a novel, more specific inhibitor of glucosylceramidase using established information on the properties of glucosylceramidase. .\n\nAs a result, it was found that a potent and specific glucosyl ceramidase inhibitor has the following properties.\n\n1-Deoxynojirimycin moiety\n\nA relatively potent inhibitor of established glucosylceramidase enzyme activity.\n\n2- N-alkyl spacer\n\nIt has become clear from our study that N-alkylation of deoxynojirimycin increases the ability to inhibit glucosylceramidase.\n\n3- A large hydrophobic moiety that can enter a lipid bilayer membrane, preferably a cell membrane (and invaded cell membrane), coupled to a spacer\n\nWhen an inhibitor is inserted into a membrane containing glucosylceramidase, the inhibitory ability and specificity of the inhibitor in vivo is improved.\n\n\nDeoxynojirimycin-analog synthesis\n \n\nIn order to study the inventors' ideas and develop an ideal glucosylceramidase inhibitor, a series of chemical deoxynojirimycin derivatives were synthesized. Based on the above idea, a series of deoxynojirimycin (DNM) derivatives as shown below were synthesized (Formula 1):\n\n\n\nIn the above structure, X is a saturated alkane chain and R is a large nonpolar group. Such a compound is a reductive amino acid of deoxynojirimycin hydrochloride (DNM.HCl) (Reference 18) obtained from a commercially available tetrabenzyl-glucopyranose by a seven-step reaction and an appropriate aldehyde. (Reference 19) is a compound obtained by the reaction (Scheme 1).\n\n\n\nThe following two compounds were synthesized: N- (5-cholesteroloxypentyl) -deoxynojirimycin [N- (5-cholesteroloxy-pentyl) -deoxynojirimycin] (compound 9) and N- (5-adamantane-1- Ilyl-methoxypentyl) -deoxynojirimycin [N- (5-adamantane-1-yl-methoxy-pentyl) -deoxynojirimycin] (compound 10) is exemplified (Scheme 2). Specifically, glutaraldehyde (Compound 1) was first converted to monoacetal (Compound 2) using an ion exchange resin as a catalyst (Reference Document 20). After reduction of the resulting monoacetal to the corresponding alcohol (compound 3) and conversion to the mesylate (compound 4), under basic conditions, the appropriate alcohol (ROH is Compound 5 and 6 which are acetals were obtained by reaction with cholesterol or adamantane methanol. After the formation of a second free aldehyde group by deprotection (ie, formation of compounds 7 and 8), a reductive amination reaction between the obtained compound and deoxynojirimycin hydrochloride is carried out to obtain the target compound 9 and 10 was obtained.\n\n\n\n\nQuantifying the inhibitory effects of deoxynojirimycin-analogs\n \n\nThe inhibitory effects of various deoxynojirimycin analogs on related enzymes were analyzed in vitro and in experimental systems using cells.\n\n\nin vitro experiments\n \n\nFirst, in vitro experiments were conducted using purified human-derived enzymes and cell membrane suspensions obtained from human tissues. The experiment was conducted focusing on the inhibition of lysosomal glucocerebrosidase and glucosylceramidase activities and the inhibition of lysosomal a-glucosidase activity. As glucosylceramidase, a membrane fraction obtained from human spleen was used. The glucosylceramidase activity was measured as the hydrolytic resolution of 4MU-b-glucoside (4MU-b-glucoside) using a membrane fraction pretreated with conzrit B-epoxide to quench the activity of glucocerebrosidase. As glucocerebrosidase, human placental enzyme used for enzyme therapy (ceredase, manufactured by Boston, USA, Genezyme Corp), or a membrane fraction obtained from human spleen was used. The activity of glucocerebrosidase was measured as the hydrolytic ability of 4MU-b-glucoside, which can be inhibited by Conzrit B-epoxide. The activity of lysosome-derived a-glucosidase was measured as the hydrolytic ability of 4MU-b-glucoside by the purified a-glucosidase preparation.\n\nTables 6 and 7 show the structures of the compounds used in the test. Table 3 shows the Ki of the inhibitors obtained by the measurement.\n\nAs is apparent from Table 3, glucosylceramidase is strongly inhibited by N-alkyl derivatives of deoxynojirimycin. Optimal inhibitory activity was seen with N-pentyl derivatives. The effect of N-hexyl-deoxynojirimycin was slightly inferior (not shown in Table 3). In addition, the presence of a carbonyl group in the spacer adversely affects the inhibitory ability.\n\nCoupling a large hydrophobic group such as adamantane (P21) or cholesterol (P24) with a spacer consisting of N-pentyl dramatically improves the ability of the compound to inhibit glucosylceramide activity.\n\nFor some inhibitors, the IC\n50\nWas also measured. Apparent IC of P21 and P24\n50\nWere very low, 1 nM and 0.1 μM, respectively. IC of deoxynojirimycin and butyl-deoxynojirimycin measured for comparison\n50\nWere 20 μM and 0.3 μM, respectively.\n\nTable 3 shows that glucocerebrosidase is generally slightly less sensitive to inhibitors than glucosylceramidase.\n\nPure glucocerebrosidase (seledase) in solution and the enzyme associated with the membrane show different susceptibility to inhibitors. The Km values measured for 4MU-b-glucoside were different, suggesting that the enzymes in two different states have different kinetic properties.\n\nBoth soluble glucocerebrosidase and membrane-bound glucocerebrosidase are most strongly inhibited by deoxynojirimycin-analogs containing large hydrophobic moieties coupled via a spacer consisting of N-pentyl.\n\nApparent IC in soluble glucocerebrosidase (seledase)\n50\nWas 0.2 μM for P21 and 0.8 μM for P24. Apparent IC in membrane-bound glucocerebrosidase\n50\nWere 0.06 μM and 0.7 μM for P21 and P24, respectively.\n\nRegarding a-glucosidase derived from lysosome, even when a part of deoxynojirimycin was substituted, the change in inhibitory capacity was hardly changed as a whole. However, P4, P11, P16, P9 and P13 were very weak inhibitors.\n\n\nIn vivo experiments\n \n\nNext, the ability of deoxynojirimycin-analogues to inhibit the activity of glucosylceramidase activity and glucocerebrosidase activity of the cell itself was examined. The enzyme activity was measured according to the method of Reference 17. In the experiment, the hydrolysis of 4MU-b-glucoside by melanoma cells was measured using cultured melanoma cells previously cultured in the presence or absence of Conslit B-epoxide. Conslit B-epoxide sensitive activity is glucosyl ceramidase activity and Conslit B-epoxide insensitive activity is glucocerebrosidase activity. The results of this experiment are shown in Table 4.\n\nComparison of Table 3 and Table 4 showed that the inhibition of glucosylceramidase activity by deoxynojirimycin-analogue in melanoma cells itself was the same result as in an in vitro experiment using a spleen cell membrane preparation. . Of the analogs used in the experiments, the most effective inhibitors are P21 and P24, and IC\n50\nThe values of were about 0.3 nM and 50 nM, respectively. The inhibitor is IC\n50\nNo significant inhibition of glucocerebrosidase activity was detected even at a value of 10 and its concentration 10 times (see Table 4).\n\nAlso, deoxynojirimycin-analog inhibition constants were determined using the metabolism of C6-NBD glucosylceramide by melanoma cells. In this experiment, conslit B-epoxide was also used to distinguish between insensitive glucosylceramidase activity and sensitive glucocerebrosidase activity for this compound. The result of the experiment using C6-NBD glucosylceramide as a substrate was almost the same as the experiment using fluorescently labeled 4MU-b-glucoside as a substrate (results not shown).\n\nTo examine how other reactions are inhibited by analogues of deoxynojirimycin, IC for glucosylceramidase activity\n50\nCells were cultured using P21 and P24 at concentrations as follows. Under such culture conditions, inhibition of glycogen synthase in rat hepatocytes, glucosylceramide synthase in cultured melanoma cells, and a-glucosidase derived from lysosome was not observed.\n\nSince glucosyl ceramidase shows very high sensitivity to P21, it was next examined whether this inhibition reaction is an irreversible reaction. To perform the experiments, cultured myeloma cells were pre-cultured in the presence and absence of P21, followed by extensive washing of the cells. Next, using the obtained cells, the activities of glucocerebrosidase and glucosylceramidase using 4MU-b-glucoside as a substrate were measured. As a result, pretreatment with inhibitors did not show a significant effect on glucocerebrosidase activity, but caused irreversible loss of glucosylceramidase activity.\n\n\nProof of effect of the present invention: Effect of deoxynojirimycin-analogue as a substance intervening in macrophage activation\n \n\nP21 (N- (5-adamantane-1-yl-methoxypentyl) -deoxynojirimycin) [N- (5-adamantane-1-yl-methoxy-pentyl) deoxynojirimycin] and butyl-deoxynojirimycin are given to cultured macrophages The impact was examined. 10 mM iminosaccharide dissolved in DMSO was added to macrophage cultures at various dilutions. It was also confirmed that a small amount of DMSO mixed into the culture medium by the above method did not affect the experimental results.\n\nTable 5 shows the results of inhibition of glucocerebrosidase activity and glucosylceramidase activity by deoxynojirimycin analogs in macrophages using C6-NBD glucosylceramide as a substrate. The effect of deoxynojirimycin analog on macrophages was similar to inhibition of enzyme activity in myeloma cells. Table 5 also shows the effect of deoxynojirimycin-analogues on the secretion of chitotriosidase by cells. As is apparent from Table 5, chitotriosidase secretion decreases with inhibition of glucosylceramidase activity, but is not related to lysosomal glucocerebrosidase activity. Furthermore, glucosylceramide synthase activity of macrophages using C6-NBD glucosylceramide as a substrate was also measured. As a result, it was revealed that this enzyme activity was not significantly inhibited even when 5 μM butyldeoxynojirimycin, which decreases the secretion of chitotriosidase, was present in the culture medium. Furthermore, the presence of PDMP and PPMP that inhibit glucosylceramide synthase was found not to affect the secretion of chitotriosidase.\n\nIn conclusion, from the above experiments, macrophages that secrete large amounts of chitotriosidase (along with other hydrolases and cytokines) by low concentrations of butyldeoxynojirimycin and in particular P21, due to their specific inhibitory ability against glucosylceramidase. Has been shown to inactivate. Therefore, the effect of the present invention was proved experimentally.\n\n\nUses of glucosylceramidase activity inhibitors\n \n\nOne use of a newly developed inhibitor with very high specificity may include therapeutic intervention for Gaucher disease. As described above, the effect of inhibitors on macrophage activation is thought to favorably influence the pathogenesis of Gaucher disease. Inhibitor administration is thought to increase the efficiency of enzyme therapy, and the natural consequence is improved clinical efficacy and reduced associated costs.\n\nInhibitors of glucosylceramidase are expected to exert favorable effects on other diseases characterized by high concentrations of chitotriosidase in the cytoplasm, such as Niemann-Pick disease and sarcoidosis (see References 4 and 5). reference). Furthermore, it is known that foam cells of atherosclerosis excessively produce chitotriosidase.\n\nThe ceramide-mediated signal transduction system is thought to be directly or indirectly affected by inhibition of glucosylceramidase activity. Therefore, the possible uses of the developed inhibitors are very widespread, especially the symptoms of inflammatory diseases caused by TNF-α and other proinflammatory cytokines in ceramide-mediated signal transduction. Applications related to are attracting attention. Specifically, application to septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis and Coulomb disease is exemplified.\n\nThe optimal method of administration of the pharmaceutical composition and its composition can be selected within the ordinary knowledge of the person skilled in the art. For example, suitable administration methods for the present invention are parenteral (intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular) injection, infusion, oral administration, and topical administration. As a particularly preferable method, it is preferable to use an oily excipient and to release the drug from a storable preparation over a long period of time. However, it is difficult to use oily excipients for oral administration and intravenous injection. In the case of oral administration, absorption of lipophilic compounds in the digestive system occurs simultaneously with dissolution of the compound in the mixed micelle state, followed by absorption by diffusion through the intestinal lining. In the case of intravenous injection, liposomes in which a lipophilic compound has been previously incorporated can be used.\n\nExample\n\n\n5,5-Diethoxypentan-1-ol (3)\n \n\n5,5-diethoxypentanal (1) (3 g, 17 mmol) and NaBH\nFour\n(0.65 g, 17 mmol) was stirred in 30 ml of ethanol at room temperature for 3 hours, and then the solvent was distilled off to obtain a residue.

Contractility after myogenic differentiation of USC. Differentiation of USC to a SMC fate was induced by growth for 7 days in culture medium with transforming growth factor-P1 (TGF-β1, 2.5 ng/ml) plus platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB, 5 ng/ml). The induced USC (open bars) were compared with normal SMC isolated from human bladder (cross-hatched bars) and with undifferentiated USC (patterned bars). Cells were then placed in stabilized collagen type I lattices (1 mg/ml) and cultured for 5 days in the presence of 10% FBS (positive control), or in serum-free medium followed by stimulation with 1 μM calcium ionophore A23187 as an agonist, or in the serum-free medium without exposure to the calcium ionophore (negative control). The collagen lattice was released, and the extent of contraction exerted by the cells was determined. The mean diameter of the gel was recorded before and 10 min after release, and the percentage decrease in diameter was calculated.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention concerns stem cells and methods of selecting and culturing multipotent stem cells from urine. Advantageously, cells found in urine may be obtained without the need for a tissue biopsy, preventing discomfort and possible complications associated with the harvest of cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disclosures of all cited United States Patent references are hereby incorporated by reference to the extent that they are consistent with the disclosures herein. As used herein in the description of the invention and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Furthermore, the terms “about” and “approximately” as used herein when referring to a measurable value such as an amount of a compound, dose, time, temperature, and the like, is meant to encompass variations of 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%, 0.5%, or even 0.1% of the specified amount. Also, as used herein, “and/or” and “/” refer to and encompass any and all possible combinations of one or more of the associated listed items, as well as the lack of combinations when interpreted in the alternative (“or”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Urine stem cells” or “USC” are cells normally found in, and collected and/or isolated from, urine, which cells as disclosed herein possess both pluripotency and proliferative potential. A USC is “pluripotent” in that it is capable of giving rise to various cell types within one or more lineages. For example, USC according to some embodiments possess the potential to differentiate into one or more of the following: bladder urothelial, smooth muscle, endothelium, interstitial cells, and even bone, muscle, epithelial cells and other types of cells and tissues (e.g., fat, cartilage, nerve). A previous report has indicated that urothelial cells may be able to differentiate into mature chondrocytes (Fernandez-Conde, \nBone \n(1996) 18(3):289-91).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUSC used to carry out the present invention are preferably mammalian cells, including primate muscle cells, including but not limited to human, pig, goat, horse, mouse, rat, monkey, baboon, etc. USC of other species, including birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, may also be used, if so desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells sloughed from the urinary tract lumen are generally believed to be old or damaged superficial cells that are difficult to culture and maintain in vitro. A few cells obtained from urine may grow rapidly on feeding layer cells. However, feeding layer cells are usually derived from embryonic mouse tissues that might transfer viruses from animal to human when human cells are cultured with the mouse feeder cells. To avoid this complication, according to some embodiments the UPCs disclosed herein can be grown without feeding layer cells. The UPCs possess mesenchymal stem cell features and show proliferative capability and pluripotency potential.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout wishing to be bound by theory, our studies indicate that there are mixed cell populations in urine: stem cells and mature cells as well. As disclosed herein, urine contains urothelial stem cells and smooth muscle stem cells, as well as endothelial and interstitial stem cells. Stem cells that are found in urine may originate from bladder tissue, renal tissue, etc. In some embodiments, USC undergo selection against cells of renal origin. This can be accomplished by, for example, passaging the collected cells, as it is thought that renal cells generally do not survive passaging. In some embodiments USC will double upon growing between 24-48 hours (e.g., every 31.3 hours), allowing them to be grown in large quantities. In further embodiments, USC do not induce tumor formation (as compared to embryonic stem cells), and in some embodiments USC do not require feeder cells for growth or differentiation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Isolated” signifies that the cells are placed into conditions other than their natural environment. However, the term “isolated” does not preclude the later use of these cells thereafter in combinations or mixtures with other cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Subjects” are generally human subjects and include, but are not limited to, “patients.” The subjects may be male or female and may be of any race or ethnicity, including, but not limited to, Caucasian, African-American, African, Asian, Hispanic, Indian, etc. The subjects may be of any age, including newborn, neonate, infant, child, adolescent, adult, and geriatric. In some embodiments, subjects are from 0-5 years old, from 6-15 years old, from 16-25 years old, from 26-45 years old, and/or from 46-65 years old.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubjects may also include animal subjects, particularly mammalian subjects such as canines, felines, bovines, caprines, equines, ovines, porcines, rodents (e.g., rats and mice), lagomorphs, primates (including non-human primates), etc., for, e.g., veterinary medicine and/or pharmaceutical drug development purposes.\n\n\n \n1. Collection of Cells.\n\n\n \n \n \nUrine stem cells may be collected from any animal that produces urine, including humans. In some embodiments of the present invention, urine stem cells are collected from the urine of a mammal. For example, USC may be collected from the urine of a dog, cat, pig, cow, horse, monkey or human. In particular embodiments, urine stem cells are obtained from the urine of a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUrine stem cells may be collected from any portion of the urinary tract. In some embodiments, USC are collected from the upper urinary tract (UUT) (kidneys, ureter), e.g., via a catheter such as a nephrostomy catheter. In other embodiments, USC are collected from the lower urinary tract (bladder, urethra), via a catheter such as a urinary catheter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, USC are collected from samples of fresh spontaneous urine, or drainage urine through a urethral catheter or from a bladder wash. Urine samples can be centrifuged at 1500 RPM for 5 minutes at 4° C., the supernatant aspirated and cells washed with a suitable solution such as phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The PBS may optionally contain 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin to protect cells from injury and potential infection, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther examples of methods and apparatuses for isolating cells from biological fluids may be found in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,912,116; U.S. Patent Application No. 20040087017; U.S. Patent Application No. 20020012953; and WO 2005/047529.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally speaking, we have found three types of cells in urine: 1) fully-differentiated urothelial cells, which are approximately 99% of the cells; 2) various differentiating cells (e.g., endothelial-like cells, epithelial-like cells, stromal-like cells, interstitial-like cells), which are approximately 0.1-0.2% of the cells, and 3) urine stem cells as described herein, which are approximately 0.2-0.7% of the cells.\n\n\n \n2. Selection and Propagation of Cells.\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, collected USC are expanded. “Expanding” refers to an increase in number of viable cells. Expanding may be accomplished by, e.g., growing the cells through one or more cell cycles wherein at least a portion of the cells divide to produce additional cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “primary culture” is the first culture to become established after seeding collected cells into a culture vessel. “Passaging” refers to the transfer or subculture of a culture to a second culture vessel, usually implying mechanical or enzymatic disaggregation, reseeding, and often division into two or more daughter cultures, depending upon the rate of proliferation. If the population is selected for a particular genotype or phenotype, the culture becomes a “cell strain” upon subculture, i.e., the culture is homogeneous and possesses desirable characteristics. The establishment of “cell lines,” as opposed to cell strains, are by and large undifferentiated, though they may be committed to a particular lineage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUSC according to some embodiments may be passaged from 0, 1 or 2 to 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 times. In some embodiments, one USC clone can generate 10\n6 \ncells in 3-4 weeks. According to some embodiments, 10\n9 \ncells may be generated from 3 or 4 urine samples in 6-7 weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Selection” can be based upon any unique properties that distinguish one cell type from another, e.g., density, size, unique markers, unique metabolic pathways, nutritional requirements, protein expression, protein excretion, etc. For example, cells may be selected based on density and size with the use of centrifugal gradients. Unique markers may be selected with fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS), immunomagnetic bead sorting, magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS), panning, etc. Unique metabolic pathways and nutritional requirements may be exploited by varying the makeup and/or quantity of nutritional ingredients of the medium on which cells are grown, particularly in a serum-free environment. Protein expression and/or excretion may be detected with various assays, e.g., ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, USC are selected by providing cells isolated from urine in a particular growing environment that promotes the growth of stem cells, such as stem cell medium. In some embodiments, the stem cell medium contains ¾ DMEM, ¼ Ham's F12, 10% FBS, 0.4 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 10\n−10 \nM, Chron Toxin, 5 mg/ml, insulin, 1.2 mg/ml adenine, 2.5 mg/ml transferrin plus 0.136 mg/\nml\n 3,39,5-triiodo-L-thyronine, 10 mg/ml EGF, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Zhang et al., In vitro Cell Dev. Biol.-Animal 37:419, 2001). In further embodiments, isolated USC are provided in a particular growing environment that promotes the selective differentiation of the stem cells. For example, in some embodiments USC grown in keratinocyte serum free medium develop into urothelium. In further embodiments, USC grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum develop into smooth muscle-like cells. In some embodiments, endothelial-like cells may be cultured in M199 with 20% FBS, 2 mmol/l L-glutamine, EGF (5 nl/ml) 1% sodium pyruvate and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. In some embodiments, interstitial-like cells may be cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/l L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, USC are selected by morphology. For example, cells isolated from urine may be diluted to a concentration allowing for the isolation of single cells (e.g., cells can be diluted to a concentration of approximately 0.5 cells/well in a multi-well plate), and observed under a microscope. Wells containing single cells can be retained for expansion, and selected by observed morphology, e.g., urothelium, smooth muscle, endothelium and/or interstitial cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUrine stem cells according to some embodiments of the present invention can be identified, selected, and/or isolated based on one or more “markers.” Such markers include specific gene expression, antigenic molecules found on the surface of such cells, etc. In particular embodiments, urine stem cells are selected and isolated based upon the expression of at least one specific maker. In some embodiments, USC have one or more of the following markers such as CD117 (C-kit), SSEA-4, CD105, CD73, CD90, CD133, and CD44, and do not have an appreciable amount of one or more of the following markers: CD31, CD34, and CD45. Accordingly, certain embodiments embrace selecting and isolating urine stem cells which express one or more of CD117, SSEA-4, CD105, CD73, CD90, CD133, and CD44 and/or lack expression of one or more of CD31, CD34, and CD45. For example, in some embodiments a urine stem cell of the present invention is identified, selected, and/or isolated based on the expression of CD117. Urine stem cells according to some embodiments also express MSC/pericyte markers such as CD146 (MCAM), NG2 (a related antigen), and/or PDGF-Receptor (PDGF-R(3). Marker expression may be probed by methods known in the art, e.g., western blot, RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, FACS, etc. In some embodiments, USC are positive for a marker selected from: CD133, SSEA-A, CD90, CD73, CD105, pericyte CD146 (MCAM), NG2, PDGF-Receptorβ (PDGF-Rβ), and combinations thereof, and wherein said cell is negative for a marker selected from CD31, CD34, CD45, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments USC can be obtained as disclosed herein by collecting cells from a urine sample, e.g., by centrifugation, and/or directly plating the cells in or on a suitable medium, and/or selecting and isolating urine stem cells based upon stem-specific cell marker expression (e.g., via immunohistochemistry or western blot analysis). Alternatively, urine stem cells may be obtained by collecting and selecting cells via fluorescence-activated cell sorting, e.g., using a marker-specific antibody (e.g., anti-CD117 antibody) conjugated to a fluorophore (e.g., APC, phycoerythrin, allophycocyanins, fluorescein, TEXAS RED, etc.), or magnetic selection using a marker-specific antibody conjugated to magnetic particles. By way of illustration, cells may be incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody that specifically binds to the extracellular domain (amino acids 23-322) of the CD117 receptor protein (De Coppi, et al. (2007) \nNat. Biotechnol. \n25:100). The CD117-positive cells can be purified by incubation with magnetic Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG MicroBeads and selected on a Mini-MACS apparatus. Urine stem cells may also be selected with a monoclonal anti-CD117 antibody directly conjugated to MicroBeads. Any suitable method for selection including attachment to and disattachment from a solid phase is contemplated within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUrine stem cells according to some embodiments of the present invention can be routinely passaged or subcultured, e.g., by a 1:4 dilution and permitted to expand to about 50-70% confluency. Isolated populations of urine stem cells can be routinely grown and maintained under conventional culture conditions, e.g., a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n2 \nat 37° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGrowth may be accomplished by using initial culture in multiwell plates in a medium supplemented with 5% serum plus epidermal growth factor (EGF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile cells of the invention can be grown in complex media with KFSM-Stem cell medium (1:1) (Zhang et al., \nIn vitro Cell Dev. Biol\n.-\nAnimal \n37:419, 2001), it will generally be preferable that the cells be maintained in a simple serum-free medium such as KSFM for urothelial stem cells, or medium with 10% FBS for smooth muscle or interstitial stem cells such as Dulbecco's Minimal Essential Media (DMEM), Hank's Basic Salt Solution (HBSS), Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), RPMI, or Iscove's-modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM), in order to effect more precise control over the differentiation of the stem cell into the desired cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum-free media used according to some embodiments includes endothelium culture medium-2 (EGM-2, Lonza). In other embodiments, a serum free media may be provided that is keratinocyte-serum free medium (KSFM, Sigma) and progenitor cell medium (PCM) in a 1:1 ratio. KSFM can be supplemented with bovine pituitary extract (50 mg/ml), and cholera toxin (30 ng/ml), but in some embodiments does not contain EGF. PCM contains DMEM and Ham's F12 basal media (3:1) supplemented with 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 10\n−10 \nM cholera toxin, 5 ng/ml insulin, 1.8×10\n−4 \nM adenine, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 2×10\n−9\n \nM\n 3,39,5-triiodo-L-thyronine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClone urine stem cell lines can also be generated by a conventional limiting dilution method either in 96-well plates or 24-well plates. Once cell colonies form, the cells are detached and transferred into multi-well dishes.\n\n\n \n3. Differentiation of Urine Stem Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nUpon appropriate stimulation, USC can be differentiated into various cell types. “Differentiated” refers to cells or a population containing cells that have specialized functions, e.g., expression of known markers of differentiated cells. In this sense they are not progenitor or stem cells. For example, in some embodiments USC can differentiate into mesenchymal stem cell lineages such as osteocyte, chondrocyte, adipocyte, nerve and muscle cells. Some embodiments of the present invention are subject to the proviso that harvested differentiated cells are not passaged under conditions to create a population of less specialized cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, USC are differentiated using methods known in the art for induction of differentiation of multipotent cells into a specific lineage, e.g., osteogenic (bone), chondrogenic (cartilage), adipogenic (fat), neurogenic (nerve), myogenic (muscle), etc. Exemplary of methods of differentiating the USC are provided below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, USC undergo hypoxia preconditioning by culturing in a 1-2% O\n2\n, environment as known in the art (e.g., a humidified incubator at 37° C., at atmospheric pressure, and with 1-2% O\n2\n, 5% CO\n2 \nand 94% N2) (e.g., for 2, 4, 6, 10, 18, 24, 36 or 48 hours). This may enhance the tissue regenerating ability of USC (see, e.g., Rosova et al., Stem Cells, 2008). It has been demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells cultured in hypoxic conditions may be able to better differentiate and show enhanced self-renewal (Grayson et al., J. Cell Physiol., 2006; Lennon et al., J. Cell Physiol., 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOsteogenic induction. Seed cells at a density of 4,000 cells/cm\n2 \nand culture in DMEM low-glucose medium with 10% FBS (FBS, Gibco/BRL), antibiotics (Pen/Strep, Gibco/BRL), and osteogenic supplements (100 nM dexamethasone, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.05 mM ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (Wako Chemicals, Irving, Tex.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChondrogenic induction. \nPellet\n 3×10\n5 \ncells in 0.5 ml of DMEM low glucose medium with antibiotics (Pen/Strep) and chondrogenic supplements (100 nM dexamethasone, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid phosphate, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml selenium, 100 μg/ml sodium pyruvate, 40 μg/ml proline, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 ng/ml TGF-β3) a sterile 15 ml conical polypropylene tube by centrifuging at 600 g for 5 min. Place tubes in the cell culture incubator with the caps loosened to permit gas exchange. The sedimented cells form a spherical mass of cells and float on the media within 24 h. Replace media every three for 21 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdipogenic induction. Seed cells at a density of 10,000 cells/cm\n2 \nand culture in DMEM low-glucose medium with 10% FBS, antibiotics (Pen/Strep, Gibco/BRL), and adipogenic supplements (1 mM dexamethasone, 500 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 10 mg/ml insulin, 100 mM indomethacin (Sigma-Aldrich)) for 21 days with media changes every third day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMyogenic induction. Seed cells at a density of 3,000 cells/cm\n2 \non plastic plates without coating or coated with Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products; incubation for 1 h at 37° C. at 1 mg/ml in DMEM) in DMEM low-glucose formulation containing 10% horse serum (Gibco/BRL), 0.5% chick embryo extract (Gibco/BRL) and Pen/Strep. Twelve hours after seeding, add 3 mM 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-azaC; Sigma-Aldrich) to the culture medium for 24 h. Then continue incubation in complete medium lacking 5-azaC, with medium changes every 3 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, DMEM low glucose with dexamethasone and hydrocortisone may be used for myogenic induction. In some embodiments, SkGM-2 or SkBM-DM medium with 2% horse serum may be used for myogenic induction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEndothelial induction. Seed cells at 3,000 cells/cm\n2 \non plastic plates precoated with 0.1% gelatin and maintain in culture for 1 month in endothelial cell medium-2 (EGM™-2, Clonetics; Cambrex Bioproducts) supplemented with 10% FBS, and Pen/Strep. Add Recombinant human bFGF (StemCell Technologies) at intervals of 2 d at 2 ng/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeurogenic induction. Seed cells at a concentration of 3,000 cells/cm\n2 \non tissue culture plastic plates and culture in DMEM low-glucose medium, Pen/Strep, supplemented with 2% DMSO, 10 mM all-trans retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mg/ml basic FGF. After 2 d return the cells to growth medium lacking basic FGF and culture for 10-14 days. Add fresh bFGF every second day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther examples of conditions that may be used to differentiate USC according to some embodiments can be found in U.S. Patent Application No. 2005/0124003 to Atala et al. In some embodiments, USC are differentiated using known techniques for differentiating mesenchymal stem cells. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,942,225 to Bruder et al., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0057693 to Simon, U.S. Pat. No. 5,811,094 to Caplan et al. See also Pittenger et al., “Stem Cell Culture: Mesenchymal Stem Cells from Bone Marrow,” Chapter 38, pp. 461-469, in \nMethods of Tissue Engineering \n(Atala and Lanza, Eds., 2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, growth factors (e.g., nerve growth factor (NGF), aFGF, bFGF, PDGF, TGFβ, VEGF, GDF-5/6/7, BMP-1/2/3/4/5/6/7/13/12/14, IGF-1, etc.) or other mitogenic agents are included in the media or carrier to promote proliferation and differentiation of distinct populations of cells. In this regard, particular embodiments of the invention embrace culturing urine stem cells with selective medium that supports the growth and differentiation of the urine stem cells into urothelial, smooth muscle, interstitial cells, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, USC may be transfected with nucleic acids expressing growth factors or other mitogenic agents. For example, USC according to some embodiments are transfected with the growth factor VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). Transfection may be carried out in accordance with methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifferentiation in the present context refers to a status of cells in which the cells develop specific morphological or functional properties. By way of illustration, when urine stem cells are grown in keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM) supplemented with 0.09 mM calcium, the cells differentiate into urothelium. Likewise, urine stem cells cultured in DMEM supplemented with serum, e.g., 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) promotes differentiation into smooth muscle cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of whether a USC has differentiated into a specific type of cell can be achieved by morphological analysis and/or the detection of markers specific to these cell types and as generally known in the art. For example, urothelial cells can be identified by the presence of one or more of urothelial-specific markers including, e.g., uroplakin, \ncytokeratin\n 7, \ncytokeratin\n 13, \ncytokeratin\n 17, and \ncytokeratin\n 19 and \ncytokeratin\n 20; whereas smooth muscle cells can be identified by the presence of one or more smooth muscle-specific markers including, e.g., alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin, calponin and myosin. Cell type-specific marker expression can be determined using any suitable conventional method include, e.g., immunohistochemistry and/or western blot analyses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdipocyte differentiation can be determined by, e.g., the presence of the transcription factor PPARγ and/or lipoprotein lipase (LpL). Chondrocyte differentiation can be determined by, e.g., the presence of chondrogenic lineage markers Sox9, collagen II and/or aggrecan. Osteocyte differentiation can be determined by, e.g., the presence of mineralized bone (von Kossa stain), calcium deposition (Alzarin Red stain), osteocalcin, Runx2 and/or alkaline phosphatase. Endothelial differentiation can be determined by, e.g., the presence of vWF and/or CD 31. Neurogenic differentiation can be determined by, e.g., the presence of nestin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, if desired, the cells can be frozen or cryopreserved prior to use, and then thawed to a viable form. Methods of freezing or cryopreserving cells (for subsequent return to viable form) are well known in the art. For example, cryopreservation of cells can involve freezing the cells in a mixture of a growth medium and another liquid that prevents water from forming ice crystals, and then storing the cells at liquid nitrogen temperatures (e.g., from about −80 to about −196° C.). See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,783,964.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUrothelial cells (UC). In some embodiments, USC can differentiate into cells with urothelial phenotype in KSFM:PCM with 5% FBS and EGF. In other embodiments, serum-free medium is used, e.g., with EGF and low calcium (0.09 mM), to induce urothelium differentiation from USC. If desired, factors can also be used to enhance epithelial differentiation of stem cells, for example, collagen IV (10 μg/ml), bladder extracellular matrix (ECM) (0.1 mg/ml), and/or CM (obtained using primary cultured bladder urothelium, essentially as described below for SMC). Culture dishes in some embodiments are coated with collagen IV or bladder mucosa ECM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, USC are seeded on tissue culture plastic or matrices, and allowed to grow in KSFM:PCM with EGF for 7 and 14 days, respectively. Culture medium is changed every two days. Cells are analyzed for urothelial differentiation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe bladder mucosa normally consists of three layers of urothelium (i.e., superficial, interment, and basal urothelium). Uroplakins are urothelium-specific markers, CK20 for superficial urothelium, CK13 for interment, and basal urothelium, and CK7 for all three layers of urothelium. The parameters to evaluate urothelial differentiation of USC include urothelium markers (uroplakin Ia, II, III and CK7, CK13, CK20) and tight junctions assessed with immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and western blot.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, UC differentiated from USC show barrier functionality. Permeability barrier function of urothelium can be tested after stratified urothelia consisting of basal, intermediate and superficial cells are induced in physiological concentrations of calcium as described previously (Cross W R, Eardley I, Leese H J, Southgate J. A biomimetic tissue from cultured normal human urothelial cells: analysis of physiological function. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 2005 August; 289(2):F459-468).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor determination of urea and water permeability of USC and urothelial cultures, diffusive urea and water permeability coefficients can be determined by measuring radioisotopic fluxes. After the TER of the USC and urothelial culture is assessed, 25 μl of [\n3\nH] water (200 μCi/ml; Sigma) and 25 l of [\n14\nC] urea (200 μCi/ml; Amersham) is added to the apical hemichamber. During the next 60 min, duplicate 100-1 aliquots are taken from both the apical and basal hemichambers at 15-min intervals and placed into 5-ml scintillation vials (PerkinElmer) containing 4 ml Ultima Gold XR scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer). After sampling, the aliquoted volume is replaced with fresh Krebs solution and the TER will be checked to confirm that the USC and urothelial culture have not been physically disturbed. The number of counts of the individual isotopes within the samples will be determined using a Packard Tri-carb 2700TR liquid scintillation counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor measurement of dextran permeability of USC and urothelial cultures, permeability assays can be performed using dextran (MW 4,400 and 9,500) conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). At the start of the experiments, the medium in the apical compartment of the Snapwell membrane is replaced with 500 μl of the appropriate growth medium containing one of the tracers at 1 mg/ml. The basal compartment is replaced with 1 ml of tracer-free growth medium. The induced USC is returned to the incubator for 3 hrs, and then duplicate 350-μl samples will be taken from the basal compartment and the amount of FITC-dextran will be determined using a MFX microtiter plate fluorometer (Dynex). The amount of diffused dextran is calculated from a titration curve of known concentration (3.1-200 mg/ml).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSmooth muscle cells (SMC). In some embodiments, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β1, 2.5 ng/ml) plus platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB, 5 ng/ml), or vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF, 10 ng/ml) are used to differentiate USC into SMC. In some embodiments, USC are cultured in serum-free myogenic differentiation media (MDM) containing DMEM and PCM (1:1) with each of the above combinations of myogenic growth factors. IGF-1 alone or in combination with the above factors may also be used. Cells can be harvested and analyzed for muscle-like characteristics on \n \ndays\n \n 7 and 14 after seeding in induction medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn alternative method is to add a low level of serum (1-5%) into the medium 7 days after the cells are cultured in serum-free medium. Cells (2×10\n3 \ncells/cm\n2\n) were cultured for 7 days in proliferation medium (DMEM high glucose, 1% FBS, 1% horse serum [HS, GIBCO], 1% CEE [chicken embryo extract, Accurate], 1% PS) and then for 7-10 days in fusion medium (DMEM high glucose, 1% FBS, 1% HS, 0.5% CEE, 1% PS [GIBCO]). Half of the medium is renewed every 4 days. Myogenesis is induced by lowering serum concentration to 2%, and medium is changed every 2 days until elongated myofibers appear.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferentiation Methods of USC into Different Cell Types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nImmuno-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ndifferentiated\n\n\n \n\n\nRT-PCR\n\n\nWestern blot\n\n\nhistochemistry\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncell type\n\n\nInducing agents\n\n\nPrimers\n\n\nAntibodies\n\n\nAntibodies\n\n\nCell function\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMC-like\n\n\n1.

Briefly, induced USC, bladder SMC (positive controls), and non-induced USC (negative controls) (each at 3×10\n5 \ncells/ml) are cultured within a stabilized type I collagen lattices (1 mg/ml). After 5 days of cultivation, the cell-collagen lattice is mechanically released. Contractility action is assayed by measuring the diameter prior to release and at various times after release. A 10-minute time period is used for comparison of the relative amount of contraction for the different lattices. Cell-collagen lattices which will be released in M199 with 10% fetal bovine serum as described above serve as positive controls. For the negative controls, cell-collagen lattices will be washed twice with serum-free media and then further incubated for an additional 5 minutes and released under serum-free conditions. Contractile response to a defined agonist (Ca-ionophore A23187, 10\n−5 \nM) can be performed in a similar manner, except that agonist is added to the serum-free media immediately prior to lattice release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSmooth muscle tissue produced as described herein may be used in vitro to examine the pharmacological or toxicological properties of compounds of interest (e.g., by adding the compound of interest to a culture medium in which the tissue is immersed, and examining the histological or mechanical properties of the tissue as compared to a control tissue).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSmooth muscle tissue (with or without matrix support) according to some embodiments is “suturable” in that it has sufficient structural integrity to be surgically sutured or otherwise fastened at either end when implanted and thereafter develop tension upon contraction. Smooth muscle tissue produced as described herein may be used for the reconstruction of damaged tissue in a patient, e.g., a patient with a disease traumatic injury of an organ (e.g., bladder).\n\n\n \n4. Methods of Treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \nUrine stem cells and/or cells differentiated from urine stem cells as disclosed herein find use in a variety of methods of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Treat” as used herein refers to any type of treatment that imparts a benefit to a patient, e.g., a patient afflicted with or at risk for developing a disease. Treating includes actions taken and actions refrained from being taken for the purpose of improving the condition of the patient (e.g., the relief of one or more symptoms), delay in the onset or progression of the disease, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiseases that may be treated with the methods disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, augmentation or replacement of urinary tract tissues. For example, urine stem cells may be used in treating diseases and conditions of the urinary tract, e.g., bladder exstrophy; bladder volume insufficiency; reconstruction of bladder following partial or total cystectomy; repair of bladders, kidneys or ureters damaged by trauma; urological cell therapy for patient with stress urinary continence and vesicoureteral reflux, and the like. Treatment in accordance with some embodiment involve urinary tract diseases and conditions such as congenital abnormalities, cancer, trauma, radiation, infection, iatrogenic injures, nerve injury or other causes. Generally, treatment involves altering urinary tract function; improving urinary tract function; or reconstructing, repairing, augmenting, or replacing damaged urinary tract cells or whole tissues or organs to prevent or treat diseases or conditions of the urinary tract. In this regard, urine stem cells can be used in tissue engineering of urinary tract structures such as ureters, bladders, urethra, renal pelvic, kidney, bone, cartilage, muscle, skin, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, USC find application in the pharmacology of the lower urinary tract and as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for detection of nephrological and/or urinary tract diseases. Cells according to some embodiments of the present invention can be used to diagnose diseases such as hematuria or tumors in the urinary tract system, e.g., tumors of the bladder, renal pelvic, kidney, ureters, prostate gland and urethra; renal diseases such as renal diabetes, renal tubule necrosis, acute or chronic renal failure, and renal rejection after renal transplantation; and other diseases including interstitial cystitis, neuropathic bladder, irradiated bladder, and vesicoureteral reflux or reflux nephropathy. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,733,739, 5,325,169 and 5,741,648. Examples include, but are not limited to, kidney tumor (clear cell tumor), kidney/ureter transitional cancer, non-invasive bladder cancer (Ta, T1 and CIS), invasive bladder cancer (T2 and above), non-invasive prostate cancer, invasive prostate cancer, diabetes nephropathy, cystitis caused by diabetes, interstitial cystitis, radiational cystitis, renal tubule necrosis, acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, obstruction bladder, urinary incontinence, neuropathic bladder, versicoureteral reflux/reflux nephropathy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, acute rejection after renal transplantation, chronic rejection after renal transplantation, polycystic kidney disease, kidney stone, etc. Detection may be performed by isolating, culturing and identifying the diseased cells from the collected sample in accordance with techniques known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUrine stem cells (USC) and cells differentiated from USC find use as a cell source for cell based therapies or tissue engineering. For example, USC may be used in treatment of stress urinary incontinence, in treatment of vesicoureteral reflux, in treatment of muscle dystrophy, in treatment of renal failure, in treatment of cardiac diseases (ischemia heart disease), in treatment of esophageal reflux, in treatment of spinal injury, in treatment of mental diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as a potential cell source for urinary bladder tissue engineering for patients with bladder cancer and dystrophy (in some embodiments collected from the upper urinary tract to avoid collection of disease cells from the lower urinary tract), for skin substitute in treatment of skin wound or burn injury, plastic surgery in need of a cell source to repair defects, etc. USC from the upper urinary tract may be used for urethral reconstruction with tissue engineering technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, USC and/or differentiated USC may be used in the treatment of urinary incontinence. For example, USC and/or USC differentiated into a skeletal myogenic lineage may be used in treatment of urinary stress incontinence in men in which there is urethral sphinctic dysfunction. USC and/or USC differentiated into a smooth muscle cell lineage may be used in treatment of urinary stress incontinence in women in which there is pelvic floor muscle dysfunction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, USC and/or differentiated USC may be used in the treatment of vesicoureteral reflux, in which there is a smooth muscle tissue defect at the ureteral orifice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUrine stem cells may also be used in treating diseases and conditions associated with the loss of bone cells, cartilage, etc., in accordance with methods known in the art. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,396 to Bruder et al.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, in some embodiments treatment involves administration of an effective amount of urine stem cells, e.g., undifferentiated, differentiated or mixtures thereof, to a subject in need of treatment thereby ameliorating or alleviating at least one sign or symptom of the disease or condition of the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn applications where tissues are implanted, in some embodiments cells are of the same species as the subject into which the tissue is to be implanted. In some embodiments cells are autogeneic (i.e., from the subject to be treated), isogeneic (i.e., a genetically identical but different subject, e.g., from an identical twin), allogeneic (i.e., from a non-genetically identical member of the same species) or xenogeneic (i.e., from a member of a different species).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, when cells of the invention are used for treating a subject, the cells are formulated into a pharmaceutical composition containing the cells in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or carrier (e.g., a collagen gel). Such formulations can be prepared using techniques well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Application 2003/0180289; Remington: \nThe Science and Practice of Pharmacy\n, Alfonso R. Gennaro, editor, 20th ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins: Philadelphia, Pa., 2000. In the manufacture of a pharmaceutical formulation according to the invention, the cells are typically admixed with, inter alia, an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with any other ingredients in the formulation and must not be deleterious to the patient. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid, or both (e.g., hydrogels), and can be formulated with the cells as a unit-dose formulation. In one embodiment the cells are provided as a suspension in the carrier to reduce clumping of the cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments a temperative sensitive gel may be used. Examples of temperature sensitive gels include thermaosensitive hydrogels and thermosensitive polymer gels (e.g., a poloxamer such as Pluronic® F-127 (BASF corporation, Mont Olive, N.J.)). See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,201,065, 6,482,435.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, cells are administered in conjunction with other types of cells. For example, in some embodiments USC are administered in conjunction with endothelial cells such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUCEC) in order to promote vascularization. The administration of two or types of cells and/or compounds, etc. “in combination” or “in conjunction” means that the two types of cells and/or compounds are administered closely enough in time to have an additive and/or synergistic effect. They may be administered simultaneously (concurrently) or sequentially. Simultaneous administration may be carried out by mixing prior to administration, or by administering the at the same point in time but at different anatomic sites or using different routes of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the cells are formulated in an encapsulated form (e.g., encapsulated in a capsule that is permeable to nutrients and oxygen to sustain the viability of the cells in vivo). Materials and methods for the encapsulation of cells in permeable capsules are well known and described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,783,964. For example, the cells may be encapsulated in a microcapsule of from 50 or 100 μm to 1 or 2 mm in diameter that comprises an internal cell-containing core of polysaccharide gum surrounded by a semipermeable membrane; a microcapsule that comprises alginate in combination with polylysine, polyornithine, and combinations thereof. Other suitable encapsulating materials include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,444.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment, the cells of the present invention are administered with a biocompatible and/or biodegradable scaffold or matrix. It has been demonstrated that the bladder cells can form normal bladder structures of distinctive layers with urothelium growing on the top of smooth muscle cells after in vitro co-culture on collagen-rich scaffolds (Zhang, et al. (2000) \nJ. Urol. \n164:928). Additionally, bladder cell-seeded scaffold constructs have been shown to take part in the regenerating process of tissue remodeling in a partial cystostomy model (Zhang, et al. (2005) \nBJU Int. \n96:1120). Therefore, embodiments of USC find application in engineering cell-scaffold constructs in vitro for later in vivo implantation to completely regenerate the bladder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA biocompatible scaffold or matrix is any substance not having toxic or injurious effects on biological function, and a biodegradable scaffold is capable of being broken down into its elemental components by a host. Desirably, the scaffold or matrix is porous to allow for cell deposition both on and in the pores of the matrix, and in certain embodiments, is shaped. Such formulations can be prepared by supplying at least one cell population to a biodegradable scaffold to seed the cell population on and/or into the scaffold. In some embodiments the seeded scaffold is then implanted in the body of the recipient subject where the separate, laminarily organized cell populations facilitate the formation of neo-organs or tissue structures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiodegradable scaffolds that may be used include, e.g., natural or synthetic polymers, such as collagen (e.g., SIS and BSM), poly(alpha esters) such as poly(lactate acid), poly(glycolic acid), polyorthoesters and polyanhydrides and their copolymers, which can be degraded by hydrolysis at a controlled rate and are reabsorbed. Examples of other suitable materials are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7,186,554. In some embodiments the scaffold comprises a cellulose polymer, such as a bacterial cellulose polymer. In some embodiments the scaffold comprises hyaluronic acid. In some embodiments the scaffold comprises a polymer selected from PGA/PLGA-PLLA, small intestine submucosa (SIS) and bladder submucose (BSM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe scaffold can be “shaped” using methods such as, for example, solvent casting, compression molding, filament drawing, meshing, leaching, weaving and coating. In solvent casting, a solution of one or more polymers in an appropriate solvent, such as methylene chloride, is cast as a branching pattern relief structure. After solvent evaporation, a thin film is obtained. In compression molding, a polymer is pressed at pressures up to 30,000 pounds per square inch into an appropriate pattern. Filament drawing involves drawing from the molten polymer and meshing involves forming a mesh by compressing fibers into a felt-like material. In leaching, a solution containing two materials is spread into a shape that resembles the final form. Next, a solvent is used to dissolve away one of the components, resulting in pore formation (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,514,378). In nucleation, thin films in the shape of a reconstructive urothelial graft are exposed to radioactive fission products that create tracks of radiation damaged material. Next the polycarbonate sheets are etched with acid or base, turning the tracks of radiation-damaged material into pores. Finally, a laser may be used to shape and burn individual holes through many materials to form a reconstructive urothelial graft structure with uniform pore sizes. These shaping techniques may be employed in combination. For example, a biodegradable matrix can be weaved, compression molded and also glued. Furthermore, different polymeric materials shaped by different processes may be joined together to form a composite shape. The composite shape can be a laminar structure. For example, a polymeric matrix can be attached to one or more polymeric matrixes to form a multilayer polymeric matrix structure. The attachment can be performed by gluing with a liquid polymer or by suturing. In addition, the polymeric matrix can be formed as a solid block and shaped by laser or other standard machining techniques to its desired final form. Laser shaping refers to the process of removing materials using a laser.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe scaffold can be treated with additives or drugs prior to implantation (before or after it is seeded with cells), e.g., to promote the formation of new tissue after implantation. Thus, for example, growth factors, cytokines, extracellular matrix components, and/or other bioactive materials can be added to the biodegradable scaffold to promote graft healing and the formation of new tissue. Such additives will, in general, be selected according to the tissue or organ being reconstructed or augmented, to ensure that appropriate new tissue is formed in the engrafted organ or tissue. For examples of such additives for use in promoting bone healing, see, e.g., Kirker-Head (1995) \nVet. Surg. \n24 (5):408-19.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeeding of cells onto the scaffold may be performed according to standard methods. For example, the seeding of cells onto polymeric substrates for use in tissue repair has been reported (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,344 to Atala, which is incorporated by reference herein; Atala et al. (1992) \nJ. Urol. \n148:658-62; Atala et al. (1993) \nJ. Urol. \n150:608-12). As an example, cells grown in culture can be trypsinized to separate the cells, and the separated cells can be seeded on the biodegradable scaffold. Alternatively, cells obtained from cell culture can be lifted from a culture plate as a cell layer, and the cell layer can be directly seeded onto the biodegradable scaffold without prior separation of the cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe density of cells seeded onto the scaffold can be varied. For example, in some embodiments greater cell densities promote greater tissue formation by the seeded cells, while lesser densities can permit relatively greater formation of tissue by cells infiltrating the graft from the host. Other seeding techniques can also be used depending on the biodegradable scaffold and the cells. For example, the cells can be applied to the biodegradable scaffold by vacuum filtration. Selection of cell types and seeding cells onto a biodegradable scaffold will be routine to one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further embodiments, formulations of the invention include those for parenteral administration (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal injection) or implantation. In some embodiments, administration is carried out intravascularly, either by simple injection, or by injection through a catheter positioned in a suitable blood vessel, such as a renal artery. In another embodiment, administration is carried out as a graft to an organ or tissue to be augmented, as discussed above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration include sterile liquid, preferably aqueous, injection compositions of the cells, which preparations may be isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations can also contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. The preparations are, apart from the cells being administered, sterile in the sense that they are free of microbial contaminants such as bacteria and viruses. The formulations can be in a synringeable, injectable form, can be in a form suitable for surgical implantation, or in any other form suitable for administration into the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to some embodiments, the cells administered to the subject can be syngeneic (i.e., isologous, including isogeneic and autogeneic), allogeneic (i.e., homologous) or xenogeneic (i.e., heterologous) with respect to the subject being treated, depending upon other steps such as the presence or absence of encapsulation or the administration of immune suppression therapy of the cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutically effective dosage of cells will vary somewhat from subject to subject, and will depend upon factors such as the age, weight, and condition of the subject and the route of delivery. Such dosages can be determined in accordance with procedures known to those skilled in the art. In general, in some embodiments, a dosage of 1×10\n5\n, 1×10\n6 \nor 5×10\n6 \nup to 1×10\n7\n, 1×10\n8 \nor 1×10\n9 \ncells or more per subject may be given, administered together at a single time or given as several subdivided administrations. In other embodiments a dosage of between 1−100×10\n8 \ncells per kilogram subject body weight can be given, administered together at a single time or given as several subdivided administrations. Of course, follow-up administrations may be given if necessary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor allogenic transplant into a patient, cells and/or tissues as described herein may be matched or tissue-typed in accordance with known techniques, and/or the subject may be administered immune suppressive agents to combat tissue transplant rejection, also in accordance with known techniques. If desired or necessary, the subject can also be administered an agent for inhibiting transplant rejection of the administered cells, such as rapamycin, azathioprine, corticosteroids, cyclosporin and/or FK506, in accordance with known techniques. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,461,058; 5,403,833; and 5,100,899; see also U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,455,518; 6,346,243; and 5,321,043.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, cells of the present invention can be transfected (e.g., with a specific gene) prior to seeding with genetic material. Useful genetic material may be, for example, genetic sequences that are capable of reducing or eliminating an immune response in the host. For example, the expression of cell surface antigens such as class I and class II histocompatibility antigens can be suppressed. This would allow the transplanted cells to have a reduced chance of rejection by the host.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKits for Collecting USC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKits are also provided herein for the collection of urine samples. Preferably kits according to the present invention serve to preserve the viability of urine stem cells during transport to a remote location (e.g., a suitable laboratory facility). In some embodiments, kits include a tube containing a suitable media (e.g., 1-15 mL, and in some \nembodiments\n 5 mL of a serum such as fetal bovine serum). The media may be provided frozen, to be thawed before use. In other embodiments, kits include a tube containing antibiotics (e.g., 1-15 mL, and in some \nembodiments\n 5 mL of a solution containing 1% penicillin and streptomycin). The antibiotics may be in powder form or in aqueous solution (optionally provided frozen, to be thawed before use).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKits may also include suitable containers (e.g., bottles) for the collection of urine samples (e.g., three sterile plastic bottles of a suitable volume, e.g., 100-1,000 mL, and in some embodiments 500 mL). Kits may also include alcohol swabs. In some embodiments cooling means such as ice bags, cold packs, etc., are included to keep urine cool at approximately 4° C. (e.g., 2 ice bags having dimensions of 3 inch×2 inch×0.5 inch). Further embodiments include a container that can hold the above listed components (e.g., a plastic box having dimensions of 6 inch tall×6 inch wide×7 inch long), and optionally also includes instructions for use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is explained in greater detail in the following non-limiting examples.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nIsolation and Characterization of Stem Cells from Urine\n\n\n \n \n \nFifty-eight human urine samples were collected from 22 male and one female donors (15 healthy individuals and 8 patients), ranging in age from 2 to 50 years. No bacterial contamination was found in any cultures. Urine samples were centrifuged at 1500 RPM for 5 minutes at 4° C. and washed two times with sterile PBS. Cells were plated at an average of 0.5 cell/well in multi-well plates with stem cell medium using a gradual dilution method. The stem cell medium contains ¾ DMEM, ¼ Ham's F12, 10% FBS, 0.4 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 10\n−10 \nM, Chron Toxin, 5 mg/ml, insulin, 1.2 mg/ml adenine, 2.5 mg/ml transferrin plus 0.136 mg/\nml\n 3,39,5-triiodo-L-thyronine, 10 mg/ml EGF, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Zhang et al., In vitro Cell Dev. Biol.-Animal 37:419, 2001). Single cells were identified and allowed to grow to more than 50% confluence. Cells were subsequently subcultured, transferred to a 6-cm culture dish and expanded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimary cell outgrowth was obtained in about 39% of the cultures initiated from urine samples. Average numbers of cells in the colony were 4.5/100 ml urine in healthy individuals on the second day (Table 1). The cells were small, brighter-looking cells that were most likely from the base layer of the bladder mucosa, and relatively undifferentiated based upon our experience with long-term observation (\nFIG. 1\n). A consistently high yield of urine cells was achieved from each clonal line. Cell doubling time of urine cells was 31.3 hours in a complex media with stem cell medium and KSFM (1:1). It took 10 to 12 days for urine cells from a single cell to reach confluence in a 6-cm culture dish (\nFIG. 2\n).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNumber of\n\n\nAverage of\n\n\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUrine\n\n\nClone #/100 ml\n\n\nof Colony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSamples\n\n\n \nUrine\n \n \nFormation\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 yrs or younger\n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n37% (7/17)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13-40 yrs old\n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n5.8\n\n\n50% (8/16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>40 yrs old\n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n38% (7/16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSources\n \n \n \n\n\nMorning Urine\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n50% (6/12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFresh Urine\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n65% (11/17)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStorage at 4° C.\n\n\n 4 \nhours\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n38% (3/8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 8 \nhours\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n17% (1/6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n24 \nhours\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n17% (1/6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo demonstrate molecular and cellular features of the urine cells, expression of stem cell-specific and differentiated cell-specific markers was analyzed.

Urine was found to contain urothelial stem cells and smooth muscle stem cells. These cells were confirmed with CD markers as indicated above. In addition, urothelial stem cell markers and smooth muscle cell markers were employed to further characterize these cells. Monoclonal antibodies against urothelial stem cell-specific markers, uroplakin Ia and \n \n \n \ncytokeratins\n \n \n \n 7, 13, 17, and 19, were applied at 70% cell confluence, at the following dilutions for each antibody: anti-cytokeratin 7, 1:200; anti-cytokeratin 13, 1:100; anti-cytokeratin 17, 1:100; and \nanti-cytokeratin\n 19, 1:100. The expression of uroplakin and the indicated cytokeratins in urine stem cells was determined and compared with the expression of the markers in cultured urothelium obtained from regular biopsy tissue (Zhang, et al.

The degree of immunofluorescence was defined as ranging from negative (−) to strongly positive (++++).

Methods for the collagen lattice contraction assay are known in the art (Kropp, et al. (1999) \nJ. Urol. \n162:1779). Contractile response to agonists is performed in a similar manner except that agonists are added to the serum-free media immediately prior to lattice release. Agonists which are tested include the Ca-ionophore A23187 (1025 M) and KCl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUrine-derived urothelial stem cells are analyzed for tight junctions. Urothelial barrier function is maintained by apical membrane plaques and intercellular tight junctions. Tight junction components within urine stem cells is investigated with conventional methods such as electric microscopy (Zhang, et al. (2003) \nAdv. Exp. Med. Biol. \n539:907; Ludwikowski, et al. (1999) \nBJU hit. \n84:507; Sugasi, et al. (2000) \nJ. Urol. \n164:951; Zhang, et al. (2001) \nIn Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. \n37:419; Cross, et al. (2005) \nAm. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. \n289:F459).\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nUrine Stem Cell Differentiation into Smooth Muscle Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine the effect of epithelial-stromal cell interaction or cell-cell interaction on urine stem cell differentiation into smooth muscle cells (Staack, et al. (2005) \nDifferentiation \n73:121; DiSandro, et al. (1998) \nJ. Urol. \n160:1040), two co-culture methods are used. The first is an indirect co-culture using transwell devices with a 4.5 μm size exclusion. Urine smooth muscle stem cells are plated on the upper chamber wells and bladder smooth muscle cells and/or urothelium from tissue biopsy are seeded on the bottom wells of a transwell unit (Luk, et al. (2005) \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n305:39; Gerstenfeld, et al. (2003) \nConnect Tissue Res. \n44(suppl 1):85). The second method is a direct co-culture approach which is performed with a transwell insert of 0.4 μm pore size. The transwell is used as a basement membrane on which urine stem cells are cultured on the lower side, while normal human bladder urothelium and smooth muscle cells are cultured on the opposite upper side (Le Visage, et al. 92004) \nTissue Eng. \n10:1426). The urine cells are subsequently evaluated through phenotypic appearance, molecular analysis and immunohistochemical staining for smooth muscle protein expression on \n \n \n \ndays\n \n \n \n 3, 7, 14, and 28 after cell seeding.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nScaffolds Seeded with Urine Stem Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nCell attachment, proliferation and differentiation of urine stem cells on bladder submucosa membrane (BSM) and small intestine submucosa (SIS) was evaluated to determine the cell-matrix interaction for clinical application. In in vitro cell-seeded constructs, urine stem cell-derived urothelium was seeded on the BSM mucosal side and urine stem cell-derived smooth muscle cells on the serosa side placed in the presence of mixed media (KSFM:DMEM, 1:1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubsequently, the seeded matrices were implanted subcutaneously into athymic mice. The implanted engineered tissues were retrieved and assessed via histochemistry (H&E and Trichrom), immunohistochemistry (cytokeratin and smooth muscle cell-specific markers), western blot analyses, and human X/Y chromosome detection assay (FISH). For histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis, engineered tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin, using standard procedures. Five-mm sections were cut and mounted. Routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Masson's trichrome staining were performed. Immunohistochemical staining was also performed using monoclonal antibodies against smooth muscle cell proteins, alpha-smooth muscle actin (diluted 1:1000), desmin (1:20), calponin (1:50) and myosin (1:100) and against urothelial cell-specific protein, cytokeratin \nAE\n 1/AE3 (1:100 antibody dilution) (Zhang, et al. (2005) \nBJU Int. \n96:1120; Zhang, et al. (2003) \nAdv. Exp. Med. Biol. \n539:907; Zhang, et al. (2000) \nJ. Urol. \n164:928; Zhang, et al. (2006) \nBJU Int. \n98:1100; Zhang, et al. (2004) \nTissue Eng. \n10:181; Zhang, et al. (2001) \nIn Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. \n37:419).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProteins for western blot analysis were isolated by lysing cells or the cell-seeded scaffold tissue with a lysis buffer according to known methods (Zhang, et al. (2005) \nBJU Int. \n96:1120; Lin, et al. (2004) \nJ. Urol. \n171:1348). Mouse anti-human alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin, myosin, and AE1/AE3 were used as the primary antibody and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody. The presence of protein bands was detected by a commercially available enhanced chemiluminescence assay kit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUrine stem cells were noted in the graft tissues with LacZ staining one month after implantation. The implanted cells were also confirmed by human X/Y chromosome. Advantageously, urine stem cells formed multilayered urothelial cells and smooth muscle-like tissue structures within the scaffolds in vivo (\nFIG. 6\n). Furthermore, no tumor was observed in the graft tissues three months after implantation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese data therefore provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that cells obtained from urine can serve as a source for tissue engineering and cell therapy applications. Urine stem cells are readily available, and it has been shown that they proliferate and differentiate into urothelium and smooth muscle in vitro. Bladder cells derived from urine stem cells show urothelium and smooth muscle-like phenotypes including expressing urothelium and smooth muscle-specific proteins, respectively. Collagen matrix supports the three-dimensional growth of urine stem cells, which is a basic requirement for bladder reconstruction. In vivo urine stem cells-seeded scaffolds provide a cost-effective method for bladder reconstruction.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nOsteogenic Differentiation of Human Urine Stem Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nTraditional approaches for treatment of bone defects caused by injury or disease rely on the presence of osteo-stem cells at the site of injury. In cases where these osteo-stem cells are compromised, other cell sources are required for cell-based therapy. We have identified such a cell source in human urine. The studies described in the examples above demonstrated that urine stem cells (USC) possess the potential to differentiate into bladder cell lineages (\nFIG. 7\n) and these cells may be able to differentiate into other cell types, including bone cells. Successful generation of bone cells from urine would circumvent other expensive methods of sourcing autologous cells and would be a simple, cost effective and safe method for collecting cells for bone therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThirty-one urine samples were collected from six healthy individuals and USC were isolated and expanded from these samples as described in the examples above. USC were plated on laminin coated dishes and cultured in KSFM/EFM (1:1) media until 80% confluency was achieved. USC at \npassage\n 3 were used for cell differentiation. To induce osteogenic differentiation, osteogenic media (DMEM containing dexamethasone, β-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid) was added and media was changed every 2-3 days. The treated USC were assayed for expression of bone markers (osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase and p-microglobulin) by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining on \nday\n 28. Non-induced USC were used as negative control and human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells as positive control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunohistochemical staining using Alizarin Red S dye showed that USC produced \ncalcium\n 28 days after treatment with osteogenic media, as seen by the intense red foci on the top right panel of \nFIG. 11\n. The control did not stain for calcium. In addition, treated USC expressed alkaline phosphatase (ALP-2), which bone cells require for calcium deposition. Intense purple staining of the induced cells was seen (\nFIG. 11\n). RT-PCR performed on USC induced with osteogenic media for 28 days showed expression of highly specific bone-related transcripts only with the osteogenic treatment. Control USC cells and -RT control showed no amplification of these transcripts (\nFIG. 12\n)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUPCs can be induced to differentiate into bone-like cells by using media containing osteogenic supplements. The induced cells secrete calcium and synthesize alkaline phosphatase as seen in normal bone cells. We conclude that USC may be used for bone regeneration.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nUrine Stem Cells Show Multipotency\n\n\n \n \n \nHistorically, efforts to isolate cells from urine, presumably originating in the bladder and perhaps the kidney and ureters, met with poor success. However, we herein describe conditions under which urine stem cells can be expanded from essentially any individual. As shown in the Examples above, we have successfully isolated stem cells from human urine (see also PCT Application No. PCT/US2008/006438, published as WO 2008/153685, which is incorporated by reference herein). We demonstrated a reproducible harvest, isolation and in vitro expansion of USC and differentiation of USC into bladder smooth muscle cells (SMC) and urothelium in culture, as well as osteogenic differentiation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBelow, we demonstrate differentiation of USC into multiple cell lineages characteristic of MSCs. We have, therefore, termed the cells urine stem cells (USC) due to their mesenchymal stem cell-like phenotype and ability to differentiate into multiple cell lineages. (This is a change from the urine progenitor cells (UPC) terminology used in PCT Application No. PCT/US2008/006438.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe observed that the major population of cells collected from urine are terminally differentiated urothelium and do not attach well to tissue culture plastic. Some other cells attach but show limited growth. However, we consistently found that small numbers of cells were able to grow as colonies that continued to expand and could be passaged multiple times. By initially plating samples in multi-well dishes (24 or 96 wells), we found that individual urine-derived cells can be grown immediately as cell clones. The cells capable of such clonal growth are those we term urine-derived stem cells (USC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe USC are small, compact, diploid cells. They typically show a doubling time of 31.3 hours in the stem cell medium we developed and described in Example 1 above. In 10-12 days, a single cell can be expanded to reach confluence in a 3.5-cm culture dish. The cells can then be subcultured multiple times. In general, we have found that individual clones can be expanded to 10\n6\n-10\n7 \ncells (or about 20-25 population doublings [pd] from an initial cell harvested from urine) while maintaining marker expression and their ability to differentiate. Although we can finally obtain as many as 1×10\n9 \ncells from a clone (about 30 pd), growth slows and the cells spread and become flattened, and no longer differentiate well. These growth parameters are roughly comparable to those typically described in the literature for MSCs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe reported that fresh urine obtained from urination yielded 4.5-7.2 USC clones per 100 ml urine, depending on time of day. The yield from urine obtained by catheterization was at least 4-fold greater. Storage of urine for more than 4 hours was deleterious to the recovery of viable colony-forming cells. We noted a possible trend for urine of younger subjects (under age 13) to give a slightly lower yield of USC than for older subjects. However, this did not reach statistical significance. Overall, we obtained clones from about 40-50% of samples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe now obtain USC clones from more than 90% of urine samples by the following modifications of the collection procedure: 1) After mid and last stream urine was collected, urine sample is centrifuged and cell pellets washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% FBS. 2) If urine is clear, urine sample is centrifuged and then cells are plated on culture dishes directly. We found that PBS wash decreases the rate of cell colony formation and survival. The best way is to avoid to wash cells with pure PBS. If urine has to be washed, culture medium or PBS with 5% serum is recommended. In the rare cases where clones are not obtained, collection of a repeat sample from the same individual usually succeeds.\n\n\n \nA. Stem Cell Surface Makers on USC\n\n\n \n \n \nWe used monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry (FACS) to assess markers expressed by human USC (Table 1, supra Example 1). Three independent clones gave similar results. A high percentage of cells initially expressed markers shared with MSCs, including CD44 (also a marker for basal cells of the bladder mucosa), CD73, CD90, and CD105. Expression of most of these markers was maintained as cells were expanded to \npassage\n 4. Hematopoietic and endothelial lineage markers (CD31, CD34, CD45) were not expressed. SSEA4 was expressed by about 75% of cells. This glycolipid antigen is a marker of human ES cells, and also of long-lived, broadly multipotent stem cells from human amniotic fluid previously described (see De Coppi et al. (2007) Nature Biotechnology 25(1):100-6; PCT Application WO 03/042405 to Atala and DeCoppi). However, SSEA4 also is expressed by MSCs under certain culture conditions. Markers associated with other stem cells, namely CD117 and CD133, were detected on small percentages of cells.\n\n\n \nB. Urothelial Differentiation of USC\n\n\n \n \n \nWhen USC were cultured in keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM) containing epidermal growth factor (EGF) and low calcium (0.09 mM), the cells were induced to express proteins characteristic of differentiated urothelium. These included cytokeratins (CK7, CK13, CK19) and uroplakin Ia, assessed by immunofluorescence, western immunoblotting, and FACS analysis (\nFIG. 3\n).\n\n\n \nC. Smooth Muscle Cell Differentiation of USC\n\n\n \n \n \nUSC also were capable of being induced to express markers consistent with the smooth muscle cell (SMC) lineage. Culturing in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and myogenic growth factors (TGF-β1+PDGF-BB) induced a change in morphology from cobblestone to an elongated spindle shape. Decellularized bladder matrix somewhat enhanced the change, but only in the presence of the myogenic factors. We found that non-induced USC also express detectable levels of several SMC markers (especially a-smooth muscle actin [αSMA] and calponin, along with low levels of desmin and myosin), as judged by immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence. Expression of the muscle markers increased markedly over 1-2 weeks of exposure to myogenic medium. However, desmin and αSMA levels did not reach those seen with authentic bladder SMC from tissue biopsies. Note that expression of low levels of αSMA and desmin also is characteristic of uninduced MSCs and pericytes.\n\n\n \nD. Multipotency of Cloned USC\n\n\n \n \n \nThe similarities in surface marker phenotype and gene expression led us to ask whether USC can differentiate to lineages typical for MSCs. We tested USC cell clones obtained from 11 independent donors. USC could be induced to express markers typical of the osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic lineages, using differentiation protocols that have been employed routinely with MSCs, and were used previously by members of our Institute associated with this application to assess the differentiation capacity of amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (see De Coppi et al. (2007) Nature Biotechnology 25(1):100-6; PCT Application WO 03/042405 to Atala and DeCoppi, incorporated by reference herein). The results of immunohistochemical staining (\nFIG. 13A-F\n) and transcript analysis by RT-PCR (\nFIG. 13G-I\n) were consistent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifferentiation of USC to adipocyte-like cells. Adipogenic induction. Cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells/cm\n2 \nand culture in DMEM low-glucose medium with 10% FBS, antibiotics (Pen/Strep, Gibco/BRL), and adipogenic supplements (1 mM dexamethasone, 500 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 10 mg/ml insulin, 100 mM indomethacin (Sigma-Aldrich)) for 21 days with media changes every third day. Adipogenic differentiation was assessed by Oil Red O staining (\nFIG. 13A\n) and RT-PCR for the transcription factor PPARγ and lipoprotein lipase (LpL) (\nFIG. 13G\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifferentiation of USC to cartilage-like cells. Chondrogenic induction. \nPellet\n 3×10\n5 \ncells in 0.5 ml of DMEM low glucose medium with antibiotics (Pen/Strep) and chondrogenic supplements (100 nM dexamethasone, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid phosphate, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml selenium, 100 μg/ml sodium pyruvate, 40 μg/ml proline, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 ng/ml TGF-133) a sterile 15 ml conical polypropylene tube by centrifuging at 600 g for 5 min. Tubes were placed in the cell culture incubator with the caps loosened to permit gas exchange. The sedimented cells formed a spherical mass of cells and floated on the media within 24 h. Media was replaced every three for 21 days. Alcian Blue and Toluidine Blue staining of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) indicated chondrogenic differentiation of USC induced with TGF-β3(\nFIG. 13B\n, C). RT-PCR of control USC (lane 1) and USC induced with TGF-β3 (lane 2) confirmed induction of chondrogenic lineage markers Sox9, collagen II and aggrecan (\nFIG. 13H\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifferentiation of USC to osteocyte-like cells. Osteogenic induction. Cells were seeded at a density of 4,000 cells/cm\n2 \nand culture in DMEM low-glucose medium with 10% FBS (FBS, Gibco/BRL), antibiotics (Pen/Strep, Gibco/BRL), and osteogenic supplements (100 nM dexamethasone, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.05 mM ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (Wako Chemicals, Irving, Tex.). USC induced in osteogenic medium differentiated towards bone, as judged by several histochemical stains (FIG. \n13\nD-F)—von Kossa for mineralized bone, alkaline phosphatase, and Alizarin Red for calcium deposition. RT-PCR confirmed induction of the osteogenic markers osteocalcin, Runx2 and alkaline phosphatase (\nFIG. 13I\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifferentiation of USC to endothelial-like cells. Endothelial induction. Cells were seeded at 3,000 cells/cm\n2 \non plastic plates precoated with 0.1% gelatin and maintain in culture for 1 month in endothelial cell medium-2 (EGM™-2, Clonetics; Cambrex Bioproducts) supplemented with 10% FBS, and Pen/Strep. Add Recombinant human bFGF (StemCell Technologies) at intervals of 2 d at 2 ng/ml. USC cultured for 4 weeks in endothelial differentiation medium were induced to express the endothelial cell markers vWF and CD 31 (\nFIG. 14\n), and levels of expression, judged by immunofluorescent staining, were comparable to those for human umbilical vessel endothelial cells.\n\n\n \n \nE. Karyotype analysis of USC\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKaryotype analysis was performed to test the genetic stability of USC after serial culture (up to passage 6). At all passages of the three cell strains, analyzed karyograms showed a normal diploid (2n=38) complement of autosomes, and XY sex chromosomes (donors were male). No obvious chromosomal rearrangements could be detected by Giemsa banding of metaphase chromosomes.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nDetection of Telomerase in USC\n\n\n \n \n \nThe enzyme telomerase maintains telomere length in proliferating cells. It is expressed by embryonic stem cells and some adult stem cells. Our data indicates that six of seven (6/7) independent clones of USC from different individuals (\nages\n 5 to 40 years in this set) have detectable levels of telomerase (at passages 3-6), compared to the negative control (heat-denatured lysate) (\nFIG. 15\n). By contrast, the level of telomerase protein in a commercial preparation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from human bone marrow and in conventionally cultured smooth muscle cells (SMC) from human bladder were not significantly above background. Levels in two clones were similar to that in a transformed positive control cell line (HEK-293). The data are consistent with the proposed stem cell character of USC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLong telomere length and high telomerase activity are associated with cell self-renewal and cells that can be cultured long term for many passages. The presence of telomerase suggests that USC can be maintained for a high number of population doublings.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nTelomere Length and Telomerase Activity\n\n\nA Telomere Length\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is well known that a critical length of telomere repeat is required to ensure proper telomere function and to prevent the activation of DNA damage pathways that lead to replicative senescence and cell death. In addition, telomere length is crucial in preventing chromosomal end-to-end fusion and recombination during cell proliferation. Whenever somatic cells divide, some terminal telomere sequence is lost, so that proliferative capacity ultimately is limited both in vivo and in vitro. However, some non-embryonic stem cells and tissue-specific progenitor cells have at least a limited ability to restore telomere length and are therefore less limited in proliferative capacity. This reduced rate of telomere length loss is thought to be due to the presence of some telomerase activity in these cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe average telomere length of the USC is measured and compared with that of somatic cells obtained from the same individuals at the time of stem cell isolation. The rate of telomere repeat loss during cell expansion and differentiation is also measured. Human embryonal carcinoma cells (NTERA-2) are be used as a positive control for telomerase activity and long telomere length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTelomere length can be determined by established methods. One can use the Telo TTAGGG telomere length assay kit supplied by Roche. DNA (0.5 μg) is digested with the restriction enzymes Hinf I and Rsa I and separated by electrophoresis at 80 volts in 0.8% agarose gel. Subsequently, the DNA in the gel is transferred to a “hybond” membrane (Amersham, UK) by Southern blot. Terminal restriction fragments are detected by hybridization to digoxigenin-labeled telomeric oligonucleotide following the Roche protocol. Mean telomere length can be determined using Sigma Gel Software.\n\n\n \nB. Telomerase Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nTelomerase is the enzyme primarily responsible for maintaining telomere length in germ cells, ES cells, and cancer stem cells and immortal cancer cells. Somatic cells have low or undetectable levels of telomerase activity, whereas post-embryonic stem cells have moderate levels of telomerase activity which may be up-regulated when these cells differentiate into tissue-specific progenitor cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTelomerase activity is determined in low passage, high passage, and differentiating USC. Induced differentiation pathways tested are those of smooth muscle, urothelium, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and endothelium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTelomerase activity can be determined using the Telo ATGGG PCR ELISA\nPLUS \nkit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells (2×10\n5 \nper sample) are lysed in 200 μl Chaps buffer, and 0.5 μg of proteinaceous supernatant will be used for PCR reaction in a total volume of 50 μl. Telomerase activity is calculated relative to the ELISA signal obtained from the control reagents supplied with the kit. A 20 μl sample of the PCR product is subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% acrylamide gel and analyzed by Southern blotting to confirm the presence of a telomerase-mediated six nucleotide DNA ladder using a Biotin Luminescent Detection kit from Roche.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the USC originate from bladder urothelium, we would expect these cells to follow the telomerase expression pattern typically displayed by somatic stem cells. Namely, detectable levels of telomerase activity should be present during stem cell proliferation, with up-regulation of telomerase activity during early stages of differentiation into somatic tissues (progenitor cells) and a gradual loss of telomerase activity as the differentiation pathway proceeds to mature somatic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine the relationship between ratio of expression of CD146\n+\n and high higher telomerase activity in USC, the ratio of CD146\n+\n in USC is analyzed with higher telomerase activity versus USC with low telomerase activity.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nMarkers of Perivascular Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nThough not wishing to be bound by theory, it is hypothesized that USC may derive from perivascular cells (also called pericyte) related to MSC. Our data documents the expression of several markers of MSC/pericytes: CD146 (MCAM) by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR; NG2 (a related antigen), and PDGF-Receptorβ (PDGF-Rβ) by RT-PCR (\nFIG. 16\n). The data are consistent with the hypothesis that at least some USC are MSC-like cells that may derive from perivascular cells in the bladder. Note that, even within a clone, the expression of CD146 was not uniform at an early passage, indicating that some spontaneous differentiation may occur under present culture conditions.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nCharacterization of Smooth Muscle Cells Differentiated from USC\n\n\n \n \n \nUrine stem cells (USC) were differentiated into smooth muscle cells (SMC) and characterized. Thirty-one urine samples were collected from 6 healthy individuals, centrifuged and re-suspended in KSFM/EFM (1:1) media. Cells were plated in 24 well dishes. Single colonies (p0) were transferred to 6 well plates (p1) and further to a 10 cm plate (p2). USC from \npassage\n 3 were used for cell differentiation studies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNo bacterial contamination was found in any of the urine samples. USC comprised an average of 10 cells/100 ml (ranging from 6 to 14 cells/100 ml). At passage-3, USC could expand to one million cells in about 3-4 weeks. Cells treated with growth factors displayed spindle-shaped architecture on 14d.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo induce UPC differentiation into SMC, cells were either treated with growth factors (TGF-β at 2.5 ng/ml and PDGF-BB at 5 ng/ml) or cultured on individual bio-matrix coatings of collagen IV (Col IV), laminin (Lam), bladder muscle cellular matrix (BMT) or acellular matrix (ECM). In addition, some USC were co-cultured with bladder SMC or in SMC-derived conditional medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe treated UPC were assayed for expression of SMC markers (Desmin, Myosin, Calponin) by RT-PCR, Western Blot and immunofluorescence on \n \nday\n \n 7 and 14. Bladder SMC served as a positive control and urothelial cells served as a negative control. RT-PCR performed on RNA isolated 7 and 14 days after growth factors or conditional medium addition, indicated expression of most of the transcript. However, myosin expression specifically increased only when growth factor was added (\nFIG. 17\n). Protein data correlated very well with the gene expression data with RT-PCR data (\nFIG. 18\n). The USC treated with growth factors, co-culture with SMC or SMC-conditioned media expressed smooth muscle specific proteins such as desmin and myosin. Immunofluorescence experiments also correlated with the gene and protein expression data, and expression of smooth muscle-specific proteins increased in a time-dependent manner (data not shown). Bio-matrices alone failed to induce USC to express SMC-specific transcript or proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOur data supports the potential of the stem cells to be induced to differentiate to functional SMC when incubated for 14 days in medium containing the myogenic growth factors (GF), i.e. TGF-β1 and PDGF-BB. One method by which to assess the functionality of SMC differentiated from USC is to determine their ability to mechanically contract lattices fabricated from collagen type I. Cell contractility of treated USC was assessed with a contractile agonist (calcium ionophore). The growth factor-treated cells were assessed for contractile function after days of incubation in the collagen lattice. The extent of contraction after release of the stabilized lattice was measured, and reflects the muscle function of the cells. The data show that USC differentiated with TGF-β1 and PDGF-BB (USC+GF) were closely comparable to authentic bladder SMC in their contractile function (\nFIG. 19\n).\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nUSC Seeded Bacterial Cellulose Polymer for Urinary Conduit\n\n\n \n \n \nPorous bacterial cellulose polymer provides 3D growth of USC with multilayer of urothelium formation and cell-matrix infiltration. Bacterial cellulose (BC) polymer is a highly hydrophilic, biocompatible, non-degradable and FDA approved material with reliable mechanical properties and the stability within a wide range of temperatures and pH levels. The objective of this study is to fabricate a tissue engineered conduit with cell seeded bacterial cellulose construct for urinary reconstruction and diversion in the treatment of patients with this end-stage bladder diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPorous bacterial cellulose matrixes were prepared by adding sterile paraffin particles of different size ranges: 90-150 μm, 150-300 μm and 300-500 μm, into the tubular fermentation vessel of \nAcetobacter xylinum\n. Human urine derived stem cells (USC) collected from the upper urinary tract were induced to differentiate into urothelium and smooth muscle cells (SMC) with epidermal and myogenic growth factors (TGF-β and PDGF), respectively. Human ureter urothelium and SMC were used as control. Ureter urothelium and SMC were seeded on BC polymer with co-culture (Group 1) or mono-(Group 2) fashions. Non-induced USC (Group 3) or co-culture of induced urothelium derived from USC (UC-USC) and SMC derived from USC (SMC-USC) were seeded on the matrix (Group 4) at 10\n6 \ncells/cm\n2 \nat static and in 3D dynamic culture at 10 or 40 RPM up to 14 days. Cell-seeded BC polymers were implanted in an athymic mouse model for one month. The implanted cells were tracked on cell-seeded BC grafts by using immunohistochemical labeling for human nuclear antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe USC grew on the BC matrix surface, and infiltrated the matrix to larger extent when grown at 10 rpm on \nday\n 14. Urothelium-USC formed multilayers, and more SMC-USC infiltrated into BC matrix in layered co-culture (Group 4) compared to those in mono culture of urothelium-USC (Group 3). The same outcomes were seen on co-culture of ureter urothelium and SMC (Group 1) vs. culture of the urothelium alone (Group 2). No differences in cell growth and matrix infiltration among three BC matrixes with different pore sizes. Urothelium-USC lined on the BC matrix expressed urothelium markers (uroplakin I and AE1/AE3) and SMC-USC expressed SMC markers (a-smooth muscle actin and desmin) in \nGroup\n 4 seven days after culture in vitro. Cell-free BC matrixes were attached with fine fibrous tissue and did not provoke inflammatory reaction in vivo. The human implanted USC were found in the grafts, and maintained urothelial and SMC phenotypes in vivo for one month.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nTreatment of SUI and VUR with Urine Stem Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nExamples described above demonstrate that USC possess progenitor/stem cell characteristics and can differentiate into mesoderm cell lineages such as adipocyte, osteocyte, chondrocyte, smooth muscle cells, interstitial cells and other cell types. We assessed whether human urine-derived stem cells (USC) can be used as a potential cell source for cell therapy in regenerative repair of muscular tissue defect for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwenty urine samples were collected from 9 healthy individuals. USC were isolated and expanded in vitro. Cells were identified with pericyte/mesenchymal stem cell markers. Urine derived cells (5×10\n5 \ncells, p3) were mixed with 0.5 ml of collagen type I (3 mg/ml) and injected subcutaneously into athymic mouse model. Implants of smooth muscle cells (SMC) mixed with collagen I were used as positive control and the cell-free collagen gel as negative control. The implants were retrieved and analyzed by histology and \nimmunocytochemistry\n 14 days after injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNo bacterial contamination was found in any of the urine samples. About 4 single urine derived cells/100 ml (ranging from 2 to 6 cells/100 ml) were found. Each single cell could expand to one million cells at \npassage\n 3 in about 3-4 weeks. Cells were positive for pericyte/mesenchymal stem cells markers (CD146, CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, SSEA-4) and negative for hematopoietic stem cell markers (CD34, CD31 and CD45). USC presented high telomerase activity in 6 of 7 individual urine samples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSizes of cells-collagen implants were significantly larger than that of cell-free collagen implants, but no different in implant sizes between USC-collagen and SMC-collagen implants. Cells expressed smooth muscle markers α-smooth muscle actin and desmin in USC-collagen and SMC-collagen implants, but not in cell-free collagen implants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults of different treatment groups are presented in Table 5 below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSmooth\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGraft\n\n\nCell\n\n\nmuscle\n\n\nInterstitial\n\n\nNew\n\n\nNerve\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColl Gel\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nNumber\n\n\ncells\n\n\nCells\n\n\nVessels\n\n\nFibro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCell-free\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n−\n\n\n−\n\n\n−\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSC\n\n\n+\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n−\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSC-VEGF\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSC-\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVEGF + EC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSC + EC\n\n\n+\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSC + Coll-\n\n\n+\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVEGF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSC + EC +\n\n\n+\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColl-VEGF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen USC were transfected with a VEFG gene (VEGF-USC), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUCEC) mixed with collagen type I gel, the number of transfected cells significantly increased compared to the non-transfected cells.

Rich capillary formation was observed and innervations with nerve fiber formation within the graft with VEFG-USC plus HUCEC-collagen I gel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis study demonstrated that human USC can be isolated for cell expansion by a simple, safe, noninvasive and low-cost procedure.

Description\n\n\n\n\nPRIORITY TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims the benefit of European Patent Application No. 08172314.0, filed Dec. 19, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to an anti-IGF-1R human monoclonal antibody formulation, a process for the preparation of said formulation and uses thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention relates to an IGF-1R antibody formulation comprising:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nabout 20 to about 60 mg/mL huMAb-IGF-1R,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nabout 5 to about 50 mM of a buffer,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nat a pH in the range from about 4.5 to about 7.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IGF-IR (type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor), has been implicated in promoting oncogenic transformation, growth, and survival of cancer cells. High levels of expression of IGF-IR have been reported in a broad range of human malignancies. In addition, high levels of IGF-I and IGF-II expression have been noted in tumors and associated stromal cells and may stimulate cancer cell growth in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Epidemiological studies have correlated upper quintile plasma levels of IGF-I with increased risk for prostate, colon, lung, and breast cancer. In addition to its role in proliferation of cancer cells, IGF-IR protects cells from apoptosis caused by growth factor deprivation, anchorage independence, or cytotoxic drug treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne promising strategy to inhibit the function of IGF-IR in cancer cells is to apply human anti-IGF-IR antibodies that bind to the extracellular domains of IGF-IR and inhibit receptor activation. Such an antagonistic, fully human, monoclonal antibody, designated huMAb-IGF-1R, has been developed which binds specifically to the human insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) and inhibits signal transduction and the proliferation functions of the receptor in cancer cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody comprised in the formulation of the invention has been first described in PCT patent application No. WO2005/005635 of which the Applicant is proprietor and the content of which, especially the claims is incorporated herein by reference. As described in WO2005/005635, said antibody is binding to IGF-IR and inhibiting the binding of IGF-I and IGF-II to IGF-IR, and is characterized in that it:\n\n \n \n \na) is of IgG1 isotype,\n \nb) shows a ratio of IC\n50 \nvalues of inhibition of the binding of IGF-I to IGF-IR to the inhibition of binding of IGF-II to IGF-IR of 1:3 to 3:1,\n \nc) inhibits for at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, at a concentration of 5 nM IGF-IR phosphorylation in a cellular phosphorylation assay using HT29 cells in a medium containing 0.5% heat inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) when compared to such an assay without said antibody, and\n \nd) shows no IGF-IR stimulating activity measured as pkB phosphorylation at a concentration of 10 μM in a cellular phosphorylation assay using 3T3 cells providing 400,000 to 600,000 molecules IGF-IR per cell in a medium containing 0.5% heat inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) when compared to such an assay without said antibody.\n \n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n shows the effect of changing pH and temperature on HMW soluble aggregates in formulations of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n shows the effect of changing pH and temperature on LMW fragments in formulations of the invention.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies comprised in the formulation according to the invention show benefits for patients in need of antitumor therapy and provide reduction of tumor growth and a significant prolongation of the time to progression. The antibodies comprised in the formulation according to the invention have new and inventive properties causing a benefit for a patient suffering from a disease associated with an IGF deregulation, especially a tumor disease. The antibodies comprised in the formulation of the invention are characterized by the abovementioned properties. The properties are therefore especially specific binding to IGF-IR, inhibiting the binding of IGF-I and IGF-II to IGF-IR at the abovementioned ratio, being of IgG1 isotype, and not activating the IGF-IR signaling even in IGF-IR overexpressing cells at a 200-fold concentration of its IC\n50 \nvalue. Antibodies having no “IGF-I mimetic activity” provide a strong advantage when used as a therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “about” denotes a minor±variability. In general, it is meant to denote a variability of 0.5% to 2%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “anti-IGF-1R human monoclonal antibody” or “huMAb IGF-IR” denotes an antibody as described and claimed in WO2005/005635, the content of which, especially the claims, is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antibody” encompasses the various forms of antibodies including but not being limited to whole antibodies, human antibodies, humanized antibodies and genetically engineered antibodies like monoclonal antibodies, chimeric antibodies or recombinant antibodies as well as fragments of such antibodies as long as the characteristic properties according to the invention are retained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Antibody fragments” comprise a portion of a full length antibody, generally at least the antigen binding portion or the variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include diabodies, single-chain antibody molecules, immunotoxins, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. In addition, antibody fragments comprise single chain polypeptides having the characteristics of a VH chain, namely being able to assemble together with a VL chain or of a VL chain binding to IGF-1R, namely being able to assemble together with a VH chain to a functional antigen binding pocket and thereby providing the property of inhibiting the binding of IGF-I and IGF-II to IGF-IR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Antibody fragments” also comprises such fragments which per se are not able to provide effector functions (ADCC/CDC) but provide this function in a manner according to the invention after being combined with appropriate antibody constant domain(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “monoclonal antibody” or “monoclonal antibody composition” as used herein refer to a preparation of antibody molecules of a single amino acid composition. Accordingly, the term “human monoclonal antibody” refers to antibodies displaying a single binding specificity which have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In one embodiment, the human monoclonal antibodies are produced by a hybridoma which includes a B cell obtained from a transgenic non-human animal, e.g. a transgenic mouse, having a genome comprising a human heavy chain transgene and a light human chain transgene fused to an immortalized cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “chimeric antibody” refers to a monoclonal antibody comprising a variable region, i.e., binding region, from one source or species and at least a portion of a constant region derived from a different source or species, usually prepared by recombinant DNA techniques. Chimeric antibodies comprising a murine variable region and a human constant region are especially preferred. Such murine/human chimeric antibodies are the product of expressed immunoglobulin genes comprising DNA segments encoding murine immunoglobulin variable regions and DNA segments encoding human immunoglobulin constant regions. Other forms of “chimeric antibodies” encompassed by the present invention are those in which the class or subclass has been modified or changed from that of the original antibody. Such “chimeric” antibodies are also referred to as “class-switched antibodies.” Methods for producing chimeric antibodies involve conventional recombinant DNA and gene transfection techniques now well known in the art. See, e.g., Morrison, S. L., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 (1984) 6851-6855; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,202,238 and 5,204,244.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “humanized antibody” refers to antibodies in which the framework or “complementarity determining regions” (CDR) have been modified to comprise the CDR of an immunoglobulin of different specificity as compared to that of the parent immunoglobulin. In a preferred embodiment, a murine CDR is grafted into the framework region of a human antibody to prepare the “humanized antibody.” See, e.g., Riechmann, L., et al., Nature 332 (1988) 323-327; and Neuberger, M. S., et al., Nature 314 (1985) 268-270. Particularly preferred CDRs correspond to those representing sequences recognizing the antigens noted above for chimeric and bifunctional antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “human antibody”, as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The variable heavy chain is preferably derived from germline sequence DP-50 (GenBank L06618) and the variable light chain is preferably derived from germline sequence L6 (GenBank X01668). The constant regions of the antibody are constant regions of human IgG1 type. Such regions can be allotypic and are described by, e.g., Johnson, G., and Wu, T. T., Nucleic Acids Res. 28 (2000) 214-218 and the databases referenced therein and are useful as long as the properties of induction of ADCC and preferably CDC according to the invention are retained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “recombinant human antibody”, as used herein, is intended to include all human antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies isolated from a host cell such as an SP2-0, NS0 or CHO cell or from an animal (e.g. a mouse) that is transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes or antibodies expressed using a recombinant expression vector transfected into a host cell. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences in a rearranged form. The recombinant human antibodies according to the invention have been subjected to in vivo somatic hypermutation. Thus, the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline VH and VL sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “binding to IGF-IR” as used herein means the binding of the antibody to IGF-IR in an in vitro assay, preferably in a binding assay in which the antibody is bound to a surface and binding of IGF-IR is measured by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Binding means a binding affinity (K\nD\n) of 10\n−8 \nM or less, preferably 10\n−13 \nto 10\n−9 \nM. The binding affinity is determined with a standard binding assay, such as surface plasmon resonance technique (Biacore®).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “nucleic acid molecule”, as used herein, is intended to include DNA molecules and RNA molecules. A nucleic acid molecule may be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “constant domains” are not involved directly in binding the antibody to an antigen but are involved in the effector functions (ADCC, complement binding, and CDC). The constant domain of an antibody according to the invention is of the IgG1 type. Human constant domains having these characteristics are described in detail by Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991), and by Brüggemann, M., et al., J. Exp. Med. 166 (1987) 1351-1361; Love, T. W., et al., Methods Enzymol. 178 (1989) 515-527. Examples are shown in SEQ ID NOS:5 to 8 in WO2005/005635. Other useful and preferred constant domains are the constant domains of the antibodies obtainable from the hybridoma cell lines deposited with DSMZ for this invention. The constant domains useful in the invention provide complement binding. ADCC and optionally CDC are provided by the combination of variable and constant domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “variable region” (variable region of a light chain (VL), variable region of a heavy chain (VH)) as used herein denotes each of the pair of light and heavy chains which is involved directly in binding the antibody to the antigen. The domains of variable human light and heavy chains have the same general structure and each domain comprises four framework (FR) regions whose sequences are widely conserved, connected by three “hypervariable regions” (or complementarity determining regions, CDRs). The framework regions adopt a β-sheet conformation and the CDRs may form loops connecting the β-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held in their three-dimensional structure by the framework regions and form together with the CDRs from the other chain the antigen binding site. The antibody heavy and light chain CDR3 regions play a particularly important role in the binding specificity/affinity of the antibodies according to the invention and therefore provide a further object of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “hypervariable region” or “antigen-binding portion of an antibody” when used herein refer to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from the “complementarity determining regions” or “CDRs”. “Framework” or “FR” regions are those variable domain regions other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined. Therefore, the light and heavy chains of an antibody comprise from N— to C-terminus the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4. Especially, CDR3 of the heavy chain is the region which contributes most to antigen binding. CDR and FR regions are determined according to the standard definition of Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)) and/or those residues from a “hypervariable loop”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding to IGF-IR can be investigated by a BIAcore assay (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The affinity of the binding is defined by the terms ka (rate constant for the association of the antibody from the antibody/antigen complex), kd (dissociation constant), and K\nD \n(kd/ka). The antibodies according to the invention show a K\nD \nof 10\n−10 \nM or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding of IGF-I and IGF-II to IGF-IR is also inhibited by the antibodies according to the invention. The inhibition is measured as IC\n50 \nin an assay for binding of IGF-I/IGF-II to IGF-IR on tumor cells. In such an assay, the amount of radiolabeled IGF-I or IGF-II or IGF-IR binding fragments thereof bound to the IGF-IR provided at the surface of said tumor cells (e.g. HT29) is measured without and with increasing concentrations of the antibody. The IC\n50 \nvalues of the antibodies according to the invention for the binding of IGF-I and IGF-II to IGF-IR are no more than 2 nM and the ratio of the IC\n50 \nvalues for binding of IGF-I/IGF-II to IGF-IR is about 1:3 to 3:1. IC\n50 \nvalues are measured as average or median values of at least three independent measurements. Single IC\n50 \nvalues may be out of the scope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “inhibiting the binding of IGF-I and IGF-II to IGF-IR” as used herein refers, e.g., to inhibiting the binding of I\n125\n-labeled IGF-I or IGF-II to IGF-IR presented on the surface of HT29 (ATCC HTB-38) tumor cells in an in vitro assay. Inhibiting means an IC\n50 \nvalue of 2 nM or lower.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic formulations of the antibodies used in accordance with the present invention are prepared for storage by mixing an antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “surfactant” as used herein denotes a pharmaceutically acceptable surface-active agent. In the formulation of the invention, the amount of surfactant is described as a percentage expressed in weight/volume. The most commonly used weight/volume unit is mg/mL.

Isotonicity agents are used to provide an isotonic formulation. An isotonic formulation is liquid or liquid reconstituted from a solid form, e.g. a lyophilized form and denotes a solution having the same tonicity as some other solution with which it is compared, such as physiologic salt solution and the blood serum. Suitable isotonicity agents comprise but are not limited to salts, including but not limited to sodium chloride(NaCl) or potassium chloride, sugars including but not limited to glucose, sucrose, trehalose or and any component from the group of amino acids, sugars, salts and combinations thereof.

After completion of the diafiltration operation, the excipients (e.g. trehalose) were added as stock solutions to the antibody solution. The surfactant was then added as a 50 to 200-fold stock solution. Finally the protein concentration was adjusted with a buffer to the final huMAb-IGF-1R concentration of approximately 40 mg/mL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll formulations were sterile-filtered through 0.22 μm low protein binding filters and aseptically filled into sterile 6 mL glass vials closed with ETFE (Copolymer of ethylene and tetrafluoroethylene)-coated rubber stoppers and alucrimp caps. The fill volume was approximately 2.4 mL. These formulations were stored at different climate conditions (5° C., 25° C. and 40° C.) for different intervals of time and stressed by shaking (1 week at a shaking frequency of 200 min\n−1 \nat 5° C. and 25° C.) and freeze-thaw stress methods. The samples were analyzed before and after applying the stress tests by the analytical methods 1) UV spectrophotometry, 2) Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC), 3) by Ion exchange chromatography (IEC), 4) by turbidity of the solution and 5) for visible particles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUV spectroscopy, used for determination of protein content, was performed on a Perkin Elmer λ35 UV spectrophotometer in a wavelength range from 240 nm to 400 nm.

Description\n\n\n\n\n NANOSTRUCTURED MICROELECTRODES AND BIOSENSING DEVICES\n\n\nINCORPORATING THE SAME\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATION\n\n\nThis application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/093,667, filed on September 5, 2008, entitled Nanostructured Microelectrodes and Biosensing Devices Incorporating the Same, which is incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nGenomic analysis is revolutionizing early disease diagnosis and dramatically enhancing patient care (McGuire et al. Science 317 :1687, Srinivas et al., Lancet Oncol. 2 :698). Microarrays (Drmanac et al., Science 260: 1649, Hacia et al., Nat. Genet. 14:441) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques (Saiki et al., Science 230:1350) have, as tools, helped to spearhead this revolution, enabling the discovery and the initial development of assays for patient testing (Morris et al., Curr. Opin. Oncol. 19:547). However, spreading the reach of the genomics revolution to the patient bedside demands cost effective tools for individual biomarker profiling assessed relative to a posited disease state. Specifically, tools enabling routine patient care preferably would be simpler, more portable, and less expensive than PCR-based methods, yet should retain a high degree of selectivity and sensitivity.\n\n\nBiomarker analysis based on electronic readout has long been cited as a promising approach that would enable a new family of chip-based devices with appropriate cost and sensitivity for medical testing (Drummond et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 21 :1192, Katz et al.,\n\n\nElectroanalysis 15: 913). The sensitivity of electronic readout is in principle sufficient to allow direct detection of small numbers of analyte molecules with simple instrumentation.\n\n\nHowever, despite tremendous advances in this area as well as related fields working towards new diagnostics (Clack et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 26:825, Geiss et al., Nat.\n\n\nBiotechnol. 26 :317, Hahm et al., Nano Lett. 4 :51, Munge et al., Anal. Chem. 77 :4662,\n\n\nΝicewarner-Pena et al., Science 294 : 137, Park et al., Science 295 :1503, Sinensky et al.,\n\n\nNat. Nano. 2 :653, Steemers et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 18:91, Xiao et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc.\n\n\n129:11896, Zhang et al., Nat. Nano. 1:214, Zhang et al., Anal. Chem. 76 :4093, Yi et al., Biosens. Bioelectron. 20: 1320, Ke et al., Science 319: 180, Armani et al., Science 317:783), \n\n current multiplexed chips have yet to achieve direct electronic detection of biomarkers in cellular and clinical samples. The challenges that have limited the implementation of such devices primarily stem from the difficulty of obtaining very low detection limits in the presence of high background noise levels present when complex biological samples are assayed, and the challenge of generating multiplexed systems that are highly sensitive and specific.\n\n\nThe miniaturization of electrochemical systems continues to be a major focus in analytical and bioanalytical chemistry (Matysik, Miniaturization of Electroanalytical Systems (Springer- Verlag, 2002)), as the attainment of enhanced sensitivity may be enabled with systems possessing micro-to nano- scale dimensions (Szamocki et al., A. Anal. Chem. 2007, 79, 533-539). A great deal of work has been carried out with electrodes with dimensions on the micrometer or sub-micrometer scale. These systems offer many advantages over conventional macroelectrodes such as faster double-layer charging, reduced ohmic loss, high mass-transport rates, and high current density (Bond et al. Anal. Chimi. Acta 1989m 216, 177-230, Heinze, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2003, 32, 1268-1288). Indeed, such electrodes have become well-established tools in a wide range of analytical applications (Bard, Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications (Wiley, New York, 2001), Reimers, Chem. Rev. 2007, 107, 590-600, Zosic, Handbook of electrochemistry (Elsevier, 2007)). Working with nanoscale electrodes, however, is significantly more challenging, as fabrication is typically labour-intensive, insufficiently reproducible, and the currents obtained from such structures are typically difficult to measure accurately.\n\n\nThe use of nanowire electrodes for ultrasensitive nucleic acids and protein detection has been investigated (Gasparac et al. J Am Chem Soc 126:12270). The use of this electrode platform enables the electrochemical detection of picomolar levels of analytes, a level of sensitivity that is not possible using macroscale materials. Although it has been reported that nanowires are able to detect attomolar levels of analytes, this actually corresponds to picomolar levels when dealing with the volumes typically used for analysis. It has also been demonstrated that nanoparticle-modified electrodes may exhibit several advantages over conventional macroelectrodes such as enhancement of mass transport, catalysis, high effective surface area and control over electrode microenvironment (Katz et al. \n\n Electroanalysis 2004, 16, 19-44, Welch et al. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2006, 384, 601-619). Manufacturing arrays of nanowire electrodes, however, is non-trivial.\n\n\nBoron doped diamond microelectrodes modified by electrodeposition of platinum nanoparticles have been used for the oxidative determination of As(III) at levels below 1 ppb (Hrapovic et al. Anal. Chem. 2007, 79, 500-507). However, this type of electrode cannot be incorporated into an array-based format for multiplexed experiments.\n\n\nThe analysis of panels of nucleic acid or protein biomarkers offers valuable diagnostic and prognostic information for clinical decision making. Existing methods that offer the specificity and sensitivity to profile clinical samples are typically costly, slow and serial. There is thus a need for an ultrasensitive device for detecting biomarkers in a multiplexed fashion.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention features nanostructured microelectrodes (NMEs). NMEs are electrodes, which are nanotextured and thus have an increased surface area. Preferred NMEs are comprised of a noble metal, (e.g. gold, platinum, palladium, silver, osmium, indium, rhodium, ruthenium); alloys of noble metals (e.g. gold-palladium, silver- platinum, etc.); conducting polymers (e.g. polypyrole (PPY)); non-noble metals (e.g. copper, nickel, aluminum, tin, titanium, indium, tungsten, platinum); metal oxides (e.g. zinc oxide, tin oxide, nickel oxide, indium tin oxide, titanium oxide, nitrogen-doped titanium oxide (TiOxNy); metal suicides (nickel suicide, platinum suicide); metal nitrides (titanium nitride (TiN), tungsten nitride (WN) or tantalum nitride (TaN)), carbon (nanotubes, fibers, graphene and amorphous) or combinations of any of the above. NMEs of the above- described materials are highly conductive and form strong bonds with probes (e.g. nucleic acids and peptides). Preferred NMEs have a height in the range of about 0.5 to about 100 microns (μm), for example in the range of about 5 to about 20 microns (e.g. 10 microns) ; a diameter in the range of about 1 to about 10 microns; and have nanoscale morphology (e.g. are nanostructured on a length scale of about 1 to about 300 nanometers and more preferably in the range of about 10 to about 20 nanometers). NMEs can be any of a variety of shapes, including hemispherical, irregular (e.g. spiky), cyclical (wire-like) or fractal (e.g. dendritic). The surface of an NME may be further coated with a material, which maintains the electrode's high conductivity, but facilitates binding with a probe. For example, \n\n nitrogen containing NMEs (e.g. TiN, WN or TaN) can bind with an amine functional group of the probe. Similarly, silicon/silica chemistry as part of the NME can bind with a silane or siloxane group on the probe.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention features an NME associated with a probe. In one embodiment, the probe is a nucleic acid (e.g. a ribonucleic acid (RNA), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or analog thereof, including, for example, a peptide nucleic acid (PNA), which contains a backbone comprised of N-(2-aminoethyl)-glycine units linked by peptides rather than deoxyribose or ribose, peptide nucleic acids, locked nucleic acids, or phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers. Under appropriate conditions, the probe can hybridize to a complementary nucleic acid to provide an indication of the presence of the nucleic acid in the sample. In another embodiment, the probe is a peptide or protein (e.g. antibody) that is able to bind to or otherwise interact with a biomarker target (e.g. receptor or ligand) to provide an indication of the presence of the ligand or receptor in the sample. The probe may include a functional group (e.g., thiol, dithiol, amine, carboxylic acid) that facilitates binding with an NME. Probes may also contain other features, such as longitudinal spacers, double-stranded and/or single-stranded regions, polyT linkers, double stranded duplexes as rigid linkers and PEG spacers.\n\n\nIn a further aspect, the invention features a plurality of NMEs arrayed on a substrate. Preferred substrates are comprised of a semiconductor material, such as silicon, silica, quartz, germanium, gallium arsenide, silicon carbide and indium compounds (e.g. indium arsenide, indium, antimonide and indium phosphide), selenium sulfide, ceramic, glass, plastic, polycarbonate or other polymer or combinations of any of the above. Substrates may optionally include a passivation layer, which is comprised of a material, which offers high resistance and maintains a small active surface area. Examples of appropriate materials include: silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, nitrogen doped silicon oxide (SiOxNy) or paralyene. In certain embodiments, the plurality of NMEs arrayed on the substrate include probes in conjunction with monolayer spacers, which minimize probe density, thereby maximizing complexation efficiency. Preferred monolayer spacers have an affinity to metal and can be comprised, for example, of a thiol alcohol, such as mercaptohexanol, alkanethiols, cysteine, cystamine, thiol-amines, aromatic thiols (e.g. benzene thiol, dithiol), phosphonic acids or phosphinic acids. \n\n Another aspect features biosensing devices, such as integrated circuits, comprising, for example, a substrate; an electrically conductive lead on the substrate; an insulating or passivation layer covering the lead, the insulating layer having an aperture exposing a portion of the lead; and a nanostructured microelectrode in electrical communication with the exposed portion of the lead, the microelectrode being adapted to generate a charge in response to a biomolecular stimulus (e.g. nucleic acid hybridization or protein-to-protein binding.\n\n\nIn still another aspect, the invention features methods for manufacturing NMEs. The use of electrodeposition to grow nanostructured microelectrodes from an NME seed allows the sizes and morphologies of these structures to be finely controlled, and versatile fabrication of electrodes composed of one or a variety of substances. NMEs may be prepared on a biosensing device, such as a chip-based format, such that a series of NMEs may be made on a single chip to enable multiplexed experiments. This NME system may be particularly useful and versatile, allowing adjusting of several parameters, including: the microscale control of the NME size and shape, the nanoscale control of NME nanotexturing, and selection of the NME material.\n\n\nYet another aspect features methods for manufacturing biosensing devices having nanostructured microelectrodes. For example, the methods can comprise the steps of providing a substrate and an electrically conductive lead on the substrate, the lead being covered by an insulating layer; etching an aperture in the insulating layer to expose a portion of the lead; and electrodepositing an electrically conductive material on the exposed portion of the lead to form a nanostructured microelectrode as described above.\n\n\nIn another aspect, there is provided a biosensing cartridge comprising: a sample chamber for containing a biological sample; a biosensing chamber for containing a biosensing device as described above and carrying out a biosensing process.\n\n\nIn yet another aspect, there is provided a biosensing workstation comprising: a cartridge holder for holding a biosensing cartridge as described above; an instrument tip for accessing the biosensing cartridge; a selection mechanism for selecting a biosensing process to be carried out; a processor adapted to carry out the biosensing process using the biosensing cartridge and to determine results of the biosensing process from electronic \n\n signals generated from the biosensing cartridge; and a display for displaying the results of the biosensing process.\n\n\nA further aspect features methods for carrying out a biosensing process using probe containing nanostructured microelectrodes incorporated into a device as described above; biasing the microelectrode relative to a reference electrode; measuring a reference charge or reference current flow between the microelectrode and the reference electrode; exposing the microelectrode to a biomolecular stimulus (e.g hybridization between a nucleic acid probe with a complementary nucleic acid or binding between a peptide probe and a binding partner present in a biological sample); measuring a charge or current flow generated at the microelectrode in response to the biomolecular stimulus; and determining the amount of biomolecular stimulus present by comparing the measured charge or measured current flow against the reference charge or reference current flow.\n\n\nNMEs are versatile, robust and easy to work with, hi addition, they can be manufactured using existing silicon CMOS foundry fabrication procedures for top-metal fabrication, or simple extrapolations thereof, such as electroless deposition or electrodeposition onto top-metal layers from a CMOS foundry, allowing the manufacture of NMEs to be easily integrated into existing manufacturing facilities. In addition, NMEs are able to consistently attach to probe molecules. Further, NMEs promote ready accessibility of target molecules such that, when a target molecule that is complementary to the NME- attached probe molecule enters into proximity with that probe, hybridization or protein-to- protein binding occurs with high probability. NMEs are further compatible with the performance of electrocatalytic electrochemistry employed in the read-out of the hybridization event.\n\n\nOther features and advantages of the inventions disclosed herein will become apparent from the following detailed description and claims.\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n\n\nFIG. l(A) is a schematic of an NME biosensing device; FIG. l(B) is a schematic cross-sectional view of an aperture for forming an NME; and FIG. l(C) is a schematic view of the formation of an NME in an aperture;\n\n\nFIG. 2 is a schematic of an NME biosensing device; \n\n FIG. 3 is a schematic of an NME with probes, further showing the presence of spacers in the probe monolayer and between the electrode and the probe;\n\n\nFIG. 4 are SEM images of NMEs with increasing degrees of nanostructuring;\n\n\nFIG. 5 illustrates steps involved in the sensing of specific sequences using an NME;\n\n\nFIG. 6 is a cross-sectional view of an integrated circuit having an NME;\n\n\nFIG. 7 is a circuit diagram of a circuit that may be used with an NME;\n\n\nFIG. 8 is an illustration of a biosensing device having an array of NMEs;\n\n\nFIG. 9 is an illustration of a biosensing device having different NMEs;\n\n\nFIG. 10 is a schematic illustration of a biosensing cartridge; and\n\n\nFIG. 11 is a schematic illustration of a biosensing workstation.\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present disclosure describes nanostructured microelectrodes (NMEs), which may be used in a biosensing device, such as a biosensing chip.\n\n\nNMEs\n\n\nFIG. IA shows a schematic diagram of an exemplary device incorporating NMEs.\n\n\nIn the example shown, the device is a chip having an array of eight leads. In this example, the NME is formed on gold leads that taper to a width of 5 microns. The lead is provided on a substrate of Si and SiCh, although other suitable substrate materials may be used. On top of the lead, an insulating layer, such as Siθ2, is deposited to electrically insulate and passivate the lead. An aperture, in this case a 500 nm hole, is created in the insulating layer to expose a portion of the lead.\n\n\nFIG. IB is a side view of the portion of the chip where the aperture is located, showing the layers of the device. Most commonly known photolithography techniques may be suitable for creating an aperture, such as 100 nm to 1 μm diameter apertures. This is typically achievable in existing fabrication facilities with high robustness and reproducibility. Given that only this exposed surface is electrochemically active, \n\n electrodeposition (Menke et al. Nature Mater. 2006, 5, 914-919) may be used to grow an NME within this space.\n\n\nFIG. 1C is a cross-sectional schematic of an example of NME deposition, using Pd for the NME. This process will be described in greater detail below.\n\n\nReference is now made to FIG. 2, which also illustrates the formation of an NME on a chip. As in FIG. IA, small electrodes are provided in situ on a chip, with the position and electrical contacting of the NMEs defined photolithographically. As in Figure 1 , this chip is an 8-fold multiplexed passive chip. On a silicon substrate, a ~350 nm thick gold layer is patterned, using conventional photolithography techniques, to connect eight 5-μm-wide Au leads to large metal pads for connection to off-chip instrumentation. A pinhole-free insulating SiCh layer is deposited and patterned to create -500 nm openings (e.g., by etching) at the end of each of the Au leads, to expose a section of the lead. A metal NME is then plated in this opening using electrodeposition.\n\n\nThe NME may comprise different conductive materials. Some examples of NMEs have been formed as follows, although variations are possible and will be described in greater detail below: Branched fractal Pd NMEs were deposited in an aqueous solution containing 5 mM of H\n2\nPdCk and 0.5 M of HClO using DC potential amperametry at -250 mV for 15 s. Hemispherical Pd NMEs with nanoscale roughness were deposited in an aqueous solution containing 5 mM of H\n2\nPdCk and 0.5 M of HCl using DC potential amperametry at -100 mV for 300 s. Smooth hemispherical Pd NMEs were fabricated in the same solution at 0 mV for 300 s. Au NMEs were fabricated in a gold bath containing 0.01\n\n\nM solution of HAuCk and 0.5 M H2SO4 at -10OmV for 40 seconds. Pt NMEs were fabricated in a platinum bath containing 5 mM solution of H2PtCk and 0.5 M H2SO4 at -100 mV for 500 s. NME size and morphology can be controlled by varying the metal salt concentration, type and concentration of the supporting electrolyte, and electrodeposition potential and duration.\n\n\nFIG. 3 is a schematic of an NME with probes with spacers in the probe monolayer and between the electrode and probe. A chemical solution containing a metal cation can be brought into communication with the surface of the NME and a reference electrode. The reference electrode may be an NME or a conventional electrode on same lead. An electrical bias can be provided between the NME and the reference electrode. The chemical solution \n\n can then be removed and the electrodes washed. A solution containing the probe molecule can then be brought into communication with the surface of the NME. The probe molecule may be modified or functionalized so that it binds to the surface of the NME. For example, the probe molecule may be functionalized with a thiol, amine, or carboxylate group.\n\n\nNMEs with increasing nanostructuring are shown in FIG. 4. Unexpectedly, variation of electrodeposition conditions allowed growth of extremely smooth hemispherical microelectrodes (left); highly branched nanoscale fractal structures (right); or hemispheres with nanoscale roughness (center). The structure on the left was made with HCl as a supporting electrolyte with an applied potential of 0 mV. The center structures were also made with HCl as a supporting electrolyte but with an applied potential of -100 mV. The structure on the right was made with HClO as a supporting electrolyte and an applied potential of -250 mV. The scale bar on the figure corresponds to 5 μm unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\nFIG. 5 illustrates steps involved in the sensing of specific sequences (Lapierre et al., Anal. Chem. 75:6327, Ratilainen et al., Biochemistry 39:7781, Tomlins et al., Science 570:644) In this example, Pd NMEs are first modified with thiol-derivatized probe sequences, and then target sequences are hybridized. The presence of the target is then transduced using an electrocatalytic reporter system. Electrocatalysis provides electronic amplification, or gain, facilitating high-sensitivity readout: hundreds of electrons may result from each biomolecular complexation event. The approach used herein relies on the primary electron acceptor Ru(NH3)6 3+, which is electrostatically attracted to the electrode surfaces at levels that are correlated with the amount of bound nucleic acid. The inclusion of Fe(CN)ό 3- during electrochemical readout serves to regenerate the Ru(III) substrate, as the Fe(III) species is even easier to reduce, but it is electrostatically repelled from the electrode and thus only undergoes chemical reduction by Ru(II). This method is also label- free and does not require the sample to be processed in any way.\n\n\nThe biosensing device may be provided in the form of a chip, such as an integrated circuit (IC) chip. In general, an IC incorporating the NME may have a substrate with an electrically conductive lead that is covered by an insulating layer. The insulating layer has an aperture that exposes a portion of the lead, and the NME is provided at the exposed portion of the lead. The NME is responsive to a biomolecular stimulus. In particular, the NME may be functionalized with probe molecules that undergo a hybridization reaction \n\n with a target biomolecule (e.g., a nucleic acid sequence), resulting in a charge generated at the NME. The IC also has a charge storage (e.g., a capacitor or a battery) in electrical communication with the lead to store this generated charge. In typical usage, the NME may be exposed to a sample for a known time duration or an integration period, and the charge stored over that time would then be indicative of the presence and/or amount of the target biomolecule.\n\n\nThe stored charge may be communicated to a computing device for analysis, or may be displayed (e.g., through a digital display component) for direct reading of the charge stored after the integration period.\n\n\nSuch an IC may be manufactured using common IC manufacturing equipment, allowing this device to be easily manufactured and to be less costly than other forms of biosensing microelectrodes. The materials used may be those already commonly used in IC manufacturing. For example, the substrate may be made from silicon, quartz, glass, ceramics, silica, sapphire, gallium arsenide, or other materials currently used for ICs. The substrates or supports can incorporate conductive material to serve as an electrode. Conductive supports with a gold surface may also be used. The supports usually comprise a flat (planar) surface, or at least a structure in which the probes or p to be interrogated are in approximately the same plane. The support can be an electrode, or can be attached to an electrode.\n\n\nThe lead may be made of Au, Al, W, TiN, polysilicon or other commonly used lead materials. The IC may include a transistor, such as a field-effect transistor (FET) including n-type silicon channel FETs and p-type silicon channel FETs, or a bipolar transistor including n-p-n bipolar junction transistors and p-n-p bipolar junction transistors.\n\n\nThe IC may be provided with, immersed in or otherwise exposed to an electrocatalytic solution in chemical and electrical communication with the NME. This may assist in charge generation in the NME.\n\n\nReference is now made to FIG. 6. This figure shows a cross-section of an integrated circuit suited to sensing the presence of biomolecules in a biological sample. The substrate\n\n\n(1) is a conventional semiconductor device substrate such as silicon. The channel of a transistor (2), a gate oxide (3), and a polysilicon gate electrode (4) are shown to illustrate the use of conventional CMOS electronics to form the integrated circuit's transistors. A \n\n metal (5) is used to contact the gate electrode. A passivation oxide (6) separates the silicon transistor levels below from the top surface of the chip above. A series of metal vials (7) and interconnects provide selective paths for electrical communication between the transistor layer and the top electrode(s). A substantially planar top surface is a heterogeneous combination of top electrodes (9) and top insulating material (8). The figure illustrates an NME (10) provided on the electrode, for example using the methods described above. The figure illustrates probe biomolecules (11) such as thiol-terminated nucleic acids that are displayed for efficient hybridization with complementary target molecules. An electrocatalytic solution (12) may be employed to provide catalytic read-out of hybridization with the biomolecules (11). Electrical potentials are conveyed, and currents flowed, in a continuous fashion from the NME (10) through the electrical contacts (9) (7) (5) (4) down to the electronic circuitry that resides beneath.\n\n\nReference is now made to FIG. 7, showing a circuit diagram of an example circuit that may be used with the disclosed NME. In this example, the circuit may provide the following functions: biasing of the probe-functionalized NME; integration of the current flowing through the NME into a charge store having a known charge-storage capacity; read-out of the voltage on the charge-store; and selection of the charge-store or NME of interest when a two-dimensional array of stores and electrodes is provided in the context of a highly multiplexed array chip.\n\n\nThe components of the example circuit are now described. A bias voltage is provided at Vbias; a typical choice of bias may be in the range of about 0.1 - 2.8 V. A bias voltage VbiasD is provided at the source-follower drain; a typical choice may be in the range of about 0.1 - 2.8 V. A bias voltage VbmsRis provided at the reset node; a typical choice may be an adjustable value between about -2 V and 2.8 V. The signal voltages are Vsrc which may typically be in the range of about 1.5 - 2.5 V. The column voltage Vcoi may be in the range of about 1.5 V - 0.5 V. Timing control signals include that for row select (e.g., range may be about 0-2.8 V) and for reset (e.g., range may be about 0-4 V). The transistors may be the reset transistor Tr(Reset), the read-out buffer transistor TR(source-follower), and the row-select transistor TR(row-select).\n\n\nThe above biases, signal voltages and timing control signals are examples only and other values may be used. These biases, voltages and signals may be selected or adjusted to suit certain applications or manufacturing conditions, as is commonly known in the art. In \n\n this example, the probe-functionalized NME may include a NME functionalized using a thiolated nucleic acid probe, for example a probe as described above. Vsrc is applied to the probe-functionalized electrode and VbiasR is applied to a second electrode, which may be a NME or any other common electrode, in electrical communication with the electrocatalytic solution. This results in voltage difference between the probe-functionalized electrode and the electrocatalytic solution. A current may thus flow as a consequence of this potential difference. The amount of current flowing may be typically dependent on the amount of hybridization on the probe-functionalized NME, that is the current may be indicative of the amount of target thus detected by the NME.\n\n\nThe operation of the example circuit is now described. In order to capture the current flowing, Lense, the reset transistor is turned on by setting the node 'reset' high enough (e.g., up to 4V, which may be through an on-chip charge-pump or regulator circuit as commonly known in the art) so that node 11 will be charged to a voltage equal to VWs (node 6) which may be typically set to the supply rail: e.g., 2.8V. This is the reset phase. Once this 'reset' operation is completed, Node 5 may be set to OV to turn off the reset transistor Tr(Reset) (1). In doing so, charge injection and parasitic capacitive feedthrough effects will cause node 11, now becoming a floating node, to drop by approximately 300 mV. Therefore after the 'reset' operation the actual 'reset' voltage value at node 11 is approximately 2.5V. At this time, the current Lense flowing is dependent on the voltage applied (i.e., Vsrc-VbiasR). With VbmsR being able to be set arbitrarily to any voltage level from -2V to 2.8V, the applied potential difference may be adjusted. The current Isense discharges the parasitic capacitance at the Vsrc node (11) and its voltage level drops at a rate dependent on the value of the parasitic capacitance at Vsrc (node 11) as well as the flowing Isense during the integration time. After a specific integration time, the resulting integrated voltage at node 11 will be read out through transistors TR(source-follower) and TR(row- select), the source follower buffer transistor and the row-select transistor, by setting the node SEL (8) to a high level (2.8V).\n\n\nThe charge store that is discharged at node 11 may comprise parasitic capacitance of one or more of the transistors that are in electrical communication with the electrode of the pixel region at Vsrc (node 11). The electrode at Vsrc (node 11) may be in electrical communication with the gate of a transistor, such as Tr(source-follower) 2, which provides a parasitic capacitance. In one example embodiment, the charge store may be provided at \n\n least in part by a parasitic capacitance between the gate and drain of the source follower transistor, Tr(source-follower) 2, and a parasitic capacitance between the source and substrate of the reset transistor, Tr(Reset) 1. These are parasitic capacitances between the structures on the semiconductor substrate (e.g., the poly, n-well and substrate) on which or in which the pixel circuit is formed. In an example embodiment, these parasitic capacitances may be in the range of about 1-2 femtoFarads or more generally in the range of about 0.5 to 3 femtoFarads or any range subsumed therein. The contacts to the probe- functionalized NME may be formed in different layers above the regions of the semiconductor substrate used to form the transistors. In an alternate embodiment, the polarity of the bias may be reversed and the parasitic capacitance at Vsrc may be charged instead of discharged during the integration period.\n\n\nReference is now made to FIG. 8, which shows a top view of an example IC that has a multiplexed array of individually-addressable probe-functionalized NMEs. By individually addressable, it is meant that each NME may be individually electrically accessed, such that the current or charge generated by each NME may be individually measured. In this example, the NMEs are arrayed in a row-column fashion. There are n rows and m columns for a total of m x n independent NMEs. If there were only a single row or column of NME, then it may not be necessary to have row/column address circuitry. However, when large total numbers of NMEs are desired on a single device, it may be more efficient to array them in a two-dimensional grid or similar, and thus independent electrical access to each NME may be useful. This may be efficiently achieved using the circuitry illustrated in FIG. 7. In this approach, the charge associated with the current flowing through each NME is integrated into a charge storage, such as a capacitor; and a voltage proportional to the stored charge may be read out for the NME in a particular row by setting the node SEL (8) to a high level and monitoring the voltage on that column Vcoi.\n\n\nThe figure illustrates that, for each column, there may exist a time-dependent signal (whose time-dependence may be determined by the clocking of the row-address circuitry) which, in some embodiments, may be fed, in cases with the aid of electronic buffering or amplification, into an analog-to-digital converter. The analog-to-digital converter may accept signals having a pre-determined voltage swing (such as 0-1 V, typically) and, for each input channel, may carry out a quantization operation in which a digital representation of the analog level in that signal is estimated. The output of the A/D converter is a digital \n\n stream which combines parallelism (e.g., multiple parallel wires, each corresponding to a significant figure in the binary representation of the values) and serial timing (e.g., a timed representation of sequential data elements corresponding, for example, to different probe- functionalized NMEs).\n\n\nReference is now made to FIG. 9, showing three adjacent NMEs along a single row, in a configuration that may be provided on a biosensing device or IC as described above. These three NMEs are read using three different columns j, j+1, and j+2. This figure illustrates a number of features with respect to the differences among NMEs.\n\n\nNMEs Ey and Ey+i may be functionalized both with the same class of probes (e.g. thiolfunctionalized PNA), but the sequences may be different. That is, each NME may be functionalized with similar probes that have different target biomolecules. In this example, electrodes Eij and Ey+i are response to different sequences present in the sample under study. In sum, the use of different functionalizations enables sensing of biomolecules within a single class, but having a different sequence, conformation, or functionality.\n\n\nNMEs Ey, Ey+i, and Ey+2 are shown having different morphologies and/or sizes, and different degrees of nanostructuring. As discussed above, different morphologies and/or sizes may provide both different limits of detection, and different dynamic ranges, in detecting of target molecules. By incorporating NMEs having different morphologies and/or degrees of nanostructuring onto one device, it may be possible to expand the dynamic range of target concentrations that may be sensed using a single device. In sum, the use of different NME morphologies, sizes and/or nanostructurings may enable sensing of a wider range of concentrations of a given target species than would otherwise be achieved if only one morphology/nanostructuring were provided on a biosensing device.\n\n\nNMEs Ey+i and Ey+2 are also depicted as being functionalized using different classes of probe molecules. For example, Ey+i may be functionalized using a nucleic acid such as PNA, and Ey+2 may be functionalized using antibodies which attach to the electrode. In sum, the use of different classes of probe molecules may enable sensing of different classes of target biomolecules, for example ranging from DNA to RNA to micro- RNA to proteins, using a single biosensing device. \n\n Biosensing cartridge and workstation\n\n\nThe biosensing device as described above may be incorporated into a biosensing cartridge. Such a cartridge may contain chambers for sample processing such as disruption and resin or bead-based nucleic acid purification, as well as a chamber for the biosensing device. The cartridge may be self-contained, for example all necessary reagents may be contained in the lid of the cartridge. The cartridge may be reusable, or may be disposable. A disposable cartridge may minimize the risk of cross-contamination between samples.\n\n\nThe cartridge may be used in a biosensing workstation for coordinating and carrying out the biosensing process. Components of the workstation may include sample holders, instrument tips such as pipettors for manipulation of the sample, a sample identification module, a selection mechanism for selecting a test to be carried out, an electronic display for indicating the results of a biosensing test and a processor for managing these components and carrying out the selected tests. The workstation may hold a number of different cartridges at one time (e.g., ten or more). The workstation may allow random access to the cartridges - that is, independent tests may be run at any time on any cartridge in the workstation. The workstation may have disposable instrument tips, which would be the only part of the workstation that comes into direct contact with the sample and reagents. Disposable tips, together with disposable cartridges, may minimize the risk of cross- contamination between samples tested in the workstation.\n\n\nIn general, a biosensing cartridge may have a first chamber for containing the sample to be tested, and a second chamber containing the biosensing device as described above. There may be addition chambers to perform other actions on the sample, such as purification, and/or subdivision (e.g., through chemical, mechanical or vibrational means). Some processing and disruption of the sample may be carried out in the first chamber itself. The sample may be introduced from the first to the second chamber for detection by the biosensing device in the second chamber. There may be pre-set time interval from activation of the device or start of the test to the introduction of the sample into the second chamber. This time interval may allow the biosensing device to be suitably biased or otherwise readied for the test. The charge or current flow generated in the biosensing device may be measured after an integration period, as described above. \n\n Reference is now made to FIG. 10, showing an example of a biosensing cartridge and the steps of using such a cartridge. In this example, the cartridge has three chambers, a sample chamber containing the sample, a purifying chamber for purifying the sample, and a biosensing for performing the biosensing. As shown in this example, the lid of the cartridge is provided with capsules containing reagents for each chamber, and through which an instrument tip may be inserted. This allows the cartridge to be self-contained, already containing the reagents suitable to carry out the biosensing operation and tailored to the particular probes and/or target biomolecules of the biosensing device being used. In this example, the sample chamber has one capsule, for accessing the sample. The purifying chamber has three capsules - two containing a washing reagent, and one containing an elution buffer. The biosensing chamber has three capsules - each containing an electrochemical mix containing analytes for the biosensing device. The instrument tip may be inserted sequentially in each capsule, in order to carry out the biosensing operation. For example, the capsule on the sample chamber may contain a lysis buffer containing chemical denaturants (e.g., urea or formamide); the capsules one the purifying chamber may have two capsules containing a wash buffer and the elution buffer may be a standard buffer, such as one containing low levels of sodium, chloride and tris salt; the capsules on the biosensing chamber may contain redox reporter groups such as ruthenium hexamine, ferricyanide and a buffer containing sodium, phosphate, chloride and magnesium.\n\n\nIn use, the sample is first extracted from the sample chamber through its single capsule. The sample is then introduced into the purifying chamber, where it is washed twice as the instrument tip is introduced through the two washing capsules and the elution buffer is introduced. Through this process, the sample may be prepared for biosensing by the biosensing device. For example, in the case of a nucleic acid sample, the process in the purifying chamber may isolate the RNA or DNA in the sample. The purified sample is then introduced into the biosensing chamber, through each electrochemical capsule. The biosensing device in the biosensing chamber may then detect any target biomolecules present in the sample, and the generated current or charge may be measured. Where the cartridge is used in a workstation, the processor in the workstation may read this generated current or charge and determine the presence of the target biomolecule based on this reading. \n\n Reference is now made to FIG. 11, showing an example of a biosensing workstation. This work station includes a bar code reader, allowing identification of samples using unique bar codes provided on each cartridge. The workstation has a selection mechanism, in this example a touch screen that allows the selection of a particular test to be carried out. There is also a waste container for disposing any wastes generated by the biosensing process. The processor of the workstation may be connected to an external computing device, such as another workstation, for further analysis. This connection may be through a wireless network. The workstation may be relatively small (e.g., a footprint of 1.5 x 1 ft), allowing convenience and ease of use.\n\n\nMethods of Use\n\n\nMethods for using NMEs and devices comprising the same is now described. A device may be provided with the NME already functionalized with a probe molecule, or the probe molecule may be bound to the NME when preparing the device for use. The device is then biased for use, for example by adding an electrocatalytic reporter and waiting a certain time interval. In addition to the NME, there may be a reference electrode, which may or may not be an NME, in contact with the electrocatalytic reporter but not in contact with the sample. The current flow or voltage bias generated over this time interval between the NME and the reference electrode may be measured and recorded as the reference point. The NME is then exposed to a sample of interest, and the current flow or charge generated over a certain time interval (also referred to as the integration period) may be measured. By comparing the difference in current flow or charge between the exposure time interval and the biasing time interval, the concentration, binding and/or amount of target biomolecule in the sample may be determined.\n\n\nDevices comprising NMEs, as described herein, may be used in conjunction with appropriate probes to detect the presence or absence of particular biomarkers in a sample.\n\n\nA \"sample\" or \"biological sample\" as herein refers to any natural (e.g. plant, animal, algal, bacterial or viral) or synthetic material containing DNA, RNA and/or proteins, including, for example, clinical samples, such as tissues, cell cultures or fluids isolated from an individual\n\n\n(including without limitation blood, plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, lymph, tears, urine, saliva, mucus, synovial fluid, cerebrospinal fluid and tissue sections) environment (e.g., water, food or air samples). Biological samples may be further processed via a variety of means, including lysis (electrical, mechanical and chemical), electrophoresis, enzymatic \n\n digestion. Most often, the sample has been removed from an organism, but the term \"biological sample\" can also refer to cells or tissue analyzed in vivo, i.e., without removal. Typically, a \"biological sample\" will contain cells, but the term can also refer to non-cellular biological material, such as non-cellular fractions of blood, saliva, or urine. \"A biological sample\" further refers to a medium, such as a nutrient broth or gel in which an organism has been propagated, which contains cellular components, such as proteins or nucleic acid molecules.\n\n\nProbes for use with the instant described NMEs may be comprised of nucleic acids. A \"nucleic acid probe\" refers to a nucleic acid (e.g. a ribonucleic acid (RNA), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or an analog thereof, including, for example, a peptide nucleic acid (PNA), which contains a backbone comprised of N-(2-aminoethyl)-glycine units linked by peptides rather than deoxyribose or ribose linked by phosphodiesterase linkages) capable of binding to a target nucleic acid of complementary sequence through one or more types of chemical bonds, usually through complementary base pairing, usually through hydrogen bond formation. As used herein, a nucleic acid probe may include natural (i.e., A, G, C, or T) or modified on bases (7-deazaguanosine, inosine, etc.) or on sugar moiety. In addition, the bases in a probe can be joined by a linkage other than a phosphodiester bond, so long as it does not interfere with hybridization. It will be understood by one of skill in the art that probes may bind target sequences lacking complete complementarity with the probe sequence depending upon the stringency of the hybridization conditions. By assaying for the presence or absence of the probe, one can detect the presence or absence of the select sequence or subsequence. Methods for detecting target nucleic acids using nucleic acid probes are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 7,361,470 entitled \"Electrocatalytic Nucleic Acid Hybridization Detection.\" and US 2005/0084881 of the same name.\n\n\n\"Hybridization\" refers to any process by which a strand of nucleic acid binds with a complementary strand through base pairing. \"Hybridization conditions\" refer to standard conditions under which nucleic acid molecules are used to identify similar nucleic acid molecules. Such standard conditions are disclosed, for example, in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Labs Press, 1989. Sambrook et al., ibid., is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety (see specifically, pages 9.31- 9.62). In addition, formulae to calculate the appropriate hybridization and wash conditions to \n\n achieve hybridization permitting varying degrees of mismatch of nucleotides are disclosed, for example, in Meinkoth et al., 1984, Anal. Biochem . 138, 267-284; Meinkoth et al., ibid., is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Non-limiting examples of hybridization conditions include low stringency hybridization conditions, moderate stringency hybridization conditions and high stringency hybridization conditions.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the probe is a peptide (comprised of, for example, 4-40 amino acids) or proteins (e.g. antibody) that is able to bind to or otherwise interact with a biomarker target (e.g. receptor or ligand) to provide an indication of the presence of the ligand or receptor in the sample. Methods for detecting analytes using peptide or protein probes are described, for example in International patent application WO 2007/094805 (PCT/US2006/013771) entitled \"Method for Electrocatalytic Protein Detection.\"\n\n\nProbes may include a functional group (e.g., thiol, dithiol, amine, carboxylic acid) that facilitates binding with an NME. Probes may also contain other features, such as longitudinal spacers, double-stranded and/or single-stranded regions, polyT linkers, double stranded duplexes as rigid linkers and PEG spacers.\n\n\nAs described above, the surface nanostructure of the NME may be controlled, and may influence the sensitivity and/or efficiency of a device having the NME. In Example 1 , the influence of surface nanostructure on the detection efficiency for nucleic acids was investigated. Two different types of NMEs were compared - a more finely nanostructured NME obtained with a low deposition potential was compared to a more coarsely textured one obtained with a higher deposition potential.\n\n\nWhile concentrations as low as 1 pM could be detected with the more finely nanostructured NME obtained with a low deposition potential, the detection limit was increased to 10 pM for the more coarsely textured one obtained with a higher deposition potential.. These results demonstrate that increased nanostructuring contribute to more sensitive biosensing capabilities in an electrode platform. This analysis revealed that the more finely structured NMEs showed greater responsiveness to sub-nM concentrations of target sequences.\n\n\nThe 10 aM sensitivity observed here with the disclosed NMEs and electrocataytic reporter system provides a low detection limit for a label- and PCR-free sensor; the detection limit corresponds to the detection of < 100 copies of the target sequence. While \n\n the measurement of 60-1000 copies of target sequence has been achieved previously with electrochemical detectors exploiting multi-step catalytic readout (Munge et al., Anal. Chem. 77 :4662, Nicewarner-Pena et al., Science 294:137, Park et al., Science 295 :1503, Sinensky et al., Nat. Nano. 2 :653, Steemers et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 18:91, Xiao et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 129: 11896, Zhang et al., Nat. Nano. 1 :214, Zhang et al., Anal. Chem. 76:4093), the disclosed device provides this measurement on a chip-based platform with single-step readout.\n\n\nExample 2 describes use of a multiplexed electrode platform, as described herein, to directly read a panel of cancer biomarkers in clinically-relevant samples using electronic signals. The system combines nanotextured electrodes with rapid catalytic readout to achieve a long-standing goal: the multiplexed analysis of cancer biomarkers using an inexpensive and practical platform.\n\n\nExample 3 describes the use of an NME based chip to detect microRNA, one of the most challenging detection targets. Electronic readout of microRNA profiles offers a rapid, yet highly accurate, method to directly assay RNA samples for specific sequences without the need for target amplification.\n\n\nAlthough the provided examples are directed to the detection of cancer biomarkers, other applications may be possible for the NME device, which may involve detecting DNA, RNA and/or proteins. Examples include profiling of breast cancer genes (e.g., by detecting RNA markers); profiling of leukemia-related genes (e.g., by detecting RNA markers); profiling of cytochrome P450 mutations that affect drug metabolism (e.g. Warfarin) (e.g., by detecting DNA and RNA markers); profiling of mutations associated with genetic disease (e.g. Cystic fibrosis) (e.g., by detecting DNA markers); detection and typing of viruses (e.g. HPV and HIV) (e.g., by detecting DNA and RNA markers); detection of cancer-related proteins using an electrochemical immunoassay format (e.g. prostate specific antigen (PSA)) (e.g., by detecting protein markers); and detection of micro RNAs to identify cancer. Biosensing devices incorporating these NMEs may be adapted to detect for these other biomolecules by binding suitable probes to the NME and/or by selecting a suitable electrocatalytic reaction to be sensed, as commonly known in the art.\n\n\nIt would be understood by a person skilled in the art that variations are possible without departing from the present disclosure. All examples and embodiments described are \n\n provided for the purpose of illustration only, and are not intended to be limiting. All references mentioned herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nExample 1. Parameters for Manufacturing NMEs\n\n\nIn this example, Pd was used as an electrode material. To investigate the time- dependence of the electrodeposition, the structures of the Pd NMEs being electrodeposited were monitored as a function of time. Time-dependent electrodeposition experiments were performed at -100 mV using 0.5 M HCl as supporting electrolyte. Pd structures were formed for (a) 25, (b) 50, (c) 125, (d) 250, and (e) 500 s. After 50 s, structures with average diameters of 1.3 μm and heights of 0.5 μm were observed, and after 500 s the Pd electrodes were typically 8 μm and 5 μm in diameter and height. The smaller structures made with shorter deposition times typically exhibited depressions in the center of the microelectrodes, which may indicate that nucleation occurs preferentially at the boundary of the aperture.\n\n\nAnother controllable parameter that may influence the final structure of the NME is the deposition potential. Specifically, the size and surface morphology of the NMEs may be controlled in this way. Dendritic fractals are phenomena generally observed in non- equilibrium growth such as the growth of snowflakes, the aggregation of soot particles, and the solidification of metals. Such fractal structures are also obtained by nonequilibrium electrodeposition of metals and used as model systems for the study of branching and fractal growth processes (Fleury, Nature 1997, 390, 145-148). It is generally believed that the morphology of crystals heavily depends on the \"distance\" of their formation conditions from the thermodynamic equilibrium: near-equilibrium conditions lead to polyhedral crystals surrounded with thermodynamically stable crystal faces, but increase of this \"distance\" makes the growing fronts of crystals with flat surfaces instable to form dendrites (Fukami et al. J. Phys. Chem. C 2007, 111, 1150-1160). In the case of electrodeposition of metals, such \"distance\" may be tuned continuously and reversibly by simply changing the deposition potential and more negative potential can exert higher driving force and thus increase the \"distance\" from the equilibrium for electrocrystallization. Thus, electrodeposition may be controlled spatially and kinetically to produce arrayed NMEs with varied well-defined morphologies.\n\n\nPd structures were formed at (a) 0 mV, (b) -100 mV, (c) -250 mV, and (d) -400 mV for 250s with the use of 0.5 M HCl as supporting electrolyte. More negative deposition \n\n potentials were found to typically lead to larger, but less compact, microstructures. At a deposition potential of 0 mV, a cake-shaped structure of 3.5 μm diameter and 0.7 μm height was obtained. When the applied potential was changed to -100 mV, a rougher microstructure was obtained that was also larger in size (average diameter = 5 μm and height = 2.5 μm). The nanotexturing obtained is an irregular aggregate of very small nanoparticles. When a more negative potential of -250 mV was applied, a dendritic fractal microstructure was obtained and its diameter and height were found to further increase 11 and 6 μm, respectively. If the potential was increased further (e.g. to -400 mV), the microelectrode structure became more open and the structure is no longer continuous.\n\n\nThe electrochemical behaviour of the Pd NMEs formed as a function of potential was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The electrochemical response of the NMEs was monitored in a solution containing 3 mM Ru(NH\n3\n)6 3+ and 0.09 M sodium phosphate, at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. As expected, steady-state voltammograms are observed for each electrode, consistent with the microscale dimensions of the electrodes. For the electrodes made using deposition potentials of 0, -100, or -250 mV, the currents observed are well- correlated with the size of the electrode. That is, the greater the diameter of the NME (i.e., formed at a larger applied potential), the greater the response current observed. However, for structures made at -400 mV, currents observed were lower than expected based on the size of the microelectrode, indicating that the discontinuity of the electrode structure may lead to poor electrical connectivity and loss of working area.\n\n\nThus, moderate deposition potentials appear to provide the most pronounced nanotexturing while maintaining the integrity of the resultant NME, as small nanoparticles are formed on the surface of the microelectrodes. It appears that providing too large of a driving potential for the deposition reaction accelerates the kinetics to a point where metal nanoparticles are formed without strong connectivity to the core of the NME.\n\n\nNME morphology may also be controlled via electrolyte effects. Pd NMEs were formed at -100 mV for 250s using (a) 0.5M H2SO4 and (b) 0.5M HC1O4 as the supporting electrolyte. These structures were formed under the same conditions as described above, where HCl was used as a supporting electrolyte. The structures formed in H2SO4 and HCIO4 were significantly larger than those formed in HCl, and interestingly, all three displayed different types of nanostructuring. NMEs made in HC1O4 showed the finest nanostructuring, with features as small as 10-20 run present. In HCl, the electrode was more \n\n compact, and the nanostructuring was on the order of 100 nm. The coarsest nanostructuring was obtained in H\n2\nSCh, where the particles comprising the electrode were larger than 200 nm. These observations indicate that the NME morphology may also be controlled by varying the supporting electrolyte used for electrodeposition.\n\n\nTypically, the dendritic structures for the NME depend on the conditions during manufacture, including concentrations of the electrodeposition solution, choice of the metal to be electrodeposited, and the applied potential during electrodeposition. These parameters are readily controllable. For example, it may be desirable to control the concentration and purity of the reagents used in electrodeposition to within 5%. The choice of metal is simple to control as long as purity of the reagents is high, simply by obtaining the correct material. The potential during electrodeposition may be readily controlled to within a few mV, which is sufficient for controlling the size and morphology of the resultant NME.\n\n\nExample 2. Direct Profiling of Prostate Cancer Biomarkers in Tumor Tissue Using a Multiplexed Nanostructured Microelectrode Integrated Circuit\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nChip fabrication. The chips were fabricated at the Canadian Photonics Fabrication Center. 3\" silicon wafers were passivated using a thick layer of thermally grown silicon dioxide. A 350 nm gold layer was deposited on the chip using electron-beam assisted gold evaporation. The gold film was patterned using standard photolithography and a lift-off process. A 500 nm layer of insulating silicon dioxide was deposited using chemical vapor deposition. 500 nm apertures were imprinted on the electrodes using standard photolithography, and 2 mm x 2 mm bond pads were exposed using standard photolithography.\n\n\nFabrication of nanostructured microelectrodes. Chips were cleaned by rinsing in acetone, IPA, and DI water for 30 s and dried with a flow of nitrogen. All electrodeposition was performed at room temperature with a Bioanalytical Systems Epsilon potentiostat with a three-electrode system featuring an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum wire auxiliary electrode. 500 nm apertures on the fabricated electrodes were used as the working electrode and were contacted using the exposed bond pads. Platinum NMEs were fabricated in a platinum bath containing 5 mM solution of H2PtC16 and 0.5 M HC1O4 at -250 mV for\n\n\n10 s using DC potential amperometry. \n\n Preparation and purification of oligonucleotides. All synthetic oligonucleotides were stringently purified by reversed-phase HPLC. The following probe and target sequences were used in experiments. Seq. Pl. Type III fusion probe (PNA): NH2-Cys-Gly- ATA AGG CTT CCT GCC GCG CT-CONH2 (SEQ ID NO. 1), Seq. P2. Type I fusion probe (PNA): NH2-Cys-Gly-CTG GAA TAA CCT GCC GCG CT-CONH2 (SEQ ID NO. 2), Seq. P3. Type VI fusion probe (PNA): NH2-Cys-Gly-ATA AGG CTT CTG AGT TCA AA-C0NH2 (SEQ ID NO. 3), Seq. Tl (Type III TMPRSS2:ERG fusion DNA target): 5'AGC GCG GCA GGA AGC CTT AT3' (SEQ ID NO. 4), Seq. T2 (WT TMPRSS2 DNA target): 5'AGC GCG GCA GGT CAT 10 ATT GA3' (SEQ ID NO. 5), Seq. T3 (WT ERG DNA target): 5'TCA TAT CAA GGA AGC CTT AT3' (SEQ ID NO. 6), Seq. T4 (noncomplementary DNA target): 5'TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TT3' (SEQ ID NO. 7). Oligonucleotides were quantitated by measuring absorbance at 260 nm and ext. coefficients calculated using: http://www.idtdna.com/analyzer/Applications/OligoAnalyzer/.\n\n\nModification of NMEs with PNA probes. A solution containing 500 nM thiolated single stranded PNA, 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), and 25 mM sodium chloride was heated at 50oC for 10 minutes. A suitable amount of 10 mM MCH was then added to make the final MCH concentration of 100 nM. 0.5-10 μL (depending on the degree of multiplexing) of this mixture was deposited on the NMEs in a dark humidity chamber overnight at 4°C. The NMEs were rinsed in 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), and 25 mM NaCl buffer before measurement.\n\n\nElectrochemical measurements. Electrochemical signals were measured in solutions containing 10 μM Ru(NH3)6 3+, 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), 25 mM sodium chloride, and 4 mM Fe(CN)6 3-. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) signals before and after hybridization were measured using a potential step of 5 mV, pulse amplitude of 50 mV, pulse width of 50 ms, and a pulse period of 100 ms. Cyclic voltammetry signals before and after hybridization were collected with a scan rate of 100 mV/s. Limiting reductive current (I) was quantified by subtracting the background at 0 mV from the cathodic current at -300 mV in a cyclic voltammetry signal. Signal changes corresponding to hybridization were calculated as follows: ΔI = (Ids-Iss)/Iss x 100% (ss = before hybridization, ds = after hybridization). \n\n Hybridization protocol. Hybridization solutions typically contained target sequences in 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), and 25 mM NaCl. Electrodes were incubated at 37°C in humidity chamber in dark for 60 minutes and were washed extensively with buffer before electrochemical analysis.\n\n\nIsolation of mRNA. The mRNAs were extracted from cell lines and patient tissue samples with the Dynabeads mRNA Direct Kit (Invitrogen). Two typical prostate cancer tissue samples were obtained from radical prostatectomies collected by from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network. The tissue was stored at -85°C until tumor-rich tissue was selected for mRNA extraction. The concentrations of mRNA targets were measured by NanoDrop ND- 1000 of Thermo Fisher Scientific (USA). All of the fusion sequences were confirmed by RT-PCR and direct sequencing.\n\n\nKinetic measurements of DNA hybridization at NMEs. PNA (seq. 2)-modified\n\n\nNMEs were prepared as described above. Rinsed NMEs were immersed in a solution containing 10 μM Ru(NH3)6 3+, 4 mM Fe(CN)6 3-, 100 £M DNA target (seq.4 to 7), 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), and 25 mM NaCl. The electrocatalytic CV signals were obtained as described above. All measurements were performed at 37°C.\n\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\n\nWe sought to generate a nanomaterial-based platform for ultrasensitive bioanalysis that is i) highly robust and straightforward to fabricate; ii) multiplexed and scalable; and iii) sensitive and specific when presented with heterogeneous biological samples. To satisfy requirements i) and ii) we required a means of achieving reproducible placement of each individual sensing element using a scalable protocol. To address requirement iii), we sought to incorporate nanoscale features into our sensing array. The production of arrayed nanostructured sensing elements, however, can be labor-intensive and prone to low reproducibility. Electron-beam lithography provides the needed control over nanoscale features and their placement; however, it is a serial technique not presently suited to low- cost, high-volume chip production. Our approach was instead to use cost-effective conventional photolithography to position and address our electrodes; and then find a means to bring about, with a high degree of reproducibility, the nanostructuring of these microelectrodes. \n\n We constructed an 8-fold multiplexed chip by patterning a 350 nm thick gold layer on a silicon chip to create eight 5-μm-wide Au wires attached to large metal pads that would serve as external contacts. SiO2 was then deposited as a passivating layer and patterned to create apertures with 500 nm diameters at the end of each of the Au wires. These openings were created to serve as individual templates for controlled, local growth of nanostructures. We then used palladium electrodeposition to deposit metal in the patterned apertures. We found that we were able to regulate the size of the nanostructures by varying the deposition time. We were readily able to confine the diameter of the structures to the ultramicroelectrode regime (<10 u). Under conditions enabling rapid metal deposition, the surfaces of the microelectrodes displayed a high level of nanostructuring, with feature sizes of approximately 20 nm. These structures displayed ideal microelectrode behavior, exhibiting low capacitive currents and high steady-state plateau currents .\n\n\nIn order to make these nanostructured microelectrodes (NMEs) functional as nucleic acids biosensors, we modified them with thiolated peptide-nucleic acids (PNA) probes. The use of PNA as a probe molecule has been shown previously to increase the sensitivity of biosensing assays and is particularly advantageous in electrochemical assays because it produces lowered background currents. To transduce nucleic acids hybridization into an electrical signal, we employed an electrocatalytic reporter system previously developed by our laboratory. (Lapierre, M. A. et al., Anal. Chem. 2003, 75. 6327-6333). This reporter system relies on the accumulation of Ru(NH3)63+ at electrode surfaces when polyanionic species like nucleic acids bind, and the catalysis of the reduction of Ru(III) via the inclusion of Fe(CN)63-, which regenerates Ru(III) and allows multiple reductions per metal center. When PNA-modifϊed NMEs were challenged with a complementary sequence, detectable signal changes could be clearly detected through the femtomolar concentration range. Negligible signal changes were observed with completely non-complementary sequences.\n\n\nThe cancer biomarkers selected for analysis on this platform are a group of gene fusions specific to prostate cancer. These fusions, resulting from a chromosomal translocation that joins the ERG and TMPRSS2 genes, were recently discovered and appear in at least 50% of prostate tumours. Furthermore, there are ~ 20 sequence types that feature different fusion sites, and the exact type of fusion present in a tumour appears to correlate with its aggressiveness and metastatic potential. These sequences are therefore not only promising diagnostic markers, but are also factors with prognostic value. \n\n To determine whether the NME sensors could discriminate gene fusion sequences from the wild-type sequences that would be half-complementary, a sensor modified with a probe complementary to the splice site of the Type III fusion was challenged with: (1) the fusion target (seq. Tl), (2) the sequence corresponding to the wild-type TMPRSS2 gene (seq. T2), and (3) a sequence corresponding to the wild-type ERG gene (seq. T3). A completely non-complementary control was also assayed (seq. T4). With a hybridization time of 60 minutes, large signal increases were observed with the fully complementary target, while a much lower signal change was seen with the TMPRSS2 target. The ERG target produced an even lower signal change, and that observed with the non- complementary sequence was negligible. The TMPRS S2 target binds to the portion of the probe located at the end of the sequence not attached to the electrode, while the ERG target binds to the portion of the probe located at the end tethered to the electrode surface. The different signal levels observed indicate that the most accessible side of the probe is better able to bind incoming target molecules, while hybridization with the more buried part of the sequence is inefficient.\n\n\nTo determine whether the hybridization of the different targets required the full 60 minute time period originally tested for accurate readout, the electrocatalytic signals were monitored at a variety of intervals within the window originally tested. Interestingly, the rise of the signals is very fast, with significant current changes observed within 2 minutes. Over the total 60-minute period, however, the signals for the half-complementary and non- complementary sequences fall noticeably; with 20-50% of the 2-minute signal vanishing by 60 minutes. It appears that for sequences that are not fully complementary, some nonspecific binding occurs in the first few minutes of exposure of the NME sensor to the target solution, but these complexes do not remain stable and do not remain immobilized on the electrode. Thus, while non-complementary sequences can be discriminated from complementary sequences with short hybridization times, longer times increase the differential signal changes, and thus the degree of specificity.\n\n\nThe performance of these nanostructured microelectrodes as nucleic acids detectors indicated that the patterned structures were indeed sensitive and specific when used under appropriate hybridization conditions. We therefore sought to prove that multiplexed chip- based NMEs could be used to assay cancer biomarkers presented in heterogeneous biological samples. To explore this capability, cell extracts and tumour samples from \n\n prostate cancer patients were assessed to determine whether the sensitivity and specificity of the system was robust enough for clinical testing.\n\n\nTo determine whether we could detect prostate-cancer associated gene fusions using the NME chip, we first analyzed mRNA isolated from two prostate cancer cell lines: VCaP and DU 145. The former cell line is type III fusion positive, and the latter is fusion negative. No appreciable signal changes occurred when 10 ng of mRNA from the cell line that lacks this sequence were incubated with a NME displaying a probe complementary to the type III fusion (seq. Pl), while large signal increases were observed in the presence of 10 ng mRNA from the cell line that does contain the type III fusion. In addition, the modification of NMEs with a probe complementary to a different fusion (seq. P2) did not yield a significant signal with positive mRNA sample. The detection of the fused gene is therefore highly specific. These results are significant, as efficiency in the use of sample (10 ng) and the total time required for analysis (less than 1.5 hours) significantly improve upon other detection methods like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and sequencing.\n\n\nThe ultimate application of the NME chip is the direct, multiplexed analysis of a panel of cancer biomarkers in relevant patient samples. To test the performance of our device for this type of application, we analyzed a panel of mRNA samples collected from cell lines and clinical tumor samples for a series of gene fusions. We obtained a group of samples that would allow the detection of the three most common types of prostate-cancer gene fusions: type I, type III, and type VI. Different clinical outcomes are associated with these sequences, with type III fusions being the most common but correlating with low cancer recurrence rates, whereas type I and VI fusions are correlated with aggressive cancers with high levels of recurrence. It is therefore of great interest to be able to differentiate these fusions in tumours, and a method that would permit their presence or absence to be assessed quickly and straightforwardly would be of value in their further study and validation as diagnostic biomarkers.\n\n\nProbes complementary to each of the three fusions were deposited on their respective electrodes on NME chips, and 5 different mRNA samples were profiled for the presence of different gene fusions in a multiplexed format. Three cell lines were tested: VCap (type III positive),28 NCI-H660 (type III and VI positive)30, and DU145 (fusion negative).28 In addition, two tumour samples (tissues collected by radical prostatectomies) were tested, one that was positive for the type I fusion, and one that was positive for the \n\n type III fusion, as confirmed by conventional sequencing. In each case, all experiments took less than 2 hours and required only 10 ng of mRNA. By analyzing the electrochemical signals collected at NMEs displaying different probes, we ascertained the identity of fused genes present in each sample. For example, in the patient sample containing the type I fusion (as verified by sequencing), the current values observed at each probe-modified NME decreased in the following order: I »» III > VI. In the patient sample containing the type III fusion, the electronic signals again pointed to the correct identity of the fusion with probe III »» I > VI. These results, and those obtained with DU 145, VCaP, and H660 cellular RNA, where electronic profiling correctly called the absence or presence of gene fusions, indicate that NME chips are able to profile these important biomarkers in complex samples and to distinguish biomarker profiles associated with different clinical outcomes.\n\n\nThe detection platform described here is not only specific, sensitive, and robust, it is also practical and scalable. The reproducible fabrication method we chose is amenable to the production of probe-modified chips using the same photolithographic technologies in widespread use in consumer electronics microchip fabrication; and only simple, inexpensive instrumentation is needed for readout. Microfluidics are not required for automated analysis, as hybridization can be performed and read out in a single reaction vessel. This system represents an attractive alternative to PCR-based methods that are sensitive but difficult to automate in a clinical setting.\n\n\nIn sum, the new multiplexed electrode platform we describe here is the first to read directly a panel of cancer biomarkers in clinically-relevant samples using electronic signals. The array enabling these measurements features microelectrodes that possess controllable and versatile nanotexturing essential for sensitivity. The system combines these nanotextured electrodes with rapid catalytic readout to achieve a long-standing goal: the multiplexed analysis of cancer biomarkers using an inexpensive and practical platform.\n\n\nExample 3. Direct, Electronic MicroRNA Detection Reveals Differential Expression Profiles in 30 Minutes. \n\n MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nMaterials. 6-mercapto-l-hexanol (97% MCH), hexaamine ruthenium chloride\n\n\n(99.9+%), potassium ferricyanide (99%), and palladium (II) chloride(99.9+%) were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich Canada Ltd (Oakville, ON), perchloric acid (70%), acetone (ACS grade) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA, ACS grade) were obtained from EMD\n\n\n(Gibbstown, NJ). Thiolated PNA oligomers were obtained from Biosynthesis Inc\n\n\n(Lewisville, TX) with HPLC purified grade. PNA probes a Cys-Gly dipeptide at their N- terminus. GIy acts as a spacer, while Cys provides free thiol for immobilization on the electrode surface. Synthetic microRNAs (5' end phosphorylated and HPLC purified) were obtained from Eurofms MWG Operon (Huntsville, AL). All PNA and RNA sequences are shown in table Sl provided in the supporting information.\n\n\nChip fabrication. The chips were fabricated at the Canadian Photonics Fabrication Center. 3\" silicon wafers were passivated using a thick layer of thermally grown silicon dioxide. A 350 run gold layer was deposited on the chip using electron-beam assisted gold evaporation. The gold film was patterned using standard photolithography and a lift-off process. A 500 nm layer of insulating silicon dioxide was deposited using chemical vapor deposition. 500 nm apertures were imprinted on the electrodes using standard photolithography, and 2 mm x 2 mm bond pads were exposed using standard photolithography.\n\n\nFabrication of nanostructured microelectrodes. Chips were cleaned by rinsing in acetone, IPA, and DI water for 30 s and dried with a flow of nitrogen. All electrodeposition was performed at room temperature with a Bioanalytical Systems Epsilon potentiostat with a three-electrode system featuring an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum wire auxiliary electrode. 500 nm apertures on the fabricated electrodes were used as the working electrode and were contacted using the exposed bond pads. A 2 mm portion of the chip was immersed into the plating bath containing 5 mM palladium (II) chloride and 0.5 M perchloric acid, and incubated for about 5 min prior to electroplating. The bond pads were kept free from solution. Pd NMEs were fabricated using DC potential amperometry at an applied potential of -100 mV for 6 s.\n\n\nModification of NMEs with PNA probes. Single-stranded thiolated PNA probes were dissolved in a buffer solution (pH 7) containing 25 mM sodium phosphate and 25 mM \n\n sodium chloride at a concentration of 500 nM. The solution was then heated at 50oC for 10 minutes to fully dissolve the PNA molecules. A suitable amount of 10 mM MCH was then added to make the final MCH concentration of 100 nM. 10 μL of this mixture was quickly deposited on a chip displaying Pd NMEs using a manual micropipettor. This PNA probe solution covered chip was then incubated in a dark humidity chamber overnight at 4oC. The probe-modified Pd NMEs were vigorously rinsed with the above buffer solution before measurements. For multiplexed experiments, chips with eight individually addressable leads were used.\n\n\nTarget hybridization. Hybridization solutions contained various concentrations of targets in 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 25 mM NaCl. Pd NMEs were incubated with 10 μL of target solution at 37°C in a humidity chamber for 30 mins to allow the immobilized probe molecules to hybridize with target molecules. The chip was then cooled and washed vigorously with buffer before the electrochemical analysis.\n\n\nElectrochemical measurements. Electrochemical measurements were performed with an electrochemical analyzer (BASi, West Lafayette, USA) in a solution containing 10 mM Ru(NH3)6 3+, 4 mM Fe(CN)6 3-, 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 25 mM\n\n\nNaCl. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted before and after the addition of target solutions at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was performed at a potential step of 5 mV, pulse amplitude of 50 mV, pulse width of 50 ms and a pulse period of 100 ms. Cyclic voltammetry signals before and after hybridization were collected with a scan rate of 100 mV/s. Limiting reductive current (I) was quantified by subtracting the background at 0 mV from the cathodic current at -300 mV in a cyclic voltammetry signal. Signal changes corresponding to hybridization were calculated as follows: ΔI = (Ids-\n\n\nIss)/Iss x 100 (ss = before hybridization, ds = after hybridization). The detection limit was determined as the first concentration where background (noncomplementary ΔI) subtracted signal was 2 times higher than the standard deviation of 10 fM non-complementary control sample.\n\n\nSEM Imaging. HITACHI S-3400 SEM (Hitachi High Technologies America, Inc.,\n\n\nPleasanton, CA) was employed to study the morphology and dimension of the electroplated NMEs. The chip was affixed on a stainless steel SEM stub using doublesided adhesive black carbon tape. The SEM image was acquired using the secondary electron mode at 20 kV. \n\n RNA extraction for PCR analyses and amplification protocol. Total RNA was extracted from cell lines with mirVana kit (Ambion). The quality of samples was assessed by RT-PCR analysis of the endogenous control RNU44 using Applied Biosystems TaqMan® microRNA Assay. This assay includes a reverse transcription (RT) step using the TaqMan® MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) wherein a stemloop RT primer specifically hybridizes to a mir molecule and is then reverse transcribed with a MultiScribe reverse transcriptase. Briefly, the reverse transcription mix includes 50 nM stem-loop RT primers, Ix RT buffer, 0.25 mM each of dNTPs, 3.33 U/μL MultiScribe reverse transcriptase, and 0.25 U/μl RNase inhibitor. The 7.5 μL reaction was then incubated in an Applied Biosystems 7900 Thermocycler for 30 minutes at 16°C, 30 minutes at 42°C, 5 minutes at 85\n0\nC and then held at 4°C. The RT products were subsequently amplified with sequence-specific primers (hsa-mir-21 primer 4373090, and hsa-mir-205 primer 4373093 from Applied Biosystems) using the Applied Biosystems 7900 HT Real-Time PCR system. The 10 μL PCR mix contains 0.67 μL RT product, 1x4 TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix, 0.2 μM TaqMan® probe, 1.5 μM forward primer and 0.7 μM reverse primer. The reactions were incubated in a 384-well plate at 95°C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95\n0\nC for 15 seconds and 6O\n0\nC for 1 minute.\n\n\nCloning and expression of pre-miRNA-21. cDNA was produced by reverse transcribing 500 ng total RNA from FaDu cells using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer 's instructions. 50 ng of cDNA were used as template for PCR amplification of the premiRNA-21 stem loop with 1 μM of the primers MIR-F (CCT ACC ATC GTG ACA TCT CCA TGG) and MIR-R (ATG AGA ACA TTG GAT ATG GAT GGT). The conditions for the PCR were: 95°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR product was gel purified (Gel extraction kit, Qiagen) and cloned in pCR4-TOPO vector (invitrogen). Colonies were picked and grown in LB medium. Plasmid DNA was purified with Plasmid Mini Kit (Qiagen), and checked for the correct product, orientation, and absence of undesired mutations with sequencing (ACGT corporation). Plasmid DNA was digested with Notl which does not generate 3' protruding ends that produce high background vector RNA during in vitro transcription. 1 μg of linearized plasmid DNA was used as a template for in vitro transcription with AmpliScribeTM T3 High Yield Transcription Kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies). After the completion of reverse transcription, DNase I was added to digest the template DNA and \n\n RNA was purified with PureLink Micro to Midi Total RNA Purification Kit (Invitrogen). Concentration of RNA was determined by reading the absorbance at 260 nm.\n\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\n\nWe endeavored to develop a new method for microRNA profiling that would feature the convenience of array-based analysis, but would augment the power of such multiplexing with the exceptional sensitivity required to assay small biological samples for low abundance microRNAs. Given that conventional fluorescence-based methods are insufficiently sensitive to monitor hybridization of small numbers of molecules to surface - bound probe sequences with simple instrumentation, we instead pursued an approach that employed electronic readout.\n\n\nIn order to provide a platform for electronic microRNA detection, a multiplexed chip was prepared that featured an electrode pattern generated by photolithography. This chip was made using a silicon wafer as a base, and a pattern of gold was deposited on its surface to provide a multiplexed set of leads and external contacts. A layer of SiO was deposited on top of the gold to passivate the metal, and then in the final fabrication step, 500 nanometer apertures were opened on the end of each lead to expose gold. To generate protruding micorelectrodes, palladium was electrodeposited in the apertures. The electrodeposition step was engineered to produce highly nanostructured microelectrodes (NMEs). Previous studies have indicated that nanostructured sensing elements can present biomolecular probes more efficiently than bulk materials and facilitate surface complexation reactions, but this advantage has never been exploited for direct biological profiling.\n\n\nTo test the electronic chip for sensitivity and specificity in microRNA detection, Pd NMEs were modified with PNA probes and exposed to RNA for hybridization. Complexation was assayed using a redox reporter system, previously shown to exhibit femtomolar sensitivity when used in conjunction with nanostructured electrodes and PNA probes. (R. Gasparac, et. al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 12270; Z. Fang, S. O. Kelley, Anal. Chem. 2009, 81, 612; M. A. Lapierre, et al., Anal. Chem. 2003, 75, 6327; M.A. Lapierre-Devlin, et al., Nano Lett. 2005, 5, 1051). This reporter system relies on the accumulation of Ru(III) when nucleic acids hybridize at an electrode surface, and the signals obtained from this reporter are amplified by the inclusion of ferricyanide, which can \n\n regenerate Ru(III) chemically after its electrochemical reduction. Titrations of the miR-21 sequence showed detectable signal changes relative to non-complementary control sequences when solutions containing as little as 10 aM of the target were exposed to the chip-based NMEs. This corresponds to 10 molecules per microliter of sample. The very high level of sensitivity is accompanied by a limited dynamic range of only 10\n2\n, but for the detection of microRNAs, this tradeoff is merited given the low abundance of these sequences.\n\n\nTwo crucial additional sensing criteria are specifically demanded in microRNA detection. First, closely related sequences - different by as few as one base - must be accurately distinguished. Second, sequence appendages like those found in mature vs. precursor microRNAs, must be discriminated. We sought to challenge our system with each of these requirements. We investigated first the specificity of the assay for mature microRNA sequences. This was conducted by analyzing signal changes observed when the chip was exposed to solutions containing either the full-length, double-stranded, precursor form of miR-21, or the significantly shorter, single-stranded, mature miR-21 sequence. The signal obtained for the hairpin precursor structure approached background levels, while a robust signal change was observed for mature miR-21.\n\n\nWe evaluated the sensitivity of the detection approach to point mutations by monitoring the response of probe-modified sensing elements to two closely related sequences, miR-26a and miR-26b. Probes complementary to each sequence were arrayed on the chip, and the response of these elements to the complementary sequences was monitored. The signal obtained when miR-26a was introduced was approximately 4 times for the fully matched miR-26a probe over the mismatched miR-26b probe, and similarly, the signal obtained when miR-26b was introduced was approximately 4.5 -fold higher for the fully matched miR-26b probe over its mismatched counterpart probe. These results indicate that this multiplexed chip can successfully discriminate closely related microRNA sequences.\n\n\nDeriving a \"fingerprint\" of microRNA expression from cell lines representing a particular tumour type relative to normal cells has been previously shown to be a powerful approach to identify microRNAs that can serve as biomarkers in patients. Having confirmed the specificity and sensitivity of the chip towards microRNA targets, we then tested it using RNA samples extracted from human normal cells and those derived from human head and neck squamous cancer cell lines grown in culture. For example, total \n\n RNA extracted from the human hypopharyngeal squamous cancer FaDu cell line and a normal oral epithelial cell line was titrated onto a nanostructured microelectrode displaying a probe complementary to miR -205. A positive signal was obtained with as little as 5 ng of RNA derived from the FaDu cells, while normal epithelial cells did not produce any signal change with up to 20 ng of RNA. This indicates that the signal response corresponds to a unique marker present at significantly higher levels in the cancer cell lines.\n\n\nWe profiled two different microRNAs, miR-21 and miR-205, and also included a control RNA, RNU-44 in a panel of total RNA samples. We employed three different head and neck squamous cancer cell lines, and compared the response of the microelectrode chip to these total RNA samples relative to RNA isolated from normal oral epithelial cells. As expected, RNU -44 levels, as judged by the electrochemical response measured for each total RNA sample exposed to a sensing element modified with a complementary probe, remained constant in all four cell lines. However, miR-21 and miR-205 signals were both significantly elevated in the cancer cell lines. Indeed, the levels of these microRNAs were judged to be present at> 100-fold higher levels in the cancer cell lines relative to the normal epithelial cells. The over-expression of these targets was confirmed using conventional quantitative PCR (see supporting information). Both miR -21 and miR-205 have been previously observed to be elevated in primary human head and neck squamous carcinomas, indicating a significant potential for these micro-RNAs to serve as diagnostic biomarkers for this malignancy.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the microRNA detection chip described here offers the sensitivity and specificity for the analysis of a novel class of nucleic acids biomarkers representing one of the most challenging detection targets. Electronic readout of microRNA profiles offers a rapid - yet highly accurate - method to directly assay RNA samples for specific sequences, and the lack of labeling or amplification renders this approach to be extremely straightforward and efficient, features not attainable with other PCR or hybridization-based approaches."

The invention also relates to nucleic acid constructs, vectors, and host cells comprising the polynucleotides as well as methods of producing and using the polypeptides.\n\n\nDescription of the Related Art\n\n\nPolysaccharides constitute 90% of plant cell walls and can be divided into three groups: cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. Cellulose represents the major constituent of cell wall polysaccharides. Hemicelluloses are the second most abundant constituent of plant cell walls. The major hemicellulose polymer is xylan. The structure of xylans found in cell walls of plants can differ significantly depending on their origin, but they all contain a beta-1 ,4-linked D-xylose backbone. The beta-1 ,4-linked D-xylose backbone can be substituted by various side groups, such as L-aribinose, D-galactose, acetyl, feruloyl, p- coumaroyl, and glucuronic acid residues.\n\n\nThe biodegradation of the xylan backbone depends on two classes of enzymes: endoxylanases and beta-xylosidases. Endoxylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) cleave the xylan backbone into smaller oligosaccharides, which can be further degraded to xylose by beta- xylosidases (EC 3.2.1.37). Other enzymes involved in the degradation of xylan include, for example, acetylxylan esterase, arabinase, alpha-glucuronidase, feruloyl esterase, and p- coumaric acid esterase.

Feruloyl esterase is also known as ferulic acid esterase, hydroxycinnamoyl esterase, FAE-III, cinnamoyl ester hydrolase, FAEA, cinnAE, FAE-I, or FAE-II. A feruloyl esterase of the present invention can also have tannase activity (EC 3.1.1.20). For purposes of the present invention, feruloyl esterase activity is determined using 0.5 mM p-nitrophenylferulate as substrate in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0. One unit of feruloyl esterase activity equals the amount of enzyme capable of releasing 1 μmole of p- nitrophenolate anion per minute at pH 5, 25°C.

Cellulolytic activity: The term \"cellulolytic activity\" is defined herein as a biological activity that hydrolyzes a cellulosic material. The two basic approaches for measuring cellulolytic activity include: (1 ) measuring the total cellulolytic activity, and (2) measuring the individual cellulolytic activities (endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and beta-glucosidases) as reviewed in Zhang et al., Outlook for cellulase improvement: Screening and selection strategies, 2006, Biotechnology Advances 24: 452-481. Total cellulolytic activity is usually measured using insoluble substrates, including Whatman N°1 filter paper, microcrystalline cellulose, bacterial cellulose, algal cellulose, cotton, pretreated lignocellulose, etc. The most common total cellulolytic activity assay is the filter paper assay using Whatman N°1 filter paper as the substrate. The assay was established by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) (Ghose, 1987, Measurement of cellulase activities, Pure Appl.

Endoglucanase activity can be determined based on a reduction in substrate viscosity or increase in reducing ends determined by a reducing sugar assay (Zhang et al., 2006, Biotechnology Advances 24: 452-481 ). For purposes of the present invention, endoglucanase activity is determined using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) hydrolysis according to the procedure of Ghose, 1987, Pure and Appl. Chem. 59: 257-268.\n\n\nCellobiohydrolase: The term \"cellobiohydrolase\" is defined herein as a 1 ,4-beta-D- glucan cellobiohydrolase (E.

Basic Microbiol. 42: 55-66. One unit of beta-glucosidase activity is defined as 1.0 μmole of p-nitrophenol produced per minute at 40\n0\nC, pH 5 from 1 mM p-nitrophenyl-beta-D- glucopyranoside as substrate in 100 mM sodium citrate containing 0.01% TWEEN® 20.\n\n\nCellulolytic enhancing activity: The term \"cellulolytic enhancing activity\" is defined herein as a biological activity that enhances the hydrolysis of a cellulosic material by polypeptides having cellulolytic activity.

The two basic approaches for measuring xylanolytic activity include: (1 ) measuring the total xylanolytic activity, and (2) measuring the individual xylanolytic activities (endoxylanases, beta-xylosidases, arabinofuranosidases, alpha-glucuronidases, acetylxylan esterases, feruloyl esterases, and alpha-glucuronyl esterases). Recent progress in assays of xylanolytic enzymes was summarized in several publications including Biely and Puchard, Recent progress in the assays of xylanolytic enzymes, 2006, Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture 86(1 1 ): 1636-1647; Spanikova and Biely, 2006, Glucuronoyl esterase - Novel carbohydrate esterase produced by Schizophyllum commune, FEBS Letters 580(19): 4597-4601 ; Herrmann, Vrsanska, Jurickova, Hirsch, Biely, and Kubicek, 1997, The beta-D- xylosidase of Trichoderma reesei is a multifunctional beta-D-xylan xylohydrolase, Biochemical Journal 321 : 375-381.\n\n\nTotal xylan degrading activity can be measured by determining the reducing sugars formed from various types of xylan, including oat spelt, beechwood, and larchwood xylans, or by photometric determination of dyed xylan fragments released from various covalently dyed xylans.

Xylan-type polysaccharides can be divided into homoxylans and heteroxylans, which include glucuronoxylans, (arabino)glucuronoxylans, (glucurono)arabinoxylans, arabinoxylans, and complex heteroxylans.

Biol. 48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle program of the\n\n\nEMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et al., 2000, Trends in Genetics 16: 276-277), preferably version 3.0.0 or later. The optional parameters used are gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the\n\n\nEBLOSUM62 (EMBOSS version of BLOSUM62) substitution matrix. The output of Needle labeled \"longest identity\" (obtained using the -nobrief option) is used as the percent identity and is calculated as follows:\n\n\n(Identical Residues x 100)/(Length of Alignment - Total Number of Gaps in Alignment)\n\n\nFor purposes of the present invention, the degree of sequence identity between two deoxyribonucleotide sequences is determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, supra) as implemented in the Needle program of the\n\n\nEMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et al., 2000, supra), preferably version 3.0.0 or later. The optional parameters used are gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EDNAFULL (EMBOSS version of\n\n\nNCBI NUC4.4) substitution matrix.

In one aspect, a fragment contains at least 485 amino acid residues, more preferably at least 510 amino acid residues, and most preferably at least 535 amino acid residues, of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 or a homologous sequence thereof. Subsequence: The term \"subsequence\" is defined herein as a nucleotide sequence having one or more (several) nucleotides deleted from the 5' and/or 3' end of the mature \n\n polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 ; or a homologous sequence thereof; wherein the subsequence encodes a polypeptide fragment having feruloyl esterase activity.

Allelic variation arises naturally through mutation, and may result in polymorphism within populations. Gene mutations can be silent (no change in the encoded polypeptide) or may encode polypeptides having altered amino acid sequences. An allelic variant of a polypeptide is a polypeptide encoded by an allelic variant of a gene.\n\n\nIsolated polynucleotide: The term \"isolated polynucleotide\" as used herein refers to a polynucleotide that is isolated from a source. In a preferred aspect, the polynucleotide is at least 1 % pure, preferably at least 5% pure, more preferably at least 10% pure, more preferably at least 20% pure, more preferably at least 40% pure, more preferably at least 60% pure, even more preferably at least 80% pure, and most preferably at least 90% pure, as determined by agarose electrophoresis.\n\n\nSubstantially pure polynucleotide: The term \"substantially pure polynucleotide\" as used herein refers to a polynucleotide preparation free of other extraneous or unwanted nucleotides and in a form suitable for use within genetically engineered protein production systems.

The polynucleotides may be of genomic, cDNA, RNA, semisynthetic, synthetic origin, or any combinations thereof.\n\n\nCoding sequence: When used herein the term \"coding sequence\" means a \n\n nucleotide sequence, which directly specifies the amino acid sequence of its protein product. The boundaries of the coding sequence are generally determined by an open reading frame, which usually begins with the ATG start codon or alternative start codons such as GTG and TTG and ends with a stop codon such as TAA, TAG, and TGA. The coding sequence may be a DNA, cDNA, synthetic, or recombinant nucleotide sequence. cDNA: The term \"cDNA\" is defined herein as a DNA molecule that can be prepared by reverse transcription from a mature, spliced, mRNA molecule obtained from a eukaryotic cell. cDNA lacks intron sequences that may be present in the corresponding genomic DNA. The initial, primary RNA transcript is a precursor to mRNA that is processed through a series of steps before appearing as mature spliced mRNA. These steps include the removal of intron sequences by a process called splicing. cDNA derived from mRNA lacks, therefore, any intron sequences.\n\n\nNucleic acid construct: The term \"nucleic acid construct\" as used herein refers to a nucleic acid molecule, either single- or double-stranded, which is isolated from a naturally occurring gene or which is modified to contain segments of nucleic acids in a manner that would not otherwise exist in nature or which is synthetic. The term nucleic acid construct is synonymous with the term \"expression cassette\" when the nucleic acid construct contains the control sequences required for expression of a coding sequence of the present invention. Control sequences: The term \"control sequences\" is defined herein to include all components necessary for the expression of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention. Each control sequence may be native or foreign to the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide or native or foreign to each other. Such control sequences include, but are not limited to, a leader, polyadenylation sequence, propeptide sequence, promoter, signal peptide sequence, and transcription terminator. At a minimum, the control sequences include a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals.\n\n\nThe control sequences may be provided with linkers for the purpose of introducing specific restriction sites facilitating ligation of the control sequences with the coding region of the nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide. Operably linked: The term \"operably linked\" denotes herein a configuration in which a control sequence is placed at an appropriate position relative to the coding sequence of a polynucleotide sequence such that the control sequence directs the expression of the coding sequence of a polypeptide.\n\n\nExpression: The term \"expression\" includes any step involved in the production of a polypeptide including, but not limited to, transcription, post-transcriptional modification, translation, post-translational modification, and secretion. \n\n Expression vector: The term \"expression vector\" is defined herein as a linear or circular DNA molecule that comprises a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention and is operably linked to additional nucleotides that provide for its expression. Host cell: The term \"host cell\", as used herein, includes any cell type that is susceptible to transformation, transfection, transduction, and the like with a nucleic acid construct or expression vector comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention.\n\n\nModification: The term \"modification\" means herein any chemical modification of the polypeptide comprising or consisting of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2; or a homologous sequence thereof; as well as genetic manipulation of the DNA encoding such a polypeptide. The modification can be a substitution, a deletion and/or an insertion of one or more (several) amino acids as well as replacements of one or more (several) amino acid side chains.\n\n\nArtificial variant: When used herein, the term \"artificial variant\" means a polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity produced by an organism expressing a modified polynucleotide sequence of the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 ; or a homologous sequence thereof. The modified nucleotide sequence is obtained through human intervention by modification of the polynucleotide sequence disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 1 ; or a homologous sequence thereof.\n\n\nDetailed Description of the Invention\n\n\nPolypeptides Having Feruloyl Esterase Activity\n\n\nIn a first aspect, the present invention relates to isolated polypeptides comprising amino acid sequences having a degree of sequence identity to the mature polypeptide of\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 2 of preferably at least 75%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, even more preferably at least 90%, most preferably at least 95%, and even most preferably at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99%, which have feruloyl esterase activity (hereinafter \"homologous polypeptides\"). In a preferred aspect, the homologous polypeptides comprise amino acid sequences that differ by ten amino acids, preferably by five amino acids, more preferably by four amino acids, even more preferably by three amino acids, most preferably by two amino acids, and even most preferably by one amino acid from the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2.\n\n\nA polypeptide of the present invention preferably comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or an allelic variant thereof; or a fragment thereof having feruloyl esterase activity. In a preferred aspect, the polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence \n\n of SEQ ID NO: 2. In another preferred aspect, the polypeptide comprises the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2. In another preferred aspect, the polypeptide comprises amino acids 26 to 585 of SEQ ID NO: 2, or an allelic variant thereof; or a fragment thereof having feruloyl esterase activity. In another preferred aspect, the polypeptide comprises amino acids 26 to 585 of SEQ ID NO: 2. In another preferred aspect, the polypeptide consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or an allelic variant thereof; or a fragment thereof having feruloyl esterase activity. In another preferred aspect, the polypeptide consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. In another preferred aspect, the polypeptide consists of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2. In another preferred aspect, the polypeptide consists of amino acids 26 to 585 of SEQ ID NO: 2 or an allelic variant thereof; or a fragment thereof having feruloyl esterase activity. In another preferred aspect, the polypeptide consists of amino acids 26 to 585 of SEQ ID NO: 2.\n\n\nIn a second aspect, the present invention relates to isolated polypeptides having feruloyl esterase activity that are encoded by polynucleotides that hybridize under preferably very low stringency conditions, more preferably low stringency conditions, more preferably medium stringency conditions, more preferably medium-high stringency conditions, even more preferably high stringency conditions, and most preferably very high stringency conditions with (i) the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , (ii) the cDNA sequence contained in the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , or (iii) a full-length complementary strand of (i) or (ii) (J. Sambrook, E. F. Fritsch, and T. Maniatis, 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d edition, Cold Spring Harbor, New York).\n\n\nThe nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 ; or a subsequence thereof; as well as the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2; or a fragment thereof; may be used to design nucleic acid probes to identify and clone DNA encoding polypeptides having feruloyl esterase activity from strains of different genera or species according to methods well known in the art. In particular, such probes can be used for hybridization with the genomic or cDNA of the genus or species of interest, following standard Southern blotting procedures, in order to identify and isolate the corresponding gene therein. Such probes can be considerably shorter than the entire sequence, but should be at least 14, preferably at least 25, more preferably at least 35, and most preferably at least 70 nucleotides in length. It is, however, preferred that the nucleic acid probe is at least 100 nucleotides in length. For example, the nucleic acid probe may be at least 200 nucleotides, preferably at least 300 nucleotides, more preferably at least 400 nucleotides, or most preferably at least 500 nucleotides in length. Even longer probes may be used, e.g., nucleic acid probes that are preferably at least 600 nucleotides, more preferably at least 700 nucleotides, even more preferably at least 800 nucleotides, or most preferably at least 900 nucleotides in length. \n\n Both DNA and RNA probes can be used. The probes are typically labeled for detecting the corresponding gene (for example, with \n32\nP, \n3\nH, \n35\nS, biotin, or avidin). Such probes are encompassed by the present invention.\n\n\nA genomic DNA or cDNA library prepared from such other strains may, therefore, be screened for DNA that hybridizes with the probes described above and encodes a polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity. Genomic or other DNA from such other strains may be separated by agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or other separation techniques. DNA from the libraries or the separated DNA may be transferred to and immobilized on nitrocellulose or other suitable carrier material. In order to identify a clone or DNA that is homologous with SEQ ID NO: 1 , or a subsequence thereof, the carrier material is preferably used in a Southern blot.\n\n\nFor purposes of the present invention, hybridization indicates that the nucleotide sequence hybridizes to a labeled nucleic acid probe corresponding to the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 ; the cDNA sequence contained in the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 ; its full-length complementary strand; or a subsequence thereof; under very low to very high stringency conditions. Molecules to which the nucleic acid probe hybridizes under these conditions can be detected using, for example, X-ray film.\n\n\nIn a preferred aspect, the nucleic acid probe is the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. In another preferred aspect, the nucleic acid probe is nucleotides 76 to 1821 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In another preferred aspect, the nucleic acid probe is a polynucleotide sequence that encodes the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, or a subsequence thereof. In another preferred aspect, the nucleic acid probe is SEQ ID NO: 1.\n\n\nIn another preferred aspect, the nucleic acid probe is the polynucleotide sequence contained in plasmid pDFng105 which is contained in E. coli NRRL B-50204, wherein the polynucleotide sequence thereof encodes a polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity. In another preferred aspect, the nucleic acid probe is the mature polypeptide coding region contained in plasmid pDFng105 which is contained in E. coli NRRL B-50204.\n\n\nFor long probes of at least 100 nucleotides in length, very low to very high stringency conditions are defined as prehybridization and hybridization at 42°C in 5X SSPE, 0.3% SDS, 200 μg/ml sheared and denatured salmon sperm DNA, and either 25% formamide for very low and low stringencies, 35% formamide for medium and medium-high stringencies, or 50% formamide for high and very high stringencies, following standard Southern blotting procedures for 12 to 24 hours optimally. For long probes of at least 100 nucleotides in length, the carrier material is finally washed three times each for 15 minutes using 2X SSC, 0.2% SDS preferably at 45°C (very \n\n low stringency), more preferably at 50\n0\nC (low stringency), more preferably at 55°C (medium stringency), more preferably at 60\n0\nC (medium-high stringency), even more preferably at 65°C (high stringency), and most preferably at 70\n0\nC (very high stringency).\n\n\nFor short probes of about 15 nucleotides to about 70 nucleotides in length, stringency conditions are defined as prehybridization, hybridization, and washing post- hybridization at about 5°C to about 10\n0\nC below the calculated T\nm\n using the calculation according to Bolton and McCarthy (1962, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 48:1390) in 0.9 M NaCI, 0.09 M Tris-HCI pH 7.6, 6 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 1X Denhardt's solution, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium monobasic phosphate, 0.1 mM ATP, and 0.2 mg of yeast RNA per ml following standard Southern blotting procedures for 12 to 24 hours optimally.\n\n\nFor short probes of about 15 nucleotides to about 70 nucleotides in length, the carrier material is washed once in 6X SCC plus 0.1% SDS for 15 minutes and twice each for 15 minutes using 6X SSC at 5°C to 10°C below the calculated T\nm\n. In a third aspect, the present invention relates to isolated polypeptides having feruloyl esterase activity encoded by polynucleotides comprising or consisting of nucleotide sequences having a degree of sequence identity to the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 of preferably at least 75%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, even more preferably at least 90%, most preferably at least 95%, and even most preferably at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99%, which encode a polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity. See polynucleotide section herein.\n\n\nIn a fourth aspect, the present invention relates to artificial variants comprising a substitution, deletion, and/or insertion of one or more (or several) amino acids of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, or a homologous sequence thereof. Preferably, amino acid changes are of a minor nature, that is conservative amino acid substitutions or insertions that do not significantly affect the folding and/or activity of the protein; small deletions, typically of one to about 30 amino acids; small amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions, such as an amino-terminal methionine residue; a small linker peptide of up to about 20-25 residues; or a small extension that facilitates purification by changing net charge or another function, such as a poly-histidine tract, an antigenic epitope or a binding domain.\n\n\nExamples of conservative substitutions are within the group of basic amino acids (arginine, lysine and histidine), acidic amino acids (glutamic acid and aspartic acid), polar amino acids (glutamine and asparagine), hydrophobic amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine), and small amino acids (glycine, alanine, serine, threonine and methionine). Amino acid substitutions that do not generally alter specific activity are known in the art and are described, for example, by \n\n H. Neurath and R. L. Hill, 1979, In, The Proteins, Academic Press, New York. The most commonly occurring exchanges are Ala/Ser, Val/lle, Asp/Glu, Thr/Ser, Ala/Gly, Ala/Thr, Ser/Asn, Ala/Val, Ser/Gly, Tyr/Phe, Ala/Pro, Lys/Arg, Asp/Asn, Leu/lle, LeuA/al, Ala/Glu, and Asp/Gly. In addition to the 20 standard amino acids, non-standard amino acids (such as 4- hydroxyproline, 6-Λ/-methyl lysine, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, isovaline, and alpha-methyl serine) may be substituted for amino acid residues of a wild-type polypeptide. A limited number of non-conservative amino acids, amino acids that are not encoded by the genetic code, and unnatural amino acids may be substituted for amino acid residues. \"Unnatural amino acids\" have been modified after protein synthesis, and/or have a chemical structure in their side chain(s) different from that of the standard amino acids. Unnatural amino acids can be chemically synthesized, and preferably, are commercially available, and include pipecolic acid, thiazolidine carboxylic acid, dehydroproline, 3- and 4-methylproline, and 3,3- dimethylproline. Alternatively, the amino acid changes are of such a nature that the physico-chemical properties of the polypeptides are altered. For example, amino acid changes may improve the thermal stability of the polypeptide, alter the substrate specificity, change the pH optimum, and the like.\n\n\nEssential amino acids in the parent polypeptide can be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham and Wells, 1989, Science 244: 1081-1085). In the latter technique, single alanine mutations are introduced at every residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for biological activity (i.e., feruloyl esterase activity) to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. See also, Hilton et al., 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271 : 4699-4708. The active site of the enzyme or other biological interaction can also be determined by physical analysis of structure, as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance, crystallography, electron diffraction, or photoaffinity labeling, in conjunction with mutation of putative contact site amino acids. See, for example, de Vos et al., 1992, Science 255: 306-312; Smith et al., 1992, J. MoI. Biol. 224: 899-904; Wlodaver et al., 1992, FEBS Lett. 309: 59-64. The identities of essential amino acids can also be inferred from analysis of identities with polypeptides that are related to a polypeptide according to the invention.\n\n\nSingle or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions can be made and tested using known methods of mutagenesis, recombination, and/or shuffling, followed by a relevant screening procedure, such as those disclosed by Reidhaar-Olson and Sauer, 1988, Science 241 : 53-57; Bowie and Sauer, 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 2152- \n\n 2156; WO 95/17413; or WO 95/22625. Other methods that can be used include error-prone PCR, phage display (e.g., Lowman et al., 1991 , Biochem. 30: 10832-10837; U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409; WO 92/06204), and region-directed mutagenesis (Derbyshire et al., 1986, Gene 46: 145; tier et al., 1988, DNA 7: 127). Mutagenesis/shuffling methods can be combined with high-throughput, automated screening methods to detect activity of cloned, mutagenized polypeptides expressed by host cells (Ness et al., 1999, Nature Biotechnology 17: 893-896). Mutagenized DNA molecules that encode active polypeptides can be recovered from the host cells and rapidly sequenced using standard methods in the art. These methods allow the rapid determination of the importance of individual amino acid residues in a polypeptide of interest, and can be applied to polypeptides of unknown structure.\n\n\nThe total number of amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 is 10, preferably 9, more preferably 8, more preferably 7, more preferably at most 6, more preferably 5, more preferably 4, even more preferably 3, most preferably 2, and even most preferably 1.\n\n\nSources of Polypeptides Having Feruloyl Esterase Activity\n\n\nA polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity of the present invention may be obtained from microorganisms of any genus. For purposes of the present invention, the term \"obtained from\" as used herein in connection with a given source shall mean that the polypeptide encoded by a nucleotide sequence is produced by the source or by a strain in which the nucleotide sequence from the source has been inserted.

In a preferred aspect, the polypeptide is a Saccharomyces carlsbergensis,\n\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces diastaticus, Saccharomyces douglasii, Saccharomyces kluyveri, Saccharomyces norbensis, or Saccharomyces oviformis polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity.\n\n\nIn another preferred aspect, the polypeptide is an Acremonium cellulolyticus, Aspergillus aculeatus, Aspergillus awamori, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus foetidus, Aspergillus japonicus, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, Chrysosporium keratinophilum, Chrysosporium lucknowense, Chrysosporium tropicum, Chrysosporium merdarium, Chrysosporium inops, Chrysosporium pannicola, Chrysosporium queenslandicum, Chrysosporium zonatum, Fusarium bactridioides, Fusarium cerealis, Fusarium crookwellense, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium graminum, Fusarium heterosporum, Fusarium negundi, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium reticulatum, Fusarium roseum, Fusarium sambucinum, Fusarium sarcochroum, Fusarium sporotrichioides, Fusarium sulphureum, Fusarium torulosum, Fusarium trichothecioides, Fusarium venenatum, Humicola grisea, Humicola insolens, or Humicola lanuginosa, Irpex lacteus, Mucor miehei, Myceliophthora thermophila, Neurospora crassa, Penicillium funiculosum, Penicillium purpurogenum, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Thielavia \n\n achromatica, Thielavia albomyces, Thielavia albopilosa, Thielavia australeinsis, Thielavia fimeti, Thielavia microspora, Thielavia ovispora, Thielavia peruviana, Thielavia spededonium, Thielavia setosa, Thielavia subthermophila, Thielavia terrestris, Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma koningii, Trichoderma Iongibrachiatum, Trichoderma reesei, or Trichoderma viride polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity.\n\n\nIn another preferred aspect, the polypeptide is a Thielavia achromatica, Thielavia albomyces, Thielavia albopilosa, Thielavia australeinsis, Thielavia fimeti, Thielavia microspora, Thielavia ovispora, Thielavia peruviana, Thielavia spededonium, Thielavia setosa, Thielavia subthermophila, or Thielavia terrestris polypeptide. In a more preferred aspect, the polypeptide is a Thielavia terrestris polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity. In a most preferred aspect, the polypeptide is a Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity, e.g., the polypeptide comprising the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2.\n\n\nIt will be understood that for the aforementioned species the invention encompasses both the perfect and imperfect states, and other taxonomic equivalents, e.g., anamorphs, regardless of the species name by which they are known. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize the identity of appropriate equivalents.\n\n\nStrains of these species are readily accessible to the public in a number of culture collections, such as the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSM), Centraalbureau Voor Schimmelcultures (CBS), and Agricultural Research Service Patent Culture Collection, Northern Regional Research Center (NRRL).\n\n\nFurthermore, such polypeptides may be identified and obtained from other sources including microorganisms isolated from nature (e.g., soil, composts, water, etc.) using the above-mentioned probes. Techniques for isolating microorganisms from natural habitats are well known in the art. The polynucleotide may then be obtained by similarly screening a genomic or cDNA library of such a microorganism. Once a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide has been detected with the probe(s), the polynucleotide can be isolated or cloned by utilizing techniques that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et ai, 1989, supra).\n\n\nPolypeptides of the present invention also include fused polypeptides or cleavable fusion polypeptides in which another polypeptide is fused at the N-terminus or the C- terminus of the polypeptide or fragment thereof. A fused polypeptide is produced by fusing a nucleotide sequence (or a portion thereof) encoding another polypeptide to a nucleotide sequence (or a portion thereof) of the present invention. Techniques for producing fusion polypeptides are known in the art, and include ligating the coding sequences encoding the \n\n polypeptides so that they are in frame and that expression of the fused polypeptide is under control of the same promoter(s) and terminator.\n\n\nA fusion polypeptide can further comprise a cleavage site. Upon secretion of the fusion protein, the site is cleaved releasing the polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity from the fusion protein. Examples of cleavage sites include, but are not limited to, a Kex2 site that encodes the dipeptide Lys-Arg (Martin et al., 2003, J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 3: 568-576; Svetina et al., 2000, J. Biotechnol. 76: 245-251 ; Rasmussen-Wilson et al., 1997, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 63: 3488-3493; Ward et al., 1995, Biotechnology 13: 498-503; and Contreras et al., 1991 , Biotechnology 9: 378-381 ), an Ne-(GIu or Asp)-Gly-Arg site, which is cleaved by a Factor Xa protease after the arginine residue (Eaton et al., 1986, Biochem. 25: 505-512); a As p- Asp-Asp- As p-Lys site, which is cleaved by an enterokinase after the lysine (Collins-Racie et al., 1995, Biotechnology 13: 982-987); a His-Tyr-Glu site or His-Tyr-Asp site, which is cleaved by Genenase I (Carter et al., 1989, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics 6: 240-248); a Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser site, which is cleaved by thrombin after the Arg (Stevens, 2003, Drug Discovery World 4: 35-48,); a Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Gly site, which is cleaved by TEV protease after the GIn (Stevens, 2003, supra); and a Leu-Glu-Val- Leu-Phe-Gln-Gly-Pro site, which is cleaved by a genetically engineered form of human rhinovirus 3C protease after the GIn (Stevens, 2003, supra).\n\n\nPolynucleotides\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to isolated polynucleotides comprising or consisting of nucleotide sequences that encode polypeptides having feruloyl esterase activity of the present invention.\n\n\nIn a preferred aspect, the nucleotide sequence comprises or consists of SEQ ID NO: 1. In another more preferred aspect, the nucleotide sequence comprises or consists of the sequence contained in plasmid pDFng105 which is contained in E. coli NRRL B-50204. In another preferred aspect, the nucleotide sequence comprises or consists of the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. In another preferred aspect, the nucleotide sequence comprises or consists of nucleotides 76 to 1821 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In another more preferred aspect, the nucleotide sequence comprises or consists of the mature polypeptide coding sequence contained in plasmid pDFng105 which is contained in E. coli NRRL B-50204. The present invention also encompasses nucleotide sequences that encode polypeptides comprising or consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or the mature polypeptide thereof, which differ from SEQ ID NO: 1 or the mature polypeptide coding sequence thereof by virtue of the degeneracy of the genetic code. The present invention also relates to subsequences of SEQ ID NO: 1 that encode fragments of SEQ ID \n\n NO: 2 having feruloyl esterase activity.\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to mutant polynucleotides comprising or consisting of at least one mutation in the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , in which the mutant nucleotide sequence encodes the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2.\n\n\nThe techniques used to isolate or clone a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide are known in the art and include isolation from genomic DNA, preparation from cDNA, or a combination thereof. The cloning of the polynucleotides of the present invention from such genomic DNA can be effected, e.g., by using the well known polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody screening of expression libraries to detect cloned DNA fragments with shared structural features. See, e.g., lnnis et al., 1990, PCR: A Guide to Methods and Application, Academic Press, New York. Other nucleic acid amplification procedures such as ligase chain reaction (LCR), ligated activated transcription (LAT) and nucleotide sequence-based amplification (NASBA) may be used. The polynucleotides may be cloned from a strain of Thielavia, or another or related organism and thus, for example, may be an allelic or species variant of the polypeptide encoding region of the nucleotide sequence.\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to isolated polynucleotides comprising or consisting of nucleotide sequences having a degree of sequence identity to the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 of preferably at least 75%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, even more preferably at least 90%, most preferably at least 95%, and even most preferably at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99%, which encode a polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity.\n\n\nModification of a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the present invention may be necessary for the synthesis of polypeptides substantially similar to the polypeptide. The term \"substantially similar\" to the polypeptide refers to non-naturally occurring forms of the polypeptide. These polypeptides may differ in some engineered way from the polypeptide isolated from its native source, e.g., artificial variants that differ in specific activity, thermostability, pH optimum, or the like. The variant sequence may be constructed on the basis of the nucleotide sequence presented as the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , e.g., a subsequence thereof, and/or by introduction of nucleotide substitutions that do not give rise to another amino acid sequence of the polypeptide encoded by the nucleotide sequence, but which correspond to the codon usage of the host organism intended for production of the enzyme, or by introduction of nucleotide substitutions that may give rise to a different amino acid sequence. For a general description of nucleotide substitution, see, e.g., Ford et al., 1991 , Protein Expression and Purification 2: 95-107. \n\n It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that such substitutions can be made outside the regions critical to the function of the molecule and still result in an active polypeptide. Amino acid residues essential to the activity of the polypeptide encoded by an isolated polynucleotide of the invention, and therefore preferably not subject to substitution, may be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (see, e.g., Cunningham and Wells, 1989, supra). In the latter technique, mutations are introduced at every positively charged residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for feruloyl esterase activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. Sites of substrate-enzyme interaction can also be determined by analysis of the three-dimensional structure as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, crystallography or photoaffinity labeling (see, e.g., de Vos et al., 1992, supra; Smith et al., 1992, supra; Wlodaver et al., 1992, supra).\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to isolated polynucleotides encoding polypeptides of the present invention, which hybridize under preferably very low stringency conditions, more preferably low stringency conditions, more preferably medium stringency conditions, more preferably medium-high stringency conditions, even more preferably high stringency conditions, and most preferably very high stringency conditions with (i) the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , (ii) the cDNA sequence contained in the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , or (iii) a full-length complementary strand of (i) or (ii); or allelic variants and subsequences thereof (Sambrook et al., 1989, supra), as defined herein.\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to isolated polynucleotides obtained by (a) hybridizing a population of DNA under preferably very low stringency conditions, more preferably low stringency conditions, more preferably medium stringency conditions, more preferably medium-high stringency conditions, even more preferably high stringency conditions, and most preferably very high stringency conditions with (i) the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , (ii) the cDNA sequence contained in the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , or (iii) a full-length complementary strand of (i) or (ii); and (b) isolating the hybridizing polynucleotide, which encodes a polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity.\n\n\nNucleic Acid Constructs\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to nucleic acid constructs comprising an isolated polynucleotide of the present invention operably linked to one or more (several) control sequences that direct the expression of the coding sequence in a suitable host cell under \n\n conditions compatible with the control sequences.\n\n\nAn isolated polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention may be manipulated in a variety of ways to provide for expression of the polypeptide. Manipulation of the polynucleotide's sequence prior to its insertion into a vector may be desirable or necessary depending on the expression vector. The techniques for modifying polynucleotide sequences utilizing recombinant DNA methods are well known in the art.\n\n\nThe control sequence may be an appropriate promoter sequence, a nucleotide sequence that is recognized by a host cell for expression of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention. The promoter sequence contains transcriptional control sequences that mediate the expression of the polypeptide. The promoter may be any nucleotide sequence that shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice including mutant, truncated, and hybrid promoters, and may be obtained from genes encoding extracellular or intracellular polypeptides either homologous or heterologous to the host cell. Examples of suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present invention, especially in a bacterial host cell, are the promoters obtained from the E. coli lac operon, Streptomyces coelicolor agarase gene {dagA), Bacillus subtilis levansucrase gene (sacB), Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase gene (amyL), Bacillus stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase gene (amyM), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase gene {amyQ), Bacillus licheniformis penicillinase gene {penP), Bacillus subtilis xylA and xylB genes, and prokaryotic beta-lactamase gene (Villa-Kamaroff et al., 1978, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 75: 3727-3731 ), as well as the tac promoter (DeBoer et al., 1983, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 80: 21-25). Further promoters are described in \"Useful proteins from recombinant bacteria\" in Scientific American, 1980, 242: 74-94; and in Sambrook et al., 1989, supra.\n\n\nExamples of suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present invention in a filamentous fungal host cell are promoters obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase, Aspergillus niger neutral alpha-amylase, Aspergillus niger acid stable alpha- amylase, Aspergillus niger or Aspergillus awamori glucoamylase {glaA), Rhizomucor miehei lipase, Aspergillus oryzae alkaline protease, Aspergillus oryzae triose phosphate isomerase, Aspergillus nidulans acetamidase, Fusarium venenatum amyloglucosidase (WO 00/56900), Fusarium venenatum Daria (WO 00/56900), Fusarium venenatum Quinn (WO 00/56900), Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease (WO 96/00787), Trichoderma reesei beta- glucosidase, Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase I, Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase II, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase I, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase II, Trichoderma \n\n reesei endoglucanase III, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase IV, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase V, Trichoderma reesei xylanase I, Trichoderma reesei xylanase II, Trichoderma reesei beta-xylosidase, as well as a NA2-tpi promoter (a modified promoter including a gene encoding a neutral alpha-amylase in Aspergilli in which the untranslated leader has been replaced by an untranslated leader from a gene encoding triose phosphate isomerase in Aspergilli; non-limiting examples include modified promoters including the gene encoding neutral alpha-amylase in Aspergillus niger in which the untranslated leader has been replaced by an untranslated leader from the gene encoding triose phosphate isomerase in Aspergillus nidulans or Aspergillus oryzae); and mutant, truncated, and hybrid promoters thereof.\n\n\nIn a yeast host, useful promoters are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase (ENO-1 ), Saccharomyces cerevisiae galactokinase (GAL1 ), Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADH 1 , ADH2/GAP), Saccharomyces cerevisiae triose phosphate isomerase (TPI), Saccharomyces cerevisiae metallothionein (CUP1 ), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. Other useful promoters for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et al., 1992, Yeast 8: 423-488.\n\n\nThe control sequence may also be a suitable transcription terminator sequence, a sequence recognized by a host cell to terminate transcription. The terminator sequence is operably linked to the 3' terminus of the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide. Any terminator that is functional in the host cell of choice may be used in the present invention.\n\n\nPreferred terminators for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Aspergillus nidulans anthranilate synthase, Aspergillus niger alpha-glucosidase, and Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease.\n\n\nPreferred terminators for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome C (CYC1 ), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Other useful terminators for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et al., 1992, supra. The control sequence may also be a suitable leader sequence, a nontranslated region of an mRNA that is important for translation by the host cell. The leader sequence is operably linked to the 5' terminus of the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide. Any leader sequence that is functional in the host cell of choice may be used in the present invention. Preferred leaders for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for\n\n\nAspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase and Aspergillus nidulans triose phosphate isomerase. \n\n Suitable leaders for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase (ENO-1 ), Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADH2/GAP). The control sequence may also be a polyadenylation sequence, a sequence operably linked to the 3' terminus of the nucleotide sequence and, when transcribed, is recognized by the host cell as a signal to add polyadenosine residues to transcribed mRNA. Any polyadenylation sequence that is functional in the host cell of choice may be used in the present invention. Preferred polyadenylation sequences for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Aspergillus nidulans anthranilate synthase, Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease, and Aspergillus niger alpha-glucosidase.\n\n\nUseful polyadenylation sequences for yeast host cells are described by Guo and Sherman, 1995, Molecular Cellular Biology 15: 5983-5990.\n\n\nThe control sequence may also be a signal peptide coding sequence that encodes a signal peptide linked to the amino terminus of a polypeptide and directs the encoded polypeptide into the cell's secretory pathway. The 5' end of the coding sequence of the nucleotide sequence may inherently contain a signal peptide coding sequence naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the coding sequence that encodes the secreted polypeptide. Alternatively, the 5' end of the coding sequence may contain a signal peptide coding sequence that is foreign to the coding sequence. The foreign signal peptide coding sequence may be required where the coding sequence does not naturally contain a signal peptide coding sequence. Alternatively, the foreign signal peptide coding sequence may simply replace the natural signal peptide coding sequence in order to enhance secretion of the polypeptide. However, any signal peptide coding sequence that directs the expressed polypeptide into the secretory pathway of a host cell of choice, i.e., secreted into a culture medium, may be used in the present invention.\n\n\nEffective signal peptide coding sequences for bacterial host cells are the signal peptide coding sequences obtained from the genes for Bacillus NCIB 1 1837 maltogenic amylase, Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase, Bacillus licheniformis subtilisin, Bacillus licheniformis beta-lactamase, Bacillus stearothermophilus neutral proteases {nprT, nprS, nprM), and Bacillus subtilis prsA. Further signal peptides are described by Simonen and Palva, 1993, Microbiological Reviews 57: 109-137. Effective signal peptide coding sequences for filamentous fungal host cells are the signal peptide coding sequences obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA \n\n amylase, Aspergillus niger neutral amylase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase, Humicola insolens cellulase, Humicola insolens endoglucanase V, and Humicola lanuginosa lipase.\n\n\nUseful signal peptides for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor and Saccharomyces cerevisiae invertase. Other useful signal peptide coding sequences are described by Romanos et al., 1992, supra.\n\n\nIn a preferred aspect, the signal peptide comprises or consists of amino acids 1 to 25 of SEQ ID NO: 2. In another preferred aspect, the signal peptide coding sequence comprises or consists of nucleotides 1 to 75 of SEQ ID NO: 1. The control sequence may also be a propeptide coding sequence that encodes a propeptide positioned at the amino terminus of a polypeptide. The resultant polypeptide is known as a proenzyme or propolypeptide (or a zymogen in some cases). A propeptide is generally inactive and can be converted to a mature active polypeptide by catalytic or autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide from the propolypeptide. The propeptide coding sequence may be obtained from the genes for Bacillus subtilis alkaline protease (aprE), Bacillus subtilis neutral protease {nprT), Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor, Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase, and Myceliophthora thermophila laccase (WO 95/33836).\n\n\nWhere both signal peptide and propeptide sequences are present at the amino terminus of a polypeptide, the propeptide sequence is positioned next to the amino terminus of a polypeptide and the signal peptide sequence is positioned next to the amino terminus of the propeptide sequence.\n\n\nIt may also be desirable to add regulatory sequences that allow the regulation of the expression of the polypeptide relative to the growth of the host cell. Examples of regulatory systems are those that cause the expression of the gene to be turned on or off in response to a chemical or physical stimulus, including the presence of a regulatory compound. Regulatory systems in prokaryotic systems include the lac, tac, and trp operator systems. In yeast, the ADH2 system or GAL1 system may be used. In filamentous fungi, the TAKA alpha-amylase promoter, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase promoter, and Aspergillus oryzae glucoamylase promoter may be used as regulatory sequences. Other examples of regulatory sequences are those that allow for gene amplification. In eukaryotic systems, these regulatory sequences include the dihydrofolate reductase gene that is amplified in the presence of methotrexate, and the metallothionein genes that are amplified with heavy metals. In these cases, the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide would be operably linked with the regulatory sequence. \n\n Expression Vectors\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to recombinant expression vectors comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention, a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The various nucleic acids and control sequences described herein may be joined together to produce a recombinant expression vector that may include one or more (several) convenient restriction sites to allow for insertion or substitution of the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide at such sites. Alternatively, a polynucleotide sequence of the present invention may be expressed by inserting the nucleotide sequence or a nucleic acid construct comprising the sequence into an appropriate vector for expression. In creating the expression vector, the coding sequence is located in the vector so that the coding sequence is operably linked with the appropriate control sequences for expression.\n\n\nThe recombinant expression vector may be any vector (e.g., a plasmid or virus) that can be conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures and can bring about expression of the nucleotide sequence. The choice of the vector will typically depend on the compatibility of the vector with the host cell into which the vector is to be introduced. The vectors may be linear or closed circular plasmids.\n\n\nThe vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e., a vector that exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g., a plasmid, an extrachromosomal element, a minichromosome, or an artificial chromosome. The vector may contain any means for assuring self-replication. Alternatively, the vector may be one that, when introduced into the host cell, is integrated into the genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. Furthermore, a single vector or plasmid or two or more vectors or plasmids that together contain the total DNA to be introduced into the genome of the host cell, or a transposon, may be used.\n\n\nThe vectors of the present invention preferably contain one or more (several) selectable markers that permit easy selection of transformed, transfected, transduced, or the like cells. A selectable marker is a gene the product of which provides for biocide or viral resistance, resistance to heavy metals, prototrophy to auxotrophs, and the like. Examples of bacterial selectable markers are the dal genes from Bacillus subtilis or\n\n\nBacillus licheniformis, or markers that confer antibiotic resistance such as ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, or tetracycline resistance. Suitable markers for yeast host cells are ADE2, HIS3, LEU2, LYS2, MET3, TRP1 , and URA3. Selectable markers for use in a filamentous fungal host cell include, but are not limited to, amdS (acetamidase), argB (ornithine carbamoyltransferase), bar (phosphinothricin acetyltransferase), hph (hygromycin phosphotransferase), niaD (nitrate reductase), pyrG (orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase), \n\n sC (sulfate adenyltransferase), and trpC (anthranilate synthase), as well as equivalents thereof. Preferred for use in an Aspergillus cell are the amdS and pyrG genes of Aspergillus nidulans or Aspergillus oryzae and the bar gene of Streptomyces hygroscopicus.\n\n\nThe vectors of the present invention preferably contain an element(s) that permits integration of the vector into the host cell's genome or autonomous replication of the vector in the cell independent of the genome.\n\n\nFor integration into the host cell genome, the vector may rely on the polynucleotide's sequence encoding the polypeptide or any other element of the vector for integration into the genome by homologous or nonhomologous recombination. Alternatively, the vector may contain additional nucleotide sequences for directing integration by homologous recombination into the genome of the host cell at a precise location(s) in the chromosome(s). To increase the likelihood of integration at a precise location, the integrational elements should preferably contain a sufficient number of nucleic acids, such as 100 to 10,000 base pairs, preferably 400 to 10,000 base pairs, and most preferably 800 to 10,000 base pairs, which have a high degree of sequence identity to the corresponding target sequence to enhance the probability of homologous recombination. The integrational elements may be any sequence that is homologous with the target sequence in the genome of the host cell. Furthermore, the integrational elements may be non-encoding or encoding nucleotide sequences. On the other hand, the vector may be integrated into the genome of the host cell by non-homologous recombination.\n\n\nFor autonomous replication, the vector may further comprise an origin of replication enabling the vector to replicate autonomously in the host cell in question. The origin of replication may be any plasmid replicator mediating autonomous replication that functions in a cell. The term \"origin of replication\" or \"plasmid replicator\" is defined herein as a nucleotide sequence that enables a plasmid or vector to replicate in vivo.\n\n\nExamples of bacterial origins of replication are the origins of replication of plasmids pBR322, pUC19, pACYC177, and pACYC184 permitting replication in E. coli, and pUB1 10, pE194, pTA1060, and pAMβi permitting replication in Bacillus.\n\n\nExamples of origins of replication for use in a yeast host cell are the 2 micron origin of replication, ARS1 , ARS4, the combination of ARS1 and CEN3, and the combination of ARS4 and CEN6.\n\n\nExamples of origins of replication useful in a filamentous fungal cell are AMA1 and ANSI (Gems et ai, 1991 , Gene 98: 61-67; Cullen et ai, 1987, Nucleic Acids Research 15: 9163-9175; WO 00/24883). Isolation of the AMA1 gene and construction of plasmids or vectors comprising the gene can be accomplished according to the methods disclosed in WO 00/24883. \n\n More than one copy of a polynucleotide of the present invention may be inserted into a host cell to increase production of the gene product. An increase in the copy number of the polynucleotide can be obtained by integrating at least one additional copy of the sequence into the host cell genome or by including an amplifiable selectable marker gene with the polynucleotide where cells containing amplified copies of the selectable marker gene, and thereby additional copies of the polynucleotide, can be selected for by cultivating the cells in the presence of the appropriate selectable agent.\n\n\nThe procedures used to ligate the elements described above to construct the recombinant expression vectors of the present invention are well known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et ai, 1989, supra).\n\n\nHost Cells\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to recombinant host cells, comprising an isolated polynucleotide of the present invention operably linked to one or more (several) control sequences that direct the production of a polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity. A construct or vector comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention is introduced into a host cell so that the construct or vector is maintained as a chromosomal integrant or as a self-replicating extra-chromosomal vector as described earlier. The term \"host cell\" encompasses any progeny of a parent cell that is not identical to the parent cell due to mutations that occur during replication. The choice of a host cell will to a large extent depend upon the gene encoding the polypeptide and its source.\n\n\nThe host cell may be any cell useful in the recombinant production of a polypeptide of the present invention, e.g., a prokaryote or a eukaryote.\n\n\nThe prokaryotic host cell may be any Gram positive bacterium or a Gram negative bacterium. Gram positive bacteria include, but not limited to, Bacillus, Streptococcus, Streptomyces, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Clostridium, Geobacillus, and Oceanobacillus. Gram negative bacteria include, but not limited to, E. coli, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Helicobacter, Flavobacterium, Fusobacterium, llyobacter, Neisseria, and Ureaplasma. The bacterial host cell may be any Bacillus cell. Bacillus cells useful in the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, Bacillus alkalophilus, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus clausii, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus firmus, Bacillus lautus, Bacillus lentus, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus thuringiensis cells.\n\n\nIn a preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens cell. In \n\n another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Bacillus clausii cell. In another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Bacillus lentus cell. In another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Bacillus licheniformis cell. In another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Bacillus stearothermophilus cell. In another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Bacillus subtilis cell.\n\n\nThe bacterial host cell may also be any Streptococcus cell. Streptococcus cells useful in the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, Streptococcus equisimilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus uberis, and Streptococcus equi subsp. Zooepidemicus cells. In a preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Streptococcus equisimilis cell. In another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Streptococcus pyogenes cell. In another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Streptococcus uberis cell. In another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Streptococcus equi subsp. Zooepidemicus cell.\n\n\nThe bacterial host cell may also be any Streptomyces cell. Streptomyces cells useful in the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, Streptomyces achromogenes, Streptomyces avermitilis, Streptomyces coelicolor, Streptomyces griseus, and Streptomyces lividans cells.\n\n\nIn a preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Streptomyces achromogenes cell. In another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Streptomyces avermitilis cell. In another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Streptomyces coelicolor cell. In another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Streptomyces griseus cell. In another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Streptomyces lividans cell.\n\n\nThe introduction of DNA into a Bacillus cell may, for instance, be effected by protoplast transformation (see, e.g., Chang and Cohen, 1979, Molecular General Genetics 168: 1 11-1 15), by using competent cells (see, e.g., Young and Spizizen, 1961 , Journal of Bacteriology 81 : 823-829, or Dubnau and Davidoff-Abelson, 1971 , Journal of Molecular Biology 56: 209-221 ), by electroporation (see, e.g., Shigekawa and Dower, 1988, Biotechniques 6: 742-751 ), or by conjugation (see, e.g., Koehler and Thorne, 1987, Journal of Bacteriology 169: 5271-5278). The introduction of DNA into an E coli cell may, for instance, be effected by protoplast transformation (see, e.g., Hanahan, 1983, J. MoI. Biol. 166: 557-580) or electroporation (see, e.g., Dower et al., 1988, Nucleic Acids Res. 16: 6127- 6145). The introduction of DNA into a Streptomyces cell may, for instance, be effected by protoplast transformation and electroporation (see, e.g., Gong et al., 2004, Folia Microbiol. (Praha) 49: 399-405), by conjugation (see, e.g., Mazodier et al., 1989, J. Bacteriol. 171 : 3583-3585), or by transduction (see, e.g., Burke et al., 2001 , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98: 6289-6294). The introduction of DNA into a Pseudomonas cell may, for instance, be \n\n effected by electroporation (see, e.g., Choi et al., 2006, J. Microbiol. Methods 64: 391-397) or by conjugation (see, e.g., Pinedo and Smets, 2005, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 71 : 51-57). The introduction of DNA into a Streptococcus cell may, for instance, be effected by natural competence (see, e.g., Perry and Kuramitsu, 1981 , Infect. Immun. 32: 1295-1297), by protoplast transformation (see, e.g., Catt and Jollick, 1991 , Microbios. 68: 189-207, by electroporation (see, e.g., Buckley et al., 1999, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65: 3800-3804) or by conjugation (see, e.g., Clewell, 1981 , Microbiol. Rev. 45: 409-436). However, any method known in the art for introducing DNA into a host cell can be used.\n\n\nThe host cell may also be a eukaryote, such as a mammalian, insect, plant, or fungal cell.\n\n\nIn a preferred aspect, the host cell is a fungal cell. \"Fungi\" as used herein includes the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Zygomycota (as defined by Hawksworth et al., In, Ainsworth and Bisby's Dictionary of The Fungi, 8th edition, 1995, CAB International, University Press, Cambridge, UK) as well as the Oomycota (as cited in Hawksworth et al., 1995, supra, page 171 ) and all mitosporic fungi (Hawksworth et al., 1995, supra).\n\n\nIn a more preferred aspect, the fungal host cell is a yeast cell. \"Yeast\" as used herein includes ascosporogenous yeast (Endomycetales), basidiosporogenous yeast, and yeast belonging to the Fungi lmperfecti (Blastomycetes). Since the classification of yeast may change in the future, for the purposes of this invention, yeast shall be defined as described in Biology and Activities of Yeast (Skinner, F.A., Passmore, S. M., and Davenport, R. R., eds, Soc. App. Bacteriol. Symposium Series No. 9, 1980).\n\n\nIn an even more preferred aspect, the yeast host cell is a Candida, Hansenula, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, Saccharomyces, Schizosaccharomyces, or Yarrowia cell.

Suitable procedures for transformation of Aspergillus and Trichoderma host cells are described in EP 238 023 and Yelton et al., 1984, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 81 : 1470-1474. Suitable methods for transforming Fusarium species are described by Malardier et al., 1989, Gene 78: 147-156, and WO 96/00787. Yeast may be transformed using the procedures described by Becker and Guarente, In Abelson, J.N. and Simon, M. I., editors, Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology, Methods in Enzymology, Volume 194, pp 182-187, Academic Press, Inc., New York; lto et al., 1983, Journal of Bacteriology 153: 163; and Hinnen et al., 1978, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 75: 1920.\n\n\nMethods of Production The present invention also relates to methods of producing a polypeptide of the present invention, comprising: (a) cultivating a cell, which in its wild-type form produces the polypeptide, under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide; and (b) recovering the polypeptide. In a preferred aspect, the cell is of the genus Thielavia. In a more preferred aspect, the cell is Thielavia terrestris. In a most preferred aspect, the cell is Thielavia terrestris N RRL 8126.\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to methods of producing a polypeptide of the present invention, comprising: (a) cultivating a recombinant host cell, as described herein, under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide; and (b) recovering the polypeptide. The present invention also relates to methods of producing a polypeptide of the present invention, comprising: (a) cultivating a recombinant host cell under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide, wherein the host cell comprises a mutant nucleotide sequence having at least one mutation in the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , wherein the mutant nucleotide sequence encodes a polypeptide that comprises or consists of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2; and (b) recovering the polypeptide.\n\n\nIn the production methods of the present invention, the cells are cultivated in a nutrient medium suitable for production of the polypeptide using methods well known in the art. For example, the cell may be cultivated by shake flask cultivation, and small-scale or large-scale fermentation (including continuous, batch, fed-batch, or solid state fermentations) in laboratory or industrial fermentors performed in a suitable medium and \n\n under conditions allowing the polypeptide to be expressed and/or isolated. The cultivation takes place in a suitable nutrient medium comprising carbon and nitrogen sources and inorganic salts, using procedures known in the art. Suitable media are available from commercial suppliers or may be prepared according to published compositions (e.g., in catalogues of the American Type Culture Collection). If the polypeptide is secreted into the nutrient medium, the polypeptide can be recovered directly from the medium. If the polypeptide is not secreted into the medium, it can be recovered from cell lysates.\n\n\nThe polypeptides may be detected using methods known in the art that are specific for the polypeptides. These detection methods may include use of specific antibodies, formation of an enzyme product, or disappearance of an enzyme substrate. For example, an enzyme assay may be used to determine the activity of the polypeptide as described herein.\n\n\nThe resulting polypeptide may be recovered using methods known in the art. For example, the polypeptide may be recovered from the nutrient medium by conventional procedures including, but not limited to, centrifugation, filtration, extraction, spray-drying, evaporation, or precipitation.\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the present invention may be purified by a variety of procedures known in the art including, but not limited to, chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, hydrophobic, chromatofocusing, and size exclusion), electrophoretic procedures (e.g., preparative isoelectric focusing), differential solubility (e.g., ammonium sulfate precipitation), SDS-PAGE, or extraction (see, e.g., Protein Purification, J. -C. Janson and Lars Ryden, editors, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989) to obtain substantially pure polypeptides.\n\n\nPlants The present invention also relates to plants, e.g., a transgenic plant, plant part, or plant cell, comprising an isolated polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity of the present invention so as to express and produce the polypeptide in recoverable quantities. The polypeptide may be recovered from the plant or plant part. Alternatively, the plant or plant part containing the recombinant polypeptide may be used as such for improving the quality of a food or feed, e.g., improving nutritional value, palatability, and rheological properties, or to destroy an antinutritive factor.\n\n\nThe transgenic plant can be dicotyledonous (a dicot) or monocotyledonous (a monocot). Examples of monocot plants are grasses, such as meadow grass (blue grass, Poa), forage grass such as Festuca, Lolium, temperate grass, such as Agrostis, and cereals, e.g., wheat, oats, rye, barley, rice, sorghum, and maize (corn).\n\n\nExamples of dicot plants are tobacco, legumes, such as lupins, potato, sugar beet, \n\n pea, bean and soybean, and cruciferous plants (family Brassicaceae), such as cauliflower, rape seed, and the closely related model organism Arabidopsis thaliana.\n\n\nExamples of plant parts are stem, callus, leaves, root, fruits, seeds, and tubers as well as the individual tissues comprising these parts, e.g., epidermis, mesophyll, parenchyme, vascular tissues, meristems. Specific plant cell compartments, such as chloroplasts, apoplasts, mitochondria, vacuoles, peroxisomes and cytoplasm are also considered to be a plant part. Furthermore, any plant cell, whatever the tissue origin, is considered to be a plant part. Likewise, plant parts such as specific tissues and cells isolated to facilitate the utilisation of the invention are also considered plant parts, e.g., embryos, endosperms, aleurone and seeds coats.\n\n\nAlso included within the scope of the present invention are the progeny of such plants, plant parts, and plant cells.\n\n\nThe transgenic plant or plant cell expressing a polypeptide of the present invention may be constructed in accordance with methods known in the art. In short, the plant or plant cell is constructed by incorporating one or more (several) expression constructs encoding a polypeptide of the present invention into the plant host genome or chloroplast genome and propagating the resulting modified plant or plant cell into a transgenic plant or plant cell.\n\n\nThe expression construct is conveniently a nucleic acid construct that comprises a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention operably linked with appropriate regulatory sequences required for expression of the nucleotide sequence in the plant or plant part of choice. Furthermore, the expression construct may comprise a selectable marker useful for identifying host cells into which the expression construct has been integrated and DNA sequences necessary for introduction of the construct into the plant in question (the latter depends on the DNA introduction method to be used).\n\n\nThe choice of regulatory sequences, such as promoter and terminator sequences and optionally signal or transit sequences, is determined, for example, on the basis of when, where, and how the polypeptide is desired to be expressed. For instance, the expression of the gene encoding a polypeptide of the present invention may be constitutive or inducible, or may be developmental, stage or tissue specific, and the gene product may be targeted to a specific tissue or plant part such as seeds or leaves. Regulatory sequences are, for example, described by Tague et al., 1988, Plant Physiology 86: 506.\n\n\nFor constitutive expression, the 35S-CaMV, the maize ubiquitin 1 , and the rice actin 1 promoter may be used (Franck et al., 1980, Cell 21 : 285-294; Christensen et al., 1992, Plant MoI. Biol. 18: 675-689; Zhang et al., 1991 , Plant Cell 3: 1155-1 165). Organ-specific promoters may be, for example, a promoter from storage sink tissues such as seeds, potato \n\n tubers, and fruits (Edwards and Coruzzi, 1990, Ann. Rev. Genet. 24: 275-303), or from metabolic sink tissues such as meristems (Ito et al., 1994, Plant MoI. Biol. 24: 863-878), a seed specific promoter such as the glutelin, prolamin, globulin, or albumin promoter from rice (Wu et al., 1998, Plant and Cell Physiology 39: 885-889), a Vicia faba promoter from the legumin B4 and the unknown seed protein gene from Vicia faba (Conrad et al., 1998, Journal of Plant Physiology 152: 708-71 1 ), a promoter from a seed oil body protein (Chen et al., 1998, Plant and Cell Physiology 39: 935-941 ), the storage protein napA promoter from Brassica napus, or any other seed specific promoter known in the art, e.g., as described in WO 91/14772. Furthermore, the promoter may be a leaf specific promoter such as the rbcs promoter from rice or tomato (Kyozuka et al., 1993, Plant Physiology 102: 991-1000, the chlorella virus adenine methyltransferase gene promoter (Mitra and Higgins, 1994, Plant Molecular Biology 26: 85-93), or the aldP gene promoter from rice (Kagaya et al., 1995, Molecular and General Genetics 248: 668-674), or a wound inducible promoter such as the potato pin2 promoter (Xu et al., 1993, Plant Molecular Biology 22: 573-588). Likewise, the promoter may inducible by abiotic treatments such as temperature, drought, or alterations in salinity or induced by exogenously applied substances that activate the promoter, e.g., ethanol, oestrogens, plant hormones such as ethylene, abscisic acid, and gibberellic acid, and heavy metals.\n\n\nA promoter enhancer element may also be used to achieve higher expression of a polypeptide of the present invention in the plant. For instance, the promoter enhancer element may be an intron that is placed between the promoter and the nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the present invention. For instance, Xu et al., 1993, supra, disclose the use of the first intron of the rice actin 1 gene to enhance expression.\n\n\nThe selectable marker gene and any other parts of the expression construct may be chosen from those available in the art.\n\n\nThe nucleic acid construct is incorporated into the plant genome according to conventional techniques known in the art, including Agrobacterium-meύlateύ transformation, virus-mediated transformation, microinjection, particle bombardment, biolistic transformation, and electroporation (Gasser et al., 1990, Science 244: 1293; Potrykus, 1990, Bio/Technology 8: 535; Shimamoto et al., 1989, Nature 338: 274).\n\n\nPresently, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-meώateύ gene transfer is the method of choice for generating transgenic dicots (for a review, see Hooykas and Schilperoort, 1992, Plant Molecular Biology 19: 15-38) and can also be used for transforming monocots, although other transformation methods are often used for these plants. Presently, the method of choice for generating transgenic monocots is particle bombardment (microscopic gold or tungsten particles coated with the transforming DNA) of embryonic calli or \n\n developing embryos (Christou, 1992, Plant Journal 2: 275-281 ; Shimamoto, 1994, Current Opinion Biotechnology 5: 158-162; Vasil et al., 1992, Bio/Technology 10: 667-674). An alternative method for transformation of monocots is based on protoplast transformation as described by Omirulleh et al., 1993, Plant Molecular Biology 21 : 415-428. Additional transformation methods for use in accordance with the present disclosure include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,395,966 and 7,151 ,204 (both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety).\n\n\nFollowing transformation, the transformants having incorporated the expression construct are selected and regenerated into whole plants according to methods well-known in the art. Often the transformation procedure is designed for the selective elimination of selection genes either during regeneration or in the following generations by using, for example, co-transformation with two separate T-DNA constructs or site specific excision of the selection gene by a specific recombinase.\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to methods of producing a polypeptide of the present invention comprising: (a) cultivating a transgenic plant or a plant cell comprising a polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity of the present invention under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide; and (b) recovering the polypeptide.\n\n\nIn embodiments, in addition to direct transformation of a particular plant genotype with a construct prepared according to the present invention, transgenic plants may be made by crossing a plant having a construct of the present invention to a second plant lacking the construct. For example, a construct encoding a polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity or a portion thereof can be introduced into a particular plant variety by crossing, without the need for ever directly transforming a plant of that given variety. Therefore, the present invention not only encompasses a plant directly regenerated from cells which have been transformed in accordance with the present invention, but also the progeny of such plants. As used herein, progeny may refer to the offspring of any generation of a parent plant prepared in accordance with the present invention. Such progeny may include a DNA construct prepared in accordance with the present invention, or a portion of a DNA construct prepared in accordance with the present invention. In embodiments, crossing results in a transgene of the present invention being introduced into a plant line by cross pollinating a starting line with a donor plant line that includes a transgene of the present invention. Non-limiting examples of such steps are further articulated in U.S. Patent No: 7,151 ,204. It is envisioned that plants including a polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity of the present invention include plants generated through a process of backcross conversion. \n\n For examples, plants of the present invention include plants referred to as a backcross converted genotype, line, inbred, or hybrid.\n\n\nIn embodiments, genetic markers may be used to assist in the introgression of one or more transgenes of the invention from one genetic background into another. Marker assisted selection offers advantages relative to conventional breeding in that it can be used to avoid errors caused by phenotypic variations. Further, genetic markers may provide data regarding the relative degree of elite germplasm in the individual progeny of a particular cross. For example, when a plant with a desired trait which otherwise has a non- agronomically desirable genetic background is crossed to an elite parent, genetic markers may be used to select progeny which not only possess the trait of interest, but also have a relatively large proportion of the desired germplasm. In this way, the number of generations required to introgress one or more traits into a particular genetic background is minimized.\n\n\nRemoval or Reduction of Feruloyl Esterase Activity The present invention also relates to methods of producing a mutant of a parent cell, which comprises disrupting or deleting a polynucleotide, or a portion thereof, encoding a polypeptide of the present invention, which results in the mutant cell producing less of the polypeptide than the parent cell when cultivated under the same conditions.\n\n\nThe mutant cell may be constructed by reducing or eliminating expression of a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the present invention using methods well known in the art, for example, insertions, disruptions, replacements, or deletions. In a preferred aspect, the nucleotide sequence is inactivated. The nucleotide sequence to be modified or inactivated may be, for example, the coding region or a part thereof essential for activity, or a regulatory element required for the expression of the coding region. An example of such a regulatory or control sequence may be a promoter sequence or a functional part thereof, i.e., a part that is sufficient for affecting expression of the nucleotide sequence. Other control sequences for possible modification include, but are not limited to, a leader, polyadenylation sequence, propeptide sequence, signal peptide sequence, transcription terminator, and transcriptional activator. Modification or inactivation of the nucleotide sequence may be performed by subjecting the parent cell to mutagenesis and selecting for mutant cells in which expression of the nucleotide sequence has been reduced or eliminated. The mutagenesis, which may be specific or random, may be performed, for example, by use of a suitable physical or chemical mutagenizing agent, by use of a suitable oligonucleotide, or by subjecting the DNA sequence to PCR generated mutagenesis. Furthermore, the mutagenesis may be performed by use of any combination of these mutagenizing agents. \n\n Examples of a physical or chemical mutagenizing agent suitable for the present purpose include ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, hydroxylamine, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N- nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), O-methyl hydroxylamine, nitrous acid, ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS), sodium bisulphite, formic acid, and nucleotide analogues. When such agents are used, the mutagenesis is typically performed by incubating the parent cell to be mutagenized in the presence of the mutagenizing agent of choice under suitable conditions, and screening and/or selecting for mutant cells exhibiting reduced or no expression of the gene.\n\n\nModification or inactivation of the nucleotide sequence may be accomplished by introduction, substitution, or removal of one or more (several) nucleotides in the gene or a regulatory element required for the transcription or translation thereof. For example, nucleotides may be inserted or removed so as to result in the introduction of a stop codon, the removal of the start codon, or a change in the open reading frame. Such modification or inactivation may be accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis or PCR generated mutagenesis in accordance with methods known in the art. Although, in principle, the modification may be performed in vivo, i.e., directly on the cell expressing the nucleotide sequence to be modified, it is preferred that the modification be performed in vitro as exemplified below.\n\n\nAn example of a convenient way to eliminate or reduce expression of a nucleotide sequence by a cell is based on techniques of gene replacement, gene deletion, or gene disruption. For example, in the gene disruption method, a nucleic acid sequence corresponding to the endogenous nucleotide sequence is mutagenized in vitro to produce a defective nucleic acid sequence that is then transformed into the parent cell to produce a defective gene. By homologous recombination, the defective nucleic acid sequence replaces the endogenous nucleotide sequence. It may be desirable that the defective nucleotide sequence also encodes a marker that may be used for selection of transformants in which the nucleotide sequence has been modified or destroyed. In a particularly preferred aspect, the nucleotide sequence is disrupted with a selectable marker such as those described herein. Alternatively, modification or inactivation of the nucleotide sequence may be performed by established anti-sense or RNAi techniques using a sequence complementary to the nucleotide sequence. More specifically, expression of the nucleotide sequence by a cell may be reduced or eliminated by introducing a sequence complementary to the nucleotide sequence of the gene that may be transcribed in the cell and is capable of hybridizing to the mRNA produced in the cell. Under conditions allowing the complementary anti-sense nucleotide sequence to hybridize to the mRNA, the amount of protein translated \n\n is thus reduced or eliminated.\n\n\nThe present invention further relates to a mutant cell of a parent cell that comprises a disruption or deletion of a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide or a control sequence thereof, which results in the mutant cell producing less of the polypeptide or no polypeptide compared to the parent cell.\n\n\nThe polypeptide-deficient mutant cells so created are particularly useful as host cells for the expression of native and/or heterologous polypeptides. Therefore, the present invention further relates to methods of producing a native or heterologous polypeptide, comprising: (a) cultivating the mutant cell under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide; and (b) recovering the polypeptide. The term \"heterologous polypeptides\" is defined herein as polypeptides that are not native to the host cell, a native protein in which modifications have been made to alter the native sequence, or a native protein whose expression is quantitatively altered as a result of a manipulation of the host cell by recombinant DNA techniques. In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a method of producing a protein product essentially free of feruloyl esterase activity by fermentation of a cell that produces both a polypeptide of the present invention as well as the protein product of interest by adding an effective amount of an agent capable of inhibiting feruloyl esterase activity to the fermentation broth before, during, or after the fermentation has been completed, recovering the product of interest from the fermentation broth, and optionally subjecting the recovered product to further purification.\n\n\nIn a further aspect, the present invention relates to a method of producing a protein product essentially free of feruloyl esterase activity by cultivating the cell under conditions permitting the expression of the product, subjecting the resultant culture broth to a combined pH and temperature treatment so as to reduce the feruloyl esterase activity substantially, and recovering the product from the culture broth. Alternatively, the combined pH and temperature treatment may be performed on an enzyme preparation recovered from the culture broth. The combined pH and temperature treatment may optionally be used in combination with a treatment with an feruloyl esterase inhibitor. In accordance with this aspect of the invention, it is possible to remove at least 60%, preferably at least 75%, more preferably at least 85%, still more preferably at least 95%, and most preferably at least 99% of the feruloyl esterase activity. Complete removal of feruloyl esterase activity may be obtained by use of this method.\n\n\nThe combined pH and temperature treatment is preferably carried out at a pH in the range of 2-4 or 9-1 1 and a temperature in the range of at least 60-70\n0\nC for a sufficient period of time to attain the desired effect, where typically, 30 to 60 minutes is sufficient. \n\n The methods used for cultivation and purification of the product of interest may be performed by methods known in the art.\n\n\nThe methods of the present invention for producing an essentially feruloyl esterase- free product is of particular interest in the production of eukaryotic polypeptides, in particular fungal proteins such as enzymes. The enzyme may be selected from, e.g., an amylolytic enzyme, lipolytic enzyme, proteolytic enzyme, cellulolytic enzyme, oxidoreductase, or plant cell-wall degrading enzyme. Examples of such enzymes include an aminopeptidase, amylase, amyloglucosidase, carbohydrase, carboxypeptidase, catalase, cellobiohydrolase, cellulase, chitinase, cutinase, cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase, deoxyribonuclease, endoglucanase, esterase, galactosidase, beta-galactosidase, glucoamylase, glucose oxidase, glucosidase, haloperoxidase, hemicellulase, invertase, isomerase, laccase, ligase, lipase, lyase, mannosidase, oxidase, pectinolytic enzyme, peroxidase, phytase, phenoloxidase, polyphenoloxidase, proteolytic enzyme, ribonuclease, transferase, transglutaminase, or xylanase. The feruloyl esterase-deficient cells may also be used to express heterologous proteins of pharmaceutical interest such as hormones, growth factors, receptors, and the like.\n\n\nIt will be understood that the term \"eukaryotic polypeptides\" includes not only native polypeptides, but also those polypeptides, e.g., enzymes, which have been modified by amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions, or other such modifications to enhance activity, thermostability, pH tolerance and the like.\n\n\nIn a further aspect, the present invention relates to a protein product essentially free from feruloyl esterase activity that is produced by a method of the present invention.\n\n\nMethods of Inhibiting Expression of a Polypeptide Having Feruloyl Esterase Activity The present invention also relates to methods of inhibiting the expression of a polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity in a cell, comprising administering to the cell or expressing in the cell a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule, wherein the dsRNA comprises a subsequence of a polynucleotide of the present invention. In a preferred aspect, the dsRNA is about 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 22, 23, 24, 25 or more duplex nucleotides in length.\n\n\nThe dsRNA is preferably a small interfering RNA (siRNA) or a micro RNA (miRNA). In a preferred aspect, the dsRNA is small interfering RNA (siRNAs) for inhibiting transcription. In another preferred aspect, the dsRNA is micro RNA (miRNAs) for inhibiting translation. The present invention also relates to such double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, comprising a portion of the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 for \n\n inhibiting expression of a polypeptide in a cell. While the present invention is not limited by any particular mechanism of action, the dsRNA can enter a cell and cause the degradation of a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) of similar or identical sequences, including endogenous mRNAs. When a cell is exposed to dsRNA, mRNA from the homologous gene is selectively degraded by a process called RNA interference (RNAi).\n\n\nThe dsRNAs of the present invention can be used in gene-silencing. In one aspect, the invention provides methods to selectively degrade RNA using the dsRNAis of the present invention. The process may be practiced in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo. In one aspect, the dsRNA molecules can be used to generate a loss-of-function mutation in a cell, an organ or an animal. Methods for making and using dsRNA molecules to selectively degrade RNA are well known in the art, see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,506,559; U.S. Patent No. 6,51 1 ,824; U.S. Patent No. 6,515,109; and U.S. Patent No. 6,489,127.\n\n\nCompositions The present invention also relates to compositions comprising a polypeptide of the present invention. Preferably, the compositions are enriched in such a polypeptide. The term \"enriched\" indicates that the feruloyl esterase activity of the composition has been increased, e.g., with an enrichment factor of at least 1.1.\n\n\nThe composition may comprise a polypeptide of the present invention as the major enzymatic component, e.g., a mono-component composition. Alternatively, the composition may comprise multiple enzymatic activities, such as an aminopeptidase, amylase, carbohydrase, carboxypeptidase, catalase, cellulase, chitinase, cutinase, cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase, deoxyribonuclease, esterase, alpha-galactosidase, beta-galactosidase, glucoamylase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, haloperoxidase, invertase, laccase, lipase, mannosidase, oxidase, pectinolytic enzyme, peptidoglutaminase, peroxidase, phytase, polyphenoloxidase, proteolytic enzyme, ribonuclease, transglutaminase, or xylanase. The additional enzyme(s) may be produced, for example, by a microorganism belonging to the genus Aspergillus, preferably Aspergillus aculeatus, Aspergillus awamori, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus foetidus, Aspergillus japonicus, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus niger, or Aspergillus oryzae; Fusarium, preferably Fusarium bactridioides, Fusarium cerealis, Fusarium crookwellense, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium graminum, Fusarium heterosporum, Fusarium negundi, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium reticulatum, Fusarium roseum, Fusarium sambucinum, Fusarium sarcochroum, Fusarium sulphureum, Fusarium toruloseum, Fusarium trichothecioides, or Fusarium venenatum; Humicola, preferably Humicola insolens or Humicola lanuginosa; or Trichoderma, preferably Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma koningii, Trichoderma \n\n Iongibrachiatum, Trichoderma reesei, or Trichoderma viride.\n\n\nThe polypeptide compositions may be prepared in accordance with methods known in the art and may be in the form of a liquid or a dry composition. For instance, the polypeptide composition may be in the form of a granulate or a microgranulate. The polypeptide to be included in the composition may be stabilized in accordance with methods known in the art.\n\n\nExamples are given below of preferred uses of the polypeptide compositions of the invention. The dosage of the polypeptide composition of the invention and other conditions under which the composition is used may be determined on the basis of methods known in the art.\n\n\nUses\n\n\nThe present invention is also directed to methods of using the polypeptides having feruloyl esterase activity, or compositions thereof. The polypeptides of the present invention can be used for degrading or converting plant cell walls or any xylan-containing material, e.g., lignocellulose, originating from plant cells walls (see, for example, WO 2002/18561 ). Examples of various uses are described below. The dosage of the polypeptides of the present invention and other conditions under which the polypeptides are used may be determined on the basis of methods known in the art. The enzymatic degradation of a xylan-containing material is facilitated by full or partial removal of the side branches. The polypeptides of the present invention are preferably used in conjunction with other xylan degrading enzymes such as xylanases, acetylxylan esterases, arabinofuranosidases, xylosidases, feruloyl esterases, glucuronidases, and a combination thereof, in processes wherein xylan-containing material is to be degraded. For example, acetyl groups can be removed by acetylxylan esterases; arabinose groups by alpha- arabinosidases; feruloyl groups by feruloyl esterases, and glucuronic acid groups by alpha- glucuronidases. The oligomers released by the xylanases, or by a combination of xylanases and side branch-hydrolyzing enzymes, can be further degraded to free xylose by beta- xylosidases. The present invention also relates to methods for degrading or converting a cellulosic or xylan-containing material, comprising: treating the cellulosic or xylan-containing material with an enzyme composition in the presence of a polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity of the present invention. In a preferred aspect, the method further comprises recovering the degraded or converted cellulosic or xylan-containing material. The present invention also relates to methods for producing a fermentation product, comprising: (a) saccharifying a cellulosic or xylan-containing material with an enzyme \n\n composition in the presence of a polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity of the present invention; (b) fermenting the saccharified cellulosic or xylan-containing material with one or more (several) fermenting microorganisms to produce the fermentation product; and (c) recovering the fermentation product from the fermentation. The present invention also relates to methods of fermenting a cellulosic or xylan- containing material, comprising: fermenting the cellulosic or xylan-containing material with one or more (several) fermenting microorganisms, wherein the cellulosic or xylan-containing material is saccharified with an enzyme composition in the presence of a polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity of the present invention. In a preferred aspect, the fermenting of the cellulosic or xylan-containing material produces a fermentation product. In another preferred aspect, the method further comprises recovering the fermentation product from the fermentation.\n\n\nThe methods of the present invention can be used to saccharify a cellulosic or xylan- containing material to fermentable sugars and convert the fermentable sugars to many useful substances, e.g., fuel, potable ethanol, and/or fermentation products (e.g., acids, alcohols, ketones, gases, and the like). The production of a desired fermentation product from cellulosic or xylan-containing material typically involves pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis (saccharification), and fermentation.\n\n\nThe processing of cellulosic or xylan-containing material according to the present invention can be accomplished using processes conventional in the art. Moreover, the methods of the present invention can be implemented using any conventional biomass processing apparatus configured to operate in accordance with the invention.\n\n\nHydrolysis (saccharification) and fermentation, separate or simultaneous, include, but are not limited to, separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF); simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF); simultaneous saccharification and cofermentation (SSCF); hybrid hydrolysis and fermentation (HHF); separate hydrolysis and co-fermentation (SHCF); hybrid hydrolysis and fermentation (HHCF); and direct microbial conversion (DMC). SHF uses separate process steps to first enzymatically hydrolyze cellulosic or xylan- containing material to fermentable sugars, e.g., glucose, cellobiose, cellotriose, and pentose sugars, and then ferment the fermentable sugars to ethanol. In SSF, the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic or xylan-containing material and the fermentation of sugars to ethanol are combined in one step (Philippidis, G. P., 1996, Cellulose bioconversion technology, in Handbook on Bioethanol: Production and Utilization, Wyman, C. E., ed., Taylor & Francis, Washington, DC, 179-212). SSCF involves the cofermentation of multiple sugars (Sheehan, J., and Himmel, M., 1999, Enzymes, energy and the environment: A strategic perspective on the U.S. Department of Energy's research and development \n\n activities for bioethanol, Biotechnol. Prog. 15: 817-827). HHF involves a separate hydrolysis step, and in addition a simultaneous saccharification and hydrolysis step, which can be carried out in the same reactor. The steps in an HHF process can be carried out at different temperatures, i.e., high temperature enzymatic saccharification followed by SSF at a lower temperature that the fermentation strain can tolerate. DMC combines all three processes (enzyme production, hydrolysis, and fermentation) in one or more steps where the same organism is used to produce the enzymes for conversion of the cellulosic or xylan-containing material to fermentable sugars and to convert the fermentable sugars into a final product (Lynd, L. R., Weimer, P. J., van ZyI, W. H., and Pretorius, I. S., 2002, Microbial cellulose utilization: Fundamentals and biotechnology, Microbiol. MoI. Biol. Reviews 66: 506-577). It is understood herein that any method known in the art comprising pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis (saccharification), fermentation, or a combination thereof can be used in the practicing the methods of the present invention.\n\n\nA conventional apparatus can include a fed-batch stirred reactor, a batch stirred reactor, a continuous flow stirred reactor with ultrafiltration, and/or a continuous plug-flow column reactor (Fernanda de Castilhos Corazza, Flavio Faria de Moraes, Gisella Maria Zanin and Ivo Neitzel, 2003, Optimal control in fed-batch reactor for the cellobiose hydrolysis, Acta Scientiarum. Technology 25: 33-38; Gusakov, A. V., and Sinitsyn, A. P., 1985, Kinetics of the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose: 1. A mathematical model for a batch reactor process, Enz. Microb. Technol. 7: 346-352), an attrition reactor (Ryu, S. K., and Lee, J. M., 1983, Bioconversion of waste cellulose by using an attrition bioreactor, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 25: 53-65), or a reactor with intensive stirring induced by an electromagnetic field (Gusakov, A. V., Sinitsyn, A. P., Davydkin, I. Y., Davydkin, V. Y., Protas, O. V., 1996, Enhancement of enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis using a novel type of bioreactor with intensive stirring induced by electromagnetic field, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 56: 141-153). Additional reactor types include: fluidized bed, upflow blanket, immobilized, and extruder type reactors for hydrolysis and/or fermentation.\n\n\nPretreatment. In practicing the methods of the present invention, any pretreatment process known in the art can be used to disrupt plant cell wall components of cellulosic and/or xylan-containing material (Chandra et al., 2007, Substrate pretreatment: The key to effective enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosics? Adv. Biochem. Engin./Biotechnol. 108: 67- 93; Galbe and Zacchi, 2007, Pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials for efficient bioethanol production, Adv. Biochem. Engin. / Biotechnol. 108: 41-65; Hendriks and Zeeman, 2009, Pretreatments to enhance the digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass, Bioresource Technol. 100: 10-18; Mosier et al., 2005, Features of promising technologies for pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass, Bioresource Technol. 96: 673-686; Taherzadeh and Karimi, 2008, \n\n Pretreatment of lignocellulosic wastes to improve ethanol and biogas production: A review, Int. J. of MoI. Sci. 9: 1621-1651 ; Yang and Wyman, 2008, Pretreatment: the key to unlocking low-cost cellulosic ethanol, Biofuels Bioproducts and Biorefining-Biofpr. 2: 26-40). Cellulosic or xylan-containing material can also be subjected to particle size reduction, pre-soaking, wetting, washing, or conditioning prior to pretreatment using methods known in the art.\n\n\nConventional pretreatments include, but are not limited to, steam pretreatment (with or without explosion), dilute acid pretreatment, hot water pretreatment, alkaline pretreatment, lime pretreatment, wet oxidation, wet explosion, ammonia fiber explosion, organosolv pretreatment, and biological pretreatment. Additional pretreatments include ammonia percolation, ultrasound, electroporation, microwave, supercritical CO\n2\n, supercritical H\n2\nO, ozone, and gamma irradiation pretreatments.\n\n\nCellulosic or xylan-containing material can be pretreated before hydrolysis and/or fermentation. Pretreatment is preferably performed prior to the hydrolysis. Alternatively, the pretreatment can be carried out simultaneously with enzyme hydrolysis to release fermentable sugars, such as glucose, xylose, and/or cellobiose. In most cases the pretreatment step itself results in some conversion of biomass to fermentable sugars (even in absence of enzymes).\n\n\nSteam Pretreatment. In steam pretreatment, cellulosic or xylan-containing material is heated to disrupt the plant cell wall components, including lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose to make the cellulose and other fractions, e.g., hemicellulose, accessible to enzymes. Cellulosic or xylan-containing material is passed to or through a reaction vessel where steam is injected to increase the temperature to the required temperature and pressure and is retained therein for the desired reaction time. Steam pretreatment is preferably done at 140-230\n0\nC, more preferably 160-200\n0\nC, and most preferably 170-190°C, where the optimal temperature range depends on any addition of a chemical catalyst. Residence time for the steam pretreatment is preferably 1-15 minutes, more preferably 3-12 minutes, and most preferably 4-10 minutes, where the optimal residence time depends on temperature range and any addition of a chemical catalyst. Steam pretreatment allows for relatively high solids loadings, so that cellulosic or xylan-containing material is generally only moist during the pretreatment. The steam pretreatment is often combined with an explosive discharge of the material after the pretreatment, which is known as steam explosion, that is, rapid flashing to atmospheric pressure and turbulent flow of the material to increase the accessible surface area by fragmentation (Duff and Murray, 1996, Bioresource Technology 855: 1-33; Galbe and Zacchi, 2002, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 59: 618-628; U.S. Patent Application No. 20020164730). During steam pretreatment, hemicellulose acetyl groups are cleaved and the resulting acid autocatalyzes partial hydrolysis of the hemicellulose to \n\n monosaccharides and oligosaccharides. Lignin is removed to only a limited extent.\n\n\nA catalyst such as H\n2\nSO\n4\n or SO\n2\n (typically 0.3 to 3% w/w) is often added prior to steam pretreatment, which decreases the time and temperature, increases the recovery, and improves enzymatic hydrolysis (Ballesteros et al., 2006, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 129-132: 496-508; Varga et al., 2004, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 113-116: 509-523;\n\n\nSassner et al., 2006, Enzyme Microb. Technol. 39: 756-762).\n\n\nChemical Pretreatment: The term \"chemical treatment\" refers to any chemical pretreatment that promotes the separation and/or release of cellulose, hemicellulose, and/or lignin. Examples of suitable chemical pretreatment processes include, for example, dilute acid pretreatment, lime pretreatment, wet oxidation, ammonia fiber/freeze explosion (AFEX), ammonia percolation (APR), and organosolv pretreatments.\n\n\nIn dilute acid pretreatment, cellulosic or xylan-containing material is mixed with dilute acid, typically H\n2\nSO\n4\n, and water to form a slurry, heated by steam to the desired temperature, and after a residence time flashed to atmospheric pressure. The dilute acid pretreatment can be performed with a number of reactor designs, e.g., plug-flow reactors, counter-current reactors, or continuous counter-current shrinking bed reactors (Duff and Murray, 1996, supra; Schell et al., 2004, Bioresource Technol. 91 : 179-188; Lee et al., 1999, Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 65: 93-115).\n\n\nSeveral methods of pretreatment under alkaline conditions can also be used. These alkaline pretreatments include, but are not limited to, lime pretreatment, wet oxidation, ammonia percolation (APR), and ammonia fiber/freeze explosion (AFEX).\n\n\nLime pretreatment is performed with calcium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, or ammonia at low temperatures of 85-15O\n0\nC and residence times from 1 hour to several days (Wyman et al., 2005, Bioresource Technol. 96: 1959-1966; Mosier et al., 2005, Bioresource Technol. 96: 673-686). WO 2006/110891 , WO 2006/11899, WO 2006/11900, and WO 2006/110901 disclose pretreatment methods using ammonia.\n\n\nWet oxidation is a thermal pretreatment performed typically at 180-200°C for 5-15 minutes with addition of an oxidative agent such as hydrogen peroxide or over-pressure of oxygen (Schmidt and Thomsen, 1998, Bioresource Technol. 64: 139-151 ; Palonen et al., 2004, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 117: 1-17; Varga et al., 2004, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 88: 567- 574; Martin et al., 2006, J. Chem. Technol. Biotechnol. 81 : 1669-1677). The pretreatment is performed at preferably 1-40% dry matter, more preferably 2-30% dry matter, and most preferably 5-20% dry matter, and often the initial pH is increased by the addition of alkali such as sodium carbonate. A modification of the wet oxidation pretreatment method, known as wet explosion\n\n\n(combination of wet oxidation and steam explosion), can handle dry matter up to 30%. In wet \n\n explosion, the oxidizing agent is introduced during pretreatment after a certain residence time. The pretreatment is then ended by flashing to atmospheric pressure (WO 2006/032282).\n\n\nAmmonia fiber explosion (AFEX) involves treating cellulosic or xylan-containing material with liquid or gaseous ammonia at moderate temperatures such as 90-100°C and high pressure such as 17-20 bar for 5-10 minutes, where the dry matter content can be as high as 60% (Gollapalli et al., 2002, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 98: 23-35; Chundawat et al., 2007, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 96: 219-231 ; Alizadeh et al., 2005, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 121 : 1133-1141 ; Teymouri et al., 2005, Bioresource Technol. 96: 2014-2018). AFEX pretreatment results in the depolymerization of cellulose and partial hydrolysis of hemicellulose. Lignin- carbohydrate complexes are cleaved.\n\n\nOrganosolv pretreatment delignifies cellulosic or xylan-containing material by extraction using aqueous ethanol (40-60% ethanol) at 160-200°C for 30-60 minutes (Pan et al., 2005, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 90: 473-481 ; Pan et al., 2006, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 94: 851-861 ; Kurabi et al., 2005, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 121 : 219-230). Sulphuric acid is usually added as a catalyst. In organosolv pretreatment, the majority of hemicellulose is removed.\n\n\nOther examples of suitable pretreatment methods are described by Schell et al., 2003, Appl. Biochem. and Biotechnol. Vol. 105-108, p. 69-85, and Mosier et al., 2005, Bioresource Technology 96: 673-686, and U.S. Published Application 2002/0164730.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the chemical pretreatment is preferably carried out as an acid treatment, and more preferably as a continuous dilute and/or mild acid treatment. The acid is typically sulfuric acid, but other acids can also be used, such as acetic acid, citric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, hydrogen chloride, or mixtures thereof. Mild acid treatment is conducted in the pH range of preferably 1-5, more preferably 1-4, and most preferably 1-3. In one aspect, the acid concentration is in the range from preferably 0.01 to 20 wt % acid, more preferably 0.05 to 10 wt % acid, even more preferably 0.1 to 5 wt % acid, and most preferably 0.2 to 2.0 wt % acid. The acid is contacted with cellulosic or xylan-containing material and held at a temperature in the range of preferably 160-220°C, and more preferably 165-195\n0\nC, for periods ranging from seconds to minutes to, e.g., 1 second to 60 minutes.\n\n\nIn another aspect, pretreatment is carried out as an ammonia fiber explosion step (AFEX pretreatment step).\n\n\nIn another aspect, pretreatment takes place in an aqueous slurry. In preferred aspects, cellulosic or xylan-containing material is present during pretreatment in amounts preferably between 10-80 wt%, more preferably between 20-70 wt%, and most preferably between 30-60 wt%, such as around 50 wt%. The pretreated cellulosic or xylan-containing material can be unwashed or washed using any method known in the art, e.g., washed with water. \n\n Mechanical Pretreatment: The term \"mechanical pretreatment\" refers to various types of grinding or milling (e.g., dry milling, wet milling, or vibratory ball milling).\n\n\nPhysical Pretreatment: The term \"physical pretreatment\" refers to any pretreatment that promotes the separation and/or release of cellulose, hemicellulose, and/or lignin from cellulosic or xylan-containing material. For example, physical pretreatment can involve irradiation (e.g., microwave irradiation), steaming/steam explosion, hydrothermolysis, and combinations thereof.\n\n\nPhysical pretreatment can involve high pressure and/or high temperature (steam explosion). In one aspect, high pressure means pressure in the range of preferably about 300 to about 600 psi, more preferably about 350 to about 550 psi, and most preferably about 400 to about 500 psi, such as around 450 psi. In another aspect, high temperature means temperatures in the range of about 100 to about 300°C, preferably about 140 to about 235\n0\nC. In a preferred aspect, mechanical pretreatment is performed in a batch-process, steam gun hydrolyzer system that uses high pressure and high temperature as defined above, e.g., a Sunds Hydrolyzer available from Sunds Defibrator AB, Sweden.\n\n\nCombined Physical and Chemical Pretreatment: Cellulosic or xylan-containing material can be pretreated both physically and chemically. For instance, the pretreatment step can involve dilute or mild acid treatment and high temperature and/or pressure treatment. The physical and chemical pretreatments can be carried out sequentially or simultaneously, as desired. A mechanical pretreatment can also be included.\n\n\nAccordingly, in a preferred aspect, cellulosic or xylan-containing material is subjected to mechanical, chemical, or physical pretreatment, or any combination thereof, to promote the separation and/or release of cellulose, hemicellulose, and/or lignin.\n\n\nBiological Pretreatment: The term \"biological pretreatment\" refers to any biological pretreatment that promotes the separation and/or release of cellulose, hemicellulose, and/or lignin from cellulosic or xylan-containing material. Biological pretreatment techniques can involve applying lignin-solubilizing microorganisms (see, for example, Hsu, T. -A., 1996, Pretreatment of biomass, in Handbook on Bioethanol: Production and Utilization, Wyman, C. E., ed., Taylor & Francis, Washington, DC, 179-212; Ghosh and Singh, 1993, Physicochemical and biological treatments for enzymatic/microbial conversion of cellulosic biomass, Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 39: 295-333; McMillan, J. D., 1994, Pretreating lignocellulosic biomass: a review, in Enzymatic Conversion of Biomass for Fuels Production, Himmel, M. E., Baker, J. O., and Overend, R. P., eds., ACS Symposium Series 566, American Chemical Society, Washington, DC, chapter 15; Gong, C. S., Cao, N. J., Du, J., and Tsao, G. T., 1999, Ethanol production from renewable resources, in Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology, Scheper, T., ed., Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, Germany, \n\n 65: 207-241 ; Olsson and Hahn-Hagerdal, 1996, Fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates for ethanol production, Enz. Microb. Tech. 18: 312-331 ; and Vallander and Eriksson, 1990, Production of ethanol from lignocellulosic materials: State of the art, Adv. Biochem. Eng./Biotechnol. 42: 63-95). Saccharification. In the hydrolysis step, also known as saccharification, the pretreated cellulosic or xylan-containing material is hydrolyzed to break down cellulose and hemicellulose to fermentable sugars, such as glucose, cellobiose, xylose, xylulose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, and/or soluble oligosaccharides. The hydrolysis is performed enzymatically by an enzyme composition in the presence of a polypeptide having feruloyl esterase activity of the present invention. The components of the enzyme composition can also be added sequentially.\n\n\nEnzymatic hydrolysis is preferably carried out in a suitable aqueous environment under conditions that can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. In a preferred aspect, hydrolysis is performed under conditions suitable for the activity of the enzyme(s), i.e., optimal for the enzyme(s). The hydrolysis can be carried out as a fed batch or continuous process where the pretreated cellulosic or xylan-containing material (substrate) is fed gradually to, for example, an enzyme containing hydrolysis solution.\n\n\nThe saccharification is generally performed in stirred-tank reactors or fermentors under controlled pH, temperature, and mixing conditions. Suitable process time, temperature and pH conditions can readily be determined by one skilled in the art. For example, the saccharification can last up to 200 hours, but is typically performed for preferably about 12 to about 96 hours, more preferably about 16 to about 72 hours, and most preferably about 24 to about 48 hours. The temperature is in the range of preferably about 25°C to about 70\n0\nC, more preferably about 30\n0\nC to about 65°C, and more preferably about 40\n0\nC to 60°C, in particular about 50°C. The pH is in the range of preferably about 3 to about 8, more preferably about 3.5 to about 7, and most preferably about 4 to about 6, in particular about pH 5. The dry solids content is in the range of preferably about 5 to about 50 wt %, more preferably about 10 to about 40 wt %, and most preferably about 20 to about 30 wt %.\n\n\nThe enzyme composition preferably comprises enzymes having cellulolytic activity and/or xylan degrading activity. In one aspect, the enzyme composition comprises one or more (several) xylan degrading enzymes. In another aspect, the enzyme composition comprises one or more (several) cellulolytic enzymes. In another aspect, the enzyme composition comprises one or more (several) xylan degrading enzymes and one or more (several) cellulolytic enzymes. The one or more (several) xylan degrading enzymes are preferably selected from the group consisting of a xylanase, an acetyxylan esterase, a feruloyl esterase, an \n\n arabinofuranosidase, a xylosidase, and a glucuronidase. The one or more (several) cellulolytic enzymes are preferably selected from the group consisting of an endoglucanase, a cellobiohydrolase, and a beta-glucosidase.\n\n\nIn another preferred aspect, the enzyme composition further or even further comprises a polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity (see, for example, WO 2005/074647, WO 2005/074656, and WO 2007/089290). In another aspect, the enzyme composition may further or even further comprise one or more (several) additional enzyme activities to improve the degradation of the cellulose-containing material. Preferred additional enzymes are hemicellulases (e.g., alpha-D-glucuronidases, alpha-L- arabinofuranosidases, endo-mannanases, beta-mannosidases, alpha-galactosidases, endo- alpha-L-arabinanases, beta-galactosidases), carbohydrate-esterases (e.g., acetylxylan esterases, acetyl-mannan esterases, ferulic acid esterases, coumaric acid esterases, glucuronoyl esterases), pectinases, proteases, ligninolytic enzymes (e.g., laccases, manganese peroxidases, lignin peroxidases, H\n2\nO\n2\n-producing enzymes, oxidoreductases), expansins, swollenins, or mixtures thereof. In the methods of the present invention, the additional enzyme(s) can be added prior to or during fermentation, e.g., during saccharification or during or after propagation of the fermenting microorganism(s).\n\n\nOne or more (several) components of the enzyme composition may be wild-type proteins, recombinant proteins, or a combination of wild-type proteins and recombinant proteins. For example, one or more (several) components may be native proteins of a cell, which is used as a host cell to express recombinantly one or more (several) other components of the enzyme composition. One or more (several) components of the enzyme composition may be produced as monocomponents, which are then combined to form the enzyme composition. The enzyme composition may be a combination of multicomponent and monocomponent protein preparations.\n\n\nThe enzymes used in the methods of the present invention may be in any form suitable for use in the processes described herein, such as, for example, a crude fermentation broth with or without cells removed, a semi-purified or purified enzyme preparations, or a host cell as a source of the enzymes. The enzyme composition may be a dry powder or granulate, a non-dusting granulate, a liquid, a stabilized liquid, or a stabilized protected enzyme. Liquid enzyme preparations may, for instance, be stabilized by adding stabilizers such as a sugar, a sugar alcohol or another polyol, and/or lactic acid or another organic acid according to established processes.\n\n\nThe optimum amounts of the enzymes and polypeptides having feruloyl esterase activity depend on several factors including, but not limited to, the mixture of component cellulolytic enzymes, the cellulosic or xylan-containing material, the concentration of the \n\n cellulosic or xylan-containing material, the pretreatment(s) of the cellulosic or xylan- containing material, temperature, time, pH, and inclusion of fermenting organism (e.g., yeast for Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation).\n\n\nIn a preferred aspect, an effective amount of cellulolytic enzyme(s) and/or xylan- degrading enzyme(s) to cellulosic or xylan-containing material is about 0.5 to about 50 mg, preferably at about 0.5 to about 40 mg, more preferably at about 0.5 to about 25 mg, more preferably at about 0.75 to about 20 mg, more preferably at about 0.75 to about 15 mg, even more preferably at about 0.5 to about 10 mg, and most preferably at about 2.5 to about 10 mg per g of cellulosic or xylan-containing material.

The enzymes can be derived or obtained from any suitable origin, including, bacterial, fungal, yeast, plant, or mammalian origin. The term \"obtained\" means herein that the enzyme may have been isolated from an organism that naturally produces the enzyme as a native enzyme. The term \"obtained\" also means herein that the enzyme may have been produced recombinantly in a host organism employing methods described herein, wherein the recombinantly produced enzyme is either native or foreign to the host organism or has a modified amino acid sequence, e.g., having one or more (several) amino acids that are deleted, inserted and/or substituted, i.e., a recombinantly produced enzyme that is a mutant and/or a fragment of a native amino acid sequence or an enzyme produced by nucleic acid shuffling processes known in the art. Encompassed within the meaning of a native enzyme are natural variants and within the meaning of a foreign enzyme are variants obtained recombinantly, such as by site-directed mutagenesis or shuffling. \n\n A polypeptide having cellulolytic enzyme activity or xylan degrading activity may be a bacterial polypeptide.

The fermentation product(s) can be optionally recovered from the fermentation medium using any method known in the art including, but not limited to, chromatography, electrophoretic procedures, differential solubility, distillation, or extraction. \n\n For example, alcohol is separated from the fermented cellulosic or xylan-containing material and purified by conventional methods of distillation. Ethanol with a purity of up to about 96 vol.% can be obtained, which can be used as, for example, fuel ethanol, drinking ethanol, i.e., potable neutral spirits, or industrial ethanol.\n\n\nOther Uses\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the present invention may also be used with limited activity of other xylanolytic enzymes to degrade xylans for production of oligosaccharides. The oligosaccharides may be used as bulking agents, like arabinoxylan oligosaccharides released from cereal cell wall material, or more or less purified arabinoxylans from cereals.\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the present invention may also be used in combination with other xylanolytic enzymes to degrade xylans to xylose and other monosaccharides (U.S. Patent No. 5,658,765). The released xylose may be converted to other compounds.\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the present invention may be used together with other enzymes like glucanases to improve the extraction of oil from oil-rich plant material, like corn-oil from corn-embryos.\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the present invention may also be used in baking to improve the development, elasticity, and/or stability of dough and/or the volume, crumb structure, and/or anti-staling properties of the baked product (see U.S. Patent No. 5,693,518). The polypeptides may also be used for the preparation of dough or baked products prepared from any type of flour or meal (e.g., based on wheat, rye, barley, oat, or maize). The baked products produced with a polypeptide of the present invention include bread, rolls, baquettes and the like. For baking purposes a polypeptide of the present invention may be used as the only or major enzymatic activity, or may be used in combination with other enzymes such as a xylanase, a lipase, an amylase, an oxidase (e.g., glucose oxidase, peroxidase), a laccase and/or a protease.\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the present invention may also be used for modification of animal feed and may exert their effect either in vitro (by modifying components of the feed) or in vivo to improve feed digestibility and increase the efficiency of its utilization (U.S. Patent No. 6,245,546). The polypeptides may be added to animal feed compositions containing high amounts of arabinoxylans and glucuronoxylans, e.g., feed containing cereals such as barley, wheat, rye, oats, or maize. When added to feed the polypeptide will improve the in vivo breakdown of plant cell wall material partly due to a reduction of intestinal viscosity (Bedford et al., 1993, Proceedings of the 1st Symposium on Enzymes in Animal Nutrition, pp. 73-77), whereby improved utilization of the plant nutrients by the animal is achieved. Thereby, the growth rate and/or feed conversion ratio (i.e., the weight of ingested feed relative to weight gain) of the \n\n animal is improved.\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the present invention may also be used in the paper and pulp industry, inter alia, in bleaching processes to enhance the brightness of bleached pulps whereby the amount of chlorine used in the bleaching stages is reduced, and to increase the freeness of pulps in the recycled paper process (Eriksson, 1990, Wood Science and Technology 24: 79-101 ; Paice et al., 1988, Biotechnol. and Bioeng. 32: 235-239, and Pommier et al., 1989, Tappi Journal 187-191 ). The treatment of lignocellulosic pulp may be performed, for example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,658,765, WO 93/08275, WO 91/02839, and WO 92/03608. The polypeptides of the present invention may also be used in beer brewing, in particular to improve the filterability of wort containing, for example, barley and/or sorghum malt (WO 2002/24926). The polypeptides may be used in the same manner as pentosanases conventionally used for brewing, e.g., as described by Vietor et al., 1993, J. Inst. Brew. 99: 243-248; and EP 227159. Furthermore, the polypeptides may be used for treatment of brewers spent grain, i.e., residuals from beer wort production containing barley or malted barley or other cereals, so as to improve the utilization of the residuals for, e.g., animal feed.\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the present invention may be used for separation of components of plant cell materials, in particular of cereal components such as wheat components. Of particular interest is the separation of wheat into gluten and starch, i.e., components of considerable commercial interest. The separation process may be performed by use of methods known in the art, such as the so-called batter process (or wet milling process) performed as a hydroclone or a decanter process. In the batter process, the starting material is a dilute pumpable dispersion of the plant material such as wheat to be subjected to separation. In a wheat separation process the dispersion is made normally from wheat flour and water.\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the invention may also be used in the preparation of fruit or vegetable juice in order to increase yield (see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,228,630).\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the present invention may also be used as a component of an enzymatic scouring system for textiles (see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,258,590).

The present invention also relates to methods of producing a protein, comprising: (a) cultivating a recombinant host cell comprising a gene encoding a protein operably linked to the such polynucleotides encoding a signal peptide, a propeptide, or a signal peptide and a propeptide, wherein the gene is foreign to the polynucleotide under conditions conducive for production of the protein; and (b) recovering the protein; and (b) recovering the protein. The protein may be native or heterologous to a host cell. The term \"protein\" is not meant herein to refer to a specific length of the encoded product and, therefore, encompasses peptides, oligopeptides, and proteins. The term \"protein\" also encompasses two or more polypeptides combined to form the encoded product. The proteins also include hybrid polypeptides that comprise a combination of partial or complete polypeptide sequences obtained from at least two different proteins wherein one or more (several) may be heterologous or native to the host cell. Proteins further include naturally occurring allelic and engineered variations of the above mentioned proteins and hybrid proteins.\n\n\nPreferably, the protein is a hormone or variant thereof, enzyme, receptor or portion thereof, antibody or portion thereof, or reporter.

The enzyme preparation is diluted to provide less than 15% conversion of p-nitrophenylferulate by making an initial dilution in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube with 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 followed by 2-fold serial dilutions with 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0. Then 100 μl aliquots of the diluted enzyme are transferred to wells of a 96-well plate.\n\n\nA p-nitrophenylferulate stock solution is made by dissolving p-nitrophenylacetate in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to constitute a 0.1 M solution. Before assay, a sample of the stock solution is diluted 100-fold in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 to make a 1 mM solution. A 100 μl volume of 1 mM p-nitrophenylferulate is mixed with each dilution of the enzyme and then incubated at 25\n0\nC for 10 minutes. Substrate alone, enzyme alone, and buffer alone are run as controls. p-Nitrophenol standard solutions of 0.25, 0.2, 0.1 , 0.05, and 0.02 mM are prepared by diluting a 10 mM stock solution in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0. At 10 minutes, 50 μl of 1.0 M Tris-HCI pH 8.0 buffer is added to each well (including samples, substrate control, enzyme control, reagent control, and standards), mixed, and the absorbance at 405 nm immediately measured on a SPECTRAMAX™ 340 PC plate reader \n\n (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). One unit of feruloyl esterase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme capable of releasing 1 μmole of p-nitrophenolate anion per minute at pH 5, 25°C.\n\n\nExample 1 : Identification of a feruloyl esterase gene in the genomic sequence of Thielavia terrestris\n\n\nA low redundancy draft sequence of the Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 genome was generated by the Joint Genome Center (JGI), Walnut Creek, CA, USA, using the whole genome shotgun method according to Martinez et al., 2008, Nature Biotechnol. 26: 553-560. Shotgun sequencing reads (approximately 18307) were assembled into contigs using the Phrap assembler (Ewing and Green, 1998, Genome Res. 8: 186-194). A tblastn search (Altschul et al., 1997, Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3389-3402) of the assembled contigs was carried out using as query a feruloyl esterase protein sequence from Humicola insolens (SEQ ID NO: 3). A translated amino acid sequence of 86 amino acids with greater than 76% identity to the query sequence was identified. The partial sequence was searched against public databases using blastp with BLOSUM62 as matrix and gap penalties set to 11 (Altschul et al., 1997, Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3389-3402) and was found to be 76% identical to a tannase from Aspergillus oryzae (UniProt accession number P78581 ).\n\n\nExample 2: Identification of a full-length feruloyl esterase gene in the genomic sequence of Thielavia terrestris\n\n\nA low redundancy (approximately 4.5X coverage) draft sequence of the Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 genome was generated by JGI, using the whole genome shotgun method described by Martinez et al., 2008, supra. Shotgun sequencing reads (approximately 266822) were assembled into contigs using the JAZZ assembler (Shapiro, H. 2005. Outline of the assembly process: Jazz, the JGI in-house assembler\" LBNL Paper LBNL-58236. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA), and gene models were derived from the assembled contigs using the PedantPro software suite (Biomax Informatics AG, Lochhamer Str. 9, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany). The full-length amino acid sequence from Aspergillus oryzae tannase (UniProt accession number P78581 ) was used to search against the Thielavia terrestris gene models using tblastn with BLOSUM62 as the matrix and gap penalties set to 11 (Altschul et al., 1997, supra). The results of the tblastn search identified a 558 bp section of the gene models having 72% identity to the Aspergillus oryzae tannase sequence.\n\n\nExample 3: Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 genomic DNA extraction \n\n Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 was grown on PDA plates at 45\n0\nC to confluence. Three 4 mm\n2\n squares were cut from the PDA plates, inoculated into 25 ml of YP medium containing 2% glucose in a baffled 125 ml shake flask, and incubated at 41\n0\nC for 2 days with shaking at 200 rpm. Mycelia were harvested by filtration using MIRACLOTH® (Calbiochem, La JoIIa, CA, USA), washed twice in deionized water, and frozen under liquid nitrogen. Frozen mycelia were ground, by mortar and pestle, to a fine powder, and total DNA was isolated using a DNEASY® Plant Maxi Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA).\n\n\nExample 4: Cloning of the Thielavia terrestris feruloyl esterase gene and construction of an Aspergillus niger expression vector\n\n\nTwo synthetic oligonucleotide primers (shown below) were designed based on the gene model described in Example 2. These primers were used to PCR amplify the Thielavia terrestris feruloyl esterase gene from the genomic DNA prepared in Example 3. An IN-FUSION™ Cloning Kit (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector pBM120a (WO 2006/078256). TtFaeCNcoTagV2F:\n\n\n5'-ACACAACTGGCCATGGCCGCCTTCGCCAAGCT-S' (SEQ ID NO: 4) PacTagTtFaeCsca7R: 5'-CAGTCACCTCTAGTTATTAGTACACAGGCACCTTAA-S' (SEQ ID NO: 5) Bold letters represent coding sequence. The remaining sequence is homologous to the insertion sites of pBM120a.\n\n\nFifty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in an amplification reaction composed of 95.4 ng of Thielavia terrestris genomic DNA, 1X EXPAND™ High Fidelity PCR buffer (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) with MgCI\n2\n, 0.25 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, and 2.6 units of EXPAND™ Enzyme Mix (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) in a final volume of 50 μl. The amplification was performed using an EPPENDORF® MASTERCYCLER® 5333 (Eppendorf Scientific, Inc., Westbury, NY, USA) programmed for 1 cycle at 94°C for 2 minute; 30 cycles each at 94°C for 15 seconds, 61.4°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute; and a final elongation at 72\n0\nC for 7 minutes. The heat block then went to a 4°C soak cycle.\n\n\nThe reaction products were isolated by 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis in TBE buffer (10.8 g of Tris base, 5.5 g of boric acid and 4 ml of 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0 per liter). A PCR product band of approximately 1.8 kb was excised from the gel and purified using a QIAQUICK® Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nPlasmid pBM120a was digested with Nco I and Pac I, isolated by 1.0% agarose gel \n\n electrophoresis in TBE buffer, and purified using a QIAQUICK® Gel Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nThe gene fragment and the digested vector were ligated together using an INFUSION™ Cloning Kit resulting in pDFng106 (Figure 2) in which transcription of the feruloyl esterase gene was under the control of a hybrid of promoters from the genes for Aspergillus niger neutral alpha-amylase and Aspergillus nidulans triose phosphate isomerase (NA2-tpi promoter). The ligation reaction (20 μl) was composed of 1X I N-FUSION ™ Buffer (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), \"IX BSA (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), 1 μl of IN-FUSION™ enzyme (diluted 1 :10) (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), 132 ng of pBM120a digested with Nco I and Pac I, and 100 ng of the purified Thielavia terrestris PCR product. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Two μl of the reaction were used to transform E. coli XL10 SOLOPACK® Gold Supercompetent cells (Stratagene, La JoIIa, CA, USA) according to the maufacturer's instructions. An E. coli transformant containing pDFng106 was obtained and plasmid DNA was prepared using a BIOROBOT® 9600 (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The Thielavia terrestris feruloyl esterase gene insert in pDFng106 was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A clone containing pDFng106 was picked into eight 14 ml polypropylene round-bottom tubes each containing 3 ml of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg of ampicillin per ml and grown overnight in at 37\n0\nC and with shaking at 200 rpm. Plasmid pDFng106 was isolated using a QIAGEN® Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions in preparation for transforming Aspergillus niger MBin120 protoplasts.\n\n\nThe same 1.8 kb PCR fragment was cloned into pCR®2.1-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using a TOPO® TA CLONING® Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), to generate pDFng105 (Figure 3). The Thielavia terrestris feruloyl esterase gene insert in pDFng105 was confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli pDFng105 was deposited with the Agricultural Research Service Patent Culture Collection, Northern Regional Research Center, Peoria, IL, USA, on November 26, 2008 as NRRL B-50204.\n\n\nExample 5: Characterization of the Thielavia terrestris genomic sequence encoding a feruloyl esterase\n\n\nDNA sequencing of the 1.8 kb PCR fragment was performed with a Perkin-Elmer\n\n\nApplied Biosystems Model 377 XL Automated DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer/Applied\n\n\nBiosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) using dye-terminator chemistry (Giesecke et al.,\n\n\n1992, Journal of Virology Methods 38: 47-60). The following primers were used for sequencing: pDFng105 sequencing primers: \n\n M13 (-20) F: δ'-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-S' (SEQ ID NO: 6) M13 (-48) R: δ'-AGCGGATAACAATTTGACACAGGA-S' (SEQ ID NO: 7) pDFng106 sequencing primers: Na2Tpi F: δ'-ACTCAATTTACCTCTATCCACACTT-S' (SEQ ID NO: 8) TtFaeCseqF: δ'-AAGTCCTCACCAAGGGTTTC-S' (SEQ ID NO: 9) AMG R: δ'-CTATAGCGAAATGGATTGATTGTCT-S' (SEQ ID NO: 10)\n\n\nNucleotide sequence data were scrutinized for quality and all sequences were compared to each other with assistance of PHRED/PHRAP software (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA). A gene model for the Thielavia terrestris feruloyl esterase sequence on scaffold 7 was constructed based on similarity of the encoded protein to known homologs of feruloyl esterases. The nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1 ) and deduced amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 2) are shown in Figure 1. The genomic fragment of 1824 bp (including the stop codon) encodes a polypeptide of 585 amino acids, interrupted by 1 predicted intron of 66 bp. The % G+C content of the gene and the mature coding sequence are 60.3% and 60.4%, respectively. Using the SignalP software program (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1-6), a signal peptide of 25 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 560 amino acids with a molecular mass of 59.9 kDa.\n\n\nA comparative pairwise global alignment of amino acid sequences was determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. MoI. Biol. 48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle program of EMBOSS with gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EBLOSUM62 matrix. The alignment showed that the deduced amino acid sequence of the Thielavia terrestris gene encoding the mature polypeptide having feruloyl esterase shared 75% identity (excluding gaps) to the deduced amino acid sequence of a tannase and feruloyl esterase family protein from Neosartorya fischeri (UniProt Accession number A1 D9T4). \n\n Deposit of Biological Material\n\n\nThe following biological material has been deposited under the terms of the Budapest Treaty with the Agricultural Research Service Patent Culture Collection (NRRL), Northern Regional Research Center, 1815 University Street, Peoria, IL, USA, and given the following accession number:\n\n\nDeposit Accession Number Date of Deposit\n\n\nE. coli pDFng 105 NRRL B-50204 November 26, 2008\n\n\nThe strain has been deposited under conditions that assure that access to the culture will be available during the pendency of this patent application to one determined by foreign patent laws to be entitled thereto.

Description\n\n\n\n\n PRODUCTION OF FC-FUSION POLYPEPTIDES IN EUKARYOTIC ALGAE\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE\n\n\nThis application claims priority to and benefit of U S Provisional Application No 60/987,734, entitled PRODUCTION OF FC-FUSION POLYPEPTIDES IN EUKARYOTIC ALGAE, filed November 13, 2007, which application is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0001] The present invention relates generally to methods and compositions for expressing and purifying polypeptides manufactured in plastid (chloroplast) organelles, and more specifically to Fc-fusion constructs that encode therapeutic products that are expressed in chloroplasts\n\n\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION [0002] As the clinical success of recombinant protein-based therapies continues to grow, pharmaceutical companies are faced with several dilemmas, stemming primarily from increasing capital and production costs that threaten to limit the availability of these agents, as well as the molecules' increasing complexity The inherently high cost of goods (COGs) for these molecules further exacerbates the fact that many of these proteins and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used to treat chrome diseases that require multiple grams per patient, per year\n\n\nEfficient expression and accumulation of biologically active eukaryotic proteins in their native, functional conformations is difficult to achieve at reasonable cost in cell-based biomanufactuπng systems In general, such platforms are either optimized for soluble protein secretion from highly capital-intensive mammalian cell cultures, or bacterial expression utilizing puπfied inclusion bodies that require inefficient downstream denaturation and refolding The availability of less costly and more flexible manufacturing platforms for soluble, complex proteins is thus a significant unmet need Patients, insurers, for-proflt health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and the federal government, are also becoming increasingly reticent to pay for therapies that in some cases may exceed $50,000 per year [0003] Currently, there are a number of heterologous protein expression systems available for the production of therapeutic proteins for use both in human and animal healthcare Each of these systems has distinct attributes in terms of protein yield, ease of manipulation, and cost of \n\n production. mAbs and complex therapeutic proteins are produced primarily by culture of transgenic mammalian cells in fixed bioreactor facilities consisting of scale up trains with stainless-steel vessels of increasing capacity, complex systems for media delivery and liquid handling, validatable clean-in-place systems, and equipment for upstream unit operations to deliver clarified extracts for further downstream processing. Due to high capital and media costs, and the inherent complexity of mammalian production systems, mAbs produced in this manner are very expensive, ranging from $ 150 to $ 1 ,000 per gram, prior to purification. Yeast and bacterial systems, while more economical in terms of media components, have several shortcomings in terms of protein expression, including an inability to efficiently produce properly folded functional molecules, as well as poor soluble yields of more complex proteins. [0004] Some of the proteins that are difficult to produce in microbial systems include those incorporating fragment-crystallizable (Fc) domains derived from mammalian immunoglobulins. Fc domains are very useful, both with regard to incorporation into chimeric therapeutic proteins that have improved pharmacokinetic properties and long circulating half-lives, as well as their ability to facilitate protein purification using Protein A or Protein G affinity matrices. These latter reagents are well-known in the art as components of efficient capture resins that are useful for isolation of Fc-containing molecules from complex mixtures. As Fc domains are poorly suited for expression in bacterial systems it is desirable to evaluate their usefulness for enhancing purification efficiency in eukaryotic platforms capable of soluble expression of Fc-containing complex molecules. These Fc domains can also be removed from the final product if desired by incorporation of an enzyme-cleavable linker in the chimeric protein. For some protein products, incorporation of an Fc domain into the product can confer a therapeutic benefit. [0005] Perhaps no other mAb-based therapy better illustrates the cost and scale dilemma than Omalizumab also known as Xolair. Xolair is a recently approved anti-IgE mAb therapy for allergic asthma. Xolair binds to the Fc portion of circulating IgE that normally interacts with FcεRIα, the high affinity receptor for IgE on the surface of mast cells and basophils. By preventing FcεRIα/IgE interaction, Xolair limits the production of inflammatory mediators produced by these cells (i.e. histamine, leukotrienes, protaglandins, and the like). [0006] The cost of Xolair treatment varies from between $5,000-$ 12,000 per patient per year, depending upon patient weight and circulating levels of IgE at the time of treatment initiation. In North America alone, there are approximately fifteen million asthma sufferers, of whom, approximately 60%, or nine million, suffer from allergic asthma. Thus, to treat even 10% of the affected individuals in North America would cost between $4.5 and $10.8 billion dollars annually depending upon dosage requirements, while the amount of mAb required would be 1.8 \n\n to 9 metric tons. For comparison, in 2002, total mAb-based therapy production was only 916 kg while sales were around $ 5.2 billion. Clearly, a production platform that can substantially reduce both COGs and capitalization costs, and at the same time hold out the promise of treating substantially more afflicted individuals would be of tremendous benefit to the healthcare system in general.\n\n\n[0007] Like Xolair and other anti-IgE mAbs, the naturally occurring receptor FcεRIα, binds IgE with high affinity. The human FcεRIα is a tetrameric complex located on the surface of mast cells and basophils, eosinophils, platelets and megakaryocytes. In these cell types, the receptor is comprised of an α chain, containing the ligand binding site, a β chain and a dimer of inter- molecularly, disulphide linked, γ chains, linked by inter-molecular disulphide bonds which are critically important for receptor accumulation, β chains are absent from this complex on the surface of both Langerhans cells and activated monocytes. The cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain of FcεRIα are not required for ligand binding and the extracellular domain of FcεRIα (ecFcεRIα) does not require glycosylation for ligand binding. [0008] Recent success in the expression of recombinant proteins from both the nuclear and chloroplast genomes in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii serves to highlight the potential of algae for the production of recombinant proteins. The chloroplast organelle of algae and plants also is a particularly favorable site for recombinant protein production. Due to the presence of chaperones and foldases required for correct assembly of complex eukaryotic proteins imported from the cytosol, the chloroplast is well-suited for production of mammalian proteins that are both soluble and correctly folded. Algal-based production systems also offer tremendous advantages over traditional, as well as many alternative, expression platforms when it comes to speed, scalability, COGs and perhaps most importantly capital costs. However, despite demonstration of the feasibility of expressing human antibodies containing Fc domains in the chloroplasts of microalgae, no certainty was afforded that algae and their chloroplast organelles were amenable to expression and accumulation of chimeric or non-antibody molecules containing mammalian Fc domains.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0009] The present invention discloses a method using plastid (chloroplast) organelle expression to generate fusion proteins that incorporate immunoglobulin-derived Fc domains suitable for conferring improved serum stability to therapeutic proteins. In addition, the method provides for efficient isolation and purification of such fusion proteins from complex extracts. These fused molecules may modulate the interaction between proteins containing stereoselective \n\n binding domains and specific ligands. The present invention also discloses nucleic acid constructs encoding such fusion proteins and the use of these fusion proteins in the treatment of various disorders, including inflammatory, metabolic and proliferative disorders. By incorporating an Fc domain capable of interacting with the neonatal FcRn receptor, it is possible to extend the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic proteins, thus minimizing adverse reactions caused by high doses, decreasing the frequency of injection, maximizing trancytosis to specific tissue sites, and decreasing production costs by reducing the dosage required to gain a useful pharmacological effect. In addition, expression of Fc- fusion proteins in the chloroplast results in the absence of asparagine-linked glycosylation on the Fc domain, thus prevents unwanted or undesired activation of Fc-mediated effector functions.\n\n\n[00010] hi one embodiment, a nucleic acid construct is disclosed including, in operable linkage, nucleic acid signaling elements for homologous recombination and expression of the fusion protein in a plant or algae plastid and a first polynucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide including an Fc region and a second polynucleotide sequence encoding an extracellular domain (ECD) of a receptor or surface glycoprotein, a growth factor, a cytokine, or an enzyme, such as a metabolic enzyme whose deficiency results in a clinical disease state, where the first and second polynucleotide sequences are expressed as a fusion protein.

The receptor domain in B is underlined, the hinge region is in red (bold) and the c- terminal FLAG tag is in Bold italics. [0034] Figure 3 graphically illustrates the generation of C. reinhardtii chloroplast transformants expressing mAbs.\n\n\n[0035] Figure 4 shows the expression of HSV8-lsc by SDS PAGE and Western blot. Left Panel: Expression of HSV8-lsc in E. coli and C. reinhardtii chloroplast. Proteins were separated into soluble and insoluble phases by centrifugation. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue or blotted to nitrocellulose and hybridized with an antiflag antibody. Right Panel: The chloroplast expressed proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose and hybridized with an anti-flag antibody. The arrow in the non-reduced (no-βME) lane indicates a band corresponding to an assembled dimeric antibody of approximately 130 kDa. [0036] Figure 5 shows the accumulation of HS V8 scfv antibody. Left Panel: Accumulation of HSV8 scfv antibody throughout the light dark cycle when grown at either 10\n6\n or 10\n7\n cells per ml and illustrates the fact that the resulting scfv is completely soluble. Right Panel: ELISA assay of fourteen independent transformants expressing HS V8 scfv, and shows that all the scfvs are able to bind glycoprotein D, its target antigen, from crude extract with out purification. This panel also illustrates the limited (less than two fold) variability typically seen among chloroplast transformants.\n\n\n[0037] Figure 6 shows the simultaneous accumulation of HSV8 LC and HC proteins in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii. Panel A, top , shows the psbH region in the recipient strain, psbHΔ, used in these transformants. Note the strain contains the aphA6 cassette driven by the psbA 5' and rbcL 3' UTRs. Transforming constructs 7, 9, 31, and 8 were constructed by replacing the BamHI fragment containing the aphA6 cassette with the corresponding divergent promoter constructs shown below. Panel B shows a western blot of four independent transformants with the HSV8 lsc expressing strain as a control. Note that the orientations of the HC and LC genes in the vector make both heavy chain and light chain protein, showing that both promoter-UTRs work well, and that orientation of the coding region does not impact expression using this vector.\n\n\n[0038] Figure 7 shows that C. reinhardtii chloroplast expressed IgAs assemble into full length mAbs. Total soluble protein from strain 9-4-4 seen in Figure 5 was subjected to flag- affinity chromatography. Equal volumes of flow-thru, wash and elution tractions were run on \n\n SDS PAGE with and without no-βME as indicated. Crude extracts and elution fractions 1-5 in the presence of βME shows LC and HC proteins migrating as discrete bands of 26 and 53 kDa, respectively. In the absence of βME, however, elution fractions 1-5 clearly show a coalescence of these bands into a larger product of ca. 160 kDa, the size expected for the fully assembled IgA.\n\n\n[0039] Figure 8 (A) shows various C. reinhardtii chloroplast 5' promoter/UTR fragments as BamHI/Ndel restriction fragments. ecFcεRIα-hlgGl or ecFcεRIα genes, assembled in C. reinhardtii chloroplast codon bias are shown as Ndel/Xbal fragments. 3' UTRs are shown as Xbal/BamHI fragments. Any resulting 5' promoter/UTR driving ecFcεRIα-hlgGl or ecFcεRIα followed by any 3 'UTR can subsequently be cloned into either p322 (Franklin et al, 2002) or psbH vectors as a BamHI insert. (B) shows that the divergent promoter/UTR can drive simultaneous expression of either ecFcεRIα-hlgGl or ecFcεRIα. Any 3' UTR can be utilized in this construct so long as it can be cloned as an Xbal/BamHI fragment. As seen in the Figure, the resulting cassette consisting of divergent promoter/5' UTR driving two copies of either ecFcεRIα-hlgGl or ecFcεRIα, followed by a 3' UTR is clonable as a BamHI fragment. This entire cassette can be subsequently cloned into either p322 or p3Hb.\n\n\n[0040] Figure 9 shows an anti-FLAG western blot analysis of samples prepared from psbD line expressing the IgERl-Fc receptor fusion (A; SEQ ID NO:1 and SEQ ID NO:2). The transplastomic line was grown at two light fluxes, 6 or 58 μEinsteins, as indicated, to a density of 5E\n6\n cells per ml. 20 μg of total soluble protein was run in crude lysate lane, while 7.5 μl of sample was rune in the Flow Thru (FT), 15 μl in wash fraction and 3.75 μl in El fractions. The final concentration sample (E2-17) represents 25% of the final pooled sample. The full length IgERl-Fc receptor fusion has a theoretical MW of 48.7 kDa. FLAG tagged bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP FLAG) was run as an internal control.\n\n\n[0041] Figure 10 shows the nucleotide (A; SEQ ID NO:3) and amino acid (B; SEQ ID NO:4) sequences for the murine light chain encoding NT73. The FLAG tag, is indicated in bold italics (B). Nucleotide (C; SEQ ID NO:5) and amino acid (D; SEQ ID NO:6) sequences for the murine heavy chain encoding NT73. The FLAG Tag in D is indicated by bold italics. [0042] Figure 11 shows the purification of mlgGl from C. reinhardtii chloroplasts. Alga expressed mlgGl were electrophoresed on 4-20% Tris-Glycine gels and either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (left panel) or subjected to western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody (right panel). Samples run on Coomassie stained gel represent 5 or 10% of the total concentrated lysates. \n\n [0043] Figure 12 shows the nucleotide (A; SEQ ED NO:7) and amino acid (B; SEQ ID NO:8) sequence for the chimeric human light chain encoding NT73. The FLAG Tag in B is indicated by bold italics. Nucleotide (C; SEQ ID NO:9) and amino acid (D; SEQ ID NO: 10) for chimeric human heavy chain encoding NT73. The FLAG Tag in D is indicated by bold italics [0044] Figure 13 shows the purification of hlgGl from C. reinhardtii chloroplasts. Alga expressed hlgGl were electrophoresed on 4-20% Tris Glycine gels and either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (left panel) or subjected to western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody (right panel). Samples run on Coomassie stained gels represent 5% of the total concentrated lysates. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0045] Before the present composition, methods, and treatment methodology are described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular compositions, methods, and experimental conditions described, as such compositions, methods, and conditions may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for purposes of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present invention will be limited only in the appended claims.\n\n\n[0046] As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms \"a\", \"an\", and \"the\" include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, references to \"the method\" includes one or more methods, and/or steps of the type described herein which will become apparent to those persons skilled in the art upon reading this disclosure and so forth.\n\n\n[0047] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, the preferred methods and materials are now described.\n\n\n[0048] Modulating the potential negative impacts of molecules involved in disease progression is central to most current therapies. One approach to controlling the negative effects of such molecules is to prevent their interaction with receptors or other molecules that are required for the manifestation of the diseased state. The development of monoclonal antibodies that bind to these molecules, preventing their interactions, is central to the mechanism of action for several currently marketed therapeutics (i.e., Humira, Remicade and the like). [0049] Rather than developing therapeutics de novo, as is the case with monoclonal antibodies, an alternative, but equally viable approach utilizes soluble receptors fused to Fc \n\n regions (Typically hinge, C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3 domains of heavy chain MgGl, 2, 3, 4 or IgA, IgE, IgM or IgD molecules) of monoclonal antibodies. These Fc regions may be native, or modified in ways that increase or decrease their affinity with specific Fc receptors. For example, modifications to the Fc region of hlgGl molecules can increase their interaction with FcγRIII on effector cells, thereby modulating ADCC. Likewise, modifications to Fc regions on hlgGl can impact their interactions with FcγRIIB, the inhibitory Fc receptor, on effector cells, again to modulate ADCC. Modifications such as elimination of glycosylation (as would be induced by chloroplast organelle expression) can serve to abrogate some receptor-mediated functions without affecting interaction with the neonatal FcRn receptor which binds to the correctly folded CH2-CH3 hinge region in a non-glycosylation dependent manner.\n\n\n[0050] Such Fc-receptor fusion molecules provide high affinity \"traps\" for their ligands, titrating them out of solution, with a high degree of specificity. The Fc portion of these molecules imparts increased half life to these molecules through their increased size and recycling through the neonatal receptor as well as a standardized and potentially modifiable means of purification via Protein A or G affinity chromatography. In one aspect, the fusion protein comprises a cleavable linker between the Fc and the fusion/therapeutic protein domain in order to effect efficient recovery after protein capture.\n\n\n[0051] Another application of Fc fusion proteins as disclosed is for increasing the potency of other, non- receptor, protein moieties, including, but not limited to, growth factors, granulocyte cytokines, and enzymes, which are fused to Fc regions. While not being bound by theory, this increase in potency may be conferred by several mechanisms, including, but not limited to, increasing molecular weight leading to oligomerization. Such oligomerization can result in decreased loss of the therapeutic moiety via renal filtration. Also, more favorable pharmacokinetics may be obtained, where the Fc moiety confers Fc-mediated recycling to the therapeutic moiety. In one embodiment, a nucleic acid construct is disclosed including, in operable linkage, nucleic acid signaling elements for homologous recombination and expression of the fusion protein in a plant or algae plastid and a first polynucleotide sequence encoding a first polypeptide and a second polynucleotide sequence encoding a soluble receptor, where the first and second polynucleotide sequences are expressed as a fusion protein. [0052] In one embodiment, a nucleic acid construct is disclosed including, in operable linkage, nucleic acid signaling elements for homologous recombination and expression of the fusion protein in a plant or algae plastid and a first polynucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide consisting essentially of an Fc region and a second polynucleotide sequence \n\n encoding an extracellular domain (ECD) of a receptor or surface glycoprotein, a growth factor, cytokine or an enzyme.\n\n\n[0053] For example, the present invention discloses the expression of the extracellular domain of the high affinity soluble receptor of IgE, ecFcεRIα, alone and as a fusion protein with the hinge C\nH\n2 and C\nR\n3 domains of human IgGl . While not being bound by theory, such a fusion protein binds to circulating IgE, specifically at the point of interaction with the FcεRIα, and prevents cross linking of IgE molecules on the surface of mast cells and subsequent release of allergic response mediators, including, but not limited to, TNFα, IL4, ILl 3, histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, as well as the proteases tryptase and chymase (Pawankar et al., 2003; Hart, 2001). Further, such a fusion protein has therapeutic applications, including but not limited to, the treatment of allergic asthma. Moreover, given the expected rapid clearance rate for ecFcεRIα, fusion with an antibody fragment increases the stability of the receptor domain in sera, making such a receptor domain a more efficacious agent. Also, as expression of ecFcεRIα has been shown to have higher affinity for IgE in an non-glycosylated form, expression of the properly folded but non-glycosylated protein in chloroplasts provides a cost effective means to produce such non-glycosylated forms of an ECD.\n\n\n[0054] As used herein \"extracellular domain (ECD)\" means a part of a receptor that projects out of the membrane on the outside of the cell or organelle. If the polypeptide chain of a receptor crosses the bilayer several times, the external domain may comprise several extrinsic \"loops\" protruding from the hydrophobic membrane. By definition, a receptor's main function is to recognize and respond to a specific ligand, for example, a neurotransmitter or hormone (although certain receptors respond also to changes in transmembrane potential), and in many receptors these ligands bind to the extracellular domain. Typically, soluble forms of receptors consist essentially of the ECD of a transmembrane receptor. For example, such ECDs include, but are not limited to, IL- 17 receptor ECD, TNFα receptor ECD, high affinity IgE receptor ECD, low affinity IgE receptor ECD, α chain high affinity IL-4 receptor ECD, IL-5 receptor ECD, IL- 13 receptor ECD, and IL-2 receptor ECD. Amino acid sequences for these receptors are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, respectively, AAB99730 (IL-17 receptor); NP_001057 (TNF α receptor); Q01362 (IgE high affinity receptor); P06734 (IgE low affinity receptor); P24394 (α chain high affinity IL-4 receptor); NP 000555 (IL-5 receptor); P31785 (IL- 2 receptor γ chain), NP 000408 (IL-2 receptor α chain), NP_000869 (IL-2 receptor β chain); AAA58389 (CTLA-4); AAB86809 (RANK); and AAB26852 (tissue factor). [0055] As used herein \"surface glycoprotein\" is a conjugated protein which projects out of the membrane on the outside of the cell or organelle containing a non-protein moiety which is a \n\n carbohydrate. The glycoprotein need not be in a transmembrane form when present on a cell, and may simply be anchored to the cell surface in the native state. For the present invention, glycoproteins are in a soluble form and include, but are not limited to, integrins, immunoglobulin superfamily members, selectins, and cadherins. [0056] As used herein \"cognate\" is used in a comparative sense to refer to genetic elements that are typically associated with a specific reference gene. For example, for the Photosystem II (PSII) gene psbA (i.e., a specific reference gene), cognate genetic elements would include, but are not limited to, apsbA promoter, psbA 5' UTR, and psbA 3' UTR. Contrapositively, \"non- cognate\" would refer to genetic elements that are not typically related to a specific reference gene. For example, but not limited to, where a chimeric construct comprising a. psbA promoter and psbD 5' UTR is to be homologously recombined at apsbA site, the 5' UTR in the construct would be non-cognate to psbA.\n\n\n[0057] As used herein \"nucleic acid signaling element\" is used broadly herein to refer to a nucleotide sequence that regulates the transcription or translation of a polynucleotide or the localization of a polypeptide to which it is operatively linked. A nucleic acid signaling element can be a promoter, enhancer, transcription terminator, an initiation (start) codon, a splicing signal for intron excision and maintenance of a correct reading frame, a STOP codon, an amber or ochre codon, an IRES, an RBS, a sequence encoding a protein intron (intein) acceptor or donor splice site, or a sequence that targets a polypeptide to a particular location, for example, a cell compartmentalization signal, which can be useful for targeting a polypeptide to the cytosol, nucleus, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial membrane or matrix, chloroplast membrane or lumen, medial trans-Golgi cisternae, or a lysosome or endosome. Cell compartmentalization domains are well known in the art and include, for example, a peptide containing amino acid residues 1 to 81 of human type II membrane-anchored protein galactosyltransferase, the chloroplast targeting domain from the nuclear-encoded small subunit of plant ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, or amino acid residues 1 to 12 of the presequence of subunit IV of cytochrome c oxidase (see, also, Hancock et al., EMBO J 10:4033-4039, 1991; Buss et al., MoI. Cell. Biol. 8:3960-3963, 1988; U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,689). Inclusion of a cell compartmentalization domain in a polypeptide produced using a method of the invention can allow use of the polypeptide, which can comprise a protein complex, where it is desired to target the polypeptide to a particular cellular compartment in a cell.\n\n\n[0058] As used herein \"immuno-activating (IA) domain\" means a region of a immuno- effector protein capable of modulating effector cells of the immune system through the interaction between proteins containing stereoselective binding domains and specific ligands. \n\n Such ligands include, but are not limited to, immunoglobulins, cytokines, growth factors, tissue factors, and the like. For example, IgE, IL-lα, IL-lβ, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL- 9, IL-IO, IL-12, IL-13, IL-14, IL-15, IL-17, INF- α, INF- β, INF-γ, MIP-Ia, MIP-Ib, TGF- β, RANTES, MCP-I, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, PF-4, G-CSF, GM-CSF, NGF, BDNF, NT3, PDGF, EPO, TPO, myostatin, GDF9, bFGF, EGF, and HGF represent such ligands. Amino acid sequences for these ligands are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, respectively, GenBank Ace. Nos. AAD41753 (IgE heavy chain), CAD54753 (IgE light chain); CAA27448 (IL-I α); NP_000567 (IL-I β); CAA073317 (IL-2); AAC08706 (IL-3); NP_758858 (IL-4); NP_CAA09587 (IL-5); NP 000591 (IL-6); NP 000871 (IL-7); AAH13615 (IL-8); AAC 17735 (IL-9); NP_000563 (IL- 10); 1 F45_B (IL- 12 Chain B), P29459 (IL- 12 Chain A);\n\n\nNP_002179 (IL-13); CAA86100 (IL-15); AAV41220 (IL-17); AAA52716 (INF-α); AAC41702 (INF-β); AAB59534 (INF-γ); 1B53_B (MIP-Ia Chain B), 1B53_A (MIP-Ia Chain A); NP_002975 (MIPIb); AAA36735 (TGF-β); AAC03541 (RANTES); AAB29926 (MCP-I); CAA76341 (MCP-2); CAB51055 (MCP-3); AAB67307 (MCP4); P02776 (PF-4); CAA01319 (G-CSF); AAA52578 (GM-CSF); CAA37703 (NGF); CAA62632 (BDNF); AAI07076 (NT3); AAB26566 (PDGF A Chain), POl 127 (PDGF B Chain); AAF23134 (EPO); AAB33390 (TPO); NP_005250; AAH96228 (GDF9); AAB21432 (bFGF); NP 001954; and AAA64297 (HGF). [0059] As used herein \"cell surface target\" means a polypeptide, carbohydrate, lipid or a combination thereof on the plasma surface of a cell. In one embodiment, such targets include clusters of differentiation (CD), including, but are not limited to, CDl, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD6, CD7, CD8, CD9, CDlO, CDl Ia, CDl Ib, CDl Ic, CDl Id, CDwl2, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD15s, CD16, CDwl7, CD18, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, Cd24, CD25, CD26, CD27, CD28, CD29, CD30, CD31, CD32, CD33, CD34, CD35, CD36, CD37, CD38, CD39, CD40, CD41, CD42, CD43, CD44, CD45, CD45RO, CD45RA, CD45RB, CD46, CD47, CD48, CD49a, CD49b, CD49c, CD49d, CD49e, CD49f, CD50, CD51, CD52, CD53, CD54, CD55, CD56, CD57, CD58, CD59, CDw60, CD61, CD62E, CD62L, CD62P, CD63, CD64, CD65, CD66a, CD66b, CD66c, CD66d, CD66e, and the like.\n\n\n[0060] As used herein \"multifunctional\" means having at least two functions. For example, a fusion protein comprising a binding domain and a ECD would be bifunctional. [0061] As used herein \"progeny\" means a descendant or offspring, as a child, plant or animal. For example, daughter cells from a transgenic algae are progeny of the transgenic algae. [0062] As used herein \"transgene\" means any gene carried by a vector or vehicle, where the vector or vehicle includes, but is not limited to, plasmids and viral vectors. \n\n [0063] In a related aspect, integration of chimeric constructs into plastid genomes includes homologous recombination. In a further related aspect, cells transformed by the methods of the present invention may be homoplasmic or heteroplasmic for the integration, wherein homoplastic means all copies of the transformed plastid genome carry the same chimeric construct.\n\n\n[0064] As used herein, the term \"modulate\" refers to a qualitative or quantitative increase or decrease in the amount of an expressed gene product. For example, where the use of light increases or decreases the measured amount of protein or RNA expressed by a cell, such light modulates the expression of that protein or RNA. In one aspect, modulation of expression includes autoregulation, where \"autoregulation\" refers to processes that maintain a generally constant physiological state in a cell or organism, and includes autorepression and autoinduction. [0065] In a related aspect, autorepression is a process by which excess endogenous protein or endogenous mRNA results in decreasing the amount of expression of that endogenous protein. In a further related aspect, reduction of endogenous protein synthesis will result in increased transgene expression. In one aspect, operatively linking non-cognate genetic elements (e.g., promoters) to the endogenous gene is used to drive low levels of endogenous protein expression. In another aspect, mutations are introduced into the endogenous gene sequence and/or cognate genetic elements to reduce expression of the endogenous protein. [0066] As used herein, the term \"multiple cloning site\" is used broadly to refer to any nucleotide or nucleotide sequence that facilitates linkage of a first polynucleotide to a second polynucleotide. Generally, a cloning site comprises one or a plurality of restriction endonuclease recognition sites, for example, a cloning site, or one or a plurality of recombinase recognition sites, for example, a loxP site or an att site, or a combination of such sites. The cloning site can be provided to facilitate insertion or linkage, which can be operative linkage, of the first and second polynucleotide, for example, a first polynucleotide encoding a first 5' UTR operatively linked to second polynucleotide comprising a homologous coding sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest, linked to a first 3' UTR, which is to be translated in a prokaryote or a chloroplast or both. [0067] hi one embodiment, a chimeric construct is disclosed including a PSII reaction center protein gene promoter, PSII gene 5' UTR, a multiple cloning site (MCS), and a PSII gene 3* UTR, having the configuration:\n\n\nPSII gene promoter-PSII gene 5' UTR-MCS-PSII gene 3' UTR. \n\n [0068] In a related aspect, the PSII gene UTRs are from different PSII genes and may include, but are not limited to, a psbD 5' UTR and apsbA 5' UTR.\n\n\n[0069] In another related aspect, the PSII gene promoter is apsbA or psbD promoter and the 3' UTR is a/wA_4 3' UTR. [0070] In one aspect, the PSII gene promoter and PSII gene 5' UTR are from psbD. In another aspect, the PSII gene 3' UTR is apsbA 3 ' UTR.\n\n\n[0071] As used herein, the term \"Photosystem II reaction center\" refers to an intrinsic membrane-protein complex in the chloroplast made of Dl (psbA gene), D2 (psbD gene), alpha and beta subunits of cytochrome b-559 (psbE and psbF genes respectively), the psbl gene product and a few low molecular weight proteins (e.g., 9 kDa peptide [psbH gene] and 6.5 kDa peptide [psbWgene]). In a related aspect, endogenous genes embrace chloroplast genes that exhibit autoregulation of translation, and include, but are not limited to, cytochrome/ (i.e., C- terminal domain) and photosystem I reaction center genes (e.g.,psαA, PsαB, PsαC, PsαJ). [0072] As used herein, the term \"operatively linked\" means that two or more molecules are positioned with respect to each other such that they act as a single unit and effect a function attributable to one or both molecules or a combination thereof. For example, a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide can be operatively linked to a transcriptional or translational regulatory element, in which case the element confers its regulatory effect on the polynucleotide similarly to the way in which the regulatory element would effect a polynucleotide sequence with which it normally is associated with in a cell.\n\n\n[0073] The term \"polynucleotide\" or \"nucleotide sequence\" or \"nucleic acid molecule\" is used broadly herein to mean a sequence of two or more deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides that are linked together by a phosphodiester bond. As such, the terms include RNA and DNA, which can be a gene or a portion thereof, a cDNA, a synthetic polydeoxyribonucleic acid sequence, or the like, and can be single stranded or double stranded, as well as a DNA/RNA hybrid.\n\n\nFurthermore, the terms as used herein include naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules, which can be isolated from a cell, as well as synthetic polynucleotides, which can be prepared, for example, by methods of chemical synthesis or by enzymatic methods such as by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It should be recognized that the different terms are used only for convenience of discussion so as to distinguish, for example, different components of a composition, except that the term \"synthetic polynucleotide\" as used herein refers to a polynucleotide that has been modified to reflect chloroplast codon usage. [0074] In general, the nucleotides comprising a polynucleotide are naturally occurring deoxyribonucleotides, such as adenine, cytosine, guanine or thymine linked to 2'-deoxyribose, or \n\n ribonucleotides such as adenine, cytosine, guanine or uracil linked to ribose. Depending on the use, however, a polynucleotide also can contain nucleotide analogs, including non-naturally occurring synthetic nucleotides or modified naturally occurring nucleotides. Nucleotide analogs are well known in the art and commercially available (e.g., Ambion, Inc.; Austin Tex.), as are polynucleotides containing such nucleotide analogs (Lin et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 22:5220-5234, 1994; Jellinek et al., Biochemistry 34:11363-11372, 1995; Pagratis et al., Nature Biotechnol. 15:68-73, 1997). The covalent bond linking the nucleotides of a polynucleotide generally is a phosphodiester bond. However, depending on the purpose for which the polynucleotide is to be used, the covalent bond also can be any of numerous other bonds, including a thiodiester bond, a phosphorothioate bond, a peptide-like bond or any other bond known to those in the art as useful for linking nucleotides to produce synthetic polynucleotides (see, for example, Tarn et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 22:977-986, 1994; Ecker and Crooke, BioTechnology 13:351360, 1995). [0075] A polynucleotide comprising naturally occurring nucleotides and phosphodiester bonds can be chemically synthesized or can be produced using recombinant DNA methods, using an appropriate polynucleotide as a template. In comparison, a polynucleotide comprising nucleotide analogs or covalent bonds other than phosphodiester bonds generally will be chemically synthesized, although an enzyme such as T7 polymerase can incorporate certain types of nucleotide analogs into a polynucleotide and, therefore, can be used to produce such a polynucleotide recombinantly from an appropriate template (Jellinek et al., supra, 1995). [0076] The term \"recombinant nucleic acid molecule\" is used herein to refer to a polynucleotide that is manipulated by human intervention. A recombinant nucleic acid molecule can contain two or more nucleotide sequences that are linked in a manner such that the product is not found in a cell in nature. In particular, the two or more nucleotide sequences can be operatively linked and, for example, can encode a fusion polypeptide, or can comprise an encoding nucleotide sequence and a regulatory element, particularly a PSII promoter operatively linked to a PSII 5' UTR. A recombinant nucleic acid molecule also can be based on, but manipulated so as to be different, from a naturally occurring polynucleotide, for example, a polynucleotide having one or more nucleotide changes such that a first codon, which normally is found in the polynucleotide, is biased for chloroplast codon usage, or such that a sequence of interest is introduced into the polynucleotide, for example, a restriction endonuclease recognition site or a splice site, a promoter, a DNA origin of replication, or the like.\n\n\n[0077] One or more codons of an encoding polynucleotide can be biased to reflect chloroplast codon usage. Most amino acids are encoded by two or more different (degenerate) codons, and it is well recognized that various organisms utilize certain codons in preference to others. Such \n\n preferential codon usage, which also is utilized in chloroplasts, is referred to herein as \"chloroplast codon usage\". Table 1 (below) shows the chloroplast codon usage for C. reinhardtii (see US2004/0014174, published January 22, 2004).

A polynucleotide that is biased for chloroplast codon usage can be synthesized de novo, or can be genetically modified using routine recombinant DNA techniques, for example, by a site directed mutagenesis method, to change one or more codons such that they are biased for chloroplast codon usage. As disclosed herein, chloroplast codon bias can be variously skewed in different plants, including, for example, in alga chloroplasts as compared to tobacco. \n\n [0079] Table 1 exemplifies codons that are preferentially used in algal chloroplast genes. The term \"chloroplast codon usage\" is used herein to refer to such codons, and is used in a comparative sense with respect to degenerate codons that encode the same amino acid but are less likely to be found as a codon in a chloroplast gene. The term \"biased\", when used in reference to chloroplast codon usage, refers to the manipulation of a polynucleotide such that one or more nucleotides of one or more codons is changed, resulting in a codon that is preferentially used in chloroplasts. Chloroplast codon bias is exemplified herein by the alga chloroplast codon bias as set forth in Table 1. The chloroplast codon bias can, but need not, be selected based on a particular plant in which a synthetic polynucleotide is to be expressed. The manipulation can be a change to a codon, for example, by a method such as site directed mutagenesis, by a method such as PCR using a primer that is mismatched for the nucleotide(s) to be changed such that the amplification product is biased to reflect chloroplast codon usage, or can be the de novo synthesis of polynucleotide sequence such that the change (bias) is introduced as a consequence of the synthesis procedure. [0080] In addition to utilizing chloroplast codon bias as a means to provide efficient translation of a polypeptide, it will be recognized that an alternative means for obtaining efficient translation of a polypeptide in a chloroplast to re-engineer the chloroplast genome (e.g., a C. reinhardtii chloroplast genome) for the expression of tRNAs not otherwise expressed in the chloroplast genome. Such an engineered algae expressing one or more heterologous tRNA molecules provides the advantage that it would obviate a requirement to modify every polynucleotide of interest that is to be introduced into and expressed from a chloroplast genome; instead, algae such as C. reinhardtii that comprise a genetically modified chloroplast genome can be provided and utilized for efficient translation of a polypeptide according to a method of the invention. Correlations between tRNA abundance and codon usage in highly expressed genes is well known (Franklin et al., Plant J. 30:733-744, 2002; Dong et al., J. MoI. Biol. 260:649-663, 1996; Duret, Trends Genet. 16:287-289, 2000; Goldman et. al., J. MoI. Biol. 245:467-473, 1995; Komar et. al., Biol. Chem. 379:1295-1300, 1998). In E. coli, for example, re-engineering of strains to express underutilized tRNAs resulted in enhanced expression of genes which utilize these codons (see Novy et al., in Novations 12:1-3, 2001). Utilizing endogenous tRNA genes, site directed mutagenesis can be used to make a synthetic tRNA gene, which can be introduced into chloroplasts to complement rare or unused tRNA genes in a chloroplast genome such as a C. reinhardtii chloroplast genome. \n\n [0081] Generally, the chloroplast codon bias selected for purposes of the present invention, including, for example, in preparing a synthetic polynucleotide as disclosed herein reflects chloroplast codon usage of a plant chloroplast, and includes a codon bias that, with respect to the third position of a codon, is skewed towards AfT, for example, where the third position has greater than about 66% AT bias, particularly greater than about 70% AT bias. As such, chloroplast codon biased for purposes of the present invention excludes the third position bias observed, for example, in Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco), which has 34.56% GC bias in the third codon position (Morton BR, J MoI Evol (1993) 37(3):273-80). In one embodiment, the chloroplast codon usage is biased to reflect alga chloroplast codon usage, for example, C. reinhardtii, which has about 74.6% AT bias in the third codon position.\n\n\n[0082] In one embodiment, a method to produce multifunctional fusion polypeptides/proteins is disclosed. The term \"polypeptides/protein\" is used broadly to refer to macromolecules comprising linear polymers of amino acids which act in biological systems, for example, as structural components (e.g., Fc regions), enzymes, chemical messengers, receptors, ligands, regulators, hormones, and the like. In one aspect, a plant cell or algae cell or progeny thereof is disclosed which contains a construct, where the construct includes, in operable linkage, nucleic acid signaling elements for homologous recombination and expression of the bifunctional fusion protein in a plant or algae plastid and a first polynucleotide sequence encoding a first polypeptide and a second polynucleotide sequence encoding an ECD, where the first and second polynucleotide sequences are expressed as a fusion protein. In another aspect, the fusion protein may include stabilizing molecules or domains, such as low complexity linkers. Such stabilizing molecules may form tripartite structures, which may include a stabilizing domain-Fc domain- ECD-domain. In one aspect, a fusion protein may comprise one or more stabilizing domains. Such tripartite molecules may also contain a small molecule drug, including, but not limited to therapeutic compounds. In one aspect, the tripartite molecule may comprise a cleavage domain (e.g., but not limited to, TEV protease recognition site).\n\n\n[0083] In a related aspect, such tripartite molecules may be encoded by a single polynucleotide. In another aspect, a functional Fc domain of the tripartite molecule may comprise multimers of subunits to form a multimeric complex, where the tripartite structure is encoded with a first subunit of a multimer. The second or third or more subunits of the multimeric complex may be encoded on separate polynucleotides. In one aspect, the second, third or more subunits are integrated into different sites in the chloroplast genome, where each integrated subunit encoding polynucleotide comprises separate recombinational targeting \n\n sequences, promoters/5' UTR regulatory sequences, and 3' UTR sequences. In one aspect, the multimeric complex comprises a heavy chain and a light chain of an complete antibody. [0084] In one embodiment, such fusion protein comprise multiple binding domains for targeting multiple surface markers. In one aspect, the fusion protein includes one or more ECDs which target specific ligands.\n\n\n[0085] Li another aspect, such polypeptides/proteins would include functional protein complexes, such as antibodies. The term \"antibody\" is used broadly herein to refer to a polypeptide or a protein complex that can specifically bind an epitope of an antigen. Generally, an antibody contains at least one antigen binding domain that is formed by an association of a heavy chain variable region domain and a light chain variable region domain, particularly the hypervariable regions. An antibody generated according to a method of the invention can be based on naturally occurring antibodies, for example, bivalent antibodies, which contain two antigen binding domains formed by first heavy and light chain variable regions and second heavy and light chain variable regions (e.g., an IgG or IgA isotype) or by a first heavy chain variable region and a second heavy chain variable region (V\nHH\n antibodies; see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,079), or on non-naturally occurring antibodies, including, for example, single chain antibodies, chimeric antibodies, bifunctional antibodies, and humanized antibodies, as well as antigen-binding fragments of an antibody, for example, an Fab fragment, an Fd fragment, an Fv fragment, and the like. In a related aspect, a heterologous gene encodes a single chain antibody comprising a heavy chain operatively linked to a light chain.\n\n\n[0086] In another related aspect, polynucleotides useful for practicing a method of the producing such antibodies can be isolated from cells producing the antibodies of interest, for example, B cells from an immunized subject or from an individual exposed to a particular antigen, can be synthesized de novo using well known methods of polynucleotide synthesis, can be produced recombinant^ or can be obtained, for example, by screening combinatorial libraries of polynucleotides that encode variable heavy chains and variable light chains (see Huse et al., Science 246:1275-1281 (1989)) and can be biased for chloroplast codon usage, if desired (see Table 1). These and other methods of making polynucleotides encoding, for example, chimeric, humanized, CDR-grafted, single chain, and bifunctional antibodies are well known to those skilled in the art (Winter and Harris, Immunol. Today 14:243-246, 1993; Ward et al., Nature 341:544-546, 1989; Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A laboratory manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988); Hilyard et al., Protein Engineering: A practical approach (IRL Press 1992); Borrabeck, Antibody Engineering, 2d ed. (Oxford University Press 1995)). \n\n [0087] Polynucleotides encoding humanized monoclonal antibodies, for example, can be obtained by transferring nucleotide sequences encoding mouse complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from heavy and light variable chains of the mouse immunoglobulin gene into a human variable domain gene, and then substituting human residues in the framework regions of the murine counterparts. General techniques for cloning murine immunoglobulin variable domains are known (see, for example, Orlandi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 86:3833, 1989), as are methods for producing humanized monoclonal antibodies (see, for example, Jones et al., Nature 321:522, 1986; Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323, 1988; Verhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534, 1988; Carter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 89:4285, 1992; Sandhu, Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 12:437, 1992; and Singer et al., J. Immunol. 150:2844, 1993).\n\n\n[0088] The disclosed methods can also be practiced using polynucleotides encoding human antibody fragments isolated from a combinatorial immunoglobulin library (see, for example, Barbas et al., Methods: A Companion to Methods in Immunology 2:119, 1991 ; Winter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol. 12:433, 1994). Cloning and expression vectors that are useful for producing a human immunoglobulin phage library can be obtained, for example, from Stratagene Cloning Systems (La Jolla, Calif.).\n\n\n[0089] A polynucleotide encoding a human monoclonal antibody also can be obtained, for example, from transgenic mice that have been engineered to produce specific human antibodies in response to antigenic challenge. In this technique, elements of the human heavy and light chain loci are introduced into strains of mice derived from embryonic stem cell lines that contain targeted disruptions of the endogenous heavy and light chain loci. The transgenic mice can synthesize human antibodies specific for human antigens, and the mice can be used to produce human antibody-secreting hybridomas, from which polynucleotides useful for practicing a method of the invention can be obtained. Methods for obtaining human antibodies from transgenic mice are described, for example, by Green et al., Nature Genet. 7:13, 1994; Lonberg et al., Nature 368:856, 1994; and Taylor et al., Intl. Immunol. 6:579, 1994; and such transgenic mice are commercially available (Abgenix, Inc.; Fremont Calif.).\n\n\n[0090] The polynucleotide also can be one encoding an antigen binding fragment of an antibody. Antigen binding antibody fragments, which include, for example, Fv, Fab, Fab', Fd, and F(ab')\n2\n fragments, are well known in the art, and were originally identified by proteolytic hydrolysis of antibodies. For example, antibody fragments can be obtained by pepsin or papain digestion of whole antibodies by conventional methods. Antibody fragments produced by enzymatic cleavage of antibodies with pepsin generate a 5S fragment denoted F(ab')\n2\n. This fragment can be further cleaved using a thiol reducing agent and, optionally, a blocking group \n\n for the sulfhydryl groups resulting from cleavage of disulfide linkages, to produce 3.5S Fab\n1\n monovalent fragments. Alternatively, an enzymatic cleavage using pepsin produces two monovalent Fab' fragments and an Fc fragment directly (see, for example, Goldenberg, U.S. Pat. No. 4,036,945 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,647; Nisonhoff et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 89:230. 1960; Porter, Biochem. J. 73:119, 1959; Edelman et al., Meth. Enzymol. 1:422 (Academic Press 1967); Coligan et al., In Curr. Protocols Immunol., 1992, see sections 2.8.1-2.8.10 and 2.10.1- 2.10.4). Alternatively, an isolated Fc region can be generated recombinantly by methods well known in the art. [0091] Another form of an antibody fragment is a peptide coding for a single complementarity-determining region (CDR). CDR peptides can be obtained by constructing a polynucleotide encoding the CDR of an antibody of interest, for example, by using the polymerase chain reaction to synthesize the variable region from RNA of antibody-producing cells (see, for example, Larrick et al., Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology 2:106, 1991). Polynucleotides encoding such antibody fragments, including subunits of such fragments and peptide linkers joining, for example, a heavy chain variable region and light chain variable region, can be prepared by chemical synthesis methods or using routine recombinant DNA methods, beginning with polynucleotides encoding full length heavy chains and light chains, which can be obtained as described above. [0092] Single celled algae, like C. reinhardtii, are essentially water borne plants and as such can produce proteins in a very cost effective manner. In addition, algae can be grown in complete containment, and there are a number of companies around the world that have developed large scale production of algae as human nutraceuticals or as a food source for farmed fish and other organisms. Capitalization costs for an algal production facility are much less than for other types of cell culture, mainly because of the nature of algae and it's ability to grow with minimal input, using CO\n2\n as a carbon source and sunlight as an energy source. Although in many ways algae are an ideal system for therapeutic protein production there are a number of technical challenges that need to be met before algae can be used as an efficient production platform. Among these challenges are developing vectors that allow for consistent high levels of protein expression, and facilitating purification of recombinant proteins from complex cell lysates. One aspect of the present invention is to utilize immunoglobulin Fc domains to enable efficient purification of fusion proteins from algal and algal chloroplast extracts. [0093] That such cells can be used to produce recombinant proteins is illustrated in Figure 3. Large scale, closed systems as illustrated, currently operate for the production of nutraceuticals and animal feeds. Expression of proteins exclusively in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii \n\n achieves far higher levels in this organelle than from genes transformed into the nucleus (Franklin et. al., 2002). For example, genes to be transformed into C. reinhardtii chloroplasts are first synthesized de novo in C reinhardtii codon bias and cloned into chloroplast expression cassettes. Cells of C. reinhardtii, spread onto agar plates, are then transformed with chloroplast expression cassettes via biolistics (1). Colonies typically appear within ten days. Selection is provided either by co-transformation with markers conferring antibiotic resistance or rescue of phototrophy in strains deleted for essential photosynthetic genes. Such strains can be transformed with multiple cassettes, conferring both antibiotic resistance and rescue of phototrophy (2). Generation of homoplasmic lines (whereby all 50-80 copies of the chloroplast genome have converted to the recombinant genotype as determined by Southern blot analysis) typically requires seven additional days (3). Hence, within 24 days, stably transformed, homoplasmic lines expressing the desired protein of interest are obtained. In ten more days, multiple, twenty liter cultures, run in batch or continuous mode, can be ready for harvest (4). Hence, from gene assembly to production of milligram quantities of mAb requires as little as 34 days. Once larger scale cultures are required, scale up to 400 L systems would require an additional week (5), while moving up to multiple 30,000 L systems, would require another ten days (6). Given the observed accumulation levels for scFv, large single chain and full-length mAbs, the system as disclosed may go from gene to gram amounts of antibody in as little as 51 days. Further, this system has been applied to both C. reinhardtii and a separate species, Haematococcus pluvialis, a close relative of C reinhardtii. Such cultures, at all of the indicated scales, may be run in batch, or semi-continuous mode. Cultures up to 20 L scale are easily run axenically in the lab, while larger cultures run at 400 to 30,000 L scale typically run for 60 days before requiring breakdown and cleaning in place. [0094] A recombinant nucleic acid molecule useful in a method of the invention can be contained in a vector. The vector can be any DNA construct useful for introducing a polynucleotide into a chloroplast and, preferably, includes a nucleotide sequence of chloroplast genomic DNA that is sufficient to undergo homologous recombination with chloroplast genomic DNA, for example, a nucleotide sequence comprising about 400 to 1500 or more substantially contiguous nucleotides of chloroplast genomic DNA. Chloroplast vectors and methods for selecting regions of a chloroplast genome for use as a vector are well known (see, for example, Bock, J. MoI. Biol. 312:425-438, 2001; see, also, Staub and Maliga, Plant Cell 4:39-45, 1992; Kavanagh et al.. Genetics 152:1111-1122, 1999). \n\n [0095] The entire chloroplast genome of C. reinhardtii has been sequenced (Maul et al., Plant Cell (2002) 14(11):2659-79; GenBank Ace. No. BK000554). Generally, the nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast genomic DNA is selected for targeting such that it is not a portion of a gene, including a regulatory sequence or coding sequence, particularly a gene that, if disrupted due to the homologous recombination event, would produce a deleterious effect with respect to the chloroplast, for example, for replication of the chloroplast genome, or to a plant cell containing the chloroplast. In this respect, the Accession No. disclosing the C. reinhardtii chloroplast genome sequence also provides maps showing coding and non-coding regions of the chloroplast genome, thus facilitating selection of a sequence useful for constructing a vector of the invention. For example, the chloroplast vector, p322, which is used in experiments disclosed herein, is a clone extending from the Eco (Eco RI) site at about position 143.1 kb to the Xho (Xho I) site at about position 148.5 kb.\n\n\n[0096] The vector also can contain any additional nucleotide sequences that facilitate use or manipulation of the vector, for example, one or more transcriptional regulatory elements, a sequence encoding a selectable marker, one or more cloning sites, and the like, hi one embodiment, the chloroplast vector contains a prokaryote origin of replication (ori), for example, an E. coli ori, thus providing a shuttle vector that can be passaged and manipulated in a prokaryote host cell as well as in a chloroplast. [0097] The methods of the present invention are exemplified using the microalga, C. reinhardtii. The use of microalgae to express a polypeptide or protein complex according to a method of the invention provides the advantage that large populations of the microalgae can be grown, including commercially (Cyanotech Corp.; Kailua-Kona HI), thus allowing for production and, if desired, isolation of large amounts of a desired product. However, the ability to express, for example, functional mammalian polypeptides, including protein complexes, in the chloroplasts of any plant allows for production of crops of such plants and, therefore, the ability to conveniently produce large amounts of the polypeptides.\n\n\n[0098] In one embodiment, a method of expressing a chimeric gene is disclosed including transforming an algae cell by replacing an endogenous chloroplast gene via integration of a chimeric construct having a heterologous coding sequence, a promoter sequence, and at least one UTR, wherein the promoter is cognate or non-cognate to the endogenous chloroplast gene, and cultivating the transformed algae cell. In one aspect, a gene product encoded by the heterologous coding sequence is constitutively expressed, hi a related aspect, the cells are homoplasmic for the integration. \n\n [0099] In another embodiment, a method of expressing a chimeric gene includes transforming an algae cell by replacing psbA via integration of a chimeric construct comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding the fusion protein as set forth in SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:4, a promoter sequence, and one or more UTRs, where the promoter is cognate or non-cognate to the endogenous chloroplast gene, and cultivating the transformed algae cell. In one aspect, at least two UTRs are psbA andpsbD UTRs. In a related aspect, the nucleic acid sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO:3) is driven by apsbA or other promoter.\n\n\n[00100] In one embodiment, an algae cell transformed by the methods of the invention is disclosed, where the algae includes, but is not limited to, Chlαmydomonαs reinhαrdtii. [00101] Accordingly, the methods of the invention can be practiced using any plant having chloroplasts, including, for example, macroalgae, for example, marine algae and seaweeds, as well as plants that grow in soil, for example, corn (Zea mays), Brassica sp. (e.g., B. napus, B. rapa, B. juncea), particularly those Brassica species useful as sources of seed oil, alfalfa (Medicago sativa), rice (Oryza sativa), rye (Secale cereale), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor, Sorghum vulgare), millet (e.g., pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), proso millet (Panicum miliaceum), foxtail millet (Setaria italica), finger millet (Eleusine coracana)), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), wheat (Triticum aestivum), soybean (Glycine max), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), potato (Solanum tuberosum), peanuts (Arachis hypogaea), cotton (Gossypium barbadense, Gossypium hirsutum), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatus), cassaya (Manihot esculenta), coffee (Cofea spp.), coconut (Cocos nucifera), pineapple (Ananas comosus), citrus trees (Citrus spp.), cocoa (Theobroma cacao), tea (Camellia sinensis), banana (Musa spp.), avocado (Persea ultilane), fig (Ficus casica), guava (Psidium guajava), mango (Mangifera indica), olive (Olea europaea), papaya (Carica papaya), cashew (Anacardium occidentale), macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia), almond (Prunus amygdalus), sugar beets (Beta vulgaris), sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), oats, duckweed (Lemna), barley, tomatoes\n\n\n(Lycopersicon esculentum), lettuce (e.g., Lactuca sativa), green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), lima beans (Phaseolus limensis), peas (Lathyrus spp.), and members of the genus Cucumis such as cucumber (C. sativus), cantaloupe (C. cantalupensis), and musk melon (C. melo). Ornamentals such as azalea (Rhododendron spp.), hydrangea (Macrophylla hydrangea), hibiscus (Hibiscus rosasanensis), roses (Rosa spp.), tulips (Tulipa spp.), daffodils (Narcissus spp.), petunias\n\n\n(Petunia hybrida), carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus), poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima), and chrysanthemum are also included. Additional ornamentals useful for practicing a method of the invention include impatiens, Begonia, Pelargonium, Viola, Cyclamen, Verbena, Vinca, Tagetes, Primula, Saint Paulia, Agertum, Amaranthus, Antihirrhinum, Aquilegia, Cineraria, Clover, \n\n Cosmo, Cowpea, Dahlia, Datura, Delphinium, Gerbera, Gladiolus, Gloxinia, Hippeastrum, Mesembryanthemum, Salpiglossos, and Zinnia. Conifers that may be employed in practicing the present invention include, for example, pines such as loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), slash pine (Pinus elliotii), ponderosa pme (Pinus ponderosa), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and Monterey pine (Pinus radiata), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii); Western hemlock (Tsuga ultilane); Sitka spruce (Picea glauca); redwood (Sequoia sempervirens); true firs such as silver fir (Abies amabilis) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea); and cedars such as Western red cedar (Thuja plicata) and Alaska yellow-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis). [00102] Leguminous plants useful for practicing a method of the invention include beans and peas. Beans include guar, locust bean, fenugreek, soybean, garden beans, cowpea, mung bean, lima bean, fava bean, lentils, chickpea, etc. Legumes include, but are not limited to, Arachis, e.g., peanuts, Vicia, e.g., crown vetch, hairy vetch, adzuki bean, mung bean, and chickpea, Lupinus, e.g., lupine, trifolium, Phaseolus, e.g., common bean and lima bean, Pisum, e.g., field bean, Melilotus, e.g., clover, Medicago, e.g., alfalfa, Lotus, e.g., trefoil, lens, e.g., lentil, and false indigo. Preferred forage and turf grass for use in the methods of the invention include alfalfa, orchard grass, tall fescue, perennial ryegrass, creeping bent grass, and redtop. Other plants useful in the invention include Acacia, aneth, artichoke, arugula, blackberry, canola, cilantro, Clementines, escarole, eucalyptus, fennel, grapefruit, honey dew, jicama, kiwifruit, lemon, lime, mushroom, nut, okra, orange, parsley, persimmon, plantain, pomegranate, poplar, radiata pine, radicchio, Southern pine, sweetgum, tangerine, triticale, vine, yams, apple, pear, quince, cherry, apricot, melon, hemp, buckwheat, grape, raspberry, chenopodium, blueberry, nectarine, peach, plum, strawberry, watermelon, eggplant, pepper, cauliflower, Brassica, e.g., broccoli, cabbage, ultilan sprouts, onion, carrot, leek, beet, broad bean, celery, radish, pumpkin, endive, gourd, garlic, snapbean, spinach, squash, turnip, ultilane, chicory, groundnut and zucchini. [00103] A method of the invention can generate a plant containing chloroplasts that are genetically modified to contain a stably integrated polynucleotide (i.e., transplastomes; see, for example, Hager and Bock, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 54:302-310, 2000; see, also, Bock, supra, 2001). The integrated polynucleotide can comprise, for example, an encoding polynucleotide operatively linked to a first and second UTR as defined herein. Accordingly, the present invention further provides a transgenic (transplastomic) plant, which comprises one or more chloroplasts containing a polynucleotide encoding one or more heterologous polypeptides, including polypeptides that can specifically associate to form a functional protein complex. [00104] The term \"plant\" is used broadly herein to refer to a eukaryotic organism containing plastids, particularly chloroplasts, and includes any such organism at any stage of development, \n\n or to part of a plant, including a plant cutting, a plant cell, a plant cell culture, a plant organ, a plant seed, and a plantlet. A plant cell is the structural and physiological unit of the plant, comprising a protoplast and a cell wall. A plant cell can be in the form of an isolated single cell or a cultured cell, or can be part of higher organized unit, for example, a plant tissue, plant organ, or plant. Thus, a plant cell can be a protoplast, a gamete producing cell, or a cell or collection of cells that can regenerate into a whole plant. As such, a seed, which comprises multiple plant cells and is capable of regenerating into a whole plant, is considered plant cell for purposes of this disclosure. A plant tissue or plant organ can be a seed, protoplast, callus, or any other groups of plant cells that is organized into a structural or functional unit. Particularly useful parts of a plant include harvestable parts and parts useful for propagation of progeny plants. A harvestable part of a plant can be any useful part of a plant, for example, flowers, pollen, seedlings, tubers, leaves, stems, fruit, seeds, roots, and the like. A part of a plant useful for propagation includes, for example, seeds, fruits, cuttings, seedlings, tubers, rootstocks, and the like. [00105] A method of producing a heterologous polypeptide or protein complex in a chloroplast or in a transgenic plant of the invention can further include a step of isolating an expressed polypeptide or protein complex from the plant cell chloroplasts. As used herein, the term \"isolated\" or \"substantially purified\" means that a polypeptide or polynucleotide being referred to is in a form that is relatively free of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates or other materials with which it is naturally associated. Generally, an isolated polypeptide (or polynucleotide) constitutes at least twenty percent of a sample, and usually constitutes at least about fifty percent of a sample, particularly at least about eighty percent of a sample, and more particularly about ninety percent or ninety-five percent or more of a sample. [00106] Li one embodiment, an algal extract obtained from an algae cell transformed by replacing an endogenous chloroplast gene via integration of a chimeric construct having a heterologous coding sequence, a promoter sequence, and one or more UTRs, where the promoter is cognate or non-cognate to the endogenous chloroplast gene is disclosed. [00107] The term \"heterologous\" is used herein in a comparative sense to indicate that a nucleotide sequence (or polypeptide) being referred to is from a source other than a reference source, or is linked to a second nucleotide sequence (or polypeptide) with which it is not normally associated, or is modified such that it is in a form that is not normally associated with a reference material. For example, a polynucleotide encoding an antibody is heterologous with respect to a nucleotide sequence of a plant chloroplast, as are the components of a recombinant nucleic acid molecule comprising, for example, a first nucleotide sequence operatively linked to \n\n a second nucleotide sequence, and is a polynucleotide introduced into a chloroplast where the polynucleotide is not normally found in the chloroplast.\n\n\n[00108] The chloroplasts of higher plants and algae likely originated by an endosymbiotic incorporation of a photosynthetic prokaryote into a eukaryotic host. During the integration process genes were transferred from the chloroplast to the host nucleus (Gray, Curr. Opin. Gen. Devel. 9:678-687, 1999). As such, proper photosynthetic function in the chloroplast requires both nuclear encoded proteins and plastid encoded proteins, as well as coordination of gene expression between the two genomes. Expression of nuclear and chloroplast encoded genes in plants is acutely coordinated in response to developmental and environmental factors. [00109] In chloroplasts, regulation of gene expression generally occurs after transcription, and often during translation initiation. This regulation is dependent upon the chloroplast translational apparatus, as well as nuclear-encoded regulatory factors (see Barkan and Goldschmidt-Clermont, Biochemie 82:559-572, 2000; Zerges, Biochemie 82:583-601, 2000; Bruick and Mayfield, supra, 1999). The chloroplast translational apparatus generally resembles that in bacteria; chloroplasts contain 70S ribosomes; have mRNAs that lack 5' caps and generally do not contain 3' poly- adenylated tails (Harris et al., Microbiol. Rev. 58:700-754, 1994); and translation is inhibited in chloroplasts and in bacteria by selective agents such as chloramphenicol. [00110] Several RNA elements that act as mediators of translational regulation have been identified within the 5'UTR's of chloroplast mRNAs (Alexander et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 26:2265-2272, 1998; Hirose and Sugiura, EMBO J. 15:1687-1695, 1996; Mayfield et al., J. Cell Biol. 127:1537-1545, 1994; Sakamoto et al., Plant J. 6:503-512, 1994; Zerges et al., supra, 1997). These elements may interact with nuclear-encoded factors and generally do not resemble known prokaryotic regulatory sequences (McCarthy and Brimacombe, Trends Genet. 10:402- 407, 1994). [00111] A vector or other recombinant nucleic acid molecule of the invention can include a nucleotide sequence encoding a reporter polypeptide or other selectable marker. The term \"reporter\" or selectable marker\" refers to a polynucleotide (or encoded polypeptide) that confers a detectable phenotype. A reporter generally encodes a detectable polypeptide, for example, a green fluorescent protein or an enzyme such as luciferase, which, when contacted with an appropriate agent (a particular wavelength of light or luciferin, respectively) generates a signal that can be detected by eye or using appropriate instrumentation (Giacomin, Plant Sci. 116:59- 72, 1996; Scikantha, J. Bacterid. 178:121, 1996; Gerdes, FEBS Lett. 389:44-47, 1996; see, also, Jefferson, EMBO J. 6:3901-3907, 1997, fl- glucuronidase). A selectable marker generally is a molecule that, when present or expressed in a cell, provides a selective advantage (or \n\n disadvantage) to the cell containing the marker, for example, the ability to grow in the presence of an agent that otherwise would kill the cell.\n\n\n[00112] A selectable marker can provide a means to obtain prokaryotic cells or plant cells or both that express the marker and, therefore, can be useful as a component of a vector of the invention (see, for example, Bock, supra, 2001). Examples of selectable markers include those that confer antimetabolite resistance, for example, dihydrofolate reductase, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Reiss, Plant Physiol. (Life Sci. Adv.) 13:143-149, 1994); neomycin phosphotransferase, which confers resistance to the aminoglycosides neomycin, kanamycin and paromycin (Herrera-Estrella, EMBO J. 2:987-995, 1983), hygromycin phosphotransferase, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Marsh, Gene 32:481-485, 1984), trpB, which allows cells to utilize indole in place of tryptophan; hisD, which allows cells to utilize histinol in place of histidine (Hartman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 85:8047, 1988); mannose-6-phosphate isomerase which allows cells to utilize mannose (WO 94/20627); ornithine decarboxylase, which confers resistance to the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, 2-(difluoromethyl)-DL-ornithine (DFMO; McConlogue, 1987, In: Current Communications in Molecular Biology, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ed.); and deaminase from Aspergillus terreus, which confers resistance to Blasticidin S (Tamura, Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 59:2336-2338, 1995). Additional selectable markers include those that confer herbicide resistance, for example, phosphinothricin acetyltransferase gene, which confers resistance to phosphinothricin (White et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 18:1062, 1990; Spencer et al., Theor. Appl. Genet. 79:625-631, 1990), a mutant EPSP- synthase, which confers glyphosate resistance (Hinchee et al., BioTechnology 91:915-922, 1998), a mutant acetolactate synthase, which confers imidazolione or sulfonylurea resistance (Lee et al., EMBO J. 7:1241-1248, 1988), a mutant psbA, which confers resistance to atrazine, diuron or DCMU (Smeda et al., Plant Physiol. 103:911-917, 1993), or a mutant protoporphyrinogen oxidase (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,373), or other markers conferring resistance to an herbicide such as glufosinate. Selectable markers include polynucleotides that confer dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cells and tetracycline; ampicillin resistance for prokaryotes such as E. coli; and bleomycin, gentamycin, glyphosate, hygromycin, kanamycin, methotrexate, phleomycin, phosphinotricin, spectinomycin, streptomycin, sulfonamide and sulfonylurea resistance in plants (see, for example, Maliga et al., Methods in Plant Molecular Biology, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1995, page 39). Since a composition or a method of the invention can result in expression of a polypeptide in chloroplasts, it can be useful if a polypeptide conferring a selective advantage to a plant cell is operatively linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding a cellular localization motif such that the \n\n polypeptide is translocated to the cytosol, nucleus, or other subcellular organelle where, for example, a toxic effect due to the selectable marker is manifest (see, for example, Von Heijne et al., Plant MoI. Biol. Rep. 9: 104, 1991; Clark et al, J. Biol. Chem. 264:17544, 1989; della Cioppa et al., Plant Physiol. 84:965, 1987; Romer et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 196:1414, 1993; Shah et al., Science 233:478, 1986; Archer et al., J. Bioenerg Biomemb. 22:789, 1990; Scandalios, Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 344:515, 1990; Weisbeek et al., J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 11: 199, 1989; Bruce, Trends Cell Biol. 10:440, 2000.\n\n\n[00113] The ability to passage a shuttle vector of the invention in a prokaryote allows for conveniently manipulating the vector. For example, a reaction mixture containing the vector and putative inserted polynucleotides of interest can be transformed into prokaryote host cells such as E. coli, amplified and collected using routine methods, and examined to identify vectors containing an insert or construct of interest. If desired, the vector can be further manipulated, for example, by performing site directed mutagenesis of the inserted polynucleotide, then again amplifying and selecting vectors having a mutated polynucleotide of interest. The shuttle vector then can be introduced into plant cell chloroplasts, wherein a polypeptide of interest can be expressed and, if desired, isolated according to a method of the invention. [00114] A polynucleotide or recombinant nucleic acid molecule of the invention, which can be contained in a vector, including a vector of the invention, can be introduced into plant chloroplasts using any method known in the art. As used herein, the term \"introducing\" means transferring a polynucleotide into a cell, including a prokaryote or a plant cell, particularly a plant cell plastid. A polynucleotide can be introduced into a cell by a variety of methods, which are well known in the art and selected, in part, based on the particular host cell. For example, the polynucleotide can be introduced into a plant cell using a direct gene transfer method such as electroporation or microprojectile mediated (biolistic) transformation using a particle gun, or the \"glass bead method\" (see, for example, Kindle et al., supra, 1991), vortexing in the presence of DNA-coated microfibers (Dunahay, Biotechniques, 15(3):452-458, 1993), or by liposome- mediated transformation, transformation using wounded or enzyme-degraded immature embryos (see Potrykus, Ann. Rev. Plant. Physiol. Plant MoI. Biol. 42:205-225, 1991). [00115] Plastid transformation is a routine and well known method for introducing a polynucleotide into aplant cell chloroplast (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,451,513, 5,545,817, and\n\n\n5,545,818; WO 95/16783; McBride et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 91:7301-7305, 1994). Chloroplast transformation involves introducing regions of chloroplast DNA flanking a desired nucleotide sequence into a suitable target tissue; using, for example, a biolistic or protoplast transformation method (e.g., calcium chloride or PEG mediated transformation). Fifty bp to three \n\n kb flanking nucleotide sequences of chloroplast genomic DNA allow homologous recombination of the vector with the chloroplast genome, and allow the replacement or modification of specific regions of the plastid genome. Using this method, point mutations in the chloroplast 16S rRNA and rpsl2 genes, which confer resistance to spectinomycin or streptomycin, can be utilized as selectable markers for transformation (Newman et al., Genetics 126:875-888, 1990; Svab et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 87:8526-8530, 1990; Staub and Maliga, supra, 1992), and can result in stable homoplasmic transformants, at a frequency of approximately one per 100 bombardments of target tissues. The presence of cloning sites between these markers provides a convenient nucleotide sequence for making a chloroplast vector (Staub and Maliga, EMBO J. 12:601-606, 1993), including a vector of the invention. Substantial increases in transformation frequency are obtained by replacement of the recessive rRNA or r-protein antibiotic resistance genes with a dominant selectable marker, the bacterial aadA gene encoding the spectinomycin- detoxifying enzyme aminoglycoside-3'-adenyltransferase (Goldschmidt-Clermont, Nucleic Acids Res 19:4083-4389, 1991; Svab and Maliga, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 90:913-917, 1993). Approximately 15 to 20 cell division cycles following transformation are generally required to reach a homoplasmic state. Plastid expression, in which genes are inserted by homologous recombination into all of the up to several thousand copies of the circular plastid genome present in each plant cell, takes advantage of the enormous copy number advantage over nuclear- expressed genes to permit expression levels that can readily exceed 10% of the total soluble plant protein.\n\n\n[00116] A direct gene transfer method such as electroporation also can be used to introduce a polynucleotide of the invention into a plant protoplast (Fromm et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 82:5824, 1985). Electrical impulses of high field strength reversibly permeabilize membranes allowing the introduction of the polynucleotide. Microinjection can be performed as described in Potrykus and Spangenberg (eds.), Gene Transfer To Plants (Springer Verlag, Berlin, NY 1995). A transformed plant cell containing the introduced polynucleotide can be identified by detecting a phenotype due to the introduced polynucleotide, for example, expression of a reporter gene or a selectable marker. [00117] Microprojectile mediated transformation also can be used to introduce a polynucleotide into a plant cell chloroplast (Klein et al., Nature 327:70-73, 1987). This method utilizes microprojectiles such as gold or tungsten, which are coated with the desired polynucleotide by precipitation with calcium chloride, spermidine or polyethylene glycol. The microprojectile particles are accelerated at high speed into a plant tissue using a device such as the BIOLISTIC PD-1000 particle gun (BioRad; Hercules Calif). Methods for the transformation \n\n using biolistic methods are well known (Wan, Plant Physiol. 104:37-48, 1984; Vasil, BioTechnology 11: 1553-1558, 1993; Christou, Trends in Plant Science 1:423-431, 1996). Microprojectile mediated transformation has been used, for example, to generate a variety of transgenic plant species, including cotton, tobacco, corn, hybrid poplar and papaya. Important cereal crops such as wheat, oat, barley, sorghum and rice also have been transformed using microprojectile mediated delivery (Duan et al., Nature Biotech. 14:494-498, 1996; Shimamoto, Curr. Opin. Biotech. 5:158-162, 1994). The transformation of most dicotyledonous plants is possible with the methods described above. Transformation of monocotyledonous plants also can be transformed using, for example, biolistic methods as described above, protoplast transformation, electroporation of partially permeabilized cells, introduction of DNA using glass fibers, the glass bead agitation method (Kindle et al., supra, 1991), and the like. [00118] Reporter genes have been successfully used in chloroplasts of higher plants, and high levels of recombinant protein expression have been reported. In addition, reporter genes have been used in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii, but, in most cases very low amounts of protein were produced. Reporter genes greatly enhance the ability to monitor gene expression in a number of biological organisms. In chloroplasts of higher plants, beta-glucuronidase (uidA, Staub and Maliga, EMBO J. 12:601-606, 1993), neomycin phosphotransferase (nptll, Carrer et al., MoI. Gen. Genet. 241:49-56, 1993), adenosyl-3-adenyltransferase (aadA, Svab and Maliga, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 90:913-917, 1993), and the Aequorea victoria GFP (Sidorov et al., Plant J. 19:209-216, 1999) have been used as reporter genes (Heifetz, Biochemie 82:655-666, 2000). Each of these genes has attributes that make them useful reporters of chloroplast gene expression, such as ease of analysis, sensitivity, or the ability to examine expression in situ. [00119] An Fc-fusion protein of the present invention may be used as a medicament to treat a subject, in need thereof, by administering an effective concentration of the protein in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Typically, the compositions are formulated for single dosage administration [00122] Upon mixing or addition of the compound(s), the resulting mixture maybe a solution, suspension, emulsion or the like. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle.

The active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable earner in an amount sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in the absence of undesirable side effects on the patient treated. In one aspect, treated may be performed by contacting cells with the fusion protein of the invention ex vivo.\n\n\n[0125] The therapeutically effective concentration may be determined empincally by testing the compounds in known in vitro and in vivo systems as descnbed herein or known to those of skill m this art and then extrapolated therefrom for dosages for humans. \n\n [0126] The concentration of active compound in the drug composition will depend on absorption, inactivation and excretion rates of the active compound, the dosage schedule, and amount administered as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. [0127J The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the disease being treated and may be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values may also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated.

The active materials can also be mixed with other active materials which do not impair the desired action, or with materials that supplement the desired action.\n\n\n[0126] The following examples are intended to illustrate but not limit the invention.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nMaterials and Methods.\n\n\nSynthesis of antibody and construction of Fc-fusion proteins.\n\n\n[0127] Coding regions for all recombinant proteins were synthesized de novo in C. reinhardtii chloroplast codon bias (Franklin et al. Plant J (2002) 30:733-744, Mayfield et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2003) 100:438-442, Mayfield et al., Plant J (2004) 37:449-458) using PCR based oligonucleotide gene assembly (Stemmer et al., Gene (1995) 164:49-53).\n\n\n[0128] As a means to achieve higher levels of recombinant protein accumulation the question of codon bias in the chloroplast was specifically addressed. Using a codon optimized gfp gene, accumulation of codon optimized GFP increased 80 fold as compared to a non-optimized GFP counterpart was demonstrated (Franklin et. al., 2002). The chloroplast codon optimized GFP, driven by the rbcL promoter and 5' UTR, accumulated to 0.5% of total soluble protein. More recently, a chloroplast codon optimized LuxAB gene, luxCt, has been developed (Mayfield and Schultz, 2003) that allows for in situ visualization of recombinant protein accumulation. Collectively, these data established that algal chloroplasts have the capacity to synthesize fairly complex molecules in a soluble and active form. [0129] The high levels of expression of the codon optimized gfpCt and luxCt genes lead to examination of high levels of human antibody expression in eukaryotic algae through codon optimization of human antibody genes. Because of the complexity of engineering a strain to express both a heavy and light chain gene simultaneously, an antibody gene was designed that could be expressed as a single coding region, but one that was more complex then a simple scFv \n\n antibody. For this, a large single chain anti Herpes Simplex virus antibody gene was engineered, HSV8, in C. reinhardtii chloroplast codon bias. This large single chain (lsc) antibody contained the entire IgA heavy chain fused to the variable region of the light chain by a flexible linker. This gene was designed to examine both expression and assembly, as this lsc antibody contains the Fc portion of the heavy chain, which is the site normally involved in mtermolecular disulfide bond formation leading to dimerization of the antibody. C reinhardtii chloroplast atpA or rbcL promoters and 5' untranslated regions were used to drive expression\n\n\n[0130] The HSV8 antibody is directed against Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D (Burioni et al 1994), and as shown in Figure 4, expression of the HSV8-lsc antibody in E coli results in the accumulation of protein mainly in the insoluble pellet. The small amount of HSV8-lsc that accumulates in the soluble phase of E coli was unable to bind antigen. Expression of the HSV8- lsc protein m C reinhardtii chloroplast results in the accumulation of a completely soluble protein, with no antibody found in the insoluble pellet (Figure 4, central panel) The chloroplast expressed HSV8-lsc antibody was found to bind herpes virus proteins, as determined by ELISA assays, while no binding was detected from the E coli expressed protein. The chloroplast expressed antibody was also found to assemble into higher order complexes that were susceptible to reduction by βME (Figure 4, right panel), suggesting that the chloroplast expressed antibody is assembling into dimers of the correct size (ca 130 kDa) in vivo Formation of disulfide bonds in recombinant proteins expressed in chloroplast has previously been shown for human somatotropin expressed in tobacco chloroplast (Staub et al 2000), and was somewhat expected given the presence of protein disulfide isomerase in algal chloroplasts (Kim and Mayfield 1997, Mayfield et al 2003).\n\n\n[0131] In addition to expressing the large single chain antibody, a conventional single chain antibody containing only the variable regions of the light and heavy chains fused together (scFv) was also expressed. As shown in Figure 5 (left panel), the scFv accumulated in chloroplast in the soluble phase, and appears to be somewhat more stable than the HSV8-lsc protein. To test for binding activity the scFv was used in ELISA assays against HSV proteins. As shown in Figure 5 (right panel) the scFv was able to bind HSV proteins, even from crude cell extracts without purification, demonstrating that the protein was correctly folded into a functional antigen binding protein.\n\n\n[0132] As shown in Figure 6, expression of full length light chain and heavy chain proteins from a human IgA antibody has been achieved, hi addition, a dual promoter-UTR cassette based upon the endogenous rbcL and atpA genes that allows for linked integration and simultaneous expression of two copies of a recombinant gene has been developed. As shown in Figure 6A, the \n\n rbcL and atpA genes are transcribed from adjacent divergent promoters in the C. reinhardtii chloroplast genome and both promoters are contained within a segment of DNA spanning 863 bp. This divergent promoter has the advantage in that one need only select for a single integration event in order to integrate two copies of a gene. For expression of heavy chain and light chain, the HC and LC HSV8 genes, divergent promoter and 3' UTR were ligated so that four separate constructs were made, with both genes being driven by each promoter in both possible orientations. Each of these constructs was placed into the p3HB chloroplast expression cassette. This cassette was developed to allow for integration events into a C. reinhardtii strain, psbHΔ, in which the psbH gene was disrupted through the introduction of a single nucleotide resulting in a frame shift. The introduction of the mutation was selected for by the inclusion of the adjacent aphA6 cassette conferring resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin (Bateman and Purton, 2000). Introduction of recombinant genes into strain psbHΔ, results in elimination of the apfiAό cassette and conversion of the mutated psbH gene to wild type with conversion to phototrophy. Hence, transformants are selected for based upon their ability to grow on minimal media. Constructs 7 and 9 both contain the light chain gene driven by the rbcL promoter-UTR and the heavy chain gene driven by the atpA promoter-UTR. Each coding region is followed by the rbcL 3' UTR. Construct 7 is oriented such that the LC gene is in the reverse orientation with respect to the endogenous psbH gene, while in construct 9 it is in the forward orientation. [0133] Constructs 8 and 31 contain the light chain gene driven by the atpA promoter-UTR and heavy chain gene driven by the rbcL promoter-UTR, again, each coding region is followed by the rbcL 3' UTR. All four constructs were transformed into a psbH deletion strain and selected for growth on minimal media. As shown in Figure 6 B, independent isolates of all four transgenic lines accumulate both the 27 kDa light chain protein and a 53 kDa heavy chain protein. Both heavy chain and light chain proteins accumulate well, and appear to be in stoichiometric amounts. These data thus demonstrate the utility of the divergent promoter for the simultaneous expression of two gene products, and show that chloroplasts accumulate full-length human antibody proteins as soluble proteins. This divergent promoter is used to increase expression levels of the IgE receptor and receptor fusion proteins. [0134] In addition, as seen in Figure 7, FLAG affinity purified IgAs from strain 9-4-4 assemble into full length mAbs as visualized by SDS PAGE in the absence of βME. These mAbs were also shown to function in ELISA assays.\n\n\n[0135] For the three examples presented above, HSV8 scfv, large single chain and the full-length IgA, the expression levels range from 0.2% of total soluble protein for the scfv molecule to 0.5% for the large single chain molecule. To put these numbers into perspective, see Table 2, below. \n\n In this table a loss of 50% of the recombinant protein on purification from crude extracts was assumed.\n\n\n[0136] Table 2 showing the accumulation of soluble protein relative to biomass in cells grown at laboratory scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumbers assume a cell density of 1.0 x 10 cell ml\n\"\n . For large scale cultures (in excess of 400L) cell counts and hence biomass and soluble protein, generally are 50% of the values shown here. These latter values were used in calculating yield data discussed for a large scale facility.\n\n\n[0137] cDNAs encoding the ecFcεRIα alone, excluding the ER targeting sequence, with and without a FLAG epitope at the C-terminus and as a fusion with human IgGl hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains (either with or without a FLAG epitope at the C-terminus of the IgGl moiety) are synthesized in C. reinhardtii chloroplast codon bias utilizing a PCR-based approach (Stemmer et. al., 1995) as previously described (Franklin et. al., 2002). The cDNA sequence of human ecFcεRIα is based on Gen Bank Accession no. X06948 and excludes the transmembrane spanning domain and cytoplasmic tail. The nucleotide sequence spans residues 182 to 718 resulting in a peptide 180 aa in length. [0138] Although epitope tags such as FLAG can greatly aid in protein purification, such epitope tagged molecules are not considered pharmacologically acceptable for use in animals or humans. Epitope tags do, however, facilitate rapid and highly sensitive detection and quantification of recombinant protein accumulation levels with which to aid in following the molecules as they are expressed in situ. \n\n [0139] C. reinhardtii chloroplast codon optimized Flag tagged and native ecFcεRIα and its fusion with hlgGl, both Flag tagged and native, are synthesized with Nde I and Xba I restriction sites at the 5' and 3' ends respectively. Gene assembled products are first cloned into pCR Topo 2.1 vectors to confirm that the assembled products are of the correct sequence. Any point mutations are repaired using site-directed mutagenesis. Constructs having the correct nucleotide sequence are then cloned directly into the chloroplast transformation construct p322 (Franklin et. al., 2002), as a Bam HI restriction fragment when furnished with the appropriate 5'promoter/UTR and 3'UTR as illustrated in Figure 8 A. At the same time, constructs with the correct sequence can be cloned into pBAD/glll (Invitrogen) which has been modified to accept Nde I/Xba I inserts for soluble expression in E. coli.\n\n\n[0140] Accumulation of various recombinant proteins in the C. reinhardtii chloroplast is greatly affected by the choice of 5' promoter/UTR and less so by the 3' UTR. Thus, for the expression of ecFcεRIα and its fusion with hlgGl, all of the 5' promoter /UTRs listed in Figure 8A are tested. [0141] Transformation of C. reinhardtii chloroplast with p322 constructs is carried out in strain 137 c+ via co-transformation with plasmid p228 which confers spectinomycin resistance by virtue of a point mutation in the 16S rRNA gene (Franklin et. al., 2002). Positive transformants are selected on TAP media plus spectinomycin (Harris, 1989) and subjected to two or more rounds of streaking on selective media to obtain homoplasmic lines as determined by Southern blot analysis. Purification of FLAG-tagged ecFcεRIα -hlgGl and ecFcεRIα from C. reinhardtii expressing strains is carried out by anti-FLAG affinity chromatography as described (Mayfield and Franklin 2003). Purification of the non-epitope, Flag tagged receptor-IgGl fusion and non- epitope tagged soluble receptor, is carried out using Protein A chromatography. [0142] Integration of constructs at the p322 site results in two copies of the insert per chloroplast genome, as this region lies in the duplicated inverted repeat region. Additionally, a divergent promoter/5 'UTR cassette shown in Figure 7B is provided. This construct may integrate up to six copies of either ecFcεRIα or its fusion with hlgGl per chloroplast genome by co -transforming the divergent promoter/5 'UTR cassette into &psbHA strain (Fig. 6) at both the p322 site (selection provided by co-transformation with spectinomycin resistance plasmid, p228) and the psbH site (selection provided by rescue of the /w&H gene and ability to grow on acetate free medium).\n\n\n[0143] hlgE is used as a substrate in ELISAs, as a purification reagent for recombinantly expressed ecFcεRIα and as a reagent in cell based assays. The human IgE (hlgE) JW8, specific for the hapten 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NIP), is purified from the transfectoma JW8/5/13 \n\n (European Cell Culture Collection, ref. no. 87080706) as described by Nechansky et al. (2001) over a NIP-BSA column. JW8/5/13 is propagated by conventional methods and JW8 is purified over NIP-BSA affinity matrices. JW8 purified in this fashion serves as a substrate in ELISAs to assess the binding of receptor and receptor mAb fusions to IgE. [0144] In addition, an ecFcεRIα affinity column is optionally constructed using purified JW8. JW8 purified as described above, is coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated sepharose. This affinity column is then used to purify ecFcεRIα expressed in both C. reinhardtii and E. coli. As such, the column also serves to assess the activity of the receptor produced in these systems. [0145] Functional ecFcεRIα has been expressed in the periplasm of E. coli (Robertson, 1993), and this approach is followed to generate a control molecule with which to compare C. reinhardtii produced ecFcεRIα. E. coli expressed ecFcεRIα is purified using the ecFcεRIα affinity column described above.\n\n\n[0146] ELISA detection assays are carried out using standard techniques (Harlowe and Lane, 1988) to assess the affinity of E. coli expressed ecFcεRIα vs the C. reinhardtii expressed counterpart for JW8 antibody. Similarly, the affinity of functional (as judged by ELISA) ecFcεRIα -IgGl (expressed in either the mammalian or E. coli system) for JW8, can be assessed vs. the C. reinhardtii expressed counterpart.\n\n\n[0147] While ELISA assays confirm that ecFcεRIα and ecFcεRIα -IgGl expressed in C. reinhardtii are capable of binding JW8 (hlgE), the assay does not confirm that these molecules are interacting in a manner that would specifically block hlgE interaction with ecFcεRIα displayed on the surface of a cell. In order to address this point, experiments are carried out essentially as described by Wilson et al. (1993) and Nechansky et al. (2001). Briefly, rat basophil cell line RBL-2H3 are transfected with full length FcεRIα (not simply the extracellular domain). This cell line, expressing FcεRIα, has demonstrated its ability to support IgE mediated target cell exocytosis and expression of mast cell mediators and granule components such as hexosaminidase. Transfected RBL-2H3 cells incubated with varying concentrations of JW8 are triggered with NIP-BSA as described, and levels of secreted vs total available hexosaminidase are calculated. The ability of C. reinhardtii expressed ecFcεRIα or ecFcεRIα -IgGl to inhibit the IgE mediated release of hexosaminidase in this assay is indicative of the recombinant receptor or receptor IgG fusion's ability to interact precisely with the FcεRIα binding site on the Fc portion of hlgE. Positive controls are E. coli expressed ecFcεRIα and mammalian or E. coli expressed ecFcεRIα-IgGl. Example 1: Expression of Fc-Fusion Proteins \n\n [0148] A mammalian soluble receptor was fused to the hinge, C\nH\n2 and C\nH\n3 domains of a human IgGl molecule. The exact nature of the amino acid sequence at the receptor-Fc junction is somewhat important, as many workers have observed that not all native sequences will lead to expression/accumulation of the molecule. Often times, the precise amino acid sequence in this region must be optimized to obtain a molecule which is stable and soluble, in vivo. This construct, codon optimized for expression in the C. reinhardtii chloroplast, was then cloned downstream of the strong 16sG promoter/atpA 5' UTR (\\6sGlatpA) or ύiepsbA promoter/ 5' UTR (psbA) for expression in C. reinhardtii chloroplasts. l6sG/otpA driven cassettes were introduced into the p321 vector for integration in the inverted repeat region of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast genome, while psbA driven cassettes were introduced into the ChI B region in a construct which completely ablates this non-essential gene. Using particle gun mediated transformation, each of the above cassettes was independently co-transformed with plasmid p228 (which confers resistance to spectinomycin) into the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii. Selection was carried out onTAP medium containing spectinomycin. Homoplasmic lines were generated and large scale cultures were grown to assess Fc receptor fusion purification using standard protein A or protein G affinity matrices. Data are shown below for the 16sGfatpA line purified via Protein A (Protein G affinity matrices were also demonstrated to work comparably, as was purification of receptor Fc fusion when expressed from the psbA driven cassette. [0149] Transplastomic algae expressing the Fc-fusion protein were grown in photo-bioreactors in TAP medium in continuous batch mode. Cells were harvested via TFF followed by centrifugation and biomass was frozen at -80\n0\nC until further use. Cells were re-suspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris'Cl, pH 7.4, 130 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, ImM PMSF, 0.1% Tween 20) with stirring. Cells were cracked at 16,000 psi in a micro fluiidizer (Microfluidics, Inc.) followed by centrifugation at 4°C and 30,000 x g for 30 min. The recovered supernatant was then subjected to filtration over a 0.8 micron dead end filter (Nalgene, Inc.). Supernatant containing the Fc-fusion was then incubated with Protein A agarose for 4-12 hours with mixing. Protein A, with bound Fc-fusion protein, was subjected to column chromatography. Resin was washed with 30 column volumes of lysis buffer. Chloroplast expressed Fc-fusion protein was eluted from Protein A with 17 column volumes of 0.2M glycine*HCl, pH 2.5 into tubes conatining IM Tris'Cl, pH 9.0. Samples were then concentrated over Amicon Ultra filter devices (10,000 MW) and analyzed as shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n[0150] Data from eight independent harvests from a transgenic line expressing an Fc-receptor fusion protein is shown in Table 3. Table 3. Yield of receptor-Fc fusion protein purified via chromatography over Protein A agarose \n\n (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0151] Accumulation was assessed by western blot analysis of crude lysates versus reference standard. Total soluble protein in lysate was quantified using Bradford assay (BioRad). Yield was estimated by comparing Protein A purified material to BSA standard on a coomassie stained gel. Percent yield was calculated by dividing amount of Fc-fusion captured (Yield) by (Accumulation x Total Sol. Protein).\n\n\nExample 2: Receptor-Fc Fusions a. IL- 17 Receptor Fc Fusion\n\n\n[0152] Secreted by CD4 T cells, IL- 17 is a cytokine that shows markedly elevated levels in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. IL-17 is clearly involved in the inflammatory pathway in ways similar to tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Controlling IL-17 levels through its sequestration by a soluble receptor-Fc fusion, is one approach to mitigating its pro-inflammatory properties. Possible indications where such molecules might show efficacy are RA, Crohn's disease and Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\n\n[0153] The amino acids delimiting the extracellular domain of IL-17 receptor may be determined from the GenBank database, for example, for Gen Bank Ace. No. Q9NRM6, the extracellular domain comprises amino acids 18-292. A chloroplast biased nucleotide sequence is generated which encodes extracellular domain (see Franklin et al. Plant J (2002) 30:733-744, Mayfield et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2003) 100:438-442, Mayfield et al., Plant J (2004) 37:449-458) using PCR based oligonucleotide gene assembly (Stemmer et al., Gene (1995) 164:49-53). Once assembled, the sequence will be linked the hinge, C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3 domains of heavy chain hlgGl using \n\n an in frame amino acid linker (low complexity) located between the carboxy terminus of the ECD of the receptor and amino terminus of the Fc region. The fusion protein may be purified by Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography. b. Receptor for TNF alpha-Fc Fusion\n\n\n[0154] Tumor necrosis factor is a critical mediator in the inflammatory response, up-regulating the expression of adhesion molecules, and promoting neutrophil and eosinophil migration to sites of inflammation. Mitigating these effects through neutralization of TNF has become a key strategy in combating diseases such as RA., both through the use of mAbs which prevent TNF interaction with its receptor and TNF a-Fc fusions, which again, act as ligand traps for TNF. [0155] The amino acids delimiting the extracellular domain of TNF alpha receptor may be determined from the GenBank database, for example, for Gen Bank Ace. No. P20333, the extracellular domain comprises amino acids 23-257. A chloroplast biased nucleotide sequence is generated which encodes extracellular domain (see Franklin et al. Plant J (2002) 30:733-744, Mayfield et al., Proc Natl Acad Sd USA (2003) 100:438-442, Mayfield et al., Plant J (2004) 37:449-458) using PCR based oligonucleotide gene assembly (Stemmer et al., Gene (1995) 164:49-53). Once assembled, the sequence will be linked the hinge, C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3 domains of heavy chain MgGl using an in frame amino acid linker (low complexity) located between the carboxy terminus of the ECD of the receptor and amino terminus of the Fc region. Again, the fusion protein may be purified by Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography. c. High Affinity IgE Receptor (FcεRIα)-Fc fusions.\n\n\n[0156] The Fc portion of circulating IgE normally interacts with FcεRIα, the high affinity receptor for IgE on the surface of mast cells and basophils. By preventing FcεRIα /IgE interaction and subsequent crosslinking of receptors, the FcεRIα -Fc fusion limits the production of inflammatory mediators produced by these cells (i.e. histamine, leukotrienes, protaglandins etc.).\n\n\n[0157] The soluble domain of the high affinity receptor for IgE antibodies was fused to the hinge, C\nR\n2 and C\nH\n3 domains of a human IgGl molecule (Figure 2). The exact nature of the amino acid sequence at the receptor-Fc junction is somewhat important, as many workers have observed that not all native sequences will lead to expression/accumulation of the molecule. Often times, the precise amino acid sequence must be optimized to obtain a molecule that is stable and soluble, in vivo. Hence, multiple forms of such a receptor-Fc fusion might be envisioned where the precise amino acid sequence at the receptor-hinge junction could be altered \n\n to improve solubility/folding characteristics of the molecule. This construct, codon optimized for expression in the C. reinhardtii chloroplast, was then cloned downstream of either the strong 16sA promoter/atpA 5' UTR (16sA/atpA), the atpA promoter/5 'UTR (atpA), the 16sA promoter/rpsl8 5'UTR (16sA/rpsl8) or the psbD promoter/5 'UTR (psbD) for expression in C. reinhardtii chloroplasts. Each of these cassettes were introduced into the p321 vector for integration in the inverted repeat region of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast genome. Using particle gun mediated transformation, each of the above cassettes was independently co-transformed with plasmid p228 (which confers resistance to spectinomycin) into the chloroplast of C reinhardtii with selection carried out on TAP/Spec medium. Homoplasmic lines were generated and large scale cultures were grown to assess our ability to purify this Fc receptor fusion using standard protein A affinity matrices. Data below (Figure 9) are only from the psbD line, but all lines generated showed similar purification of the receptor-Fc fusion.\n\n\n[0158] Frozen C. reinhardtii biomass was resuspended in TBST-pH7.4 plus ImM PMSF. Cells were cracked using a sonicator. Samples were subjected to centrifugation to pellet debris.. The clarified lysate was incubated with Protein-A agarose (Upstate) resin overnight at 4 \n0\nC with mixing. The following day, Protein A agarose with bound alga expressed mAb was packaged into chromatography columns (BioRad Polyprep). The flow through was collected and analyzed. Columns were washed with 30 column volumes of TBST pH7.4 and the wash fractions collected for analysis. Recombinant alga mAb was eluted from Protein A using 0.2M glycine HCl, pH2.5 and the solution immediately neutralized via addition of IM Tris»Cl, pH9.0. The antibody solution was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 10,000 MWCO concentrator. Samples were run on 4-20% Tris Glycine gels, transferred to nitrocellulose and the membrane incubated with an murine anti-FLAG mAb followed by goat anti-mouse AP conjugated secondary polyclonal sera. Blots were developed with NBT/BCIP (Figure 9).\n\n\nd. Low Affinity IgE Receptor(FcεRII/CD23)-Fc fusion.\n\n\n[0159] Like FcεRI, FcεRII/CD23, is expressed on the surface of activated lung alveolar macrophages, monocytes and B cells of atopic individuals. Activation of the receptor on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs) leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while its activation on B cells leads to increased synthesis of IgE as well as antigen presentation. Again, controlling circulating levels of IgE via such a receptor-Fc fusion has the potential to ameliorate allergic diseases including types of asthma. \n\n [0160] The amino acids delimiting the extracellular domain of Low Affinity IgE receptor may be determined from the GenBank database, for example, for Gen Bank Ace. No. P06734, the extracellular domain comprises amino acids 48-321. A chloroplast biased nucleotide sequence is generated which encodes extracellular domain (see Franklin et al. Plant J (2002) 30:733-744, Mayfield et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2003) 100:438-442, Mayfield et al., Plant J (2004) 37:449-458) using PCR based oligonucleotide gene assembly (Stemmer et al., Gene (1995) 164:49-53). Once assembled, the sequence will be linked the hinge, C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3 domains of heavy chain hlgGl using an in frame amino acid linker (low complexity) located between the carboxy terminus of the ECD of the receptor and amino terminus of the Fc region. Again, the fusion protein may be purified by Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography. e. α Chain High Affinity Receptor for IL-4-Fc fusion\n\n\n[0161] The cytokine Interleukin 4 is involved in isotype switching in B cells and also in the production of IgE. The α chain high affinity receptor for IL-4, fused to Fc has the potential to be used as a ligand trap for this cytokine and might find application in treating diseases such as asthma.\n\n\n[0162] The amino acids delimiting the extracellular domain of α Chain High Affinity Receptor for IL-4 may be determined from the GenBank database, for example, for Gen Bank Ace. No. P24394, the extracellular domain comprises amino acids 26-232. A chloroplast biased nucleotide sequence is generated which encodes extracellular domain (see Franklin et al. Plant J (2002) 30:733-744, Mayfield et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2003) 100:438-442, Mayfield et al., Plant J (2004) 37:449-458) using PCR based oligonucleotide gene assembly (Stemmer et al., Gene (1995) 164:49-53). Once assembled, the sequence will be linked the hinge, C\nH\n2-CH3 domains of heavy chain hlgGl using an in frame amino acid linker (low complexity) located between the carboxy terminus of the ECD of the receptor and amino terminus of the Fc region. Again, the fusion protein may be purified by Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography. f. Receptor for IL-5-Fc fusion\n\n\n[0163] Interleukin 5 promotes the recruitment, survival and activation of eosinophils. Again, such receptor-Fc fusions might find application in diseases such as asthma or hypereosinophilia syndromes.\n\n\n[0164] The amino acids delimiting the extracellular domain of IL- 5 receptor may be determined from the GenBank database, for example, for Gen Bank Ace. No. P24394, the extracellular domain comprises amino acids 26-232. A chloroplast biased nucleotide sequence is generated \n\n which encodes extracellular domain (see Franklin et al. Plant J (2002) 30:733-744, Mayfield et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2003) 100:438-442, Mayfield et al., Plant J (2004) 37:449-458) using PCR based oligonucleotide gene assembly (Stemmer et al., Gene (1995) 164:49-53). Once assembled, the sequence will be linked the hinge, C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3 domains of heavy chain MgGl using an in frame amino acid linker (low complexity) located between the carboxy terminus of the ECD of the receptor and amino terminus of the Fc region. Again, the fusion protein may be purified by Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography, g. Receptor for IL- 13-Fc fusion\n\n\n[0165] Interleukin 13 has been demonstrated to play a key role in airway hyper-responsiveness, thus it is a promising target for the treatment of asthma. Fusion of the high affinity receptor for IL-13 (IL13-αR) to hlgGl Fc domains would provide a means to block the effects of this cytokine. [0166] The amino acids delimiting the extracellular domain of IL-13 receptor may be determined from the GenBank database, for example, for Gen Bank Ace. No. CAA70021, the extracellular domain comprises amino acids 27-343. A chloroplast biased nucleotide sequence is generated which encodes extracellular domain (see Franklin et al. Plant J (2002) 30:733-744, Mayfield et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2003) 100:438-442, Mayfield et al., Plant J (2004) 37:449-458) using PCR based oligonucleotide gene assembly (Stemmer et al., Gene (1995) 164:49-53). Once assembled, the sequence will be linked the hinge, C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3 domains of heavy chain hlgGl using an in frame amino acid linker (low complexity) located between the carboxy terminus of the ECD of the receptor and amino terminus of the Fc region. Again, the fusion protein may be purified by Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography, h. Receptor for IL-2 (α subunit/CD25)-Fc Fusion\n\n\n[0167] Interleukin 2 is yet another cytokine involved in the proinflamatory response cascade. Interaction of IL-2 with its high affinity receptor heightens T cell responses and promotes secretion of IL-4, 5 and 13. CD25-Fc fusions might find applications in allergic disease as well as suppression of T-cell responses in transplantation, for which the anti-CD25 mAb, Daclizumab, is already prescribed.\n\n\n[0168] The amino acids delimiting the extracellular domain of IL-2 receptor alpha subunit may be determined from the GenBank database, for example, for Gen Bank Ace. No. NP 000408, the extracellular domain comprises amino acids 22-236. A chloroplast biased nucleotide sequence is generated which encodes extracellular domain (see Franklin et al. Plant J (2002) 30:733-744, \n\n Mayfield et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2003) 100:438-442, Mayfield et al., Plant J (2004) 37:449-458) using PCR based oligonucleotide gene assembly (Stemmer et al., Gene (1995) 164:49-53). Once assembled, the sequence will be linked the hinge, C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3 domains of heavy chain hlgGl using an in frame amino acid linker (low complexity) located between the carboxy terminus of the ECD of the receptor and amino terminus of the Fc region. Again, the fusion protein may be purified by Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography, i, Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte- Associated Antigen-4 (CTLA)-4-Fc Fusion\n\n\n[0169] CD 28 on T cells interacts with both CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) on APCs. The interaction of CD28 with these molecules results in T cell proliferation, and cytokine release which in turn elicits macrophage and dendritic cell migration to the sites of inflammation. CTLA-4 is also expressed on T cells, and is a much higher affinity binder for CD80 and CD86. CTLA-4-Fc fusions can therefore block CD28 interactions with these molecules, preventing the inflammatory cascade described above. [0170] The amino acids delimiting the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 may be determined from the GenBank database, for example, for Gen Bank Ace. No. NP OOl 0032720, the extracellular domain comprises amino acids 36-161. A chloroplast biased nucleotide sequence is generated which encodes extracellular domain (see Franklin et al. Plant J (2002) 30:733-744, Mayfield et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2003) 100:438-442, Mayfield et al., Plant J (2004) 37:449-458) using PCR based oligonucleotide gene assembly (Stemmer et al., Gene (1995) 164:49-53). Once assembled, the sequence will be linked the hinge, C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3 domains of heavy chain MgGl using an in frame amino acid linker (low complexity) located between the carboxy terminus of the ECD of the receptor and amino terminus of the Fc region. Again, the fusion protein may be purified by Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography. j . Receptor for RANK (Receptor activator of nuclear factor κβ)-Fc Fusion\n\n\n[0171] RANK, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, interacts with its cognate ligand RANKL. RANKL (also known as osteoclast differentiation factor) is responsible, through binding to RANK, for osteoclastogenesis. Blocking the RANK/RANKL interaction should limit osteoclastogenesis and hence bone resorption in general. Such an approach might have great therapeutic value in anti-resorptive therapeutic regimens, such as tumor induced hypercalcemia. [0172] The amino acids delimiting the extracellular domain of RANK may be determined from the GenBank database, for example, for Gen Bank Ace. No. QY606, the extracellular domain comprises amino acids 30-212. A chloroplast biased nucleotide sequence is generated which \n\n encodes extracellular domain (see Franklin et al. Plant J (2002) 30:733-744, Mayfϊeld et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2003) 100:438-442, Mayfield et al., Plant J (2004) 37:449-458) using PCR based oligonucleotide gene assembly (Stemmer et al., Gene (1995) 164:49-53). Once assembled, the sequence will be linked the hinge, C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3 domains of heavy chain MgGl using an in frame amino acid linker (low complexity) located between the carboxy terminus of the ECD of the receptor and amino terminus of the Fc region. Again, the fusion protein may be purified by Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography. Example 3 : Non-Receptor-Fc Fusions a. Factor- VII Fc Fusion (ICON)\n\n\n[0173] Factor- VII is the natural ligand for the transmembrane receptor known as tissue factor. Tissue factor is selectively expressed on proliferating endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature and not in normal tissues. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the cause of irreversible blindness in elderly population. In order to reduce the rate of visual loss in patients with AMD, minimizing sub-retinal choroidal neo-vascularization is of paramount importance. The Factor- VII domain in the Fc fusion binds with high affinity and specificity to tissue factor, while the aglycosylated Fc effector domain, recruits natural killer cells initiating a powerful cytolytic response against cells expressing tissue factor. [0174] The amino acid sequence for Factor- VII is well known in the art, and may be obtained from the GenBank database, for example, Gen Bank Ace. No. AAA51983. A chloroplast biased nucleotide sequence is generated which encodes extracellular domain (see Franklin et al. Plant J (2002) 30:733-744, Mayfield et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2003) 100:438-442, Mayfield et al., Plant J (2004) 37:449-458) using PCR based oligonucleotide gene assembly (Stemmer et al., Gene (1995) 164:49-53). Once assembled, the sequence will be linked the hinge, CH2-CH3 domains of heavy chain hlgGl using an in frame amino acid linker (low complexity) located between the carboxy terminus of the ECD of the receptor and amino terminus of the Fc region. The fusion protein may be purified by Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography. b. Glucagon-like protein- 1 (GLP-I)-Fc fusion\n\n\n[0175] GLP-I is a beta-cell growth factor recently identified as a promising strategy to enhance functional beta-cell mass and restore insulin secretion in patients with type 1 diabetes. Native GLP-I has a short circulating half-life (< 2 min) that results mainly from rapid enzymatic inactivation or renal clearance. Therefore, continuous subcutaneous infusion by pump is \n\n necessary to maintain GLP-I action in vivo. GLP-I-Fc fusions have proven to have longer half- lives and are promising candidates for protecting against the onset of diabetes. [0176] The amino acid sequence for GLP-I is well known in the art, and may be obtained from the GenBank database, for example, Gen Bank Ace. No. NP 002045. A chloroplast biased nucleotide sequence is generated which encodes extracellular domain (see Franklin et al. Plant J (2002) 30:733-744, Mayfield et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2003) 100:438-442, Mayfield et al., Plant J (2004) 37:449-458) using PCR based oligonucleotide gene assembly (Stemmer et al., Gene (1995) 164:49-53). Once assembled, the sequence will be linked the hinge, C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3 domains of heavy chain hlgGl using an in frame amino acid linker (low complexity) located between the carboxy terminus of the ECD of the receptor and amino terminus of the Fc region. Again, the fusion protein may be purified by Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography. c. Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-Fc fusion\n\n\n[0177] Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) is a member of the hematopoietic cytokine family, which includes interleukin-3 (IL-3) and interleukin-5 (IL-5). It is a pleiotropic cytokine that was one of the first growth factors characterized and shown to be necessary for the proliferation, differentiation, activation, and survival of hematopoietic cells. GM-CSF shows therapeutic value by accelerating neutrophil recovery in disease-induced myelo- suppression such as bone marrow transplantation, chemotherapy, and infectious disease. GM- CSF-Fc fusions are promising molecules for maintaining GM-CSF activity while increasing its circulating half-life.\n\n\n[0178] The amino acid sequence for GM-CSF is well known in the art, and maybe obtained from the GenBank database, for example, Gen Bank Ace. No. AAA53578. A chloroplast biased nucleotide sequence is generated which encodes extracellular domain (see Franklin et al. Plant J (2002) 30:733-744, Mayfield et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2003) 100:438-442, Mayfield et al., Plant J (2004) 37:449-458) using PCR based oligonucleotide gene assembly (Stemmer et al., Gene (1995) 164:49-53). Once assembled, the sequence will be linked the hinge, C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3 domains of heavy chain hlgGl using an in frame amino acid linker (low complexity) located between the carboxy terminus of the ECD of the receptor and amino terminus of the Fc region. Again, the fusion protein may be purified by Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography. d. DNAse I-Fc fusion\n\n\n[0179] The ability of recombinant human DNAse I to degrade DNA to lower molecular weight fragments is the basis for its therapeutic use in cystic fibrosis patients. It is inhaled into the \n\n airways where it reduces the viscoelasticity of cystic fibrosis sputum, resulting in improved lung function fewer respiratory exacerbations DNAse I has also shown promise as an agent against systemic lupus erythematosus. DNAse I dimmers seem to have interesting properties compared to its monomers, such as an enhanced ability to degrade DNA, increased resistance to inhibition by salt etc. The fusion of DNAse I to Fc molecules would be a strategy for making such dimers and also for conferring a longer half-life on DNAse I.\n\n\n[0180] The amino acid sequence for DNAse I is well known in the art, and may be obtained from the GenBank database, for example, Gen Bank Ace. No. AAA63170. A chloroplast biased nucleotide sequence is generated which encodes extracellular domain (see Franklin et al Plant J (2002) 30-733-744, Mayfield et al , Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2003) 100-438-442, Mayfield et al., Plant J (2004) 37.449-458) using PCR based oligonucleotide gene assembly (Stemmer et al., Gene (1995) 164:49-53). Once assembled, the sequence will be linked the hinge, C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3 domains of heavy chain hlgGl using an in frame amino acid linker (low complexity) located between the carboxy terminus of the ECD of the receptor and amino terminus of the Fc region. Again, the fusion protein may be purified by Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography. e Extracellular Ig-like domain of human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-Fc fusion\n\n\n[0181] MOG is a glycoprotein believed to be important in the process of myelmization of nerves in the central nervous system. It is a transmembrane protein expressed on the surface of oligodendrocyte cell and on the outermost surface of myelin sheaths. Interest in MOG has centered on its role in demyelinating diseases, particularly multiple sclerosis (MS) Several studies have shown a role for antibodies against MOG in the pathogenesis of MS. Aglycosylated MOG peptides have shown to retain significant activity compared to full-length MOG, but their potential short half-life makes the use of MOG-Fc fusions promising for the treatment of demyelinating diseases\n\n\n[0182] The amino acid sequence for MOG is well known in the art, and may be obtained from the GenBank database, for example, Gen Bank Ace. No. CAI95562 A chloroplast biased nucleotide sequence is generated which encodes extracellular domain (see Franklin et al. Plant J (2002) 30:733-744, Mayfield et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2003) 100-438-442, Mayfield et al., Plant J (2004) 37 449-458) using PCR based oligonucleotide gene assembly (Stemmer et al., Gene (1995) 164 49-53) Once assembled, the sequence will be linked the hmge, C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3 domains of heavy chain hlgGl using an in frame amino acid linker (low complexity) located between the carboxy terminus of the ECD of the receptor and amino terminus of the Fc region Again, the fusion protein may be purified by Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography \n\n f. CD24-Fc fusion\n\n\n[0183] CD24, A glycosyl-phosphotidyl-inositol (GPI) anchored protein, has been identified as a genetic modifier for risk and progression of multiple sclerosis. It has also been shown to significantly reduce T cell activation. The extracellular domain of CD24 is a scant 31 amino acids, hence, its half life in sera would be exceedingly short. Fusion of CD24 to Fc domains would make this molecule a potentially valuable therapeutic in the treatment of MS and other autoimmune disorders. [0184] The amino acid sequence for CD24 is well known in the art, and may be obtained from the GenBank database, for example, Gen Bank Ace. No. AAH64619. A chloroplast biased nucleotide sequence is generated which encodes extracellular domain (see Franklin et al. Plant J (2002) 30:733-744, Mayfield et al., ProcNatl Acad Sci USA (2003) 100:438-442, Mayfield et al., Plant J (2004) 37:449-458) using PCR based oligonucleotide gene assembly (Stemmer et al., Gene (1995) 164:49-53). Once assembled, the sequence will be linked the hinge, C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3 domains of heavy chain MgGl using an in frame amino acid linker (low complexity) located between the carboxy terminus of the ECD of the receptor and amino terminus of the Fc region. Again, the fusion protein may be purified by Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography. g. Expression and purification of murine IgGl mAb via Protein G affinity\n\n\n[0185] An extremely useful antibody, termed NT73, was developed from an immunization with core E. coli RNA polymerase (Thompson et al., 1992. Biochemistry, 1992. 31 : 7003-8). It recognizes an epitope on the β' subunit of this multisubunit enzyme and this epitope was eventually mapped to a 13 amino acid or smaller sequence at the N-terminal end of the β' subunit (Thompson et al., 2003. Anal. Biochem. 2003, 323:171-179.). It also functions to recognize this epitope when transferred to a heterologous protein via recombinant DNA cloning. This has made the antibody a very useful reagent for immunopurification of epitope tagged proteins. We have sequenced the mRNAs encoding the murine light and heavy chain genes via RT-PCR. Genes encoding both the light and heavy chain proteins were synthesized de-novo and the codon usage of both genes was optimized for expression in the C. reinhardtii chloroplast. Light chain gene expression was driven by the strong 16sA promoter/oϋpvl 5' UTR (16sA/atpA) while heavy chain expression was driven by the MB promoter/5 'UTR. Light chain cassettes, containing an N-terminal FLAG Tag, were introduced into the p321 vector for integration in the inverted repeat region of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast genome, while heavy chain cassettes, containing a C-terminal FLAG Tag, were introduced as direct replacements into the ChI B region in a construct which completely ablates this non-essential gene. Using particle gun mediated \n\n transformation, both of the above cassettes were co-transformed with plasmid p228 (which confers resistance to spectinomycin) into the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii. Homoplasmic lines were generated and large scale cultures were grown to assess purification of this mlgGl mAb using Protein G affinity matrices. h. Murine IgGl purification.\n\n\n[0186] Frozen C. reinhardtii biomass (53.Ig) was resuspended in TBST-pH7.4 plus ImM PMSF. Cells were cracked using a Micriofluidics microfluidizer operating at 16,000 psi, the debris pelleted and the lysate filtered through a 0.8 um dead end filter followed by a 0.2 um dead end filter. The lysate was incubated with Protein-G agarose (Upstate) resin overnight at 4 deg C with mixing. The following day, Protein G agarose with bound alga expressed mAb was packaged into chromatography columns (BioRad Polyprep). the flow through was collected and analyzed. Columns were washed with 30 column volumes of TBST pH 7.4 and the wash fractions collected for analysis. Recombinant mAb was eluted from the Protein G matrix using 0.2M glycine HCl, pH 2.5 and the solution immediately neutralized via addition of IM Tris«Cl, pH 9.0. The antibody solution was concentrated to 90 ng/ul in a final volume of 196.8 ul, using an Amicon Ultra 10,000 MWCO concentrator.\n\n\n[0187] We also developed a chimeric murine-human version of the NT73 antibody molecule by cloning the murine light and heavy chain variable domains onto human light and heavy chain constant domains. In this instance, light chain and heavy chain gene expression were both driven by the strong 16sA promoter/atpA 5' UTR (16sA/atpA). Light chain cassettes, containing an N- terminal FLAG Tag, were introduced into the p321 vector for integration in the inverted repeat region of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast genome, while heavy chain cassettes, containing a C- terminal FLAG Tag, were introduced into a p3HB vector allowing for integration in the psbH region of the chloroplast genome. This vector contains a functional copy of the psbH gene. When transformed into a strain containing a disrupted copy of this gene, transformants at this locus can be selected for their ability to grow on minimal media. Using particle gun mediated transformation, both of the above cassettes were co-transformed with plasmid p228 (which confers resistance to spectinomycin) into the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii strain 137c(+)/psbH(-) and selected for their ability to grow on minimal/spec medium. Homoplasmic lines were generated and large-scale cultures were grown to assess our ability to purify this hlgGl mAb using standard Protein A affinity matrices, i.

Said properties are the following: the analgesic effect, the antiinflammatory activity, the reduction of the blood and intraocular pressure, the antiemetic activity. To tetrahydro-cannabinols the negative effects which are associated to the marijuana use have furthermore been correlated, with particular reference to the perception psychological distortion, to the motory coordination loss, to the euphoria, to the sedative effect. The pharmacological action of cannabinoids appears directly correlated to their affinity towards two different classes of specific receptors belonging to the family of the “G protein-coupled” receptors: the CB1 receptors, located in the central nervous system besides that in peripheral tissues, and the CB2 receptors, found in the cerebellum (Q. J. Lu et al.; \nVisual Neurosci.; \n2000, 17, 91-95) but which are mostly found in peripheral tissues (M. Glass; \nProgr. Neuro\n-\nPsychopharmacol. \n& \nBiol. Psychiat.; \n2001, 25, 743-765). In the brain the CB1 receptors are abundantly expressed in the hippocampus, in the cortical regions, in the cerebellum and inside the basal ganglia. Among the peripheral tissues wherein the CB1 receptors have been found, the testicles, the small intestine, the vesica, the deferent duct can be mentioned. The CB1 receptors have been furthermore identified both in the rat eye and in the human eye, both in the retina and in the iris and in the ciliary body (A. Porcella et al.; \nMolecular Brain Research; \n1998, 58, 240-245; A. Porcella et al.; \nEuropean Journal of Neuroscience; \n2000, 12, 1123-1127). The CB2 receptors are on the contrary prevailingly located in the marginal zones of the spleen, in tonsils, besides in several cells of the immune system, as macrophages, monocytes, the cells of the bone marrow, of thymus and of pancreas. Other cells of the immune system wherein the CB2 receptors are significantly present are T4 and T8 cells, the polymorphonucleated leucocytes, in particular the cells called “natural killers” and lymphocytes B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds able to interact, as agonists or antagonists, with the CB2 receptors can therefore be used in the treatment of diseases wherein immune system cells or immune disorders are involved. The activation (modulation) of the CB2 receptors is also important in the treatment of other diseases, such as in the treatment of osteoporosis, renal ischaemia, pain, neuropathic pain, inflammatory conditions, lateral amyotrophic sclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds with affinity for the CB1 receptors can be used in the treatment of eye diseases such as glaucoma, pulmonary diseases, as asthma and chronic bronchitis, inflammations as arthritis, allergies and allergic reactions, such as allergic rhinitis, contact dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis. Said compounds can also be used in the treatment of pain, in conditions of anxiety, behaviour disorders, delirium conditions, psychotic problems in general, furthermore for the treatment of schizophrenia, depression and in the treatment of drug and/or alcohol abuse and dependence, (for example alcoholism and tabagism). The same compounds can also be used to combat vomit, nausea, vertigoes, especially in the case of patients subjected to chemotherapy, in the treatment of neuropathies, hemicrania, stress, psychosomatic origin diseases, epilepsy, Tourette syndrome, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease, senile dementia and in the case of recognition disorders and memory loss. Further applications of the compounds having affinity towards the CB1 receptors are the treatment of pathologies related to appetite disorders (obesity, bulimia), pathologies of the gastrointestinal tract and of the bladder, cardiovascular diseases, urinary, erectile and fertility disorders, neuroinflammatory pathologies, such as multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, viral encefalitis. For example some CB1 agonist active principles are successfully used in the treatment of nausea and vomit associated to chemotherapy and in the appetite whetting in AIDS patients. Compounds having antagonist activity towards the CB1 receptors can be used for example in the treatment of psychosis, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, obesity, neurological diseases (for example: dementia, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, epilepsy, Tourette syndrome), in conditions of memory loss, of central nervous system diseases involving the neurotransmission of cannabinoids, in the treatment of gastrointestinal and/or cardiovascular disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds which are effective in activating cannabinoid receptors show immunosuppressive activity and are used in the treatment of eye inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases, for instance uveitis and uveoretinitis (H. Xu et al., J. Leukocyte Biology, 82, 2007, 532-541). They are used also for treating retina neurodegeneration (G. Pryce et al., Brain 126 2003 2191-2202).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith reference to the wide pharmacological applications of cannabinoids, in the latest years several studies have been carried out for finding endocannabinoids and for the synthesis of new compounds capable of selectively interacting with the two subclasses of CB1 and CB2 cannabinoidergic receptors. Researches have led on the one hand to the identification of anandamide endocannabinoids (arachidonyl ethanolamide) and 2-arachidonyl glycerol, on the other hand to the preparation of different classes of synthesis compounds, agonist or antagonist towards the CB1 or CB2 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe class of the compounds having agonist activity towards the CB1 receptors (cannabimimetic activity) comprises both synthesis compounds with a basic structure directly derived from that of Δ\n9\n-THC, as (−)-11-OH-Δ\n8\nTHC-dimethylheptyl (HU210) and nabilone, and compounds structurally different from Δ\n9\n-THC, as aminoalkylindols of the WIN 55,212-2 series (M. Pacheco et al.; \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.; \n1991, 257, 1701-183) or as bicyclic cannabinols (non classic cannabinoids) which refer to the compound CP 55,940 (M. Glass; \nProgr. Neuro\n-\nPsychopharmacol. & Biol. Psychiat.; \n2001, 25, 743-765). The compounds having cannabimimetic activity show in vivo the following effects: hypoactivity, hypothermia, analgesia and catalepsy (B. R. Martin et al.; \nPharmacol. Biochem. Behav.; \n1991, 40, 471-478; P. B. Smith et al.; \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.; \n1994, 270, 219-227).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClinical data have shown that the CB1 antagonist pyrazole compound Rimonabant is effective in reducing both weight and metabolic and/or cardiovascular risk factors in patients with metabolic syndrome and/or dyslipidemia (J. P. Després et al., the New England Journal of Medicine, 2005, 353, 2121-2134, D. Tonstad, Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases 2006, 16, 156-162. The effectiveness of Rimonabant in reducing metabolic and/or cardiovascular risk factors has been shown also in patients with type 2 diabetes (A. J. Scheen et Al., Lancet 2006, 368 1660-1672).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA known compound for the selectivity towards the CB2 receptors, having agonist activity towards this subclass of receptors, is the compound 1-propyl-2-methyl-3-naphthoylindole, called JWH-015 (M. Glass; \nProgr. Neuro\n-\nPsychopharmacol. \n& \nBiol. Psychiat.; \n2001, 25, 743-765).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong the synthesis compounds having high affinity for the CB1 and/or CB2 cannabinoidergic receptors, condensed tricyclic derivatives containing one pyrazole ring are described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntagonist compounds having high affinity for the cannabinoidergic receptors and, especially, high selectivity for the CB1 receptors are described for example in EP 1,230,244. In particular, said CB1 antagonist compounds have the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein Z\n1\n, w\n2\n, w\n3\n, w\n4\n, w\n5\n, w\n6\n, g\n2\n, g\n3\n, g\n4\n, g\n5 \nhave different meanings; X—Y— represent a group selected from: —(CH\n2\n)\nd\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—S(O)\ng\n—, —S(O)\ng\n—CH\n2\n—, with d equal to 1 or 2, g equal to zero, 1 or 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the document no mention is made that the described compounds could be formulated under the form of a microemulsion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntagonist compounds having a high affinity for the cannabinoidergic receptors and, above all, high selectivity for the CB2 receptors, are described for example in EP 1,230,222.

No mention is made that these compounds have affinity for the CB1 and/or CB2 cannabinoid receptors. Furthermore no mention is made that the formulations of said compounds could also be in the form of a microemulsion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further class of condensed tricyclic compounds containing one, pyrazole ring is described in WO 03/070,706.

No indication is reported as to the affinity of the compounds for the CB1 and/or CB2 cannabinoid receptors. No mention is made that the compounds could also be formulated in the form of a microemulsion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the above mentioned patents and patent applications are obtained as oils, waxes or powders and have lipophilic characteristics. Therefore said compounds are insoluble in water or in aqueous solutions that are compatible with the various administration routes, for instance intravenous or intraperitoneal. Therefore the use as therapeutic agents of these compounds or of their corresponding salts is limited. In fact, as such, their effectiveness in the treatment of the above mentioned pathologies and disorders is very reduced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the known pharmaceutical formulations surfactants are generally used. It is well known that surfactants, especially if present in significant amounts, can give side effects such as anaphylactic shocks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe need was felt to have available pharmaceutical

To evaluate the affinity of a specific compound to a particular receptor it is necessary to challenge in a particular tissue preparation wherein those specific receptors are present the compound to be tested with a radioactive labelled compound whose affinity for the same receptors is known. The ability of the compound under test to displace the radioactive compound from the receptor site gives an index of the affinity of the compound under test for that specific receptor. The amount of radioactivity present in the receptor-compound complex allows furthermore to stimate with great accuracy the amount of compound bound to the receptor. By said method it is therefore possible to stablish quickly the affinity of a new compound towards a specific receptor and thus to determine its pharmacological activity. With the same experimental protocol it is possible to evaluate the affinity of the compound towards other receptors and thus establish its specificity degree toward said other receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe receptor binding technique, besides being used for the screening of new molecules with pharmacological activity, can give useful information on possible changes at receptor level, related for example to a prolonged exposure to drugs and/or to particular pathologies. In these conditions, indeed, changes in the amount of the receptors, or conformational changes can take place that alter the binding affinity of the agonists or antagonists, therefore affecting the functionality of the receptors themselves.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experimentation has been carried out according to the guide lines of the European Community for the animal experimentation (EEC n. 86/609), by using laboratory animals (mice) lodged twenty per cage, under standard stabulation conditions (temperature 22±2° C., relative humidity 60%, artificial lighting with light/dark cycle of 12 hours). The food and water were ad libitum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe procedure adopted, based on the use of the compound [\n3\nH]-CP-55,940 (New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass., USA), requires the use of the mouse brain as biological tissue for the evaluation of the affinity towards the CB1 receptors and of the mouse spleen for the affinity assay for the CB2 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the complete brain (excluding the cerebellum) and the spleen were quickly dissected and kept in ice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tissue was homogeneized in 15 volumes (weight/volume) of TME buffer (50 Mm Tris, 1 mM EDTA and 3 mM MgCl\n2\n, pH 7.4) by an Ultra-Turrax and subsequently centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1086×g in a centrifuge refrigerated at 4° C. The recovered supernatant was centrifuged at 45,000×g for 30 minutes at 4° C. by using a Beckman SW41 rotor and the obtained pellet was resuspended in 50 volumes of TME.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe thus obtained membranes (50-80 μg of proteins) were incubated in the presence of 1 nM of [\n3\nH]-CP55.940 for 1 hour at 30° C. in a final volume of 0.5 ml of TME buffer containing 5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA). The non specific binding was measured in the presence of CP55.940 at a 1 μM concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll the experiments were carried out in polypropylene test tubes pretreated with Sigma-Cote (Sigma Chemical Co. Ltd., Poole, UK) for reducing non specific binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to determine the competitive inhibition binding curves, eight different concentrations of each compound were used. As reference compounds SR141716A was used for the CB1 receptors and SR144528 was used for the CB2 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncubation was stopped by addition of TME buffer (at 4° C.) containing 5 mg/ml of BSA, and subsequent filtration under vacuum by Whatman GFC filters pretreated with 0.5% of polyethylamine (PEI) and by using a filtering device (Brandell, Gaithersburg, Md., USA). The filters were washed 3 times with 5 ml of Tris HCl buffer (pH 7.4, 4° C.) containing 1 mg/ml of BSA and separately placed in plastic vials containing 4 ml of scintillating liquid (Ultima Gold MV, Packard).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe radioactivity present in the filters was determined by a scintillator spectrophotometer (Tricarb® 2100, Packard, Meridien, USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein determination was carried out by the Bradford method by using the protocol and the reactants supplied by Bio-Rad (Milano, Italy).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experiments were carried out in triplicate and the results confirmed in five independent experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe affinity of the compounds towards the CB1 and CB2 receptors has been expressed in Ki terms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Ki values, obtained with the compounds of the present invention in the test in vitro, are reported in Table 1. By comparison, in the Table, the affinity values of the reference compounds SR144528 and SR141716A (Rimonobant®) are reported.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Table shows that the compounds of the present invention have activity on the CB1 and/or CB2 receptors comparable with that of the reference compounds.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4: in vitro activity of the compounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof the invention on CB1 and CB2 receptors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nCB1 (brain)\n\n\nCB2 (spleen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nexample\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.1\n\n\n20.0 ± 5.0\n\n\n23.3 ± 1.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.3\n\n\n21.7 ± 3.0\n\n\n325 ± 38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.4\n\n\n 2.6 ± 0.17\n\n\n19.6 ± 1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.8\n\n\n2500 ± 740\n\n\n62.0 ± 9.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.15\n\n\n350 ± 76\n\n\n 2.3 ± 0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.20\n\n\n1788 ± 330\n\n\n12.9 ± 1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.21\n\n\n2722 ± 652\n\n\n29.5 ± 8.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.22\n\n\n4064 ± 64 \n\n\n37.7 ± 6.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.23\n\n\n1247 ± 129\n\n\n15.6 ± 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.24\n\n\n38.2 ± 6.0\n\n\n 2.3 ± 0.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.25\n\n\n2398 ± 629\n\n\n 3.7 ± 0.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.26\n\n\n257 ± 7 \n\n\n 2.5 ± 0.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.27\n\n\n469 ± 64\n\n\n 3.5 ± 0.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.28\n\n\n363 ± 92\n\n\n28.0 ± 6.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3.29\n\n\n 537 ± 132\n\n\n17.5 ± 0.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSR144528 (comp)\n\n\n 70 ± 10\n\n\n 0.28 ± 0.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSR141716A (comp)\n\n\n  1.8 ± 0.075\n\n\n514 ± 30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 4.1\n\n\nComparison\n\n\n4.1.a Preparation of 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-6-methyl-1H-benzofuro[3,2-c]pyrazole-3-carboxamide\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo a solution of the acid obtained in ex. 2.9 (0.09 g; 0.25 mmol) in methylene chloride (2 ml) HOBt (0.04 g; 0.30 mmol) and EDC (0.06 g, 0.30 mmol) were added.

The CFTR inhibitory compounds and derivatives thereof, as well as compositions, pharmaceutical formulations and methods of use are described in more detail below.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nDiarrhea is commonly caused by infection by a variety of bacteria, parasites and viruses and is a fundamental threat to regions lacking potable water. Preventing exposure to the pathogens responsible for diarrhea is the only way to avert infection. Unfortunately, this requires massive improvement in both sanitation and nutritional status in developing countries, which is unlikely to occur in the short term. Thus, it is a continuing threat to the third world and especially the health of children who may lack a robust immune response. Second only to respiratory infection, diarrheal disease is responsible for approximately two million deaths in children under five years of age annually. Many who do survive have lasting health problems due to the effects of recurrent infections and malnutrition. Diarrheal diseases also are the major cause of childhood hospitalization, primarily for dehydration. Each year in developing countries, roughly four billion episodes of acute diarrhea, or approximately 3.2 episodes per child, occur among children under five years of age. See, in general, Diarrheal Diseases Fact Sheet, available at www.oneworldhealth.org.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiarrheal episodes can be either acute or persistent (lasting two weeks or more). Of all childhood infectious diseases, diarrheal diseases are thought to have the greatest effect on growth, by reducing appetite, altering feeding patterns, and decreasing absorption of nutrients. The number of diarrheal episodes in the first two years of life has been shown not only to affect growth but also fitness, cognitive function, and school performance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe primary cause of death from diarrhea is dehydration. As dehydration worsens, symptoms progress from thirst, restlessness, decreased skin turgor and sunken eyes to diminished consciousness, rapid and feeble pulse and low or undetectable blood pressure. Diarrhea also often arises as a result of coinfection with other diseases such as malaria and HIV and is frequently a comorbidity factor associated with deaths due to these diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well established that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein plays a pivotal role in enterotoxin-mediated secretory diarrheal disease and dehydration which occurs as a consequence of body fluid loss following electrolyte transport across the epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract. Kunzelmann and Mall, (2002) Physiological Rev. 82(1):245-289. CFTR is a 1480 amino acid protein that is a member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. The CFTR cAMP-activated Cl\n−\n channel is expressed primarily in the apical or luminal surface of epithelial cells in mammalian intestine, lungs, proximal tubules (and cortex and medulla) of kidney, pancreas, testes, sweat glands and cardiac tissue where it functions as the principal pathway for secretion of Cl(−)/HCO\n3\n(−) and Na(+)/H(+). See Field et al. (1974) N. Engl. J. Med. 71:3299-3303 and Field et al. (1989) N. Eng. J. Med. 321:879-883.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn secretory diarrhea, intestinal colonization by pathogenic microorganisms alter ion transport, disrupt tight cell junctions and activate an inflammatory response. Enterotoxins produced by Enterotoxigenic \nEscherichia coli \n(ETEC) and \nVibrio cholerae \nbind to receptors on the luminal surface of enterocytes and generates intracellular second messengers that lead to upregulation of CFTR and secretion of negatively charged ions (e.g. chloride) across the intestinal epithelia which creates the driving force for sodium and water secretion. Kunzelmann (2002) supra. Luminal CFTR therefore plays the central role in secretory diarrhea and the excessive loss of water which leads to severe dehydration and rapid progression to death if untreated. Blocking ion transport across luminal CFTR channels has been proposed as one way to treat secretory diarrhea and other disease etiologically related to ion transport across CFTR channels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutations in CFTR protein, e.g., ΔF508, are responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common serious inherited diseases amongst Caucasians, affecting approximately 1 in 2,500 individuals. Pedemonte et al. (2005) J. Clin. Invest. 115(9):2564-2571. In the United States and in the majority of European countries, the incidence of carriers of the CF gene is 1 in 20 to 1 in 30. CF can affect many organs including sweat glands (high sweat electrolyte with depletion in a hot environment), intestinal glands (meconium ileus), biliary tree (biliary cirrhosis), pancreas (CF patients can be pancreatic insufficient and may require enzyme supplements in the diet) and bronchial glands (chronic bronchopulmonary infection with emphysema). Hormones, such as a β-adrenergic agonist, or a toxin, such as cholera toxin, lead to an increase in cAMP, activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and phosphorylation of the CFTR Cl\n−\n channel, which causes the channel to open. An increase in cell Ca\n2+\n can also activate different apical membrane channels. Phosphorylation by protein kinase C can either open or shut Cl\n−\n channels in the apical membrane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe transport of fluids mediated by CFTR also has been linked to Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD). Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic renal disorder occurring in 1:1000 individuals and is characterized by focal cyst formation in all tubular segments. Friedman, J. Cystic Diseases of the Kidney, in PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF MEDICAL GENETICS (A. Emery and D. Rimoin, Eds.) pp. 1002-1010, Churchill Livingston, Edinburgh, U.K. (1983); Striker & Striker (1986) Am. J. Nephrol. 6:161-164. Extrarenal manifestations include hepatic and pancreatic cysts as well as cardiovascular complications. Gabow & Grantham (1997) Polycystic Kidney Disease, in DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY (R. Schrier & C. Gottschalk, Eds.), pp. 521-560, Little Brown, Boston; Welling & Grantham (1996) Cystic Diseases of the Kidney, in RENAL PATHOLOGY (C. Tisch & B. Brenner, Eds.) pp: 1828-1863, Lippincott, Philadelphia. Studies suggest that increased cAMP-mediated chloride secretion provides the electrochemical driving force, which mediates fluid secretion in cystic epithelia. Nakanishi et al. (2001) J. Am. Soc. Nethprol. 12:719-725. PKD is a leading cause of end-stage renal failure and a common indication for dialysis or renal transplantation. PKD may arise sporadically as a developmental abnormality or may be acquired in adult life, but most forms are hereditary. Among the acquired forms, simple cysts can develop in kidney as a consequence of aging, dialysis, drugs and hormones. Rapaport (2007) QJM 100:1-9 and Wilson (2004) N. Eng. J. Med. 350:151-164.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCFTR inhibitors have been discovered, although they have a weak potency and lack CFTR specificity. The oral hypoglycemic agent glibenclamide inhibits CFTR Cl\n−\n conductance from the intracellular side by an open channel blocking mechanism (Sheppard & Robinson (1997) J. Physiol. 503:333-346; Zhou et al. (2002) J. Gen. Physiol. 120:647-662) at high micromolar concentrations where it affects Cl\n−\n and other cation channels. Rabe et al. (1995) Br. J. Pharmacol. 110:1280-1281 and Schultz et al. (1999) Physiol. Rev. 79:S109-S144. Other non-selective anion transport inhibitors including diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC), 5-nitro-2(3-phenylpropyl-amino)benzoate (NPPB), flufenamic acid and niflumic acid also inhibit CFTR by occluding the pore at an intracellular site. Dawson et al. (1999) Physiol. Rev. 79:S47-S75; McCarty (2000) J. Exp. Biol. 203:1947-1962, Cai et al. (2004) J. Cyst. Fibrosis 3:141-147. Hence, high-affinity CFTR inhibitors can have clinical applications in the therapy of secretory diarrheas, cystic kidney disease, and other associated disorder reported to be mediated by functional CFTR.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention is directed to one or more of compounds, compositions and methods which are useful in treating diarrhea.

Rather it should be noted that the descriptions of various embodiments provided herein may be of overlapping scope. The embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative and are not meant to limit the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso throughout this disclosure, various publications, patents and published patent specifications are referenced by an identifying citation. The disclosures of these publications, patents and published patent specifications are hereby incorporated by reference into the present disclosure in their entirety to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.\n\n\n \nA. Definitions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of organic chemistry, pharmacology, immunology, molecular biology, microbiology, cell biology and recombinant DNA, which are within the skill of the art. See, e.g., Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis, MOLECULAR CLONING: A LABORATORY MANUAL, 2\nnd \nedition (1989); CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (F. M. Ausubel, et al. eds., (1987)); the series METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY (Academic Press, Inc.): PCR 2: A PRACTICAL APPROACH (M. J. MacPherson, B. D. Hames and G. R. Taylor eds. (1995)), Harlow and Lane, eds. (1988) ANTIBODIES, A LABORATORY MANUAL, and ANIMAL CELL CULTURE (R. I. Freshney, ed. (1987)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used in the specification and claims, the singular form “a,” “an” and “the” include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. For example, the term “a cell” includes a plurality of cells, including mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “animal” of diagnosis or treatment refers to an animal such as a mammal, or a human, ovine, bovine, feline etc. Non-human animals subject to diagnosis or treatment include, for example, simians, murine, such as, rat, mice, canine, leporid, livestock, sport animals, and pets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “comprising” is intended to mean that the compositions and methods include the recited elements, but not excluding others. “Consisting essentially of” when used to define compositions and methods, shall mean excluding other elements of any essential significance to the combination. Thus, a composition consisting essentially of the elements as defined herein would not exclude trace contaminants from the isolation and purification method and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as phosphate buffered saline, preservatives, and the like. “Consisting of” shall mean excluding more than trace elements of other ingredients. Embodiments defined by each of these transition terms are within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll numerical designations, e.g., pH, temperature, time, concentration, and molecular weight, including ranges, are approximations which are varied (+) or (−) by increments of 0.1. It is to be understood, although not always explicitly stated that all numerical designations are preceded by the term “about.” It also is to be understood, although not always explicitly stated, that the reagents described herein are merely exemplary and that equivalents of such are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “polypeptide” and “protein” are synonymously used in their broadest sense to refer to a compound of two or more subunit amino acids, amino acid analogs, or peptidomimetics. The subunits may be linked by peptide bonds. In another embodiment, the subunit may be linked by other bonds, e.g., ester, ether, etc. As used herein the term “amino acid” refers to either natural and/or unnatural or synthetic amino acids, including glycine and both the D or L optical isomers, and amino acid analogs and peptidomimetics. A peptide of three or more amino acids is commonly called an oligopeptide if the peptide chain is short. If the peptide chain is long, the peptide is commonly called a polypeptide or a protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Hybridization” refers to a reaction in which one or more polynucleotides react to form a complex that is stabilized via hydrogen bonding between the bases of the nucleotide residues. The hydrogen bonding may occur by Watson-Crick base pairing, Hoogstein binding, or in any other sequence-specific manner. The complex may comprise two strands forming a duplex structure, three or more strands forming a multi-stranded complex, a single self-hybridizing strand, or any combination of these. A hybridization reaction may constitute a step in a more extensive process, such as the initiation of a PCR reaction, or the enzymatic cleavage of a polynucleotide by a ribozyme.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHybridization reactions can be performed under conditions of different “stringency.” In general, a low stringency hybridization reaction is carried out at about 40° C. in 10×SSC or a solution of equivalent ionic strength/temperature. A moderate stringency hybridization is typically performed at about 50° C. in 6×SSC, and a high stringency hybridization reaction is generally performed at about 60° C. in 1×SSC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen hybridization occurs in an antiparallel configuration between two single-stranded polynucleotides, the reaction is called “annealing” and those polynucleotides are described as “complementary.” A double-stranded polynucleotide can be “complementary” or “homologous” to another polynucleotide, if hybridization can occur between one of the strands of the first polynucleotide and the second. “Complementarity” or “homology” (the degree that one polynucleotide is complementary with another) is quantifiable in terms of the proportion of bases in opposing strands that are expected to form hydrogen bonding with each other, according to generally accepted base-pairing rules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA polynucleotide or polynucleotide region (or a polypeptide or polypeptide region) has a certain percentage (for example, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95%) of “sequence identity” to another sequence when aligned, that percentage of bases (or amino acids) are the same in comparing the two sequences. This alignment and the percent homology or sequence identity can be determined using software programs known in the art, for example those described in CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (F. M. Ausubel et al., eds., 1987) Supplement 30, section 7.7.18, Table 7.7.1. Preferably, default parameters are used for alignment. A preferred alignment program is BLAST, using default parameters. In particular, preferred programs are BLASTN and BLASTP, using the following default parameters: Genetic code=standard; filter=none; strand=both; cutoff=60; expect=10; Matrix=BLOSUM62; Descriptions=50 sequences; sort by=HIGH SCORE; Databases=non-redundant, GenBank+EMBL+DDBJ+PDB+GenBank CDS translations+SwissProtein+SPupdate+PIR. Details of these programs can be found at the following Internet address: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/BLAST.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of sequence alignment software programs are available in the art. Non-limiting examples of these programs are BLAST family programs including BLASTN, BLASTP, BLASTX, TBLASTN, and TBLASTX (BLAST is available from the worldwide web at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/), FastA, Compare, DotPlot, BestFit, GAP, FrameAlign, ClustalW, and Pileup. These programs are obtained commercially available in a comprehensive package of sequence analysis software such as GCG Inc.'s Wisconsin Package. Other similar analysis and alignment programs can be purchased from various providers such as DNA Star's MegAlign, or the alignment programs in GeneJockey. Alternatively, sequence analysis and alignment programs can be accessed through the world wide web at sites such as the CMS Molecular Biology Resource at sdsc.edu/ResTools/cmshp.html. Any sequence database that contains DNA or protein sequences corresponding to a gene or a segment thereof can be used for sequence analysis. Commonly employed databases include but are not limited to GenBank, EMBL, DDBJ, PDB, SWISS-PROT, EST, STS, GSS, and HTGS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParameters for determining the extent of homology set forth by one or more of the aforementioned alignment programs are known. They include but are not limited to p value, percent sequence identity and the percent sequence similarity. P value is the probability that the alignment is produced by chance. For a single alignment, the p value can be calculated according to Karlin et al. (1990) PNAS 87:2246. For multiple alignments, the p value can be calculated using a heuristic approach such as the one programmed in BLAST. Percent sequence identify is defined by the ratio of the number of nucleotide or amino acid matches between the query sequence and the known sequence when the two are optimally aligned. The percent sequence similarity is calculated in the same way as percent identity except one scores amino acids that are different but similar as positive when calculating the percent similarity. Thus, conservative changes that occur frequently without altering function, such as a change from one basic amino acid to another or a change from one hydrophobic amino acid to another are scored as if they were identical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Alkyl” refers to monovalent saturated aliphatic hydrocarbyl groups having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms.

For example, the substituent “arylalkyloxycarbonyl” refers to the group (aryl)-(alkyl)-O—C(O)—.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is understood that in all substituted groups defined above, polymers or other compounds arrived at by defining substituents with further substituents to themselves (e.g., substituted aryl having a substituted aryl group or another group as a substituent which is itself substituted with a substituted aryl group or another group, which is further substituted by a substituted aryl group or another group etc.) are not intended for inclusion herein. In such cases, the maximum number of such substitutions is four. For example, serial substitutions of substituted aryl groups with two other substituted aryl groups are limited to -substituted aryl-(substituted aryl)-substituted aryl-(substituted aryl).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, it is understood that the above definitions are not intended to include impermissible substitution patterns (e.g., methyl substituted with 5 fluoro groups). Such impermissible substitution patterns are well known to the skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “effective amount” is an amount sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results. An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations, applications or dosages. Such delivery is dependent on a number of variables including the time period for which the individual dosage unit is to be used, the bioavailability of the therapeutic agent, the route of administration, etc. It is understood, however, that specific dose levels of the therapeutic agents of the present invention for any particular subject depends upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, bioavailability of the compound, the route of administration, the age of the animal and its body weight, general health, sex, the diet of the animal, the time of administration, the rate of excretion, the drug combination, and the severity of the particular disorder being treated and form of administration. Treatment dosages generally may be titrated to optimize safety and efficacy. Typically, dosage-effect relationships from in vitro and/or in vivo tests initially can provide useful guidance on the proper doses for patient administration. Studies in animal models generally may be used for guidance regarding effective dosages for treatment of diseases such as diarrhea and PKD. In general, one will desire to administer an amount of the compound that is effective to achieve a serum level commensurate with the concentrations found to be effective in vitro. Thus, where a compound is found to demonstrate in vitro activity, for example as noted in the Tables discussed below one can extrapolate to an effective dosage for administration in vivo. These considerations, as well as effective formulations and administration procedures are well known in the art and are described in standard textbooks. Consistent with this definition and as used herein, the term “therapeutically effective amount” is an amount sufficient to treat a specified disorder or disease or alternatively to obtain a pharmacological response such as inhibiting function CFTR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “treating” or “treatment” of a disease in a patient refers to (1) preventing the symptoms or disease from occurring in an animal that is predisposed or does not yet display symptoms of the disease; (2) inhibiting the disease or arresting its development; or (3) ameliorating or causing regression of the disease or the symptoms of the disease. As understood in the art, “treatment” is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results, including clinical results. For the purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired results can include one or more, but are not limited to, alleviation or amelioration of one or more symptoms, diminishment of extent of a condition (including a disease), stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of a condition (including disease), delay or slowing of condition (including disease), progression, amelioration or palliation of the condition (including disease), states and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. Preferred are compounds that are potent and can be administered locally at very low doses, thus minimizing systemic adverse effects.\n\n\n \nB.

Such prodrugs are usually, but need not be, pharmacologically inactive until converted into their active drug form. The compounds described in this invention may include promoieties that are hydrolyzable or otherwise cleavable under conditions of use. For example, ester groups commonly undergo acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to yield the parent hydroxyl group when exposed to the acidic conditions of the stomach or base-catalyzed hydrolysis when exposed to the basic conditions of the intestine or blood. Thus, when administered to a subject orally, compounds that include ester moieties can be considered prodrugs of their corresponding hydroxyl, regardless of whether the ester form is pharmacologically active.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrugs designed to cleave chemically in the stomach to the active compounds can employ progroups including such esters. Alternatively, the progroups can be designed to metabolize in the presence of enzymes such as esterases, amidases, lipolases, and phosphatases, including ATPases and kinase, etc. Progroups including linkages capable of metabolizing in vivo are well known and include, by way of example and not limitation, ethers, thioethers, silylethers, silylthioethers, esters, thioesters, carbonates, thiocarbonates, carbamates, thiocarbamates, ureas, thioureas, and carboxamides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the prodrugs, any available functional moiety can be masked with a progroup to yield a prodrug. Functional groups within the compounds of the invention that can be masked with progroups include, but are not limited to, amines (primary and secondary), hydroxyls, sulfanyls (thiols), and carboxyls. A wide variety of progroups suitable for masking functional groups in active compounds to yield prodrugs are well-known in the art. For example, a hydroxyl functional group can be masked as a sulfonate, ester, or carbonate promoiety, which can be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the hydroxyl group. An amino functional group can be masked as an amide, carbamate, imine, urea, phosphenyl, phosphoryl, or sulfenyl promoiety, which can be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the amino group. A carboxyl group can be masked as an ester (including silyl esters and thioesters), amide, or pyrazolepromoiety, which can be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the carboxyl group. Other specific examples of suitable progroups and their respective promoieties will be apparent to those of skill in the art. All of these progroups, alone or in combinations, can be included in the prodrugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, the identity of the progroup is not critical, provided that it can be metabolized under the desired conditions of use, for example, under the acidic conditions found in the stomach and/or by enzymes found in vivo, to yield a biologically active group, e.g., the compounds as described herein. Thus, skilled artisans will appreciate that the progroup can comprise virtually any known or later-discovered hydroxyl, amine or thiol protecting group. Non-limiting examples of suitable protecting groups can be found, for example, in PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS, Greene & Wuts, 2nd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1991.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the identity of the progroup(s) can also be selected so as to impart the prodrug with desirable characteristics. For example, lipophilic groups can be used to decrease water solubility and hydrophilic groups can be used to increase water solubility. In this way, prodrugs specifically tailored for selected modes of administration can be obtained. The progroup can also be designed to impart the prodrug with other properties, such as, for example, improved passive intestinal absorption, improved transport-mediated intestinal absorption, protection against fast metabolism (slow-release prodrugs), tissue-selective delivery, passive enrichment in target tissues, and targeting-specific transporters. Groups capable of imparting prodrugs with these characteristics are well-known and are described, for example, in Ettmayer et al. (2004), J. Med. Chem. 47(10):2393-2404. All of the various groups described in these references can be utilized in the prodrugs described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, progroup(s) may also be selected to increase the water solubility of the prodrug as compared to the active drug. Thus, the progroup(s) may include or can be a group(s) suitable for imparting drug molecules with improved water solubility. Such groups are well-known and include, by way of example and not limitation, hydrophilic groups such as alkyl, aryl, and arylalkyl, or cycloheteroalkyl groups substituted with one or more of an amine, alcohol, a carboxylic acid, a phosphorous acid, a sulfoxide, a sugar, an amino acid, a thiol, a polyol, an ether, a thioether, and a quaternary amine salt. Numerous references teach the use and synthesis of prodrugs, including, for example, Ettmayer et al., supra and Bungaard et al. (1989) J. Med. Chem. 32(12): 2503-2507.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many of the compounds of the invention and prodrugs thereof, may exhibit the phenomena of tautomerism, conformational isomerism, geometric isomerism, and/or optical isomerism. For example, the compounds and prodrugs of the invention may include one or more chiral centers and/or double bonds and as a consequence may exist as stereoisomers, such as double-bond isomers (i.e., geometric isomers), enantiomers, diastereomers, and mixtures thereof, such as racemic mixtures. As another example, the compounds and prodrugs of the invention may exist in several tautomeric forms, including the enol form, the keto form, and mixtures thereof.

Methods of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds disclosed herein are useful in the treatment of a condition, disorder or disease or symptom of such condition, disorder, or disease, where the condition, disorder or disease is responsive to inhibition of functional CFTR. Such diseases or conditions include, but are not limited to the various forms of diarrhea, PKD and male infertility. The methods include administration of an effective amount of a compound defined herein (including those compounds set forth in Tables 1 or 2 or encompassed by formula I) or compositions comprising these compounds, thereby treating the disease. In one aspect, the compounds of the invention treat these diseases by inhibiting ion transport, e.g. HCO\n3\n \n−\n or halide ion, e.g., chloride ion, transport by CFTR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the compounds and compositions are administered or delivered to treat diarrhea and associated symptoms in an animal in need of such treatment. The term “animal” is used broadly to include mammals such as a human patient or other farm animals in need of such treatment. In one aspect, the animal is an infant (i.e., less than 2 years old, or alternatively, less than one year old, or alternatively, less than 6 months old, or alternatively, less than 3 months old, or alternatively, less than 2 months old, or alternatively, less than 1 one month old, or alternatively, less than 2 weeks old), a newborn (e.g., less than one week old, or alternatively, less than one day old), a pediatric patient (e.g., less than 18 years old or alternatively less than 16 years old) or yet further, a geriatric patient (e.g., greater than 65 years old).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince CFTR function has been associated with a wide spectrum of diseases (including secretory diarrhea, polycystic kidney disease (PKD), cardiac arrhythmia, disorders associated with neovascularization, male infertility, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders, pancreatic insufficiency, bacterial pulmonary conditions, and an abnormally concentrated sudoriparous secretion, chronic idiopathic pancreatitis, sinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), asthma, primary sclerosing cholangitis, congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), hydrosalpinx, liver disease, bile duct injury, mucoviscidosis, etc.), administration of an effective amount of a compound of this invention will treat such diseases when administered to an animal such as a human patient in need thereof. Accordingly, in one aspect the invention relates to a method of treating a disease in an animal, where the disease is responsive to inhibition of functional CFTR and is selected from the group consisting of secretory diarrhea, polycystic kidney disease (PKD), cardiac arrhythmia and disorders associated with neovascularization, by administering an effective amount of a compound defined herein (including those compounds set forth in Table 1 or 2 or encompassed by formula I) or compositions thereof, thereby treating the disease. Additional examples of diseases responsive to inhibiting of functional CFTR polypeptide that can be treated by the compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to, chronic idiopathic pancreatitis, sinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), asthma, primary sclerosing cholangitis, congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), hydrosalpinx, liver disease, bile duct injury, and mucoviscidosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the compounds of the invention are used in the treatment of the conditions associated with aberrantly increased intestinal secretion, particularly acute aberrantly increased intestinal secretion. Such intestinal secretion can result in intestinal inflammatory disorders and diarrhea, particularly secretory diarrhea. In another aspect, the invention relates to a treatment of diarrhea by administering an effective amount of the compound defined herein (including those compounds set forth in Table 1 or 2 or encompassed by formula I) or compositions thereof. In a further embodiment, the invention relates to treatment of secretory diarrhea by administering an effective amount of the compound defined herein (including those compounds set forth in Table 1 or 2 or encompassed by formula I) or compositions thereof. In a yet further aspect, the invention relates to the treatment of diarrhea by administering an effective amount of the compound defined herein (including those compounds set forth in Table 1 or 2 or encompassed by formula I) or compositions thereof, where the diarrhea is for example, infectious diarrhea, inflammatory diarrhea or diarrhea associated with chemotherapy. In one embodiment, the invention relates to a treatment of secretory diarrhea which involves use of compounds of the invention to inhibit the CFTR chloride channel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “diarrhea” intends a medical syndrome which is characterized by the primary symptom of diarrhea (or scours in animals) and secondary clinical symptoms that may result from a secretory imbalance and without regard to the underlying cause and therefore includes exudative (inflammatory), decreased absorption (osmotic, anatomic derangement, and motility disorders) and secretory. As noted previously, all forms of diarrhea have a secretory component. Symptoms include, but are not limited to impaired colonic absorption, ulcerative colitis, shigellosis, and amebiasis. Osmotic diarrhea can occur as a result of digestive abnormalities such as lactose intolerance. Anatomic derangement results in a decreased absorption surface caused by such procedures as subtotal colectomy and gastrocolic fistula. Motility disorders result from decreased contact time resulting from such diseases as hyperthyroidism and irritable bowel syndrome. Secretory diarrhea is characterized by the hypersecretion of fluid and electrolytes from the cells of the intestinal wall. In classical form, the hypersecretion is due to changes which are independent of the permeability, absorptive capacity and exogenously generated osmotic gradients within the intestine. However, all forms of diarrhea can manifest a secretory component.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds and compositions of this invention can also treat PKD and associated diseases or disorders such as Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease and Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease. The major manifestation of PKD is the progressive cystic dilation of renal tubules which ultimately leads to renal failure in half of affected individuals. U.S. Pat. No. 5,891,628 and Gabow, P. A. (1990) Am. J. Kidney Dis. 16:403-413. PKD-associated renal cysts may enlarge to contain several liters of fluid and the kidneys usually enlarge progressively causing pain. Other abnormalities such as hematuria, renal and urinary infection, renal tumors, salt and water imbalance and hypertension frequently result from the renal defect. Cystic abnormalities in other organs, including the liver, pancreas, spleen and ovaries are commonly found in PKD. Massive liver enlargement occasionally causes portal hypertension and hepatic failure. Cardiac valve abnormalities and an increased frequency of subarachnoid and other intracranial hemorrhage have also been observed in PKD. U.S. Pat. No. 5,891,628. Biochemical abnormalities which have been observed have involved protein sorting, the distribution of cell membrane markers within renal epithelial cells, extracellular matrix, ion transport, epithelial cell turnover, and epithelial cell proliferation. The most carefully documented of these findings are abnormalities in the composition of tubular epithelial cells, and a reversal of the normal polarized distribution of cell membrane proteins, such as the Na\n+\n/K\n+\n ATPase. Carone, F. A. et al. (1994) Lab. Inv. 70:437-448.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiarrhea amenable to treatment using the compounds of the invention can result from exposure to a variety of pathogens or agents including, without limitation, \ncholera \ntoxin (\nVibrio cholera\n), \nE. coli \n(particularly enterotoxigenic (ETEC)), \nSalmonella, \ne.g. Cryptosporidiosis, diarrheal viruses (e.g., rotavirus)), food poisoning, or toxin exposure that results in increased intestinal secretion mediated by CFTR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther diarrheas that can be treated by the compounds of the invention include diarrhea associated with AIDS (e.g., AIDS-related diarrhea), diarrheas caused by anti-AIDS medications such as protease inhibitors and inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders, such as ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease, chemotherapy, and the like. It has been reported that intestinal inflammation modulates the expression of three major mediators of intestinal salt transport and may contribute to diarrhea in ulcerative colitis both by increasing transepithelial Cl\n−\n secretion and by inhibiting the epithelial NaCl absorption. See, e.g., Lohi et al. (2002) Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol 283(3):G567-75).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, this invention provides use of a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2 or a composition comprising a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2, for treating diarrhea in an animal in need thereof, comprising administering to the animal an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2 or a composition comprising a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2, thereby treating diarrhea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, this invention provides use of a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2 or a composition comprising a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2, for treating polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in an animal in need thereof, comprising administering to the animal an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2 or a composition comprising a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2, thereby treating PKD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, this invention provides use of a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2 or a composition comprising a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2, for treating a disease in an animal, which disease is responsive to inhibiting of functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) polypeptide, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2 or a composition comprising a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2, thereby treating the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, this invention provides use of a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2 or a composition comprising a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2, for inhibiting the transport of a halide ion across a mammalian cell membrane expressing functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) polypeptide, comprising contacting the CFTR polypeptide with an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2 or a composition comprising a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2, thereby inhibiting the transport of the halide ion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, this invention provides use of a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2 or a composition comprising a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2, in the manufacture of a medicament for treating diarrhea in an animal in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, this invention provides use of a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2 or a composition comprising a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2, in the manufacture of a medicament for treating polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in an animal in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, this invention provides use of a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2 or a composition comprising a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2, in the manufacture of a medicament for treating a disease in an animal, which disease is responsive to inhibiting of functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, this invention provides use of a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2 or a composition comprising a compound of formula I or a compound of Table 1 or 2, in the manufacture of a medicament for inhibiting the transport of a halide ion across a mammalian cell membrane expressing functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds and compositions can be administered alone or combined with other suitable therapy such as Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT), supportive renal therapy, administration of an antiviral, vaccine, or other compound to treat the underlying infection or by administering an effective amount of an oral glucose-electrolyte solution to the animal. In another aspect, the compounds or compositions are co-administered with micronutrients, e.g., zinc, iron, and vitamin A. The therapies may be administered simultaneously or concurrently. Administration is by any appropriate route and varies with the disease or disorder to be treated and the age and general health of the animal or human patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can be administered on a mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., by an enteral route, such as oral, intraintestinal, intraluminally, rectal as a suppository, and the like) or to a mucosal surface of the oral or nasal cavities (e.g., intranasal, buccal, sublingual, and the like). In one embodiment, the compounds disclosed herein are administered in a pharmaceutical formulation suitable for oral administration, intraluminally or intraperitoneal administration. In another embodiment, the compounds disclosed herein are administered in a pharmaceutical formulation suitable for sustained release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can also find further use as male infertility drugs, by inhibition of CFTR activity in the testes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the compound is administered in a sustained release formulation which comprises the compound and an effective amount of a pharmaceutically-acceptable polymer. Such sustained release formulations provide a composition having a modified pharmacokinetic profile that is suitable for treatment as described herein. In one aspect of the invention, the sustained release formulation provides decreased C\nmax \nand increased T\nmax \nwithout altering bioavailability of the drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the compound is admixed with about 0.2% to about 5.0% w/v solution of a pharmaceutically-acceptable polymer. In other embodiments, the amount of pharmaceutically-acceptable polymer is between about 0.25% and about 5.0%; between about 1% and about 4.5%; between about 2.0% and about 4.0%; between about 2.5% and about 3.5%; or alternatively about 0.2%; about 0.25%; about 0.3%; about 0.35%; about 0.4%; about 0.45%; about 0.5%, about 1.0%, about 2.0%, about 3.0%, or about 4.0%, of the polymer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic and prophylactic methods of this invention are useful to treat human patients in need of such treatment. However, the methods are not to be limited only to human patient but rather can be practiced and are intended to treat any animal in need thereof. Such animals will include, but not be limited to farm animals and pets such as cows, pigs and horses, sheep, goats, cats and dogs. Diarrhea, also known as scours, is a major cause of death in these animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiarrhea in animals can result from any major transition, such as weaning or physical movement. Just as with human patients, one form of diarrhea is the result of a bacterial or viral infection and generally occurs within the first few hours of the animal's life. Infections with rotavirus and coronavirus are common in newborn calves and pigs. Rotavirus infection often occurs within 12 hours of birth. Symptoms of rotaviral infection include excretion of watery feces, dehydration and weakness. Coronavirus which causes a more severe illness in the newborn animals, has a higher mortality rate than rotaviral infection. Often, however, a young animal may be infected with more than one virus or with a combination of viral and bacterial microorganisms at one time. This dramatically increases the severity of the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another aspect of the present invention relates to a method for inhibiting the transport of a halide ion across a mammalian cell membrane expressing functional CFTR protein by contacting the cell expressing functional CFTR with an effective amount of the compound defined herein (including those compounds set forth in Table 1 or 2 or encompassed by formula I) or compositions thereof, thereby inhibiting the transport of the halide ion. As used herein, the term “functional CFTR” intends the full length wild type CFTR protein, a functional equivalent, or a biologically active fragment thereof. CFTR has been isolated, cloned and recombinantly expressed in a variety of cell types, which include but are not limited to Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) epithelial cells, Human colonic T84 cells, intestinal crypt cells, colonic epithelial cells, mouse fibroblast cells, bronchial epithelial, tracheobronchial epithelial, sero/mucous epithelial cells, kidney cells. Such cells are known to those skilled in the art and described, for example in Galietta et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276(23):19723-19728; Sheppard et al. (1994) Am. J. Physiol. 266 (Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 10):L405-L413; Chao et al. (1989) Biophys. J. 56:1071-1081 and Chao et al. (1990) J. Membrane Biol. 113:193-202. CFTR-expressing cell lines also are available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The open reading frame and polypeptide sequence of wild-type CFTR has been previously described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,984,487; 6,902,907; 6,730,777; and 6,573,073. The delta 508 mutant is specifically (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,160,729 and 5,240,846) excluded as an equivalent polynucleotide or polypeptide. Equivalents of function CFTR include, but are not limited to polynucleotides that have the same or similar activity to transport ions across the cell membrane. At the sequence level, equivalent sequences are at least 90% homologous (as determined under default parameters) to wild-type CFTR or those which hybridize under stringent conditions to the complement of these coding sequences. Biologically active functional fragments are those having contiguous identity to wild-type CFTR but contain less than 1480 amino acids. Functional fragments have been described. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,639,661 and 5,958,893.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods can be practiced in vivo in an acceptable animal model to confirm in vitro efficacy or to treat the disease or condition as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEquivalent polynucleotides also include polynucleotides that are greater than 75%, or 80%, or more than 90%, or more than 95% homologous to wild-type CFTR and as further isolated and identified using sequence homology searches. Sequence homology is determined using a sequence alignment program run under default parameters and correcting for ambiguities in the sequence data, changes in nucleotide sequence that do not alter the amino acid sequence because of degeneracy of the genetic code, conservative amino acid substitutions and corresponding changes in nucleotide sequence, and variations in the lengths of the aligned sequences due to splicing variants or small deletions or insertions between sequences that do not affect function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the halide ion is at least one of I\n−\n, Cl\n−\n, or Br\n−\n. In one preferred embodiment, the halide ion is Cl\n−\n. In one embodiment, the functional CFTR is wild-type full length CFTR. In one embodiment, the mammalian cell is an epithelial cell or a kidney cell. In one preferred embodiment, the mammalian cell is an intestinal epithelial cell or a colon epithelial cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen used to treat or prevent the diseases responsive to inhibiting of functional CFTR, the compounds of the present invention can be administered singly, as mixtures of one or more compounds of the invention, or in mixture or combination with other agents useful for treating such diseases and/or the symptoms associated with such diseases. The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in mixture or in combination with agents useful to treat other disorders or maladies, such as steroids, membrane stabilizers, 5-lipoxygenase (5LO) inhibitors, leukotriene synthesis and receptor inhibitors, inhibitors of IgE isotype switching or IgE synthesis, IgG isotype switching or IgG synthesis, β-agonists, tryptase inhibitors, aspirin, cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, methotrexate, anti-TNF drugs, retuxin, PD4 inhibitors, p38 inhibitors, PDE4 inhibitors, and antihistamines, to name a few. The compounds of the invention can be administered per se in the form of prodrugs or as pharmaceutical compositions, comprising an active compound or prodrug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method can be practiced in vitro or in vivo. When practiced in vitro, the method can be used to screen for compounds, compositions and methods that possess the same or similar activity. Activity is determined using the methods described below or others known to those of skill in the art and described in Verkmann and Galietta (2006) Progress in Respiratory Research, Vol. 34, pages 93-101.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, Human colonic T84 cells can be acquired from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC) and grown in standard culture conditions as described by the supplier. On the day before assay 25,000 T84 cells per well are plated into standard black walled, clear bottom 384-well assay plates in standard growth medium consisting of DMEM:F12 with 10% FBS and incubated overnight. On the day of the assay the plates are washed using a standard assay buffer (HBSS with 10 mM Hepes) and incubated for 15 minutes in serum free cell culture medium before the addition of a commercially available membrane potential sensitive fluorescent dye (FLIPR Red membrane potential dye, Molecular Devices Corporation). T84 cells are incubated with the FLIPR Red membrane potential dye for 45 minutes in the presence and absence of test compound before being transferred to a commercially available fluorescence imaging plate reader (FLIPR384, Molecular Devices Corporation). Fluorescence levels are monitored continuously every second for 150 seconds; after an initial 10 second baseline, CFTR channel activity is stimulated through the addition of 10 μM forskolin in the presence of 100 μM of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor iso-butyl-methylxanthine (IBMX). Addition of the forskolin leads to the activation of intracellular adenylyl cylase 1, elevating cAMP levels and results in the phosphorylation and opening of CFTR anion channels. CFTR channel opening causes chloride ion efflux and subsequent depolarization of the cells, which is measured by an increase in fluorescence. CFTR inhibitor compounds prevent cell depolarization and the associated increase in fluorescence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purpose of illustration only, Fisher Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells stably co-expressing wildtype human CFTR and a reporter protein such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or a mutant such as the yellow fluorescent protein-based Cl\n31\n/I\n−\n halide sensor e.g. YFP-H148Q can be cultured on 96-well plates as described in Gruenert (2004), supra or Ma et al. (2002) J. Clin. Invest. 110:1651-1658. Following a 48 hour incubation confluent FRT-CFTR-YFP-H148Q cells in 96-well plates are washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then CFTR halide conductance is activated by incubation for 5 minutes with a cocktail containing 5 μM, forskolin, 25 μM apigenin and 100 μM IBMX. Test compounds at a final concentration of 10 μM and 20 μM are added five minutes prior to assay of iodide influx in which cells are exposed to a 100 mM inwardly-directed iodide gradient. Baseline YFP fluorescence is recorded for two seconds followed by 12 seconds of continuous recording of fluorescence after rapid addition of the I\n−\n containing solution. to create a I\n−\n gradient. Initial rates of I\n−\n influx can be computed from the time course of decreasing fluorescence after the I\n−\n gradient as known to those skilled in the art and described in Yang et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem.: 35079-35085.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivity of the CFTR channel can also be measured directly using electrophysiological methods. An example protocol for measuring CFTR current is described as whole cell patch clamp method. As an illustration, recordings are conducted at room temperature (−21° C.) using a HEKA EPC-10 amplifier. Electrodes are fabricated from 1.7 mm capillary glass with resistances between 2 and 3 MΩ using a Sutter P-97 puller. For recording the CFTR channels, the extracellular solution can contain (in mM) 150 NaCl, 1 CaCl\n2\n, 1 MgCl\n2\n, 10 glucose, 10 mannitol, and 10 TES (pH 7.4), and the intracellular (pipette) solution can contain 120 CsCl, MgCl\n2\n, 10 TEA-Cl, 0.5 EGTA, 1 Mg-ATP and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CFTR channels are activated by forskoin (5 μM) in the extracellular solution. The cells are held at a potential of 0 mV and currents are recorded by a voltage ramp protocol from −120 mV to +80 mV over 500 ms every 10 seconds. No leak subtraction was employed. Compounds are superfused to individual cells using a Biologic MEV-9/EVH-9 rapid perfusion system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther in vitro methods for inhibitory activity have been described in the art, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0239740 (paragraphs [0184] and [0185]). For PKD, therapeutic activity is determined using art recognized methods as described, for example in U.S. Patent Publications Nos.: 2006/0088828; 2006/0079515 and 2003/0008288.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor in vivo confirmatory studies for treatment of diarrhea, mice (CD1 strain, 25-35 g) are deprived of food prior to surgery and can be anaesthetized with any suitable agent such as intraperinoneal ketamine (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (8 mg/kg). Body temperature should be maintained at 36-38° C. using a heating pad. A small abdominal incision is made and 3 closed intestinal (ileal and/or duodenum/jejunum) loops (length 15-30 mm) proximal to the cecum are isolated by sutures. Loops are injected with 100 μL of PBS or PBS containing cholera toxin (1 μg) with or without test compound at appropriate doses. The abdominal incision is closed with suture and mice are allowed to recover from anesthesia. Approximately four to six hours later, the mice are anesthetized, intestinal loops are removed, and loop length and weight are measured to quantify net fluid secretion to be measured as g/cm of loop.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor in vivo confirmatory studies of PKD therapeutica activity, the Han:SPRD rat is well characterized and can be used as a model of ADPKD.

Pharmaceutical Formulations and Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds or isomers, prodrug, tautomer, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, of the present invention can be formulated in the pharmaceutical compositions per se, or in the form of a hydrate, solvate, N-oxide, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, as described herein. Typically, such salts are more soluble in aqueous solutions than the corresponding free acids and bases, but salts having lower solubility than the corresponding free acids and bases may also be formed. The present invention includes within its scope solvates of the compounds and salts thereof, for example, hydrates. The compounds may have one or more asymmetric centers and may accordingly exist both as enantiomers and as diastereoisomers. It is to be understood that all such isomers and mixtures thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, this invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound provided herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another embodiment, this invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound provided herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment, this invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound selected from the compounds of the invention or isomers, hydrates, tautomer, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent, preservative, stabilizer, or mixture thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the methods can be practiced as a therapeutic approach towards the treatment of the conditions described herein. Thus, in a specific embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be used to treat the conditions described herein in animal subjects, including humans. The methods generally comprise administering to the subject an amount of a compound of the invention, or a salt, prodrug, hydrate, or N-oxide thereof, effective to treat the condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the subject is a non-human mammal, including, but not limited to, bovine, horse, feline, canine, rodent, or primate. In another embodiment, the subject is a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can be provided in a variety of formulations and dosages. It is to be understood that reference to the compound of the invention, or “active” in discussions of formulations is also intended to include, where appropriate as known to those of skill in the art, formulation of the prodrugs of the compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the compounds are provided as non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts such as those formed with hydrochloric acid, fumaric acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid, or phosphoric acid. Salts of amine groups may also comprise quaternary ammonium salts in which the amino nitrogen atom carries a suitable organic group such as an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or substituted alkyl moiety. Furthermore, where the compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may include metal salts such as alkali metal salts, e.g., sodium or potassium salts; and alkaline earth metal salts, e.g., calcium or magnesium salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be formed by conventional means, such as by reacting the free base form of the product with one or more equivalents of the appropriate acid in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble or in a solvent such as water which is removed in vacuo, by freeze drying, or by exchanging the anions of an existing salt for another anion on a suitable ion exchange resin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds described herein (or prodrugs thereof) can be manufactured by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilization processes. The compositions can be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients, or auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can be administered by oral, parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, ICV, intracisternal injection or infusion, subcutaneous injection, or implant), by inhalation spray nasal, vaginal, rectal, sublingual, urethral (e.g., urethral suppository) or topical routes of administration (e.g., gel, ointment, cream, aerosol, etc.) and can be formulated, alone or together, in suitable dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, excipients, and vehicles appropriate for each route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions for the administration of the compounds can be conveniently presented in dosage unit form and can be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The pharmaceutical compositions can be, for example, prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier, a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition the active object compound is included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired therapeutic effect. For example, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may take a form suitable for virtually any mode of administration, including, for example, topical, ocular, oral, buccal, systemic, nasal, injection, transdermal, rectal, and vaginal, or a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical administration, the compound(s) or prodrug(s) can be formulated as solutions, gels, ointments, creams, suspensions, etc., as is well-known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSystemic formulations include those designed for administration by injection (e.g., subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, or intraperitoneal injection) as well as those designed for transdermal, transmucosal, oral, or pulmonary administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful injectable preparations include sterile suspensions, solutions, or emulsions of the active compound(s) in aqueous or oily vehicles. The compositions may also contain formulating agents, such as suspending, stabilizing, and/or dispersing agents. The formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampules or in multidose containers, and may contain added preservatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the injectable formulation can be provided in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, including but not limited to sterile pyrogen free water, buffer, and dextrose solution, before use. To this end, the active compound(s) can be dried by any art-known technique, such as lyophilization, and reconstituted prior to use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, lozenges, tablets, or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate). The tablets can be coated by methods well known in the art with, for example, sugars, films, or enteric coatings. Additionally, the pharmaceutical compositions containing the 2,4-substituted pyrmidinediamine as active ingredient or prodrug thereof in a form suitable for oral use may also include, for example, troches, lozenges, aqueous, or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions intended for oral use can be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions, and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents, and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient (including drug and/or prodrug) in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients can be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents (e.g., corn starch or alginic acid); binding agents (e.g. starch, gelatin, or acacia); and lubricating agents (e.g., magnesium stearate, stearic acid, or talc). The tablets can be left uncoated or they can be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. They may also be coated by the techniques described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, elixirs, solutions, syrups, or suspensions, or they can be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations can be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives, or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin, or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol, cremophore™, or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations may also contain buffer salts, preservatives, flavoring, coloring, and sweetening agents as appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations for oral administration can be suitably formulated to give controlled release or sustained release of the active compound, as is well known. The sustained release formulations of this invention are preferably in the form of a compressed tablet comprising an intimate mixture of compound of the invention and a partially neutralized pH-dependent binder that controls the rate of compound dissolution in aqueous media across the range of pH in the stomach (typically approximately 2) and in the intestine (typically approximately about 5.5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo provide for a sustained release of compounds of the invention, one or more pH-dependent binders can be chosen to control the dissolution profile of the sustained release formulation so that the formulation releases compound slowly and continuously as the formulation is passed through the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. Accordingly, the pH-dependent binders suitable for use in this invention are those which inhibit rapid release of drug from a tablet during its residence in the stomach (where the pH is-below about 4.5), and which promotes the release of a therapeutic amount of the compound of the invention from the dosage form in the lower gastrointestinal tract (where the pH is generally greater than about 4.5). Many materials known in the pharmaceutical art as “enteric” binders and coating agents have a desired pH dissolution properties. The examples include phthalic acid derivatives such as the phthalic acid derivatives of vinyl polymers and copolymers, hydroxyalkylcelluloses, alkylcelluloses, cellulose acetates, hydroxyalkylcellulose acetates, cellulose ethers, alkylcellulose acetates, and the partial esters thereof, and polymers and copolymers of lower alkyl acrylic acids and lower alkyl acrylates, and the partial esters thereof. One or more pH-dependent binders present in the sustained release formulation of the invention are in an amount ranging from about 1 to about 20 wt %, more preferably from about 5 to about 12 wt % and most preferably about 10 wt %.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more pH-independent binders may be in used in oral sustained release formulation of the invention. The pH-independent binders can be present in the formulation of this invention in an amount ranging from about 1 to about 10 wt %, and preferably in amount ranging from about 1 to about 3 wt % and most preferably about 2 wt %.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sustained release formulation of the invention may also contain pharmaceutical excipients intimately admixed with the compound and the pH-dependent binder. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may include, for example, pH-independent binders or film-forming agents such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, neutral poly(meth)acrylate esters, starch, gelatin, sugars, carboxymethylcellulose, and the like. Other useful pharmaceutical excipients include diluents such as lactose, mannitol, dry starch, microcrystalline cellulose and the like; surface active agents such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters, sorbitan esters and the like; and coloring agents and flavoring agents. Lubricants (such as talc and magnesium stearate) and other tableting aids can also be optionally present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sustained release formulations of this invention have a compound of this invention in the range of about 50% by weight to about 95% or more by weight, and preferably between about 70% to about 90% by weight; a pH-dependent binder content of between 5% and 40%, preferably between 5% and 25%, and more preferably between 5% and 15%; with the remainder of the dosage form comprising pH-independent binders, fillers, and other optional excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in the conventional manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor rectal and vaginal routes of administration, the active compound(s) can be formulated as solutions (for retention enemas), suppositories, or ointments containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor nasal administration or administration by inhalation or insufflation, the active compound(s) or prodrug(s) can be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressurized packs or a nebulizer with the use of a suitable propellant (e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, fluorocarbons, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gas). In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit can be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator (for example, capsules and cartridges comprised of gelatin) can be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension can be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. The compounds may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal or urethral administration of the drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, gels, solutions, suspensions, etc., containing the compounds of the invention, can be employed. In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention can be formulated for topical administration with polyethylene glycol (PEG). These formulations may optionally comprise additional pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients such as diluents, stabilizers, and/or adjuvants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncluded among the devices which can be used to administer compounds of the invention, are those well-known in the art, such as metered dose inhalers, liquid nebulizers, dry powder inhalers, sprayers, thermal vaporizers, and the like. Other suitable technology for administration of particular compounds of the invention, includes electrohydrodynamic aerosolizers. As those skilled in the art will recognize, the formulation of compounds, the quantity of the formulation delivered, and the duration of administration of a single dose depend on the type of inhalation device employed as well as other factors. For some aerosol delivery systems, such as nebulizers, the frequency of administration and length of time for which the system is activated will depend mainly on the concentration of compounds in the aerosol. For example, shorter periods of administration can be used at higher concentrations of compounds in the nebulizer solution. Devices such as metered dose inhalers can produce higher aerosol concentrations and can be operated for shorter periods to deliver the desired amount of compounds in some embodiments. Devices such as dry powder inhalers deliver active agent until a given charge of agent is expelled from the device. In this type of inhaler, the amount of compounds in a given quantity of the powder determines the dose delivered in a single administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of compounds of the invention for administration from a dry powder inhaler may typically include a finely divided dry powder containing compounds, but the powder can also include a bulking agent, buffer, carrier, excipient, another additive, or the like. Additives can be included in a dry powder formulation of compounds of the invention, for example, to dilute the powder as required for delivery from the particular powder inhaler, to facilitate processing of the formulation, to provide advantageous powder properties to the formulation, to facilitate dispersion of the powder from the inhalation device, to stabilize to the formulation (e.g., antioxidants or buffers), to provide taste to the formulation, or the like. Typical additives include mono-, di-, and polysaccharides; sugar alcohols and other polyols, such as, for example, lactose, glucose, raffinose, melezitose, lactitol, maltitol, trehalose, sucrose, mannitol, starch, or combinations thereof; surfactants, such as sorbitols, diphosphatidyl choline, or lecithin; and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor prolonged delivery, the compound(s) or prodrug(s) of the invention can be formulated as a depot preparation for administration by implantation or intramuscular injection. The active ingredient can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (e.g., as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives (e.g., as a sparingly soluble salt). Alternatively, transdermal delivery systems manufactured as an adhesive disc or patch which slowly releases the active compound(s) for percutaneous absorption can be used. To this end, permeation enhancers can be used to facilitate transdermal penetration of the active compound(s). Suitable transdermal patches are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,407,713; U.S. Pat. No. 5,352,456; U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,213; U.S. Pat. No. 5,336,168; U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,561; U.S. Pat. No. 5,254,346; U.S. Pat. No. 5,164,189; U.S. Pat. No. 5,163,899; U.S. Pat. No. 5,088,977; U.S. Pat. No. 5,087,240; U.S. Pat. No. 5,008,110; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,921,475.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, other pharmaceutical delivery systems can be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are well-known examples of delivery vehicles that can be used to deliver active compound(s) or prodrug(s). Certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) may also be employed, although usually at the cost of greater toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active compound(s). The pack may, for example, comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device can be accompanied by instructions for administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound(s) or prodrug(s) described herein, or compositions thereof, will generally be used in an amount effective to achieve the intended result, for example, in an amount effective to treat or prevent the particular condition being treated. The compound(s) can be administered therapeutically to achieve therapeutic benefit or prophylactically to achieve prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated and/or eradication or amelioration of one or more of the symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that the patient reports an improvement in feeling or condition, notwithstanding that the patient may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For example, administration of a compound to a patient suffering from an diarrhea provides therapeutic benefit not only when the diarrhea is eradicated or ameliorated, but also when the patient reports a decrease in the severity or duration of the symptoms associated with the diarrhea. Therapeutic benefit also includes halting or slowing the progression of the disease, regardless of whether improvement is realized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of compound administered will depend upon a variety of factors, including, for example, the particular condition being treated, the mode of administration, the severity of the condition being treated, the age and weight of the patient, the bioavailability of the particular active compound. Determination of an effective dosage is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art. As known by those of skill in the art, the preferred dosage of compounds of the invention will also depend on the age, weight, general health, and severity of the condition of the individual being treated. Dosage may also need to be tailored to the sex of the individual and/or the lung capacity of the individual, where administered by inhalation. Dosage, and frequency of administration of the compounds or prodrugs thereof, will also depend on whether the compounds are formulated for treatment of acute episodes of a condition or for the prophylactic treatment of a disorder. A skilled practitioner will be able to determine the optimal dose for a particular individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor prophylactic administration, the compound can be administered to a patient at risk of developing one of the previously described conditions. For example, if it is unknown whether a patient is allergic to a particular drug, the compound can be administered prior to administration of the drug to avoid or ameliorate an allergic response to the drug. Alternatively, prophylactic administration can be applied to avoid the onset of symptoms in a patient diagnosed with the underlying disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffective dosages can be estimated initially from in vitro assays. For example, an initial dosage for use in animals can be formulated to achieve a circulating blood or serum concentration of active compound that is at or above an IC\n50 \nof the particular compound as measured in as in vitro assay. Calculating dosages to achieve such circulating blood or serum concentrations taking into account the bioavailability of the particular compound is well within the capabilities of skilled artisans. For guidance, the reader is referred to Fingl & Woodbury, “General Principles,” GOODMAN AND GILMAN'S THE PHARMACEUTICAL BASIS OF THERAPEUTICS, Chapter 1, pp. 1-46, latest edition, Pergamagon Press, and the references cited therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInitial dosages can also be estimated from in vivo data, such as animal models. Animal models useful for testing the efficacy of compounds to treat or prevent the various diseases described above are well-known in the art. Ordinarily skilled artisans can routinely adapt such information to determine dosages suitable for human administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage amounts will typically be in the range of from about 0.0001 or 0.001 or 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 100 mg/kg/day, but can be higher or lower, depending upon, among other factors, the activity of the compound, its bioavailability, the mode of administration, and various factors discussed above. Dosage amount and interval can be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the compound(s) which are sufficient to maintain therapeutic or prophylactic effect. For example, the compounds can be administered once per week, several times per week (e.g., every other day), once per day, or multiple times per day, depending upon, among other things, the mode of administration, the specific indication being treated, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. In cases of local administration or selective uptake, such as local topical administration, the effective local concentration of active compound(s) may not be related to plasma concentration. Skilled artisans will be able to optimize effective local dosages without undue experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the compound(s) will provide therapeutic or prophylactic benefit without causing substantial toxicity. Toxicity of the compound(s) can be determined using standard pharmaceutical procedures. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic (or prophylactic) effect is the therapeutic index. Compounds(s) that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe foregoing disclosure pertaining to the dosage requirements for the compounds of the invention is pertinent to dosages required for prodrugs, with the realization, apparent to the skilled artisan, that the amount of prodrug(s) administered will also depend upon a variety of factors, including, for example, the bioavailability of the particular prodrug(s) and the conversation rate and efficiency into active drug compound under the selected route of administration. Determination of an effective dosage of prodrug(s) for a particular use and mode of administration is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided are kits for administration of the compounds of the invention, prodrug thereof, or pharmaceutical formulations comprising the compound that may include a dosage amount of at least one compound or a composition comprising at least one compound, as disclosed herein. Kits may further comprise suitable packaging and/or instructions for use of the compound. Kits may also comprise a means for the delivery of the at least one compound or compositions comprising at least one compound of the invention, such as an inhaler, spray dispenser (e.g., nasal spray), syringe for injection, or pressure pack for capsules, tables, suppositories, or other device as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther types of kits provide the compound and reagents to prepare a composition for administration. The composition can be in a dry or lyophilized form or in a solution, particularly a sterile solution. When the composition is in a dry form, the reagent may comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent for preparing a liquid formulation. The kit may contain a device for administration or for dispensing the compositions, including, but not limited to, syringe, pipette, transdermal patch, or inhalant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kits may include other therapeutic compounds for use in conjunction with the compounds described herein. These compounds can be provided in a separate form or mixed with the compounds of the present invention. The kits will include appropriate instructions for preparation and administration of the composition, side effects of the compositions, and any other relevant information. The instructions can be in any suitable format, including, but not limited to, printed matter, videotape, computer readable disk, or optical disc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, this invention provides a kit comprising a compound selected from the compounds of the invention or a prodrug thereof, packaging, and instructions for use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, this invention provides a kit comprising the pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound selected from the compounds of the invention or a prodrug thereof and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent, preservative, stabilizer, or mixture thereof, packaging, and instructions for use. In another embodiment, kits for treating an individual who suffers from or is susceptible to the conditions described herein are provided, comprising a container comprising a dosage amount of a compound of this invention or composition, as disclosed herein, and instructions for use. The container can be any of those known in the art and appropriate for storage and delivery of oral, intravenous, topical, rectal, urethral, or inhaled formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKits may also be provided that contain sufficient dosages of the compounds or composition to provide effective treatment for an individual for an extended period, such as a week, 2 weeks, 3, weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, or 8 weeks or more.\n\n\n \nE. General Synthesis of the Compounds of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds and prodrugs of the invention can be synthesized via a variety of different synthetic routes using commercially available starting materials and/or starting materials prepared by conventional synthetic methods. It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the process described below, the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable protecting groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe exact identity of any protecting group(s) used will depend upon the identity of the functional group being protected, and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. Guidance for selecting appropriate protecting groups, as well as synthetic strategies for their attachment and removal, can be found, for example, in Greene & Wuts, PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS, 3d Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York (1999) and the references cited therein. Examples of functional groups include hydroxy, amino, mercapto and carboxylic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, “protecting group” refers to a group of atoms that, when attached to a reactive functional group in a molecule, mask, reduce or prevent the reactivity of the functional group. Typically, a protecting group can be selectively removed as desired during the course of a synthesis. Examples of protecting groups can be found in Greene and Wuts, as mentioned above, and, additionally, in Harrison et al., COMPENDIUM OF SYNTHETIC ORGANIC METHODS, Vols. 1-8, 1971-1996, John Wiley & Sons, NY. Representative amino protecting groups include, but are not limited to, formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (“CBZ”), tert-butoxycarbonyl (“Boc”), trimethylsilyl (“TMS”), 2-trimethylsilyl-ethanesulfonyl (“TES”), trityl and substituted trityl groups, allyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (“FMOC”), nitro-veratryloxycarbonyl (“NVOC”), and the like. Representative hydroxyl protecting groups include, but are not limited to, those where the hydroxyl group is either acylated to form acetate and benzoate esters or alkylated to form benzyl and trityl ethers, as well as alkyl ethers, tetrahydropyranyl ethers, trialkylsilyl ethers (e.g., TMS or TIPPS groups), aryl silyl ethers (e.g., triphenylsilyl ether), mixed alkyl and aryl substituted silyl ethers, and allyl ethers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following reaction Schemes illustrate methods to make compounds of the invention. It is understood that one of ordinary skill in the art would be able to make the compounds of the invention by similar methods or by methods known to one skilled in the art. In general, starting components may be obtained from sources such as Aldrich, or synthesized according to sources known to those of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., Smith and March, MARCH'S ADVANCED ORGANIC CHEMISTRY: REACTIONS, MECHANISMS, AND STRUCTURE, 5th edition (Wiley Interscience, New York)). Moreover, the various substituted groups (e.g., R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, p etc.) of the compounds of the invention may be attached to the starting components, intermediate components, and/or final products according to methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of exemplary synthetic routes that can be used to synthesize the compounds of the invention are described in Scheme I below. Specifically, compounds of formula I can be synthesized using the methods disclosed hereinbelow. These methods can be routinely adapted to synthesize the compounds and prodrugs described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one exemplary embodiment, various compounds of formula I can be synthesized from ester E as illustrated in Scheme I, below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Scheme I, the groups R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, and R\n7 \nare as defined herein, X is halo, and R′ and R″ are independently lower alkyl. The starting esters E can be purchased from commercial sources or prepared using standard techniques of organic chemistry. Typically, ester E is reacted with hydrazine hydrate to give hydrazide F under standard conditions. Hydrazide F is then converted to compound G by reacting with a halooxoacetate. Compound G is then cyclized to oxadiazole-2-carboxylate H via treatment with POCl\n3\n. The oxadiazole-2-carboxylate H is then reacted with suitable amines to give compounds J. Compound J is then reacted with suitable amines to give compounds of formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds E can be purchased from commercial sources or prepared using standard techniques of organic chemistry. See Vogel, 1989, PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, Addison Wesley Longman, Ltd. and John Wiley & Sons, Inc. In each of the above recited steps, the product may be recovered by conventional methods such as evaporation, chromatography, precipitation, crystallization, and the like or, alternatively, used in the next step without purification and/or isolation. The reactions depicted in Scheme I may proceed more quickly when the reaction solutions are rapidly heated by, e.g., a microwave.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSkilled artisans will recognize that in some instances, compounds E, F, G, H, and J may include functional groups that require protection during synthesis. The exact identity of any protecting group(s) used will depend upon the identity of the functional group being protected, and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. Guidance for selecting appropriate protecting groups, as well as synthetic strategies for their attachment and removal, can be found, for example, in Greene & Wuts, PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS, 3d Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York (1999) and the references cited therein (hereinafter “Greene & Wuts”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are intended to illustrate the various embodiments of this invention.\n\n\n \nExamples\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention is further understood by reference to the following examples, which are intended to be purely exemplary of the invention.

On the day before assay 25,000 T84 cells per well are plated into standard black walled, clear bottom 384-well assay plates in standard growth medium consisting of DMEM:F12 with 10% FBS and incubated overnight. On the day of the assay the plates are washed using a standard assay buffer (HBSS with 10 mM Hepes) and incubated for 15 minutes in serum free cell culture medium before the addition of a commercially available membrane potential sensitive fluorescent dye (FLIPR Red membrane potential dye, Molecular Devices Corporation). T84 cells are incubated with the FLIPR Red membrane potential dye for 45 minutes in the presence and absence of test compound before being transferred to a commercially available fluorescence imaging plate reader (FLIPR384, Molecular Devices Corporation). Fluorescence levels are monitored continuously every second for 150 seconds; after an initial 10 second baseline, CFTR channel activity is stimulated through the addition of 10 μM forskolin in the presence of 100 μM of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor iso-butyl-methylxanthine (IBMX). Addition of the forskolin leads to the activation of intracellular adenylyl cylase 1, elevating cAMP levels and results in the phosphorylation and opening of CFTR anion channels. CFTR channel opening causes chloride ion efflux and subsequent depolarization of the cells, which is measured by an increase in fluorescence. CFTR inhibitor compounds prevent cell depolarization and the associated increase in fluorescence.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nFRT Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nFisher Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells stably co-expressing wildtype human CFTR and a reporter protein such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or a mutant such as the yellow fluorescent protein-based Cl\n31\n/I\n−\n halide sensor e.g. YFP-H148Q can be cultured on 96-well plates as described in Gruenert (2004), supra or Ma et al. (2002) J. Clin. Invest. 110:1651-1658. Following a 48 hour incubation confluent FRT-CFTR-YFP-H148Q cells in 96-well plates are washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then CFTR halide conductance is activated by incubation for 5 minutes with a cocktail containing 5 μM, forskolin, 25 μM apigenin and 100 μM isobutylmethyl-xanthine (IBMX). Test compounds at a final concentration of 10 μM and 20 μM are added five minutes prior to assay of iodide influx in which cells are exposed to a 100 mM inwardly-directed iodide gradient. Baseline YFP fluorescence is recorded for two seconds followed by 12 seconds of continuous recording of fluorescence after rapid addition of the I\n−\n containing solution to create a I\n−\n gradient. Initial rates of I\n−\n influx can be computed from the time course of decreasing fluorescence after the I\n−\n gradient as known to those skilled in the art and described in Yang et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem.: 35079-35085.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivity of the CFTR channel can also be measured directly using electrophysiological methods. An example protocol for measuring CFTR current is described as whole cell patch clamp method. As an illustration, recordings are conducted at room temperature (−21° C.) using a HEKA EPC-10 amplifier. Electrodes are fabricated from 1.7 mm capillary glass with resistances between 2 and 3 MΩ using a Sutter P-97 puller. For recording the CFTR channels, the extracellular solution can contain (in mM) 150 NaCl, 1 CaCl\n2\n, 1 MgCl\n2\n, 10 glucose, 10 mannitol, and 10 TES (pH 7.4), and the intracellular (pipette) solution can contain 120 CsCl, MgCl\n2\n, 10 TEA-Cl, 0.5 EGTA, 1 Mg-ATP and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CFTR channels are activated by forskoin (5 μM) in the extracellular solution. The cells are held at a potential of 0 mV and currents are recorded by a voltage ramp protocol from −120 mV to +80 mV over 500 ms every 10 seconds. No leak subtraction was employed. Compounds are superfused to individual cells using a Biologic MEV-9/EVH-9 rapid perfusion system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the above compounds were active in at least one of these assays. Activity was assessed by the compounds exhibiting an IC\n50 \nof less than 30 μM in the T84 assay, a greater than 30% inhibition at 20 μM in the FRT assay, and/or a greater than 35% inhibition at 50 μM in a T84 assay, provided that the compound does not have an IC\n50 \ngreater than 30 μM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IC\n50 \nvalue of the compounds described herein is as provided in Table 4 below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound No.\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(μm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n7.14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n6.69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n7.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n12.93\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n7.74\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n12.80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn Vivo Study\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n \n \n \nFor in vivo studies for the treatment of diarrhea, mice (CD1 strain, approximately 25 g) were deprived of food for at least 20 hours and anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (16 mg/kg) prior to surgery. Anesthesia was maintained as needed. Body temperature was maintained using a heated operating table. The abdominal area was shaved and disinfected with 70% alcohol swabs. An incision was made on the abdomen for exposure of the small intestine. Following the abdominal incision two different closely-spaced locations of the small intestine were isolated and looping was performed. Loop 1 started around 6 cm from the junction of stomach and duodenum. Loop 1 and Loop 2 were intestinal loops of around 25 mm in length with inter-loop space of around 5-10 mm. One hundred microliters of the PBS pH 8.5 or the PBS pH 8.5 containing 2.0 μg cholera toxin (CTX) (with or without test article) was injected into each loop. The abdominal incision was then closed with sutures and mice were allowed to recover from anesthesia. During this recovery period, close monitoring was performed. At 4 hours after the injection of the test article or control article dose formulation, the mice were euthanized via CO\n2 \ninhalation plus diaphragm severance, the intestinal loops were exteriorized, and loop length and loop weight were measured after removal of mesentery and connective tissue to quantify the net fluid secretion (measured as g/cm of loop).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that while the invention has been described in conjunction with the above embodiments, that the foregoing description and examples are intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the invention. Other aspects, advantages and modifications within the scope of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains."

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present application claims the benefit of prior provisional application, U.S. Ser. No. 61/211,800.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to absorbable, crystalline, polyether-ester-urethane-based compositions that can be delivered to the luminal wall of a body cavity or conduit of the gastrointestinal tract, urinogenital or vascular systems to form a bioactive, adhering liner upon contacting the respective wet luminal surface, wherein the bioactivity of the liner is associated with the controlled release of at least one bioactive agent selected from the group consisting of antimicrobial, antiviral, immunosuppressant, antineoplastic, and anti-inflammatory agents. The bioactive luminal liners are applicable for use in treating vaginal and esophageal fungal infections and further in preventing vascular restenosis following angioplasty and treating urinogenital infections.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nPolyurethanes represent a main class of synthetic elastomers employed for long-term, medical implants as they present tunable chemical properties, excellent mechanical properties, good blood compatibility, and also can be designed to degrade in biological environments [A. Rechichi et al., \nJ. Biomed. Mater. Res., \n84-A, 847 (2008)]. More specifically, polyether-urethane (PEU) and polyether-urethane-urea (PEUU) elastomers have long been considered ideal for use in many implanted devices, in spite of occasionally cited drawbacks [M. A. Schubert et al., \nJ. Biomed. Mater. Res., \n35, 319 (1997); B. Ward et al., \nJ. Biomed. Mater. Res., \n77-A, 380 (2008)]. Of the cited drawbacks are those associated with (1) the generation of aromatic diamines, which are considered to be toxic upon degradation of segmented copolymers made using aromatic diisocyanates for interlinking; (2) chain degradation due to oxidation or radiation degradation of the polyether component of segmented copolymers, and particularly those which encounter frequent mechanical stresses in the biological environment; and (3) chemical degradation in chemically and mechanically hostile biological environments of the urethane links of segmented copolymers and particularly those comprising reactive aromatic urethane linkages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid solventless, complex polymeric compositions, which thermoset at ambient temperatures through additional polymerization of a two-component system, wherein the first component comprises amine or acrylate-terminated polyurethanes or polyurethane-ureas and the second component comprises di- or polyacrylates have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,742,147. However, the prior art is virtually silent on self-standing PEU and PEUU liquid solventless compositions for use in pharmaceutical formulations and/or medical devices. Similarly, the prior art on polyether-urethanes is practically silent on hydroswellable (or water-swellable) systems, in spite of the fact that it addresses elastomeric, segmented, hydrophilic polyether-urethane-based, lubricious coating compositions based on aromatic diisocyanate and polyethylene glycol (U.S. Pat. No. 4,990,357)—it did not suggest a self-standing material for medical device applications. This prompted a study subject of a recent disclosure by one inventor of the instant invention and his coworkers (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/380,391). The latter disclosure dealt in general with hydroswellable, absorbable and non-absorbable, aliphatic, segmented polyurethanes and polyurethane-urea capable of swelling in the biological environment with associated increase in volume of at least 3 percent have more than one type of segments, including those derived from polyethylene glycol and the molecular chains are structurally tailored to allow the use of corresponding formulations and medical devices as carriers for bioactive agents, rheological modifiers of cyanoacrylate-based tissue adhesives, as protective devices for repairing defective or diseased components of articulating joints and their cartilage, and scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost pertinent to the instant invention are certain composition and formulations described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/380,391, which can be used as (1) injectable gel-forming liquid formulations for the controlled delivery of bioactive agents for treating periodontitis, nail infections, bone infections, a variety of bacterial and fungal infections, and different forms of cancers, and (2) in situ-forming, extrudable luminal liner for the controlled drug delivery at the luminal wall of vaginal canals and blood vessels. However, the use of these compositions as covers or liners on the luminal wall of vaginal canals, esophagi, and blood vessels may be less than optimum since the teaching of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/380,391 deals mostly with hydroswellable amorphous coatings, which may undergo excessive deformation and creep in presence of low levels of shear stresses. This prompted the study, subject of the present invention, which relates to a new class of absorbable crystalline polyether-ester-urethane-based compositions, which represent a substantial improvement over their amorphous analogs of the prior art, in terms of providing a set of balanced properties that support hydroformation into tissue-adhering liners that are not only resilient, but also resist deformation in the presence of shear forces.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention is directed to a bioactive hydroforming luminal liner composition comprising at least one absorbable crystalline amphiphilic polyether-ester-urethane having a molecular weight of at least 10 kDa, preferably at least 20 kDa, more preferably at least 35 kDa, most preferably at least 50 kDa, and a heat of fusion exceeding 5 J/g, preferably exceeding 10 J/g, more preferably exceeding 20 J/g, most preferably exceeding 30 J/g, a liquid derivative of a polyether glycol and at least one bioactive agent selected from the group consisting of antimicrobial, antiretroviral, antiviral, antiretroviral, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, immunosuppressing, antineoplastic, and anesthetic agents, wherein the at least one absorbable crystalline polyether-ester-urethane is the reaction product of at least one polyalkylene glycol, end-grafted with at least one cyclic monomer selected from the group consisting of ε-caprolactone, p-dioxanone, a lactide, glycolide, 1,5dioxapan-2-one, trimethylene carbonate, and a morpholinedione.

The respective antibacterial formulation can be used for treating vaginal and esophageal bacterial infections in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA clinically important aspect of this invention deals with the use of the subject polymers as carriers for treating (a) steroid-responsive dermatitis using hydrocortisone or triamcinolone; (b) septic arthritis and osteomyelitis using vancomycin or methylprednisolone; and (c) vaginal, esophageal or nail infection using ketoconazole, miconazole, terbinafine or voriconazole.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom a technological perspective, the antifungal and antibacterial formulation, subject of this invention, further include a method of preparation, sterilization, and packaging entailing the steps of (a) dissolving the crystalline polyether-ester-urethane in the liquid derivative of a polyether glycol; (b) heat-sterilizing the liquid solution; (c) mixing the sterilized liquid solution with the antifungal or antibacterial agent, under aseptic conditions; (d) transferring an aliquot of active formulation from step “c” to a pre-sterilized plastic tubular housing of the applicator and securing the applicator in the housing; (e) placing the assembled applicator kit from step “d” in a sealable clear plastic pouch; and (f) heat-sealing the plastic pouch from step “e.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom a clinical perspective, the intravaginal application of the antifungal and antibacterial formulation, subject of this invention requires an applicator kit for delivering the active formulation comprising a solid applicator in a tubular housing of slightly larger diameter wherein the applicator has clockwise, helical grooves 2 mm in width and depth, both the applicator and tubular housing are threaded at their ends to allow secure assembling of the kit.

Meanwhile, a method of preparation, sterilization, and packaging the catheter components of the applicator kit, entailing the steps of (a) dissolving the crystalline polyether-ester-urethane in the liquid derivative of a polyether glycol; (b) heat-sterilizing the liquid solution; (c) mixing the sterilized liquid solution with the bioactive agent or agents under aseptic conditions; (d) transferring an aliquot of the active formulation from step “c” into the blind end of the outside catheter; (e) inserting the inflatable inner catheter inside the outer one up to the point preceding the holed zone of the blind catheter; and (f) incorporating the two-catheter kit into a modified deployment kit for endovascular stents.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a major aspect the present invention is directed to the treatment of vaginal and esophageal candidiasis. Vaginal Candidiasis (VC) is a common medical problem in women and is associated with discomfort, particularly due to a copious discharge, which is often accompanied by odor. Currently available treatments of yeast infection include (1) a systemic oral administration therapy; (2) use of topical creams; and (3) use of intravaginal suppositories which release the drug after melting or dissolving in the vagina. However, the systemic administration can lead to drug toxicity, while all other currently used forms for intravaginal administration are subject to uncontrolled leakage of the drug during the vaginal discharge, creating unsanitary conditions and discomfort while resulting in unpredictable bioavailability of the drug. Esophageal candidiasis (EC) is another form of fungal infection caused in most cases by a candida species and results in sore throat and difficulty in swallowing. This infection is becoming more serious with the growing number of HIV patients who are highly susceptible to yeast infection. The orally administered treatment options of EC using oral formulations are particularly effective in HIV patients. However, there have been concerns about the clinical relapse in these patients, which is dependent upon the degree of immunosuppression apart from the potential hepatotoxicity associated with high or prolonged doses of orally administered drugs. Clinical shortcomings of the current treatments of VC and EC evoked the need to explore the development of topically administered drug delivery systems that are not affected by the aqueous vaginal discharge in the vagina and food transport in the esophagus, in part because of its good adhesion to the vaginal and esophageal linings to provide predictably modulated release of the drug. The need for such a novel drug delivery system prompted the pursuit of the study, subject of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the invention is directed to a new class of polyether-ester-urethane-based compositions comprising at least one crystalline amphiphilic absorbable polyether-ester-urethane and at least one bioactive agent dissolved in a liquid derivative of a polyalkylene glycol. The chemical composition of the polyether-ester-urethane (PEEU), polyalkylene glycol derivative, and the bioactive agents and their relative concentrations in these compositions can be controlled to achieve balanced properties so as to (1) provide the proper viscosity to allow their facile delivery to the application site using existing deployment equipment or modifications thereof; (2) allow a timely hydroformation (i.e., phase separation in the presence of an aqueous environment, as in biological sites) into tissue adhering liner (or cover) that is biomechanically compatible with the lining of body cavities or canals as in the case of the vagina, esophagus, and blood vessels—hydroformation is effected by the migration of the polymeric solvent (with simultaneous phase separation of the PEEU to form a liner) and liner adhesion to the interior surface of the luminal wall is promoted by the highly hydrophilic polyether component of the polyether-ester-urethane; (3) form a crystalline liner exhibiting resilience and controlled dimensional stability by virtue of the segmented amphiphilic nature of the PEEU chain and the presence of quasi-crosslinks (presented by the crystalline fraction and association of the urethane segments), respectively; (4) be loaded with at least one type of bioactive agent, depending on the intended use of the bioactive compositions by virtue of having components which can be selected to dissolve or disperse a broad range of bioactive agents exhibiting different solubility parameters; and (5) allow achieving controllable release profiles of the different bioactive agents at the application sites by virtue of having PEEU compositions capable of having variable hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratios to be in concert with the desired modes of drug release. Further illustrations of the present invention are provided by the following examples:\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nSynthesis and Characterization of an Absorbable, Crystalline Polyether-ester-Urethane (C-PU): General Method\n\n\n \n \n \nFor an initial charge, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-1000) (M\nw\n=1000 Da) was added to a 250 mL, 2-neck, round-bottom flask. The contents were heated at 100° C. under reduced pressure for 1 hour and then purged with dry nitrogen. A mechanical stir rod was installed with a Teflon bearing assembly and the contents were heated to 100° C.-110° C. while stirring. A second charge, consisting of 1-lactide and glycolide was added and stirred at 120 RPM until the reaction mixture achieved one phase. A third charge, Tin(II) 2-ethyl hexanoate, was then added in a 0.2M solution in toluene. The reaction solution was then heated at 100° C. until near complete monomer conversion was achieved. The polymer was then cooled to 100° C. and diisocyanatohexane was added. The solution was then stirred at 100° C. for at least one hour until the isocyanate reacted completely. After interlinking the polymer was heated at 100° C. for 2.5-3.0 hours and then was dissolved at 55-67° C. in tetrahydrofuran (THF). After dissolution of the polymer in the THF, 2-propanol was added to react with any isocyanate end-groups and the solution was stirred for 1 hour. The resulting polymer was isolated by evaporating the solvent under reduced pressure and characterized for identity (IR), molecular weight (GPC), and thermal properties (DSC).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\nSynthesis and Characterization of Two Typical Absorbable, Crystalline Polyether-Ester-Urethanes, C-PU-1 and C-PU-2\n\n\n \n \n \nPoly-ester-urethanes C-PU-1 and C-PU-2 were prepared using the method of Example 1. The poly(ethylene glycol) used in C-PU-1 and C-PU-2 had a molecular weight of 1000 Dalton. For Poly-ester-urethanes C-PU-1 and C-PU-2, 0.025 and 0.025 moles of poly(ethylene glycol), 0.46 and 0.48 moles of 1-lactide, 0.08 and 0.05 moles of glycolide, 6.71×10\n−5 \nand 6.64×10\n−5 \nmoles of tin(II) 2-ethyl hexanoate, and 0.017 and 0.017 moles of 1,6-diisocyanatohexane were used, respectively. Polymers C-PU-1 and C-PU-2 were characterized for molecular weight by GPC using dichloromethane as the mobile phase which resulted in M\nn \nof 18 and 22 kDa, M\nw \nof 38 and 133 kDa, Mp of 24 and 63 kDa, and PDI of 2.2 and 6.1, respectively. Six mg samples of C-PU-1 and C-PU-2 were annealed in 5 mL glass vials submerged in a 70° C. oil bath for 1.75 hours, equilibrated in the DSC apparatus for 5 minutes at 20° C. upon removal from the bath, and heated to 220° C. at a rate of 20° C./min to determine the thermal properties. This resulted in melting temperatures/heats of fusion (T\nm\n,/ΔH) of 90.9° C./7.9 J/g and 92.5° C./16.3 J/g for C-PU-1 and C-PU-2 respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that modifications and variations may be utilized without departing from the principles and scope of the invention, as those skilled in the art will readily understand. Accordingly, such modifications may be practiced within the scope of the following claims. Moreover, Applicant hereby discloses all subranges of all ranges disclosed herein. These subranges are also useful in carrying out the present invention."

Description\n\n\n\n\n ANTHRACYCLINE DERIVATIVE CONJUGATES, PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND THEIR USE AS ANTITUMOR COMPOUNDS\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n[0001] This non-provisional application claims the benefit under 35 USC § 119(e) of\n\n\nU.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/080,944 filed on 15 July 2008, which is incorporated by reference in entirety.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0002] The present invention relates to conjugates of therapeutically useful anthracyclines with carriers such as polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, proteins or peptides of natural or synthetic origin; methods for their preparation, pharmaceutical composition containing them and use thereof in treating certain mammalian tumors. The invention also relates to new anthracycline derivatives and to their preparation.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0003] Anthracyclines are antibiotic compounds that exhibit cytotoxic activity.\n\n\nStudies have indicated that anthracyclines may operate to kill cells by a number of different mechanisms including: 1) intercalation of the drug molecules into the DNA of the cell thereby inhibiting DNA-dependent nucleic acid synthesis; 2) production by the drug of free radicals which then react with cellular macromolecules to cause damage to the cells or 3) interactions of the drug molecules with the cell membrane [see, e.g., C. Peterson et al.,\" Transport And Storage Of Anthracycline In Experimental Systems And Human Leukemia\" in Anthracvcline Antibiotics In Cancer Therapy; N.R. Bachur, \"Free Radical Damage\" id. at pp.97-102]. Because of their cytotoxic potential anthracyclines have been used in the treatment of numerous cancers such as leukemia, breast carcinoma, lung carcinoma, ovarian adenocarcinoma and sarcomas [see e.g., P. H- Wiernik, in Anthracvcline: Current Status And New Developments p 11]. Commonly used anthracyclines include doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin and daunomycin.\n\n\n[0004] In the recent years many new highly cytotoxic anthracyclines have been synthesized. For example nemorubicin, the anthracycline derivative bearing a substituted morpholino ring linked to the C-3 ' position of the sugar moiety has shown promising antitumor activity on experimental murine tumors [see: J. W. Lown, Bioactive Molecules (1988) vol 6:55-101] and is currently under clinical phase trials for the treatment of \n\n [0005] hepatocellular carcinoma [see: C. Sessa, O. Valota, C. Geroni, Cardiovascular\n\n\nToxicology (2007) 7(2):75-79]. Although these compounds may be useful in the treatment of neoplasm and other disease states wherein a selected cell population is sought to be eliminated, their therapeutic efficacy is often limited by the dose-dependent toxicity associated with their administration.\n\n\n[0006] Attempts to improve the therapeutic effect of these compounds have been tried by linking the anthracycline to antibodies or to different carriers. An example of an anthracycline conjugated with antibodies is reported, for example, in EP 0328147 to Bristol Myers, in WO 9202255 to Farmitalia Carlo Erba or in US 5776458 to Pharmacia & Upjohn. [0007] Other interesting tricyclic morpholino anthracycline derivatives, characterized by high activity, were described and claimed in the International patent application WO 98/02446 (1997) of M. Caruso et al. . Among these derivatives, a particularly active compound is PNU-159682, described by Quintieri, L., Geroni, C. et al. in Clinical Cancer Research (2005) 11(4): 1608-1617. Compound PNU-159682 has the formula (IIA) as defined herein below, and the following chemical names:\n\n\n[0008] 5,12-naphthacenedione, 7,8,9, 10-tetrahydro-6,8, 11 -trihydroxy-8-\n\n\n(hydroxyacetyl)-1-methoxy-10-[[(lS,3R,4aS,9S,9aR,10aS)-octahydro-9-methoxy-1-methyl- 1H-pyrano[4',3':4,5]oxazolo[2,3-c][1,4]oxazin-3-yl]oxy]-, (8S,10S)- (9CI); [0009] 5, 12-naphthacenedione, 7,8,9, 10-tetrahydro-6,8, 11 -trihydroxy-8-\n\n\n(hydroxyacetyl)- 1 -methoxy- 10-[(octahydro-9-methoxy- 1 -methyl- 1 H- pyrano[4',3':4,5]oxazolo[2,3-c][1,4]oxazin-3-yl)oxy]-, [IS-\n\n\n[ 1 α,3 β(8R*, 10R*),4aβ,9α,9aα, 1 Oaβ]] or (8S, 105)-6,8, 11 -trihydroxy-8-(hydroxyacetyl)- 1 - methoxy- 10- { [(lS,3R,4aS,9S,9aR, 10aS)-9-methoxy- 1 -methyloctahydro- IH- pyrano[4',3':4,5][1,3]oxazolo[2,3-c][1,4]oxazin-3-yl]oxy}-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrotetracene-5,12- dione.\n\n\n[0010] Antibody therapy has been established for the targeted treatment of patients with cancer, immunological and angiogenic disorders (Carter, P. (2006) Nature Reviews Immunology 6:343-357). The use of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), i.e. immunoconjugates, for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents, i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer, targets delivery of the drug moiety to tumors, and intracellular accumulation therein, whereas systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated (Xie et al (2006) Expert. Opin. Biol. Ther. 6(3):281-291; Kovtun et al (2006) Cancer Res. 66(6):3214-3121; Law et al (2006) Cancer \n\n Res. 66(4):2328-2337; Wu et al (2005) Nature Biotech. 23(9): 1137-1145; Lambert J. (2005) Current Opin. in Pharmacol. 5:543-549; Hamann P. (2005) Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 15(9): 1087-1103; Payne, G. (2003) Cancer Cell 3:207-212; Trail et al (2003) Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 52:328-337; Syrigos and Epenetos (1999) Anticancer Research 19:605-614). Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Efforts to design and refine ADC have focused on the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as drug mechanism of action, drug-linking, drug/antibody ratio (loading), and drug-releasing properties (McDonagh (2006) Protein Eng. Design & SeL; Doronina et al (2006) Bioconj. Chem. 17: 114-124; Erickson et al (2006) Cancer Res. 66(8): 1-8; Sanderson et al (2005) Clin. Cancer Res. 11 :843-852; Jeffrey et al (2005) J. Med. Chem. 48: 1344-1358; Hamblett et al (2004) Clin. Cancer Res. 10:7063-7070). Drug moieties may impart their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding, DNA binding, or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.\n\n\n[0011] The anthracycline analog, doxorubicin (ADRIAMYCIN®) is thought to interact with DNA by intercalation and inhibition of the progression of the enzyme topoisomerase II, which unwinds DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. Doxorubicin and daunorubicin (DAUNOMYCIN) are prototype cytotoxic natural product anthracycline chemotherapeutics (Sessa et al (2007) Cardiovasc. Toxicol. 7:75-79). Immunoconjugates and prodrugs of daunorubicin and doxorubicin have been prepared and studied (Kratz et al (2006) Current Med. Chem. 13:477-523; Jeffrey et al (2006) Bioorganic & Med. Chem. Letters 16:358-362; Torgov et al (2005) Bioconj. Chem. 16:717-721; Nagy et al (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 97:829-834; Dubowchik et al (2002) Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Letters 12: 1529-1532; King et al (2002) J. Med. Chem. 45:4336-4343; US 6630579). The antibody-drug conjugate BR96-doxorubicin reacts specifically with the tumor-associated antigen Lewis-Y and has been evaluated in phase I and II studies (Saleh et al (2000) J. Clin. Oncology 18:2282-2292; Ajani et al (2000) Cancer Jour. 6:78-81; Tolcher et al (1999) J. Clin. Oncology 17:478-484).\n\n\n[0012] Morpholino analogs of doxorubicin and daunorubicin, formed by cyclization on the glycoside amino group, have greater potency (Acton et al (1984) J. Med. Chem. 638- 645; US 4464529; US 4672057; US 5304687). Nemorubicin is a semisynthetic analog of doxorubicin with a 2-methoxymorpholino group on the glycoside amino of doxorubicin and \n\n has been under clinical evaluation (Grandi et al (1990) Cancer Treat.

(Janeway, C, Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001) Immuno Biology, 5th Ed., Garland Publishing, New York). A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites, also called epitopes, recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus, one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody. An antibody includes a full- length immunoglobulin molecule or an immunologically active portion of a full-length immunoglobulin molecule, i.e., a molecule that contains an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen of a target of interest or part thereof, such targets including but not limited to, cancer cell or cells that produce autoimmune antibodies associated with an autoimmune disease. The immunoglobulin can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, and IgA), class (e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species, including human, murine, or rabbit origin.\n\n\n[0084] \"Antibody fragments\" comprise a portion of a full length antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, CDR (complementary determining region), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens or microbial antigens, single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.\n\n\n[0085] The term \"monoclonal antibody\" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that \n\n may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier \"monoclonal\" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al (1975) Nature 256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, US 4816567). The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al (1991) Nature, 352:624-628; Marks et al (1991) J. MoI. Biol., 222:581-597.\n\n\n[0086] The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \"chimeric\" antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (US 4816567; and Morrison et al (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851-6855). Chimeric antibodies include \"primatized\" antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g., Old World Monkey or Ape) and human constant region sequences. [0087] An \"intact antibody\" herein is one comprising a VL and VH domains, as well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CHl, CH2 and CH3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof. The intact antibody may have one or more \"effector functions\" which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include CIq binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; and down regulation of cell surface receptors such as B cell receptor and BCR. \n\n [0088] Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, intact antibodies can be assigned to different \"classes.\" There are five major classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into \"subclasses\" (isotypes), e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called α, δ, ε, γ, and μ, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.\n\n\n[0089] An \"ErbB receptor\" is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase which belongs to the\n\n\nErbB receptor family which are important mediators of cell growth, differentiation and survival. The ErbB receptor family includes four distinct members including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbBl, HERl), HER2 (ErbB2 or pl85\"\ne\n\"), HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4 or tyro2). The ErbB receptor will generally comprise an extracellular domain, which may bind an ErbB ligand; a lipophilic transmembrane domain; a conserved intracellular tyrosine kinase domain; and a carboxyl-terminal signaling domain harboring several tyrosine residues which can be phosphorylated. The ErbB receptor may be a \"native sequence\" ErbB receptor or an \"amino acid sequence variant\" thereof. The ErbB receptor may be native sequence human ErbB receptor. Accordingly, a \"member of the ErbB receptor family\" is EGFR (ErbBl), ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4 or any other ErbB receptor currently known or to be identified in the future. Sequence identity screening has resulted in the identification of two other ErbB receptor family members; ErbB3 (US 5183884; US 5480968; Kraus et al (1989) PNAS (USA) 86:9193-9197) and ErbB4 (EP 599274; Plowman et al (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90: 1746-1750; and Plowman et al (1993) Nature 366:473-475). Both of these receptors display increased expression on at least some breast cancer cell lines. Anti- ErbB2 antibodies have been characterized (US 5677171; US 5821337; US 6054297; US 6165464; US 6407213; US 6719971; US 6800738; Fendly et al (1990) Cancer Research 50: 1550-1558; Kotts et al.

(1996) Cancer Research 56: 1457-1465; and Schaefer et al. (1997) Oncogene 15: 1385- 1394. [0090] \"Humanized\" forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies are chimeric \n\n antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non- human immunoglobulin and all, or substantially all, of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin (Jones et al (1986) Nature, 321:522-525; Riechmann et al (1988) Nature 332:323-329; and Presta, (1992) Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 2:593-596). Humanized anti-ErbB2 antibodies include huMAb4D5-l, huMAb4D5-2, huMAb4D5-3, huMAb4D5-4, huMAb4D5- 5, huMAb4D5-6, huMAb4D5-7 and huMAb4D5-8 (HERCEPTIN®, trastuzumab) as described in Table 3 of US 5821337 expressly incorporated herein by reference; humanized 520C9 (WO 93/21319) and humanized 2C4 antibodies.\n\n\n[0091] The terms \"treat\" and \"treatment\" refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological change or disorder, such as the development or spread of cancer. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. \"Treatment\" can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.\n\n\n[0092] A \"disorder\" is any condition that would benefit from treatment of the present invention. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Non-limiting examples \n\n of disorders to be treated herein include benign and malignant tumors; leukemia and lymphoid malignancies, in particular breast, ovarian, stomach, endometrial, salivary gland, lung, kidney, colon, thyroid, pancreatic, prostate or bladder cancer; neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic and other glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, stromal and blastocoelic disorders; and inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic disorders. An exemplary disorder to be treated in accordance with the present invention is a solid, malignant tumor. [0093] The term \"therapeutically effective amount\" refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat a disease or disorder in a mammal. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may: (i) reduce the number of cancer cells; (ii) reduce the tumor size; (iii) inhibit, retard, slow to some extent and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; (iv) inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; (v) inhibit tumor growth; and/or (vi) relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. In animal models, efficacy may be assessed by physical measurements of the tumor during the course following administration of the ADC, and by determining partial and complete remission of tumor. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and/or determining the response rate (RR). [0094] The term \"bioavailability\" refers to the systemic availability (i.e., blood/plasma levels) of a given amount of drug administered to a patient. Bioavailability is an absolute term that indicates measurement of both the time (rate) and total amount (extent) of drug that reaches the general circulation from an administered dosage form. [0095] The terms \"cancer\" and \"cancerous\" refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. A \"tumor\" comprises one or more cancerous cells. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g., epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (\"NSCLC\"), adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal \n\n carcinoma, penile carcinoma, as well as head and neck cancer.\n\n\n[0096] An \"ErbB-expressing cancer\" is one comprising cells which have ErbB protein present at their cell surface. An \"ErbB2-expressing cancer\" is one which produces sufficient levels of ErbB2 at the surface of cells thereof, such that an anti-ErbB2 antibody can bind thereto and have a therapeutic effect with respect to the cancer. [0097] A cancer which \"overexpresses\" a receptor, e.g. an ErbB receptor, is one which has significantly higher levels of the receptor, such as ErbB2, at the cell surface thereof, compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type. Such overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or by increased transcription or translation. Receptor overexpression may be determined in a diagnostic or prognostic assay by evaluating increased levels of the receptor protein present on the surface of a cell (e.g., via an immunohistochemistry assay; 1HC). Alternatively, or additionally, one may measure levels of receptor-encoding nucleic acid in the cell, e.g., via fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH; see WO 98/45479), southern blotting, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, such as real time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR). Overexpression of the receptor ligand, may be determined diagnostically by evaluating levels of the ligand (or nucleic acid encoding it) in the patient, e.g., in a tumor biopsy or by various diagnostic assays such as the 1HC, FISH, southern blotting, PCR or in vivo assays described above. One may also study receptor overexpression by measuring a shed antigen (e.g., ErbB extracellular domain) in a biological fluid such as serum (see, e.g., US 4933294; WO 91/05264; US 5401638; and Sias et al (1990) J. Immunol. Methods 132: 73-80). Aside from the above assays, various other in vivo assays are available to the skilled practitioner. For example, one may expose cells within the body of the patient to an antibody which is optionally labeled with a detectable label, e.g., a radioactive isotope, and binding of the antibody to cells in the patient can be evaluated, e.g., by external scanning for radioactivity or by analyzing a biopsy taken from a patient previously exposed to the antibody.\n\n\n[0098] The term \"cytotoxic agent\" as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g., \n211\nAt, \n131\nI, \n125\n1, \n90\nY, \n186\nRe, \n188\nRe, \n153\nSm, \n212\nBi, \n32\nP, \n6\n°C, and radioactive isotopes of Lu), chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including synthetic analogs and derivatives thereof.\n\n\n[0099] A \"chemotherapeutic agent\" is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer, regardless of mechanism of action. Classes of chemotherapeutic agents include, but \n\n are not limited to: alkyating agents, antimetabolites, spindle poison plant alkaloids, cytoxic/antitumor antibiotics, topoisomerase inhibitors, antibodies, photosensitizers, and kinase inhibitors. Chemotherapeutic agents include compounds used in \"targeted therapy\" and conventional chemotherapy.

Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane -polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or \n\n (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \"racemic mixture\" and \"racemate\" refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.

A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counterion. The counterion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and/or one or more counterion. [0125] \"Pharmaceutically acceptable solvate\" refers to an association of one or more solvent molecules and an ADC. Examples of solvents that form pharmaceutically acceptable solvates include, but are not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine.\n\n\nANTHRACYCLΓNE DERIVATIVES AND ANTHRACYCLΓNE DERIVATIVE CONJUGATES\n\n\n[0126] As stated before, in a first aspect the present invention relates to conjugates of an anthracycline derivative of the formula (I):\n\n\n[Ant-L-Z-]\nm\n -T (I) \n\n [0127] wherein Ant, L, Z, m and T are as above defined, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n[0128] In a second aspect, there are provided anthracycline derivatives of the formula\n\n\n(T)\n\n\nAnt-L-Z-0 (I')\n\n\n[0129] wherein Ant, L and Z are as above defined, and Q is a hydrogen atom, a Ci-C\n6\n alkyl, C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkyl, phenyl or benzyl group, or a pharmaceutically salt thereof.

The linker is a bifunctional or multifunctional moiety which can be used to link one or more drug moiety (D) and an antibody unit (Ab) to form antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of formula Ic. The linker (L) may be stable outside a cell, i.e. extracellular, or it may be cleavable by enzymatic activity, hydrolysis, or other metabolic conditions. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) can be conveniently prepared using a linker having reactive functionality for binding to the drug moiety and to the antibody. A cysteine thiol, or an amine, e.g. N-terminus or amino acid side chain such as lysine, of the antibody (Ab) can form a bond with a functional group of a linker or spacer reagent, drug moiety (D) or drug-linker reagent (D-L).\n\n\n[0188] Many positions on anthracycline derivative compounds may be useful as the linkage position, depending upon the type of linkage. For example, ester, amide, thioamide,, thiocarbamate, or carbamate linkages may be formed from the hydroxyl group of the hydroxymethyl ketone at C 14; ketal and hydrazone linkages may be formed from the C 13 carbonyl group on the drug moiety; amide, carbamate, and urea linkages may be formed from an amino group on the drug moiety D; and various alkyl, ether, thioether, disulfide, and acyl linkages may be formed from the phenyl and aryl rings on the drug moiety by Friedel-Crafts type alkylation and acylation reactions. [0189] The linkers and spacers are preferably stable extracellularly. Before transport \n\n or delivery into a cell, the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is preferably stable and remains intact, i.e. the antibody remains linked to the drug moiety. The linkers are stable outside the target cell and may be cleaved at some efficacious rate inside the cell. An effective linker will: (i) maintain the specific binding properties of the antibody; (ii) allow intracellular delivery of the conjugate or drug moiety; (iii) remain stable and intact, i.e. not cleaved, until the conjugate has been delivered or transported to its targetted site; and (iv) maintain a cytotoxic, cell-killing effect or a cytostatic effect of the anthracycline derivative drug moiety. Stability of the ADC may be measured by standard analytical techniques such as mass spectroscopy, HPLC, and the separation/analysis technique LC/MS.\n\n\n[0190] Covalent attachment of the antibody and the drug moiety requires the linker, and optional spacer, to have two reactive functional groups, i.e. bivalency in a reactive sense. Bivalent linker reagents which are useful to attach two or more functional or biologically active moieties, such as peptides, nucleic acids, drugs, toxins, antibodies, haptens, and reporter groups are known, and methods have been described their resulting conjugates (Hermanson, G.T. (1996) Bioconjugate Techniques; Academic Press: New York, p 234-242). [0191] In another embodiment, the linker or spacer may be substituted with groups which modulate solubility or reactivity. For example, a sulfonate substituent may increase water solubility of the reagent and facilitate the coupling reaction of the linker reagent with the antibody or the drug moiety, or facilitate the coupling reaction of Ab-L with D, or D-L with Ab, depending on the synthetic route employed to prepare the ADC. [0192] Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include, but are not limited to: (i) N- terminal amine groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol). Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody (or fragment thereof) by introducing one, two, three, four, or more cysteine residues (e.g., preparing mutant \n\n antibodies comprising one or more non-native cysteine amino acid residues). US 2007/0092940 teaches engineering antibodies by introduction of reactive cysteine amino acids.\n\n\n[0193] In some embodiments, a Linker has a reactive nucleophilic group which is reactive with an electrophilic group present on an antibody. Useful electrophilic groups on an antibody include, but are not limited to, aldehyde and ketone carbonyl groups. The heteroatom of a nucleophilic group of a Linker can react with an electrophilic group on an antibody and form a covalent bond to an antibody unit. Useful nucleophilic groups on a Linker include, but are not limited to, hydrazide, oxime, amino, hydroxyl, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide. The electrophilic group on an antibody provides a convenient site for attachment to a Linker.\n\n\n[0194] Nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include, but are not limited to: amine, thiol, hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups.\n\n\n[0195] Spacers (Z) can be peptidic, comprising one or more amino acid units.\n\n\nPeptide linker reagents may be prepared by solid phase or liquid phase synthesis methods (E. Schroder and K. Lubke, The Peptides, volume 1, pp 76-136 (1965) Academic Press) that are well known in the field of peptide chemistry, including t-BOC chemistry (Geiser et al \"Automation of solid-phase peptide synthesis\" in Macromolecular Sequencing and Synthesis, Alan R. Liss, Inc., 1988, pp. 199-218) and Fmoc/HBTU chemistry (Fields, G. and Noble, R. (1990) \"Solid phase peptide synthesis utilizing 9-fluoroenylmethoxycarbonyl amino acids\", Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 35: 161-214), on an automated synthesizer such as the Rainin Symphony Peptide Synthesizer (Protein Technologies, Inc., Tucson, AZ), or Model 433 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).\n\n\n[0196] Exemplary amino acid linkers include a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a tetrapeptide or a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include: valine-citrulline (vc or val-cit), alanine- phenylalanine (af or ala-phe). Exemplary tripeptides include: glycine -valine-citrulline (gly- val-cit) and glycine-glycine-glycine (gly-gly-gly). Amino acid residues which comprise an amino acid linker component include those occurring naturally, as well as minor amino acids and non-naturally occurring amino acid analogs, such as citrulline. Amino acid linker components can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a \n\n particular enzymes, for example, a tumor-associated protease, cathepsin B, C and D, or a plasmin protease.\n\n\n[0197] Amino acid side chains include those occurring naturally, as well as minor amino acids and non-naturally occurring amino acid analogs, such as citrulline. Amino acid side chains include hydrogen, methyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, benzyl, p- hydroxybenzyl, -CH\n2\nOH, -CH(OH)CH\n3\n, -CH\n2\nCH\n2\nSCH\n3\n, -CH\n2\nCONH\n2\n, -CH\n2\nCOOH, - CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCONH\n2\n, -CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCOOH, -(CH\n2\n)\n3\nNHC(=NH)NH\n2\n, -(CH\n2\n)\n3\nNH\n2\n, - (CH\n2\n)\n3\nNHCOCH\n3\n, -(CH\n2\n)\n3\nNHCHO, -(CH\n2\n)\n4\nNHC(=NH)NH\n2\n, -(CH\n2\n)\n4\nNH\n2\n, - (CH\n2\n)\n4\nNHCOCH\n3\n, -(CH\n2\n)\n4\nNHCHO, -(CH\n2\n)\n3\nNHCONH\n2\n, -(CH\n2\n)\n4\nNHCONH\n2\n, - CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH(OH)CH\n2\nNH\n2\n, 2-pyridylmethyl-, 3-pyridylmethyl-, 4-pyridylmethyl-, phenyl, cyclohexyl, as well as the following structures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0198] When the amino acid side chains include other than hydrogen (glycine), the carbon atom to which the amino acid side chain is attached is chiral. Each carbon atom to which the amino acid side chain is attached is independently in the (S) or (R) configuration, or a racemic mixture. Drug-linker reagents may thus be enantiomerically pure, racemic, or diastereomeric.\n\n\n[0199] In exemplary embodiments, amino acid side chains are selected from those of natural and non-natural amino acids, including alanine, 2-amino-2-cyclohexylacetic acid, 2- amino-2-phenylacetic acid, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, norleucine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, valine, γ-aminobutyric acid, α,α-dimethyl γ- aminobutyric acid, β,β-dimethyl γ-aminobutyric acid, ornithine, and citrulline (Cit). \n\n DRUG-LINKER INTERMEDIATES\n\n\n[0200] The invention includes drug-linker intermediates useful for conjugation to proteins, peptides, and antibodies.

Chem. Int. Ed. 42:4490-4494; Amir et al (2003) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 42:4494-4499; Shamis et al (2004) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 126: 1726-1731; Sun et al (2002) Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 12:2213- 2215; Sun et al (2003) Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry 11 : 1761-1768; King et al (2002) Tetrahedron Letters 43: 1987-1990). Dendritic linkers can increase the molar ratio of drug to antibody, i.e. loading, which is related to the potency of the ADC. Thus, where an antibody bears only one reactive cysteine thiol group, a multitude of drug moieties may be attached through a dendritic or branched linker.\n\n\nCARRIER\n\n\n[0232] The carrier moiety of anthracycline derivative conjugates is derived from polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, proteins or peptides of natural or synthetic origin. Carrier compounds T-NH\n2\n, T-COOH, T-CHO, T-SH, (V) or (VI) are suitable for conjugation with anthracycline derivative compounds. Carrier moieties may be derived from polyclonal antibodies raised against tumor associated antigens; or from monoclonal antibodies binding to antigens preferentially or selectively expressed on tumor cell populations; or from natural or recombinant peptides or proteins or growth factors preferentially or selectively binding to tumor cells; or from natural or synthetic polymeric carriers such as polylysine, polyglutamic acid, polyaspartic acid and their analogues and derivatives, or such as dextran or other polymeric carbohydrate analogues and their derivatives; or from synthetic copolymers such as those derived from N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) see: J. Kopecek, Macromolecules. H. Benoit & P. Rempp, Ed.: 505-520 (1982) Pergamon Press. Oxford, England; or from poly(aminoacid) copolymers such as poly(GluNa, Ala, Tyr) which are useful as targetable drug-carriers for lung tissue R. Duncan et al., Journal of Bioactive and Compatible Polymers, VoI 4, July 1989. The carrier portion may be also derived from portions of the above mentioned peptides or proteins obtained through recombinant DNA techniques.\n\n\nANTIBODIES [0233] Representative examples of the above mentioned antibodies and of respective \n\n possible therapeutic applications are: anti-T-cell antibody TlOl (Royston, I. et al., J. Immunol. 1980, 125:725); anti-CD5 antibody OKTl (Ortho) ATCC CRL 8000 cronic lymphocytic leukemias); anti-CD20 antibody IgGl ibritumomab, (Theuer, C. P. et al. Biotechnology Annual Review 2004 non-hodgkin's lymphoma); anti-CD33 antibody huCD33, (Drug of the future 2000 25(7):686 acute myeloid leukemia); anti-transferrin receptor antibody OKT9 (Ortho) ATCC CRL 8021 ovarian and other tumors; anti-melanoma antibody MAb 9.2.27 (Bumol, T. F. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1982, 79: 1245 melanomas); anti-carcinoma markers antibody such as: anti-CEA 1116 NS-3d ATCC CRL 8019), anti-alpha-fetoprotein OM 3-1.1 ATCC HB 134 also hepatomas), 791T/36 (Embleton, M. J. et al., Br. J. Cancer 1981, 43, 582 also osteogenic sarcoma), B 72.3 (US 4522918 colorectal carcinomas and other tumors), anti-ovarian carcinoma antibody OVB 3 ATCC HB 9147, anti-breast carcinoma antibody HMGF antigen (Aboud-Pirak, E. et al., Cancer Res. 1988, 48:3188), anti-bladder carcinoma 1G3.10 (Yu, D. S. et al., Eur. J. Urol. 1987, 13: 198), anti-CanAg antibody huC242 antibody (Olcher, Anthony W. et al., Journal of Clinical Oncology 2003, 21(2):211-222 colon, pancreas, gastric), anti-prostate antibody MLN591 (Henry, Michael D.et al., Cancer Research 2004 advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer).\n\n\n[0234] Representative examples of the above mentioned growth factors and proteins of natural or recombinant origin are FGF, EGF, PDGF, TGF- ALPHA , ALPHA -MS, Interleukins, Interferons, TNF, melanotropin (MSH), Mcm2 etc. The carrier T-CHO is preferably derived from polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies having the carbohydrate moiety, preferentially located in the Fc region, selectively oxidized to aldehyde groups by means of chemical or enzymatic methods, as described in US 4671958. [0235] The antibody unit (Ab) of Formula Hc includes any unit, type, or class of antibody that binds or reactively associates or complexes with a receptor, antigen or other receptive moiety associated with a given target-cell population. An antibody can be any protein or protein-like molecule that binds to, complexes with, or reacts with a moiety of a cell population sought to be therapeutically or otherwise biologically modified. In one aspect, the antibody unit acts to deliver the anthracycline derivative drug moiety to the particular target cell population with which the antibody unit reacts. Such antibodies include, but are not limited to, large molecular weight proteins such as, full-length antibodies and antibody fragments. The antibodies of Formula I allow attaining high concentrations of active metabolite molecules in cancer cells. Intracellular targeting may be achieved by methods and compounds which allow accumulation or retention of biologically active agents \n\n inside cells. Such effective targeting may be applicable to a variety of therapeutic formulations and procedures.\n\n\n[0236] In one embodiment, the ADC specifically binds to a receptor encoded by an\n\n\nErbB gene, such as EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4. The ADC may specifically bind to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor. The ADC may inhibit growth of tumor cells which overexpress HER2 receptor.\n\n\n[0237] In another embodiment, the antibody (Ab) of Formula Hc is a humanized antibody such as huMAb4D5-l, huMAb4D5-2, huMAb4D5-3, huMAb4D5-4, huMAb4D5-5, huMAb4D5-6, huMAb4D5-7 or huMAb4D5-8 (trastuzumab).\n\n\n[0238] The antibodies of the invention include cysteine-engineered antibodies where one or more amino acids of any form of wild-type or parent antibody is replaced with a cysteine amino acid. The engineered cysteine amino acid is a free cysteine acid and not part of an intrachain or interchain disulfide unit. Any form, type, or variant of antibody may be so engineered, i.e. mutated. For example, a parent Fab antibody fragment may be engineered to form a cysteine engineered Fab, referred to herein as \"ThioFab.\" Similarly, a parent monoclonal antibody may be engineered to form a \"ThioMab.\" It should be noted that a single site mutation yields a single engineered cysteine residue in a ThioFab, while a single site mutation yields two engineered cysteine residues in a ThioMab, due to the dimeric nature of the IgG antibody. The cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention include monoclonal antibodies, humanized or chimeric monoclonal antibodies, antigen-binding fragments of antibodies, fusion polypeptides and analogs that preferentially bind cell-associated polypeptides.\n\n\n[0239] Cysteine-engineered antibodies have been designed as Fab antibody fragments\n\n\n(thioFab) and expressed as full-length, IgG monoclonal (thioMab) antibodies (US 7521541, the contents of which are incorporated by reference). ThioFab and ThioMab antibodies have been conjugated through linkers at the newly introduced cysteine thiols with thiol-reactive linker reagents and drug-linker reagents to prepare antibody-drug conjugates (Thio ADC), including anti-HER2 (US 7521541), anti-CD22 (US 2008/0050310), and anti-steapl (WO 2008/052187), as well as other cysteine engineered antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates. [0240] Antibodies comprising the antibody-drug conjugates of Formula Hc preferably retain the antigen binding capability of their native, wild type counterparts. Thus, antibodies of the invention are capable of binding, preferably specifically, to antigens. Such antigens include, for example, tumor-associated antigens (TAA), cell surface receptor proteins and other cell surface molecules, cell survival regulatory factors, cell proliferation regulatory \n\n factors, molecules associated with (for e.g., known or suspected to contribute functionally to) tissue development or differentiation, lymphokines, cytokines, molecules involved in cell cycle regulation, molecules involved in vasculogenesis and molecules associated with (for e.g., known or suspected to contribute functionally to) angiogenesis. The tumor-associated antigen may be a cluster differentiation factor (i.e., a CD protein). An antigen to which an antibody of the invention is capable of binding may be a member of a subset of one of the above-mentioned categories, wherein the other subset(s) of said category comprise other molecules/antigens that have a distinct characteristic (with respect to the antigen of interest). [0241] In one embodiment, the antibody of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of\n\n\nFormula Hc specifically binds to a receptor encoded by an ErbB gene. The antibody may bind specifically to an ErbB receptor selected from EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4. The ADC may specifically bind to the extracellular domain (ECD) of the HER2 receptor and inhibit the growth of tumor cells which overexpress HER2 receptor. The antibody of the ADC may be a monoclonal antibody, e.g. a murine monoclonal antibody, a chimeric antibody, or a humanized antibody. A humanized antibody may be huMAb4D5-l, huMAb4D5-2, huMAb4D5-3, huMAb4D5-4, huMAb4D5-5, huMAb4D5-6, huMAb4D5-7 or huMAb4D5-8 (trastuzumab). The antibody may be an antibody fragment, e.g. a Fab fragment.\n\n\n[0242] Antibodies in Formula Hc antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and which may be useful in the treatment of cancer include, but are not limited to, antibodies against cell surface receptors and tumor-associated antigens (TAA). Such tumor-associated antigens are known in the art, and can be prepared for use in generating antibodies using methods and information which are well known in the art. In attempts to discover effective cellular targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy, researchers have sought to identify transmembrane or otherwise tumor-associated polypeptides that are specifically expressed on the surface of one or more particular type(s) of cancer cell as compared to on one or more normal noncancerous cell(s). Often, such tumor-associated polypeptides are more abundantly expressed on the surface of the cancer cells as compared to on the surface of the non-cancerous cells. The identification of such tumor-associated cell surface antigen polypeptides has given rise to the ability to specifically target cancer cells for destruction via antibody-based therapies. [0243] Examples of TAA include, but are not limited to the Tumor- Associated\n\n\nAntigens (l)-(36) listed below. For convenience, information relating to these antigens, all of which are known in the art, is listed below and includes names, alternative names, Genbank accession numbers and primary reference(s), following nucleic acid and protein sequence \n\n identification conventions of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Nucleic acid and protein sequences corresponding to TAA (l)-(36) are available in public databases such as GenBank. Tumor-associated antigens targeted by antibodies include all amino acid sequence variants and isoforms possessing at least about 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% sequence identity relative to the sequences identified in the cited references, or which exhibit substantially the same biological properties or characteristics as a TAA having a sequence found in the cited references. For example, a TAA having a variant sequence generally is able to bind specifically to an antibody that binds specifically to the TAA with the corresponding sequence listed. The sequences and disclosure in the reference specifically recited herein are expressly incorporated by reference.\n\n\nTUMOR-ASSOCIATED ANTIGENS (l)-(36):\n\n\n[0244] (1) BMPRlB (bone morphogenetic protein receptor-type IB, Genbank accession no.

In one embodiment, the anthracycline derivative conjugate compounds include an antibody conjugated, i.e. covalently attached by a linker, to an anthracycline derivative drug moiety where the drug when not conjugated to an antibody has a cytotoxic or cytostatic effect. The biological activity of the drug moiety is thus modulated by conjugation to an antibody. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention may selectively deliver an effective dose of a cytotoxic agent to tumor tissue whereby greater selectivity, i.e. a lower efficacious dose may be achieved.\n\n\n[0410] In one embodiment, the bioavailability of the ADC, or an intracellular metabolite of the ADC, is improved in a mammal when compared to the corresponding PNU- 159682, anthracycline derivative compound alone. Also, the bioavailability of the ADC, or \n\n an intracellular metabolite of the ADC is improved in a mammal when compared to the corresponding antibody alone (antibody of the ADC, without the drug moiety or linker). [0411] In one embodiment, the anthracycline derivative drug moiety of the ADC is not cleaved from the antibody until the antibody-drug conjugate binds to a cell-surface receptor or enters a cell with a cell-surface receptor specific for the antibody of the antibody- drug conjugate. The drug moiety may be cleaved from the antibody after the antibody-drug conjugate enters the cell. The anthracycline derivative drug moiety may be intracellularly cleaved in a mammal from the antibody of the compound, or an intracellular metabolite of the compound, by enzymatic action, hydrolysis, oxidation, or other mechanism. [0412] Antibody drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties, which can react with nucleophilic subsituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized, e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage, or may be reduced, e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment, reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either glactose oxidase or sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug (Hermanson, G.T. (1996) Bioconjugate Techniques; Academic Press: New York, p 234-242). In another embodiment, proteins containing N-terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (Geoghegan & Stroh, (1992) Bioconjugate Chem. 3: 138-146; US 5362852). Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.\n\n\n[0413] In one embodiment, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) compound comprises an antibody covalently attached by a linker L and an optional spacer Z to one or more anthracycline derivative drug moieties D, the compound having formula (Ic)\n\n\nAb-(L-Z\nm\n-D)\np\n Ic\n\n\n[0414] or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein:\n\n\n[0415] Ab is an antibody;\n\n\n[0416] D is an anthracycline derivative selected from the structures: \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n[0417] where the wavy line indicates the attachment to L;\n\n\n[0418] L is a linker selected from -N(R)-, -N(R)\n1n\n(C\n1\n-Ci\n2\n alkylene)-, -N(R)\n1n\n(C\n2\n-\n\n\nC\n8\n alkenylene)-, -N(R)\n1n\n(C\n2\n-C\n8\n alkynylene)-, -N(R)\n1n\n(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n-, and the structures: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0419] where the wavy lines indicate the attachments to D and Z; and\n\n\n[0420] Z is an optional spacer selected from -CH\n2\nC(O)-, -CH\n2\nC(O)NR(C\n1\n-Ci\n2\n alkylene)-, and the structures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0421] R is H, Ci -C i2 alkyl, or C6-C20 aryl; [0422] R\n1\n and R\n2\n are independently selected from an amino acid side chain; [0423] Z\n1\n is selected from -(C\n1\n-Ci\n2\n alkylene)-, -(C\n2\n-C\n8\n alkenylene)-, -(C\n2\n-C\n8\n alkynylene)-, and -(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n-, [0424] m is O or l;\n\n\n[0425] n is 1 to 6; and\n\n\n[0426] p is an integer from 1 to 8.\n\n\n[0427] Formula I compounds include all mixtures of variously loaded and attached antibody-drug conjugates where 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 drug moieties are covalently attached to the antibody. [0428] Exemplary embodiments of antibody-drug conjugates include:\n\n\n \n\n valine-citrulline (val-cit or vc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0429] where A\na\n is a divalent unit, such as MC (maleimidocaproyl), MP\n\n\n(maleimidopropanoyl) or MPEG (2-(2-(2-(2,5-dioxo-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-1- yl)ethoxy)ethoxy)acetyl), capable of linking an antibody (Ab) to an amino acid unit, such as valine -citrulline; and Y\ny\n is a divalent unit, such as PAB (para-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl) which links an amino acid unit to the drug moiety (D) when an amino acid unit is present. In other embodiments, A\na\n links Y\ny\n directly to the drug moiety when the amino acid unit is absent. In other embodiments, the Y\ny\n unit links directly the drug moiety to the antibody unit \n\n when both the amino acid unit and the A\na\n unit are absent.\n\n\n[0430] Exemplary antibody-disulfide linker drug conjugates are represented by the structures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0431] The disulfide linker SPP may be constructed with linker reagent N- succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate.\n\n\n[0432] The antibody-drug conjugates of formula (I) and the compounds of the formula (V) include all enantiomers, diastereomers, isomerically enriched, racemic mixtures, isotopically labelled and isotopically enriched forms (e.g. \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n15\nN), and protected forms thereof.\n\n\n[0433] Not to be limited by any particular mechanism of action, the antibody-drug conjugates of formula (I) and the compound of the formula (V) of the present invention may be useful therapeutic agents since they contain an acetalic bond or a hydrazone bond, which releases the parent drug (II) upon hydronium-ion-catalyzed hydrolysis or \"in vivo\" enzymatic cleavage. It is well known that in malignant tumors there is a high rate of glycolysis compared to normal tissue, causing an increase in the production of lactate and thus a decrease of the pH in the tumor see: H. M. Rauen et al., Z. Naturforsch, Teil B, 23 (1968) 1461. The invention affords a two level specificity of action of the compounds, the first one consisting in a preferential localization of the conjugate in the tumor tissue by means of antigenic recognition, and the second one consisting in a preferential release of the drug in its active form in the tumor tissue by means of preferential acidic cleavage. While not limiting the scope or utility of the compositions or methods of the invention, the acid-sensitive acetal linkers described herein may be cleaved in vivo under localized or systemic acidic conditions, thus separating the targeting antibody from the drug moiety.\n\n\n[0434] The conjugates produced according to the methods described are characterized following different chemical-physical methods. The retention of the original molecular weight and the lack of aggregate formation may be assessed by chromatographic gel filtration \n\n procedures (Yu, D. S. et al., J. Urol. 140, 415, 1988) with simultaneous and independent detection of anthracycline and antibody at different wavelengths, and by gel electrophoretic methods. The overall charge distribution of the compounds obtained may be assessed by chromatographic ion exchange methods. The anthracycline concentration may be assessed by spectrophotometric titration against a standard calibration curve obtained from the parent anthracycline. The protein concentration may be assessed by colorimetric assays such as the bicinchonic acid assay (Smith, P. K. et al., Anal. Biochem. 150, 76, 1985) or the Bradford dye assay (Bradford, M. M., (1976) Anal. Biochem. 72:248). The antigen binding activity retention of the antibodies, after the conjugation procedures, may be assessed by an ELISA method (Yu, D. S. et al., J. Urol. 140, 415, 1988) and by cytofluorimetric methods (Gallego, J. et al., Int. J. Cancer 33, 737, 1984). The acid sensitivity of the conjugate may be evaluated by chromatographic methods after incubation of the compounds in suitable buffered solutions.\n\n\nDRUG LOADING\n\n\n[0435] The drug loading is represented by p in an antibody-drug conjugate molecule of Formula I, the average number of anthracycline derivative drugs per antibody. Drug loading may range from 1 to 8 drugs (D) per antibody (Ab), i.e. where 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 drug moieties are covalently attached to the antibody. Compositions of ADC of Formula I include collections of antibodies conjugated with a range of drugs, from 1 to 8. The average number of drugs per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, electrophoresis, and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. By ELISA, the averaged value of p in a particular preparation of ADC may be determined (Hamblett et al (2004) Clin. Cancer Res. 10:7063-7070; Sanderson et al (2005) Clin. Cancer Res. 11 :843-852). However, the distribution of p (drug) values is not discernible by the antibody-antigen binding and detection limitation of ELISA. Also, ELISA assay for detection of antibody-drug conjugates does not determine where the drug moieties are attached to the antibody, such as the heavy chain or light chain fragments, or the particular amino acid residues. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis. [0436] For some antibody-drug conjugates, p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example, an antibody may have only one or several \n\n cysteine thiol groups, or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. Higher drug loading, e.g. p >5, may cause aggregation, insolubility, toxicity, or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody-drug conjugates.\n\n\n[0437] Typically, fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain, for example, many lysine residues that do not react with the drug-linker intermediate (D-L) or linker reagent. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine -reactive linker reagent. Also, only the most reactive cysteine thiol groups may react with a thiol-reactive linker reagent. Generally, antibodies do not contain many, if any, free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies of the compounds exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or TCEP, under partial or total reducing conditions. Additionally, the antibody must be subjected to denaturing conditions to reveal reactive nucleophilic groups such as lysine or cysteine. The loading (drug/antibody ratio) of an ADC may be controlled in several different manners, including: (i) limiting the molar excess of drug-linker intermediate (D-L) or linker reagent relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, and (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.\n\n\n[0438] Cysteine amino acids may be engineered at reactive sites in an antibody and which do not form intrachain or intermolecular disulfide linkages (US 7521541). The engineered cysteine thiols may react with linker reagents or the drug- linker reagents of the present invention which have thiol-reactive, electrophilic groups such as maleimide or alpha- halo amides to form ADC with cysteine engineered antibodies and the anthracycline derivative drug moieties. The location of the drug moiety can thus be designed, controlled, and known. The drug loading can be controlled since the engineered cysteine thiol groups typically react with thiol-reactive linker reagents or drug-linker reagents in high yield. Engineering an IgG antibody to introduce a cysteine amino acid by substitution at a single site on the heavy or light chain gives two new cysteines on the symmetrical antibody. A drug loading near 2 can be achieved and near homogeneity of the conjugation product ADC. [0439] Where more than one nucleophilic or electrophilic group of the antibody reacts with a drug-linker intermediate, or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of drug moieties attached to an antibody, e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc. Liquid chromatography methods such as \n\n polymeric reverse phase (PLRP) and hydrophobic interaction (HIC) may separate compounds in the mixture by drug loading value. Preparations of ADC with a single drug loading value (p) may be isolated, however, these single loading value ADCs may still be heterogeneous mixtures because the drug moieties may be attached, via the linker, at different sites on the antibody.\n\n\n[0440] Thus the antibody-drug conjugate compositions of the invention include mixtures of antibody-drug conjugate compounds where the antibody has one or more anthracycline derivative drug moieties and where the drug moieties may be attached to the antibody at various amino acid residues.\n\n\nPREPARATION OF ANTIBODY-DRUG CONJUGATES\n\n\n[0441] The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes, employing organic chemistry reactions, conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent, to form antibody-linker intermediate Ab-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with an activated drug moiety reagent ; and (2) reaction of a nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of a drug moiety reagent with a linker reagent, to form drug-linker reagent D-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of an antibody. Conjugation methods (1) and (2) may be employed with a variety of antibodies, drug moieties, and linkers to prepare the antibody-drug conjugates of Formula I. [0442] Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include, but are not limited to: (i) N- terminal amine groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (Cleland's reagent, dithiothreitol) or TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; Getz et al (1999) Anal. Biochem. VoI 273:73-80; Soltec Ventures, Beverly, MA). Each cysteine disulfide bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine \n\n into a thiol.\n\n\n[0443] Antibody-drug conjugates may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties, which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized, e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage, or may be reduced, e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment, reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug (Hermanson, G.T. (1996) Bioconjugate Techniques; Academic Press: New York, p 234- 242). In another embodiment, proteins containing N-terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (Geoghegan & Stroh, (1992) Bioconjugate Chem. 3: 138-146; US 5362852). Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile. [0444] Likewise, nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include, but are not limited to: amine, thiol, hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Reactive nucleophilic groups may be introduced on the anthracycline derivative compounds by standard functional group interconversions. For example, hydroxyl groups may be converted to thiol groups by Mitsunobu-type reactions, to form thiol-modified drug compounds. [0445] The antibody-drug conjugates in Table 2 were prepared according to the described methods in the Examples and tested for efficacy by in vitro cell proliferation assay and in vivo tumor xenograft growth inhibition. \n\n Table 2 Antibody-drug conjugates\n\n\n \n\n SCREENING FOR ANTIBODY-DRUG CONJUGATES (ADC) DIRECTED AGAINST TUMOR-ASSOCIATED ANTIGENS AND CELL SURFACE RECEPTORS\n\n\n[0446] Assay methods for detecting cancer cells comprise exposing cells to an antibody-drug conjugate compound, and determining the extent of binding of the antibody- drug conjugate compound to the cells. Formula I ADC compounds which are identified in the animal models and cell-based assays can be further tested in tumor-bearing higher primates and human clinical trials.\n\n\n[0447] Transgenic animals and cell lines are particularly useful in screening antibody- drug conjugates (ADC) that have potential as prophylactic or therapeutic treatments of diseases or disorders involving overexpression of tumor-associated antigens and cell surface receptors, e.g. HER2 (US 6632979). Screening for a useful ADC may involve administering candidate ADC over a range of doses to the transgenic animal, and assaying at various time points for the effect(s) of the ADC on the disease or disorder being evaluated. Alternatively, or additionally, the drug can be administered prior to or simultaneously with exposure to an inducer of the disease, if applicable. Candidate ADC may be screened serially and individually, or in parallel under medium or high-throughput screening format. The rate at which ADC may be screened for utility for prophylactic or therapeutic treatments of diseases or disorders is limited only by the rate of synthesis or screening methodology, including detecting/measuring/analysis of data.\n\n\n[0448] One embodiment is a screening method comprising (a) transplanting cells from a stable breast cancer cell line into a non-human animal, (b) administering an ADC drug candidate to the non-human animal and (c) determining the ability of the candidate to inhibit the formation of tumors from the transplanted cell line. The invention also concerns a method of screening ADC candidates for the treatment of a disease or disorder characterized by the overexpression of a receptor protein comprising (a) contacting cells from a stable breast cancer cell line with a drug candidate and (b) evaluating the ability of the ADC candidate to inhibit the growth of the stable cell line.\n\n\n[0449] One embodiment is a screening method comprising (a) contacting cells from a stable breast cancer cell line with an ADC drug candidate and (b) evaluating the ability of the ADC candidate to induce cell death, induce apoptosis, block heregulin binding, block ligand- stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, or block ligand activation of HER2. Another embodiment the ability of the ADC candidate to is evaluated. In another embodiment the ability of the ADC candidate to is evaluated. [0450] Another embodiment is a screening method comprising (a) administering an \n\n ADC drug candidate to a transgenic non-human mammal that overexpresses, e.g. in its mammary gland cells, a native human protein, e.g. HER2 or a fragment thereof, wherein such transgenic mammal has stably integrated into its genome a nucleic acid sequence encoding the native human protein or a fragment thereof having the biological activity of the native human protein, operably linked to transcriptional regulatory sequences directing its expression, and develops a tumor. Candidate ADC are screened by being administered to the transgenic animal over a range of doses, and evaluating the animal's physiological response to the compounds over time. Administration may be oral, or by suitable injection, depending on the chemical nature of the compound being evaluated. In some cases, it may be appropriate to administer the compound in conjunction with co-factors that would enhance the efficacy of the compound. If cell lines derived from the subject transgenic animals are used to screen for compounds useful in treating various disorders associated with overexpression of certain tumor-associated antigen proteins or cell surface receptors, e.g. HER2-overexpression. To identify growth inhibitory ADC compounds that specifically target HER2, one may screen for ADC which inhibit the growth of HER2-overexpressing cancer cells derived from transgenic animals (US 5677171)\n\n\nIN VITRO CELL PROLIFERATION ASSAY\n\n\n[0451] Generally, the cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of an antibody-drug conjugate\n\n\n(ADC) is measured by: exposing mammalian cells having tumor-associated antigens or receptor proteins to the antibody of the ADC in a cell culture medium; culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 5 days; and measuring cell viability. Cell-based in vitro assays may be used to measure viability, i.e. proliferation (IC50), cytotoxicity (EC50), and induction of apoptosis (caspase activation) of the ADC. The CeIlT iter-Glo\n®\n Luminescent Cell Viability Assay is a commercially available (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), homogeneous assay method based on the recombinant expression of Coleoptera luciferase (US 5583024; US 5674713; US 5700670). This cell proliferation assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, an indicator of metabolically active cells (Crouch et al (1993) J. Immunol. Meth. 160:81-88; US 6602677). The CellTiter-Glo\n®\n Assay is conducted in 96 well format, making it amenable to automated high-throughput screening (HTS) (Cree et al (1995) Anticancer Drugs 6:398-404). The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent (CellTiter-Glo\n®\n Reagent) directly to cells cultured in serum-supplemented medium. Cell washing, removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15 cells/well in a \n\n 384-well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing.\n\n\n[0452] The evaluation of the retention of cytotoxicity of conjugates in comparison with the parent drug may be assessed by a test based on the quantification of ATP. A2780 human ovarian and MCF7 human breast cancer cells (1250 cells/well) were seeded in white 384 well-plates in complete medium (RPMI 1640 or EMEM plus 10% Fetal bovine serum) and treated with compounds dissolved in 0.1% DMSO, 24h after seeding. The cells were incubated at 37°C and 5 % CO2 and after 72 hours the plates were processed using CellTiter- GIo assay (Promega) following the manufacturer's instruction.\n\n\n[0453] CellTiter-Glo is a homogenous method based on the quantification of the ATP present, an indicator of metabolically active cells. ATP is quantified using a system based on luciferase and D-luciferin resulting into light generation. The luminescent signal is proportional to the number of cells present in culture. Briefly, 25 μL/well reagent solutions were added to each well and after 5 minutes shacking microplates were read by a luminometer. The luminescent signal is proportional to the number of cells present in culture. [0454] The anti-proliferative effects of antibody-drug conjugates of Formula Ic\n\n\n(Table 6) were measured by the CellTiter-Glo\n®\n Assay (Example 9) against the HER2 expressing tumor cell lines in Figures 8-29 in 3 day continuous exposure studies. [0455] Figure 8 shows a plot of SK-BR-3 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: free drug PNU-159682 continuous exposure, PNU-159682 1 hr incubation, linker drug: NHS-ketal-Ant 50, linker drug: maleimide-ketal-Ant 51, linker drug: maleimide- hydrazone-Ant 52, and linker drug: thiopyridine-hydrazone-Ant 53. The HER2 expression level of SK-BR-3 cells is 3+. SK-BR-3 cell proliferation was most potently inhibited by continuous exposure to PNU-159682. Brief (1 hr) exposure also effectively inhibited growth of SK-BR-3 cells. Hydrazone-linked Ant 52 and 53 were less potent than free Ant, while ketal-linked Ant 50 and 51 linker drug intermediates showed minimal anti-proliferative activity.\n\n\n[0456] Figure 9 shows a plot of BT-474 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: free drug: PNU-159682 continuous exposure, free drug: PNU-159682 1 hr incubation, linker drug: NHS-ketal-Ant 50, linker drug: maleimide-ketal-Ant 51, linker drug: maleimide-hydrazone-Ant 52, and linker drug: thiopyridine-hydrazone-Ant 53. The HER2 expression level of BT-474 cells is 3+. BT-474 cell proliferation was most potently inhibited by continuous exposure to PNU-159682. Brief (1 hr) exposure also effectively inhibited growth of BT-474 cells. Hydrazone-linked Ant 52 and 53 showed minimal anti-proliferative activity, while ketal-linked Ant 50 and 51 were inactive. \n\n [0457] Figure 10 shows a plot of MCF7 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: free drug: PNU- 159682 continuous exposure, free drug: PNU- 159682 1 hr incubation, linker drug: NHS-ketal-Ant 50, linker drug: maleimide-ketal-Ant 51, linker drug: maleimide-hydrazone-Ant 52, and linker drug: thiopyridine-hydrazone-Ant 53. MCF7 cell proliferation was most potently inhibited by continuous exposure to PNU-159682. Brief (1 hr) exposure also effectively inhibited growth of MCF7 cells. Hydrazone-linked Ant 52 and 53 showed minial anti-proliferative activity, while ketal-linked Ant 50 and 51 were inactive. [0458] Figure 11 shows a plot of doxorubicin-resistant (DoxRes) HER2 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: free drug: PNU-159682 continuous exposure, free drug: PNU-159682 1 hr incubation, linker drug: NHS-ketal-Ant 50, linker drug: maleimide-ketal-Ant 51, linker drug: maleimide-hydrazone-Ant 52, and linker drug: thiopyridine-hydrazone-Ant 53. The HER2 expression level of DoxRes HER2 cells is 3+, with high PgP/MDRl. DoxRes/HER2 cell proliferation was most potently inhibited by continuous exposure to PNU-159682. Brief (1 hr) exposure also effectively inhibited growth of AdrRes/HER2 cells. Hydrazone-linked Ant 52 and 53 were less potent than free Ant, while ketal-linked Ant 50 and 51 showed minimal anti-proliferative activity. The DoxRes Her2 cell line is also known as \"AdrRes Her2\".\n\n\n[0459] Figure 12 shows a plot of SK-BR-3 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: trastuzumab, trastuzumab-MCC-DMl 101, thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)- maleimide ketal-Ant 102, and thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 103. Thio-Tr-HC-maleimide-hydrazone-Ant 103 showed the most potent anti-proliferative activity on SK-BR-3 cells. Thio-Tr-HC-maleimide-ketal-Ant 102 and Tr-MCC-DMl 101 were equally potent in terms of IC50, but treatment of SK-BR-3 cells with 102 resulted in greater cell killing than 101. All conjugates tested were more potent than trastuzumab. [0460] Figure 13 shows a plot of BT-474 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: trastuzumab, trastuzumab-MCC-DMl 101, thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)- maleimide ketal-Ant 102, and thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 103. Thio-Tr-HC-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 103 showed the most potent anti-proliferative activity on BT-474 cells. Thio-Tr-HC-maleimide-ketal-Ant 102 and Tr-MCC-DMl 101 were equally potent in inhibiting growth of BT-474 cells. All conjugates tested were more potent than trastuzumab.\n\n\n[0461] Figure 14 shows a plot of MCF-7 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: trastuzumab, trastuzumab-MCC-DMl 101, thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)- maleimide ketal-Ant 102, and thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 103. \n\n The HER2 expression level of MCF7 cells is normal. Thio-Tr-HC-maleimide-hydrazone-Ant 103 showed potent anti-proliferative activity on the Her2-normal MCF7 cell line. Trastuzumab, Tr-MCC-DMl 101 and thio-Tr-HC-maleimide-ketal-Ant 102 were not active on MCF7 cells.\n\n\n[0462] Figure 15 shows a plot of doxorubicin-resistant (DoxRes) HER2 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: trastuzumab, trastuzumab-MCC-DMl 101, thio- trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 102, and thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)- maleimide hydrazone-Ant 103. Thio-Tr-HC-maleimide-hydrazone-Ant 103 showed potent anti-proliferative activity on DoxRes/HER2 cells, which express high levels of both HER2 and the multi-drug resistance transporter MDRl/PgP. Thio-Tr-HC-maleimide-ketal-Ant 103 was active only at the two highest concentrations tested (3.3 and 10 ug/ml) whereas Tr-MCC- DMl 101 and trastuzumab showed minimal activity on this cell line. [0463] Figure 16 shows a plot of SK-B R- 3 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: anti-CD22 NHS ketal-Ant 110, trastuzumab, trastuzumab-MCC-DMl 101, and thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-NHS-ketal-Ant 105. Thio-Tr-HC-NHS-ketal-Ant 105 and Tr-MCC-DMl 101 showed equivalent potency on SK-B R- 3 cell proliferation in terms of IC50; with 105 treatment resulting in greater cell killing. The non-targeted control anti-CD22- NHS-ketal-Ant 110 also showed potent anti-proliferative activity on SK-BR-3 cells. All conjugates tested were more potent than trastuzumab.\n\n\n[0464] Figure 17 shows a plot of BT-474 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: anti-CD22 NHS ketal-Ant 110, trastuzumab, trastuzumab-MCC-DMl 101, and thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-NHS-ketal-Ant 105. Thio-Tr-HC-NHS ketal-Ant 105 showed the most potent anti-proliferative activity on BT-474 cells. Treatment with Tr-MCC- DMl also resulted in growth inhibition of BT-474 cells. The non-targeted control anti- CD22-NHS-ketal-Ant 110 showed potent anti-proliferative effects on BT-474 cells. All conjugates tested were more potent than trastuzumab.\n\n\n[0465] Figure 18 shows a plot of MCF-7 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: anti-CD22 NHS ketal-Ant 110, trastuzumab, trastuzumab-MCC-DMl 101, and thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-NHS-ketal-Ant 105. Thio-Tr-HC-NHS-ketal-Ant 105 and anti-CD22-NHS-ketal-Ant 110 showed equivalent activity on low HER2 -expressing MCF7 cells. Trastuzumab and Tr-MCC-DMl 101 were not active on MCF7. [0466] Figure 19 shows a plot of doxorubicin-resistant (DoxRes) Her2 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: anti-CD22 NHS ketal-Ant 110, trastuzumab, trastuzumab-MCC-DMl 101, and thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-NHS-ketal-Ant 105. Thio- \n\n Tr-HC-NHS-ketal-Ant 105 and anti-CD22-NHS-ketal-Ant 110 showed equivalent activity on DoxRes/HER2 cells. Tr-MCC-DMl 101 showed modest activity, and trastuzumab had no effect on DoxRes/HER2.\n\n\n[0467] Figure 20 shows a plot of SK-B R- 3 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: thio-trastuzumab (HC A114C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 102, thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 103, thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-thiopyridine hydrazone-Ant 104, thio-trastuzumab (HC A114C)-NHS-ketal-Ant 105, trastuzumab-MCC- DMl 101, and thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE 106. [0468] Figure 21 shows a plot of SK-B R- 3 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: trastuzumab, thio-anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 107, thio- anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 108, thio-anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)- thiopyridine hydrazone-Ant 109, anti-CD22-NHS-ketal-Ant 110, and PNU-159682 free drug. As previously reported, trastuzumab modestly inhibits the growth of SK-BR-3 cells through a cytostatic mechanism. Non-targeted control ADCs thio-anti-CD22-HC-ketal-Ant 107 and anti-CD22-NHS-ketal-Ant 110 showed anti-proliferative activity only at the highest doses tested. Non-targeted control ADCs thio-anti-CD22-HC-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 108 and thio-anti-CD22-H-thiopyridine -hydrazone-Ant 109 showed equivalent potency for inhibiting SK-BR-3 cell growth as the HER2 -targeted ADCs (Figure 20), indicating lability of hydrazone-linked ADCs. Free drug PNU-159682, administered in μM concentrations, caused cytotoxicity at all doses tested.\n\n\n[0469] Figure 22 shows a plot of BT-474 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: thio-trastuzumab (HC A114C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 102, thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 103, thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-thiopyridine hydrazone-Ant 104, thio-trastuzumab (HC A114C)-NHS-ketal-Ant 105, trastuzumab-MCC- DMl 101, and thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE 106. All ADCs tested showed similar activity on BT-474 cell proliferation. Thio-Tr-HC-vc-MMAE 106 had the lowest IC\n50\n (0.01 μg/ml), while treatment with thio-Tr-HC-maleimide-hydrazone-Ant 103 and thio-Tr-HC-thiopyridine-hydrazone-Ant 104 resulted in the greatest amount of total growth inhibition.\n\n\n[0470] Figure 23 shows a plot of BT-474 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: trastuzumab, thio-anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 107, thio- anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 108, thio-anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)- thiopyridine hydrazone-Ant 109, anti-CD22-NHS-ketal-Ant 110, and PNU-159682 free drug. \n\n As previously reported, trastuzumab modestly inhibits the growth of BT-474 cells through a cytostatic mechanism. Non-targeted control ADCs thio-anti-CD22-HC-ketal-Ant 107 and anti-CD22-NHS-ketal-Ant 110 had no anti-proliferative effect on BT-474 cells. Non- targeted control ADCs thio-anti-CD22-HC-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 108 and thio-anti- CD22-H-thiopyridine-hydrazone-Ant 109 showed equivalent potency for inhibiting BT-474 cell growth as the HER2 -targeted ADCs (Figure 22), indicating lability of hydrazone-linked ADCs. Free drug PNU- 159682, administered in μM concentrations, caused cytotoxicity at all doses tested.\n\n\n[0471] Figure 24 shows a plot of MCF-7 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: thio-trastuzumab (HC A114C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 102, thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 103, thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-thiopyridine hydrazone-Ant 104, thio-trastuzumab (HC A114C)-NHS-ketal-Ant 105, trastuzumab-MCC- DMl 101, and thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE 106. Only thio-Tr-HC- maleimide-hydrazone-Ant 103 and thio-Tr-HC-thiopyridine-Ant 104 had anti-proliferative effects on HER2-low MCF7 cells, indicating lability of hydrazone-linked ADCs. All other ADCs tested (thio-Tr-HC-vc-MMAE 106, Tr-MCC-DMl 101, thio-Tr-HC-maleimide-ketal- Ant 102 and thio-Tr-NHS-ketal-Ant 105) had no effect on MCF7 cell growth.

Consistent with previous reports, trastuzumab was completely inactive on low HER2- expressing MCF7 cells. Non-targeted control ADCs thio-anti-CD22-HC-maleimide-ketal- Ant 107 and thio-anti-CD22-NHS-ketal-Ant 110 also did not inhibit growth of MCF7 cells, indicating lack of drug release from stable ketal linkers. Hydrazone-linked non-targeted control ADCs 108 and 109 showed anti-proliferative effects on MCF7 cells, indicating release of drug from labile hydrazone-linked ADCs. Free drug PNU-159682 administered in μM doses, caused cytotoxicity at all concentrations tested.\n\n\n[0473] Figure 26 shows a plot of doxorubicin-resistant (DoxRes)/HER2 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-maleimide ketal- Ant 102, thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 103, thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-thiopyridine hydrazone-Ant 104, thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-NHS-ketal-Ant 105, trastuzumab-MCC-DMl 101, and thio-trastuzumab (HC A114C)-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE \n\n 106. While 106 had no effect and Tr-MCC-DMl 101 had minimal effect on growth of DoxRes/HER2 cells, ketal-linked ADC 102 and 105 were active only at the highest concentrations tested, while hydrazone-linked ADC 103 and 104 potently inhibited growth of DoxRes/HER2 cells\n\n\n[0474] Figure 27 shows a plot of doxorubicin-resistant (DoxRes)/HER2 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: trastuzumab, thio-anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)- maleimide ketal-Ant 107, thio-anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 108, thio- anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)-thiopyridine hydrazone-Ant 109, anti-CD22-NHS-ketal-Ant 110, and PNU- 159682 free drug. Trastuzumab alone had no effect on growth of DoxRes/HER2 cells. Ketal-linked non-targeted control ADC 107 and 110 inhibited growth of DoxRes/HER2 cells only at the highest concentrations tested, while hydrazone-linked non- targeted control ADC 108 and 109 showed potent anti -proliferative activity on DoxRes/HER2 cells. Activities of all four non-targeted anti-CD22-Ant control ADC were similar to HER2-targeted thio-Ant ADC (Figure 26). Free drug PNU- 159682, administered in μM doses, inhibited growth at all concentrations tested.\n\n\n[0475] Figure 28 shows a plot of doxorubicin-resistant (DoxRes)/HER2 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-maleimide ketal- Ant 102, thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 103, thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-thiopyridine hydrazone-Ant 104, thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-NHS-ketal-Ant\n\n\n105, trastuzumab-MCC-DMl 101, and thio-trastuzumab (HC A114C)-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE\n\n\n106, all administered in the presence of verapamil (10 μg/m). Verapamil inhibits efflux of diverse drugs known to be substrates of the multi-drug resistance transporter MDR1/P- glycoprotein (PgP), which is highly expressed on DoxRes/HER2 cells. Addition of verapamil rendered the DoxRes/HER2 cells sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of Tr-MCC- DMl 101, indicating that DMl is a substrate for MDRl/PgP. Verapamil had no effect on the response to the other ADCs tested (102-106), indicating that the drug effects of these ADCs are not inhibited by NDRl/PgP.\n\n\n[0476] Figure 29 shows a plot of doxorubicin-resistant (DoxRes)/HER2 in vitro cell viability at 3 days versus concentrations of: trastuzumab, thio-anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)- maleimide ketal-Ant 107, thio-anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 108, thio- anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)-thiopyridine hydrazone-Ant 109, anti-CD22-NHS-ketal-Ant 110, and PNU- 159682 free drug, all administered in the presence of verapamil. All ADCs tested (107-110) were equally active in the presence of verapamil (compare to Figure 27), indicating \n\n that the Ant drug is not a substrate of MDRl/PgP.\n\n\n[0477] Table 3 summarizes the IC\n50\n values (ug/ml) for inhibition of SK-BR-3, BT-\n\n\n474, MCF7, doxorubicin-resistant (DoxRes), and doxorubicin-resistant (DoxRes) with verapamil cell proliferation of the test compounds of Figures 20-29. Comparing SK-BR-3 and BT-474 to MCF7, the maleimide-ketal-Ant and NHS-ketal-Ant ADC show target- dependent killing whereas hydrazone-linked-Ant ADC show target-independent, nonselective killing.\n\n\nTable 3 in vitro inhibition of SK-BR-3, BT-474, MCF7, doxorubicin-resistant\n\n\n(DoxRes), and doxorubicin-resistant (DoxRes) with verapamil cell proliferation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0478] The anti-proliferative effects of antibody-drug conjugates of Formula Ic\n\n\n(Table 6) were measured by the CellTiter-Glo\n®\n Assay (Example 9) against CD22 positive, B- lymphoma cell lines: BJAB, GRANTA, DoHH2 and SuDHL4 in 3 day continuous exposure studies. Jurkat cells (CD22 negative) were treated with the antibody-drug conjugates as a negative control.\n\n\n[0479] Table 4 summarizes the IC50 values (ug/ml) for inhibition of BJAB,\n\n\nGRANTA, DoHH2 SuDHL4 and Jurkat cell lines by test antibody-drug conjugate compounds in 3 day continuous exposure studies. The anti-CD22 antibody-drug conjugates 107-110 showed highly potent cell killing effects. Significant cell killing was observed with negative control anti-HER2 antibody drug conjugates 102-105. Significant cell killing was observed with anti-CD22 antibody-drug conjugates 107-110 on CD22 negative Jurkat cells.\n\n\nTable 4 in vitro inhibition of BJAB, GRANTA, DoHH2 SuDHL4 and Jurkat cell lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN VIVO SERUM CLEARANCE AND STABILITY IN MICE\n\n\n[0480] Serum clearance and stability of ADC may be investigated in nude, naive\n\n\n(without tumors received by exogenous grafts) mice according to the procedures in Example 10. A difference in the amount of total antibody and ADC indicates cleavage of the linker and separation of the antibody from its drug moiety.\n\n\n[0481] Stability of the conjugates was studied using HPLC analysis. The conjugate was incubated in ammonium acetate buffers at pH 4 and 5.2 at 37 °C. Each solution was then taken periodically and applied to an HPLC column using a method reported above. The amount of material released from the conjugate was determined and expressed as percent of released material.\n\n\nIN VIVO EFFICACY\n\n\n[0482] The therapeutic effect of the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) compounds and the improvement of their therapeutic efficacy in comparison with the parent drug, were assessed in animal models of human transplanted tumors. Mice bearing xenografts of human tumors were treated with suitable doses of antibody-drug conjugates, of PNU-159682 free drug, and naked antibody, at certain doses, and the tumor growth was recorded and compared in the different treatment groups. Figures 30-32 show the efficacy of the antibody-drug conjugates of Formula Ic by xenograft tumor inhibition in mice. [0483] The efficacy of the antibody-drug conjugates of the invention may be measured in vivo by implanting allografts or xenografts of cancer cells or primary tumors in rodents and treating the tumors with ADC according to the procedures of Example 12. Variable results are to be expected depending on the cell line, the specificity of antibody binding of the ADC to receptors present on the cancer cells, dosing regimen, and other factors. For example, the in vivo efficacy of anti-HER2 ADC may be measured by a high expressing HER2 transgenic explant mouse model. An allograft may be propagated from the Fo5 mmtv transgenic mouse which does not respond to, or responds poorly to, HERCEPTIN® therapy. Subjects are treated once with ADC and monitored over 3-6 weeks to measure the time to tumor doubling, log cell kill, and tumor shrinkage. Follow up dose- \n\n response and multi-dose experiments may be further conducted.\n\n\n[0484] Figure 30 shows a plot of the in vivo mean tumor volume change over time in\n\n\nBurkitt's lymphoma Bjab-luc xenograft tumors inoculated into CB 17 SCID mice after single dosing on day 0 with: (1) Vehicle, (2) thio-anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE 111 1 mg/kg, (3) thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 102 1 mg/kg, (4) thio- trastuzumab (HC A114C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 102 5 mg/kg, (5) thio-anti-CD22 (HC A114C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 107 1 mg/kg, (6) thio-anti-CD22 (HC A114C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 107 5 mg/kg, (7) thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 103 1 mg/kg, (8) thio-anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)-maleimide hydrazone-Ant 108 1 mg/kg, (9) PNU- 159682 free drug 8.77 ug/kg. All of the anti-CD22 conjugates (107, 108 and 111) showed target-specific tumor growth inhibition and the inhibitory activity of the ketal-linked anti- CD22 ADC 107 was dose-dependent. Free drug PNU-159682 and non-targeted control ADCs (102 and 103) at the equivalent dose had no effect on tumor growth. [0485] Table 5 shows the drug exposure level, average drug loading, tumor incidence, and responses for each test compound treated group of Figure 30 in the 48 day in vivo Bjab- luc xenograft tumor efficacy study. The Bjab-luc (EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma, luciferase expressing Bj ab cells) tumors express CD22 receptor protein (Poison et al (2009) Cancer Res. 69(6):2358-2364; US 2008/0050310; US 2005/0276812). CD22 is expressed only in the B-cell compartment and on the surface of most NHL cells (D'Arena et al (2000) Am J Hematol. 64:275-81; Olejniczak et al (2006) Immunol Invest. 35:93-114). Efficacy in inhibiting the Bjab-luc xenograft tumor in mice as a model system may predict the clinical response in treating patients with hematopoietic malignancies such as non-Hodgkins lymphoma. All of the anti-CD22 ADC (107, 108, 111) were effective in tumor inhibition as compared with Vehicle and control ADC (102 and 103) that did not bind the Bjab-luc cells. The absence of activity with control ADC indicates that the activity seen with the targeted ADC is specific, for example, it is not due to systemic release of free drug. In several cases, tumors were not only inhibited, but also partially and completely regressed by anti-CD22 conjugates (107, 108, 111). These data indicate that anti-CD22 surface antigen is a potentially effective target for the anthracyc line-derivative ADC of the invention. \n\n Table 5 in vivo Bjab-luc xenograft tumor efficacy study (Figure 30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0486] Figure 31 shows a plot of the in vivo mean tumor volume change over time in\n\n\nMMTV-HER2 Fo5 mammary allograft tumors inoculated into CRL nu/nu mice after single dosing on day 0 with: (1) Vehicle, (2) trastuzumab-MCC-DMl 101 5 mg/kg, (3) trastuzumab-MCC-DMl 101 10 mg/kg, (4) thio-trastuzumab (HC A114C)-maleimide ketal- \n\n Ant 102 5 mg/kg, (5) thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 102 10 mg/kg, (6) thio-anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 107 5 mg/kg, (7) thio-anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 107 10 mg/kg, (8) trastuzumab -MCC-DMl 101 5 mg/kg + thio-trastuzumab (HC Al 14C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 102 5 mg/kg. All of the anti-Her2 conjugates (101 and 102) showed target-specific tumor growth inhibition and the inhibitory activity was dose-dependent. Non-targeted control ADC 107 at equivalent doses had no effect on tumor growth.\n\n\n[0487] Table 6 shows the tumor growth inhibition at day 7, drug exposure level, average drug loading, tumor incidence and responses for each test compound treated group of Figure 31 in the 38 day in vivo MMTV-HER2 Fo5 mammary allograft tumor efficacy study (Phillips et al (2008) Cancer Res. 68(22):9280-9290; US 2005/0276812). The MMTV-HER2 Fo5 mammary allograft tumor is a trastuzumab-insensitive, HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell line. The targeted anti-HER2 ADC (101, 102, and combination of 101 and 102) were effective in tumor inhibition as compared with Vehicle and control ADC (107) that did not bind the MMTV-HER2 Fo5 cells. The absence of activity with control ADC indicates that the activity seen with the targeted ADC is specific, for example, it is not due to systemic release of free drug. Tumors were not only inhibited, but also partially and completely regressed by anti-HER2 conjugates (101, 102, and combination of 101 and 102). Combination trastuzumab-MCC-DMl 101 and thio-trastuzumab (HC A114C)-maleimide- ketal-Ant 102 showed no additional response beyond that of single agent 102. These data indicate that anti-HER2 surface antigen is a potentially effective target for the anthracycline- derivative ADC of the invention.\n\n\nTable 6 in vivo MMTV-HER2 Fo5 mammary allograft tumor efficacy study (Figure 31)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0488] Figure 32 shows a plot of the in vivo mean tumor volume change over time in\n\n\nLnCap-Ner xenograft tumors inoculated into male SCID-beige mice after single dosing on day 0 with: (1) Vehicle, (2) thio-anti-steap 1 (HC Al 14C)-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE 112 1 mg/kg, (3) thio-anti-steap 1 (HC A114C)-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE 112 3 mg/kg, (4) thio-anti-steap 1 (HC Al 14C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 113 1 mg/kg, (5) thio-anti-steap 1 (HC A114C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 113 3 mg/kg, (6) thio-anti-steap 1 (HC Al 14C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 113 6 mg/kg, (7) thio-anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 107 1 mg/kg, (8) thio-anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 107 3 mg/kg, (9) thio-anti-CD22 (HC Al 14C)-maleimide ketal-Ant 107 6 mg/kg. All of the anti-steapl conjugates (112 and 113) showed target- specific tumor growth inhibition and the inhibitory activity of the ketal-linked anti-steap 1 ADC 113 was dose-dependent. Non-targeted control ADC 107 at equivalent doses had no effect on tumor growth.\n\n\n[0489] Table 7 shows the drug exposure level, average drug loading, tumor incidence and responses for each test compound treated group of Figure 32 in the 49 day in vivo \n\n LnCap-Ner xenograft tumor efficacy study. Steapl (six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate) is a prostate-specific cell-surface antigen highly expressed in human prostate tumors (Hubert et al (1999) PNAS 96(25): 14523-14528). The LnCap cell line highly expresses steapl. The LnCap-Ner xenograft (Jin et al (2004) Cancer Res. 64:5489-5495) tumor inhibition study in mice may be an effective predictor for treatment of prostate cancer in patients. The targeted anti-steapl ADC (112 and 113) were effective in tumor inhibition as compared with Vehicle and control ADC (107) that did not bind the LnCap cells. The absence of activity with control ADC indicates that the activity seen with the targeted ADC is specific, for example, it is not due to systemic release of free drug. Tumors were not only inhibited, but also partially regressed by anti-HER2 conjugates (112 and 113). These data indicate that anti-steapl surface antigen is a potentially effective target for the anthracyc line- derivative ADC of the invention.\n\n\nTable 7 in vivo LnCap-Ner xenograft tumor efficacy study (Figure 32)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRODENT TOXICITY\n\n\n[0490] Antibody-drug conjugates and an ADC-minus control, \"Vehicle\", may be evaluated in an acute toxicity rat model (Brown et al (2002) Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 50:333-340) and according to Example 11. Toxicity of ADC is investigated by treatment of female Sprague-Dawley rats with the ADC and subsequent inspection and analysis of the effects on various organs. Based on gross observations (body weights), clinical pathology parameters (serum chemistry and hematology) and histopathology, the toxicity of ADC may be observed, characterized, and measured.\n\n\n[0491] A multi-day acute toxicity study in adolescent female rats may be conducted by one or more doses of a candidate ADC, a control ADC, free anthracycline derivative compound (PNU-159682) and a control Vehicle (day 0). Body weight is measured periodically. Clinical chemistry, serum enzymes and hematology analysis is also conducted periodically; concluding with complete necropsy with histopathological assessment. Toxicity signals included the clinical observation of weight loss, considering that weight loss, or weight change relative to animals dosed only with Vehicle in animals after dosing with ADC, is a gross and general indicator of systemic or localized toxicity. Hepatotoxicity may be measured by: (i) elevated liver enzymes such as AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), GGT (g-glutamyl transferase); (ii) increased numbers of mitotic and apoptotic figures; and (iii) hepatocyte necrosis. Hematolymphoid toxicity is observed by depletion of leukocytes, primarily granuloctyes (neutrophils), and/or platelets, and lymphoid organ involvement, i.e. atrophy or apoptotic activity. Toxicity is also noted by gastrointestinal tract lesions such as increased numbers of mitotic and apoptotic figures and degenerative entercolitis. \n\n ADMINISTRATION OF ANTIBODY-DRUG CONJUGATE PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS\n\n\n[0492] Therapeutic antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. The ADC will typically be administered parenterally, i.e. infusion, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal, bolus, intratumor injection or epidural (Shire et al (2004) J. Pharm. Sciences 93(6): 1390- 1402). Pharmaceutical formulations of therapeutic antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are typically prepared for parenteral administration with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form. An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) having the desired degree of purity is optionally mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients or stabilizers, in the form of a lyophilized formulation or an aqueous solution (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980) 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed.). [0493] The ADC may be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Any appropriate carrier or diluent may be used. Suitable carriers and diluents include physiological saline solution and Ringers dextrose solutions.\n\n\n[0494] Acceptable parenteral vehicles, diluents, carriers, excipients, and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include: (i) buffers such as phosphate, citrate, dibasic calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, and other organic acids; (ii) antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; (iii) preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; (iv) alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); (v) low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; (vi) hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; (vii) amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; (viii) monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, lactose, sucrose, mannitol, trehalose, sodium starch glycolate, sorbitol mannose, carboxymethylcellulose, or dextrins; (ix) chelating agents such as EDTA; (x) salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); (xi) non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG); (xii) glidants or granulating agents such as magnesium stearate, carboxymethylcellulose, talc, silica, and hydrogenated vegetable oil; (xiii) disintegrant such as crosprovidone, sodium starch glycolate or cornstarch; (xiv) thickening agents such as gelatin and polyethylene glycol; (xv) enteric \n\n coatings such as triethyl citrate; and/or (xvi) taste or texture modifiers, antifoaming agents, pigments, and dessicants. For example, lyophilized anti-ErbB2 antibody formulations are described in WO 97/04801, expressly incorporated herein by reference. An exemplary formulation of an ADC contains about 100 mg/ml of trehalose (2-(hydroxymethyl)-6-[3,4,5- trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydropyran-2-yl]oxy-tetrahydropyran-3,4,5-triol; Ci\n2\nH\n22\nOn; CAS Number 99-20-7) and about 0.1% TWEEN™ 20 (polysorbate 20; dodecanoic acid 2-[2-[3,4-bis(2-hydroxyethoxy)tetrahydrofuran-2-yl]-2-(2- hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy] ethyl ester; C\n2\n6H\n50\nOio; CAS Number 9005-64-5) at approximately pH 6.\n\n\n[0495] Pharmaceutical formulations of a therapeutic antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) may contain certain amounts of unreacted drug moiety (D), antibody- linker intermediate (Ab- L), and/or drug-linker intermediate (D-L), as a consequence of incomplete purification and separation of excess reagents, impurities, and by-products, in the process of making the ADC; or time/temperature hydrolysis or degradation upon storage of the bulk ADC or formulated ADC composition. For example, a formulation of the ADC may contain a detectable amount of free drug. Alternatively, or in addition to, it may contain a detectable amount of drug- linker intermediate. Alternatively, or in addition to, it may contain a detectable amount of the antibody. The active pharmaceutical ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacrylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).\n\n\n[0496] Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semi permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the ADC, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (US 3773919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. \n\n [0497] Formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared under sterile conditions and by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the ADC with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.\n\n\n[0498] Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials (ADC) in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose, povidone, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcelluose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxy-benzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.\n\n\n[0499] The pharmaceutical compositions of ADC may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butane-diol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables. [0500] The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the \n\n particular mode of administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 μg of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL/hr can occur. Subcutaneous (bolus) administration may be effected with about 1.5 ml or less of total volume and a concentration of about 100 mg ADC per ml. For ADC that require frequent and chronic administration, the subcutaneous route may be employed, such as by pre-filled syringe or autoinjector device technology.\n\n\n[0501] As a general proposition, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of\n\n\nADC administered per dose will be in the range of about 0.01-100 mg/kg, namely about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg/kg/day. For example, human patients may be initially dosed at about 1.5 mg ADC per kg patient body weight. The dose may be escalated to the maximally tolerated dose (MTD). The dosing schedule may be about every 3 weeks, but according to diagnosed condition or response, the schedule may be more or less frequent. The dose may be further adjusted during the course of treatment to be at or below MTD which can be safely administered for multiple cycles, such as about 4 or more.\n\n\n[0502] Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and nonaqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.\n\n\n[0503] Although oral administration of protein therapeutics are generally disfavored due to poor bioavailability due to limited absorption, hydrolysis or denaturation in the gut, formulations of ADC suitable for oral administration may be prepared as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the ADC. [0504] The formulations may be packaged in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water, for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Exemplary unit dosage formulations contain a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.\n\n\nI l l \n\n ANTIBODY-DRUG CONJUGATE METHODS OF TREATMENT\n\n\n[0505] Antibody-drug conjugates of the invention are useful as antitumor agents. A mammal, e.g. a human or animal, may therefore be treated by a method comprising administering thereto a pharmaceutically effective amount of a conjugate of formula 1 as hereinbefore defined. The condition of the human or animal may be ameliorated or improved in this way.\n\n\n[0506] Formula I ADC may be used to treat various diseases or disorders in a patient, such as cancer and autoimmune conditions including those characterized by the overexpression of a tumor-associated antigen. Exemplary conditions or disorders include benign or malignant tumors; leukemia and lymphoid malignancies; other disorders such as neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic, glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, stromal, blastocoelic, inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic disorders. Cancer types susceptible to ADC treatment include those which are characterized by the overexpression of certain tumor associated antigens or cell surface receptors, e.g. HER2.\n\n\n[0507] One method is for the treatment of cancer in a mammal, wherein the cancer is characterized by the overexpression of an ErbB receptor. The mammal optionally does not respond, or responds poorly, to treatment with an unconjugated anti-ErbB antibody. The method comprises administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody-drug conjugate compound. The growth of tumor cells that overexpress a growth factor receptor such as HER2 receptor or EGF receptor may be inhibitied by administering to a patient a Formula I ADC which binds specifically to said growth factor receptor and a chemotherapeutic agent wherein said antibody-drug conjugate and said chemotherapeutic agent are each administered in amounts effective to inhibit growth of tumor cells in the patient.\n\n\n[0508] A human patient susceptible to or diagnosed with a disorder characterized by overexpression of ErbB2 receptor, may be treated by administering a combination of a Formula I ADC and a chemotherapeutic agent. Such excessive activation may be attributable to overexpression or increased production of the ErbB receptor or an ErbB ligand. In one embodiment, a diagnostic or prognostic assay will be performed to determine whether the patient's cancer is characterized by excessive activation of an ErbB receptor. For example, ErbB gene amplification and/or overexpression of an ErbB receptor in the cancer may be determined. Various assays for determining such amplifϊcation/overexpression are available in the art and include 1HC, FISH and shed antigen assays. \n\n [0509] Examples of cancer to be treated herein include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma, as well as head and neck cancer.\n\n\n[0510] For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an ADC will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The ADC formulation is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 μg/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1-20 mg/kg) of ADC is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical dosage regimen might range from about 1 μg/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of ADC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg of patient weight. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg/kg of the ADC. Other dosage regimens may be useful.\n\n\nCOMBINATION THERAPY\n\n\n[0511] An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) may be combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with a second compound having anti -cancer properties. The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the ADC of the combination such that they do not adversely affect each other. \n\n [0512] The second compound may be a chemotherapeutic agent, cytotoxic agent, cytokine, growth inhibitory agent, anti-hormonal agent, aromatase inhibitor, protein kinase inhibitor, lipid kinase inhibitor, anti-androgen, antisense oligonucleotide, ribozyme, gene therapy vaccine, anti-angiogenic agent and/or cardioprotectant. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. A pharmaceutical composition containing an ADC may also have a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapeutic agent such as a tubulin-forming inhibitor, a topoisomerase inhibitor, or a DNA binder.\n\n\n[0513] Alternatively, or additionally, the second compound may be an antibody which binds or blocks ligand activation of tumor-associated antigen or receptor. The second antibody may be conjugated with a cytotoxic or chemotherapeutic agent, e.g., a macrocyclic depsipeptide, an auristatin, a calicheamicin, or a 1,8 bis-naphthalimide moiety. For example, it may be desirable to further provide antibodies which bind to EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, or vascular endothelial factor (VEGF) in the one formulation or dosing regimen. [0514] The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.\n\n\n[0515] In one embodiment, treatment with an ADC of the present invention involves the combined administration of an anticancer agent identified herein, and one or more chemotherapeutic agents or growth inhibitory agents. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers's instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in Chemotherapy Service Ed., M.C. Perry, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md. (1992).\n\n\n[0516] The ADC may be combined with an anti-hormonal compound; e.g., an anti- estrogen compound such as tamoxifen; an anti-progesterone such as onapristone (EP 616812); or an anti-androgen such as flutamide, in dosages known for such molecules. Where the cancer to be treated is hormone independent cancer, the patient may previously have been subjected to anti-hormonal therapy and, after the cancer becomes hormone independent, the anti-ErbB2 antibody (and optionally other agents as described herein) may be administered to the patient. It may be beneficial to also coadminister a cardioprotectant (to prevent or reduce \n\n myocardial dysfunction associated with the therapy) or one or more cytokines to the patient. In addition to the above therapeutic regimes, the patient may be subjected to surgical removal of cancer cells and/or radiation therapy.\n\n\n[0517] Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.\n\n\n[0518] The combination therapy may provide \"synergy\" and prove \"synergistic\", i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e. serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.\n\n\nMETABOLITES OF THE ANTIBODY-DRUG CONJUGATES\n\n\n[0519] Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of the ADC compounds described herein, to the extent such products are novel and unobvious over the prior art. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes novel and unobvious compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof. [0520] Metabolite products may be identified by preparing a radiolabeled (e.g. \n14\nC or\n\n\nH) ADC, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g. by MS, LC/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of \n\n metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well-known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the ADC compounds. [0521] Metabolites include the products of in vivo cleavage of the ADC where cleavage of any bond occurs that links the drug moiety to the antibody. Metabolic cleavage may thus result in the naked antibody, or an antibody fragment. The antibody metabolite may be linked to a part, or all, of the linker. Metabolic cleavage may also result in the production a drug moiety or part thereof. The drug moiety metabolite may be linked to a part, or all, of the linker.\n\n\nARTICLES OF MANUFACTURE\n\n\n[0522] In another embodiment, an article of manufacture, or \"kit\", containing ADC and materials useful for the treatment of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, or blister pack. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composition which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is an ADC. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice, such as cancer. [0523] In one embodiment, the article of manufacture may further comprise a second\n\n\n(or third) container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution, and a package insert indicating that the first and second compounds can be used to treat cancer. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n[0524] The compounds of the present invention, as prepared according to the following examples, were characterized by HPLC/MS analytical data; HPLC/MS data were collected following any one of methods 1, 2.\n\n\n[0525] HPLC/MS Analytic Method 1\n\n\n[0526] Waters 2795 Alliance HT HPLC system equipped with a 2996 Waters PDA \n\n detector and Micromass mod.

A linear gradient from 30-40% B (solvent A: 0.05% TFA in water, solvent B: 0.04% TFA in acetonitrile) was used and the eluant was directly ionized using the electrospray source. Data were collected by the Xcalibur data system and deconvolution was performed using ProMass (Novatia, LLC, New Jersey). Prior to LC/MS analysis, antibodies or antibody-drug conjugates (50 μg) are treated with PNGase F (2 units/ml; PROzyme, San Leandro, CA) for 2 hours at 37 °C to remove N-linked carbohydrates. [0591] Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC) samples were injected onto a \n\n Butyl HIC NPR column (2.5 μm, 4.6 mm x 3.5 cm) (Tosoh Bioscience) and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 70% B at 0.8 ml/min (A: 1.5 M ammonium sulfate in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7, B: 50 mM potassium phosphate pH 7, 20% isopropanol). An Agilent 1100 series HPLC system equipped with a multi wavelength detector and Chemstation software was used to resolve and quantitate antibody species with different ratios of drugs per antibody.\n\n\n[0592] Example 7 Conjugation of antibodies and anthracycline derivative drug- linker intermediates\n\n\n[0593] Generally, antibodies and anthracycline derivative drug-linker intermediates are conjugated according to the methods of US 7521541; US 7498298; US 2005/0276812; US 2008/0311134; and \"NEMORUBICIN METABOLITE AND ANALOG ANTIBODY- DRUG CONJUGATES AND METHODS\", PCT/US2009/031199, filed 16 Jan 2009, each of which are incorporated by reference.\n\n\n[0594] Conjugates quantization analysis by in-gel fluorescence detection was performed using ProXpress CCD-based scanner (PerkinElmer). Instrument excitation and emission filters were set at 480/30nm and 590/35nm respectively. Quantization analysis was performed using Profinder software provided with the instrument using the different amount of starting materials loaded on the gel as reference. Total loaded protein was then evaluated by Coomassie Blue protein staining.\n\n\n[0595] Example 8 Conjugation of cysteine engineered antibodies and maleimide drug-linker intermediates\n\n\n[0596] After the reduction and reoxidation procedures of Example 6, the cysteine engineered antibody is dissolved in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) buffer and chilled on ice. About 1.5 molar equivalents relative to engineered cysteines per antibody of an anthracycline derivative with a thiol-reactive functional group such as: pyridine-disulfide, e.g. drug-linker intermediates 53 or; bromo-acetamido and maleimide, e.g. drug-linker intermediates 51 and 52, is dissolved in DMSO, diluted in acetonitrile and water, and added to the chilled reduced, reoxidized antibody in PBS. After about one hour, an excess of maleimide is added to quench the reaction and cap any unreacted antibody thiol groups. The reaction mixture is concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration and the cysteine engineered antibody-drug conjugate is purified and desalted by elution through G25 resin in PBS, filtered through 0.2 μm filters under sterile conditions, and frozen for storage. [0597] By the procedures above, cysteine engineered antibody drug conjugates were \n\n prepared: 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 111, 112, and 113 (Table 2). Each of the cysteine engineered antibodies comprising antibody-drug conjugates 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 111, 112, and 113 were the heavy chain (HC) Al 14C (Kabat) cysteine engineered mutant (US 7521541). For the trastuzumab antibody, the Al 14C mutant by the Kabat numbering scheme is the same as the Al 18C mutant by the EU numbering scheme and the A 121C mutant by the Sequential numbering scheme.\n\n\n[0598] Cysteine engineered antibody drug conjugates with the maleimide caproyl\n\n\n(MC), valine -citrulline (vc), p-aminobenzyloxycarbamoyl (PAB), and auristatin drug (MMAE) drug-linker moieties (106, 111, and 112) were prepared by the method of Example 3 of US 2008/0311134, and Examples 27 and 29 of US 7498298, which are incorporated by reference, with drug-linker intermediate MC-vc -P AB-MMAE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0599] Example 9 In vitro cell proliferation assay\n\n\n[0600] Tumor cell lines breast carcinoma BT-474, SKB R-3, and MCF7 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.\n\n\n[0601] The in vitro potency of antibody-drug conjugates was measured by a cell proliferation assay (Figures 8-29). The CellTiter-Glo\n®\n Luminescent Cell Viability Assay is a commercially available (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), homogeneous assay method based on the recombinant expression of Coleoptera luciferase (US 5583024; US 5674713; US\n\n\n5700670). This assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, an indicator of metabolically active cells (Crouch et al (1993) J.\n\n\nImmunol. Meth. 160:81-88; US 6602677). The CellTiter-Glo\n®\n Assay was conducted in 96 well format, making it amenable to automated high-throughput screening (HTS) (Cree et al\n\n\n(1995) Anticancer Drugs 6:398-404). The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent (CellTiter-Glo\n®\n Reagent) directly to cells cultured in serum-supplemented medium.\n\n\n[0602] The homogeneous \"add-mix-measure\" format results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The substrate, \n\n Beetle Luciferin, is oxidatively decarboxylated by recombinant firefly luciferase with concomitant conversion of ATP to AMP and generation of photons. Viable cells are reflected in relative luminescence units (RLU). Data can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is presented as RLU, measured over time. Alternatively, photons from luminescence can be counted in a scintillation counter in the presence of a scintillant. The light units can be represented then as CPS - counts per second.\n\n\n[0603] Efficacy of ADC were measured by a cell viability assay employing the following protocol, adapted from CellTiter GIo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, Promega Corp. Technical Bulletin TB288 and Mendoza et al (2002) Cancer Res. 62:5485-5488:\n\n\n1. An aliquot of 50 μl of cell culture containing about 1000 or more cells, including: HER2-expressing and CD22-expressing cells, in medium was deposited in each well of a 96- well, opaque-walled, clear bottom plate.\n\n\n2. ADC (50 μl) was added to triplicate experimental wells to final concentration of 10 μg/mL, with \"no ADC\" control wells receiving medium alone, and incubated for 3 or more days.\n\n\n3. The plates were equilibrated to room temperature for approximately 30 minutes.\n\n\n4. CellTiter-Glo Reagent (100 μl) was added.\n\n\n5. The contents were mixed for 2 minutes on an orbital shaker to induce cell lysis.\n\n\n6. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes to stabilize the luminescence signal.\n\n\n7. Luminescence was recorded and reported in graphs as RLU = relative luminescence units.\n\n\n[0604] Example 10 Pharmacokinetics - Serum clearance and stability\n\n\n[0605] The disposition of antibody-drug conjugates in vivo is analyzed by measuring the serum concentrations of antibody and of drug conjugate after a single intravenous bolus dose into Sprague-Dawley rats. Concentrations of antibody-drug conjugates bearing at least one cytotoxic drug are measured with an ELISA that used a extracellular domain (ECD) protein for the capture and anti-anthracycline and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-mouse Fc antibody for detection. Total antibody concentrations in serum were measured with an ELISA that uses ECD for capture and anti-human-Fc HRP for detection, measuring antibody, both with and without conjugated anthracycline derivative. The serum concentration-time data from each animal is analyzed using a two-compartment model with \n\n IV bolus input, first-order elimination, and macro-rate constants (Model 8, WinNonlin Pro v.5.0.1, Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA).\n\n\n[0606] Example 11 Animal toxicity\n\n\n[0607] A 12 day acute toxicity study in adolescent female rats (100-125 gms) is conducted by a single injection of antibody-drug conjugate at about 1-10 mg/kg, and a control Vehicle at day 1. Injection of test article is typically administered as an intravenous bolus. Body weight is measured daily. Clinical chemistry, serum enzymes and hematology analysis is conducted periodically. Toxicity signals included the clinical observation of weight loss.\n\n\n[0608] Example 12 Tumor growth inhibition, in vivo efficacy mouse model\n\n\n[0609] All animal studies were performed in compliance with N1H guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Genentech.\n\n\n[0610] Efficacy studies were performed using SCID mice (Charles River\n\n\nLaboratories). The efficacy models for the studies exemplified in Figures 30-32 were employed as described (Poison et al (2009) Cancer Res. 69(6):2358-2364; Phillips et al (2008) Cancer Res. 68(22):9280-9290; US 2008/0050310; US 2005/0276812), evaluating tumor volume after a single intravenous dose. Transplant models were developed using tumors excised from a mouse bearing an intraperitoneal tumor, then serially passaged into recipient mice. For example, cells for implantation were washed and suspended in HBSS (Hyclone) and inoculated subcutaneous Iy into the flanks of female CB 17 ICR severe combined immunodeficiency mice (7-16 weeks of age from Charles Rivers Laboratories), in a volume of 0.2 mL/mouse. To test the efficacy of the antibody drug conjugates in vivo, approximately several million cells per SCID mouse were inoculated once and allowed to grow for about 10 to 60 days post-injection. When tumor volumes reached 150-200 mm\n3\n (typically Day 14 to Day 21 after inoculation), the mice were segregated into sample groups of 9-10 mice per group and the tumor volume was determined in each mouse. When mean tumor size reached the desired volume, the mice were divided into groups of 8 to 10 mice with the same mean tumor size and dosed intravenously via the tail vein with samples: ADCs, antibodies, or Vehicle. ADC doses were either measured as the mass of the conjugated cytotoxic small molecule drug per surface area of the mouse, or as a constant mass of ADC per mass of the mouse (e.g., 5 mg of ADC/kg mouse). In general, the drug loads on the antibodies in any given experiment were similar or normalized, so these two measures could \n\n be considered equivalent. Tumor volume was measured using calipers according to the formula: V (mm\n3\n) = 0.5A X B\n2\n, where A and B are the long and short diameters, respectively. Mice were euthanized before tumor volume reached 3000 mm\n3\n or when tumors showed signs of impending ulceration. Data collected from each experimental group were expressed as mean + SE."

Description\n\n\n\n\n NEW SALT FORMS OF AN AMINOIND AN DERIVATIVE\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application claims priority to United States Provisional Application No. 61/082,057 filed July 18, 2008, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND Field of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates generally to novel salt forms of R-(+)-N-propargyl-l- aminoindan (i.e. rasagiline base), to a compound of formula Ia, to processes for their preparation and isolation, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Ia) Relevant Background Rasagiline mesylate is an active pharmaceutical substance with an empirical formula of C12H13N.CH4O3S and a molecular weight of 267.34. Rasagiline mesylate is the international common accepted name for R-(+)-N-propargyl-l -aminoindan mesylate (or (li?)-Λ/-prop-2-yn-l-ylindan-l -amine mesylate or (li?)-2,3-dihydro-iV-2-propynyl-lH- inden-1 -amine mesylate), which is represented in Formula I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(I)\n\n\nRasagiline mesylate is a commercially marketed pharmaceutically active substance indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic\n\n\nParkinson's disease as initial monotherapy and as adjunct therapy to levodopa. Rasagiline is a selective irreversible inhibitor of the B-form of monoamine oxidase \n\n enzyme (MAO-B). In the United States, rasagiline mesylate is marketed under the name Azilect\n®\n for the treatment of early Parkinson's disease.\n\n\nRasagiline base and its salts are claimed in EP Patent Application No.\n\n\n0436492B1. In this reference, only rasagiline hydrochloride (m.p. = 179-181 \n0\nC, see example 3; m.p. = 183-185 \n0\nC, see example 4) and di-rasagiline L-tartrate (m.p. =\n\n\n175-177 \n0\nC, see example 6) are prepared. Aside from the melting point of these salts, no further polymorphic characterization data is provided.\n\n\nRasagiline mesylate is specifically claimed in EP Patent Application No. 0812190Bl. More precisely, in Example 6B of that patent, the product is obtained by treating the enantiopure rasagiline L-tartrate salt with methanesulfonic acid in isopropanol at reflux temperature for 30 minutes, allowing the reaction to cool to room temperature, and filtering the resulting precipitate. In this reference, other additional rasagiline salts are disclosed, i.e. rasagiline salts of tartrate (m.p. = 176.2- 177.3 \n0\nC), maleate (m.p. = 87.2-87.8 \n0\nC), sulphate (m.p. = 159.4-161.1 \n0\nC), hydrochloride (m.p. = 177.0-180.0 \n0\nC), tosylate (m.p. = 129.3-129.9 \n0\nC), fumarate (m.p. = 125.4-126.2 \n0\nC), phosphate (m.p. = 109.5-110.4 \n0\nC), esylate (m.p. not available), tannate (m.p. not available) and acetate (m.p. = 69.2-69.7\n0\nC). Again, however, aside from the melting point of some of these salts, no further characterization data is provided. EP Patent Application No. 1892233A1 relates to polymorphic forms of rasagiline oxalate and rasagiline edisylate.\n\n\nDifferent salt forms of the same pharmaceutically active moiety differ in their physical properties such as melting point, solubility, chemical reactivity, etc. These properties may appreciably influence pharmaceutical properties such as dissolution rate and bioavailability.\n\n\nIn addition, polymorphism is very common among pharmaceutical substances. It is commonly defined as the ability of any substance to exist in two or more crystalline phases that have a different arrangement and/or conformation of the molecules in the crystal lattice. Different polymorphic forms of the same pharmaceutically active moiety also differ in their physical properties such as melting point, solubility, chemical reactivity, etc. These properties may appreciably influence pharmaceutical properties such as dissolution rate and bioavailability. \n\n Therefore, it would be desirable to prepare and characterize new rasagiline salt forms. Further, it would be desirable to have reliable processes for producing these rasagiline salts forms. Additionally, the various rasagiline salt forms could be used to prepare improved pharmaceutical compositions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates generally to novel salt forms of R-(+)-N- propargyl-1-aminoindan (i.e. rasagiline base), to a compound of formula Ia, to processes for their preparation and isolation, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\n\nReference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the invention. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein.\n\n\nIt will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention and specific examples provided herein without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention that come within the scope of any claims and their equivalents.\n\n\nThe present invention relates generally to novel salt forms of R-(+)-N- propargyl-1-aminoindan (i.e. rasagiline base), to a compound of formula Ia, to processes for their preparation and isolation, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Ia) The novel salt forms of rasagiline have been prepared and structurally characterized as described herein and are referred to herein as rasagiline benzoate crystalline form (Form I), rasagiline galactarate crystalline form (Form I), rasagiline gluconate amorphous form, rasagiline D-glucuronate amorphous form, rasagiline tosylate crystalline form (Form I), rasagiline phosphate amorphous form, rasagiline \n\n maleate crystalline form (Form I), rasagiline succinate crystalline form (Form I), rasagiline acetate crystalline forms (Forms I and II), rasagiline L-tartrate salt crystalline form (Form I), rasagiline L-hemihydrate salt crystalline (Form I), rasagiline fumarate crystalline form (Form I), rasagiline hydrochloride crystalline forms (Forms I and II), and rasagiline besylate crystalline form (Form I).\n\n\nThe solid form salts of rasagiline of the present invention have been characterized by means of Powder X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra.\n\n\nSurprisingly, a selected group of the novel salt forms of rasagiline of the present invention exhibit an excellent flowability, which might enhance their pharmaceutical properties as compared with the rasagiline mesylate salt that is currently marketed.\n\n\nFlowability affects the ease with which the material is handled during processing into a pharmaceutical product. Namely, when flowability is very poor, problems occur with handling and processing during milling and formulating. The flowability of rasagiline salts can be measured using the Hausner ratio, which is a value calculated by dividing the tapped bulk density of the rasagiline salt by the freely settled bulk density of the rasagiline salt. The freely settled bulk density is calculated by pouring a known weight of material into a measuring cylinder and recording the volume. The tapped density is calculated by tapping the cylinder against a surface for a specified number of times and recording again the new volume. See Henry H. Hausner, \"Friction Conditions in a Mass of Metal Powders,\" Int. J. Powder Metall. Vol. 3, 1967, pp 7-13.\n\n\nA low Hausner ratio indicates a high flowability. In this regard, it is generally accepted that a Hausner ratio equal to or higher than 1.46 indicates a very poor flowing material, which is rarely acceptable for manufacturing purposes. Therefore, a Hausner ratio less than 1.46 indicates an acceptable flowing material. Table 1 below summarizes the terms used to describe the flowability character with reference to the Hausner ratio value. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\nWe have found that the rasagiline mesylate obtained by the processes disclosed in the prior art, which all make use of isopropanol as a crystallization solvent, shows poor flowability characteristics. Namely, the rasagiline mesylate obtained after a standard crystallization from isopropanol has a Hausner ratio equal to 1.72 (i.e. very, very poor flow character according to Table 1). Surprisingly, the selected group of rasagiline salts of the present invention, which comprises rasagiline succinate salt Form I, rasagiline L-hemitartrate salt Form I, rasagiline besylate salt Form I, and rasagiline hydrochloride salt Form II, have been found to show excellent flowability characteristics. Thus, the selected group of rasagiline salts of the present invention are better handled and processed during milling and formulating, as compared with the rasagiline mesylate salt that is currently marketed. Consequently, the selected salt forms of rasagiline of the invention are more suitable for pharmaceutical formulation use.\n\n\nFurther, the selected salt forms of rasagiline of the present invention exhibit a high solubility profile in water, i.e. higher than 50 mg/mL, and hence also show enhanced pharmaceutical properties regarding the dissolution rate and bioavailability.\n\n\nIn addition, the selected crystalline salt forms of rasagiline of the present invention have been found to be stable in terms of visual aspect, chemical purity and of polymorphic form either after 10 months of storage or after being submitted to accelerated stability conditions (4O\n0\nC and 75% RH) for one and/or two months, which also makes them suitable for pharmaceutical formulation use.\n\n\nAdditionally, the formation of the selected rasagiline salts of the invention might be an efficient way of purifying rasagiline base. \n\n A first aspect of the present invention includes rasagiline benzoate salt and processes for obtaining it.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention relates to a new rasagiline benzoate crystalline Form I and processes for obtaining it.

The mixture was mixed thoroughly.\n\n\nThe chromatograph was equipped with a 265 nm detector and the flow rate was 1.4 mL per minute.\n\n\nThe test samples were prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of sample to obtain 10 mg per mL in diluent. For the majority of the rasagiline salts, the diluent was prepared by mixing 89 mL of mobile phase, 10 mL of 2-propanol and 1 mL of diethylamine. For the rasagiline succinate, the rasagiline hydrochloride, the rasagiline L-hemitartrate, and the rasagiline besylate salts, the diluent was prepared by mixing 49 mL of mobile phase, 50 mL of ethanol and 1 mL diethylamine. The injection volume was 5 μL.\n\n\nX-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD)\n\n\nThe XRD diffractograms were obtained using a RX SIEMENS D5000 diffractometer with a vertical goniometer, a copper anodic tube, and radiation CuKa , λ= 1, 54056 A. Single Crystal X-ray Analysis\n\n\nX-ray data for a single crystal of rasagiline hydrochloride Form II was collected at 293 (2)K on an Enraf-Nonius CAD 4 diffractometer using Mo-K\na\n radiation.\n\n\nInfrared Spectra (IR) Fourier transform IR spectra were acquired on a Thermo Nicolet Nexus spectrometer, and samples were characterized in potassium bromide pellets. \n\n Particle Size Distribution Method\n\n\nThe particle size for rasagiline salts was measured using a Malvern Mastersizer S particle size analyzer with an MSl-Small Volume Sample Dispersion Unit stirred cell. A 300RF mm lens and a beam length of 2.4 mm were used. Samples of rasagiline salts were suspended in Isopar G containing Soybean Lecithin (1.5 g in 200 mL of Isopar G). The suspensions were mixed and then sonicated for 3 minutes to thoroughly disperse the rasagiline salt particles. Volume distributions were obtained for three times. After completing the measurements, the sample cell was emptied and cleaned, refilled with suspending medium, and the sampling procedure repeated again. For characterization, the values of D\n10\n, D50 and D90 (by volume) were specifically listed, each one being the mean of the nine values available for each characterization parameter.\n\n\nThe notation Dx [also written as D(v, 0.X)] means that X% of the particles have a diameter less than a specified diameter D.

Description\n\n\n\n\n PROSTAGLANDIN E2 BINDING PROTEINS AND USES THEREOF Reference to Related Applications\n\n\nThis application is a non-provisional application claiming priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/134,264, filed July 8, 2008, and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/197,258, filed October 23, 2008, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to binding proteins and compositions thereof, for example antibodies and antigen binding portions specific to lipid metabolites such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE\n2\n), and methods of making, characterizing, and using them in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases.\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\nBioactive lipids such as prostaglandin (PG), thromboxane (TX), leukotriene (LT), and sphingosine- 1 -phosphate play a critical physiological role in the etiology of various disorders. (Wymann, MP and Schneiter R, Nat. Rev. MoI. Cell. Biol. 9(2): 162-\n\n\n76(2008)). During inflammation, cellular phospholipases, especially phospholipases A2 and C, are activated and degrade cell membrane phospholipids to arachidonic acid (AA). AA is metabolized by two major routes, the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipooxygenase (LO) pathways. The COX pathway produces prostaglandins (PGD\n2\n, PGE\n2\n, PGF\n2α\n, prostacyclin or PGI\n2\n, and thromboxane A2 or TXA\n2\n). The LO pathway has two branches; the 5-LO pathway produces leukotrienes (e.g., LTA4, LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, and LTF4) and the 15-LO pathway produces lipoxins (e.g., LXA4, LXB4). Prostanoids such as prostaglandin (PG), thromboxane (TX) and leukotriene (LT) have various physiological activities for maintaining local homeostasis in the body (The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Gilman, et al., eds., 7th Ed., p. 660, Macmillan Publishing Co., New York (1985)). The products of COX, PG G2/ PG H2, are converted to specific PGs by the actions of tissue specific isomerases to yield PGI\n2\n, TXA\n2\n, PGD\n2\n, PGE\n2\n, and PGF\n2α\n. The biological functions of PGs are mediated by tissue-specific cell surface rhodopsin-like seven transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The precise physiological/pathological role of each PG is determined by the \n\n cellular context, receptor expression profile, ligand affinity, and differential coupling to signal transduction pathways (Haluska et al, Annu. Rev. Pharm. Tox. 10:213 (1989); Prostanoids and their Receptors. In Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry, p. 643, Pergamon Press, Oxford (1990)). PGs play a wide variety of physiological roles in the regulation of modulation of vasomotricity, the sleep/wake cycle, intestinal secretion, lipolysis, glomerular filtration, mast cell degranulation, neurotransmission, platelet aggregation, leuteolysis, myometrial contraction and labor, inflammation and arthritis, patent ductus arteriosus, cell growth and differentiation, and immune responses generally. Patho-physiologically, PGs have been implicated in a variety of diseases including pain and inflammation, cancer, neurological diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension.\n\n\nProstaglandin E\n2\n (PGE\n2\n) is a member of the prostanoid family. PGE\n2\n participates widely in the contraction and relaxation of the gastrointestinal tract, secretion of gastric acid, relaxation of smooth muscle, and release of neurotransmitters. Four subtype receptors for PGE\n2\n have been identified, including EPl, EP2, EP3, and EP4 (Negishi, M. et al., J. Lipid Mediators Cell Signalling, 12:379-391 (1995)), each of which is involved in a different signal transduction pathway.\n\n\nPGE\n2\n is the main product of the COX pathway of AA metabolism. It is the major PG synthesized in the joints and plays an important role in inflammation and the pathogenesis of arthritis. Five PGE\n2\n synthases have been identified. (Smith WL, Am. J. Physiol. 263(2 Pt 2):F181-91 (1992)). Of these five, membrane PGE synthase (mPGES)- 1 appears to be the key PGE\n2\n convertase enzyme responsible for PGE\n2\n production. MPGES-I displays the highest catalytic activity relative to other PGE synthases and functions in conjunction with COX-I and/or COX-2, to convert PGH\n2\n to PGE\n2\n. Studies using mPGES-1 KO mice (Kamei, D., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 279(32):33684-95 (2004); Trebino, C.E., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100(15):9044-9 (2003), specific PGE\n2\n receptor isoform KO mice (McCoy, J.M., et al. J. Clin. Invest., 110(5):651-8 (2002); Majima, M., et al. Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 24(10):524-9 (2003); and Amano, H., et al., J. Exp. Med., 197(2):221-32 (2003); and anti-PGE\n2\n specific antibodies (Portanova, J.P., et al., J. Exp. Med., 184(3):883-91 (1996); Zhang, Y., et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 283(3): 1069-75(1997) suggest that PGE\n2\n plays a major role in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), pain and inflammation and cancer development. In the \n\n absence of mPGES-1, levels of COX-I, COX-2, and other PGE2 synthases remain relatively unaltered. The mPGES-1 KO mice are viable, fertile, and develop normally compared to wild type mice. However, they display a drastic reduction in both basal levels of PGE2 production as well as in PGE2 production from macrophages following challenge with various inflammatory stimuli. In addition, production of TXA2 is increased. The mPGES- 1 KO mice show reduced incidence and severity of arthritis development and show resistance to pain and inflammation in various models. Several laboratories have independently generated various EP receptor isoform KO mice. These mice are viable, fertile and develop normally. Studies using specific EP isoform KO mice demonstrate that the various functions of PGE2 are mediated via specific EP isoforms. For example, the lack of EP 4 isoform clearly affects the severity of arthritis development in mice, whereas the lack of EP3 influences tumor development and progression by modulating VEGF production by stromal cells and angiogenesis.\n\n\nDefects in the biosynthesis and metabolism of prostaglandins are now believed to play an important part in the etiology of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. For example, the synovial tissues from patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis produce larger amounts of PGE\n2\n and prostaglandin F\n2α\n (PGF \n2α\n) compared to the synovial tissues from unaffected subjects (Blotman, F., et al, Rev. Rhum. MaI. Osteoartic, 46(4):243-7 (1979)). Similarly, an increased synthesis of PGE\n2\n and PGF \n2α\n occurs in patients exhibiting systemic and gastrointestinal symptoms secondary to food intolerance. Thus, migraine headaches secondary to the ingestion of certain foods could be the result of an increased synthesis of 2-series prostaglandins. Multiple sclerosis is also associated with an imbalance in the normal levels of the prostaglandins, PGEi and PGE\n2\n. Many aspects of reproduction, for example, fertility, pregnancy and labor, may be regulated by prostaglandins. Prostaglandins also play a major role in reproductive physiology.\n\n\nExcessive prostaglandin synthesis causes dysmenorrhea and parturition, which may be induced by administering prostaglandins intravenously or by insertion of a prostaglandin pessary. (Wang L. et al., Occup. Environ. Med. 61(12): 1021-1026 (2004)). Excessive synthesis of PGE\n2\n also plays a major role in disorders of reproduction, such as infertility, repeated miscarriage, preeclampsia, and eclampsia. A need therefore exists for antibodies specific to PGE\n2\n that block or modulate its biological functions, which may be used to \n\n prevent and treat the diseases associated with excess production of PGE2 as well as diagnostic purposes.\n\n\nThe generation of a highly specific, high affinity (K\nD\n is about 30OpM) anti-PGE\n2\n mAb, 2B5, has been reported. (Mnich SJ, et al. J. Immunol. 155(9):4437-44 (1995)). The efficacy of 2B5 relative to indomethacin, a COX- 1,2 inhibitor, was determined in animal models of pain and inflammation in mice and adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. (Portanova JP et al., J. Exp. Med. 184(3):883-91 (1996)). These studies clearly showed that 2B5 was as effective as indomethacin in reducing pain and inflammation as well as the severity of arthritis, suggesting that PGE\n2\n is a key participant in the COX- 1 , 2 pathway of AA metabolism in these animal models.\n\n\nInhibition of pan-PG production by COX-inhibitors has been a well-established therapeutic strategy for decades. Two isoforms of COX, COX-I and COX-2, are known, each of which are encoded by a distinct gene. The two isoforms carry out essentially the same catalytic reaction and have similar tertiary structures (Garavito RM, et al., Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 32: 183-206 (2003)). COX-I is constitutively expressed in nearly all tissues and is believed to be largely responsible for the normal \"house keeping\" functions, such as gastric cytoprotection and homeostasis. COX-2, by contrast, is constitutively expressed in particular tissues, and is highly inducible at sites of inflammation and cancer. Thus, COX-2-mediated PG production is thought to play an important role at the site of inflammation and cancer. The traditional non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), e.g., aspirin, indomethacin, ibuprofen) inhibit both COX isoforms. These compounds are the most widely used drugs for pain, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), and cardiovascular diseases and now are under consideration for the prevention of colon cancer and AD. The main liabilities of traditional NSAIDs are gastric and renal adverse events, in high-risk populations, which are believed to be due to inhibition of COX-I. Therefore, the second generation of NSAIDs, the COX-2 selective inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib, Celebrex; rofecoxib, Vioxx; valdecoxib, Bextra), are believed to have a better therapeutic profile. This assumption has resulted in their widespread use for pain, RA, and OA. Since the approval of the first COX-2 inhibitor in 1999 the combined sales of COX-2 inhibitors in 2004 was approximately US $ 5 billion. However, recently some COX-2 selective inhibitors were taken off the market, and are under FDA review, due to cardiovascular side-effects in high risk patients for certain \n\n COX-2 inhibitors. The liabilities associated with COX inhibitors probably arose due to their ability to inhibit all PGs, and in particular due to their ability to differentially interfere with PGI\n2\n and TXA\n2\n production, both of which play an important role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis (Martinez-Gonzalez J. et al., Curr. Pharm. Des. 13(22):2215-2227 (2007)). The inhibition of COX may make more AA available to the LO pathways, thus increasing the production of leukotrienes and lipoxins, which may contribute to COX inhibition-associated adverse effects. Recent studies using COX-I and/or COX-2 knockout mice and COX-I and COX-2 specific inhibitors also suggest that assumptions concerning the physiological roles of the two COX-isoforms may not be correct. (Loftin, CD., et al. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 68-69: 177-85 (2002)). These studies suggest that both COX- 1 and COX-2 play an important role in supplying PGs to maintain tissue homeostasis and both isoforms may contribute to disease development, such as pain, inflammation and cancer. Therefore, blocking detrimental PGE\n2\n downstream of COX-I and COX-2 pathway with a specific antibody appears to be an attractive approach for the treatment of certain human diseases.\n\n\nAnother example of an important bioactive prostaglandin is PGD\n2\n. PGD\n2\n is the major cyclooxygenase product of arachidonic acid produced from mast cells on immunological challenge (Lewis, et al., J. Immunol. 129: 1627-1631 (1982)). Activated mast cells, a major source Of PGD\n2\n, are one of the key players in driving the allergic response in conditions such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic dermatitis and other diseases (Brightling, et al., Clin. Exp. Allergy 33:550-556 (2003)). Recent studies have shown that PGD\n2\n exerts its effects through two different G-protein- coupled receptors (GPCRs), the D-prostanoid receptor (DP) and the chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on T helper type-2 cells (CRTH2), expressed in various human tissues. The PGD\n2\n/CRTH2 system mediates the chemotaxis of eosinophils, basophils, and Th2 cells, which are involved in the induction of allergic inflammation (Ulven T et al., Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 6(13): 1427-1444 (2006)). Many of the actions of PGD\n2\n are mediated through its action on the D-type prostaglandin (\"DP\") receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor expressed on epithelium and smooth muscle. In asthma, the respiratory epithelium has long been recognized as a key source of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that drive the progression of the disease (Holgate, et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 162: 113-117 (2000)). In an experimental \n\n murine model of asthma, the DP receptor is dramatically up-regulated on airway epithelium on antigen challenge (Matsuoka, et al., Science 287:2013-2017 (2000)). The DP receptor is involved in human allergic rhinitis, a frequent allergic disease that is characterized by the symptoms of sneezing, itching, rhinorea and nasal congestion. DP antagonists have been shown to be effective at alleviating the symptoms of allergic rhinitis in multiple species, and more specifically have been shown to inhibit the antigen- induced nasal congestion, the most manifest symptom of allergic rhinitis (Jones, et al., Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 167:A218 (2003); Arimura, et al., S-5751. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 298(2):411-9 (2001)). DP antagonists are also effective in experimental models of allergic conjunctivitis and allergic dermatitis (Arimura et al., S-5751. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 298(2):411-9 (2001); Torisu, et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. 12:5361-5378 (2004)). A need therefore also exists for antibodies specific to PGD\n2\n and blocking or modulating its biological functions therefore may be used to prevent and treat the diseases associated with excess production of PGD\n2\n.\n\n\nSphingosine- 1 -phosphate (SlP) is another example of a bioactive lipid that induces many cellular effects, including those that result in platelet aggregation, cell proliferation, cell morphology, tumor cell invasion, endothelial cell chemotaxis, and endothelial cell in vitro angiogenesis. SlP receptors are therefore good targets for therapeutic applications such as wound healing and tumor growth inhibition. SlP signals cells in part via a set of G protein-coupled receptors named SlPl, S1P2, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 (formerly called EDG-I, EDG-5, EDG-3, EDG-6, and EDG-8, respectively). These receptors share 50-55% amino acid and cluster identity with three other receptors (LPAl, LP A2, and LPA3 (formerly EDG-2, EDG-4 and EDG-7)) for the structurally-related lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). (Ishii, I. et al., MoI. Pharmacol. 58(5):895-902 (2000)). A conformational shift is induced in the G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) when the ligand binds to that receptor, causing GDP to be replaced by GTP on the α-subunit of the associated G-proteins and subsequent release of the G-proteins into the cytoplasm. The α -subunit then dissociates from the βγ-subunit, and each subunit can then associate with effector proteins, which activate second messengers leading to a cellular response. Eventually the GTP on the G-proteins is hydrolyzed to GDP, and the subunits of the G- proteins re-associate with each other and then with the receptor. Amplification plays a major role in the general GPCR pathway. The binding of one ligand to one receptor leads \n\n to the activation of many G-proteins, each capable of associating with many effector proteins, leading to an amplified cellular response. S lP receptors make good drug targets, because individual receptors are both tissue- and response-specific. Tissue specificity of the SlP receptors is important, because development of an agonist or antagonist selective for one receptor localizes the cellular response to tissues containing that receptor, limiting unwanted side effects. Response specificity of the SlP receptors is also important because it allows for development of agonists or antagonists that initiate or suppress certain cellular responses without affecting other responses. For example, the response specificity of the SlP receptors could allow for an S lP mimetic that initiates platelet aggregation without affecting cell morphology.\n\n\nSlP is formed as a metabolite of sphingosine in its reaction with sphingosine kinase, and is abundantly stored in platelet aggregates where high levels of sphingosine kinase exist and sphingosine lyase is absent. SlP is released during platelet aggregation, accumulates in serum and is also found in malignant ascites. S lP biodegradation most likely proceeds via hydrolysis by ectophosphohydrolases, specifically the sphingosine 1- phosphate phosphohydrolases. A need therefore exists for antibodies specific to SlP for modulating its biological functions either by blocking its interaction with receptors or stabilizing SlP and enhancing its biological effects, for use in preventing or treating autimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and cancers.\n\n\nDue to the role of PGE2 in a variety of human disorders, therapeutic strategies have been designed to inhibit or counteract PGE2 activity. In particular, therapeutic antibodies suitable for delivery to humans that bind to, and neutralize, PGE2 have not been reported. There exists a need in the art for improved antibodies capable of binding and neutralizing PGE2.\n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to binding proteins specific to lipid metabolites, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE\n2\n).

Various aspects of the invention relate to antibodies and antibody fragments, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof, as well as nucleic acids, recombinant expression vectors and host cells for making such antibodies and fragments. Methods of using the antibodies of the invention to detect PGE\n2\n, to inhibit one or more PGE\n2\n activities, either in vitro or in vivo; and to regulate gene expression are also encompassed by the invention.\n\n\nUnless otherwise defined herein, scientific and technical terms used in connection with the present invention shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. The meaning and scope of the terms should be clear, however, in the event of any latent ambiguity, definitions provided herein take precedent over any dictionary or extrinsic definition. Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. In this application, the use of \"or\" means \"and/or\" unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, the use of the term \"including\", as well as other forms, such as \"includes\" and \"included\", is not limiting. Also, terms such as \"element\" or \"component\" encompass both elements and components comprising one unit and elements and components that comprise more than one subunit unless specifically stated otherwise.\n\n\nGenerally, nomenclatures used in connection with, and techniques of, cell and tissue culture, molecular biology, immunology, microbiology, genetics and protein and nucleic acid chemistry and hybridization described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. The methods and techniques of the present invention are generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as \n\n described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification unless otherwise indicated. Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are performed according to manufacturer's specifications, as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The nomenclatures used in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques are used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.\n\n\nThat the present invention may be more readily understood, select terms are defined below.\n\n\nThe term \"polypeptide\" as used herein, refers to any polymeric chain of amino acids. The terms \"peptide\" and \"protein\" are used interchangeably with the term polypeptide and also refer to a polymeric chain of amino acids. The term \"polypeptide\" encompasses native or artificial proteins, protein fragments and polypeptide analogs of a protein sequence. A polypeptide may be monomeric or polymeric.\n\n\nThe term \"isolated protein\" or \"isolated polypeptide\" is a protein or polypeptide that by virtue of its origin or source of derivation is not associated with naturally associated components that accompany it in its native state; is substantially free of other proteins from the same species; is expressed by a cell from a different species; or does not occur in nature. Thus, a polypeptide that is chemically synthesized or synthesized in a cellular system different from the cell from which it naturally originates will be \"isolated\" from its naturally associated components. A protein may also be rendered substantially free of naturally associated components by isolation, using protein purification techniques well known in the art.\n\n\nThe term \"recovering\" as used herein, refers to the process of rendering a chemical species such as a polypeptide substantially free of naturally associated components by isolation, e.g., using protein purification techniques well known in the art. \n\n The terms \"Prostaglandin E2\" (abbreviated herein as PGE2), as used herein, refers to the prostaglandin having the following structure or a variant thereof that retains some or all PGE\n2\n activities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Biological activity\" as used herein, refers to inherent biological properties of the cytokine. Biological properties Of PGE\n2\n include but are not limited to binding to a PGE\n2\n receptor.\n\n\nThe terms \"specific binding\" or \"specifically binding\", as used herein, in reference to the interaction of an antibody, a protein, or a peptide with a second chemical species, mean that the interaction is dependent upon the presence of a particular structure (e.g., an antigenic determinant or epitope) on the chemical species; for example, an antibody recognizes and binds to a specific protein structure rather than to proteins generally. If an antibody is specific for epitope \"A\", the presence of a molecule containing epitope A (or free, unlabeled A), in a reaction containing labeled \"A\" and the antibody, will reduce the amount of labeled A bound to the antibody.\n\n\nThe term \"antibody\", as used herein, broadly refers to any immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule comprised of four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains, or any functional fragment, mutant, variant, or derivation thereof, which retains the essential epitope binding features of an Ig molecule. Such mutant, variant, or derivative anitbody formats are known in the art. Nonlimiting embodiments of which are discussed below.\n\n\nIn a full-length antibody, each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as HCVR or VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CHl, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as LCVR or VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with \n\n regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy- terminus in the following order: FRl, CDRl, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. Immunoglobulin molecules can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., IgG 1, IgG2, IgG 3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2) or subclass.\n\n\nThe term \"antigen-binding portion\" or \"antigen binding fragment\" of an antibody (or simply \"antibody portion\"), as used herein, refers to one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., PGE\n2\n). The antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Such antibody embodiments may also have bispecific, dual specific, or multi- specific formats, specifically binding to two or more different antigens. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term \"antigen-binding portion\" of an antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CHl domains; (ii) a F(ab')2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CHl domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546, Winter et al., PCT publication WO 90/05144 Al), which comprises a single variable domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR). Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) Science 242:423- 426; and Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl Acad. ScL USA 85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also encompassed within the term \"antigen-binding portion\" of an antibody. Other forms of single chain antibodies, such as diabodies are also encompassed. Diabodies are bivalent, bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites (see e.g., Holliger, P., et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444- 6448; Poljak, R.J., et al. (1994) Structure 2: 1121-1123). Such antibody binding portions \n\n are known in the art (Kontermann and Dubel eds., Antibody Engineering (2001) Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 790 (ISBN 3-540-41354-5).\n\n\nThe term \"antibody construct\" as used herein refers to a polypeptide comprising one or more antigen binding portions of the invention linked to a linker polypeptide or an immunoglobulin constant domain. Linker polypeptides comprise two or more amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds and are used to link one or more antigen binding portions. Such linker polypeptides are well known in the art (see e.g., Holliger, P., et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 90:6444-6448; Poljak, R. J., et al. (1994) Structure 2: 1121-1123). An immunoglobulin constant domain refers to a heavy or light chain constant domain. Human IgG heavy chain and light chain constant domain amino acid sequences are known in the art and are represented in Table 1.\n\n\nTable 1: Sequence Of Human IgG Heavy Chain Constant Domain And Light Chain Constant Domain\n\n\n \n\n Still further, an antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof may be part of a larger immunoadhesion molecule, formed by covalent or noncovalent association of the antibody or antibody portion with one or more other proteins or peptides. Examples of such immunoadhesion molecules include use of the streptavidin core region to make a tetrameric scFv molecule (Kipriyanov, S. M., et al. (1995) Human Antibodies and\n\n\nHybridomas 6:93-101) and use of a cysteine residue, a marker peptide and a C-terminal polyhistidine tag to make bivalent and biotinylated scFv molecules (Kipriyanov, S. M., et al. (1994) MoI. Immunol. 31 : 1047-1058). Antibody portions, such as Fab and F(ab')2 fragments, can be prepared from whole antibodies using conventional techniques, such as papain or pepsin digestion, respectively, of whole antibodies. Moreover, antibodies, antibody portions and immunoadhesion molecules can be obtained using standard recombinant DNA techniques, as described herein.\n\n\nAn \"isolated antibody\", as used herein, is intended to refer to an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds PGE\n2\n is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than PGE\n2\n). An isolated antibody that specifically binds PGE\n2\n may, however, have cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as Prostaglandin El (PGEi) molecules. Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.\n\n\nThe term \"human antibody\", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example in the CDRs and in particular CDR3. However, the term \"human antibody\", as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences.\n\n\nThe term \"recombinant human antibody\", as used herein, is intended to include all human antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies expressed using a recombinant expression vector transfected into a \n\n host cell (described further in Section II C, below), antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library (Hoogenboom H.R., (1997) TIB Tech. 15:62-70; Azzazy H., and Highsmith W.E., (2002) Clin. Biochem. 35:425-445; Gavilondo J.V., and Larrick J. W. (2002) BioTechniques 29: 128-145; Hoogenboom H., and Chames P. (2000) Immunology Today 21 :371-378 ), antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes (see e.g., Taylor, L. D., et al. (1992) Nucl. Acids Res. 20:6287-6295; Kellermann S-A., and Green L.L. (2002) Current Opinion in Biotechnology 13:593-597; Little M. et al. (2000) Immunology Today 21:364-370) or antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involves splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments, however, such recombinant human antibodies are subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline VH and VL sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo. One embodiment provides fully human antibodies capable of binding PGE\n2\n which can be generated using techniques well known in the art, such as, but not limited to, using human Ig phage libraries such as those disclosed in Jermutus et al., PCT publication No. WO 2005/007699 A2.\n\n\nThe term \"chimeric antibody\" refers to antibodies which comprise heavy and/or light chain variable region sequences from one species and constant region sequences from another species, such as antibodies having murine heavy and light chain variable regions linked to human constant regions.\n\n\nThe term \"CDR-grafted antibody\" refers to antibodies which comprise heavy and/or light chain variable region sequences from one species but in which the sequences of one or more of the CDR regions of VH and/or VL are replaced with CDR sequences of another species, such as antibodies having murine heavy and light chain variable regions in which one or more of the murine CDRs (e.g., CDR3) has been replaced with human CDR sequences. \n\n The term \"humanized antibody\" refers to antibodies which comprise heavy and light chain variable region sequences from a non-human species (e.g., a mouse) but in which at least a portion of the VH and/or VL sequence has been altered to be more \"human-like\", i.e., more similar to human germline variable sequences. One type of humanized antibody is a CDR-grafted antibody, in which human CDR sequences are introduced into non-human VH and VL sequences to replace the corresponding nonhuman CDR sequences. In one embodiment, humanized anti-PGE2 antibodies and antigen binding portions are provided. Such antibodies were generated by obtaining murine anti- PGE\n2\n monoclonal antibodies using traditional hybridoma technology followed by humanization using in vitro genetic engineering, such as those disclosed in Kasaian et al PCT publication No. WO 2005/123126 A2.\n\n\nThe terms \"Kabat numbering\", \"Kabat definitions\" and \"Kabat labeling\" are used interchangeably herein. These terms, which are recognized in the art, refer to a system of numbering amino acid residues which are more variable (i.e., hypervariable) than other amino acid residues in the heavy and light chain variable regions of an antibody, or an antigen binding portion thereof (Kabat et al. (1971) Ann. NY Acad, ScL 190:382-391 and, Kabat, E.A., et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242). For the heavy chain variable region, the hypervariable region ranges from amino acid positions 31 to 35 for CDRl, amino acid positions 50 to 65 for CDR2, and amino acid positions 95 to 102 for CDR3. For the light chain variable region, the hypervariable region ranges from amino acid positions 24 to 34 for CDRl, amino acid positions 50 to 56 for CDR2, and amino acid positions 89 to 97 for CDR3.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms \"acceptor\" and \"acceptor antibody\" refer to the antibody or nucleic acid sequence providing or encoding at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98% or 100% of the amino acid sequences of one or more of the framework regions. In some embodiments, the term \"acceptor\" refers to the antibody amino acid or nucleic acid sequence providing or encoding the constant region(s). In yet another embodiment, the term \"acceptor\" refers to the antibody amino acid or nucleic acid sequence providing or encoding one or more of the framework regions and the constant region(s). In a specific embodiment, the term \"acceptor\" refers to a human antibody amino acid or nucleic acid sequence that provides or encodes at least 80%, preferably, at \n\n least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98%, or 100% of the amino acid sequences of one or more of the framework regions. In accordance with this embodiment, an acceptor may contain at least 1, at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, or at least 10 amino acid residues that does (do) not occur at one or more specific positions of a human antibody. An acceptor framework region and/or acceptor constant region(s) may be, e.g., derived or obtained from a germline antibody gene, a mature antibody gene, a functional antibody (e.g., antibodies well-known in the art, antibodies in development, or antibodies commercially available).\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"CDR\" refers to the complementarity determining region within antibody variable sequences. There are three CDRs in each of the variable regions of the heavy chain and the light chain, which are designated CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3, for each of the variable regions. The term \"CDR set\" as used herein refers to a group of three CDRs that occur in a single variable region capable of binding the antigen. The exact boundaries of these CDRs have been defined differently according to different systems. The system described by Kabat (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987) and (1991)) not only provides an unambiguous residue numbering system applicable to any variable region of an antibody, but also provides precise residue boundaries defining the three CDRs. These CDRs may be referred to as Kabat CDRs. Chothia and coworkers (Chothia &Lesk, J. MoI. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987) and Chothia et al., Nature 342:877-883 (1989)) found that certain sub-portions within Kabat CDRs adopt nearly identical peptide backbone conformations, despite having great diversity at the level of amino acid sequence. These sub-portions were designated as Ll, L2 and L3 or Hl, H2 and H3 where the \"L\" and the \"H\" designates the light chain and the heavy chains regions, respectively. These regions may be referred to as Chothia CDRs, which have boundaries that overlap with Kabat CDRs. Other boundaries defining CDRs overlapping with the Kabat CDRs have been described by Padlan (FASEB J. 9: 133-139 (1995)) and MacCallum (J MoI Biol 262(5):732-45 (1996)). Still other CDR boundary definitions may not strictly follow one of the above systems, but will nonetheless overlap with the Kabat CDRs, although they may be shortened or lengthened in light of prediction or experimental findings that particular residues or groups of residues or even entire CDRs do not significantly impact antigen binding. The methods used herein may utilize CDRs defined according to any of these systems, although preferred embodiments use Kabat or Chothia defined CDRs. \n\n As used herein, the term \"canonical\" residue refers to a residue in a CDR or framework that defines a particular canonical CDR structure as defined by Chothia et al., J. MoI. Biol. 196:901-907 (1987); Chothia et al., J. MoI. Biol. 227:799 (1992). According to Chothia et al., critical portions of the CDRs of many antibodies have nearly identical peptide backbone confirmations despite great diversity at the level of amino acid sequence. Each canonical structure specifies primarily a set of peptide backbone torsion angles for a contiguous segment of amino acid residues forming a loop.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms \"donor\" and \"donor antibody\" refer to an antibody providing one or more CDRs. In a preferred embodiment, the donor antibody is an antibody from a species different from the antibody from which the framework regions are obtained or derived. In the context of a humanized antibody, the term \"donor antibody\" refers to a non-human antibody providing one or more CDRs.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"framework\" or \"framework sequence\" refers to the remaining sequences of a variable region minus the CDRs. Because the exact definition of a CDR sequence can be determined by different systems, the meaning of a framework sequence is subject to correspondingly different interpretations. The six CDRs (CDR-Ll, CDR-L2, and CDR-L3 of light chain and CDR-Hl, CDR-H2, and CDR-H3 of heavy chain) also divide the framework regions on the light chain and the heavy chain into four sub-regions (FRl, FR2, FR3 and FR4) on each chain, in which CDRl is positioned between FRl and FR2, CDR2 between FR2 and FR3, and CDR3 between FR3 and FR4. Without specifying the particular sub-regions as FRl, FR2, FR3 or FR4, a framework region, as referred by others, represents the combined FRs within the variable region of a single, naturally occurring immunoglobulin chain. As used herein, a FR represents one of the four sub- regions, and FRs represent two or more of the four sub-regions constituting a framework region. See Tables 5 and 6 for exemplary FR sequences.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"germline antibody gene\" or \" germline antibody gene fragment\" refers to an immunoglobulin sequence encoded by non- lymphoid cells that have not undergone the maturation process that leads to genetic rearrangement and mutation for expression of a particular immunoglobulin. (See, e.g., Shapiro et al., Crit. Rev. Immunol. 22(3): 183-200 (2002); Marchalonis et al., Adv Exp Med Biol. 484:13-30 (2001)). One of the advantages provided by various embodiments of the present invention stems from the recognition that germline antibody genes are more likely than mature \n\n antibody genes to conserve essential amino acid sequence structures characteristic of individuals in the species, hence less likely to be recognized as from a foreign source when used therapeutically in that species.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"key\" residues refer to certain residues within the variable region that have more impact on the binding specificity and/or affinity of an antibody, in particular a humanized antibody. A key residue includes, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: a residue that is adjacent to a CDR, a potential glycosylation site (can be either N- or O-glycosylation site), a rare residue, a residue capable of interacting with an antigen, a residue capable of interacting with a CDR, a canonical residue, a contact residue between heavy chain variable region and light chain variable region, a residue within the Vernier zone, and a residue in the region that overlaps between the Chothia definition of a variable heavy chain CDRl and the Kabat definition of the first heavy chain framework.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"humanized antibody\" is an antibody or a variant, derivative, analog or fragment thereof which immunospecifically binds to an antigen of interest and which comprises a framework (FR) region having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human antibody and a complementary determining region (CDR) having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non-human antibody. As used herein, the term \"substantially\" in the context of a CDR refers to a CDR having an amino acid sequence at least 80%, preferably at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98% or at least 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of a non-human antibody CDR. A humanized antibody comprises substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains (e.g., Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2, FabC, Fv) in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin (i.e., donor antibody) and all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. Preferably, a humanized antibody also comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody contains both the light chain as well as at least the variable domain of a heavy chain. The antibody also may include the CHl, hinge, CH2, CH3, and CH4 regions of the heavy chain. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody only contains a humanized light chain. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody only contains a humanized heavy chain. In specific embodiments, a humanized \n\n antibody only contains a humanized variable domain of a light chain and/or humanized heavy chain.\n\n\nThe humanized antibody can be selected from any class of immunoglobulins, including IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA and IgE, and any isotype, including without limitation IgG 1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. The humanized antibody may comprise sequences from more than one class or isotype, and particular constant domains may be selected to optimize desired effector functions using techniques well-known in the art.\n\n\nThe framework and CDR regions of a humanized antibody need not correspond precisely to the parental sequences, e.g., the donor antibody CDR or the consensus framework may be mutagenized by substitution, insertion and/or deletion of at least one amino acid residue so that the CDR or framework residue at that site does not correspond to either the donor antibody or the consensus framework. In a preferred embodiment, such mutations, however, will not be extensive. Usually, at least 80%, preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95% of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the parental FR and CDR sequences. As used herein, the term \"consensus framework\" refers to the framework region in the consensus immunoglobulin sequence. As used herein, the term \"consensus immunoglobulin sequence\" refers to the sequence formed from the most frequently occurring amino acids (or nucleotides) in a family of related immunoglobulin sequences (See, e.g., Winnaker, From Genes to Clones (Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany 1987). In a family of immunoglobulins, each position in the consensus sequence is occupied by the amino acid occurring most frequently at that position in the family. If two amino acids occur equally frequently, either can be included in the consensus sequence.\n\n\nAs used herein, \"Vernier\" zone refers to a subset of framework residues that may adjust CDR structure and fine-tune the fit to antigen as described by Foote and Winter (1992) J. MoI. Biol. 224:487-499). Vernier zone residues form a layer underlying the CDRs and may impact on the structure of CDRs and the affinity of the antibody.\n\n\nThe term \"multivalent binding protein\" is used in this specification to denote a binding protein comprising two or more antigen binding sites. The multivalent binding protein is preferably engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites, and is \n\n generally not a naturally occurring antibody. The term \"multispecific binding protein\" refers to a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins as used herein, are binding proteins that comprise two or more antigen binding sites and are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins. Such DVD binding proteins may be monospecific, i.e., capable of binding one antigen or multispecific, i.e., capable of binding two or more antigens. DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are refered to a DVD-Ig™. Each half of a DVD-Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, and a light chain DVD polypeptide, and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"neutralizing\" refers to neutralization of biological activity of a cytokine or a lipid metabolite when a binding protein specifically binds the cytokine or a lipid metabolite. Preferably a neutralizing binding protein is a neutralizing antibody whose binding to PGE\n2\n results in inhibition of a biological activity of PGE\n2\n. Preferably the neutralizing binding protein binds PGE\n2\n and reduces a biological activity of PGE\n2\n by at least about 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 85% or more. Inhibition of a biological activity of PGE\n2\n by a neutralizing binding protein can be assessed by measuring one or more indicators of PGE\n2\n biological activity well known in the art. For example inhibition of PGE\n2\n induced calcium influx by EP4 assay using HEK293 cells over-expressing EP4 receptor (see Example 1.1. C 1).\n\n\nThe term \"activity\" includes activities such as the binding specificity/affinity of an antibody for an antigen, for example, an anti- PGE\n2\n antibody that binds to an PGE\n2\n antigen and/or the neutralizing potency of an antibody, for example, an anti- PGE\n2\n antibody whose binding to PGE\n2\n inhibits the biological activity of PGE\n2\n, e.g., for example inhibition of PGE\n2\n induced calcium influx by EP4 assay using HEK293 cells over-expressing EP4 receptor (see Example 1.1. C 1).\n\n\nThe term \"epitope\" includes any polypeptide determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. In certain embodiments, epitope determinants include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl, or sulfonyl, and, in certain embodiments, may have \n\n specific three-dimensional structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics. An epitope is a region of an antigen that is bound by an antibody. In certain embodiments, an antibody specifically binds an antigen when it preferentially recognizes its target antigen in a complex mixture of proteins and/or macromolecules.\n\n\nThe term \"surface plasmon resonance\", as used herein, refers to an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example, using the BIAcore system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, NJ). For further descriptions, see Jδnsson, U., et al. (1993) .4MM. Biol. Clin. ^J\n.\n: 19-26; Jδnsson, U., et al. (1991) Biotechniques 11 :620-627; Johnsson, B., et al. (1995) J. MoI. Recognit. 8: 125-131; and Johnnson, B., et al. (1991) Anal. Biochem. 198:268-277.\n\n\nThe term \" k\non\n \", as used herein, is intended to refer to the on rate constant for association of an antibody to an antigen to form an antibody/antigen complex as is known in the art.\n\n\nThe term \" k\noff\n \", as used herein, is intended to refer to the off rate constant for dissociation of an antibody from an antibody/antigen complex as is known in the art.\n\n\nThe term \" K\nD\n \", as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction as is known in the art.\n\n\nThe term \"labeled binding protein\" as used herein, refers to a protein with a label incorporated that provides for the identification of the binding protein. Preferably, the label is a detectable marker, e.g., incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid or attachment to a polypeptide of biotinyl moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g., streptavidin containing a fluorescent marker or enzymatic activity that can be detected by optical or colorimetric methods). Examples of labels for polypeptides include, but are not limited to, the following: radioisotopes or radionuclides (e.g., H\n;\n \n14\nC \n35\nS, \n90\nY, \n99\nTc, \n111\nIn, \n125\n1, \n131\nI, \n177\nLu, \n166\nHo, or \n153\nSm); fluorescent labels (e.g., FITC, rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors); enzymatic labels (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase); chemiluminescent markers; biotinyl groups; predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine \n\n zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags); and magnetic agents, such as gadolinium chelates.\n\n\nThe term \"antibody conjugate\" refers to a binding protein, such as an antibody, chemically linked to a second chemical moiety, such as a therapeutic or cytotoxic agent. The term \"agent\" is used herein to denote a chemical compound, a mixture of chemical compounds, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made from biological materials. Preferably the therapeutic or cytotoxic agents include, but are not limited to, pertussis toxin, taxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1- dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof.\n\n\nThe terms \"crystal\", and \"crystallized\" as used herein, refer to an antibody, or antigen binding portion thereof, that exists in the form of a crystal. Crystals are one form of the solid state of matter, which is distinct from other forms such as the amorphous solid state or the liquid crystalline state. Crystals are composed of regular, repeating, three-dimensional arrays of atoms, ions, molecules (e.g., proteins such as antibodies), or molecular assemblies (e.g., antigen/antibody complexes). These three- dimensional arrays are arranged according to specific mathematical relationships. The fundamental unit, or building block, that is repeated in a crystal is called the asymmetric unit. Repetition of the asymmetric unit in an arrangement that conforms to a given, well-defined crystallographic symmetry provides the \"unit cell\" of the crystal. Repetition of the unit cell by regular translations in all three dimensions provides the crystal. See Giege, R. and Ducruix, A. Barrett, Crystallization of Nucleic Acids and Proteins, a Practical Approach, 2nd ed., pp. 20 1-16, Oxford University Press, New York, New York, (1999).\n\n\nOne embodiment provides a composition for the release of a binding protein wherein the composition comprises a formulation which in turn comprises a crystallized binding protein, crystallized antibody construct or crystallized antibody conjugate as disclosed above and an ingredient; and at least one polymeric carrier. Preferably the polymeric carrier is a polymer selected from one or more of the group consisting of: \n\n poly (acrylic acid), poly (cyanoacrylates), poly (amino acids), poly (anhydrides), poly (depsipeptide), poly (esters), poly (lactic acid), poly (lactic -co-glycolic acid) or PLGA, poly (b-hydroxybutryate), poly (caprolactone), poly (dioxanone); poly (ethylene glycol), poly ((hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide, poly [(organo)phosphazene], poly (ortho esters), poly (vinyl alcohol), poly (vinylpyrrolidone), maleic anhydride- alkyl vinyl ether copolymers, pluronic polyols, albumin, alginate, cellulose and cellulose derivatives, collagen, fibrin, gelatin, hyaluronic acid, oligosaccharides, glycaminoglycans, sulfated polyeaccharides, blends and copolymers thereof. Preferably the ingredient is selected from the group consisting of albumin, sucrose, trehalose, lactitol, gelatin, hydroxypropyl-β- cyclodextrin, methoxypolyethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol. Another embodiment provides a method for treating a mammal comprising the step of administering to the mammal an effective amount of the composition disclosed above.\n\n\nThe term \"polynucleotide\" as referred to herein means a polymeric form of two or more nucleotides, either ribonucleotides or deoxynucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide. The term includes single and double stranded forms of DNA but preferably is double-stranded DNA.\n\n\nThe term \"isolated polynucleotide\" as used herein shall mean a polynucleotide (e.g., of genomic, cDNA, or synthetic origin, or some combination thereof) that, by virtue of its origin, the \"isolated polynucleotide\" is not associated with all or a portion of a polynucleotide with which the \"isolated polynucleotide\" is found in nature; is operably linked to a polynucleotide that it is not linked to in nature, or does not occur in nature as part of a larger sequence.\n\n\nThe term \"vector\", as used herein, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a \"plasmid\", which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into \n\n the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \"recombinant expression vectors\" (or simply, \"expression vectors\"). In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, \"plasmid\" and \"vector\" may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector. However, the invention is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors, such as viral vectors (e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), which serve equivalent functions.\n\n\nThe term \"operably linked\" refers to a juxtaposition wherein the components described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. A control sequence \"operably linked\" to a coding sequence is ligated in such a way that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the control sequences. \"Operably linked\" sequences include both expression control sequences that are contiguous with the gene of interest and expression control sequences that act in trans or at a distance to control the gene of interest. The term \"expression control sequence\" as used herein refers to polynucleotide sequences that are necessary to effect the expression and processing of coding sequences to which they are ligated. Expression control sequences include appropriate transcription initiation, termination, promoter and enhancer sequences; efficient RNA processing signals such as splicing and polyadenylation signals; sequences that stabilize cytoplasmic mRNA; sequences that enhance translation efficiency (i.e., Kozak consensus sequence); sequences that enhance protein stability; and when desired, sequences that enhance protein secretion. The nature of such control sequences differs depending upon the host organism; in prokaryotes, such control sequences generally include promoter, ribosomal binding site, and transcription termination sequence; in eukaryotes, generally, such control sequences include promoters and transcription termination sequence. The term \"control sequences\" is intended to include components whose presence is essential for expression and processing, and can also include additional components whose presence is advantageous, for example, leader sequences and fusion partner sequences. Protein constructs of the present invention may be expressed, and purified using expression vectors and host cells known in the art, \n\n including expression cassettes, vectors, recombinant host cells, and methods for the recombinant expression and proteolytic processing of recombinant polyproteins and pre- proteins from a single open reading frame (e.g., WO 2007/014162).\n\n\n\"Transformation\", as defined herein, refers to any process by which exogenous DNA enters a host cell. Transformation may occur under natural or artificial conditions using various methods well known in the art. Transformation may rely on any known method for the insertion of foreign nucleic acid sequences into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell. The method is selected based on the host cell being transformed and may include, but is not limited to, viral infection, electroporation, lipofection, and particle bombardment. Such \"transformed\" cells include stably transformed cells in which the inserted DNA is capable of replication either as an autonomously replicating plasmid or as part of the host chromosome. They also include cells that transiently express the inserted DNA or RNA for limited periods of time.\n\n\nThe term \"recombinant host cell\" (or simply \"host cell\"), as used herein, is intended to refer to a cell into which exogenous DNA has been introduced. It should be understood that such terms are intended to refer not only to the particular subject cell, but, to the progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term \"host cell\" as used herein. Preferably host cells include prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells, insect cells, or cells selected from any of the Kingdoms of life. Preferred eukaryotic cells include protist, fungal, plant and animal cells. Most preferably host cells include but are not limited to the prokaryotic cell line E. coli; mammalian cell lines CHO, HEK 293 and COS; the insect cell line Sf9; and the fungal cell S. cerevisiae.\n\n\nStandard techniques may be used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, and tissue culture and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques may be performed according to manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The foregoing techniques and procedures may be generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification. \n\n See e.g., Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)).\n\n\n\"Transgenic organism\", as known in the art and as used herein, refers to an organism having cells that contain a transgene, wherein the transgene introduced into the organism (or an ancestor of the organism) expresses a polypeptide not naturally expressed in the organism. A \"transgene\" is a DNA construct, which is stably and operably integrated into the genome of a cell from which a transgenic organism develops, directing the expression of an encoded gene product in one or more cell types or tissues of the transgenic organism.\n\n\nThe term \"regulate\"and \"modulate\" are used interchangeably, and, as used herein, refers to a change or an alteration in the activity of a molecule of interest (e.g., the biological activity of PGE\n2\n). Modulation may be an increase or a decrease in the magnitude of a certain activity or function of the molecule of interest. Exemplary activities and functions of a molecule include, but are not limited to, binding characteristics, enzymatic activity, cell receptor activation, and signal transduction.\n\n\nCorrespondingly, the term \"modulator,\" as used herein, is a compound capable of changing or altering an activity or function of a molecule of interest (e.g., the biological activity PGE\n2\n). For example, a modulator may cause an increase or decrease in the magnitude of a certain activity or function of a molecule compared to the magnitude of the activity or function observed in the absence of the modulator. In certain embodiments, a modulator is an inhibitor, which decreases the magnitude of at least one activity or function of a molecule. Exemplary inhibitors include, but are not limited to, proteins, peptides, antibodies, peptibodies, carbohydrates or small organic molecules. Peptibodies are described, e.g., in WOO 1/83525.\n\n\nThe term \"agonist\", as used herein, refers to a modulator that, when contacted with a molecule of interest, causes an increase in the magnitude of a certain activity or function of the molecule compared to the magnitude of the activity or function observed in the absence of the agonist. Particular agonists of interest may include, but are not limited to, PGE\n2\n or polypeptides, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, or any other molecules that bind to PGE\n2\n. \n\n The term \"antagonist\" or \"inhibitor\", as used herein, refer to a modulator that, when contacted with a molecule of interest causes a decrease in the magnitude of a certain activity or function of the molecule compared to the magnitude of the activity or function observed in the absence of the antagonist. Particular antagonists of interest include those that block or modulate the biological or immunological activity of PGE\n2\n. Antagonists and inhibitors of PGE\n2\n may include, but are not limited to, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, or any other molecules, which bind to PGE2.\n\n\nThe term \"inhibit binding to the receptor\" refers to the ability of the binding protein to prevent the binding of PGE\n2\n to one or more of its receptors. Such inhibition of binding to the receptor would result in diminishing or abolishing the biological activity mediated by binding of PGE\n2\n to its receptor or receptors.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"effective amount\" refers to the amount of a therapy which is sufficient to reduce or ameliorate the severity and/or duration of a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof, prevent the advancement of a disorder, cause regression of a disorder, prevent the recurrence, development, onset or progression of one or more symptoms associated with a disorder, detect a disorder, or enhance or improve the prophylactic or therapeutic effect(s) of another therapy (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agent).\n\n\nThe term \"sample\", as used herein, is used in its broadest sense. A \"biological sample\", as used herein, includes, but is not limited to, any quantity of a substance from a living thing or formerly living thing. Such living things include, but are not limited to, humans, mice, rats, monkeys, dogs, rabbits and other animals. Such substances include, but are not limited to, blood, serum, urine, synovial fluid, cells, organs, tissues, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment the binding protein is a CDR grafted antibody or antigen binding portion thereof capable of binding PGE\n2\n.

Preferably, the antibodies of the invention are neutralizing human anti-PGE\n2\n and/or human anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies.\n\n\nA. Method Of Making Anti Prostaglandin E\n2\n Antibodies\n\n\nThe antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention may be generated by any art-known method, such as, for example, hybridoma, microbe (e.g., phage, bacteria, yeast), recombinant, ribosome, mRNA, and DNA displays, or a combination thereof. Many methods can be used to manipulate antibodies to modify antibody properties including humanization, affinity maturation, antibody isotype switching, physiochemical property and pharmacokinetic profile improvement, etc., which are well known in the art.\n\n\n1. Anti-Prostaglandin E\n2\n Monoclonal Antibodies Using Hybridoma Technology\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma, recombinant, phage, and yeast display \n\n technologies, or a combination thereof. Monoclonal antibodies can be produced, for example, using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught, for example, in Harlow et al, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling, et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T- Cell Hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981). The term \"monoclonal antibody\" as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term \"monoclonal antibody\" refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced.\n\n\nMethods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art. In one embodiment, the present invention provides methods of generating monoclonal antibodies as well as antibodies produced by the method comprising culturing a hybridoma cell secreting an antibody of the invention wherein, preferably, the hybridoma is generated by fusing splenocytes isolated from a mouse immunized with an antigen of the invention with myeloma cells and then screening the hybridomas resulting from the fusion for hybridoma clones that secrete an antibody able to bind a polypeptide of the invention (See Example 1.2). Briefly, mice can be immunized with a carrier protein conjugated PGE\n2\n known as hapten-carrier protein conjugates. Here, the hapten is PGE\n2\n and carrier protein can be any of bovine thyroglobulins, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin etc. In a preferred embodiment, the PGE\n2\n-thyroglobulin conjugate is administered with an adjuvant to stimulate the immune response. Such adjuvants include complete or incomplete Freund's adjuvant, RIBI (muramyl dipeptides) or ISCOM (immunostimulating complexes). Such adjuvants may protect the polypeptide from rapid dispersal by sequestering it in a local deposit, or they may contain substances that stimulate the host to secrete factors that are chemotactic for macrophages and other components of the immune system. Preferably, if a polypeptide is being administered, the immunization schedule will involve two or more administrations of the polypeptide, spread out over several weeks.\n\n\nAfter immunization of an animal with a PGE\n2\n-thyroglobulin conjugate, antibodies and/or antibody -producing cells may be obtained from the animal. An anti- PGE\n2\n antibody-containing serum is obtained from the animal by bleeding or sacrificing the \n\n animal. The serum may be used as it is obtained from the animal, an immunoglobulin fraction may be obtained from the serum, or the anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies may be purified from the serum. Serum or immunoglobulins obtained in this manner are polyclonal, thus having a heterogeneous array of properties.\n\n\nOnce an immune response is detected, e.g., antibodies specific for the antigen\n\n\nPGE\n2\n are detected in the mouse serum, the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well-known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells, for example cells from cell line SP20 available from the ATCC. Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding PGE\n2\n. Ascites fluid, which generally contains high levels of antibodies, can be generated by immunizing mice with positive hybridoma clones.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, antibody-producing immortalized hybridomas may be prepared from the immunized animal. After immunization, the animal is sacrificed and the splenic B cells are fused to immortalized myeloma cells as is well known in the art. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane, supra. In a preferred embodiment, the myeloma cells do not secrete immunoglobulin polypeptides (a non-secretory cell line). After fusion and antibiotic selection, the hybridomas are screened using PGE2, or a portion thereof, or a cell expressing PGE\n2\n. In a preferred embodiment, the initial screening is performed using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) or a radioimmunoassay (RIA), preferably an ELISA. An example of ELISA screening is provided in WO 00/37504.\n\n\nAnti- PGE\n2\n antibody-producing hybridomas are selected, cloned and further screened for desirable characteristics, including robust hybridoma growth, high antibody production and desirable antibody characteristics, as discussed further below. Hybridomas may be cultured and expanded in vivo in syngeneic animals, in animals that lack an immune system, e.g., nude mice, or in cell culture in vitro. Methods of selecting, cloning and expanding hybridomas are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the hybridomas are mouse hybridomas, as described above. In another preferred embodiment, the hybridomas are produced in a non-human, non-mouse species such as rats, sheep, pigs, goats, cattle or horses. In another \n\n embodiment, the hybridomas are human hybridomas, in which a human non-secretory myeloma is fused with a human cell expressing an anti- PGE\n2\n antibody.\n\n\nAntibody fragments that recognize specific epitopes may be generated by known techniques. For example, Fab and F(ab')2 fragments of the invention may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab')2 fragments). F(ab')2 fragments contain the variable region, the light chain constant region and the CHl domain of the heavy chain.\n\n\n2. Anti-Prostaglandin E\n2\n monoclonal antibodies using SLAM\n\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, recombinant antibodies are generated from single, isolated lymphocytes using a procedure referred to in the art as the selected lymphocyte antibody method (SLAM), as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,627,052, PCT Publication WO 92/02551 and Babcock, J.S. et al. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 93:7843-7848. In this method, single cells secreting antibodies of interest, e.g., lymphocytes derived from any one of the immunized animals described in Section 1, are screened using an antigen-specific hemolytic plaque assay, wherein the antigen PGE\n2\n, a subunit Of PGE\n2\n, or a fragment thereof, is coupled to sheep red blood cells using a linker, such as biotin, and used to identify single cells that secrete antibodies with specificity for PGE\n2\n. Following identification of antibody-secreting cells of interest, heavy- and light- chain variable region cDNAs are rescued from the cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR and these variable regions can then be expressed, in the context of appropriate immunoglobulin constant regions (e.g., human constant regions), in mammalian host cells, such as COS, HEK293, or CHO cells. The host cells transfected with the amplified immunoglobulin sequences, derived from in vivo selected lymphocytes, can then undergo further analysis and selection in vitro, for example by panning the transfected cells to isolate cells expressing antibodies to PGE\n2\n. The amplified immunoglobulin sequences further can be manipulated in vitro, such as by in vitro affinity maturation methods such as those described in PCT Publication WO 97/29131 and PCT Publication WO 00/56772.\n\n\n3. Anti-Prostaglandin E\n2\n Monoclonal Antibodies Using Transgenic Animals \n\n In another embodiment of the instant invention, antibodies are produced by immunizing a non-human animal comprising some, or all, of the human immunoglobulin locus with a PGE\n2\n-carrier protein conjugate. In a preferred embodiment, the non-human animal is a XENOMOUSE transgenic mouse, an engineered mouse strain that comprises large fragments of the human immunoglobulin loci and is deficient in mouse antibody production. See, e.g., Green et al. Nature Genetics 7: 13-21 (1994) and United States Patents 5,916,771, 5,939,598, 5,985,615, 5,998,209, 6,075,181, 6,091,001, 6,114,598 and 6,130,364. See also WO 91/10741, published July 25,1991, WO 94/02602, published February 3, 1994, WO 96/34096 and WO 96/33735, both published October 31, 1996, WO 98/16654, published April 23, 1998, WO 98/24893, published June 11, 1998, WO 98/50433, published November 12, 1998, WO 99/45031, published September 10, 1999, WO 99/53049, published October 21, 1999, WO 00 09560, published February 24, 2000 and WO 00/037504, published June 29, 2000. The XENOMOUSE transgenic mouse produces an adult-like human repertoire of fully human antibodies, and generates antigen-specific human Mabs. The XENOMOUSE transgenic mouse contains approximately 80% of the human antibody repertoire through introduction of megabase sized, germline configuration YAC fragments of the human heavy chain loci and x light chain loci.

Alternatively, the recombinant antibody library may be from a naϊve subject, i.e., one who has not been immunized with PGE\n2\n-carrier protein conjugate, such as a human antibody library from a human subject who has not been immunized with PGE\n2\n-carrier protein conjugate. Antibodies of the invention are selected by screening the recombinant antibody library with an agent comprising PGE\n2\n to thereby select those antibodies that recognize PGE\n2\n. Methods for conducting such screening and selection are well known in the art, such as described in the references in the preceding paragraph. To select antibodies of the invention having particular binding affinities for PGE\n2\n, such as those that dissociate from PGE\n2\n with a particular k\noff\n rate constant, the art- known method of surface plasmon resonance can be used to select antibodies having the desired k\noff\n rate constant. To select antibodies of the invention having a particular neutralizing activity for PGE\n2\n, such as those with a particular an IC50, standard methods known in the art for assessing the inhibition of PGE\n2\n activity may be used.\n\n\nFor example, the antibodies of the present invention can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles that carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In a particular, such phage can be utilized to display antigen-binding domains expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library (e.g., human or murine). Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M 13 binding domains expressed from phage with Fab, Fv or disulfide stabilized Fv antibody domains recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII protein. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include \n\n those disclosed in Brinkman et al., J. Immunol.

For example, techniques to recombinantly produce Fab, Fab' and F(ab')2 fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT publication WO 92/22324; Mullinax et al., BioTechniques\n\n\n12(6):864-869 (1992); and Sawai et al., AJRI 34:26-34 (1995); and Better et al., Science 240: 1041-1043 (1988). Examples of techniques that can be used to produce single-chain Fvs and antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. 4,946,778 and 5,258, 498; Huston et al., Methods in Enzymology 203:46-88 (1991); Shu et al., PNAS 90:7995-7999 (1993); and Skerra et al., Science 240: 1038-1040 (1988).\n\n\nAlternative to screening of recombinant antibody libraries by phage display, other methodologies known in the art for screening large combinatorial libraries can be applied to the identification of dual specificity antibodies of the invention. One type of alternative expression system is one in which the recombinant antibody library is expressed as RNA-protein fusions, as described in PCT Publication No. WO 98/31700 by Szostak and Roberts, and in Roberts, R. W. and Szostak, J. W. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 94: 12297-12302. In this system, a covalent fusion is created between an mRNA and the peptide or protein that it encodes by in vitro translation of synthetic mRNAs that carry puromycin, a peptidyl acceptor antibiotic, at their 3 ' end. Thus, a specific mRNA can be enriched from a complex mixture of mRNAs (e.g., a combinatorial library) based on the properties of the encoded peptide or protein, e.g., antibody, or portion thereof, such as binding of the antibody, or portion thereof, to the dual specificity antigen. Nucleic \n\n acid sequences encoding antibodies, or portions thereof, recovered from screening of such libraries can be expressed by recombinant means as described above (e.g., in mammalian host cells) and, moreover, can be subjected to further affinity maturation by either additional rounds of screening of mRNA-peptide fusions in which mutations have been introduced into the originally selected sequence(s), or by other methods for affinity maturation in vitro of recombinant antibodies, as described above.\n\n\nIn another approach the antibodies of the present invention can also be generated using yeast display methods known in the art. In yeast display methods, genetic methods are used to tether antibody domains to the yeast cell wall and display them on the surface of yeast. In particular, such yeast can be utilized to display antigen-binding domains expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library (e.g., human or murine). Examples of yeast display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Wittrup, et al. U.S. Patent No. 6,699,658.\n\n\n5. Anti-Prostaglandin E\n2\n monoclonal antibodies using PROfusion mRNA display\n\n\nPROfusion™ technology is one of the mRNA display technologies decribed above. PROfusion™ technology can be used to display human antibody fragments (VH or VL or scFv) coupled to their encoding DNA sequences for selecting against various antigens. Examples of mRNA display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Szostak, et al. U.S. Patent No. 6,207,446; 6,214,553; and Gold, et al.

Affinity maturation of anti-prostaglandin E\n2\n monoclonal antibodies\n\n\nIn vitro methods also can be used for the affinity maturation of the antibodies of the invention, wherein a mutagenesis antibody library is generated by introducing point mutation(s) in CDRs and/or frameworks of one initial antibody using error-prone PCR, or synthetic combinatorial oligo nucleotides, or oligo nucleotides directed mutagenesis. The mutagenesis library then can be screened to identify an antibody having the improved binding specificity. Methods for such screening of recombinant antibody libraries are well known in the art and include methods described in, for example, Ladner et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409; Kang et al.

Production Of Recombinant Prostaglandin E\n2\n Antibodies\n\n\nAntibodies of the present invention may be produced by any of a number of techniques known in the art. For example, expression from host cells, wherein expression vector(s) encoding the heavy and light chains are transfected into a host cell by standard techniques. The various forms of the term \"transfection\" are intended to encompass a wide variety of techniques commonly used for the introduction of exogenous DNA into a \n\n prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell, e.g., electroporation, calcium-phosphate precipitation, DEAE-dextran transfection and the like. Although it is possible to express the antibodies of the invention in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells, expression of antibodies in eukaryotic cells is preferable, and most preferable in mammalian host cells, because such eukaryotic cells (and in particular mammalian cells) are more likely than prokaryotic cells to assemble and secrete a properly folded and immunologically active antibody.\n\n\nPreferred mammalian host cells for expressing the recombinant antibodies of the invention include Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) (including dhfr- CHO cells, described in Urlaub and Chasin, (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 77:4216-4220, used with a DHFR selectable marker, e.g., as described in RJ. Kaufman and P.A. Sharp (1982) MoI. Biol. 159:601-621), NSO myeloma cells, COS cells and SP2 cells. When recombinant expression vectors encoding antibody genes are introduced into mammalian host cells, the antibodies are produced by culturing the host cells for a period of time sufficient to allow for expression of the antibody in the host cells or, more preferably, secretion of the antibody into the culture medium in which the host cells are grown.\n\n\nAntibodies can be recovered from the culture medium using standard protein purification methods.\n\n\nHost cells can also be used to produce functional antibody fragments, such as Fab fragments or scFv molecules. It will be understood that variations on the above procedure are within the scope of the present invention. For example, it may be desirable to transfect a host cell with DNA encoding functional fragments of either the light chain and/or the heavy chain of an antibody of this invention. Recombinant DNA technology may also be used to remove some, or all, of the DNA encoding either or both of the light and heavy chains that is not necessary for binding to the antigens of interest. The molecules expressed from such truncated DNA molecules are also encompassed by the antibodies of the invention. In addition, bifunctional antibodies may be produced in which one heavy and one light chain are an antibody of the invention and the other heavy and light chain are specific for an antigen other than the antigens of interest by crosslinking an antibody of the invention to a second antibody by standard chemical crosslinking methods. \n\n In a preferred system for recombinant expression of an antibody, or antigen- binding portion thereof, of the invention, a recombinant expression vector encoding both the antibody heavy chain and the antibody light chain is introduced into dhfr- CHO cells by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection. Within the recombinant expression vector, the antibody heavy and light chain genes are each operatively linked to CMV enhancer/AdMLP promoter regulatory elements to drive high levels of transcription of the genes. The recombinant expression vector also carries a DHFR gene, which allows for selection of CHO cells that have been transfected with the vector using methotrexate selection/amplification. The selected transformant host cells are cultured to allow for expression of the antibody heavy and light chains and intact antibody is recovered from the culture medium. Standard molecular biology techniques are used to prepare the recombinant expression vector, transfect the host cells, select for transformants, culture the host cells and recover the antibody from the culture medium. Still further the invention provides a method of synthesizing a recombinant antibody of the invention by culturing a host cell of the invention in a suitable culture medium until a recombinant antibody of the invention is synthesized. The method can further comprise isolating the recombinant antibody from the culture medium.\n\n\nProduction of Anti-Prostaglandin E\n2\n Chimeric Antibodies\n\n\nA chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species, such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art and discussed in detail in Example 2.1. See e.g., Morrison, Science 229: 1202 (1985); Oi et al., BioTechniques 4:214 (1986); Gillies et al., (1989) J. Immunol. Methods 125: 191-202; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397. In addition, techniques developed for the production of \"chimeric antibodies\" (Morrison et al., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81:851- 855; Neuberger et al., 1984, Nature 312:604-608; Takeda et al., 1985, Nature 314:452- 454) by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. \n\n In one embodiment, the chimeric antibodies of the invention are produced by replacing the heavy chain constant region of the murine monoclonal anti PGE\n2\n antibodies described in section 1 with a human IgGl constant region. In a specific embodiment the chimeric antibody of the invention comprises a heavy chain variable region (V\nH\n ) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, and 80 and light chain variable region (V\nL\n) SEQ ID 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, and 81.\n\n\nAnti-Prostaglandin E\n2\n Humanized Antibodies\n\n\nHumanized antibodies are antibody molecules derived from a non-human species antibody that binds the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule.

Health (1983). Such imported sequences can be used to reduce immunogenicity or reduce, enhance or modify binding, affinity, on-rate, off-rate, avidity, specificity, half-life, or any other suitable characteristic, as known in the art.\n\n\nFramework residues in the human framework regions may be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323 (1988)). Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available that illustrate and display probable three- dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. I n this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding. Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art, such as, but not limited to, those described in Jones et al., Nature 321:522 (1986); Verhoeyen et al., Science 239: 1534 (1988)), Sims et al., J.

Production of Antibodies and Antibody-Producing Cell Lines\n\n\nPreferably, anti- PGE\n2\n antibodies of the present invention exhibit a high capacity to reduce or to neutralize PGE\n2\n activity, e.g., as assessed by any one of several in vitro and in vivo assays known in the art (e.g., see Example l. l.C). For example, these antibodies neutralize PGE2-induced calcium influx in EP4 assay with IC50 values in the range of at least about 10\n\"6\n M, about 10\n\"7\n M, about 10\n\"8\n M, about 10\n\"9\n M, about 10\n\"10\n M, about 10\n\"11\n M or about 10\n\"12\n M.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, the isolated antibody, or antigen-binding portion thereof, binds PGE\n2\n, wherein the antibody, or antigen-binding portion thereof, dissociates from PGE\n2\n with a ko\nff\n rate constant of about 0. Is\n\"1\n or less, as determined by radioimmoassay or which inhibits PGE\n2\n activity with an IC50 of about 1 x 10\n\"6\nM or less.

Alternatively, the antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, may dissociate from PGE\n2\n with a k\noff\n rate constant of about 1 x 10\n\"3\nS \n1\n or less, as determined by radioimmunoassay, or may inhibit PGE\n2\n with an IC\n50\n of about 1 x 10\n\"8\nM or less. Alternatively, the antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, may dissociate from PGE\n2\n with a k\noff\n rate constant of about 1 x 10\n\"4\nS \n1\n or less, as determined by radioimmunoassay, or may inhibit PGE\n2\n activity with an IC\n50\n of about 1 x 10\n\"9\nM or less. Alternatively, the antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, may dissociate from PGE\n2\n with a k\noff\n rate constant of about 1 x 10\n\"5\nS \n1\n or less, as determined by radioimmunoassay, or may inhibit PGE\n2\n activity with an IC\n50\n of about 1 x 10\n\"10\nM or less. Alternatively, the antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, may dissociate from PGE\n2\n with a k\noff\n rate constant of about 1 x 10\n\"6\nS \n1\n or less, as determined by radioimmunoassay, or may inhibit PGE\n2\n activity with an IC\n50\n of about 1 x 10\n\"11\nM or less. \n\n The monoclonal antibodies of the invention block PGE\n2\n binding to at least one of EPl, EP2, EP3, and EP4 receptors. Both FACS-based receptor binding assay and \n3\nH- labeled PGE\n2\n binding assay on cell surface demonstratethat both murine version and humanized version anti-PGE2, are able to effectively block PGE\n2\n binding to its receptors. The crystal structure of PGE\n2\n complexed with the Fab portion of humanized anti-PGE\n2\n antibody Hu2B5.7 is envisioned by the invention\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the antibody comprises a heavy chain constant region, such as an IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, IgE, IgM or IgD constant region. Preferably, the heavy chain constant region is an IgGl heavy chain constant region or an IgG4 heavy chain constant region. Furthermore, the antibody can comprise a light chain constant region, either a kappa light chain constant region or a lambda light chain constant region. Preferably, the antibody comprises a kappa light chain constant region. Alternatively, the antibody portion can be, for example, a Fab fragment or a single chain Fv fragment.\n\n\nReplacements of amino acid residues in the Fc portion to alter antibody effector function are known in the art (Winter, et al. US PAT NOS 5,648,260; 5624821). The Fc portion of an antibody mediates several important effector functions, e.g., cytokine induction, ADCC, phagocytosis, complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and half-life/ clearance rate of antibody and antigen-antibody complexes. In some cases these effector functions are desirable for therapeutic antibody but in other cases might be unnecessary or even deleterious, depending on the therapeutic objectives. Certain human IgG isotypes, particularly IgGl and IgG3, mediate ADCC and CDC via binding to FcγRs and complement CIq, respectively. Neonatal Fc receptors (FcRn) are the critical components determining the circulating half-life of antibodies. In still another embodiment at least one amino acid residue is replaced in the constant region of the antibody, for example, the Fc region of the antibody, such that effector functions of the antibody are altered. In another embodiment, the activity of the Fc fragment can be greatly enhanced by sialylation of the N-linked glycan of the Fc portion (e.g., with 2,6-linkage to the penultimate galactose on the complex, biantennary glycan found at Asn 297 in immunoglobulin G (IgG)) (Anthony, RM (2008) Science 320:373-376).\n\n\nOne embodiment provides a labeled binding protein wherein an antibody or antibody portion of the invention is derivatized or linked to another functional molecule \n\n (e.g., another peptide or protein). For example, a labeled binding protein of the invention can be derived by functionally linking an antibody or antibody portion of the invention (e.g., by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more other molecular entities, such as another antibody (e.g., a bispecific antibody or a diabody), a detectable agent, a cytotoxic agent, a pharmaceutical agent, and/or a protein or peptide that can mediate association of the antibody or antibody portion with another molecule (e.g., such as a streptavidin core region or a polyhistidine tag).\n\n\nUseful detectable agents with which an antibody or antibody portion of the invention may be derivatized include fluorescent compounds. Exemplary fluorescent detectable agents include fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, 5- dimethylamine-1-napthalenesulfonyl chloride, phycoerythrin and the like. An antibody may also be derivatized with detectable enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase, glucose oxidase and the like. When an antibody is derivatized with a detectable enzyme, it is detected by adding additional reagents that the enzyme uses to produce a detectable reaction product. For example, when the detectable agent horseradish peroxidase is present, the addition of hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine leads to a colored reaction product, which is detectable. An antibody may also be derivatized with biotin, and detected through indirect measurement of avidin or streptavidin binding.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the invention provides a crystallized binding protein.\n\n\nPreferably the invention relates to crystals of whole anti- PGE\n2\n antibodies and fragments thereof as disclosed herein, and formulations and compositions comprising such crystals. In one embodiment the crystallized binding protein has a greater half-life in vivo than the soluble counterpart of the binding protein. In another embodiment the binding protein retains biological activity after crystallization.\n\n\nCrystallized binding protein of the invention may be produced according methods known in the art and as disclosed in WO 02072636.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the invention provides a glycosylated binding protein wherein the antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof comprises one or more carbohydrate residues. Nascent in vivo protein production may undergo further processing, known as post-translational modification. In particular, sugar (glycosyl) \n\n residues may be added enzymatically, a process known as glycosylation. The resulting proteins bearing covalently linked oligosaccharide side chains are known as glycosylated proteins or glycoproteins. Antibodies are glycoproteins with one or more carbohydrate residues in the Fc domain, as well as the variable domain. Carbohydrate residues in the Fc domain have important effect on the effector function of the Fc domain, with minimal effect on antigen binding or half-life of the antibody (R. Jefferis, Biotechnol. Prog. 21 (2005), pp. 11-16). In contrast, glycosylation of the variable domain may have an effect on the antigen binding activity of the antibody. Glycosylation in the variable domain may have a negative effect on antibody binding affinity, likely due to steric hindrance (Co, M.S., et al, MoI. Immunol. (1993) 30: 1361- 1367), or result in increased affinity for the antigen (Wallick, S.C., et al., Exp. Med. (1988) 168: 1099-1109; Wright, A., et al., EMBO J. (1991) 10:2717 2723).\n\n\nOne aspect of the present invention is directed to generating glycosylation site mutants in which the O- or N-linked glycosylation site of the binding protein has been mutated. One skilled in the art can generate such mutants using standard well-known technologies. Glycosylation site mutants that retain the biological activity, but have increased or decreased binding activity, are other objects of the present invention.\n\n\nIn still another embodiment, the glycosylation of the antibody or antigen-binding portion of the invention is modified. For example, an aglycoslated antibody can be made (i.e., the antibody lacks glycosylation). Glycosylation can be altered to, for example, increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such a glycosylation may increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in further detail in PCT Publication WO2003016466A2, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,714,350 and 6,350,861.\n\n\nAdditionally or alternatively, a modified antibody of the invention can be made that has an altered type of glycosylation, such as a hypofucosylated antibody having reduced amounts of fucosyl residues or an antibody having increased bisecting GIcNAc structures. Such altered glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the \n\n ADCC ability of antibodies. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies of the invention to thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation. See, for example, Shields, R. L. et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277:26733-26740; Umana et al. (1999) Nat. Biotech. 17: 176-1, as well as, European Patent No: EP 1,176,195; PCT Publications WO 03/035835; WO 99/54342 80.\n\n\nProtein glycosylation depends on the amino acid sequence of the protein of interest, as well as the host cell in which the protein is expressed. Different organisms may produce different glycosylation enzymes (e.g., glycosyltransferases and glycosidases), and have different substrates (nucleotide sugars) available. Due to such factors, protein glycosylation pattern, and composition of glycosyl residues, may differ depending on the host system in which the particular protein is expressed. Glycosyl residues useful in the invention may include, but are not limited to, glucose, galactose, mannose, fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. Preferably the glycosylated binding protein comprises glycosyl residues such that the glycosylation pattern is human.\n\n\nIt is known to those skilled in the art that differing protein glycosylation may result in differing protein characteristics. For instance, the efficacy of a therapeutic protein produced in a microorganism host, such as yeast, and glycosylated utilizing the yeast endogenous pathway may be reduced compared to that of the same protein expressed in a mammalian cell, such as a CHO cell line. Such glycoproteins may also be immunogenic in humans and show reduced half-life in vivo after administration. Specific receptors in humans and other animals may recognize specific glycosyl residues and promote the rapid clearance of the protein from the bloodstream. Other adverse effects may include changes in protein folding, solubility, susceptibility to proteases, trafficking, transport, compartmentalization, secretion, recognition by other proteins or factors, antigenicity, or allergenicity. Accordingly, a practitioner may prefer a therapeutic protein with a specific composition and pattern of glycosylation, for example, glycosylation composition and pattern identical, or at least similar, to that produced in human cells or in the species-specific cells of the intended subject animal. \n\n Expressing glycosylated proteins different from that of a host cell may be achieved by genetically modifying the host cell to express heterologous glycosylation enzymes. Using techniques known in the art a practitioner may generate antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof exhibiting human protein glycosylation. For example, yeast strains have been genetically modified to express non-naturally occurring glycosylation enzymes such that glycosylated proteins (i.e., glycoproteins) produced in these yeast strains exhibit protein glycosylation identical to that of animal cells, especially human cells (U.S patent applications 20040018590 and 20020137134 and PCT publication WO2005100584 A2).\n\n\nIn addition to the binding proteins, the present invention is also directed to an anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibody specific for such binding proteins of the invention. An anti-Id antibody is an antibody that recognizes unique determinants generally associated with the antigen-binding region of another antibody. The anti-Id can be prepared by immunizing an animal with the binding protein or a CDR containing region thereof. The immunized animal will recognize, and respond to the idiotypic determinants of the immunizing antibody and produce an anti-Id antibody. The anti-Id antibody may also be used as an \"immunogen\" to induce an immune response in yet another animal, producing a so-called anti-anti-Id antibody.\n\n\nFurther, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that a protein of interest may be expressed using a library of host cells genetically engineered to express various glycosylation enzymes, such that member host cells of the library produce the protein of interest with variant glycosylation patterns. A practitioner may then select and isolate the protein of interest with particular novel glycosylation patterns. Preferably, the protein having a particularly selected novel glycosylation pattern exhibits improved or altered biological properties.\n\n\nD. Uses of Anti-Prostaglandin E\n2\n Antibodies\n\n\nGiven their ability to bind to PGE\n2\n, the anti- PGE\n2\n antibodies, or portions thereof, of the invention can be used to detect PGE\n2\n (e.g., in a biological sample, such as serum or plasma), using a conventional immunoassay, such as an enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), an radioimmunoassay (RIA) or tissue immunohistochemistry. The invention provides a method for detecting PGE\n2\n in a biological sample comprising \n\n contacting a biological sample with an antibody, or antibody portion, of the invention and detecting either the antibody (or antibody portion) bound to PGE\n2\n or unbound antibody (or antibody portion), to thereby detect PGE\n2\n in the biological sample. The antibody is directly or indirectly labeled with a detectable substance to facilitate detection of the bound or unbound antibody. Suitable detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials and radioactive materials. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, β- galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; and examples of suitable radioactive material include \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n35\nS, \n9\nV, \n99\nTc, \n111\nIn, \n125\nI, \n131\nI, \n177\nLu, \n166\nHo, or \n153\nSm.\n\n\nAlternative to labeling the antibody, PGE\n2\n can be assayed in biological fluids by a competition immunoassay utilizing PGE\n2\n standards labeled with a detectable substance and an unlabeled anti- PGE\n2\n antibody. In this assay, the biological sample, the labeled PGE\n2\n standards and the anti- PGE\n2\n antibody are combined and the amount of labeled PGE\n2\n standard bound to the unlabeled antibody is determined. The amount of PGE\n2\n in the biological sample is inversely proportional to the amount of labeled PGE\n2\n standard bound to the anti- PGE\n2\n antibody. Similarly, PGE\n2\n can also be assayed in biological fluids by a competition immunoassay utilizing PGE\n2\n standards labeled with a detectable substance and an unlabeled anti-PGE\n2\n antibody.\n\n\nThe antibodies and antibody portions of the invention preferably are capable of neutralizing PGE\n2\n activity both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, such antibodies and antibody portions of the invention can be used to inhibit PGE\n2\n activity, e.g., in a cell culture containing PGE\n2\n, in human subjects or in other mammalian subjects having PGE\n2\n with which an antibody of the invention cross-reacts. In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for inhibiting PGE\n2\n activity comprising contacting PGE\n2\n with an antibody or antibody portion of the invention such that PGE\n2\n activity is inhibited. For example, in a cell culture containing, or suspected of containing PGE\n2\n, an antibody or antibody portion of the invention can be added to the culture medium to inhibit PGE\n2\n activity in the culture. \n\n In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for reducing PGE\n2\n activity in a subject, advantageously from a subject suffering from a disease or disorder in which PGE\n2\n activity is detrimental. The invention provides methods for reducing PGE\n2\n activity in a subject suffering from such a disease or disorder, which method comprises administering to the subject an antibody or antibody portion of the invention such that PGE\n2\n activity in the subject is reduced. Preferably, the subject is a human subject. Alternatively, the subject can be a mammal expressing PGE\n2\n to which an antibody of the invention is capable of binding. Still further the subject can be a mammal into which PGE\n2\n has been introduced (e.g., by administration of PGE\n2\n or by expression of a PGE\n2\n synthetase transgene). An antibody of the invention can be administered to a human subject for therapeutic purposes. Moreover, an antibody of the invention can be administered to a non-human mammal expressing PGE\n2\n with which the antibody is capable of binding for veterinary purposes or as an animal model of human disease. Regarding the latter, such animal models may be useful for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies of the invention (e.g., testing of dosages and time courses of administration).\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"a disorder in which PGE\n2\n activity is detrimental\" is intended to include diseases and other disorders in which the presence of PGE\n2\n in a subject suffering from the disorder has been shown to be or is suspected of being either responsible for the pathophysiology of the disorder or a factor that contributes to a worsening of the disorder. Accordingly, a disorder in which PGE\n2\n activity is detrimental is a disorder in which reduction of PGE\n2\n activity is expected to alleviate the symptoms and/or progression of the disorder. Such disorders may be evidenced, for example, by an increase in the concentration of PGE\n2\n in a biological fluid of a subject suffering from the disorder (e.g., an increase in the concentration of PGE\n2\n in serum, plasma, synovial fluid, etc. of the subject), which can be detected, for example, using an anti- PGE\n2\n antibody as described above. Non-limiting examples of disorders that can be treated with the antibodies of the invention include those disorders discussed in the section below pertaining to pharmaceutical compositions of the antibodies of the invention.\n\n\nPGE\n2\n has been implicated as having a pivotal role in causing pathological responses associated with rheumatoid arthritis. However other mediators of differential immunological pathways are also involved in arthritis, and blocking these mediators, in \n\n addition to PGE2, may offer additional therapeutic benefit. Thus, binding proteins of the invention may be incorporated into DVD-Ig™ proteins where in the DVD-Ig™ is capable of binding target pairs including, but not limited to, PGE\n2\n and a pro-inflammatory cytokine, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Blocking both PGE\n2\n and TNF-α may have beneficial effects that combining DMARD effect of TNF-α and pain relief from blocking PGE\n2\n. In a preferred embodiment, the DVD-Ig™ of the invention binds the targets PGE\n2\n and TNFα and is used for treating rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nOne aspect of the invention pertains to a DVD-Ig™ binding protein comprising binding proteins capable of binding PGE\n2\n. Preferably the DVD-Ig™ binding protein is capable of binding PGE\n2\n and a second target. The second target is selected from the group consisting of TNF, EGF, EGFR, IGFl, IGF2, IGF 1/2, IGFR Erb2, Erb3, VEGF, VEGFR, Muc-1, CSFl (MCSF), CSF2 (GM-CSF), CSF3 (GCSF), FGF2, IFNγl, IFNγl, IFNγ, histamine and histamine receptors, IL- lα, IL- lβ, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-I l, IL-12 α, IL-12 β,, IL-14, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17, IL- 18, IL-19, KITLG, PDGFB, IL-2R α, IL-4R, IL-5R α, IL-8R α, IL-8R β,, IL-12R β,l,\n\n\nIL-12R β,2, IL-18R1, TSLP, CCLl, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, CCL13, CCL 17, CCL 18, CCL 19, CCL20, CCL22, CCL24, CX3CL1, CXCLl, CXCL2, CXCL3, XCLl, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CX3CR1, GPR2, XCRl, FOS, GATA3, JAKl, JAK3, STAT6, TBX21, TGFBl, TNFSF6, YYl, CYSLTRl, FCERlA, FCER2, LTB4R, TB4R2, LTBR, and Chitinase. More preferably, the DVD binding protein is capable of recognizing PGE\n2\n and TNF α, PGE\n2\n and IL-6, PGE\n2\n and IL- lβ, PGE\n2\n and IL-6R, PGE\n2\n and CTLA-4, PGE\n2\n and EGF; PGE\n2\n and IGF- 1/2, PGE\n2\n and Erb2, PGE\n2\n and Erb3, PGE\n2\n and VEGF. Most preferably, the DVD binding protein is capable of binding PGE\n2\n and TNF α. Preferred DVD-Igs for treating autoimmune diseases include but are not limited to a DVD-Ig containing an anti PGE\n2\n antibody and a target selected from the group consisting of TNF α, IL-I α, IL- lβ, IL-6 or IL-6R, CTLA-4Ig, BAFF, TACI, RANKL, or DKKl or SOCT, MMP 13, or MMPl or MMP4. Target pairs preferably for cancer therapy include PGE\n2\n + EGF or EGFR, PGE\n2\n + IGFl or IGFlR, PGE\n2\n + IGF2 or IGF2R, PGE\n2\n + IGF 1/2, PGE\n2\n + VEGF or VEGFR, PGE\n2\n + Erb2, PGE\n2\n + Erb3, and PGE\n2\n + SlP.\n\n\nPGE\n2\n has been implicated as having a pivotal role in causing pathological responses associated with rheumatoid arthritis or cancer. However other mediators of \n\n differential immunological pathways are also involved in arthritis or cancer, and blocking these mediators, in addition to PGE\n2\n, may offer additional therapeutic benefit. A list of the drugs that currently are used for the treatment of various human diseases and disorders is available on the internet at www.drugs.com. This list is updated frequently to reflect state-of-art for the treatment of various human diseases. Anti-PGE\n2\n can be combined with any of the therapies in that list for a particular disease conditions. A few examples are provided below. AnU-PGE\n2\n can be combined with one or more agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Examples of these agents include but are not limited to the agents listed below, for example, drugs that decrease pain and inflammation while decreasing the growth of abnormal synovial tissue (the tissue that lines the inside of the joint). These drugs include methotrexate and low doses of corticosteroids (such as prednisone or cortisone). In some people, these drugs also decrease joint destruction. Other medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis include: anti-malarial medications (such as hydroxychloroquine), gold, sulfasalazine, penicillamine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin and minocycline. In addition, more than one drug may be prescribed. Newer biologic agents that block the effects of specific inflammatory factors (cytokines) are now available. Infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab block the cytokine TNFα, abatacept blocks T cell costimulation, rituximab delpetes B cells, anakinra blocks the cytokine interleukin-1, and other new biologic agents target IL-6, IL-6R, IL- 17, IL- 18, IL-23, B7.1/B7.2.

Pharmaceutical Composition\n\n\nThe invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an antibody, or antigen-binding portion thereof, of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions comprising antibodies of the invention are for use in, but not limited to, diagnosing, detecting, or monitoring a disorder, in preventing, treating, managing, or ameliorating a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof, and/or in research. In a specific embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises one or more antibodies of the invention. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises one or more antibodies of the invention and one or more prophylactic or therapeutic agents other than antibodies of the invention for treating a disorder in which PGE\n2\n activity is detrimental. Preferably, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents known to be useful for or that have been or are currently being used in the prevention, treatment, management, or amelioration of a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof. In accordance with these embodiments, the composition may further comprise of a carrier, diluent or excipient.\n\n\nThe antibodies and antibody portions of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to a subject. Typically, the pharmaceutical composition comprises an antibody or antibody portion of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include one or more of water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like, as well as combinations thereof. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may further comprise minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives or buffers, which enhance the shelf life or effectiveness of the antibody or antibody portion.\n\n\nVarious delivery systems are known and can be used to administer one or more antibodies of the invention or the combination of one or more antibodies of the invention \n\n and a prophylactic agent or therapeutic agent useful for preventing, managing, treating, or ameliorating a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the antibody or antibody fragment, receptor- mediated endocytosis (see, e. g., Wu and Wu, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432 (1987)), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector, etc. Methods of administering a prophylactic or therapeutic agent of the invention include, but are not limited to, parenteral administration (e.g., intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous and subcutaneous), epidural administration, intratumoral administration, and mucosal administration (e.g., intranasal and oral routes). In addition, pulmonary administration can be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,019,968; 5,985,320; 5,985,309; 5,934,272; 5,874,064; 5,855,913; 5,290,540; and 4,880,078; and PCT Publication Nos. WO 92/19244; WO 97/32572; WO 97/44013; WO 98/31346; and WO 99/66903. In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention, combination therapy, or a composition of the invention is administered using Alkermes AIR® pulmonary drug delivery technology (Alkermes, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.). In a specific embodiment, prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the invention are administered intramuscularly, intravenously, intratumorally, orally, intranasally, pulmonary, or subcutaneously. The prophylactic or therapeutic agents may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local.\n\n\nIn a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment. This may be achieved by, for example, local infusion, by injection, or by means of an implant, such an implant being of a porous or non-porous material, including membranes and matrices, such as sialastic membranes, polymers, fibrous matrices (e.g., Tissuel®), or collagen matrices. In one embodiment, an effective amount of one or more antibodies of the invention is administered locally to the affected area to a subject to prevent, treat, manage, and/or ameliorate a disorder or a symptom thereof. In another embodiment, an effective amount of one or more antibodies of the invention is administered locally to the affected area in combination with an effective amount of one or more therapies (e.g., one or more \n\n prophylactic or therapeutic agents) other than an antibody of the invention of a subject to prevent, treat, manage, and/or ameliorate a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the prophylactic or therapeutic agent of the invention can be delivered in a controlled release or sustained release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used to achieve controlled or sustained release (see Langer, supra; Sefton, 1987, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:20; Buchwald et al., 1980, Surgery 88:507; Saudek et al., 1989, N. Engl. J. Med. 321 :574). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used to achieve controlled or sustained release of the therapies of the invention (see e.g., Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, FIa. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product\n\n\nDesign and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, 1983, J., Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61; see also Levy et al., 1985, Science 228: 190; During et al., 1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351; Howard et al., 1989, J. Neurosurg. 7 1 : 105); U.S. Pat. No. 5,679,377; U.S. Pat. No. 5, 916,597; U. S. Pat. No. 5,912,015; U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,463; U.S. Pat. No. 5,128,326; PCT Publication No. WO 99/15154; and PCT Publication No. WO 99/20253. Examples of polymers used in sustained release formulations include, but are not limited to, poly(2 -hydroxy ethyl methacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic acid), poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), poly(methacrylic acid), polyglycolides (PLG), poly anhydrides, poly(N- vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyacrylamide, poly(ethylene glycol), polylactides (PLA), poly(lactide-co-glycolides) (PLGA), and polyorthoesters. In a preferred embodiment, the polymer used in a sustained release formulation is inert, free of leachable impurities, stable on storage, sterile, and biodegradable. In yet another embodiment, a controlled or sustained release system can be placed in proximity of the prophylactic or therapeutic target, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)).\n\n\nControlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (1990, Science 249: 1527-1533). Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more therapeutic agents of the invention. See, e.g., U. S. Pat. No. 4,526, 938, PCT publication WO 91/05548, PCT publication WO 96/20698, Ning et al. , 1996, \"Intratumoral Radioimmunotheraphy of a Human Colon Cancer Xenograft Using a Sustained-Release Gel,\" Radiotherapy &Oncology 39: 179-189, \n\n Song et al., 1995, \"Antibody Mediated Lung Targeting of Long- Circulating Emulsions,\" PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science &Technology 50:372-397, Cleek et al., 1997, \"Biodegradable Polymeric Carriers for a bFGF Antibody for Cardiovascular Application,\" Pro.

Bioact. Mater. 24:759- 760.\n\n\nIn a specific embodiment, where the composition of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding a prophylactic or therapeutic agent, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded prophylactic or therapeutic agent, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (see U. S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (see, e.g., Joliot et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 1864-1868).\n\n\nAlternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination.\n\n\nA pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include, but are not limited to, parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral, intranasal (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (e.g., topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. In a specific embodiment, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, oral, intranasal, or topical administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection.\n\n\nIf the compositions of the invention are to be administered topically, the compositions can be formulated in the form of an ointment, cream, transdermal patch, lotion, gel, shampoo, spray, aerosol, solution, emulsion, or other form known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, 19th ed., Mack Pub. Co., Easton, Pa. (1995). For non- \n\n sprayable topical dosage forms, viscous to semi-solid or solid forms comprising a carrier or one or more excipients compatible with topical application and having a dynamic viscosity preferably greater than water are typically employed. Suitable formulations include, without limitation, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, creams, ointments, powders, liniments, salves, and the like, which are, if desired, sterilized or mixed with auxiliary agents (e.g., preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, buffers, or salts) for influencing various properties, such as, for example, osmotic pressure. Other suitable topical dosage forms include sprayable aerosol preparations wherein the active ingredient, preferably in combination with a solid or liquid inert carrier, is packaged in a mixture with a pressurized volatile (e.g., a gaseous propellant, such as freon) or in a squeeze bottle.\n\n\nMoisturizers or humectants can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms if desired. Examples of such additional ingredients are well known in the art.\n\n\nIf the method of the invention comprises intranasal administration of a composition, the composition can be formulated in an aerosol form, spray, mist or in the form of drops. In particular, prophylactic or therapeutic agents for use according to the present invention can be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant (e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas). In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges (composed of, e.g., gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.\n\n\nIf the method of the invention comprises oral administration, compositions can be formulated in the form of tablets, capsules, cachets, gelcaps, solutions, suspensions, and the like. Tablets or capsules can be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well- known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, but \n\n not limited to, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives, or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol, or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl-p- hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations may also contain buffer salts, flavoring, coloring, and sweetening agents as appropriate. Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated for slow release, controlled release, or sustained release of a prophylactic or therapeutic agent(s).\n\n\nThe method of the invention may comprise pulmonary administration, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, of a composition formulated with an aerosolizing agent. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,019,968; 5,985,320; 5,985,309; 5,934,272; 5,874,064; 5,855,913; 5,290,540; and 4,880,078; and PCT Publication Nos. WO 92/19244; WO 97/32572; WO 97/44013; WO 98/31346; and WO 99/66903. In a specific embodiment, an antibody of the invention, combination therapy, and/or composition of the invention is administered using Alkermes AIR® pulmonary drug delivery technology (Alkermes, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.).\n\n\nThe method of the invention may comprise administration of a composition formulated for parenteral administration by injection (e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion). Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form (e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers) with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle (e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water) before use.\n\n\nThe methods of the invention may additionally comprise administration of compositions formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (e.g., subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compositions may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (e.g., as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives (e.g., as a sparingly soluble salt). \n\n The methods of the invention encompass administration of compositions formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2- ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.\n\n\nGenerally, the ingredients of compositions are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the mode of administration is infusion, composition can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the mode of administration is by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.\n\n\nIn particular, the invention also provides that one or more of the prophylactic or therapeutic agents, or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is packaged in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of the agent. In one embodiment, one or more of the prophylactic or therapeutic agents, or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is supplied as a dry sterilized lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container and can be reconstituted (e.g., with water or saline) to the appropriate concentration for administration to a subject. Preferably, one or more of the prophylactic or therapeutic agents or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is supplied as a dry sterile lyophilized powder in a hermetically sealed container at a unit dosage of at least 5 mg, more preferably at least 10 mg, at least 15 mg, at least 25 mg, at least 35 mg, at least 45 mg, at least 50 mg, at least 75 mg, or at least 100 mg. The lyophilized prophylactic or therapeutic agents or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention should be stored at between 2° C and 8° C in its original container and the prophylactic or therapeutic agents, or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention should be administered within 1 week, preferably within 5 days, within 72 hours, within 48 hours, within 24 hours, within 12 hours, within 6 hours, within 5 hours, within 3 hours, or within 1 hour after being reconstituted. In an alternative embodiment, one or more of the prophylactic or \n\n therapeutic agents or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is supplied in liquid form in a hermetically sealed container indicating the quantity and concentration of the agent. Preferably, the liquid form of the administered composition is supplied in a hermetically sealed container at least 0.25 mg/ml, more preferably at least 0.5 mg/ml, at least 1 mg/ml, at least 2.5 mg/ml, at least 5 mg/ml, at least 8 mg/ml, at least 10 mg/ml, at least 15 mg/kg, at least 25 mg/ml, at least 50 mg/ml, at least 75 mg/ml or at least 100 mg/ml. The liquid form should be stored at between 2° C and 8° C in its original container.\n\n\nThe antibodies and antibody -portions of the invention can be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition suitable for parenteral administration. Preferably, the antibody or antibody-portions will be prepared as an injectable solution containing 0.1- 250 mg/ml antibody. The injectable solution can be composed of either a liquid or lyophilized dosage form in a flint or amber vial, ampule or pre-filled syringe. The buffer can be L-histidine (1-50 mM), optimally 5-1OmM, at pH 5.0 to 7.0 (optimally pH 6.0). Other suitable buffers include but are not limited to, sodium succinate, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate or potassium phosphate. Sodium chloride can be used to modify the toxicity of the solution at a concentration of 0-300 mM (optimally 150 mM for a liquid dosage form). Cryoprotectants can be included for a lyophilized dosage form, principally 0-10% sucrose (optimally 0.5-1.0%). Other suitable cryoprotectants include trehalose and lactose. Bulking agents can be included for a lyophilized dosage form, principally 1 - 10% mannitol (optimally 2-4%). Stabilizers can be used in both liquid and lyophilized dosage forms, principally 1-50 mM L-Methionine (optimally 5-10 mM). Other suitable bulking agents include glycine, arginine, can be included as 0-0.05% polysorbate-80 (optimally 0.005-0.01%). Additional surfactants include but are not limited to polysorbate 20 and BRIJ surfactants. The pharmaceutical composition comprising the antibodies and antibody -portions of the invention prepared as an injectable solution for parenteral administration, can further comprise an agent useful as an adjuvant, such as those used to increase the absorption, or dispersion of a therapeutic protein (e.g., antibody). A particularly useful adjuvant is hyaluronidase, such as Hylenex® (recombinant human hyaluronidase). Addition of hyaluronidase in the injectable solution improves human bioavailability following parenteral administration, particularly subcutaneous administration. It also allows for greater injection site volumes (i.e., greater \n\n than 1 ml) with less pain and discomfort, and minimum incidence of injection site reactions (see WO2004078140 and US2006104968).\n\n\nThe compositions of this invention may be in a variety of forms. These include, for example, liquid, semi-solid and solid dosage forms, such as liquid solutions (e.g., injectable and infusible solutions), dispersions or suspensions, tablets, pills, powders, liposomes and suppositories. The preferred form depends on the intended mode of administration and therapeutic application. Typical preferred compositions are in the form of injectable or infusible solutions, such as compositions similar to those used for passive immunization of humans with other antibodies. The preferred mode of administration is parenteral (e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular). In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is administered by intravenous infusion or injection. In another preferred embodiment, the antibody is administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.\n\n\nTherapeutic compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, dispersion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (i.e., antibody or antibody portion) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile, lyophilized powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and spray-drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The proper fluidity of a solution can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prolonged absorption of injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin. \n\n The antibodies and antibody -portions of the present invention can be administered by a variety of methods known in the art, although for many therapeutic applications, the preferred route/mode of administration is subcutaneous injection, intravenous injection or infusion. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results. In certain embodiments, the active compound may be prepared with a carrier that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or generally known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, J.R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, an antibody or antibody portion of the invention may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. The compound (and other ingredients, if desired) may also be enclosed in a hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, compressed into tablets, or incorporated directly into the subject's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the compounds may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. To administer a compound of the invention by other than parenteral administration, it may be necessary to coat the compound with, or co-administer the compound with, a material to prevent its inactivation.\n\n\nSupplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. In certain embodiments, an antibody or antibody portion of the invention is coformulated with and/or coadministered with one or more additional therapeutic agents that are useful for treating disorders in which PGE\n2\n activity is detrimental. For example, an anti-PGE\n2\n antibody or antibody portion of the invention may be coformulated and/or coadministered with one or more additional antibodies that bind other targets (e.g., antibodies that bind other cytokines or that bind cell surface molecules). Furthermore, one or more antibodies of the invention may be used in combination with two or more of the foregoing therapeutic agents. Such combination therapies may advantageously utilize lower \n\n dosages of the administered therapeutic agents, thus avoiding possible toxicities or complications associated with the various monotherapies.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, an antibody to PGE\n2\n or fragment thereof is linked to a half-life extending vehicle known in the art. Such vehicles include, but are not limited to, the Fc domain, polyethylene glycol, and dextran. Such vehicles are described, e.g., in U.S. Application Serial No. 09/428,082 and published PCT Application No. WO 99/25044.\n\n\nIn a specific embodiment, nucleic acid sequences comprising nucleotide sequences encoding an antibody of the invention or another prophylactic or therapeutic agent of the invention are administered to treat, prevent, manage, or ameliorate a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof by way of gene therapy. Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acids produce their encoded antibody or prophylactic or therapeutic agent of the invention that mediates a prophylactic or therapeutic effect.\n\n\nAny of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention. For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy, see Goldspiel et al, 1993, Clinical Pharmacy 12:488-505; Wu and Wu, 1991, Biotherapy 3:87-95; Tolstoshev, 1993, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573-596; Mulligan, Science 260:926- 932 (1993); and Morgan and Anderson, 1993, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62: 191-217; May, 1993, TIBTECH 11(5): 155-215. Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &Sons, NY (1993); and Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, NY (1990). Detailed descriptions of various methods of gene therapy are disclosed in US20050042664 A1.\n\n\nIn another aspect, this application features a method of treating (e.g., curing, suppressing, ameliorating, delaying or preventing the onset of, or preventing recurrence or relapse of) or preventing a PGE\n2\n-associated disorder, in a subject. The method includes: administering to the subject a PGE\n2\n binding agent (particularly an antagonist), e.g., an anti- PGE\n2\n antibody or fragment thereof as described herein, in an amount \n\n sufficient to treat or prevent the PGE\n2\n-associated disorder. The PGE\n2\n antagonist, e.g., the anti- PGE\n2\n antibody or fragment thereof, can be administered to the subject, alone or in combination with other therapeutic modalities as described herein.\n\n\nThe invention provides methods for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and disorders of immunity in a subject, which disorders are characterised by excessive PGE\n2\nbiosynthesis, which methods comprise administering to the subject an effective amount of a antibody specific to PGE\n2\n. Disorders that may be treated by the method according to the invention include autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and tumors in which excessive PGE\n2\n synthesis has been implicated. Such disorders include: (a) rheumatoid and allergic arthritis; (b) certain illnesses induced by viruses, such as Guillain Barre syndrome, infectious mononucleosis, other viral lymphadenopathies and infections with herpes virus; (c) multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases; (d) hematological disorders, such as hemolytic anemias and thrombocytopenias; (e) endocrinologic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus, Addison's disease, idiopathic hypoparathyroidism and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis; (f) collagen disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus; and (g) disorders of reproduction such as amenorrhoea, infertility, recurrent abortions and eclampsia; and (h) tumors such as headneck tumor, lung cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc., and (i) inflammatory and/or autoimmune conditions of the skin, gastrointestinal organs (e.g., inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis and/or Crohn's disease); and (j) pain related with osteoarthritis and other disorders; and (k) ocular disorders such as age- related mascular degeneration (AMD). Accordingly, the disclosure includes the use of a PGE\n2\n binding agent (such as an anti- PGE\n2\n antibody or fragment thereof described herein) for a treatment described herein and the use of a PGE\n2\n binding agent (such as an anti- PGE\n2\n antibody or fragment thereof described herein) for preparing a medicament for a treatment described herein.\n\n\nExamples of PGE\n2\n-associated

provides a method for detecting the presence of PGE\n2\n in a sample in vitro (e.g., a biological sample, such as serum, plasma, tissue, biopsy). The subject method can be used to diagnose a disorder, e.g., an immune cell- associated disorder. The method includes: (i) contacting the sample or a control sample with the anti- PGE\n2\n antibody or fragment thereof as described herein; and (ii) detecting \n\n formation of a complex between the anti- PGE2 antibody or fragment thereof, and the sample or the control sample, wherein a statistically significant change in the formation of the complex in the sample relative to the control sample is indicative of the presence of the PGE2 in the sample.\n\n\nIn yet another aspect, this application provides a method for detecting the presence of PGE\n2\n in vivo (e.g., in vivo imaging in a subject). The subject method can be used to diagnose a disorder, e.g., a PGE\n2\n- associated disorder. The method includes: (i) administering the anti- PGE\n2\n antibody or fragment thereof as described herein to a subject or a control subject under conditions that allow binding of the antibody or fragment to PGE\n2\n; and (ii) detecting formation of a complex between the antibody or fragment and PGE\n2\n, wherein a statistically significant change in the formation of the complex in the subject relative to the control subject is indicative of the presence Of PGE\n2\n.\n\n\nAntibodies of the invention, or antigen binding portions thereof, can be used alone or in combination to treat such diseases. It should be understood that the antibodies of the invention or antigen binding portion thereof can be used alone or in combination with an additional agent, e.g., a therapeutic agent, the additional agent being selected by the skilled artisan for its intended purpose. For example, the additional agent can be a therapeutic agent art-recognized as being useful to treat the disease or condition being treated by the antibody of the present invention. The additional agent also can be an agent that imparts a beneficial attribute to the therapeutic composition, e.g., an agent that affects the viscosity of the composition.\n\n\nIt should further be understood that the combinations that are to be included within this invention are those combinations useful for their intended purpose. The agents set forth below are illustrative for purposes and not intended to be limited. The combinations, which are part of this invention, can be the antibodies of the present invention and at least one additional agent selected from the lists below. The combination can also include more than one additional agent, e.g., two or three additional agents if the combination is such that the formed composition can perform its intended function.\n\n\nThe combination therapy can include one or more PGE\n2\n antagonists, e.g., anti-\n\n\nPGE\n2\n antibodies or fragments thereof, coformulated with, and/or coadministered with, \n\n one or more additional therapeutic agents, e.g., one or more cytokine and growth factor inhibitors, immunosuppressants, anti- inflammatory agents (e.g., systemic antiinflammatory agents), anti-fibrotic agents, metabolic inhibitors, enzyme inhibitors, and/or cytotoxic or cytostatic agents, as described in more herein. Examples of preferred additional therapeutic agents that can be coadministered and/or coformulated with one or more PGE\n2\n antagonists, e.g., anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies or fragments thereof, include, but are not limited to, one or more of: inhaled steroids; beta-agonists, e.g., short-acting or long- acting beta-agonists; antagonists of leukotrienes or leukotriene receptors; combination drugs such as ADVAIR; IgE inhibitors, e.g., anti-IgE antibodies (e.g., XOLAIR); phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., PDE4 inhibitors); xanthines; anticholinergic drugs; mast cell-stabilizing agents such as cromolyn; IL-4 inhibitors; IL-5 inhibitors; eotaxin/CCR3 inhibitors; antagonists of histamine or its receptors including Hl, H2, H3, and H4, and antagonists of prostaglandin D or its receptors (DPI and CRTH2) . Such combinations can be used to treat asthma and other respiratory disorders. Additional examples of therapeutic agents that can be coadministered and/or coformulated with one or more anti-PGE2 antibodies or fragments thereof include one or more of: TNF antagonists (e.g., a soluble fragment of a TNF receptor, e.g., p55 or p75 human TNF receptor or derivatives thereof, e.g., 75 kD TNFR-IgG (75 kD TNF receptor-IgG fusion protein, ENBREL)); TNF enzyme antagonists, e.g., TNF converting enzyme (TACE) inhibitors; muscarinic receptor antagonists; TGF-beta antagonists; interferon gamma; perfenidone; chemotherapeutic agents, e.g., methotrexate, leflunomide, or a sirolimus (raparnycin) or an analog thereof, e.g., CCI-779; COX2 and cPLA2 inhibitors; NSAIDs; immunomodulators; p38 inhibitors, TPL-2, MK-2 and NFkB inhibitors, among others. Other combinations are cytokine suppressive anti-inflammatory drug(s) (CSAIDs); antibodies to or antagonists of other human cytokines or growth factors, for example, IL- 1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-15, IL-16, IL-18, IL-21, IL-31, interferons, EMAP-II, GM-CSF, FGF, EGF, PDGF, and edothelin-1, as well as the receptors of these cytokines and growth factors. Antibodies of the invention, or antigen binding portions thereof, can be combined with antibodies to cell surface molecules such as CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD28, CD30, CD40, CD45, CD69, CD80 (B7.1), CD86 (B7.2), CD90, CTLA or their ligands including CD154 (gp39 or CD40L). \n\n Preferred combinations of therapeutic agents may interfere at different points in the inflammatory cascade. Preferred examples include TNF antagonists like chimeric, humanized or human TNF antibodies, D2E7, (PCT Publication No. WO 97/29131), CA2 (RemicadeTM), CDP 571, and soluble p55 or p75 TNF receptors, derivatives, thereof, (p75TNFRl gG (EnbrelTM) or p55TNFRl gG (Lenercept), and also TNF converting enzyme (TACE) inhibitors; similarly IL-I inhibitors (Interleukin- 1 -converting enzyme inhibitors, IL-IRA etc.) may be effective for the same reason.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may include a \"therapeutically effective amount\" or a \"prophylactically effective amount\" of an antibody or antibody portion of the invention. A \"therapeutically effective amount\" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result. A therapeutically effective amount of the antibody or antibody portion may be determined by a person skilled in the art and may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the antibody or antibody portion to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody, or antibody portion, are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A \"prophylactically effective amount\" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically, since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.\n\n\nDosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active \n\n compound and the particular therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.\n\n\nAn exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of an antibody or antibody portion of the invention is 0.1 -20 mg/kg, more preferably 1-10 mg/kg. It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the type and severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition.\n\n\nIt will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that other suitable modifications and adaptations of the methods of the invention described herein are obvious and may be made using suitable equivalents without departing from the scope of the invention or the embodiments disclosed herein. Having now described the present invention in detail, the same will be more clearly understood by reference to the following examples, which are included for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting of the invention.\n\n\nExemplification\n\n\nExample 1: Generation And Isolation Of Anti Prostaglandin E2 Monoclonal\n\n\nAntibodies\n\n\nExample 1.1: Assays To Identify Anti Human Prostaglandin E2 Antibodies\n\n\nThe following assays were used to identify and characterize anti-prostaglandin E\n2\n antibodies unless otherwise stated.\n\n\nExample 1.1.A: ELISA\n\n\nEnzyme linked immunosorbent assays to screen for antibodies that bind prostaglandin E2 were performed according to at least one of the two following methods. \n\n Method 1\n\n\nELISA plates (Costar 3369, Corning, NY) were coated with 50 μl of anti-host Fc IgG (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 2 μg/ml in PBS (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA). Following an overnight incubation at 4°C, washed with PBS and the plate was blocked with 200 μl Superblock (Pierce #37535, Rockford, IL). The IgG containing samples were diluted to 1 μg/ml in Assay Buffer (10% Superblock in PBS containing 0.05% Surfactamps (Pierce #37535, Rockford, IL) and 50 μl/well added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed four times with Tween-Tris Buffered Solution (TTBS). PGE2-biotinamide (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) was diluted to 30 nM and serially diluted 1 :3 in Assay Buffer. The titration curve samples were added to each IgG sample at 50 μl/well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed as previously described and 50 μl of 1 :5000 dilution of streptavidin polyhrp40 (Fitzgerald Industries, Concord, MA) in Assay Buffer was added to each well and incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature. A final wash step was performed and the plates were developed using a single step TMB system (Sigma #T8665, St. Louis, MO) and 100 μl /well 2N H\n2\nSO\n4\n. Plates were read at 450 nm on a Molecular Devices Spectramax plate reader (Sunnyvale, CA). EC\n50\n was determined using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).\n\n\nMethod 2 Alternatively, prostaglandin binding was determined using a \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n ELISA.\n\n\nPlates were coated at 50 μL/well with 5 μg/ml of goat anti-human IgG (Fc) (Thermo Scientific # 31 170, Hudson, NH) or goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc) (Thermo Scientific # 31 125, Hudson, NH) in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 C. The following day, plates were flicked and blotted dry. Plates were blocked with 200 μL/well of Superblock (Thermo Scientific # 37515, Hudson, NH) for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were flicked and blotted dry. Monoclonal antibodies were diluted to 0.04 μg/ml in phosphate buffer solution with Tween 20 (PBST) (Abbott Bioresearch Center, Worcester, MA) and 10% Superblock and 50 μL of each antibody was added to each well of the pre-blocked ELISA plate at 2ng/well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Wells were washed 3 times with PBS + 0.1% Tween-20. A serial 3-fold titration of \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n (Perkin Elmer # NET-428, Waltham, MA) was prepared in PBST/ 10% Superblock. Fifty microliters of the \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n solution was added to each well of the plate and incubated for \n\n 1 hour at room temperature. Wells were washed manually 6 times with PBST/ 10% Superblock and 50 μL of scintillation fluid (Perkin Elmer # 6013621, Waltham, MA) was added to each well. Plates were read using a TopCount reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) with a 5 minute count delay. An EC50 number was determined using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).\n\n\nExample l.l.B: PGE\n1\n Competition ELISA\n\n\nCompetition enzyme linked immunosorbent assays were performed to determine prostaglandin binding specificity for antibodies that bind prostaglandin E\n2\n, according to at least one of the two following methods.\n\n\nMethod 1\n\n\nELISA plates (Costar 3369, Corning, NY) were coated with 50 μl/well of anti- host Fc IgG (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 2 μg/ml in PBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Following an overnight incubation at 4°C, the plate was blocked with 200 μl Superblock (Pierce #37535, Rockford, IL). The IgG samples were diluted to 6 μg/ml in Assay Buffer (10% Superblock in PBS containing 0.05% Surfactamps (Pierce #37535, Rockford, IL). The PGE\n2\n-biotinamide was diluted to 3 nM in Assay Buffer. A titration curve in Assay Buffer was prepared for the prostaglandins PGA\n2\n (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI), PGD\n2\n (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) and PGE\n2\n (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) starting at 300 nM by a 1: 10 serial dilution. The reagents were added to tubes at a volume of 50 μl each/tube and preincubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Following the preincubation, the mix was transferred to the blocked plates and allowed to incubate for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, the plates were washed four times with Tween 20- Tris buffered solution (TTBS). Streptavidin polyhrp40 in Assay Buffer (Fitzgerald Industries, Concord, MA) at a 1:5000 dilution was then added to the wells and incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature. A final wash step was performed and the plates were developed using a single step TMB system (Sigma #T8665, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 100 μl /well 2N H\n2\nSO\n4\n. Plates were read at 450 nm on a Molecular Devices Spectramax plate reader (Sunnyvale, CA). Wells in which unlabeled prostaglandins competed with the PGE\n2\n-biotinamide for binding resulted in a decrease of signal. IC50 number was determined using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The cross reactivity index was then calculated by IC50 of PGE\n2\n/IC50 of other prostaglandin(s). \n\n Method 2\n\n\nAlternatively, prostaglandin selectivity was determined using a \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n competitition ELISA. Plates were coated with 50 μL/well of 5 μg/ml of goat anti-human IgG (Fc) (Thermo Scientific # 31170, Hudson, NH) or goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc) (Thermo Scientific # 31125, Hudson, NH) in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 \n°\nC. The following day plates were flicked and blotted dry. Plates were blocked with 200 μL/well of Superblock (Thermo Scientific # 37515, Hudson, NH), 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were flicked and blotted dry. Monoclonal antibodies were diluted to 0.04 μg/ml in PBST (Abbott Bioresearch Center, Worcester, MA)/ 10% Superblock and 50 μL of each was added to each well (2ng/well) of the pre-blocked ELISA plate and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Wells were washed 3 times with PBS/ 0.1% Tween-20. H-PGE\n2\n (Perkin Elmer # NET-428, Waltham, MA) was diluted in PBST/ 10% Superblock to 6nM (2X stock). Each prostaglandin (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) was prepared in PBST + 10% Superblock at various concentrations ranging from 2000 μM (2X stock) to 0.00004 μM (2X). Equal volumes of the \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n solution and of each prostaglandin dilution were mixed. Fifty microliters of this mixture was then added to each well of the plate and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Wells were washed manually 6 times with PBST/ 10% Superblock and 50 μL of scintillation fluid (Perkin Elmer # 6013621, Waltham, MA) added to each well. Plates were read using a TopCount reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) with a 5 minute count delay. IC\n50\n number was determined using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The cross reactivity index was then calculated by IC50 of PGE\n2\n/ICso of other prostaglandin(s)\n\n\nExample l.l.C: Measurement of Functional Activity Of Anti Prostaglandin E? Antibodies\n\n\nTo examine the functional activity of the anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies of the invention, the antibodies were used in the following in vitro and in vivo assays that measure the ability of an antibody to inhibit PGE\n2\n activity.\n\n\nExample l.l.C.l: EP4 Bioassav\n\n\nThe ability of anti-PGE\n2\n antibody to inhibit cellular response of PGE\n2\n in vitro was determined in a Ca\n++\n flux assay in HEK293 Ga 16 cells (Abbott Bioresearch Center, Worcester, MA) stably transfected with human EP4 receptor. In brief, an expression \n\n plasmid encoding one of the four human PGE2 receptors, EP4, and an expression plasmid encoding Ga 16, were co-transfected into human embryonic kidney cell line 293 cells (ATCC# CRL1573, Manassas, Virginia). The stable clones co-expressing both human EP4 and Ga 16 protein were selected using standard methods (Joseph Sambrook and David W. Russell. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual Publisher. Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001) and used for the EP4 bioassay.\n\n\nThe HEK293 Ga 16 cells were plated in black/clear poly-D-lysine plates (Corning #3667, Corning, NY) and incubated with a Ca\n++\n-sensitive dye (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) for 90 minutes. Stock PGE\n2\n (in 200 proof ethanol) was diluted with FLIPR buffer [containing IX HBSS (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA), 20 mM HEPES\n\n\n(Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA), 0.1% BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 2.5 mM Probenecid (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)]. Anti-PGE2 antibodies or isotype matched control antibodies were also pre-diluted in FLIPR buffer. 25 μl of PGE\n2\n or pre-incubated PGE\n2\n/antibody mixture was added to the wells pre-plated with cells. The dose response of PGE\n2\n was determined on a serial titration of PGE\n2\n and using FLIPRl or Tetra (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and EC50 was determined using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). For testing antibodies, PGE\n2\n at EC50 concentration was incubated with varying concentrations of test antibodies or isotype matched antibody (negative control) (ABC) for 20 minutes, and added to dye-loaded human EP4 in HEK293 Ga 16 cells. Ca \n+\n flux was monitored using FLIPRl and data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).\n\n\nExample 1.1.C.2: Competitive Inhibition of PGE2 Binding to PGE2 Receptors by Anti Prostaglandin E2 Antibodies Using \n3\nH-PGEi\n\n\nCompetitive inhibition of PGE\n2\n binding to PGE\n2\n receptors, for example EP4 or EP3, by an anti-PGE\n2\n antibody are determined using a cell-based or membrane based receptor binding assay using \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n (ProstaglandinE2, [5,6,8,11,12,14,15-3H(N)], Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA. Cat# NET428250UC).\n\n\nCells endogenously expressing or stably overexpressing EP4 receptor (i.e., HEK293-EP4 cells or HEK293-EP4-Gαl6 cells used for EP4 bioassay) (10\n5\n cells/mL) are grown overnight in a 24-well plate in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)/ \n\n 10% FCS (Sigma #T8665, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The medium is removed and 100 μl binding buffer (medium without FCS) is added. The plate is placed on ice for 10 minutes. Non-radioactive PGE\n2\n (0-1 μM) is added together with tracer (40 pM Of \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n) in 100 μl volume. Equilibrium receptor binding is performed for 90 minutes at 4°C. The medium is removed and the cells are washed four times with 200 μl cold medium. The cells are harvested by adding 20 μl 0.5 M NaOH. The lysate is transferred to a liquid scintillation plate. 100 μl Aquasafe 500 (Zinsser Analytic, Frankfurt, Germany) plus LSC cocktail (Lumac LSC, Groningen, The Netherlands) is added to each well and mixed. The cell-bound radioactivity is determined by liquid scintillation counting. For most agonist-receptor interactions, it is assumed that receptor binding inhibition by agonist (PGE\n2\n) follows a one-site model. The EC50, K\n1\n and Ka values are calculated using the GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).\n\n\nInhibition of an anti-PGE\n2\n antibody on the binding of \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n (ProstaglandinE2, [5,6,8,11,12,14,15-3H(N)], Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA. Cat# NET428250UC) to the EP3 receptor was performed using membrane preparations from cells that over-express the EP3 receptor (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Before the binding assay, 50 μl/well of 0.3% Polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to a Unifilter-96 GF/B filter plate (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and placed at 4°C for one hour until ready for use. A 1:3 dilution of antibody was prepared at 2X concentration in binding buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, ImM EDTA, 0.2% BSA). \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n was prepared at 2X concentration in binding buffer. 50 μl of a serial 3 fold dilution of antibody was then added to each well containing 50 μl of 200 pM \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n, mixed well and allowed to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. Frozen membranes were thawed and resuspended in binding buffer. 5μg of membrane was added to each well. Mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes before filtering onto pretreated GF/B filtration plates using a Packard 96 well harvester. Plates were then dried for one hour before adding Microscint™20 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Plates were then sealed and counted on the TopCount reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μM cold PGE\n2\n. The measured radioactivity (cpm) was used to determine IC50 values using Graphpad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).\n\n\nExample 1.1.C.3: Competitive Inhibition of PGE2 Binding to PGE2 Receptors by Anti Prostaglandin E2 Antibodies Using a Cell Based FACS Assay \n\n Competitive inhibition of PGE2 binding to PGE2 receptors, for example EP4, by an anti- PGE\n2\n antibody can be determined using a cell-based FACS assay using PGE\n2\n- biotinimide (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan. Cat# 10006987) and Streptavidin- R-Phycoerythrin (SA-RPE; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, Cat# 15-4301). Cells (IxIO\n6\n) endogenously expressing or stably overexpressing EP4 (i.e., HEK293-EP4 cells or HEK293-EP4-Gαl6 cells used for EP4 bioassay) are cultivated in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA s/10% FCS (Sigma #T8665, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Cells are harvested and washed several times with 500 μl washing buffer (PBS/1% BSA). Cells are resuspended in 500 μl FACS binding buffer (medium without FCS). 20 μl PGE\n2\n- biotinimide is added to the cell suspension and incubated at 4°C for 1 hour. Cells are washed with washing buffer three times. The cells are resuspended in 500 μl FACS binding buffer and 20 μl SA-RPE is added to the cells and incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes. Cells are then resuspended in 500 μl FACS binding buffer and the binding of PGE\n2\n on the cell surface is analyzed by flow cytometry. The inhibition of an anti-PGE\n2\n antibody can be determined by pre-incubating the cells with a titration of anti-PGE\n2\n antibody before incubation with PGE\n2\n-biotinimide and SA-RPE.\n\n\nExample 1.2: Generation Of Anti-Prostaglandin E2 Monoclonal Antibodies By Hybridoma Approach\n\n\nAnti -prostaglandin E\n2\n mouse monoclonal antibodies were obtained as follows:\n\n\nExample 1.2.A: Immunization Of Mice With A Prostaglandin E?-Thyroglobulin Conjugate\n\n\nTwenty micrograms of PGE\n2\n/thyroglobulin conjugate mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant (Pierce, Rockford, IL) or Immunoeasy adjuvant (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was injected subcutaneously into five 6-8 week-old Balb/C mice, five C57B/6 mice, and five AJ mice on Day 1. On days 24, 38, and 49, 25 μg of PGE\n2\n/thyroglobulin conjugate mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant or Immunoeasy adjuvant was injected subcutaneously into the same mice. On days 84, 112, or 144, mice were injected intravenously with 1 μg PGE\n2\n/thyroglobulin conjugate. \n\n Example 1.2.B: Generation of Hybridomas\n\n\nSplenocytes obtained from the immunized mice described in Example 1.2.A were fused with SP2/O-Ag-14 cells at a ratio of 5: 1 according to the established method described in Kohler, G. and Milstein, Nature, 256:495 (1975) to generate hybridomas. Fusion products were plated in selection media containing azaserine (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and hypoxanthine (Pierce, Rockford, IL) in 96-well plates at a density of 2.5xlO\n6\n spleen cells per well. Seven to ten days post fusion, macroscopic hybridoma colonies were observed. Supernatant from each well containing hybridoma colonies was tested by ELISA (as described in Example l . l.A) for the presence of antibody to PGE\n2\n.\n\n\nPGE\n2\n was conjugated to several different carrier proteins, including bovine thyroglobulins, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, bovine serum albumin, and ovalbumin. (Amiram, et al. Eur. J. Biochem. 53 : 145- 150 (1975)). Mice were immunized with one of these conjugated PGE\n2\n-protein complexes as described in Example I.2.A. Spleen cells from immunized mice were then fused to generate hybridomas as described in Example 1.2. B. The hybridomas producing antibodies specific for PGE\n2\n were isolated and the antibodies characterized using a biotinylated PGE\n2\n ELISA as described in Example l. l.A.\n\n\nExample 1.2.C: Identification And Characterization Of Anti-Prostaglandin E? Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\nHybridomas producing antibodies that bind PGE\n2\n, generated according to\n\n\nExamples 1.2. B, were scaled up and cloned by limiting dilution.\n\n\nSeveral antibodies, named 19C9, 4F10 and 15F10 specific for PGE\n2\n were isolated. The affinities of these antibodies were determined by ELISA using biotinylated PGE\n2\n as described in Example l. l.A (Figures 1 and 2). The specificity of these antibodies for PGE\n2\n was further determined by a competition ELISA with various prostaglandins as described in Example 1.1. B (Table 2).\n\n\nTable 2: Affinity and Cross Reactivity of 19C9, 4F10, 15F10, and 2B5 Antibodies \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Human Anti Prostaglandin E? Antibodies By In Vitro Display Technology\n\n\nExample 2.1: Human Anti Prostaglandin E? Antibodies Selected From Non- Immune Human Antibody Libraries By In Vitro Display Technology\n\n\nUsing PROfusion™ mRNA display, human anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies were selected from non-immune human antibody libraries by in vitro display technology in the single chain Fv (scFv) format. Antibody amino acid sequences that encoded biotinylated PGE\n2\n- binding scFv proteins were collected using streptavidin or neutravidin magnetic beads and further enriched from the libraries by multiple rounds of selection. Bulk output scFv nucleic acid sequences were subcloned into plasmid DNA suitable for bacterial propagation and individual bacterial colonies were picked for scFv sequence analysis and confirmation of their PGE\n2\n binding by the same antigen binding assay used in the library selection. VH and VL DNA of PGE\n2\n-binding scFv clones was then separately subcloned into respective human IgG-expressing heavy chain and light chain vectors, and transfected into COS7 cells for IgG expression. The human IgG-containing COS7 media were then used to confirm PGE\n2\n binding by ELISA as described in Example l. l.A (Table 3).\n\n\nTable 3: Binding of PROfusion Library Derived PGE\n7\n Antibodies To PGE\n7\n- Biotinamide (OD4sn)\n\n\n \n\n o I 0.07 I 0.04 I o.ii I 0.04 I 0.08 I 0.08 I 0.07 I 0.03 I\n\n\nTable 4 provides a list of amino acid sequences of VH and VL regions of human anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies derived from the PROfusion TM mRNA display library.\n\n\nTable 4 List of Amino Acid Sequences of VH and VL regions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3: Generation And Characterization Of Recombinant Anti Prostaglandin E? Antibodies According To Solved Protein Sequence By A Combination Of Edman Sequencing, Mass Spectrum Analysis And BLAST\n\n\nThe protein sequence of hybridoma-derived mouse antibodies specific for PGE\n2\n was generated by analyzing amino acid sequences using a combination of Edman degradation, mass spectrum analysis and BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, NCBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD) as described previously (Pham, V. et al. Analyt. Biochem.352:77-86 (2006)). 0.45mg of anti-PGE\n2\n antibody was reduced with 100 mM DTT (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to light chain and heavy chain. The light chains and heavy chains of the anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies were separated by reverse phase HPLC on \n\n Shimadzu HPLC system (Shimadzu Scientifc Instruments, Columbia, MD) with a Vydac C- 18 reverse phase column (H-P Separations Group, Hesperia, CA). The molecular weights of the light and heavy chains were measured on the Applied Biosystems API QSTAR Pulsar i mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and Agilent Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). N terminal sequencing of the light chains was performed in solution on PE Applied Biosystems 494/785A/140C/610A Protein-Peptide Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 45uL of light chain of the anti-PGE2 2B5 antibody was loaded on the center of the filter and 42 cycles were performed. The N-terminal of heavy chain of the anti-PGE\n2\n antibody was blocked with pyroglutamic acid and it could not be sequenced directly by Edman degradation. Prior to N-terminal Edman sequencing the heavy chain, the heavy chain N terminal was deblocked using pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). 80 μg of anti- PGE\n2\n antibody was reduced with 50 mM DTT at 37 \n0\nC for 30 minutes. 0.42 μl of 0.5 M EDTA, pH 7.5 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added to the reduced sample to a final EDTA concentration of 1 mM. 50 μl reconstituted recombinant pyrococcus furiosus pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to the sample. After incubating the sample solution at 40 \n0\nC for 15 hours, the temperature was increased to 60 \n0\nC for an additional two hours. An additional 10 μl of the reconstituted pyrococcus furiosus pyroglutamate aminopeptidase was added and the sample was incubated at 60 \n0\nC for an additional hour. 4 μl of the sample was used for LC/MS analysis at 15 hour, 17 hour, and 18 hour time points to monitor the extent of the de-blocking process. When the de-blocking reaction was complete, the solution was concentrated by speed-vacuum (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY) to about 100 μl. The de-blocked heavy chain was separated from light chain by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membrane (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for Edman Sequencing (Mall, HD, Methods Enzymol. 27:942-1010 (1973)).\n\n\nTo obtain the internal peptide sequence of an anti-PGE\n2\n antibody, the antibody was digested with multiple proteases with or without alkylation treatment. The sample was first reduced with DTT. The reduced sample was either digested directly with a protease or alkylated with iodoacetamide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) before digestion.\n\n\nProteases used in this study include trypsin, glu-C, asp-N and chymotrypsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Fractions of protease digested peptides were separated by HPLC and each \n\n fraction was collected in a separate eppendorf tube for either MS or Edman sequencing. For LC/MS/MS analysis, MALDI-MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), nano- LC/ESI-MS/MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with either LCQ-deca, API QStar Pulsar (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and Agilent Q-TOF (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) were used. HPLC conditions were mobile Phase A= 0.1% Formic acid; mobile Phase B= 80% ACN/20 % 0.1% Formic acid. A 1-3 hour gradient (5-50% B) was applied. For Edman sequencing, the fractions containing peptides resulting from protease digestion were transferred to PVDF membrane by a ProSorb cartridge (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each fraction was diluted to 100 μl of 0.1% TFA solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). After wetting the PVDF membrane (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in the reservoir with 10 μl methanol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), the sample was added to the reservoir. The sample was removed from the reservoir and the PVDF membrane was air dried. The PVDF membrane was punched out, 5 μl of 10% diluted Biobrene solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added and the membrane dried completely. After washing the PVDF membrane with 15 μl 0.1% TFA for 15 seconds, the surface was wiped with filter paper. 4 μl of methanol was added to the PVDF membrane and allowed to dry thoroughly. The dried PVDF membrane was used for Edman Sequencing.\n\n\nGermline sequences of the VH and VL of an anti-PGE\n2\n antibody were determined by alignment of the solved variable regions of heavy chain and light chain according to the above methods with the VH and VL database of mouse germline sequences (Ig- BLAST, NCBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD). For the regions unsolved by MS and Edman sequencing, the closest germline sequence was assigned. The possible hot spot mutations were identified manually to match the experimental molecular weight of the heavy chain and light chain of an anti-PGE\n2\n antibody determined by MS respectively. The protein sequence of an anti-PGE\n2\n antibody was solved using the above method.\n\n\nSeveral versions of the recombinant anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies (2B5-7.0, 2B5-8.0 and 2B5-9.0) were constructed based on this solved protein sequence, each having different residues in a few unsolved positions (Table 5). The testing of these recombinant antibodies is described in Example 4. Although the amino acid sequence of antibody CDRs are critical for binding specificity, potency and affinity of the antibody, subsititutions, alterations, deletions or additions of a few residues in the frameworks and even CDRs may still largely maintain the binding specificity, potency, and affinity of an \n\n antibody. A version of an antibody with at least one or a few such substitution(s), alterations, deletions or additions is still within the scope of the invention. An alignment of VH and VL regions of anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies (2B5-7.0, 2B5-8.0 and 2B5-9.0) is shown in Figure. 8.\n\n\nTable 5: Several Versions Of The Solved Protein Sequences For A Mouse Anti-PGE? Antibody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4: Recombinant Anti-Prostaglandin E? Antibodies\n\n\nExample 4.1: Construction And Expression Of Recombinant Anti -Prostaglandin E? Antibodies\n\n\nDNA encoding the heavy chain variable regions of mouse anti-PGE2 antibodies\n\n\n2B5-7.0, 2B5-8.0 or 2B5-9.0 was fused to a cDNA fragment encoding either a human IgGl constant region, a mouse IgGl constant, or a mouse IgG2a constant region by homologous recombination in bacteria. (Zhang, Y et al. Nature Biotechnol. 18(12): 1314- 7 (2000)). DNA encoding the light chain variable regions of 2B5-7.0, 2B5-8.0 or 2B5- 9.0 was fused to a human kappa constant region or mouse kappa constant region. Id.\n\n\nFull-length antibodies were transiently expressed in 293 cells by co-transfection of heavy \n\n and light chain cDNAs ligated into the pTT3 expression plasmids. (Durocher, Y et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 30(2):E9 (2002)). Cell supernatants containing recombinant chimeric antibody were purified by Protein A Sepharose chromatography and bound antibody was eluted by addition of acid buffer. Antibodies were neutralized and dialyzed into PBS. (Making and Using Antibodies: A Practical Handbook. Edited by Gary C. Howard and Matthew R. Kaser. Published by CRC (2006)).\n\n\nThe purified chimeric anti-PGE2 monoclonal antibodies 2B5-7.0, 2B5-8.0 and 2B5-9.0 were then tested for their ability to bind to PGE\n2\n in an ELISA assay as described in Example 1.1.A (Table 6) and for their selectivity in a competition ELISA as described in Example 1.1. B (Table 6). All three recombinant anti-PGE2 monoclonal antibodies 2B5-7.0, 2B5-8.0 and 2B5-9.0 potently bound to PGE\n2\n with a similar specificity for PGE\n2\n. 2B5-8.0 demonstrated the highest binding ability to PGE\n2\n and was selcted for further characterization in an EP4 bioassay to characterize its ability to neutralize PGE\n2\n bioactivity and in a \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n competition ELISA to characterize its prostaglandin selectivity using a full panel of prostaglandins. 2B5-8.0 potently inhibited PGE\n2\n induced calcium influx in the EP4 bioassay as described in Examples 1.1. C (Table 6).\n\n\nTable 6: Characterization Of PGE^Binding, Prostaglandin Binding Selectivity And PGE\n2\n Neutralization Potency Of Engineered Anti-PGEi Mabs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.2: Construction And Expression Of Humanized Anti-Prostaglandin E? Antibodies\n\n\nExample 4.2.1: Selection Of Human Antibody Frameworks\n\n\nHumanization was based on amino acid sequence homology, CDR cluster analysis, frequency of use among expressed human antibodies, and available information on the crystal structures of human antibodies. Taking into account possible effects on antibody binding, VH- VL pairing, and other factors, murine residues were mutated to human residues where murine and human framework residues were different, with a few exceptions. Additional humanization strategies were designed based on an analysis of human germline antibody sequences, or a subgroup thereof, that possessed a high degree of homology, i.e., sequence similarity, to the actual amino acid sequence of the murine antibody variable regions.\n\n\nHomology modeling was used to identify residues unique to the murine antibody sequences that are predicted to be critical to the structure of the antibody CDRs. A reference protein sharing sequence similarity to the target protein of interest and for which three dimensional coordinates are known was used to obtain initial coordinates and guidance for their further refinement. The primary sequences of the reference and target proteins are aligned such that coordinates of identical portions of the two proteins are \n\n aligned. Coordinates for mismatched portions of the two proteins, e.g., from residue mutations, insertions, or deletions, are constructed from generic structural templates and energy refined to insure consistency with the already aligned model coordinates. This computational protein structure may be further refined or employed directly in modeling studies.\n\n\nThe murine variable heavy and variable light chain gene sequence of 2B5-8.0 was separately aligned against 44 human immunoglobulin germline variable heavy chain or 46 germline variable light chain sequences (derived from NCBI Ig BlAST website at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/retrieveig.html.) using Vector NTI software. A combination of BLAST searching and visual inspection was used to identify suitable reference structures. Sequence identity of 25% between the reference and target amino acid sequences is considered the minimum necessary to attempt a homology modeling exercise. Sequence alignments were constructed manually and model coordinates were generated with the program Jackal (Petrey, D., et al. Proteins 53 (Suppl. 6):430-435 (2003)). For 2B5-8.0 humanization, based on a homology search against human V and J segment sequences, the VH segment VH1-18 and the J segment JH4 were selected to provide the frameworks for the humanized heavy chain variable region for 2B5-8.0. For the 2B5-8.0 light chain variable region, the VL segment 01 and the J segment JK4 were used (see Tables 7 and 8). The identity of the framework amino acids between 2B5-8.0 VH and the acceptor human VHl -18 and JH4 segments was 80.2%, while the identity between 2B5-8.0 VL and the acceptor human 01 and JK4 segments was 90.3%. Although a specific pair of preferred human framework acceptors VH/JH and VL/JK was selected as acceptors for humanization of 2B5-8.0, it is known in the art that other human framework acceptors with sequence identity of minimum 25% to mouse framework can also be used for humanization of 2B5-8.0 and are therefor within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nTable 7: Heavy Chain Acceptor Sequences For 2B5-8.0 Humanization\n\n\n \n\n Table 8: Light Chain Acceptor Sequences For 2B5-8.0 Humanization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary sequences of the murine and human framework regions of the selected antibodies share significant identity. Residue positions that differed were candidates for inclusion of the murine residue in the humanized sequence in order to retain the observed binding potency of the murine antibody. Such framework region amino acid substitutions (human residues that are back mutated to mouse residues) at a key residue are called framework back mutations, wherein the key residue is selected from the group consisting of a residue adjacent to a CDR; a glycosylation site residue; a rare residue; a residue capable of interacting with PGE2; a residue capable of interacting with a CDR; a canonical residue; a contact residue between heavy chain variable region and light chain variable region; a residue within a Vernier zone; and a residue in a region that overlaps between a Chothia-defined variable heavy chain CDRl and a Kabat-defined first heavy chain framework. In an embodiment, the human acceptor framework comprises at least one Framework Region amino acid substitution, wherein the amino acid sequence of the framework is at least 65% identical to the sequence of the human acceptor framework and comprises at least 70 amino acid residues identical to the human acceptor framework. For humanization of 2B5-8.0, the framework region amino acid substitution at a key residue is selected from the group consisting of M (human) to I\n\n\n(mouse) at position 48, V (human) to A (mouse) at position 68, M (human) to L (mouse) at position 70, and T (human) to V (mouse) at position 72 in the heavy chain variable region; and I (human) to V (mouse) at position 2 and V (human) to L (mouse) at position 3 in the light chain variable region.\n\n\nThe likelihood that a given framework residue would impact the binding properties of the antibody depends on its proximity to the CDR residues. Therefore, using the model structures, the residues that differ between the murine and human sequences were ranked according to their distance from any atom in the CDRs that likely contact PGE\n2\n. Those residues that fell within 4.5 A of any CDR atom were identified as \n\n most important and were deemed candidates for retention of the murine residue in the humanized antibody (i.e., frame work back mutation).\n\n\nFor humanization of the 2B5-8.0 antibody variable regions, the general approach provided in the present invention was as follows. First, a molecular model of the 2B5-8.0 antibody variable regions was constructed with the aid of the computer programs\n\n\nABMOD and ENCAD (Levitt, M., J. MoI. Biol. 168: 595-620 (1983)). Next, based on a homology search against human V and J segment sequences, the VH segment VHl -18 (The Immunoglobulin Facts Book. 2001, authored by Marie-Paule Lefranc and Gerald Lefranc, published byAcademic Press) and the J segment JH4 (Id.) were selected to provide the frameworks for the humanized heavy chain variable region for 2B5-8.0. For the 2B5-8.0 light chain variable region, the VL segment 01 (Id.) and the J segment JK4 (Id.) were used. The identity of the framework amino acids between 2B5-8.0 VH and the acceptor human VH1-18 and JH4 segments was 80.2%, while the identity between 2B5- 8.0 VL and the acceptor human 01 and JK4 segments was 90.3%. The computer model did not identify any significant contact residues with the CDRs that need to be back mutated. No further replacements were done.\n\n\nNine different versions of humanized 2B5-8.0, named as HU2B5.1, HU2B5.2, HU2B5.3, HU2B5.4, HU2B5.5, HU2B5.6, HU2B5.7, HU2B5.8 and HU2B5.9, were designed. The nine antibodies were different in the framework back mutations at positions 48, 68, 70, and 72 in the heavy chain variable region and positions 2 and 3 in the light chain variable region as described above.\n\n\nTable 9: CDRs of Mouse Anti-PGE? Antibody 2B5-8.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 10: Nine Humanized Anti-PGE\n2\n Antibodies With CDRs of 2B5-8.0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.2.2: Construction Of Humanized Antibodies\n\n\nThe in silico designed humanized antibodies described in Example 4.2.1 were constructed de novo using oligonucleotides. For each variable region cDNA, 6 oligonucleotides of 60-80 nucleotides each were designed to overlap each other by 20 nucleotides at the 5 ' and/or 3 ' end of each oligonucleotide. In an annealing reaction, all 6 oligos were combined, boiled, and annealed in the presence of dNTPs. DNA polymerase I, Large (Klenow) fragment (New England Biolabs #M0210, Beverley, MA.) was added to fill-in the approximately 40bp gaps between the overlapping oligonucleotides. PCR was then performed to amplify the entire variable region gene using two outermost primers containing overhanging sequences complementary to the multiple cloning site in a modified pTT3 vectors. The PCR products derived from each cDNA assembly were separated on an agarose gel and the band corresponding to the predicted variable region cDNA size was excised and purified. The variable heavy region was inserted in-frame into a cDNA fragment encoding a wild-type human IgGl constant region, or a human IgGl constant region containing 2 hinge-region amino acid mutations by homologous recombination in bacteria. (Zhang, Y et al. Nature Biotechnol. 18(12): 1314-7 (2000)). The mutations were a leucine to alanine change at position 234 (EU numbering) and a \n\n leucine to alanine change at position 235 (Lund et al. J. Immunol, 147:2657 (1991)). The variable light chain region was inserted in- frame into a human kappa constant region by homologous recombination. Bacterial colonies were isolated, plasmid DNA extracted, and cDNA inserts were sequenced in their entirety. pTT3 vectors containing correct humanized heavy and light chains corresponding to each antibody were co-transfected into HEK293 cells to transiently produce full-length humanized anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies. Cell supernatants containing recombinant chimeric antibody were purified by Protein A Sepharose chromatography and bound antibody was eluted by the addition of 0.1N acetic acid/0.15M NaCl (pH3.0). Antibodies were neutralized and dialyzed in PBS.\n\n\nExample 4.2.3: Alternative Construction of Humanized Anti-PGE2 Antibodies\n\n\nThis example describes the humanization of an anti-PGE\n2\n antibody. Humanization of the murine monoclonal antibody 2B5-8.0 was carried out essentially according to the procedure of Queen, C, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 86: 10029- 10033 (1989). First, human V segments with high homology to the 2B5-8.0 VH or VL amino acid sequences were identified. Next, the complementarity-determining region (CDR) sequences together with framework amino acids important for maintaining the structures of the CDRs were grafted into the selected human framework sequences. In addition, human framework amino acids that were found to be rare in the corresponding V region subgroup were substituted with consensus amino acids to reduce potential immunogenicity.\n\n\nFor humanization of the 2B5-8.0 variable regions, the general approach provided in the present invention was followed. First, a molecular model of the 2B5-8.0 variable regions was constructed with the aid of the computer programs ABMOD and ENCAD (Levitt, M., J. MoI. Biol. 168: 595-620 (1983)). Next, based on a homology search against human V and J segment sequences, the VH segment MUCl-I 'CL (Griffiths, A.D., et al., EMBO J. 12: 725-734 (1993)) and the J segment JH4 (Ravetch, J.V., et al., Cell 27: 583-591 (1981)) were selected to provide the frameworks for the Hu2B5-8.0 heavy chain variable region. For the Hu2B5-8.0 light chain variable region, the VL segment TR1.37'CL (Portolano, S., et al., J. Immunol. 151 : 2839-2851 (1993)) and the J segment JK2 (Hieter, P. A., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 257: 1516-1522 (1982)) were used. The identity of the framework amino acids between 2B5-8.0 VH and the acceptor human \n\n MUCl-I 'CL and JH4 segments was 76%, while the identity between 2B5-8.0 VL and the acceptor human TRl.37'CL and JK2 segments was 84%.\n\n\nAt framework positions in which the computer model suggested significant contact with the CDRs, the amino acids from the mouse V regions were substituted for the original human framework amino acids. For humanization of 2B5-8.0, the framework region amino acid substitution at a key residue is selected from the group consisting of M (human) to I (mouse) at position 48, R (human) to K (mouse) at position 67, V (human) to A (mouse) at position 68, 1 (human) to L (mouse) at position 70 and R (human) to V (mouse) at position 72 in the heavy chain variable region; and D (human) to V (mouse) at position 75 in the light chain variable region. In addition, a few amino acids have been changed to the consensus amino acids in the same human variable domain subgroups to eliminate potential immunogenicity, which includes A to T substitution at position 76 in the heavy chain variable region, and E to D substitution at position 1 and L to I substitution at position 2 in the light chain variable region.\n\n\nThe protein sequences of the CDR grafted variable domains (VH and VL of Hu2B5.Pl) and the variable domains which incorporated all the back mutations and consensus substitutions (VH and VL of Hu2B5.P2) based on this humanization analysis are provided below. It is understood in general that any humanized version with one or a few such back mutations and consensus substitutions fall within the scope of this invention. Antibody E comprised VH Hu2B5.P2 and VL Hu2B5.P2; Antibody F comprised VH Hu2B5.P2 and VL Hu2B5.Pl; Antibody G comprised VH Hu2B5.Pl and VL Hu2B5.P2; and Antibody I comprised VH Hu2B5.Pl and VL Hu2B5.Pl.\n\n\nTable 11: Humanized Anti-PGEi Antibodies With CDRs of 2B5-8.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.2.4: Characterization of humanized anti PGE? antibodies\n\n\nThe ability of the purified humanized anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies to bind PGE\n2\n was determined by biotin-PGE\n2\n ELISA or 3H-PGE\n2\n radioimmunoassay as described in Example 1.1. A, Cross reactivity of the humanized anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies was determined by competitive biotin-PGE^ELISA or 3H-PGE\n2\n radioimmunoassay as described in Example 1.1.B. Inhibition of PGE\n2\n activity by the humanized anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies was determined using a EP4 bioassay as described in Examples 1.1. C.\n\n\nAll the humanized anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies were able to bind PGE\n2\n in a biotin- PGE\n2\n ELISA (Figures 6 and 7; Table 12). The humanized anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies were able to neutralize and block PGE\n2\n mediate calcium influx in an EP4 FLIPR assay. The alternative designed humanized anti- PGE\n2\n antibodies E, F, G and I were also able to bind to PGE\n2\n in a \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n ELISA (Table 13). Hu2B5.7 was selected for further characterization of prostaglandin binding specificity in a H-PGE\n2\n competition ELISA and demonstrated specificity to PGE\n2\n (Table 13).\n\n\nTable 12: Characterization of Humanized Antibodies\n\n\n \n\n Table 13: Characterization of Humanized AnU-PGE\n2\n Antibodies (continued)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 14: Characterization of Prostaglandin Selectivity for Humanized Anti-PGE? Antibodies Hu2B5.7 \n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.2.4.A: Humanized Anti PGE\n7\n Antibodies Block Binding Of PGE\n7\n To PGE\n7\n Receptor\n\n\nCompetitive inhibition of PGE\n2\n binding to PGE\n2\n receptors, for example EP4, by an anti- PGE\n2\n antibody can be determined by a cell-based or membrane based receptor binding assay using \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n as described in Example 1.1. D and a cell based FACS assay as described in Example 1.1. E.\n\n\nFor a therapeutic mAb with serum half-life between 10 and 20 days in man, the serum concentration is normally between 5-15 μg/ml, with a weekly or bi-weekly IV or SC 3mpk or less dosing regiment. Based on this calculation, hu2B5. l-Hu2B5.9 are likely to completely (100%) block PGE\n2\n binding to EP4 in vivo as a therapeutic mAb, at a \n\n serum concentration of 100 nM (or 15ug/ml), under a conventional dosing regimen of a monoclonal antibody.\n\n\nExample 4.2.5: Biophysico-Chemical Characterization of Humanized anti-PGE2 Antibodies\n\n\nCriteria tested ranged from general drug-like property parameters such as, parameters indicating intrinsic stability (differential scanning calorimetry or DSC), and general physical and chemical stability (e.g., purity including fragmentation and aggregation monitoring by SEC).\n\n\nAnalytical methods used for biophysico-chemical characterization:\n\n\nExample 4.2.5.1: Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)\n\n\nSize exclusion chromatography was used to separate proteins based on size. Proteins are carried in an aqueous mobile phase and through a porous stationary phase resin packed in a column. The retention time in the column is a function of the hydrodynamic size of the protein and the size of the pores in the packed resin bed. Smaller molecules can penetrate into smaller pores in the resin and are retained longer than larger molecules. Upon elution from the column the proteins are detected by UV absorbance. The SEC method used a TSK gel guard (TOSOH Biosciences, Montgomeryville, PA, cat. no. 08543) and a TSK gel G3000SWxL (TOSOH Biosciences, Montgomeryville, PA, cat. no. 08541). The mobile phase was 100 mM Na2HPO4, 200 mM Na2SO4, pH 7.0. The flow rate was 0.3 mL/minute. Injection volume was 20 μL of 1 mg/mL sample. The column temperture was room temperature. The autosampler temperature was 2-8\n0\nC. The total run time was 50 minutes. The detection was based on UV absorbance at 214 nm wavelength, with band width set at 8 nm, using reference wavelength at 360 nm with band width 100 nm.\n\n\nExample 4.2.5.1: Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)\n\n\nThe thermal stability of the anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies was assessed using a DSC instrument. The DSC instrument used was an automated VP-DSC equipment with Capillary Cell (Microcal, GE Healthcare Ltd./Microcal, Buckinghamshire, UK). Unfolding of molecules was studied applying a l°C/minute scan rate over a 25°C - 95°C \n\n temperature range for samples at 1 mg/mL. Additional measurement parameters applied were a fitting period of 16 seconds, a pre-scan wait time of 10 minutes, and measurements were performed in none- feedback mode.. Per individual measurement, 420 μL of sample/blank were filled into the DSC measurement sample holder, with a plate fill scheme as provided below. The thermograms obtained were fitted to a non two state model to obtain the midpoint temperatures and enthalpies of the different transitions.\n\n\nAn additional requirement for successful biologies development candidate is that the protein remains its native state and conformation. A protein in aqueous solution is in equilibrium between the native (folded) conformation and its denatured (unfolded) conformation. The stability of the native state is based on the magnitude of the Gibbs free energy (DG) of the system and the thermodynamic relationship between enthalpy (DH) and entropy (DS) changes. A positive DG indicates the native state is more stable than the denatured state - the more positive the DG, the greater the stability. For a protein to unfold, stabilizing forces need to be broken. Conformational entropy overcomes stabilizing forces allowing the protein to unfold at temperatures where entropy becomes dominant. DSC measures DH of protein unfolding due to heat denaturation. As a general rule it can be stated that the higher the transition midpoint (the Tm), the more stable the protein at lower temperatures. During the same experiment DSC also measures the change in heat capacity (DCp) for protein denaturation. Heat capacity changes associated with protein unfolding are primarily due to changes in hydration of side chains that were buries in the native state, but become solvent exposed in the denatured state. DSC has been shown to be a valuable predictor of liquid formulation stability for proteins and other biological macromolecules (Remmele, R.L. Jr., Gombotz, W.R., BioPharm 13, 36- 46, 2000, and; Remmele, R.L. Jr., Nightlinger, N.S., Srinivasen, S., Gombotz, W.R., Pharm. Res. 15, 200-208, 1998).\n\n\nExample 4.2.6: Stability Of Humanized Anti-PGE? Antibody Hu2B5.7 During Clone Selection Process\n\n\nExample 4.2.6.A: Stability Of Humanized Anti-PGE? Antibody Hu2B5.7 Using DSC and SEC\n\n\nThe stability of a series of clones (i.e., anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies) of the parent anti-\n\n\nPGE\n2\n antibody was assessed by using intrinsic thermodynamic clone stability \n\n determination using DSC (0.79 mg/mL clone concentration, formulated at pH 6 in a 10 mM citrate, 10 mM phosphate buffer) and by accelerated stability screening (0.79 mg/mL clone concentration, formulated at pH 6 in a 10 mM citrate, 10 mM phosphate buffer, for 7 days at 5O\n0\nC) where clone stability was monitored with SEC (Table 15).\n\n\nTable 15: Formation Of Aggregates And Fragments In Hu2B5 humanized antibody variants Hu2B5.1 - Hu2B5.9 Clone Samples As Determined By SEC (Start Of Stability Study)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 16: Formation Of Aggregates And Fragments In Hu2B5 humanized antibody variants Hu2B5.1 - Hu2B5.9 Clone Samples As Determined By SEC (1 Days Storage At 5O\n0\nC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables 15 and 16 provide the results of SEC testing for up to 7 days storage of the humanized anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies, showing the levels of monomer at the start and at the end of the accelerated stability screening. Hu2B5.7 and Hu2B5.9 revealed the highest monomer levels after 7 days accelerated stability screening. The results shown in Table 17 demonstrated that hu2B5.7 also had a very favorable intrinsic stability profile (DSC data) compared to other clones of the panel (e.g., Hu2B5.4).\n\n\nAn IgG antibody typically shows three unfolding transitions (Tm): unfolding of the intact antibody is associated with the melting of the CH2 domain in the Fc fragment, melting of the CH3 domain in the Fc fragment, and melting of the Fab fragment. In order to select anti-PGE\n2\n antibodies with desirable drug-like properties, clones with high Tm values and high intrinsic stability such as Hu2B5.7 were selected (Table 17) \n\n Table 17: Intrinsic Thermodynamic Clone Stability Determination Of Humanized Anti-PGE2 Antibody Clones Via DSC (0.79 mg/mL Clone Antibody Concentration, Formulated At pH 6 in a 10 mM Citrate, 10 mM Phosphate Buffer)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.2.6.B: Capillary Zone Electrophoresis of Hu2B5.1-Hu2B5.9\n\n\nCapillary zone electrophoresis is a capillary electrophoresis method in which the capillary is filled with buffer and the separation mechanism is based on differences in electrophoretic mobility of the analyte through the buffer. The electrophoretic mobility of a molecule is related to the charge-to-size ratio. A Beckman-Coulter ProteomeLab PA 800 (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) was used for the CZE analysis. A neutral capillary (eCAP neutral, 56 cm total length, 50μm I. D. Beckman-Coulter, P/N 477441, Fullerton, CA) was used. The method used a 30.2 cm capillary with a detection window 20.2 cm from the sample introduction inlet. The running buffer was 100 mM EACA (6- Aminocaproic acid, Sigma A7824- 100 G, St. Louis, MO) with 0.1% MC (from 1% Methylcellulose solution, Convergent Bioscience, cat# 101876, Toronto, ON, Canada), pH 5.5. \n\n The results showed that Hu2B5.1, Hu2B5.3, Hu2B5.5, Hu2B5.7, Hu2B5.9 migrated more basic (e.g., they had a shorter migration time) than Hu2B5.2, Hu2B5.4, Hu2B5.6, Hu2B5.8. This may be due to the fact that Hu2B5.1, Hu2B5.3, Hu2B5.5, Hu2B5.7, Hu2B5.9 all have R at heavy chain #84 amino acid, while the other four samples have S at the same position. All nine samples showed a main peak and minor acidic and basic species, but there was not much difference among the distribution of the different species.\n\n\nExample 4.3: Crystallization of Hu2B5.7 Complexed to PGE2\n\n\nThe Fab portion of Hu2B5.7 is complexed with PGE2 and crystals of the complex are generated as follows.\n\n\nExample 4.3.1: Preparation and Purification of Hu2B5.7 Fab Fragment\n\n\nTo prepare Hu2B5.7 Fab fragment, Hu2B5.7 IgG in 0.15 M PBS buffer is first concentrated to 2 mg/ml using an Ultrafree-15 Biomax 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) centrifugal filter device (Millipore). A papain gel slurry (Pierce) is pre-washed and charged in 2-3X with Buffer A (20 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 10 mM EDTA, 20 mM cysteine) at a 1 : 1 volume ratio. The concentrated antibody is then mixed with 50% papain gel slurry and incubated at 37 \n0\nC for 24 hours with vigorous shaking. The antibody/slurry mixture is centrifuged (Beckman 6KR) and the supernatant is loaded onto a PBS pre- equilibrated Superdex 75. A major peak is eluted and protein is pooled. A 25 mL Protein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia) is prepared by washing with 100 mL of PBS. The pooled antibody fragments are applied to the affinity column (2 mL/min flow rate). Fractions containing Hu2B5.7 Fab fragments (monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm) are collected in the flow-thru. Fractions containing a Hu2B5.7 Fab fragment concentration greater than 0.3 mg/mL (determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm) are pooled and frozen at -80 \n0\nC. Sample purity is assessed with SDS-PAGE.\n\n\nExample 4.3.2: PGE2/Hu2B5.7 Fab Complex Preparation\n\n\nPGE2 and Hu2b5.7 Fab protein are mixed at a 1 : 1 molar ratio and incubated for 1 hour at 4 \n0\nC. The complex sample is loaded onto a pre-equilibrated (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) Superdex 200 column at 0.5 ml/minute. The complex is pooled and concentrated to 24 mg/mL using an Ultrafree-15 Biomax 10 kDa molecular weight cut- \n\n off (MWCO) centrifugal filter device (Millipore) and frozen at -80\n0\nC. Sample purity is assessed with SDS-PAGE.\n\n\nExample 4.3.3: Crystallization of PGE2/Hu2B5.7 Fab Complex\n\n\nFrozen PGE2/Hu2B5.7 complex stock (-24 mg/mL) is thawed on ice. The complex (1.0 μL) is mixed with 1.0 μL of reservoir solution (1.75 M Ammonium Sulfate, 100 mM MES pH 6.5, 10 mM CaC12). The resulting drop is mixed in a sitting drop well (CrysChem sitting-drop plate) over the reservoir at about 18°C. Diamond-like crystals generally appeared within one week.\n\n\nExample 4.3.4: Cryoprotection and Flash Cooling of PGE2/Hu2B5.7 Fab Complex Crystals\n\n\nCrystals of PGE2/Hu2B5.7 Fab complex are harvested using a fiber loop in mother liquor + 20% glycerol. The crystals are subsequently flash-cooled by plunging into liquid nitrogen.\n\n\nExample 4.3.5: X-ray Diffraction Data Collection of PGE2/Hu2B5.7 Fab Complex\n\n\nX-ray diffraction data from PGE2/Hu2B5.7 Fab crystals are collected at the\n\n\nIMCA beamline at the Advanced Photon Source in Argonne, IL. The crystals are maintained at a temperature of 100 K with an Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream cooler during data collection. A total of 180 frames are collected at an oscillation range of 1.0°. The data are processed with the HKL2000 suite of programs (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). After determining the crystal orientation, the data are integrated with DENZO and scaled and merged with SCALEPACK, and placed on an absolute scale and reduced to structure factor amplitudes with TRUNCATE (French and Wilson, 1978). Five percent of the unique reflections are assigned, in a random fashion, to the \"free\" set, for calculation of the free R-factor (Rfree) (Brunger, 1992); the remaining 95% of the reflections constitute the \"working\" set, for calculation of the R-factor (R).\n\n\nExample 4.3.6: Molecular Replacement Solution and Refinement of PGE2/Hu2B5.7 Fab Complex Crystal Structure \n\n A maximum likelihood molecular replacement solution is determined using the program PHASER (Read, 2001). A total of six PGE2/Hu2B5.7 monomers are solved at 3.0 A resolution an appropriate space group. The search model is the crystal structure of Fab reported previously (Protein Data Bank entry IBJl; Muller et al. 1998). Coordinates are generated based on the molecular replacement solution.\n\n\nThe refinement of the PGE2/Hu2B5.7 Fab complex crystal structure begins with the molecular replacement solution coordinates, described above, in an appropriate space group. Refinement begins using rigid-body refinement by the program REFMAC available in the CCP4 suite of programs (Murshudov et al., 1997, Collaborative Computational Project, 1994). De novo PGE2 electron density is observed. Manual building of six PGE2 monomers is guided by the public PGE2 NMR structure IUZ (Moy et al., 2001) using the molecular graphics program O (Jones et al., 1991) and examination of 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc electron-density maps. The refinement program REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) is used for iterative rounds of restrained refinement resulting in the following statistics: R of 25.8% (Rfree 30.5%).\n\n\nExample 5.0: Pharmacokinetic Analyses\n\n\nExample 5.1: Pharmacokinetic Analysis Of Recombinant Mouse Anti-PGE2 Antibodies\n\n\nPharmacokinetic studies with mouse mAb 2B5.8.0 were carried out in Sprague Dawley rats and Balb/C mice. Male and female rats and mice were dosed intravenously or intraperitoneally (mice only) with a single dose of 4 mg/kg 2B5.8.0 and serum samples were analyzed using antigen capture based chemiluminescent MSD (Meso Scale Discovery) method (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, Maryland). Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis using WinNonlin.\n\n\nExample 5.1.1: Assay Used To Ouantitate 2B5.8.0 In PK Serum Samples\n\n\nThe following MSD assay was used to measure antibody concentration in rat and mouse serum. MSD streptavidin plates (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD) were washed with phosphate buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Plates were blocked with 250 μL/well blocking solution (MSD Block, Meso Scale \n\n Discovery, diluted to 3% final concentration in PBS) for 1 hour, covered, with shaking (600rpm) at room temperature. After washing, 70 μL of biotinylated PGE\n2\n (Prostoglandin E2-biotinamide, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan, cat# 10006987, lot# 190831-191028, O.Olug/mL in assay buffer) was added to each well. The plates were covered and incubated with shaking (600 rpm) for 1 hour at room temperature\n\n\nPrior to analysis, rat and mouse serum samples were thawed on ice, mixed gently, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 3 minutes at 4°C in an eppendorf centrifuge. Standard curve and control samples were prepared in rat and mouse serum. A Tecan Evo automated liquid handling station was used to dilute standard curve, high, medium, and low controls, and serum samples in assay buffer, keeping 1% final serum concentration constant. MSD plates were washed again and study samples, standard curve samples and blanks, as well as high, medium, and low controls were added (70μL/well). The plates were covered, and incubated for 1 hour with shaking (600 rpm) at room temperature.\n\n\nAfter incubation, the MSD plates were washed, and 70μL of sulfo-tagged goat anti-mouse IgG (Meso Scale Discovery; diluted to lug/mL in assay buffer) was added to each well. The MSD plates were covered, and incubated with shaking (600rpm) for 1 hour at room temperature, then the plates were washed and developed with 2x Read Buffer (Meso Scale Discovery). Chemilumeniscence was measured within ten minutes on the MSD Sector Imager 6000.\n\n\nStandard curves were analyzed using four-parameter logistic fit and sample concentrations were calculated by XLfit4 software version 2.2.1 Build 16, (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for each animal using Winonlin software version 5.0.1 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA) by noncompartmental analysis. Example 5.1.2: Pharmacokinetic Studies of 2B5.8.0 Carried Out In SD Rats And Balb/C Mice\n\n\nSurgically altered (jugular vein cannulated, JVC) and regular male and female Sprague-Dawley Rats (approximately seven weeks old, weighing 240-390 grams) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). The animals were housed in rooms maintained at constant temperature and humidity under 12hours \n\n light/dark cycle, fed with normal rodent chow and were allowed food and water ad libitum. Hydration and clinical conditions of the animals were monitored daily.\n\n\nMale and female Balb/c mice (weighing approximately 0.025 kg) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). The animals were allowed food and water ad libitum. Blood samples were collected (0.2 mL from the rats via the tail vein and by cardiac puncture from the mice) at various timepoints (5 mice at each timepoint) allowed to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature, centrifuged for 3 minutes at 13,200 rpm, the serum transferred to eppendorf tubes and stored frozen at -80\n0\nC.\n\n\nFollowing intravenous administration in rat, 2B5.8.0 exhibited bi-exponential decay, typical of antibodies. 2B5.8.0 clearance and volumes of distributions were low (Table 18), and half-life was long, Tl/2: 9.1 and 8.9 days (male and female respectively). Large inter-animal variability was seen among female rats, however not in males.\n\n\nFollowing IV administration in Balb/C mice, 2B5.8.0 showed very long half-lives (26.3 and 16.2 days, male and female respectively) with low clearance and volumes of distributions (Table 18). Following intraperitoneal administration in mice, at the early timepoints large inter animal variability was observed in the females. Absorption was slow, with high Cmax of 37-49 ug/ml reached by 1-2 days. The half-life was long (13.8- 16.1 days) and the bioavailability was good (65.8- 72.0%).\n\n\nTable 18; Main Pharmacokinetic Parameters Of 2B5.8.0 In Sprague-Dawlev Rats And Balb/C Mice\n\n\n \n\n Example 5.1.3: Pharmacokinetic Analysis Of Recombinant Humanized Anti-PGE2 hu2B5.7 and hu2B5.4\n\n\nPharmacokinetic studies with hu2B5.7 and hu2B5.4 were carried out in Sprague Dawley rats.

Hu2B5.7 and hu2B5.4 clearances and volumes of distributions were low and half-lives were long; Tl/2: 12.4 days for both antibodies (Table 19). After about 10-14 days, several animals exhibited unexpected drops in serum hu2B5.7 concentrations. These sudden drops may have been due to the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA); however, this was not confirmed. Animals with possible ADA responses were omitted from the final pharmacokinetic calculations. \n\n Table 19: Main Pharmacokinetic Parameters of hu2B5.7 and hu2B5.4 in Male Sprague-Dawley Rats After an Intravenous Dose of 4 mg/kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.4: In Vivo Efficacy Of Recombinant Mouse And Humanized PGE2 Antibodies\n\n\nThe in vivo efficacy of anti-PGE2 antibodies is assessed as follows.\n\n\nExample 4.4.1: In Vivo Efficacy Of Mouse And Humanized Anti-PGE2 Antibodies In a Carrageenan-Induced Footpad Edema Model\n\n\nCarrageenan-Induced Footpad Edema is an acute rodent model of innate immune function. The in vivo efficacy of mouse anti-PGE2 antibody 2B5-8.0 is assessed in a carragenan-induced paw edema model. The induction of paw inflammation with carrageenan is performed similarly as previously described (Joseph P. Portanova, et al. J. Exp. Med. 184: 883-891 (1996)). Intradermal (ID) injection of an inflammatory agent causes a rapid influx of neutrophils and fluid edema which peaks at approximately 4 hours, followed by an influx of macrophages and monocytes which peaks at approximately 48 hours. C57.BL/6 mice (8-10-week-old, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were injected ID in the rear footpad with 30μL of either PBS (left) or λ- carrageenen (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in PBS (right) at a concentration of 5.0 mg/mL (150μg/mouse). Rear footpad thickness was measured by Dyer spring caliper model #310-119 at baseline (time=0), and 4 hours post carrageenan challenge. Significant difference for paw thickness was determined by comparing mean paw swelling for each treatment group to vehicle in a Student's two-tailed t-test. Mice were given a dose titration of an anti-PGE antibody (2B5-8.0) intraperitonially (IP) 18 hours prior to carrageenan challenge, or Indomethacin, PO 2 hours prior to challenge. The endpoint measured was the difference in paw swelling (edema) between right and left paws 4 hours after treatment. The anti-PGE2 antibody inhibited paw edema dose- \n\n dependently, and provided a maximal 40-50% inhibition of paw swelling at 10 mg/kg, comparable to the maximal inhibition achieved by indomethacin (Table 20).\n\n\nTable 20: Paw Swelling In Mouse Carrageenan-Indcued Footpad Edema After\n\n\nAb Treatment\n\n\nVehicle Anti-PGE2 Indomethacin\n\n\n(PBS) (10 mg/kg, i.p.)

Portanova, et al. J. Exp. Med. 184: 883-891 (1996)). Hyperalgesia is induced by the injection of 0.1 ml of a 0.1% carrageenan solution in sterile saline (FMC Corp., Rockland, ME) into the hind footpad of a 200-g male Sprague Dawley rat (Charles River Laboratories, Portage, ME). A hyperalgesic response to thermal stimulation is determined in the same animals by the method of Hargreaves et al. Pain. 32:77-88 (1988)). Hind paws are exposed to radiant heat emitted from a high intensity projection bulb at selected times after injection. The amount of time in which each hind paw remains in contact with the heat source is measured to the nearest 0.1 s. The hyperalgesic response is expressed as the difference in the latency withdrawal period between carrageenan- and saline-injected paws of each animal. In certain experiments, rats are administered indomethacin by oral gavage in 0.5% Methocel/0.025% Tween 80 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) 1 hour before carrageenan administration. Other rats are injected intraperitoneally with mouse anti-PGE2 mAb, 2B5-8.0, or humanized anti-PGE2 antibody, Hu2B5.7, or isotype-matched antibody 18 hours before carrageenan injection.\n\n\nExample 4.4.2: In Vivo Efficacy Of Mouse Anti-PGE2 Antibodies In Collagen- Induced Arthritis \n\n Type II bovine collagen (lyophilized) was obtained from the University of Utah (Salt Lake City, UT). Male DBA/J mice (8-10-week-old, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were immunized intradermally at the base of the tail with 100 μL of emulsion containing 100 μg of type II bovine collagen dissolved in 0.1 N of acetic acid and 100 μg of heat- inactivated Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (Complete Freund's Adjuvant, Difco, Laurence, KS). Twenty-one days after immunization with collagen, mice were boosted IP with 1 mg of Zymosan A (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Following the boost, mice were monitored daily for arthritis. Each paw was scored by the following criteria: 0 = normal; 1 = swelling in one site, foot, or ankle; 2 = swelling in foot and ankle; and 3 = ankylosis. Scores were summed for each animal, and total average of all animals in each group was expressed as MAS. In addition to clinical scores, mice were also evaluated for paw-edema using Dyer spring calipers model #310-119. Mice were enrolled for the study between days 24 and 28 at the first clinical signs of disease. At the termination of the experiment, six paws from each group were harvested and stored in 10% neutral buffered formalin for micro CT and histology.\n\n\nMicro-computed tomography was performed on a Scanco μCT-40 unit (Scanco Medical AG) at 6OkVp at 160 μA. The hind paws (stored in 70% ethanol) were secured in imaging tubes and the tarsal bone volume was measured for a 1.8-mm section of the mouse ankle from the base of the tibia to the tarsal/metatarsal joint at a resolution of 18 μm. The raw micro-computed tomography image was then analyzed using the Scanco AG μCT Evaluation program.\n\n\nFor histopathology analysis, formalin-fixed paws were sectioned and stained with Gills 3 hematoxylin (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI) and eosin with phloxine (Newcomer Supply, Middleton, MI). Severity of disease was evaluated histologically using the following criteria: 0 = normal; 1 = minimal change; 2 = mild change; 3 = moderate change; and 4 = severe change. Scores were summed for each animal, and the total was expressed as an average of all animals in each group.\n\n\nThe therapeutic effects of anti-PGE2 alone was evaluated in mouse (male DBA/1 J) collagen-induced arthritis, a standard preclinical model for human rheumatoid arthritis. Drug treatment was initiated after the mice developed signs of arthritic disease after immunization with bovine type II collagen. Mice were scored visually for clinical \n\n signs of arthritis and the results were recorded as the mean arthritic score (MAS). Paw swelling and MAS monitored over time, were also represented as area under the curve (AUC) (Table 21). After disease onset, treatment with anti-PGE2 mAb 2B5 reduced the AUC for MAS by 22%.\n\n\nTable 21: Disease Score, Swelling And Bone Volume In Mouse CIA After Anti-\n\n\nPGE\n7\n 2B5-8.0 Treatment\n\n\nVehicle Anti-PGE2\n\n\n(PBS) (8 mg/kg, 2X/week, Lp.)\n\n\nMAS (AUC)\n\n\n74 + 7.3 57.4 + 6.7 (Score # days)\n\n\nPaw Swelling (AUC)\n\n\n14.3 + 1.6 8.4 + 1.3 (mm # days)\n\n\nBone Volume (mm\n3\n)\n\n\n1.2 + 0.2 1.6 + 0.1\n\n\nExample 4.4.2: In Vivo Efficacy Of Mouse Anti-PGE2 Antibodies In Adjuvant- Induced Arthritis\n\n\nThe in vivo efficacy of mouse anti-PGE2 antibody 2B5-8.0 is assessed in an adjuvant-induced arthritis model. Arthritis is induced in male Lewis rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) by footpad injection of Mycobacterium butyricum in mineral oil (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) as described previously. Dexamethasone and indomethacin (Sigma Chemical Co.) are suspended in Methocel/Tween and administered twice daily by gavage at dosages of 0.1 and 2 mg/kg, respectively. 2B5-8.0 and isotype control are administered daily at a dose of 10 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection. Treatments are initiated on day 15 post adjuvant injection and continued until final assessment of paw volume of uninjected contralateral paws on day 21. Mice are carefully examined twice weekly for the visual appearance of arthritis in peripheral joints, and scores for disease activity are determined.\n\n\nIncorporation By Reference\n\n\nThe contents of all cited references (including literature references, patents, patent applications, and websites) that maybe cited throughout this application are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety, as are the references cited therein. \n\n The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of immunology, molecular biology and cell biology, which are well known in the art.\n\n\nEquivalents\n\n\nThe invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof.

Description\n\n\n\n\n USE OF TAM RECEPTOR INHIBITORS AS IMMUNOENHANCERS AND TAM ACTIVATORS AS IMMUNOSUPPRESSORS\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.\n\n\n60/986,984, filed on November 9, 2007, U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/013,598, filed on December 13, 2007, and 61/083,462 filed on July 24, 2008 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE\n\n\nThis disclosure concerns compositions and methods for immunoenhancement or immunosuppression. In certain embodiments, the disclosure concerns methods of using a Tyro 3, AxI, and Mer (TAM) receptor inhibitor for immunoenhancement, for example as a vaccine adjuvant, or for the treatment of sepsis or other disorder where immunoenhancement is desired. In other embodiments, the disclosure concerns methods of using a TAM receptor agonist for immunosuppression, for example for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, post-transplant immunosuppression, or for the treatment of other disorders where immunosuppression is desired.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nThere are numerous diseases and conditions in which immunoenhancement would be desirable. For instance, the increasing threat of bio-weapons in both asymmetric warfare and terrorist attacks necessitates effective counter measures against pathogens that cause rapid onset diseases and morbidity, including Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and Ebola and Lassa viruses. Given the nature of these bio-agents, effective vaccination requires the induction of a rapid and potent response with as few doses as possible. Currently approved vaccines, as well as the vaccines under development, mostly rely on cell-free filtrates, recombinant antigens, and synthetic peptides, such as the 'anthrax vaccine adsorbed' antigen. Therefore, they lack the immunogenecity of the whole, killed pathogens used in traditional vaccines. In order to translate recombinant approaches into effective vaccination protocols, there is a need to develop powerful immunoadjuvants that safely increase the recombinant-antigen-based response. \n\n Similarly, severe sepsis could be treated with effective immunoenhancement. Sepsis refers to the systemic inflammatory response to an infection (see, for instance, American College of Chest Physicians Society of Critical Care Medicine, (1997) Chest, 101 : 1644-55), and can progress to severe sepsis, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction, and ultimately death. Severe sepsis is associated with hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and hypoperfusion abnormalities, including lactic acidosis, oliguria, and changes in mental status. Patients with severe sepsis often also exhibit immunosuppression, which compromises their ability to eradicate the primary infection and predisposes them to secondary opportunistic and/or nosocomial infections. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people suffer from sepsis and die.\n\n\nAdditionally, immunodeficiency, a state in which the immune system's ability to fight infectious disease is compromised or entirely absent, could be treated with immunoenhancement. Immunodeficiency can be either congenital or acquired, and an immunocompromised person is very vulnerable to opportunistic infections. HIV infection is a major cause of immunodeficiency, and an estimated 39.5 million people worldwide were living with HIV infection in the year 2006. Despite recent, improved access to antiretroviral treatment and care in many regions of the world, the AIDS epidemic claimed an estimated 2.8 million lives in 2005, of which more than half a million were children.\n\n\nFurthermore, immunoenhancement would be desirable for use with vaccines, for instance dendritic cell-based cancer vaccines, in which dendritic cells that have a natural or genetically engineered reactivity to a patients' cancer are expanded in vitro using a variety of means and then adoptively transferred into a cancer patient. Dendritic cell-based vaccines would be significantly more effective if used in conjunction with agents that boost the immune response of the host organism.\n\n\nMoreover, there are numerous diseases and conditions in which immunosuppression would be desirable. For example, many human diseases and disease syndromes, including systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, Sjόrgren's syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis), psoriasis, renal, pulmonary, and hepatic fibroses, type I diabetes, and multiple sclerosis, among others, result from chronic inflammation of the immune system. In addition, organ rejection following transplantation often is \n\n initiated by immune inflammation. In these settings, bacterial and viral infections almost always exacerbate inflammatory symptoms and disease. The acute inhibition of immune inflammation is therefore a clinical priority.\n\n\nCurrent treatment options are either: (a) of marginal efficacy, as is the case for aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; or (b) encumbered by substantive deleterious side effects, as is the case for glucocorticoids and other steroids, for calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine, and for anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies such as infliximab (Remicade™) and TNF receptor decoys such as etanercept (Enbrel™). Given the foregoing, it would be desirable to have improved immunoenhancing agents, for instance for use as vaccine adjuvants, treatments for sepsis, and treatments for immunodeficiency. Further, it would also be desirable to have improved immunosuppressive agents, for instance for use in treating autoimmune diseases, for inducing post-transplant immunosuppression, and for the treatment of other disorders where immunosuppression is desired.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE\n\n\nDisclosed herein is the surprising discovery that TAM (Tyro 3, AxI, and Mer) receptor inhibitors are effective for immunoenhancement and TAM receptor agonists are effective for immunosuppression. Methods are provided for enhancing an immune response in a subject. In some examples, the method includes administering to a subject in need of immunoenhancement a therapeutically effective amount of a TAM receptor inhibitor, thereby enhancing the immune response in the subject. Methods are also provided for screening for an immunoenhancing agent. These methods can include contacting a cell expressing a TAM receptor with a test agent, and determining whether the test agent significantly reduces or inhibits TAM receptor activity.\n\n\nMethods are also provided for suppressing an immune response in a subject. In some examples, the method includes administering to a subject in need of immunosuppression a therapeutically effective amount of a TAM receptor agonist, thereby suppressing the immune response in the subject. Methods are also provided for screening for an immunosuppressive agent. These methods can include contacting a cell expressing a TAM receptor with a test agent, and \n\n determining whether the test agent significantly increases or enhances TAM receptor activity.\n\n\nThe foregoing and other features will become more apparent from the following detailed description of several embodiments, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\nFIG. 1 includes several panels showing hyperactivation of dendritic cells (DCs) in TAM mutant mice and TAM inhibition of TLR-induced cytokine production. FIG. IA shows representative FACS analyses of CDl Ic+ splenocytes from wild-type (WT) and TAM triple knockout (TKO) mice. Cells negative for NKl.1, CD 19, and CD3 were gated for CDl Ic. Numbers inside boxed areas indicate percentage of cells in the gate. FIG. IB shows the same protocol as that shown in FIG. IA independently repeated, and with the data represented as bar graphs. Percentage (left) and total number (right) of CDl lc+ cells in the spleen of WT and Σ4M TKO mice are shown. Error bars: mean ± S. D. (n=6 mice per group, p<0.01). FIG. 1C shows FACS histograms of MHC-I and MHC-II expression on CDl lc+ cells from WT and Σ4M TKO spleens. Results depicted are representative of three independent experiments. FIG. ID shows the relative levels of BAFF mRNA expression in Σ4M TKO CDl lc+ cells acutely isolated from the spleen, normalized to WT, as determined by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). Error bars represent the mean ± S. D. (n=3, p<0.01). FIGS. IE and IF show IL6 and TNFα levels produced by WT, AxT\n1'\n, Mer\n\"\n ' and TAM TKO spleen-derived CDl lc+ cells following 15 hours of stimulation with the indicated TLR agonist, as determined by ELISA. Results depicted are representative of three independent studies. FIG. IG shows Western blots of bone marrow-dendritic cell (BM-DC) cell lysates probed with AxI and tubulin (top blots) and Mer and actin (bottom blots) antibodies. Identical results were obtained with lysates prepared from CDl lc+ cells acutely isolated from spleen. FIGS. IH-I J show the relative production of the indicated cytokines following 15 hours of stimulation of DCs with 10 nM CpG (FIG. IH), 10 ng/ml LPS (FIG. II) or 10 μg/ml Poly LC (FIG. IJ), either alone (-) or concomitantly with (+) 50 nM Gas6. Cytokine production was measured as described below in Example 1. Results were normalized to the \n\n production of the corresponding cytokine in the presence of the TLR ligand alone. Error bars: mean ± S. D (n>3 per group, /KO.01).\n\n\nFIG. 2 includes several panels showing that TAM receptor activation inhibits conserved components of the TLR9 signaling pathway. Whole cell lysates were prepared from bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) activated for the indicated minutes with CpG alone, or after a 2-hour pre-incubation with 50 nM Gas6. FIG. 2A shows Western blots probed for activated, phospho-p38 Thrl80/Tyrl82 (top blot) and total p38 (bottom blot). FIG. 2B shows Western blots probed for activated, phospho-ERK 1/2 Thrl83/Tyrl85 (top blot) and total ERK 1/2 (bottom blot). FIGS. 2C-E show Quantitative Li-Cor Odyssey Western blots probed for IκBα, IκBβ, and tubulin (left), and measured IκBα /tubulin and IκBβ /tubulin signal ratios (right, mean ± S. D.; n=3). DCs were activated as described. In addition, DCs were pretreated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (FIG. 2D), or with 1 μg/ml actinomycin D (FIG. 2E), for 30 minutes prior to the addition of Gasό.\n\n\nFIG. 3 includes several panels showing that TAM activation induces SOCS 1/3 and inhibits TLR4-induced ubiquitylation of TRAF3/6. FIG. 3 A is a bar graph showing the results of activating BM-DCs for the indicated time with 50 nM Gas6, and then assaying for expression of SOCSl and SOCS 3 mRNA by Q-PCR. SOCSl/3 mRNA levels relative to β-actin were normalized to those of unstimulated cells. Error bars: mean ± S.D (n=4 for SOCSl; n=3 for SOCS3). FIG. 3B shows the results of treating the cells as in FIG. 3A, and then assaying for expression of the indicated inhibitor mRNAs by Q-PCR. Error bars represent the mean ± S.D (n=2). In FIG. 3C, BM-DCs were incubated for 0 or 30 minutes with 1 μg/ml LPS alone, or for 30 minutes with LPS after a 2-hour preincubation with 50 nM Gas6. TRAF6 was immunoprecipitated from whole cells lysates, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with ubiquitin (top blot) and TRAF6 (bottom blot) antibodies. In FIG. 3D, cells were treated as in FIG. 3C. TRAF3 was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates and its ubiquitylation was assessed by immunoblotting with ubiquitin (top blot) and TRAF3 (bottom blot) antibodies.\n\n\nFIG. 4 includes several panels showing that IFNAR/STATl signaling is activated by TAM receptor activation, and is required for TAM induction of SOCS genes and inhibition of cytokine production. In FIG. 4A, splenic DCs were \n\n incubated for the indicated time with 50 nM Gas6, and whole cell Iy sates were then analyzed by immunoblotting for activated phospho-STATl Tyr 701 (top blot) and total STATl (bottom blot). In FIG. 4B, BM-DCs were incubated with 50 nM Gas6 alone or after a preincubation of 10 minutes with 100 nM AxI-FC. Whole cell lysates were then analyzed as in FIG. 4 A. In FIGS. 4C and 4D, BM-DCs from WT and STATl knock-out mice were incubated for the indicated time with 50 nM Gas6, and expression of SOCSl (FIG. 4C) and SOCS3 (FIG. 4D) mRNAs was determined by Q-PCR. mRNA levels relative to β-actin expression were normalized to unstimulated cells. Error bars represent the mean ± S. D, n=2. In FIGS. 4E and 4F, BM-DCs from WT and STATl\n'\n'\n'\n mice were stimulated with 10 ng/ml LPS (FIG. 4E) or 3 nM CpG (FIG. 4F), either alone (-) or concomitantly with (+) 50 nM Gas6. After 15 hours, levels of secreted IL-6 were determined by ELISA, whose detection limit is approximately 4 pg/ml. Note the expansion of the y-axis for the STATT \n'\n measurements in FIGS. 4E and 4F. In FIG. 4G, whole cell lysates of BM-DCs from either WT (left) or IFNA receptor knock-outs {IfnarT \n\"\n; right), either untreated (-) or treated with (+) 50 nM Gas6 for 60 minutes, were analyzed by immunoblotting for activated phospho-STATl (top blots) and total STATl (bottom blots). In FIG. 4H, BM-DCs from fFJand IfnarT\n1'\n mice were incubated for the indicated minutes with 50 nM Gas6, and expression of SOCSl mRNA was determined by Q-PCR. mRNA levels relative to β-actin expression were normalized to unstimulated cells. Error bars represent the mean ± S. D, n=2. In FIG. 41, BM-DCs from WT and IfnarT \n'\n mice were stimulated with 10 ng/ml LPS, either alone (-) or concomitantly with (+) 50 nM Gas6. After 15 hours, levels of secreted IL-6 were determined by ELISA. In FIG. 4J, whole cell BM-DC lysates, either untreated (-) or treated for 20 minutes with 50 nM Gas6 (+), were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to the Rl (left blots) or R2 (right blots) chain of the type I IFN receptor. These immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS gels, which were then immunoblotted with antibodies against AxI (top blots), the IFN receptor Rl chain (middle left blot), the IFN receptor R2 chain (middle right blot), or STATl (bottom blots). An equivalent association of AxI with the Rl chain of the IFN receptor was also observed in IPs of AxI blotted with anti-IFNARl. FIG. 5 includes several panels showing that TLR induction of TAM signaling is activated in an IFNAR/STATl -dependent fashion. In FIG. 5 A, BM- DCs were incubated for the indicated hours with 30 μg/ml Poly LC or 100 ng/ml \n\n LPS and expression of AxI mRNA was then determined by Q-PCR. mRNA levels relative to β-actin expression were normalized to unstimulated cells. Error bars represent the mean ± S. D (n=2). FIG. 5B shows representative FACS histograms of AxI expression on unstimulated WT CDl Ic\n+\n cells, CDl Ic\n+\n cells stimulated with 30 μg/ml Poly LC for 12 hours or in a TAMTKO control. In FIGS. 5C - 5E, BM- DCs - prepared from wild-type, STATl'., and IFNAR\n'A\n mice - were incubated for the indicated hours with 30 μg/ml Poly LC (FIGS. 5C, 5E) or 3000 U/ml IFNα (FIG. 5D) and whole cell lysates were then analyzed by immunoblotting for AxI (top blots) and tubulin expression (bottoms blots). Wild-type controls are from strain 129 mice for FIGS. 5C and 5D, and from C57B1/6 for FIG. 5E.\n\n\nFIG. 6 includes several panels showing integration of TAM and IFN receptor signaling. In FIG. 6 A, splenic CDl Ic\n+\n cells from WT and TAM TKO mice were incubated for the indicated hours with 300 U/ml IFNα and expression of SOCSl mRNA was then determined by Q-PCR. mRNA levels relative to β-actin were normalized to unstimulated cells. Error bars represent the mean ± S. D (n=4). In FIGS. 6B and 6C, the same mRNA samples used in FIG. 6 A were analyzed for expression oϊIRF-7 mRNA (FIG. 6B) and IFI-204 mRNA (FIG. 6C) by Q-PCR. mRNA levels relative to β-actin were normalized to unstimulated cells. Error bars represent the mean ± S. D (n=4). In FIG. 6D, RNA samples prepared from BM- DCs that were incubated for 2 hours with 50 nM Gas6, 30 U/ml IFNα, or Gas6 plus IFNα together were analyzed for expression SOCSl mRNA (left), IRF -7 mRNA (middle), and IFI-204 mRNA (right) by Q-PCR. mRNA levels relative to β-actin were normalized to unstimulated cells.\n\n\nFIG. 7 includes several panels showing a cycle of inflammation and inhibition, regulated by TAM receptor signaling. FIG. 7A is a schematic representation of the sequential engagement of TLR, cytokine receptor, and TAM receptor signaling pathways in DCs. FIG. 7B is a schematic representation of the inflammatory cycle initiated by TLR ligation. Activation of TLRs leads to an initial burst of cytokines. This burst is then amplified in a second stage, via a feed- forward loop through cytokine receptors. At the same time, activation of cytokine receptors leads to an IFNAR/STATl -dependent induction of AxI. The final stage of the inflammatory cycle involves the engagement of TAM signaling, the transcription of SOCS genes, and the pleiotropic inhibition of both cytokine receptor and TLR signaling pathways. This final TAM-driven inhibitory phase of \n\n the cycle is also dependent on the IFNAR/STAT1 signaling cassette, which is physically associated with TAM receptors.\n\n\nFIG. 8 includes several panels showing that TAM receptor activation by Protein S inhibits cytokine production and conserved components of the TLR9 signaling pathway. FIG. 8 A shows a quantitative representation of the relative production of IFNα from DCs following 15 hours of stimulation with 10 nM CpG alone (-) or concomitantly with (+) 3 nM Pro S. Cytokine production was measured as described in detail in Example 1. The results were normalized to the production of IFNα in the presence of CpG alone. Error bars represent the mean ± S. D (n=3 p, p<0.01). FIG. 8B shows Western blot analyses of the expression of phospho-p38 Thrl80/Tyrl82 (top blot), phospho-ERK 1/2 Thrl83/Tyrl85 (middle blot) and tubulin (lower blot) in whole cell lysates from BM-DCs activated for the indicated minutes with CpG alone or after a 2-hour pre-incubation with Pro S. FIG. 8C shows quantitative Li-Cor Odyssey Western blot analyses of the expression of IκBα (top blot), IκBβ (middle blot) and tubulin (lower blot) in whole cell lysates as described in FIG. 8B.

FIG. 9A shows Western blot analyses of the expression of phospho-p38 Thrl80/Thrl82 (top blot) and total p38 (bottom blot) in whole cell lysates from BM-DCs activated for the indicated minutes with Poly LC alone or after a 2-hour pre-incubation with Gas6. FIG. 9B shows quantitative Li-Cor Odyssey Western blot analyses of the expression of IκBα and tubulin, in whole cell lysates prepared as described in FIG. 9A. The bar graph on the right shows IκBα/tubulin signal ratios at the indicated time. (Error bars represent the mean ± S. D.; n=3). FIGS. 9C and 9D show Western blot analyses of the expression of phospho-p38 Thrl80/Thrl82 (top blot) and total p38 (bottom blot; FIG. 9C), and of phospho-ERKl/2 Thrl83/Tyrl85 (top blot) and total ERK 2 (bottom blot; FIG. 9D) in whole cell lysates from BM-DCs, activated for the indicated time with LPS alone or after a 2-hour pre-incubation with Gas6. FIG. 10 includes several panels showing that TAM receptor inhibition of receptor proximal points in TLR signaling pathways requires STATl, but does not activate STAT2 or STAT3. In FIG. 1OA, BM-DCs prepared from wild-type (left \n\n blots) or Σ4M TKO mice (right blots) were incubated without (-) or with (+) 50 nM Gas6 for 60 minutes, and lysates of these cells were then analyzed by immunoblotting for expression of phospo-STATl (upper blots) and total STATl (lower blots). In FIG. 1OB, splenic DCs were incubated for the indicated time with 50 nM Gas6, and whole cell lysates were then analyzed by immunoblotting for phospho-STAT2 (top blot), total STAT2 (second blot), phospho-STAT3 (third blot), and total STAT3 (bottom blot). In FIG. 1OC, BM-DCs prepared from either STATF \n'\n (left blot) or TAM TKO mice (right blot) were incubated for 30 minutes with 1 μg/ml LPS alone, or for 30 minutes with LPS after a 2-hour preincubation with 50 nM Gas6. TRAF6 was immunoprecipitated from whole cells lysates, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with ubiquitin (top blots) and TRAF6 (bottom blots) antibodies. In FIG. 10D, whole cell lysates, prepared from either wild-type (left blots) or STATl'\n'\n (right blots) BM-DCs and activated for the indicated minutes with LPS alone, or after a 2-hour pre-incubation with 50 nM Gas6, were analyzed by Li-Cor Odyssey Western blots probed for IκBα (top blots) and tubulin (bottom blots).\n\n\nFIG. 11 is a bar graph showing TAM triple mutant mice (Tyro3\n\"\n AXL\n\" \"\n Mer\n\" \"\n) produce approximately 3.5-fold higher antibody titers at 2 weeks than wild- type (WT) mice following immunization.

Overview of several embodiments Disclosed herein are methods that take advantage of the surprising discovery that TAM (Tyro 3, AxI, and Mer) receptor inhibitors are effective for immunoenhancement. In one embodiment, methods are provided for enhancing an immune response in a subject. The method can include administering to a subject in need of immunoenhancement a therapeutically effective amount of a TAM receptor inhibitor, thereby enhancing the immune response in the subject. In certain examples of the method, the TAM receptor is Tyro3, AxI, or Mer. In particular examples, the TAM receptor inhibitor substantially or completely reduces the biological activity of the receptor, such as a reduction of at least 25%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 90%, or at least 95%. In certain examples, \n\n TAM receptor inhibitors (such as a small molecule inhibitor) bind to an intracellular domain of Tyro3, AxI, or Mer, such as an ATP binding site. In other examples, the TAM receptor inhibitor binds to an extracellular domain of the TAM receptor. In such examples, the inhibitor may interfere with binding of a TAM receptor ligand to the receptor or otherwise prevent complete activation of the receptor. Similarly, a TAM receptor inhibitor may bind to a TAM receptor ligand, such as Gas6 or Protein S, and thereby interfere with the binding of the ligand to the extracellular domain of the TAM receptor and/or activation of the TAM receptor. In yet other examples, a TAM receptor inhibitor is one that decreases or inhibits expression of a TAM receptor or ligand thereof (e.g., RNAi molecules). Exemplary TAM receptor inhibitors include small molecule inhibitors, antibodies, and siRNA. In yet more particular examples, the TAM inhibitor is MP470, SGI- AXL-277, AXL-I, AXL-2, AXL-3, AXL-4, AXL-5, AXL-6, AXL-7, AXL-8, or AXL-9 or derivatives thereof. In certain examples, the TAM receptor inhibitor has an IC50 of less than about 50 μM, and in even more particular examples, the TAM receptor inhibitor has an IC50 of from about 1 pM to about 5 μM.\n\n\nSome embodiments of the disclosed immunoenhancement methods also include administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a vaccine, thereby enhancing the immune response to the vaccine. In some examples, the TAM receptor inhibitor is administered to the subject substantially concurrently with the vaccine, and in particular examples, the vaccine includes dendritic cells (DCs) activated against a tumor in the subject.\n\n\nOther embodiments of the disclosed immunoenhancement methods are methods of treating a tumor in a subject, methods of treating a disease of immunosuppression, and methods of treating sepsis, for instance, septic shock, severe inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or severe SIRS. In some examples, the method is a method of treating an infection in a subject in need thereof, and in particular examples, the subject is immunocompromised or immunosuppressed. Also disclosed herein is the surprising discovery that TAM receptor agonists are useful for immunosuppression, for example, for the treatment or prevention of autoimmune diseases, allergies, graft-versus-host disease or transplant rejection. One embodiment of the disclosure is a method of suppressing an immune response in a subject. The method includes administering to a subject \n\n in need of immunosuppression a therapeutically effective amount of a TAM receptor agonist, thereby suppressing the immune response in the subject. In particular examples, the TAM receptor agonist substantially increases the biological activity of the receptor, such as an increase of at least 25%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 90%, at least 100%, or at least 200%. In certain examples, the TAM receptor is Tyro3, AxI, or Mer. Exemplary TAM receptor agonists include TAM ligands, such as GAS6 and Protein S, as well as an amino-terminally truncated forms of GAS 6 and Protein S, such as those that do not have a GIa or EGF domain or have a partial GIa or EGF domain. Other exemplary TAM receptor agonists include those agents that can specifically bind to an extracellular domain of the TAM receptor and activate the receptor, for example by cross- linking the receptor into a TAM receptor dimer. In certain examples, the TAM agonist has an EC50 of less than about 50 μM, for instance, from about 1 pM to about 5 μM. Other examples of the disclosed immunosuppression methods further include administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of an additional immunosuppressive agent, thereby suppressing the immune response in the subject. In some examples, the TAM receptor agonist is administered to the subject substantially concurrently with the immunosuppressive agent. In certain examples, the subject is immunocompromised.\n\n\nCertain embodiments of the disclosed immunosuppression methods are methods of treating an autoimmune disease in a subject, a method of treating an allergy, a method of treating graft-versus-host disease or a method of treating or preventing a transplant rejection. In some examples, the autoimmune disease is rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, pernicious anemia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, renal fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis, Addison's disease, type I diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, Sjogren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, Reiter's syndrome, or Grave's disease. In still other examples, the method is a method of treating graft-versus-host disease in a subject in need thereof or a method of treating transplant rejection in a subject at risk of rejecting a transplant. Also disclosed are methods of screening for an immunomodulator. Some examples of the method include contacting a cell expressing a TAM receptor with a test agent; and determining whether the test agent alters TAM receptor activity or \n\n the test agent inhibits binding of a ligand to the TAM receptor. Test agents that increase TAM receptor activity or enhance binding of a ligand to the TAM receptor are identified as immunosuppressive agents and wherein test agents that inhibit TAM receptor activity or reduce or inhibit binding of a ligand to the TAM receptor are identified as immunoenhancing agents. In certain examples, the TAM receptor is Tyro3, AxI, or Mer. In some examples, the method can include selecting a test agent indicated to be an immunoenhancing agent or an immunosuppressive agent for further analysis. In particular examples, the cell is in a laboratory mammal, and contacting the cell with the test agent includes administering the test agent to the mammal.\n\n\nIn some examples, the method is a method of screening for an immunoenhancing agent and determining whether the test agent significantly reduces or inhibits TAM receptor activity. The method can include contacting the cell with the test agent and determining whether the test agent: i. alters TAM autophosphorylation as compared to a control (such as a cell not contacted with the test agent), wherein a significant reduction in TAM autophosphorylation in the presence of the test agent relative to the control indicates that the test agent significantly reduces or inhibits TAM receptor activity; ii. alters TLR-induced cytokine production as compared to a control; wherein an increase in TLR- induced cytokine production in the presence of the test agent relative to the control indicates that the test agent inhibits TAM receptor activity; iii. alters TLR-induced stimulation of MAP kinase activation as compared to a control (such as a cell not contacted with the test agent), wherein an increase in TLR-induced stimulation of MAP kinase activation in the presence of the test agent relative to the control indicates that the test agent significantly reduces or inhibits TAM receptor activity; and/or iv. alters TLR-induced NF-kB activation as compared to a control (such as a cell not contacted with the test agent); wherein an increase in TLR-induced NF-kB activation in the presence of the test agent relative to the control indicates that the test agent significantly reduces or inhibits TAM receptor activity. In some examples, the control is a value obtained for a cell not contacted with the test agent or is a reference value (or range of values) expected when TAM receptor activity is increased, decreased, or unchanged.\n\n\nIn still other examples, the method is a method of screening for an immunosuppressive agent and determining whether the test agent increases TAM \n\n receptor activity. The method can include contacting the cell with the test agent and determining whether the test agent: i. alters TAM autophosphorylation as compared to a control level of TAM autophosphorylation, wherein an increase in TAM autophosphorylation in the presence of the test agent relative to a control indicates that the test agent increases TAM receptor activity; ii. alters TLR-induced cytokine production as compared to a control, wherein a decrease in TLR-induced cytokine production in the presence of the test agent relative to a control indicates that the test agent increases TAM receptor activity; iii. alters TLR-induced stimulation of MAP kinase activation as compared to a control, wherein decrease in TLR-induced stimulation of MAP kinase activation in the presence of the test agent relative to a control indicates that the test agent increases TAM receptor activity; and/or iv. alters TLR-induced NF-kB activation as compared to a control, wherein a decrease in TLR-induced NF-kB activation in the presence of the test agent relative to the control indicates that the test agent increases TAM receptor activity. In some examples, the control is a value obtained for a cell not contacted with the test agent or is a reference value (or range of values) expected when TAM receptor activity is increased, decreased, or unchanged.\n\n\nIn still further examples, the method can include determining if the test agent alters TAM receptor activity by (a) determining a control level of SOCSl and SOCS 3 expression before contacting the cell with the test agent; (b) contacting the cell with the test agent; and (c) determining whether contacting the cell with the test agent alters SOCSl and SOCS 3 expression as compared to the control level of SOCSl and SOCS 3 expression. A reduction in SOCSl and SOCS 3 expression in the presence of the test agent relative to the control level indicates that the test agent inhibits TAM receptor activity and such test agents are identified as immunoenhancing agents. An increase in SOCSl and SOCS 3 expression in the presence of the test agent relative to the control level indicates that the test agent increases TAM receptor activity and such test agents are identified as immunosuppressive agents. In certain examples, the method is a method of screening for an immunosuppressive agent and contacting the cell expressing the TAM receptor with the test agent includes contacting the cell with the test agent in the presence of a TAM receptor agonist. For example, a TAM receptor agonist, such as a TAM receptor ligand (e.g., Gas6 or Protein S), amino-terminally-truncated ligands (e.g., \n\n Gas6 or Protein S not having a full or only a partial GIa or EGF domain), or an antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of the TAM receptor and crosslinks and activates the TAM receptor in a TAM receptor dimer can be used.\n\n\n//.

Terms\n\n\nIn order to facilitate review of the various embodiments of the disclosure, the following explanations of specific terms are provided:\n\n\nAdjuvant: A vehicle or component of a vehicle used to enhance antigenicity, for example in a subject to whom it is administered. Specific, non- limiting examples of adjuvants include a suspension of minerals (e.g., alum, aluminum hydroxide, or phosphate) on which antigen is adsorbed; a water-in-oil emulsion in which antigen solution is emulsified in mineral oil (for instance, Freund's incomplete adjuvant), sometimes with the inclusion of killed mycobacteria (for instance, Freund's complete adjuvant) to further enhance antigenicity (substantially reduces or inhibits degradation of antigen and/or causes influx of macrophages); and immunstimulatory oligonucleotides, such as those including a CpG motif (for example see U.S. Patent No. 6, 194,388; U.S. Patent No. 6,207,646; U.S. Patent No. 6,214,806; U.S. Patent No. 6,218,371; U.S. Patent No. 6,239, 116; U.S. Patent No. 6,339,068; U.S. Patent No. 6,406,705; and U.S. Patent No. 6,429, 199). Other non-limiting examples of adjuvants include keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), Interleukin - 2 (IL-2),\n\n\nGranulocyte Monocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), QS21, Montanide ISA-51, and, as described herein, TAM receptor inhibitors.\n\n\nAdministration: Includes both oral and parenteral administration, as well as vaginal and rectal administration. Generally, parenteral formulations are those that are administered through any possible mode except ingestion. This term also refers to injections, whether administered intravenously, intrathecally, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, intra-articularly, or subcutaneously, and various surface applications including intranasal, inhalational, intradermal, and topical application, for instance. Allergy: A collection of symptoms caused by an exaggerated immune response or reaction to substances that do not trigger an immune response in most people, and thus is an example of an immune-mediated disorder. The term \"allergy\" has become synonymous with Type I hypersensitivity (IgE-mediated allergy). Four different types of hypersensitivity were described by Coomb and \n\n GeIl (Types I, II, III and IV), as a pedagogical way to increase the understanding of different immune reactions which could be provoked by many antigens. In practice, these types do not necessarily occur in isolation from each other.\n\n\nAllergic diseases generally begin in childhood, although they can arise at any age. Development of allergic disease is associated with an allergic constitution due to heredity and to environmental and health factors. An allergic response involves an increased production of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, which may lead to clinical symptoms such as rhinitis, asthma, eczema, colic pains, or diarrhea. A state of hyperreactivity often accompanies an allergic reaction. If this hyperreactivity occurs in the respiratory tract, everyday stimuli like dust, tobacco smoke, cold air and perfumes may lead to allergy-like symptoms.\n\n\nAnti-infectious agent: A substance (such as a chemical compound, protein, antisense or RNAi oligonucleotide, or other molecule) of use in treating infection of a subject. Anti-infectious agents include, but are not limited to, anti- fungal compounds, anti-viral compounds, and antibiotics. Antibiotics include, but are not limited to, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, cefuroxime, cephalexin ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, metronidazole, terbinafine, levofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, tetracycline, and azithromycin. Anti-fungal compounds include, but are not limited to, clotrimazole, butenafine, butoconazole, ciclopirox, clioquinol, clioquinol, clotrimazole, econazole, fluconazole, flucytosine, griseofulvin, haloprogin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, naftifine, nystatin, oxiconazole, sulconazole, terbinafine, terconazole, tioconazole, and tolnaftate. Anti-viral compounds include, but are not limited to, zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, abacavir, tenofovir, nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, amprenavir, and lopinavir. Anti-infectious agents also include hyper-immune globulin. Hyperimmune globulin is gamma globulin isolated from a donor, or from a pool of donors, that have been immunized with a substance of interest. Specifically, hyper-immune globulin is antibody purified from a donor who was repeatedly vaccinated against a pathogen.\n\n\nArthritis: An inflammatory disease that affects the synovial membranes of one or more joints in the body. It is the most common type of joint disease, and it is characterized by the inflammation of the joint. The disease is usually oligoarticular (affects few joints), but may be generalized. The joints commonly \n\n involved include the hips, knees, lower lumbar and cervical vertebrae, proximal and distal interphangeal joints of the fingers, first carpometacarpal joints, and first tarsometatarsal joints of the feet.\n\n\nOne type of arthritis is reactive arthritis, which is an acute nonpurulent arthritis secondary to a urinary tract or gastrointestinal infection with a variety of microorganisms, including Chlamydia trachomatis, Yersinia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter. Microbial components are found in the affected joints. The arthritis appears abruptly and tends to involve the knees and ankles, but sometimes involves the wrists, fingers, and/or toes. Untreated, the arthritis lasts for about a year, then generally abates and only rarely is accompanied by ankylosing spondylitis. Despite evidence of disease being triggered by bacterial infection, viable bacteria are rarely present in affected joints and antibiotic treatment seldom provides relief.\n\n\nAnother type of arthritis is rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease that affects the synovial membranes of multiple joints in the body. Because the disease is systemic, there are many extraarticular features of the disease as well. For example, neuropathy, scleritis, lymphadenopathy, pericarditis, splenomegaly, arteritis, and rheumatoid nodules are frequent components of the disease. In most cases of rheumatoid arthritis, the subject has remissions and exacerbations of the symptoms. Rheumatoid arthritis considered an autoimmune disease that is acquired and in which genetic factors appear to play a role.\n\n\nAutoimmune disorder: A disorder in which the immune system produces an immune response (for instance, a B cell or a T cell response) against an endogenous antigen, with consequent injury to tissues. For example, rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder, as are Hashimoto's thyroiditis, pernicious anemia, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), psoriasis, renal, pulmonary, and hepatic fibroses, Addison's disease, type I diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, Sjogren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, Reiter's syndrome, and Grave's disease, among others.\n\n\nBioterrorism agents: Any pathogen (such as bacteria and viruses) or toxin that can be dispersed deliberately to cause disease or death to humans or animals. Examples of bioterrorism agents include Bacillus anthracis, which causes anthrax, \n\n Yersinia pestis, which causes plague, and Variola major, which causes smallpox, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), which causes tick-borne encephalitis, and Ebola virus, which causes Ebola. Bioterrorism agents also include biotoxins, which are toxins produced by certain biological organisms. Exemplary biotoxins are botulinum toxin, produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, and ricin, which can be isolated from castor oil seeds. Western counter-proliferation agencies currently recognize 23 types of bacteria, 43 types of viruses, and 14 types of biotoxins as potential bioterrorism agents.\n\n\nOther examples of bioterrorism agents include, but are not limited to, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, cobra venom, shellfish toxin, botulinum toxin, saxitoxin, ricin toxin, Shigella flexneri, S. dysenteriae {Shigella bacillus), Salmonella, Staphylococcus enterotoxin B, Histoplasma capsulatum, tricothecene mycotoxin, aflatoxin. Bioterrorism agents can also result in cryptococcosis, brucellosis (undulant fever), coccidioidomycosis (San Joaquin Valley or desert fever), psittacosis (parrot fever), bubonic plague, tularemia (rabbit fever), malaria, cholera, typhoid, hemorrhagic fever, tick-borne encephalitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, pneumonic plague, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, dengue fever, Rift Valley fever, diphtheria, melioidosis, glanders, tuberculosis, infectious hepatitis, encephalitides, blastomycosis, nocardiosis, yellow fever, typhus, and Q fever. Cancer: A malignant neoplasm that has undergone characteristic anaplasia with loss of differentiation, increase rate of growth, invasion of surrounding tissue, and that is capable of metastasis. For example, thyroid cancer is a malignant neoplasm that arises in or from thyroid tissue, and breast cancer is a malignant neoplasm that arises in or from breast tissue (such as a ductal carcinoma). Residual cancer is cancer that remains in a subject after any form of treatment given to the subject to reduce or eradicate thyroid cancer. Metastatic cancer is a cancer at one or more sites in the body other than the site of origin of the original (primary) cancer from which the metastatic cancer is derived.\n\n\nChemotherapy; chemotherapeutic agents: As used herein, includes agents with therapeutic usefulness in the treatment of diseases characterized by abnormal cell growth {e.g., an anti-neoplastic agent). Such diseases include tumors, neoplasms, and cancer, as well as diseases characterized by hyperplastic growth such as psoriasis. In one embodiment, a chemotherapeutic agent is an agent of use in treating neoplasms such as solid tumors. In one embodiment, a \n\n chemotherapeutic agent is radioactive molecule. One of skill in the art can readily identify a chemotherapeutic agent (for instance, see Slapak and Kufe, Principles of Cancer Therapy, Chapter 86 in Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 14th edition; Perry et al., Chemotherapy, Ch. 17 in Abeloff, Clinical Oncology 2\nnd\n ed., © 2000 Churchill Livingstone, Inc; Baltzer L, Berkery R (eds): Oncology Pocket Guide to Chemotherapy, 2nd ed. St. Louis, Mosby-Year Book, 1995; Fischer DS, Knobf MF, Durivage HJ (eds): The Cancer Chemotherapy Handbook, 4th ed. St. Louis, Mosby-Year Book, 1993).\n\n\nControl: A reference standard. In some examples, a control can be a known value (or range of values) indicative of activity of a molecule, such as TAM receptor activity or TAM ligand binding activity, in a sample not treated with a test agent. A difference between a test sample and a control can be an increase or conversely a decrease. The difference can be a qualitative difference or a quantitative difference, for example a statistically significant difference. In some examples, a difference is an increase or decrease, relative to a control, of at least about 10%, such as at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 100%, at least about 150%, at least about 200%, at least about 250%, at least about 300%, at least about 350%, at least about 400%, at least about 500%, or greater then 500%.\n\n\nIn some examples, the amount of phosphorylated protein and/or unphosphorylated protein detected can be compared to a control. In several embodiments, the control is a known value indicative of the amount of phosphorylated protein, such as TAM receptor phosphorylation, formed from basal phosphorylation of the protein {e.g., TAM receptor). In other embodiments, the control is a value indicative of the amount of activity, such as phosphorylation or biological activity, in the presence of a known amount of TAM receptor ligand. In still other embodiments, the control is the amount of phosphorylated peptide formed in a sample not contacted with the test agent. One of skill in the art will understand that the amount of unphosphorylated peptide can be determined from the difference between the total amount of peptide used and the amount of phosphorylated peptide detected. A difference between the amount of activity in the presence of a test agent relative to a control can indicate that the test agent can \n\n be of use as a TAM receptor inhibitor (such as for immunoenhancement) or a TAM receptor agonist (such as for immunosuppression).\n\n\nDendritic cell (DC): The principal antigen presenting cell (APC) involved in primary immune responses. Dendritic cells include plasmacytoid dendritic cells and conventional dendritic cells. Their major function is to obtain antigen in tissues, migrate to lymphoid organs and present the antigen in order to activate T cells. Immature dendritic cells originate in the bone marrow and reside in the periphery as immature cells.\n\n\nEC50: A measure of concentration used in pharmacology. EC50 (the half maximal effective concentration) refers to the concentration of an agent (such as a ligand or antibody) which induces a response halfway between the baseline and maximum. It is commonly used as a measure of drug potency. The ECso of a graded dose response curve therefore represents the concentration of a compound where 50% of its maximal effect is observed. The EC50 of a quantal dose response curve represents the concentration of a compound where 50% of the population exhibit a response.\n\n\nGraft-versus-host disease: Tissue rejection, also called graft-versus-host disease, is a consequence of organ or tissue transplantation caused by the transplant recipient's (host's) immune response to the transplanted organ/tissue which can damage or destroy it. Ordinarily, the immune response protects the body from potentially harmful substances (antigens) such as microorganisms, toxins, and cancer cells. The immune system distinguishes \"self from \"foreign\" by reacting to proteins on the surfaces of cells. It reacts against substances it recognizes as foreign (antigens). The presence of foreign blood or tissue in the body triggers an immune response that can result in blood transfusion reactions and transplant rejection when antibodies are formed against foreign antigens on the transplanted or transfused material.\n\n\nHIV (human immunodeficiency virus): A retrovirus that causes immunosuppression in humans (HIV disease) and leads to a disease complex known as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). \"HIV disease\" refers to a well-recognized constellation of signs and symptoms (including the development of opportunistic infections) in persons who are infected by an HIV virus (such as HIV-I or HIV-2), for example as determined by antibody or \n\n Western blot studies. Laboratory findings associated with this disease include a progressive decline in T-helper cells.\n\n\nIC50: A measure of concentration used in pharmacology. IC\n50\n, or the half maximal inhibitory concentration, represents the concentration of an inhibitor that is required for 50% inhibition of its target (for instance, an enzyme, a cell, a receptor, or a microorganism). Generally, an IC50 value is a measure of how much of a particular composition is needed to inhibit some biological process by 50%. IC50 is commonly used as a measure of drug affinity, and represents the concentration of a composition that is required to obtain 50% of the maximum effect in vivo.\n\n\nImmune-mediated disorder: A disorder that involves an unwanted immune response. Although immune recognition of \"non-self ' proteins is essential to avoid and eliminate infection, the immune response can sometimes be unwanted. Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, are the result of a pathological immune response against self antigens, and T cells are the primary mediators of autoimmunity.\n\n\nRejection of transplanted organs and tissues is a further example of an immune-mediated disorder, and can often result in damage to and/or rejection of the transplant. Tissue rejection, also called graft-versus-host disease, is a consequence of organ or tissue transplantation caused by the transplant recipient's (host's) immune response to the transplanted organ/tissue which can damage or destroy it. No two people (except identical twins) have identical tissue antigens. Therefore, in the absence of immunosuppressive drugs, organ and tissue transplantation would almost always causes an immune response against the foreign tissue (rejection), which would result in destruction of the transplant. Though tissue typing ensures that the organ or tissue is as similar as possible to the tissues of the recipient, unless the donor is an identical twin, no match is perfect and the possibility of organ/tissue rejection remains. Immunosuppressive therapy is used to prevent organ rejection. Allergy is another example of an immune- mediated disorder.\n\n\nImmune response: A response of a cell of the immune system, such as a B cell or T cell, to a stimulus. In one embodiment, the response is specific for a particular antigen (an \"antigen-specific response\"). A \"parameter of an immune \n\n response\" is any particular measurable aspect of an immune response, including, but not limited to, cytokine secretion (IL-6, IL-IO, IFN-α, etc.), immunoglobulin production, dendritic cell maturation, and proliferation of a cell of the immune system. \"Enhancing an immune response\" includes the use of any composition or method that results in an increase in any of these parameters. One of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine an increase in any one of these parameters using known laboratory assays. In one specific non-limiting example, incorporation of \n3\nH-thymidine can be measured to assess cell proliferation. A \"substantial\" increase in a parameter of the immune response is a significant increase in this parameter as compared to a control. Specific, non-limiting examples of a substantial increase are at least about a 50% increase, at least about a 75% increase, at least about a 90% increase, at least about a 100% increase, at least about a 200% increase, at least about a 300% increase, and at least about a 500% increase. One of ordinary skill in the art can readily identify a significant increase using known statistical methods. One, specific, non-limiting example of a statistical test used to assess a substantial increase is the use of a Z test to compare the percent of samples that respond to a vaccine alone as compared to the percent of samples that respond using a vaccine administered in conjunction with a TAM receptor inhibitor. A non-parametric ANOVA can be used to compare differences in the magnitude of the response induced by vaccine alone as compared to the percent of samples that respond using vaccine administered in conjunction with a TAM receptor inhibitor. In this example, p <β.05 is significant, and indicates a substantial increase in the parameter of the immune response. One of skill in the art can readily identify other statistical assays of use.\n\n\nAn \"immunoprotective response\" is an immune response that results in a decrease of symptoms upon infection or results in a delay, amelioration, or prevention of a disease associated with infection. \"Enhancing the immunogenicity of a vaccine\" is an example of an increase in an immune response. \"Inhibiting an immune response\" includes the use of any composition or method that results in a decrease in any of these parameters. One of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine a decrease in any one of these parameters using known laboratory assays. In one specific non-limiting example, incorporation of \n\n \n3\nH-thymidine can be measured to assess cell proliferation. A \"substantial\" decrease in a parameter of the immune response is a significant decrease in this parameter as compared to a control. Specific, non-limiting examples of a substantial decrease are at least about a 5% decrease, at least about a 10% decrease, at least about a 20% decrease, at least about a 30% decrease, at least about a 40% decrease, at least about a 50% decrease, at least about a 60% decrease, at least about a 70% decrease, at least about a 80% decrease, and at least about a 90% decrease.\n\n\nOne of skill in the art can readily identify a significant decrease using known statistical methods. One, specific, non-limiting example of a statistical test used to assess a substantial decrease is the use of a Z test to compare the percent of samples that respond to a TAM receptor agonist as compared to the percent of samples that respond in the absence TAM receptor agonist. For example, a response could be the level of one or more circulating inflammatory cytokines in subjects that receive or do not receive the TAM receptor agonist. A non- parametric ANOVA can be used to compare differences in the magnitude of the response induced by a TAM receptor agonist as compared to the percent of samples that respond using no TAM receptor agonist. In this example, p ^0.05 is significant, and indicates a substantial decrease in the parameter of the immune response. One of skill in the art can readily identify other statistical assays of use.\n\n\nAssays for immunosuppression will vary as a function of the disease application of interest. For some applications, such as potential treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the serum levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines will be measured using routine methods, such as ELISA or other immunoassay. These inflammatory cytokines include tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and type I interferons (IFNs), such as IFNα and IFNβ. For example, a significant decrease in circulating levels of one or more of these inflammatory cytokines as measured by ELISA or other immunoassays following treatment with a TAM receptor activator indicates a successful immunosuppression treatment. For example, the circulating levels of one or more TNFα, IFNα and IFNβ can be measured prior to and following administration of the TAM receptor activator. The circulating levels can then be compared to determine if immunosuppression has occurred. In other examples, the level of these cytokines following treatment with a TAM receptor activator can be \n\n compared to a reference value (such as a value that has been previously determined to be present in a subject in need of immunosuppression).\n\n\nImmune system deficiency: A disease or disorder in which the subject's immune system is not functioning in normal capacity or in which it would be useful to enhance a subject's immune response. Immune system deficiencies include those diseases or disorders in which the immune system is not functioning at normal capacity, or in which it would be useful to enhance the immune system response.\n\n\nImmunocompromised: An immunocompromised subject is a subject who is incapable of developing or unlikely to develop a robust immune response, usually as a result of disease (such as infection), malnutrition, or immunosuppressive therapy. An immunocompromised immune system is an immune system that is functioning below normal levels. Immunocompromised subjects are more susceptible to opportunistic infections, for example viral, fungal, protozoan, or bacterial infections, and certain neoplasms. Those who can be considered to be immunocompromised include, but are not limited to, subjects with AIDS (or HIV positive), subjects with severe combined immune deficiency (SCID), diabetics, subjects who have had transplants and who are taking immunosuppressives, and those who are receiving chemotherapy for cancer. The term \"immunocompromised individuals\" also includes subjects with most forms of cancer (other than skin cancer), sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, those who do not have a spleen, subjects with end stage kidney disease (dialysis), and those who have been taking corticosteroids on a frequent basis by pill or injection within the last year. Subjects with severe liver, lung, or heart disease also can be immunocompromised.\n\n\nImmunomodulator: A molecule, such as a chemical compound, small molecule, steroid, nucleic acid molecule, or other biological agent, that can modulate an immune response. In some examples, an immunomodulator increases an immune response and has immunoenhancing activity. In additional examples, an immunomodulator decreases or suppresses an immune response and has immunosuppressant activity. Specific, non-limiting examples of immunomodulator are molecules that either decrease or increase an immune response by at least about a 10%, at least about a 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70% decrease, at \n\n least about 80%, or at least about 90%, for example relative to a control in the absence of the immuno modulator.\n\n\nImmunosuppressive agent: A molecule, such as a chemical compound, small molecule, steroid, nucleic acid molecule, or other biological agent, that can decrease an immune response such as an inflammatory reaction. Specific, non- limiting examples of immunosuppressive agents are non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents, cyclosporine A, FK506, and anti-CD4. In additional examples, the agent is a biological response modifier, such as Kineret® (anakinra), Enbrel® (etanercept), or Remicade® (infliximab), a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), such as Arava® (leflunomide), a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAIDs), specifically a Cyclo-Oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, such as Celebrex® (celecoxib) and Vioxx® (rofecoxib), or another product, such as Hyalgan® (hyaluronan) and Synvisc® (hylan G-F20).\n\n\nInfectious agent: An agent that can infect a subject, including, but not limited to, viruses, bacteria, and fungi.\n\n\nExamples of infectious viruses include, but are not limited to, enveloped viruses such as members of the following viral families: Retroviridae {e.g., HIV (such as HIVl and HIV2), MLV, SIV, FIV, Human T-cell leukemia viruses 1 and 2, XMRV, and Coltiviruses (such as CTFV or Banna virus)); Togaviridae (for example, alphaviruses (such as Ross River virus, Sindbis virus, Semliki Forest\n\n\nVirus, O'nyong'nyong virus, Chikungunya virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus) or rubella viruses); Flaviridae (for example, dengue viruses, encephalitis viruses (such as West Nile virus or Japanese encephalitis virus), yellow fever viruses); Coronaviridae (for example, coronaviruses such as SARS virus or Toroviruses); Rhabdoviridae (for example, vesicular stomatitis viruses, rabies viruses); Paramyxoviridae (for example, parainfluenza viruses, mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, sendai virus, and metopneumo virus); Orthomyxoviridae (for example, influenza viruses); Bunyaviridae (for example, Hantaan virus, bunya viruses (such as La Crosse virus), phleboviruses, and Nairo viruses);\n\n\nHepadnaviridae (Hepatitis B viruses); Herpesviridae (herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and HSV-2, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), HHV-8, HHV-6, HHV-7, and pseudorabies virus); Filoviridae (filoviruses including Ebola virus and \n\n Marburg virus) and Poxviridae (variola viruses, vaccinia viruses, pox viruses (such as small pox, monkey pox, and Molluscum contagiosum virus), yatabox virus (such as Tanapox and Yabapox)). Non-enveloped infectious viruses include such as members of the following families: Calciviridae (such as strains that cause gastroenteritis); Arenaviridae (hemorrhagic fever viruses such as LCMV, Lassa, Junin, Machupo and Guanarito viruses); Reoviridae (for instance, reoviruses, orbiviruses and rotaviruses); Birnaviridae; Parvoviridae (parvoviruses, such as Human bocavirus adeno-associated virus); Papillomaviridae (such as papillomaviruses); Papovaviridae (papilloma viruses, polyoma viruses); Adenoviridae (adenoviruses); Picornaviridae (enteroviruses, enteric viruses, Poliovirus, coxsackieviruses, hepatoviruses, cardioviruses, aptoviruses, echoviruses, hepatitis A virus, Foot and mouth disease virus, and rhinovirus) and Iridoviridae (such as African swine fever virus). Other infectious viruses include unclassified viruses (for example, the etiological agents of Spongiform encephalopathies, the agent of delta hepatitis (thought to be a defective satellite of hepatitis B virus), the agents of non-A, non-B hepatitis (class 1 = internally transmitted; class 2 = parenterally transmitted (for instance, Hepatitis C); calciviruses (such as Norovirus, Norwalk and related viruses); Hepeviruses (such as Hepatitis E, JC and BK viruses) and astroviruses). Examples of infectious bacteria that can be treated with the methods provided herein include any type of Gram-positive (such as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Listeria, Bacillus and Clostridium) or Gram- negative bacteria (such as Salmonella, Shigella, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Moraxella, Helicobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Bdellovibrio, acetic acid bacteria, and alpha-proteobacteria), Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens).

The damage may be due to trauma, lack of blood supply, hemorrhage, autoimmune attack, transplanted exogenous tissue or infection. This generalized response by the body includes the release of many components of the immune system (for instance, IL-I and TNF), attraction of cells to the site of the damage, swelling of tissue due to the release of fluid and other processes. Isolated: An \"isolated\" biological component (such as a nucleic acid molecule, peptide, or cell) has been purified away from other biological components in a mixed sample (such as a cell extract). For example, an \"isolated\" peptide or nucleic acid molecule is a peptide or nucleic acid molecule that has been separated from the other components of a cell in which the peptide or nucleic acid molecule was present (such as an expression host cell for a recombinant peptide or nucleic acid molecule).\n\n\nOpportunistic infection: An infection that occurs in an immunocompromised subject. An opportunistic infection can result from medical treatments or from alterations in the immune system. Opportunistic infections can include, but are not limited to, bacterial infections such as salmonellosis, syphilis and neurosyphilis, tuberculosis (TB), atypical mycobacterial infection, and bacillary angiomatosis (cat scratch disease), fungal infections such as aspergillosis, candidiasis (thrush, yeast infection), coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcal meningitis, and histoplasmosis, protozoal infections such as crypto sporidio sis, isosporiasis, \n\n microsporidiosis, Pneumocystis Carinii pneumonia (PCP), and toxoplasmosis, viral infections such as Cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis, herpes simplex (HSV, genital herpes), herpes zoster (HZV, shingles), human papiloma virus (HPV, genital warts, cervical cancer), Molluscum Contagiosum, oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL), and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and neoplasms, such as Kaposi's sarcoma, systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and primary CNS lymphoma, among others.\n\n\nParenteral: Administered outside of the intestine, for instance, not via the alimentary tract. Generally, parenteral formulations are those that will be administered through any possible mode except ingestion. This term especially refers to injections, whether administered intravenously, intrathecally, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, intra-articularly, or subcutaneously, and various surface applications including intranasal, intradermal, and topical application, for instance. Pharmaceutical agent or drug: A chemical compound or composition capable of inducing a desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect when properly administered to a subject. Pharmaceutical agents include, but are not limited to, TAM receptor inhibitors, TAM receptor agonists, anti-infective agents, such as antibiotics, anti-fungal compounds, anti-viral compounds, and hyper-immune globulin, anti-cancer agents, for instance, chemotherapeutics, immunosuppressive agents, for instance, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, biological response modifiers, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable carriers: The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers useful in this disclosure are conventional. Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, by E. W. Martin, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 15th Edition (1975), describes compositions and formulations suitable for pharmaceutical delivery of the inhibitors herein disclosed.\n\n\nIn general, the nature of the carrier will depend on the particular mode of administration being employed. For instance, parenteral formulations usually include injectable fluids that include pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluids such as water, physiological saline, balanced salt solutions, aqueous dextrose, glycerol or the like as a vehicle. For solid compositions (for instance, powder, pill, tablet, or capsule forms), conventional non-toxic solid carriers can include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, \n\n starch, or magnesium stearate. In addition to biologically-neutral carriers, pharmaceutical compositions to be administered can contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives, and pH buffering agents and the like, for example sodium acetate or sorbitan monolaurate.\n\n\nRetroviruses: RNA viruses wherein the viral genome is RNA. When a host cell is infected with a retrovirus, the genomic RNA is reverse transcribed into a DNA intermediate which is integrated very efficiently into the chromosomal DNA of infected cells. The integrated DNA intermediate is referred to as a provirus. The term \"lentivirus\" is used in its conventional sense to describe a genus of viruses containing reverse transcriptase. The lentiviruses include the \"immunodeficiency viruses\" which include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 and type 2 (HIV-I and HIV-2), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). HIV is a retrovirus that causes immunosuppression in humans (HIV disease), and leads to a disease complex known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). \"HIV disease\" refers to a well-recognized constellation of signs and symptoms (including the development of opportunistic infections) in persons who are infected by an HIV virus, as determined by antibody or western blot studies. Laboratory findings associated with this disease include a progressive decline in T-helper cells.\n\n\nSepsis: A serious medical condition characterized by a whole-body inflammatory state caused by infection. As used here, the term \"infection\" means a pathological process induced by a microorganism. Such an infection can be caused by pathogenic gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, fungi, yeast, or polymicrobial organisms. Exemplary non-limiting sites of such infections are respiratory tract infections, peritonitis, genitourinary infections, and intraabdoiminal infections. As used herein, \"sepsis\" includes all stages of sepsis including, but not limited to, the onset of sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction associated with the end stages of sepsis.\n\n\nThe \"onset of sepsis\" refers to an early stage of sepsis, for example, prior to a stage when conventional clinical manifestations are sufficient to support a clinical suspicion of sepsis. \"Severe sepsis\" refers to sepsis associated with organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion abnormalities, or sepsis-induced hypotension. \n\n Hypoperfusion abnormalities include, but are not limited to, lactic acidosis, oliguria, or an acute alteration in mental status. \"Septic shock\" in adults refers to a state of acute circulatory failure characterized by persistent arterial hypotension unexplained by other causes. Hypotension is defined by a systolic arterial pressure below 90 mm Hg (or, in children, below normal for their age), a MAP below 60, or a reduction in systolic blood pressure of greater than 40 mm Hg from baseline, despite adequate volume resuscitation, in the absence of other causes for hypotension.\n\n\nSymptoms of sepsis are often related to the underlying infectious process. When the infection crosses into sepsis, the resulting symptoms are that of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS): general inflammation, fever, elevated white blood cell count (leukocytosis), and raised heart rate (tachycardia) and breathing rate (tachypnea). The immunological response that causes sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response causing widespread activation of inflammation and coagulation pathways. This can progress to dysfunction of the circulatory system and, even under optimal treatment, can result in the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and eventually death.\n\n\nIn the United States, sepsis is the leading cause of death in non-coronary intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and the tenth most common cause of death overall. Sepsis is common and also more dangerous in elderly, immunocompromised, and critically ill patients. It occurs in l%-2% of all hospitalizations and accounts for as much as 25% of ICU bed utilization. It is a major cause of death in intensive care units worldwide, with mortality rates that range from 20% for sepsis to 40% for severe sepsis to >60% for septic shock. Patients are defined as having \"severe sepsis\" if they have sepsis plus signs of systemic hypoperfusion; either end organ dysfunction or a serum lactate greater then 4 mmol/dL.\n\n\nCurrent therapies for sepsis include antibiotics, surgical drainage of infected fluid collections, fluid replacement and appropriate support for organ dysfunction. This can include hemodialysis in kidney failure, mechanical ventilation in pulmonary dysfunction, transfusion of blood products, and drug and fluid therapy for circulatory failure. Ensuring adequate nutrition, if necessary by parenteral nutrition, can be important during prolonged illness. \n\n siRNA: Double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that can induce gene-specific inhibition of expression in invertebrate and vertebrate species are provided. These RNAs are suitable for interference or inhibition of expression of a target gene (e.g., a TAM receptor or ligand thereof) and comprise double stranded RNAs of about 15 to about 40 nucleotides containing a 3' and/or 5' overhang on each strand having a length of 0- to about 5 -nucleotides, wherein the sequence of the double stranded RNAs is substantially identical to a portion of a mRNA or transcript of the target gene for which interference or inhibition of expression is desired. The double stranded RNAs can be formed from complementary ssRNAs or from a single stranded RNA that forms a hairpin or from expression from a DNA vector.\n\n\nIn addition to native RNA molecules, RNA suitable for inhibiting or interfering with the expression of a target sequence include RNA derivatives and analogs. For example, a non-natural linkage between nucleotide residues can be used, such as a phosphorothioate linkage. The RNA strand can be derivatized with a reactive functional group or a reporter group, such as a fluorophore. Particularly useful derivatives are modified at a terminus or termini of an RNA strand, typically the 3' terminus of the sense strand. For example, the 2'-hydroxyl at the 3' terminus can be readily and selectively derivatized with a variety of groups.\n\n\nOther useful RNA derivatives incorporate nucleotides having modified carbohydrate moieties, such as 2'-O-alkylated residues or 2'-deoxy-2'-halogenated derivatives. Particular examples of such carbohydrate moieties include 2'-O- methyl ribosyl derivatives and 2'-O-fluoro ribosyl derivatives.\n\n\nThe RNA bases may also be modified. Any modified base useful for inhibiting or interfering with the expression of a target sequence can be used. For example, halogenated bases, such as 5-bromouracil and 5-iodouracil can be incorporated. The bases can also be alkylated, for example, 7-methylguanosine can be incorporated in place of a guanosine residue. Non-natural bases that yield successful inhibition can also be incorporated.\n\n\nSubject: Living multi-cellular vertebrate organisms, a category that includes both human and non-human mammals. The methods and compositions disclosed herein have equal applications in medical and veterinary settings. Therefore, the general term \"subject\" is understood to include all animals, including, but not limited to, humans or veterinary subjects, such as other primates, dogs, cats, horses, and cows. \n\n TAM receptor: The TAM family (Tyro 3, AxI, and Mer) was first identified as a distinct receptor protein-tyro sine kinase (PTK) family (Lai & Lemke, (1991) Neuron. 6(5):691-704). Designated Tyro 3, Tyro 7, and Tyro 12 at that time, the kinase domains of these proteins clearly segregated into a separate family based on sequence conservation (Lai & Lemke, (1991) Neuron. 6(5): 691- 704). Subsequent isolation of full-length cDNAs by multiple groups confirmed this segregation, and also resulted in multiple names for the receptors. Tyro 3, AxI, and Mer are now the consensus, assigned gene designations. An analysis of the mouse and human 'kinomes' indicates that Tyro 3, AxI, and Mer constitute the full TAM family. (There are 58 receptor PTK genes in the human and mouse genomes.) Specific examples of AxI receptor amino acid sequences include, but are not limited to Genbank Accession Nos. NP OO 1690 (invariant ATP binding Lysine (K) 558) and NP_068713 (as of November 9, 2007). Specific examples of Tyro 3 receptor amino acid sequences include, but are not limited to Genbank Accession Nos. NP_006284 (invariant ATP binding Lysine (K) 550), EAW92506, and EAW92507 (as of November 9, 2007). Specific examples of Mer receptor amino acid sequences include, but are not limited to Genbank Accession Nos. AAK54121, AAI14918 (invariant ATP binding Lysine (K) 443), and AAI14918 (as of November 9, 2007). The invariant ATP binding site Lysine (K) is located in the sequence VAVKTM.\n\n\nThe TAM receptors share an arrangement of sequence motifs in their extracellular regions in which two tandem immunoglobulin (Ig)-related domains are immediately followed by two fibronectin type III (FNIII)-related repeats. These receptors are the only receptor PTKs to display this particular array of Ig and FNIII domains. The ectodomains of Tyro 3, AxI, and Mer are all followed closely by a single transmembrane domain, a relatively large cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region, and a split tyrosine kinase domain. For example, the extracellular domain of human AxI (Genbank Accession No. NP 068713.2 as of November 7, 2008) spans amino acid positions from about position 1 to about position 445 amino and contains two Ig domains and two FNIII domains. The first Ig domain, denoted herein as IgI, includes from about position 33 to about position 137. The second Ig domain, denoted herein as Ig2, includes from about position 139 to about position 222 of SEQ ID NO:2. The first FNIII domain, denoted herein as FNIII(a), includes from about position 225 to about position 328. The \n\n second FNIII domain, denoted herein as FNIII(b), includes from about position 337 to about position 418. Further, the intracellular domain, such as the intracellular domain of Mer (such as the amino acid sequence of Mer Genbank Accession No. NP_032613.1 as of November 7, 2008) spans amino acid positions from about position 521 to about position 994.\n\n\nThe positions of each of the domains of each of the TAM receptors, including their ligand binding domains and the ATP and substrate binding sites of the protein-tyro sine kinase domains, are known in the art and are readily accessible in public NCBI and National Library of Medicine (NLM) databases. For example, the extracellular domain of the human Tyro3 protein (Genbank Accession No. EAW92508 as of November 7, 2008), contains a first Ig domain from about position 41 to about position 120, a second Ig domain from about position 130 to about position 205, a first FNIII domain from about position 215 to about position 305, and a second FNIII domain from about position 315 to about position 397. The Tyro3 protein-tyro sine kinase domain extends from about position 510 to about position 730. The extracellular domain of the human c-Mer protein (GenBank Accession No. EAW52097 as of November 7, 2008) contains a first Ig domain from about position 115 to about position 187, a second Ig domain from about position 195 to about position 280, a first FNIII domain from about position 285 to about position 375, and a second FNIII domain from about position 387 to about position 478. The c-Mer substrate binding site extends from about position 725 to about position 750.\n\n\nThe TAM receptor ligands include Protein S and Gas6. \"TAM receptor activity\" includes any biological activity of the TAM receptor, for instance an activity that is enhanced or induced by the binding of a TAM receptor ligand (e.g., Gas6 or Protein S) to the receptor. An \"enhancer of TAM receptor activity\" includes any composition that increases TAM receptor activity. Examples of an inecrease in TAM receptor activity include, but are not limited to a an increase in TAM autophosphorylation, a decrease in TLR-induced cytokine production, a decrease in TLR-induced stimulation of MAP kinase activation, a decrease in TLR-induced NF-kB activation, and an increase in SOCSl and/or SOCS 3 expression. An \"inhibitor of TAM receptor activity\" includes any composition that decreases TAM receptor activity. Examples of a decrease in TAM receptor activity include, but are not limited to a decrease in TAM autophosphorylation, an \n\n increase in TLR-induced cytokine production, an increase in TLR-induced stimulation of MAP kinase activation, an increase in TLR-induced NF-kB activation, and a decrease in SOCSl and/or SOCS 3 expression. Exemplary methods for measuring such activity are provided herein. Therapeutically effective amount: An amount of a therapeutic agent\n\n\n(such as a TAM receptor inhibitor or TAM receptor agonist), alone or in combination with other agents (such as a vaccine or dendritic cells or an immunosuppressive agent) sufficient to prevent advancement of a disease, to cause regression of the disease, or which is capable of relieving symptoms caused by the disease, such as fever, respiratory symptoms, pain or swelling.\n\n\nTreating a disease: \"Treatment\" refers to a therapeutic intervention that ameliorates a sign or symptom of a disease or pathological condition (e.g., an autoimmune disorder, sepsis or other infection) after it has begun to develop. As used herein, the term \"treatment\" also encompasses \"prevention,\" which refers to inhibiting the full development of a disease, for example in a person who is known to have a predisposition to a disease such as a person who has been or is at risk for being exposed to an infective agent or who has been or is at risk for developing an autoimmune disease.. Examples of persons at risk for being exposed to an infective agent include, but are not limited to, military personnel, medical personnel, travelers, and caregivers of adults and children, as well as those with weakened immune systems, for example, the elderly, people on immunosuppressive drugs, subjects with cancer, and subjects infected with HIV. For treatment of sepsis, in one embodiment, treatment is for severe sepsis, septic shock, or treatment of sepsis where SOCS inhibitor levels are high, or, in some instances, maximal. Such a treatment is less effective early in infection, when\n\n\nSOCS inhibitor levels (elevated by TAM signaling) are not yet maximal. In some embodiments, measurement of Gas6 in plasma is a biomarker for sepsis (see, for instance, Gibot et al., (2007) Crit Care;\\ 1(1):R8; Borgel et al., (2006) Crit Care Med. 34(l):219-22). Examples of persons at risk for developing an autoimmune disease include, but are not limited to, people with a family history of one or more autoimmune disease, those who are at risk of exposure to certain environmental triggers, subjects producing antibodies to self-antigens, and subjects who have undergone transplantation. \n\n Vaccine: A preparation of antigen, DNA, protein subunit, peptide, attenuated microorganisms (including but not limited to bacteria and viruses), dendritic cells activated against a tumor (e.g., cancer), living microorganisms, or killed microorganisms, administered for the prevention, amelioration or treatment of a disease, for instance, cancer, or an infectious disease.\n\n\nGenerally, the first step in making a vaccine is to isolate or create an organism, or part of one, which is unable to cause full blown disease, but that still retains the antigens responsible for inducing the host's immune response. This can be done in many ways. One way is to kill the organism using heat or formalin; vaccines produced in this way are called \"inactivated\" or \"killed\" vaccines.\n\n\nExamples of killed vaccines in common use today are the typhoid vaccine and the SaIk poliomyelitis vaccine.\n\n\nAnother way to produce a vaccine is to use only the antigenic part of the disease-causing organism, for example the capsule, the flagella, or part of the protein cell wall; these types of vaccines are called \"acellular vaccines.\" An example of an acellular vaccine is the Haemophilus influenzae B (HIB) vaccine. Acellular vaccines exhibit some similarities to killed vaccines: neither killed nor acellular vaccines generally induce the strongest immune responses and can therefore require a \"booster\" every few years to insure their continued effectiveness. In addition, neither killed nor acellular vaccines can cause disease and are therefore considered to be safe for use in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n\nA third way of making a vaccine is to \"attenuate\" or weaken a live microorganism by mutating the organism to alter its growth capabilities. In one embodiment an attenuated vaccine is not replication competent or lacks essential proteins. Examples of attenuated vaccines are those that protect against measles, mumps, and rubella. Immunity is often life-long with attenuated vaccines and does not require booster shots.\n\n\nVaccines also can be produced from a toxin. In these cases, the toxin is often treated with aluminum or adsorbed onto aluminum salts to form a \"toxoid.\" Examples of toxoids are the diphtheria and the tetanus vaccines. Vaccines made from toxoids often induce low-level immune responses and are therefore sometimes administered with an adjuvant. For example, the diphtheria and tetanus vaccines are often combined with the pertussis vaccine and administered together \n\n as a DPT immunization. The pertussis acts as an adjuvant in this vaccine. When more than one vaccine is administered together it is called a \"conjugated vaccine.\" Another way of making a vaccine is to use an organism that is similar to the virulent organism, but that does not cause serious disease, such as using the cowpox virus to protect against infection with smallpox virus, or BCG vaccine, an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, used to protect against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n\n\n\"Subunit vaccines\" are vaccines which use a polypeptide from an infectious organism to stimulate a strong immune response. An \"antigen vaccine\" uses an immunogenic epitope of a polypeptide to induce a protective immune response. A\n\n\n\"DNA vaccine\" uses a nucleic acid encoding an antigen to induce a protective immune response.\n\n\nSpecific, non-limiting examples of vaccines that can be used with the TAM receptor inhibitors and methods of the present disclosure include the BioThrax Anthrax vaccine currently in use by the U.S. military and the DTP (diptheria- tetanus-pertussis) vaccine, the HIB (Haemophilus influenzae type B) vaccine, the\n\n\nPneumococcal conjugate, the Hepatitis A vaccine, the Hepatitis B vaccine, the\n\n\nHuman papillomavirus vaccine, and the Rabies vaccines.\n\n\nOther vaccines that can be used according to the methods described herein are dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines, for instance cancer vaccines. In general, a dendritic cell-based vaccine involves obtaining dendritic cells from a subject's blood via leukapheresis. The DCs are then stimulated ex vivo with antigens, for instance the subject's own cancer antigens, cultured, and re-administered (for instance, subcutaneously) into the subject. Once administered, DC vaccines activate the immune system's T cells. Activation by DCs causes the T cells to multiply and attack tumor cells that express that antigen. DC-based vaccines are discussed at greater length below.\n\n\nUnless otherwise explained, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs.

Use of TAM Receptor Inhibitors as Immunoenhancers and TAM Receptor Agonists as Immunosuppressors\n\n\nA. Overview\n\n\nThe innate immune response to pathogens represents the first line of defense against infectious disease. Among the most potent mediators of this response are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a set of receptors that activate host \n\n defenses responsible for local inflammation, the recruitment of effector cells, and the secretion of cytokines that modulate both the innate and adaptive immune responses (Akira (2006) Curr Top Microbiol Immunol 311, 1-16; Beutler et ah, (2006) Annu Rev Immunol 24, 353-389). The twelve TLRs encoded in mammalian genomes are 'pattern recognition receptors,' which detect a diverse set of largely invariant molecular signatures displayed by invading pathogens. TLR-4, for example, recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Poltorak et α/., (1998) Science 282, 2085-2088). Similarly, TLR-9 recognizes bacterial DNA that contains unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (Hemmi et ah, (2000) Nature 408, 740- 745), and TLR-3 and TLR-7 are activated by double and single stranded RNAs, respectively (Alexopoulou et ah, (2001) Nature 413, 732-73; Heil et ah, (2004) Science 303, 1526-1529).\n\n\nTLRs are prominently expressed in sentinel cells, such as DCs and macrophages, which drive the innate immune response (Iwasaki & Medzhitov (2004) Nat Immunol 5, 987-995). Activation of TLRs engages multiple intracellular adaptor and signaling proteins, including MyD88, TRIF, and TRAF6 (Akira (2006) Curr Top Microbiol Immunol 311, 1-16). Subsequently, evolutionarily ancient signal transduction cascades, centered on the MAP kinase pathways and the NF-κB and interferon response factor (IRF) transcription factors, are activated, resulting in the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL- 12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, and type 1 interferons (IFNs). Additionally, DCs are the professional antigen-presenting cells that bridge the innate and adaptive immune responses (Steinman & Hemmi (2006) Curr Top Microbiol Immunol 311, 17-58). TLR activation in DCs induces the secretion of cytokines and the up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules that subsequently orchestrate the adaptive response (Iwasaki & Medzhitov (2004) Nat Immunol 5, 987-995).\n\n\nAlthough innate immunity is essential for the protection of organisms, it must be properly regulated, since unrestrained DC activation and the resulting inflammatory environment can lead to the development of chronic inflammation and a response against self (Marshak-Rothstein (2006) Nat Rev Immunol 6, 823- 835). The sustained stimulation of DC maturation that is brought on by elevated levels of type I IFNs and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, for example, is \n\n associated with the development of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (Banchereau & Pascual (2006) Immunity 25, 383-392), Sjogren's syndrome (Gottenberg et al. (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 103, 2770-2775), and psoriasis (Lowes et al, (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102, 19057-19062). Consistent with a requirement for the eventual inhibition of an inflammatory response, it is now increasingly evident that TLR activation in DCs drives, and is itself modulated by, the production of negative regulators that feed back upon and inhibit this activation (Liew et al., (2005) Nat Rev Immunol 5, 446-458). Prominent among such TLR-driven inhibitors are the SOCS proteins, whose importance in maintaining immune homeostasis is highlighted by the phenotype of SOCSl -deficient mice, which exhibit hyperactivation of DCs and develop lupus- like disease (Hanada et al., (2003) Immunity 19, 437-450). Their importance notwithstanding, prior to this disclosure, how the induction of negative regulators is integrated with the TLR-activated inflammation response remained to be elucidated.\n\n\nDescribed herein is a novel negative regulatory pathway driven by receptor tyrosine kinases of the Tyro3/TAM family (Lai & Lemke (1991) Neuron. 6(5): 691-704), and establish its role as a pleiotropic inhibitor of both TLR- and cytokine-driven immune responses. Previously, it was demonstrated that loss of function of the three TAM receptors, Tyro 3, AxI, and Mer, results in profound dysregulation of the immune response (Caraux et al., (2006) Nat Immunol 7, 747- 754; Lemke & Lu (2003) Curr Opin Immunol 15, 31-36; Lu & Lemke (2001) Science 293, 306-311). Tyro S^Axl^Mer\n\"\n'\n\"\n triple mutant mice (TAM TKOs) display massive splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, lymphocyte infiltration of essentially all tissues, high circulating autoantibody titers (to phospholipids, collagen, ribonucleoproteins, and double-stranded DNA), and broad spectrum autoimmune disease (Lu & Lemke (2001) Science 293, 306-311). Even Mer-/- single mutants develop appreciable splenomegaly and are hypersensitive to LPS- induced endotoxic shock (Camenisch et al. (1999) J Immunol 162, 3498-3503). These phenotypes are cell non-autonomous with respect to lymphocytes, and, without being bound by theory, are thought to result from the loss of TAM signaling in antigen-presenting cells (APCs; Lu & Lemke (2001) Science 293, 306- 311; Lemke & Lu (2003) Curr Opin Immunol 15, 31-36). Described herein is a comprehensive analysis of TAM function in the DC subset of APCs. Also \n\n disclosed is a previously unrecognized pathway of TAM-mediated negative regulation of both TLR activation and cytokine production in these cells. This pathway controls the phased attenuation of DC activation.\n\n\nAs described herein, TAM receptor inhibitors can be used as immunoenhancers, for example as a vaccine adjuvant, in the treatment of sepsis, and in the treatment of immunodeficiency. One embodiment of the disclosure is a method of enhancing an immune response in a subject, which can include administering to a subject in need of immunoenhancement (e.g., a subject with severe sepsis, an immunocompromised subject, or a subject to whom a vaccine is administered) one or more TAM receptor inhibitors. The method can be accomplished by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a TAM receptor inhibitor to a subject in need of immunoenhancement, thereby enhancing the immune response in the subject. The immune response to a TAM receptor inhibitor can be measured using routine methods. For example, in the context of vaccine adjuvants, patient response can be monitored by the measurement of circulating serum IgG antibodies to the vaccine target (immunogen), as measured by routine methods such as ELISA or other immunoassay. Humoral (circulating antibody) immunity is linked to the presence of antibodies to the immunogen in the vaccine. In particular examples, such as for use of TAM inhibitors as a vaccine against anthrax, antibodies against recombinant protective antigen (rPA) of the anthrax bacillus can be monitoreds..\n\n\nOther embodiments described herein include methods of screening for an immunoenhancing agent. In some embodiments, these methods include contacting a cell expressing a TAM receptor with a test agent, and determining whether the test agent inhibits TAM receptor activity. These methods are described in greater detail below.\n\n\nAlso as described herein, TAM receptor agonists can be used as immunosuppressors, for example, in the treatment of autoimmune disorders, to prevent or transplant rejection, or treat or prevent graft-versus-host disease following transplant. One embodiment of the disclosure is a method of suppressing an immune response in a subject, which can include administering a TAM receptor agonist to a subject in need of immunosuppression (for instance, a subject with an autoimmune disease, a subject with an allergy, or a subject who has received (or will receive) an organ or tissue transplant). The method can be \n\n accomplished by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a TAM receptor agonist to a subject in need of immunosuppression, thereby suppressing the immune response in the subject. The immune response to a TAM receptor agonist can be measured using routine methods. For example, in the treatment of autoimmune disease, patient response can be monitored by, for example, the measurement of circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and/or IFNs, including IFNα and IFNβ, as measured by routine methods such as ELISA or other immunoassay. A successful response to the immunosuppression is demonstrated as lowered levels of one or more of these cytokines. Patient response can also be monitored by any of several well-described and frequently- employed alternatives, including body temperature: inflammation is associated with elevated body temperature, and immunosuppression restores temperature to normal levels (-98.6\n0\nF in humans).\n\n\nOther embodiments described herein include methods of screening for an immunosuppressive agent. In some embodiments, these methods include contacting a cell expressing a TAM receptor with a test agent, and determining whether the test agent increases TAM receptor activity. These methods are also described in greater detail below.\n\n\nB. TAM receptors and ligands\n\n\nTAM receptors are receptor tyrosine kinases. These cell surface receptor proteins include an extracellular ligand-binding domain {e.g., a domain that binds Gas6 or Protein S ligands), a transmembrane spanning domain, and an intracellular domain responsible for kinase activity. The TAM receptors share an arrangement of sequence motifs in their extracellular regions in which two tandem immunoglobulin (Ig)-related domains are immediately followed by two fibronectin type III (FNIII)-related repeats. These receptors are the only receptor PTKs to display this particular array of Ig and FNIII domains. The ectodomains of Tyro3, AxI, and Mer are all followed closely by a single transmembrane domain, a relatively large cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region, and a split tyrosine kinase domain. Specific examples of AxI receptor amino acid sequences include, but are not limited to Genbank Accession Nos. NP_001690 and NP_068713 (as of November 9, 2007). Specific examples of Tyro3 receptor amino acid sequences include, but are not limited to Genbank Accession Nos. NP_006284, EAW92506, \n\n and EAW92507 (as of as of November 9, 2007). Specific examples of Mer receptor amino acid sequences include, but are not limited to Genbank Accession Nos. AAK54121, AAI14918, and AAI14918 (as of as of November 9, 2007).\n\n\nThe extracellular domain of human AxI (NP 068713.2) spans amino acid positions from about position 1 to about position 445 amino and contains two Ig domains and two FNIII domains. The first Ig domain, denoted herein as IgI, includes from about position 33 to about position 137. The second Ig domain, denoted herein as Ig2, includes from about position 139 to about position 222 of SEQ ID NO:2. The first FNIII domain, denoted herein as FNIII(a), includes from about position 225 to about position 328. The second FNIII domain, denoted herein as FNIII(b), includes from about position 337 to about position 418. Further, the intracellular domain, such as the intracellular domain of Mer (such as the amino acid sequence of Mer Genbank Accession No. NP_032613.1 as of November 7, 2008) spans amino acid positions from about position 521 to about position 994.\n\n\nThe positions of each of the domains of each of the TAM receptors are are known. For example, the extracellular domain of the human Tyro3 protein (Genbank Accession No. EAW92508 as of November 7, 2008), contains a first Ig domain from about position 41 to about position 120, a second Ig domain from about position 130 to about position 205, a first FNIII domain from about position 215 to about position 305, and a second FNIII domain from about position 315 to about position 397. The Tyro3 protein-tyro sine kinase domain extends from about position 510 to about position 730. The extracellular domain of the human c-Mer protein (GenBank Accession No. EAW52097 as of November 7, 2008) contains a first Ig domain from about position 115 to about position 187, a second Ig domain from about position 195 to about position 280, a first FNIII domain from about position 285 to about position 375, and a second FNIII domain from about position 387 to about position 478. The c-Mer substrate binding site extends from about position 725 to about position 750. The TAM receptor ligands include Protein S and Gas6. Protein S (ProS) is an anticoagulant in the blood coagulation cascade. It acts as a co-factor for activated protein C, a protease that degrades Factor V and Factor VTII and thereby inhibits blood coagulation. Gas6, an acronym for growth-arrest-specific protein 6, was originally identified in a screen for mRNAs that were induced when \n\n fibroblasts were growth arrested in culture. Gas6 is expressed in discrete cellular loci in a variety of adult tissues, very often in cell layers that are apposed to or intermingled with cells that express Tyro3, AxI, or Mer (Lu & Lemke, (2001) Science. 293(5528):306-l 1). Many cell types co-express both Gas6 and Protein S, and at the same time also express one or more TAM receptors (Lu & Lemke, (2001) Science. 293(5528):306-l l).\n\n\nGas6 and Protein S exhibit 44% amino acid sequence identity overall, share the same complex multi-domain structure, and are the only two proteins encoded in the mouse and human genomes that display this configuration of domains. The amino-terminal segments of both proteins contain long strings of glutamic acids residues that are carboxylated on their γ carbons, in a vitamin K-dependent reaction in the Golgi. These so called 'Gla-domains', whose γ carboxylation is essential to both Ca\n+2\n binding and full biological activity, are common to a number of proteins that bind polar phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS). The extracellularly-displayed PS is a signature of apoptotic cells. In Gas6 and ProS, the GIa domain (such as amino acids 49-90 of Gas6) is closely followed by a loop domain {e.g., amino acids 91-117 of human Gas6), and then by four tandem EGF- related domains {e.g., amino acids 118-278 of human Gas6). These are in turn followed by a carboxy-terminal domain that contains two laminin G repeats {e.g., amino acids 279-678 of human Gas6) that are structurally related to those of the sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The SHBG-related domains of Gas6 and ProS account for both ligand binding and receptor activation, and will fully activate the TAM receptors in the absence of the GIa domain and/or the EGF domain.\n\n\nC. TAM receptor inhibitors\n\n\nTAM receptor inhibitors include agents that significantly reduce or even inhibit the biological activity of a TAM receptor in a cell. Such agents need not inhibit TAM receptor activity by 100%, lesser amounts can be effective in the methods provided herein. For example, a TAM receptor inhibitor may decrease the biological activity by at least 25%, at least 50%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or even at least 99%. Methods of measuring such activity are known in the art. In some examples, a decrease in biological activity is indicated by a decrease in expression of Tyro3, AxI, or Mer or combinations \n\n thereof (at the DNA, RNA, or protein level). In other examples, a decrease in biological activity is indicated by a change in a downstream effect, such a reduction in TAM autophosphorylation, increase in TLR-induced cytokine production, increase in TLR-induced stimulation of MAP kinase activation, increase in TLR-induced NF-kB activation, or reduction in SOCSl and SOCS 3 expression. Methods of detecting such alternations in expression or activity (which in some examples are quantified) are routine, and can include Western blotting, ELISA, flow cytometry, northern blotting, PCR, RT-PCR, and the like. In some examples, TAM receptor inhibitors bind with high specificity to the TAM receptor extracellular domain or to a Tyro3, AxI, or Mer ligand. Such agents therefore substantially decrease or prevent the interaction between the ligand and the receptor and for example can significantly reduce or inhibit receptor activation, for example by preventing signaling from the receptor and reducing or inhibiting downstream biological effects. Examples of such inhibitors can include antibodies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies, for example humanized monoclonal antibodies) or other small molecules that bind to a Tyro3, AxI, or Mer ligand, or a Tyro3, AxI, or Mer receptor, and prevent or significantly reduce the interaction of the ligand binding to the receptor. In another example, such inhibitors target a Tyro3, AxI, or Mer intracellular domain, such as a kinase domain or ATP binding site, and thus for example significantly reduce or inhibit receptor activation, for example by preventing signaling from the receptor and reducing or inhibiting downstream biological effects. Examples of such inhibitors can include small molecule inhibitors, for example those that are membrane permeable, for example AXL-I, AXL-2, AXL-3, AXL-4, AXL-5, AXL-6, AXL-7, AXL-8, AXL-9, MP470, and SGI-AXL-277. In some examples, the AXL inhibitor is a triazole derivative. Examples of AXL inhibitors are disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication 2007/0213375, filed September 13, 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In certain examples, the AXL inhibitor is a triazole derivative with one of the following general structures: \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNH? or\n\n\no\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein R can be H or CH\n3\n. One skilled in the art will appreciate that other derivatives can be made. In yet other examples, TAM receptor inhibitors substantially decrease or inhibit expression of a TAM receptor, such as RNAi molecules that significantly decrease or inhibit expression of Tyro3, AxI or Mer. In yet other examples, TAM receptor inhibitors substantially decrease or inhibit expression of a TAM receptor ligand, such as RNAi molecules that significantly decrease or inhibit expression of a Tyro3, AxI or Mer ligand, thereby decreasing the amount of ligand available to activate the TAM receptor.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, a TAM receptor inhibitor has an IC50 of less than about 50 μM, for instance, less than about 50 nM, or less than 1 pM. In particular embodiments, a TAM receptor inhibitor has an IC50 of about 10 μM or 20 μM, 0.05 μM to about 5 μM, 0.1 nM to 20 nM, 1 pM to about 10 μM, or 0.1 pM to 50 pM, and in particular embodiments, a TAM receptor inhibitor has an IC50 of less than from about 0.005 nM to about 50 nM or from about 0.05 nM to about 50 nM. In addition to the known TAM receptor inhibitors, higher potency inhibitors are generated by chemical modification of the existing inhibitors. For instance, the known compounds generally work in the low micromolar or low nanomolar range, however chemical modification makes them, in some embodiments, more potent and more specific (e.g., work in the low picomoloar range). In one embodiment, QSAR analysis is performed using the solved Kinase Domain Crystal Structure of MERTK. AxI and Tyro3 kinases also may be modeled upon this crystal structure \n\n (see, for instance, Walker, Huang, Finerty Jr., Weigelt, Sundstrom, Arrowsmith, Edwards, Bochkarev, Dhe-Paganon, Human Proto-oncogene Tyro sine-protein Kinase MER; PDB (protein data base) 2P0C). These more potent compositions will have lower IC50 values. In some examples, a TAM receptor inhibitor specifically binds to a target\n\n\n(such as a extracellular binding domain, ligand, or intracellular kinase domain of Tyro, AxI, or Mer) with a binding constant that is at least 10\n3\n M\n\"1\n greater, 10\n4\n M\n\"1\n greater or 10\n5\n M\n\"1\n greater than a binding constant for other molecules in a sample. In some examples, a TAM receptor inhibitor (such as an aptamer, antibody (e.g., monoclonal antibody) or fragments thereof) has an equilibrium constant (Kd) of 1 nM or less. For example, TAM receptor inhibitors are provided that bind to a TAM receptor (such as a extracellular binding domain, ligand, or intracellular kinase domain of Tyro, AxI, or Mer) with a binding affinity of at least about 0.1 x 10\n\"8\n M, at least about 0.3 x 10\n\"8\n M, at least about 0.5 x 10\n\"8\n M, at least about 0.75 x 10\n\"8\n M, at least about 1.0 x 10\n\"8\n M, at least about 1.3 x 10\n\"8\n M at least about 1.5 x 10\n\"8\nM, or at least about 2.O x 10\n\"8\n M. Kd values can, for example, be determined by competitive ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) or using a surface- plasmon resonance device such as the Biacore TlOO, which is available from Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ. The ability of a TAM receptor inhibitor (e.g., RNAi, aptamer, antibody, or membrane permeable small molecule) to function as an immunoenhancer can be performed using the methods described herein. For example, potential TAM receptor inhibitors can be screened for their ability to function as an immunoenhancer. In some examples, the ability of potential TAM receptor inhibitors to enhance a subject's response to a vaccine or treat a disease of immunosuppressio or sepsis is tested.\n\n\n1. Membrane-permeable small molecules\n\n\nIn some embodiments, TAM receptor inhibitors are small molecule inhibitors that bind to an ATP binding site of Tyro3, AxI, or Mer. Specific examples of AxI receptor amino acid sequences include, but are not limited to\n\n\nGenbank Accession Nos. NP_001690 (invariant ATP binding Lysine (K) 558) and NP_068713 (as of November 9, 2007). Specific examples of Tyro 3 receptor amino acid sequences include, but are not limited to Genbank Accession Nos. NP_006284 (invariant ATP binding Lysine (K) 550), EAW92506, and EAW92507 \n\n (as of November 9, 2007). Specific examples of Mer receptor amino acid sequences include, but are not limited to Genbank Accession Nos. AAK54121, AAI 14918 (invariant ATP binding Lysine (K) 443), and AAI 14918 (as of November 9, 2007). The invariant ATP binding site Lysine (K) is located in the sequence VAVKTM.\n\n\nIn some examples, small molecule inhibitors that bind to an intracellular kinase domain (such as an ATP binding site) of Tyro3, AxI, or Mer, can be used to decrease the biological activity of a TAM receptor in a cell. In particular examples, the small molecule inhibitor is membrane permeable. In some examples, a TAM receptor inhibitor is a triazole compound or derivative thereof, such as an inhibitor of AxI catalytic activity (particular examples can be found in US Patent Publication Nos. 20070213375 and 20080153815, both herein incorporated by reference). Several small molecule TAM receptor inhibitors are known, for instance AXL-I, AXL-2, AXL-3, AXL-4, AXL-5, AXL-6, AXL-7, AXL-8, AXL-9, MP470, and SGI-AXL-277. Other small molecule TAM receptor inhibitors can be obtained, for example, from Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Francisco, CA and SuperGen, Inc., Dublin, CA. Other specific examples of TAM receptor inhibitors can be found in PCT Publication Nos: WO07030680A3, WO06052936A3, WO04092735A3, WO07056151A2, and U.S. Patent Publication No: US20070142402 (all hereby incorporated by reference). In some examples, the AXL inhibitor is a triazole derivative. Examples of AXL inhibitors are disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication 2007/0213375, filed September 13, 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In certain examples, the AXL inhibitor is a triazole derivative with one of the following general structures: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNH? or\n\n\no\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein R can be H or CH\n3\n.\n\n\nIn addition to the known TAM receptor inhibitors, higher potency inhibitors can be generated by chemical modification of the existing inhibitors. For instance, the known compounds generally work in the low micromolar range, however chemical modification makes them, in some embodiments, more potent and more specific. In one embodiment, QSAR analysis is performed using the solved Kinase Domain Crystal Structure of MERTK. AxI and Tyro3 kinases also may be modeled upon this crystal structure (see, for instance, Walker, Huang,\n\n\nFinerty Jr., Weigelt, Sundstrom, Arrowsmith, Edwards, Bochkarev, Dhe-Paganon, Human Proto-oncogene Tyro sine-protein Kinase MER (available on the world wide web at www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore. do?structureId=3BRB-; PDB (protein data base) 2P0C). These more potent compositions will have lower IC50 values. 2. Antibodies\n\n\nIn some embodiments, a TAM receptor inhibitor is an anti- Mer, anti- Tyro3, or anti- AxI antibody, for instance, an anti-human Mer, Tyro3, or AxI monoclonal antibody. Examples of anti-TAM receptor antibodies can be found in, for example, Varnum et al, (1995) Nature, 373: 623-626, and Gallicchio et al., (2005) Blood, Vol. 105, No. 5, pp. 1970-1976. Anti-TAM receptor antibodies can be obtained from Novartis Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland. The antibodies encompassed by the present disclosure include any antibody that selectively binds to a conserved binding surface or epitope of a Tyro3, AxI, or Mer protein, for instance, a conserved binding surface or epitope in the extracellular \n\n domain of a Tyro3, AxI, or Mer protein, or an antibody that is able to bind to a TAM receptor ligand (e.g., Gas6 or Protein S) and impair the interaction between the ligand and the TAM receptor. An \"epitope\" of a given protein or peptide or other molecule is a part of or a site on a larger molecule to which an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof will bind, and against which an antibody will be produced. An epitope can be defined by both the amino acid residues involved in antibody binding and also by their conformation in three dimensional space (for instance, a conformational epitope or the conserved binding surface). An epitope can be included in peptides as small as about 4-6 amino acid residues, or can be included in larger segments of a protein (e.g., 7-12 amino acids), and need not be comprised of contiguous amino acid residues when referring to a three dimensional structure of an epitope, particularly with regard to an antibody-binding epitope. For example, an epitope of an extracellular domain of a TAM receptor or a TAM ligand can be used to generate antibodies useful for the disclosed methods. Antibody-binding epitopes are frequently conformational epitopes rather than a sequential epitopes, or in other words, an epitope defined by amino acid residues arrayed in three dimensions on the surface of a protein or polypeptide to which an antibody binds.\n\n\nDisclosed TAM receptor inhibitors include antibodies. The term \"antibody\" refers to an immunoglobulin molecule (or combinations thereof) that specifically binds to, or is immunologically reactive with, a particular antigen, and includes polyclonal, monoclonal, genetically engineered and otherwise modified forms of antibodies, including but not limited to chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, heteroconjugate antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, and tetrabodies), single chain Fv antibodies (scFv), polypeptides that contain at least a portion of an immunoglobulin that is sufficient to confer specific antigen binding to the polypeptide, and antigen binding fragments of antibodies. Antibody fragments include proteolytic antibody fragments [such as F(ab')2 fragments, Fab' fragments, Fab '-SH fragments, Fab fragments, Fv, and rlgG], recombinant antibody fragments (such as sFv fragments, dsFv fragments, bispecific sFv fragments, bispecific dsFv fragments, diabodies, and triabodies), complementarity determining region (CDR) fragments, camelid antibodies (see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,015,695; 6,005,079; 5,874,541; 5,840,526; 5,800,988; and 5,759,808), and antibodies produced by cartilaginous and bony \n\n fishes and isolated binding domains thereof (see, for example, International Patent Application No. WO03014161).\n\n\nA Fab fragment is a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CHl domains; a F(ab')\n2\n fragment is a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; an Fd fragment consists of the VH and CHI domains; an Fv fragment consists of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody; and a d Ab fragment consists of a VH domain (see, e.g., Ward et al, Nature 341 :544-546, 1989). A single-chain antibody (scFv) is an antibody in which a VL and VH region are paired to form a monovalent molecule via a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain (see, e.g., Bird et al, Science, 242: 423-426, 1988; Huston et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:5879-5883, 1988). Diabodies are bivalent, bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites (see, e.g., Holliger et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448, 1993; Poljak et α/., Structure, 2: 1121-1123, 1994). A chimeric antibody is an antibody that contains one or more regions from one antibody and one or more regions from one or more other antibodies. An antibody may have one or more binding sites. If there is more than one binding site, the binding sites may be identical to one another or may be different. For instance, a naturally occurring immunoglobulin has two identical binding sites, a single-chain antibody or Fab fragment has one binding site, while a \"bispecific\" or \"bifunctional\" antibody has two different binding sites. As used herein, the term \"selectively binds to\" refers to the specific binding of one protein to another (for instance, an antibody, fragment thereof, or binding partner to an antigen), wherein the level of binding, as measured by any standard assay (for example, an immunoassay), is statistically significantly higher than the background control for the assay. For example, when performing an immunoassay, controls typically include a reaction well/tube that contain antibody or antigen binding fragment alone (for instance, in the absence of antigen), wherein an amount of reactivity (for instance, non-specific binding to the well) by the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof in the absence of the antigen is considered to be background. \n\n In some examples, an antibody specifically binds to the extracellular domain of a TAM receptor (e.g., Tyro3, AxI, or Mer) or ligand thereof (e. g. , Gas6 or Protein S) with a binding constant that is at least 10\n3\n M\n\"1\n greater, 10\n4\n M\n\"1\n greater or 10\n5\n M\n\"1\n greater than a binding constant for other molecules in a sample. In some examples, such antibodies (e.g., monoclonal antibody) or fragments thereof has an equilibrium constant (Kd) of 1 nM or less. For example, antibodies that bind to a TAM receptor or ligand thereof with a binding affinity of at least about 0.1 x 10\n\"8\n M, at least about 0.3 x 10\n\"8\nM, at least about 0.5 x 10\n\"8\nM, at least about 0.75 x 10\n\"8\n M, at least about 1.0 x 10\n\"8\nM, at least about 1.3 x 10\n\"8\n M at least about 1.5 x 10\n\"8\nM, or at least about 2.O x 10\n\"8\n M. Kd values can, for example, be determined by competitive ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) or using a surface-plasmon resonance device such as the Biacore TlOO, which is available from Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ.\n\n\nBinding can be measured using a variety of methods standard in the art, including, but not limited to: Western blot, immunoblot, enzyme- linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), immunoprecipitation, surface plasmon resonance, chemiluminescence, fluorescent polarization, phosphorescence, immunohistochemical analysis, matrix-assisted laser desorptionlionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, microcytometry, microarray, microscopy, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), and flow cytometry.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, an anti-TAM receptor antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof is a competitive inhibitor of the binding of a Tyro3, AxI, or Mer ligand (for instance, Gas6 or Protein S). A competitive inhibitor is an inhibitor (for instance, a small molecule inhibitor, antibody, or antigen binding fragment or polypeptide) that binds to Tyro3, AxI, or Mer that is expressed by a cell, and that significantly reduces or inhibits the binding of a Tyro3, AxI, or Mer ligand (for instance, Gas6, Protein S, amino-terminally truncated Gas6, or an amino- terminally truncated Protein S) to the Tyro3, AxI, or Mer that is expressed by the cell. A competitive inhibitor can bind to the target with a greater affinity for the target than the Tyro3, AxI, or Mer ligand. Competition assays can be performed using standard techniques in the art (for instance, competitive ELISA or other binding assays). For example, competitive inhibitors can be detected and \n\n quantified by their ability to inhibit the binding of Tyro3, AxI, or Mer to another, labeled anti-Tyro3, AxI, or Mer antibody or ligand.\n\n\nIsolated antibodies can include serum containing such antibodies, or antibodies that have been purified to varying degrees. Whole antibodies can be polyclonal or monoclonal. Alternatively, functional equivalents of whole antibodies, such as antigen binding fragments in which one or more antibody domains are truncated or absent (for instance, Fv, Fab, Fab', or F(ab)2 fragments), as well as genetically- engineered antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof, including single chain antibodies, humanized antibodies, antibodies that can bind to more than one epitope (for instance, bi-specific antibodies), or antibodies that can bind to one or more different antigens (for instance, bi- or multi-specific antibodies), also can be used.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, an anti-Tyro3, AxI, or Mer antibody (or an antibody to a ligand thereof) is a humanized antibody. Humanized antibodies are molecules having an antigen binding site derived from an immunoglobulin from a non- human species, the remaining immunoglobulin-derived parts of the molecule being derived from a human immunoglobulin. The antigen binding site can include either complete variable regions fused onto human constant domains or only the complementarity determining regions (CDR5) grafted onto appropriate human framework regions in the variable domains. Humanized antibodies can be produced, for example, by modeling the antibody variable domains, and producing the antibodies using genetic engineering techniques, such as CDR grafting. A description various techniques for the production of humanized antibodies can be found, for example, in Morrison et al. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 :6851- 55; Whittle et al. (1987) Prot. Eng. 1 :499-505; Co et al. (1990) J. Immunol.\n\n\n148: 1149-1154; Co et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:2869-2873; Carter et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 89:4285-4289; Routledge et al. (199 Ij Eur. J. Immunol. 21 :2717- 2725 and PCT Patent Publication Nos. WO 91/09967; WO 91/09968 and WO 92/113831. Other embodiments include fully human antibodies. One method to produce such antibodies having a particular binding specificity includes obtaining human antibodies from immune donors (for instance, using EBV transformation of B-cells or by PCR cloning and phage display). In addition, and more typically, synthetic phage libraries have been created that use randomized combinations of \n\n synthetic human antibody V-regions. By selection on the antigen, fully human antibodies can be made in which the V-regions are very human-like in nature. Finally, fully human antibodies can be produced from transgenic mice. Specifically, transgenic mice have been created which have a repertoire of human immunoglobulin germline gene segments. Therefore, when immunized, these mice produce human-like antibodies. All of these methods are known in the art.\n\n\nGenetically engineered antibodies include those produced by standard recombinant DNA techniques involving the manipulation and re- expression of DNA encoding antibody variable and/or constant regions. Particular examples include, chimeric antibodies, where the VH and/or VL domains of the antibody come from a different source as compared to the remainder of the antibody, and CDR grafted antibodies (and antigen binding fragments thereof), in which at least one CDR sequence and optionally at least one variable region framework amino acid is derived from one source, and the remaining portions of the variable and the constant regions (as appropriate) are derived from a different source. Construction of chimeric and CDR-grafted antibodies is described, for example, in European Patent Applications EP-A 0194276, EP- A 0239400, EP- A 0451216 and BP- A0460617. In one embodiment, chimeric antibodies are produced that include antibody variable domains that bind to Tyro3, AxI, or Mer, and fused to these domains is a protein that serves as a second targeting moiety. For example, the targeting moiety can include a protein that is associated with the cell or tissue to be targeted or with a particular system in the animal.\n\n\nMethods of generating antibodies (such as monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies) are well established in the art (for example, see Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, 1988). Generally, in the production of a polyclonal antibody, a suitable experimental animal, such as, for example, a rabbit, a sheep, a hamster, a guinea pig, a mouse, a rat, or a chicken, is exposed to an antigen against which an antibody is desired {e.g., against an extracellular TAM receptor domain or ligand thereof). Typically, an animal is immunized with an effective amount of antigen that is injected into the animal. An effective amount of antigen refers to an amount needed to induce antibody production by the animal. The animal's immune system is then allowed to respond over a pre-determined period of time. The immunization process can be repeated until the immune system is found to be \n\n producing antibodies to the antigen. In order to obtain polyclonal antibodies specific for the antigen, serum is collected from the animal that contains the desired antibodies (or in the case of a chicken, antibody can be collected from the eggs). Such serum is useful as a reagent. Polyclonal antibodies can be further purified from the serum (or eggs) by, for example, treating the serum with ammonium sulfate.\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies can be produced according to the methodology of Kohler & Milstein (Nature 256:495-497, 1975), or using the human B- cell hybridoma method (Kozbor (1984) Immunol, 133:3001; Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp.51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987). For example, B lymphocytes are recovered from the spleen (or any suitable tissue) of an immunized animal and then fused with myeloma cells to obtain a population of hybridoma cells capable of continual growth in suitable culture medium. Hybridomas producing the desired antibody are selected by testing the ability of the antibody produced by the hybridoma to bind to the desired antigen. The hybridomas can be cloned and the antibodies can be produced by and then isolated from the hybridomas. An exemplary method for producing a monoclonal TAM receptor (or TAM receptor ligand) antibody includes (a) administering to an animal an effective amount of a protein or peptide (for instance, a Tyro3, AxI, or Mer extracellular domain or ligand thereof) to produce the antibodies, and (b) recovering the antibodies. As used herein, the term \"monoclonal antibody\" includes chimeric, humanized, and human forms of a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies often are synthesized in the laboratory in pure form by a single clone (population) of cells. These antibodies can be made in large quantities and have a specific affinity for certain target antigens which can be found on the surface of cells.\n\n\nIn one example, monoclonal antibody to a TAM receptor (e.g., an epitope of the extracellular domain) or TAM receptor ligand (or epitope of the ligand) can be prepared from murine hybridomas according to the classical method of Kohler and Milstein (Nature, 256:495, 1975) or derivative methods thereof. In one exemplary method, a mouse (such as Balb/c 6-8 weeks old) are immunized is repetitively inoculated (e.g., 3-6 times) with a few micrograms of the selected peptide or carrier conjugate thereof over a period of a few weeks. In some examples, mice can be injected three times intradermally into the base of the tail on \n\n days 0, 10, and 20 using an insulin syringe with a 28-gauge needle attached. Serum can be drawn on days 30 and 45 for evaluation of the anti-serum titer. The mouse is then sacrificed, and the antibody-producing cells of the spleen isolated. Spleens can be harvested about 80-90 hours after the last cell boost for cell fusion. The spleen cells are fused by means of polyethylene glycol with mouse myeloma cells, and the excess unfused cells destroyed by growth of the system on selective media comprising aminopterin (HAT media). For example, cell fusions of the splenocytes can be performed according to the protocol of Oi and Herzenberg {Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology, Freeman Press, San Francisco, 1980). Splenocytes and SP2/0 cells are mixed, for example at a 4: 1 ratio. The mixed cells are centrifuged and the cell pellet resuspended in polyethylene glycol (such as 40% -50% (w/v) polyethylene glycol) and appropriate medium. The resulting suspension is centrifuged and the cell pellet resuspended in HAT medium, and seeded in 96-well plates at 100 μl/ well (2.5x10\n5\n cells/well) and cultured in a CO\n2\n incubator. On the day after fusion, 100 μl of fresh HAT medium containing 500 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen) is added. On days 4 and 7, half of the spent medium is replaced by fresh HAT medium containing 250 μg/ml geneticin. On day 8, the growth of the hybridoma in each well is checked under a microscope. The successfully fused cells are diluted and aliquots of the dilution placed in wells of a microtiter plate where growth of the culture is continued. Antibody-producing clones are identified by detection of antibody in the supernatant fluid of the wells by immunoassay procedures, such as ELISA, as originally described by Engvall (Enzymol., 70:419, 1980), and derivative methods thereof. For example, mAb production in culture supernatants can be assayed on day 10 by ELISA assay or days 9 and 10 by FACS sorter. Positive clones can be expanded and the specific hybridomas cloned by a limiting dilution method. Selected positive clones can be expanded and their monoclonal antibody product harvested for use.\n\n\nIn another example, an anti-Tyro3, AxI, or Mer (or ligand thereof) monoclonal antibody is produced recombinantly. For example, once a cell line expressing an antibody, for example a hybridoma, has been obtained, it is possible to clone therefrom the cDNA and to identify the variable region genes encoding the desired antibody, including the sequences encoding the CDRs. Then, antibodies and antigen binding fragments can be obtained by preparing one or more replicable expression vectors containing at least the DNA sequence encoding \n\n the variable domain of the antibody heavy or light chain and optionally other DNA sequences encoding remaining portions of the heavy and/or light chains as desired, and transforming/transfecting an appropriate host cell, in which production of the antibody will occur. Suitable expression hosts include bacteria, (for example, an E. coli strain), fungi, (in particular yeasts (for instance, members of the genera Pichia, Saccharomvces, or Kluyverornyces), and mammalian cell lines, (for example, a non-producing myeloma cell line, such as a mouse NSO line, or CHO cells). In order to obtain efficient transcription and translation, the DNA sequence in each vector includes appropriate regulatory sequences, particularly a promoter and leader sequence operably linked to the variable domain sequence. Particular methods for producing antibodies in this way are known and routinely used. For example, basic molecular biology procedures are described by Maniatis et al. {Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, 1989); DNA sequencing can be performed as described in Sanger et al. (PNAS 74, 5463, (1977)) and the Amersham International pic sequencing handbook; and site directed mutagenesis can be carried out according to the method of Kramer et al. (Nucleic Acids Res. 1 : 9441, (1984)) and the Anglian Biotechnology Ltd. handbook. Additionally, there are numerous publications, including patent specifications, detailing techniques suitable for the preparation of antibodies by manipulation of DNA, creation of expression vectors and transformation of appropriate cells, for example, as reviewed by Mountain & Adair in Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Reviews (ed. Tombs, M P, 10, Chapter 1, 1992, Intercept, Andover, UK) and in the aforementioned European Patent Applications.\n\n\nIn another example, monoclonal antibody to a TAM receptor (e.g., an epitope of the extracellular domain) or TAM receptor ligand can be prepared from rabbit hybridomas as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,148,332, 5,675,063, or 4,859,595.\n\n\nIn yet another example, monoclonal antibodies to a TAM receptor (e.g., an epitope of the extracellular domain) or TAM receptor ligand can be prepared by repetitively inoculating a non-human mammal (such as a mouse or rabbit) with one or more plasmids encoding a TAM receptor (e.g., an epitope of the extracellular domain) or TAM receptor ligand (or fragment thereof). For example, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or a vector derived there from, can be manipulated using standard molecular biology methods to include a coding sequence for a \n\n peptide fragment of a TAM receptor (e.g., an epitope of the extracellular domain) or TAM receptor ligand. In one exemplary method, Balb/c mice (6-8 weeks old) are immunized three times with the appropriate plasmid (20 μg in phosphate-buffered saline), and one boost can be given with cells before fusion. Mice can be injected three times intradermally into the base of the tail on days 0, 10, and 20 using an insulin syringe with a 28-gauge needle attached. Serum can be drawn on days 30 and 45 for evaluation of the anti-serum titer. To boost the immunized mice, cells expressing the desired plasmid are injected (for example on day at least 50). These injections can be intravenous and intraperitoneal. Spleens are harvested about 80-90 hours after the last cell boost for cell fusion. Cell fusions of the splenocytes can be performed according to the protocol of Oi and Herzenberg (Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology, Freeman Press, San Francisco, 1980). Splenocytes and SP2/0 cells are mixed, for example at a 4: 1 ratio. The mixed cells are centrifuged and the cell pellet resuspended in polyethylene glycol (such as 40% -50% (w/v) polyethylene glycol) and appropriate medium. The resulting suspension is centrifuged and the cell pellet resuspended in HAT medium, and seeded in 96-well plates at 100 μl/ well (2.5x10\n5\n cells/well) and cultured in a CO\n2\n incubator. On the day after fusion, 100 μl of fresh HAT medium containing 500 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen) is added. On days 4 and 7, half of the spent medium is replaced by fresh HAT medium containing 250 μg/ml geneticin. On day 8, the growth of the hybridoma in each well is checked under a microscope. mAb production in culture supernatants can be assayed on day 10 by ELISA assay or days 9 and 10 by FACS sorter. Positive clones can be expanded and the specific hybridomas cloned by a limiting dilution method. In addition, protocols for producing humanized forms of monoclonal antibodies and fragments of monoclonal antibodies are known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,054,297, 6,407,213, 6,639,055, 6,800,738, and 6,719,971 and U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub. Nos. 2005/0033031, and 2004/0236078). Similarly, methods for producing single chain antibodies have been described and can be useful for the making of TAM receptor inhibitors (see, Buchner et al., Anal. Biochem. 205:263- 270, 1992; Pluckthun, Biotechnology 9:545, 1991; Huse et al., Science 246: 1275, 1989 and Ward et al, Nature 341 :544, 1989).\n\n\nMethods known to those of ordinary skill in the art (such as those described in detail herein, including Section J) can be used to screen such antibodies to \n\n identify those that are TAM receptor inhibitors, in contrast to those that are TAM receptor agonists.\n\n\n3. Inhibitory RNA molecules (RNAi)\n\n\nIn yet another example, TAM receptor inhibitors are siRNAs or other inhibitory RNAs (RNAi) that can decrease or eliminate the biological activity of a TAM receptor, for example by decreasing translation of a TAM receptor or ligand thereof. One of ordinary skill in the art can readily generate siRNAs, which specifically bind to a nucleic acid encoding the TAM receptor (e.g., Tyro3, AxI, or Mer) or ligand thereof (e.g., Gas6 or Protein S). In an example, commercially available kits, such as siRNA molecule synthesizing kits from PROMEGA® (Madison, WI) or AMBION® (Austin, TX) may be used to synthesize siRNA molecules. In another example, siRNAs are obtained from commercial sources, such as from QIAGEN® Inc (Germantown, MD), INVITROGEN® (Carlsbad, CA), AMBION (Austin, TX), DHARMACON® (Lafayette, CO), SIGMA- ALDRICH® (Saint Louis, MO) or OPENBIOSYSTEMS® (Huntsville, AL). siRNAs are double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that can induce gene-specific inhibition of expression are provided. These RNAs are suitable for interference or inhibition of expression of a target TAM receptor and comprise double stranded RNAs of about 15 to about 40 nucleotides (such as 19 to 23 nucleotides) containing a 3' and/or 5' overhang on each strand having a length of 0- to about 5- nucleotides, wherein the sequence of the double stranded RNAs is substantially identical to a portion of a mRNA or transcript of the target TAM receptor or ligand thereof for which interference or inhibition of expression is desired. For example, using TAM receptor nucleic acid sequences known in the art (e.g., see GenBank Accession Nos. NM_006293.2, NM_021913.3, and NM_006343.2 for Tyro3, AxI, and Mer, respectively, sequences of which are herein incorporated by reference), or using Gas6 or Protein S sequences known in the art (see for example, Genbank™ Nos: NM_000820.1 for Gas6 and NM_000313.1 for Protein S) siRNA sequences specific for such sequences can be generated using routine methods. The double stranded RNAs can be formed from complementary ssRNAs or from a single stranded RNA that forms a hairpin or from expression from a DNA vector.\n\n\nIn addition to native RNA molecules, RNA suitable for inhibiting or interfering with the expression of a TAM receptor or ligand thereof include RNA derivatives and analogs. For example, a non-natural linkage between nucleotide \n\n residues can be used, such as a phosphorothioate linkage. The RNA strand can be derivatized with a reactive functional group or a reporter group, such as a fluorophore. Particularly useful derivatives are modified at a terminus or termini of an RNA strand, typically the 3' terminus of the sense strand. For example, the 2'-hydroxyl at the 3' terminus can be readily and selectively derivatized with a variety of groups. Other useful RNA derivatives incorporate nucleotides having modified carbohydrate moieties, such as 2'-O-alkylated residues or 2'-deoxy-2'- halogenated derivatives. Particular examples of such carbohydrate moieties include 2'-O-methyl ribosyl derivatives and 2'-O-fluoro ribosyl derivatives. The RNA bases may also be modified. Any modified base useful for inhibiting or interfering with the expression of a TAM receptor or TAM receptor ligand can be used. For example, halogenated bases, such as 5-bromouracil and 5-iodouracil can be incorporated. The bases can also be alkylated, for example, 7-methylguanosine can be incorporated in place of a guanosine residue. Non-natural bases that yield successful inhibition can also be incorporated.\n\n\nIn certain examples, expression vectors are employed to express the at least one siRNA molecule. For example, siRNA molecules can be expressed within cells from eukaryotic promoters. Those skilled in the art will recognize that any nucleic acid can be expressed in eukaryotic cells using the appropriate DNA/RNA vector. The activity of such nucleic acids can be augmented by their release from the primary transcript by an enzymatic nucleic acid (see, for instance, Draper et al, PCT WO 93/23569, and Sullivan et al, PCT WO 94/02595).\n\n\nIn some examples, siRNA molecules are expressed from transcription units (see for example, Couture et al, 1996, TIG 12:510) inserted into DNA or RNA vectors. The recombinant vectors can be DNA plasmids or viral vectors. siRNA expressing viral vectors can be constructed based on, for example, but not limited to, adeno-associated virus, retrovirus, adenovirus, lentivirus or alphavirus. In another example, pol III based constructs are used to express siRNA nucleic acid molecules (see, for example, Thompson, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,902,880 and 6, 146,886). In another example, an expression vector includes a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one siRNA molecule specifically designed to inhibit the TAM receptor or TAM receptor ligand. In a particular example, the vector contains a sequence(s) encoding both strands of a siRNA molecule comprising a duplex. In another example, the vector also contains sequence(s) encoding a single nucleic \n\n acid molecule that is self-complementary and thus forms a siRNA molecule. Once delivered, the recombinant vectors capable of expressing the siRNA molecules persist in target cells. Alternatively, viral vectors can be used that provide for transient expression of nucleic acid molecules. Such vectors can be repeatedly administered as necessary. Once expressed, the siRNA molecule interacts with the target mRNA and generates an RNAi response.\n\n\n4. Aptamers\n\n\nIn yet another example, TAM receptor inhibitors are aptamers that can decrease or eliminate the biological activity of a TAM receptor. One of ordinary skill in the art can readily generate aptamers specific for a TAM receptor {e.g., Tyro3, AxI, or Mer).\n\n\nAptamers include single-stranded nucleic acid molecules (such as, DNA or RNA) that assume a specific, sequence-dependent shape and binds to a a TAM receptor with high affinity and specificity. Aptamers generally comprise fewer than 100 nucleotides, fewer than 75 nucleotides, or fewer than 50 nucleotides (such as 10 to 100 or 10 to 50 nucleotides). In another embodiment, a TAM receptor inhibitor is a mirror-image aptamer (also called a SPIEGELMER™). Mirror-image aptamers are high-affinity L-enantiomeric nucleic acids (for example, L-ribose or L-2'-deoxyribose units) that display high resistance to enzymatic degradation compared with D-oligonucleotides (such as, aptamers).\n\n\nThe target binding properties of aptamers and mirror-image aptamers are designed by an in vzYrø-selection process starting from a random pool of oligonucleotides, as described for example, in Wlotzka et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 99(13):8898-902, 2002. In another example, an aptamer is a peptide aptamer that binds to a TAM receptor with high affinity and specificity. Peptide aptamers include a peptide loop {e.g., which is specific for a TAM receptor) attached at both ends to a protein scaffold. This double structural constraint greatly increases the binding affinity of the peptide aptamer to levels comparable to an antibody's (nanomolar range). The variable loop length is typically 8 to 20 amino acids {e.g., 8 to 12 amino acids), and the scaffold may be any protein which is stable, soluble, small, and non-toxic {e.g., thioredoxin- A, stefin A triple mutant, green fluorescent protein, eglin C, and cellular transcription factor SpI). Peptide aptamer selection can be made using \n\n different systems, such as the yeast two-hybrid system (e.g., GaW yeast-two-hybrid system) or the LexA interaction trap system.\n\n\nD. TAM receptor agonists TAM receptor agonists include agents that significantly increase the biological activity of a TAM receptor in a cell, for instance an agent that specifically binds to and activates a TAM receptor. For example, a TAM receptor agonist may increase the biological TAM receptor activity by at least 25%, at least 50%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 100%, at least 200%, or even at least 500%. Methods of measuring such activity are known in the art. In some examples, an increase in biological activity is indicated by a increase in expression of Tyro3, AxI, or Mer or combinations thereof (at the DNA, RNA, or protein level). In other examples, an increase in biological activity is indicated by a change in a downstream effect, such an increase in TAM autophosphorylation, decrease in TLR-induced cytokine production, decrease in TLR-induced stimulation of MAP kinase activation, decrease in TLR-induced NF- kB activation, or increase in SOCSl and SOCS 3 expression. Methods of detecting such alternations in expression or activity (which in some examples are quantified) are routine, and can include western blotting, ELISA, flow cytometry, northern blotting, PCR, RT-PCR, and the like.\n\n\nIn some examples, TAM receptor agonists are a Tyro3, AxI, or Mer ligand, such as Gas6 and Protein S, as well as mimetics of such ligands that can activate a TAM receptor. Such agents can therefore substantially increase the interaction between the ligand and the receptor and for example can significantly increase receptor activation, for example by increasing signaling from the receptor and increasing downstream biological effects. Examples of such TAM receptor agonists are recombinant versions of Gas6 or Protein S, such as variant sequences that include insertions, deletions and truncations of such proteins that retain TAM receptor agonist activity. For example, Gas6 is a peptide which is able to activate the TAM receptor and encompasses the mature, pre-, prepro- and pro- forms of Gas6 polypeptide, either purified from a natural source, chemically synthesized or recombinantly produced.\n\n\nWhere the Gas6 or Protein S polypeptide has the amino acid sequence of a ProteinS or Gas6 polypeptide found in nature (such as a human Gas6 or Protein \n\n sequence, e.g., Genbank™ Accession No. NP_000811.1 and NP_000304.2 as of November 7, 2007, respectively), it is referred to herein as a \"native\" regardless of the method by which it is produced {e.g., it can be isolated from an endogenous source of the molecule or produced by synthetic techniques). In some examples, Protein S and Gas6 ligands encompass variants of native sequences, as long as such molecules are functionally active, such as being capable of activating a TAM receptor. Such variants include fragments, such as a human Gas6 or Protein S amino acid sequence in which one or more amino acid residues are added at the N- or C-terminus of, or within, the sequence, one or more amino acid residues are deleted, and optionally substituted by one or more amino acid residues, and derivatives of the above proteins, polypeptides, or fragments thereof, wherein an amino acid residue has been covalently modified so that the resulting product is a non-naturally occurring amino acid. In some examples, 1 to 50, 1 to 20, or 1 to 10 amino acid residues are changed. Such variants may be made synthetically, for example, by site-directed or PCR mutagenesis, or may exist naturally, as in the case of allelic forms and other naturally occurring variants of the translated amino acid sequence that may occur in human and other animal species. In certain examples, a Protein S or Gas6 variant shares at least about 75% (such as at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%) sequence identity with a native Protein S or Gas6 amino acid o rnucleic acid coding sequence after aligning the sequences to provide for maximum homology, as determined, for example, by the Fitch et al, PNAS (USA) 80: 1382-1386 (1983), version of the algorithm described by Needleman et al, J. MoI. Biol. 48:443-453 (1970).\n\n\nExamples of such TAM receptor agonists are recombinant versions of Gas6 or Protein S, such as an amino-terminally truncated Gas6 or Protein S. In particular examples, the recombinant agonist has an amino-terminal truncation that lacks the 'GIa' domain, which corresponds to residues 39-92 (SEQ ID NO: 20) of the human Gas6 sequence (Genbank™ Nos: NM_000820.1; NP_000811.1) and residues 23-85 (SEQ ID NO: 21) of the human ProSl sequence (Genbank™ Nos: NM_000313.1; NP_000304.1). The GIa domain is dispensable for TAM receptor binding and activation, however, therefore recombinant versions of Gas6 and Pro S lacking this domain are potent TAM activators, but do not have side effects relating to blood coagulation. Additional examples of Gas6 or ProS truncations include full or partial deletions of one, two, three, or all four of the EGF domains \n\n of either Gas6 or ProS. In some example, the TAM receptor agonist is a Gas6 or Protein S ligand that does not include a GIa domain nor one or more of the EGF domains. Other exemplary Gas6 mutants that can be used as TAM receptor agonists are provided in U.S. Patent No. 6,255,068 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nIn some examples, TAM receptor agonists bind with high specificity to the TAM receptor extracellular domain. Such agents may substantially increase the interaction between a TAM receptor ligand and the receptor and/or stimulate or increase receptor activation, for example by enhancing signaling from the receptor and increasing downstream biological effects. Examples of such inhibitors can include antibodies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies, for example humanized monoclonal antibodies, and other antibodies and fragments thereof described above) designed to bind to TAM receptor epitopes in order to cross-link the TAM receptors, and thereby activate them through receptor dimerization and cross- phosphorylation, are used as TAM agonists. Such antibodies (as well as fragments thereof) can be obtained from commercial sources or generated as described above for TAM receptor inhibitors, except that antibodies that stimulate the receptor instead of inhibit the receptor would be selected. Methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art (such as those described in detail herein, including Section J) can be used to screen such antibodies to identify those that are TAM receptor inhibitors, in contrast to those that are TAM receptor agonists.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, polymer beads derivatized with phosphatidylserine (PS), or liposomes composed principally of PS, are used as therapeutic TAM receptor agonists. These PS-containing agents bind to the GIa domain of endogenously-produced TAM ligands, which are normally made by macrophages, DCs, and other cells in the body, and thereby stabilize and increase the binding affinity of these endogenous ligands.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, a TAM receptor agonist has an EC50 of less than about 50 μM, for instance, less than about 50 nM, or less than 1 pM. In particular embodiments, a TAM receptor agonist has an EC50 of about 10 μM or 20 μM, 0.05 μM to about 5 μM, 0.1 nM to 20 nM, 1 pM to about 10 μM, or 0.1 pM to 50 pM, and in particular embodiments, a TAM receptor agonist has an EC50 of less than from about 0.005 nM to about 50 nM or from about 0.05 nM to about 50 nM, such as about 50 pM to about 1 nM, or about 1 nM to about 50 nM. For example, a \n\n TAM receptor agonist, including murine recombinant Gas6 and full length murine Protein S, has an EC50 around 50 pM to about 50 nM, such as about 50 pM to about 1 nM or about 1 nM to about 50 nM. In addition to the known TAM receptor agonists, higher potency inhibitors are generated by chemical modification of the existing agonist. For instance, the known compounds generally work in the low micromolar range, however chemical modification makes them, in some embodiments, more potent and more specific. In one embodiment, QSAR analysis is performed using the solved Kinase Domain Crystal Structure of MERTK. AxI and Tyro3 kinases also may be modeled upon this crystal structure (see, for instance, Walker, Huang, Finerty Jr., Weigelt, Sundstrom, Arrowsmith, Edwards, Bochkarev, Dhe-Paganon, Human Proto-oncogene Tyro sine-protein Kinase MER (in press); PDB (protein data base) 2P0C). These more potent compositions will have lower EC50 values.\n\n\nD. Pharmaceutical Compositions including TAM receptor inhibitors or TAM receptor agonists\n\n\nThe TAM receptor inhibitors and TAM receptor agonists used in the methods described herein can be formulated in a variety of ways depending on the location and type of disease to be treated or prevented. Pharmaceutical compositions are thus provided for both local (for instance, topical or inhalational) use and for systemic use. Therefore, the disclosure includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions including at least one TAM receptor inhibitor (e.g., one, two or three TAM receptor inhibitors) or at least one TAM receptor agonist (for instance, one, two or three TAM receptor agonists) formulated for use in human or veterinary medicine. While the TAM receptor inhibitors or TAM receptor agonists typically will be used to treat human subjects, they also can be used to treat similar or identical diseases in other vertebrates, such other primates, dogs, cats, horses, and cows.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions that include at least one TAM receptor inhibitor as described herein as an active ingredient, or that include both a TAM receptor inhibitor and an additional anti-infective agent, vaccine, or anti-cancer agent as active ingredients, can be formulated with an appropriate solid or liquid carrier, depending upon the particular mode of administration chosen. Further, pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one TAM receptor agonist as \n\n described herein as an active ingredient, or that include both a TAM receptor agonist and an additional immunosuppressive agent as an active ingredient, can be formulated with an appropriate solid or liquid carrier, depending upon the particular mode of administration chosen. A suitable administration format can best be determined by a medical practitioner for each subject individually. Various pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and their formulation are described in standard formulation treatises, for instance, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin. See also Wang & Hanson (1988) Journal of Parenteral Science and Technology, Technical Report No. 10, Supp. 42: 2S. The dosage form of the pharmaceutical composition is determined by the mode of administration chosen. For instance, in addition to injectable fluids, inhalational, transdermal, rectal, vaginal, and oral formulations can be employed. Inhalational preparations can include aerosols, particulates, and the like. In general, the goal for particle size for inhalation is about 1 μm or less in order that the pharmaceutical reach the alveolar region of the lung for absorption. Oral formulations can be liquid (for instance, syrups, solutions, or suspensions), or solid (for instance, powders, pills, tablets, or capsules). For solid compositions, conventional non-toxic solid carriers can include pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, or magnesium stearate. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a pharmacological composition is provided that includes at least one TAM receptor inhibitor or TAM receptor agonist and a pharmacologically acceptable carrier. Pharmacologically acceptable carriers (for instance, physiologically or pharmaceutically acceptable carriers) are well known in the art. A suitable pharmacological composition can be formulated to facilitate the use of TAM receptor inhibitors or agonists in vivo. Such a composition can be suitable for delivery of the active ingredient to any suitable host, such as a patient for medical application, and can be manufactured in a manner that is itself known, for instance, by means of conventional mixing dissolving, granulating, dragee- making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilizing processes.\n\n\nThe compositions or pharmaceutical compositions can be administered by any route, including parenteral administration, for example, intravenous, \n\n intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, or intra-articular injection or infusion, or by sublingual, oral, topical, intra-nasal, or transmucosal administration, or by pulmonary inhalation. When TAM receptor inhibitors or agonists are provided as parenteral compositions, for instance, for injection or infusion, they are generally suspended in an aqueous carrier, for example, in an isotonic buffer solution at a pH of about 3.0 to about 8.0, for example at a pH of about 3.5 to about 7.4, 3.5 to 6.0, or 3.5 to about 5.0. Useful buffers include sodium citrate-citric acid and sodium phosphate-phosphoric acid, and sodium acetate/acetic acid buffers. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions that include a\n\n\nTAM receptor inhibitor or agonist can take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (for instance, pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (for instance, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (for instance, magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (for instance, potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (for instance, sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets can be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration can take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they can be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations can be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (for instance, sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (for instance, lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (for instance, almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (for instance, methyl or propyl-p- hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations can also contain buffer salts, flavoring, coloring, and sweetening agents as appropriate.\n\n\nFor administration by inhalation, the TAM receptor inhibitors or agonists for use according to the present disclosure are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, for instance, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit can be determined by \n\n providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator can be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions that include at least one TAM receptor inhibitor or agonist as described herein as an active ingredient normally will be formulated with an appropriate solid or liquid carrier, depending upon the particular mode of administration chosen. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients useful in this disclosure are conventional. For instance, parenteral formulations usually include injectable fluids that are pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluid vehicles such as water, physiological saline, other balanced salt solutions, aqueous dextrose, glycerol or the like. Excipients that can be included are, for instance, proteins, such as human serum albumin or plasma preparations. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered can also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives, and pH buffering agents and the like, for example sodium acetate or sorbitan monolaurate. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nF. Use of TAM receptor inhibitors as adjuvants\n\n\nIn general, the TAM receptor inhibitors described herein can be used in conjunction with any vaccine, for instance, a vaccine that is less than fully protective, that requires one or more booster administrations, or that uses an adjuvant that is less than fully-effective or that has safety concerns. For instance, the current anthrax vaccine (BioThrax) uses an aluminum-based adjuvant, for which there are multiple side effect concerns. Specific, non-limiting examples of other vaccines that use adjuvants that have safety concerns include DTP (diptheria- tetanus-pertussis), Haemophilus influenzae type B, Pneumococcal conjugate, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Human papillomavirus, and Rabies vaccines. Some embodiments of the disclosure are methods of enhancing the immunogenicity of a vaccine. In particular embodiments, the vaccine is a vaccine against a bioterrorism agent. The method includes administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of TAM receptor inhibitor in combination with a vaccine against a bioterrorism agent, thereby enhancing the efficacy of the vaccine. \n\n The vaccine can be a preparation of antigen, DNA, protein subunit, peptide, attenuated microorganisms (including but not limited to bacteria and viruses), living microorganisms, or killed microorganisms, administered for the prevention, amelioration or treatment of a disease. In some embodiments, the vaccine is a heat or formalin-killed vaccine.\n\n\nExamples of heat-killed vaccines in common use today are the typhoid vaccine and the SaIk poliomyelitis vaccine.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the vaccine is an acellular vaccine. Acellular vaccines are made using only the antigenic part of the disease-causing organism, for example the capsule, the flagella, or part of the protein cell wall. In still other embodiments, the vaccine is an attenuated vaccine. Attenuated vaccines are made by \"attenuating\" or weakening a live microorganism by aging it or altering its growth conditions. In still further embodiments, the vaccine is a toxoid.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the vaccine is made from a related, less virulent pathogen. The related pathogen does not cause serious disease, but provides protection from the more virulent pathogen. For example, the relatively mild cowpox virus is used to protect against the similar, but often lethal, smallpox virus. In still further embodiments, the vaccine is a subunit vaccine or a DNA vaccine.\n\n\nThus, one or more TAM receptor inhibitors can be used in conjunction with a wide variety of vaccines, including, but not limited to vaccines for protection from a bioterrorism agent. Specific, non-limiting examples of such vaccines include a heat or formalin-killed vaccine, attenuated vaccine, protein subunit vaccine, antigen vaccine, DNA vaccine, acellular vaccine, or toxoid vaccine directed against Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Variola major, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Ebola virus, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, cobra venom, shellfish toxin, botulinum toxin, saxitoxin, ricin toxin, Shigella flexneri, S. dysenteriae {Shigella bacillus), Salmonella, Staphylococcus enterotoxin B, Histoplasma capsulatum, tricothecene mycotoxin, aflatoxin. The vaccine also can be directed against cryptococcosis, brucellosis (undulant fever), coccidioidomycosis (San Joaquin Valley or desert fever), psittacosis (parrot fever), bubonic plague, tularemia (rabbit fever), malaria, cholera, typhoid, hemorrhagic fever, tick-borne encephalitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, pneumonic plague, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, dengue fever, Rift Valley fever, diphtheria, melioidosis, glanders, tuberculosis, infectious hepatitis, encephalitides, \n\n blastomycosis, nocardiosis, yellow fever, typhus, and Q fever. In some embodiments, the vaccine is an antigen from Bacillus anthracis, Ebola virus, tick- borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Yersinia pestis, Variola major, Histoplasma capsulatum, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, S. dysenteriae {Shigella bacillus), Salmonella, or Staphylococcus.\n\n\nIn particular examples of certain embodiments, the vaccine is an anthrax vaccine, such as, but not limited to AVA, or an anthrax antigen, such as, but not limited to Protective Antigen (PA) or recombinant Protective Antigen (rPA). Primary vaccination with AVA generally consists of three subcutaneous injections at 0, 2, and 4 weeks, and three booster vaccinations at 6, 12, and 18 months. To maintain immunity, the manufacturer recommends an annual booster injection. Because of the complexity of a six-dose primary vaccination schedule and frequency of local injection- site reactions, schedules with a reduced number of doses would be desirable. Administration of AVA in conjunction with a TAM receptor inhibitor provides a better immune response to the vaccine than use of the vaccine alone, and can result in a decreased frequency of immunizations required to attain an immune protective response.\n\n\nIn particular, non-limiting examples, the vaccine is a DNA sequence encoding the non-toxic protective antigen (PA) from B. anthracis or an immunogenic fragment thereof. The sequence for PA has been determined and has been deposited in GenBank at Accession No. M22589. Other antigens of use include, but are not limited to, B. anthracis lethal factor or an immunogenic fragment thereof, disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No: 2002/0051791 Al, hantavirus antigens, for example those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,614,193, smallpox antigens, for example those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,567,147, plague antigens, for example those disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO9824912A2, Ebola virus antigens, for example those disclosed in PCT Publication No WO0000617A2, tick-borne encephalitis antigens, for example those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,372,221 and European Patent Publication EP0691404B1, Histoplasma capsulatum antigens, for example those disclosed in PCT Publication No WO9955874A2 and U.S. Patent No. 6,391,313, Haemophilus influenzae antigens, for example those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,342,232, and European Patent Publication EP0432220B1, E. coli antigens, for example those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,370,872, 6,077,516, and 3,975,517, Shigella \n\n antigens, for example those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,077,044, 5,686,580, and 5,681,736, Salmonella antigens, for example those disclosed in PCT Publication No WO0170247A2, U.S. Patent Publication No. US20010021386A1, and European Patent Publication EPl 112747 Al, and Staphylococcus antigens, for example those disclosed in European Patent Publication EP0694309A3 and U.S. Patent No. 6,391,315.\n\n\nThe method includes administering a therapeutically effective amount of a TAM receptor inhibitor to a subject in conjunction with a vaccine, for instance a vaccine against a bioterrorism agent, thereby enhancing the immunogenicity of the vaccine. In one embodiment, the TAM receptor inhibitor is administered locally, such as topically or by inhalation. In another embodiment, the TAM receptor inhibitor is administered systemically, such as by intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, or subcutaneous injection.\n\n\nAn effective amount of a TAM receptor inhibitor can be administered in combination with a vaccine in a single dose, or in multiple doses. For example, in some embodiments, boosters of the vaccine and TAM receptor inhibitor can be administered periodically after the initial administration, for example, at one month, two months, or three months after the initial administration. In specific, non-limiting examples, pulse doses of a TAM receptor inhibitor, in combination with a vaccine, are administered at 2 weeks, four weeks, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, or yearly after the initial bolus administration.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, a subject who likely has been exposed to an infectious agent can receive a vaccine against the infectious agent in conjunction with a TAM receptor inhibitor and an anti-infective agent. For example, during a course of treatment of a subject who has been, or is likely to have been exposed to an infectious agent, the vaccine and TAM receptor inhibitor can be administered daily, weekly, or every two weeks.\n\n\nTAM receptor inhibitors can be administered before vaccine administration, concurrently with vaccine administration, or after vaccine administration. For example, the TAM receptor inhibitor can be administered before the vaccine is administered, for instance, two weeks, one week, one day, or one hour before the vaccine is administered to the subject. Alternatively, the TAM receptor inhibitor can be administered concurrently with vaccine administration, \n\n or, for instance, two weeks, one week, one day, or one hour after the vaccine is administered to the subject.\n\n\nThus, the TAM receptor inhibitors described herein can be administered to a subject in combination with a vaccine in order to enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccine. The effectiveness of the TAM receptor inhibitor administration can be measured by monitoring vaccine titer or avidity of antibody response, or cytotoxic T cell response, by methods known to one of skill in the art. For example, an increase in vaccine titer or avidity of antibody response over time is an indicator of efficacy of TAM receptor inhibitor treatment. In another embodiment, the TAM receptor inhibitor is used in conjunction with a dendritic cell-based vaccine, for example a tumor vaccine, for instance in order to boost the resulting immune response and overcome the characteristic immunesuppression of tumor-associated DCs. Tumor vaccines are used for the treatment of various cancers, including melanoma and lymphoproliferative disorders, such as different types of leukemias, lymphomas and myelomas. A major challenge in developing effective DC vaccines that induce a strong T-cell mediated immunity against tumors relies on the generation of immunopotent DCs. Enhanced efficacy of immune-based strategies could be achieved using TAM inhibitors. Briefly, in a dendritic cell-based vaccine protocol, DCs are isolated from a subject with a tumor, and the cells are contacted with a tumor-associated antigen or transfected with a vector ex vivo. The cells are then reintroduced into the subject's body, where they initiate an immune response against the tumor. The use of DC vaccines as treatments for subjects with malignancies and chronic infectious diseases is well known (Paczesny et al, (2003) Semin. Cancer Biol. 13 :439; Gandhi et ah, (2002) Annu Rev. Med. 53 : 149). Following activation by inflammatory cytokines or microbial products, DCs possess several characteristics that are implicated in the efficient stimulation of tumor-specific T lymphocytes, including enhanced homing to lymphoid tissues, high level expression of MHC class I- and II molecules in conjunction with costimulatory molecules, and secretion of immunostimulatory cytokines (Banchereau et ah, (1998) Nature 392:245). The ability of DCs to prime tumor-specific T cell responses has been demonstrated in various animal models (Flamand et ah, (1994) Eur. J. Immunol. 24:605; Mayordomo et ah, (1995) Nat. Med. 1 : 1297; Celluzzi et al, (1996) J. Exp. \n\n Med. 183:283). These studies have led to several clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of DCs loaded ex vivo with tumor-associated antigens to initiate protective immune responses in cancer patients (Stift et ah, (2003) J. Clin. Oncol. 2 1 : 135; Kono et ah, (2002) Clin. Cancer Res. 8:3394; Murphy et ah, (1999) Prostate 38:37; Fong et ah, (2001) J. Immunol. 166:4254; Dees et ah, (2004) Cancer Immunol. Immunother 53:111; Chang et a (2002) Clin. Cancer Res. 8: 1021 ; Banchereau et ah, (2001) Cancer Res. 6 1 :6451 ).\n\n\nDendritic cells can be obtained from a subject (for instance, a cancer patient or a person at risk for cancer), and then the DC are loaded with a tumor-associated antigen ex vivo, and then introduced back into the subject. Alternatively, a cell from which a DC can be derived (for instance, monocytes or CD34+ bone marrow progenitor cells) is obtained from the subject, DC are derived therefrom, and then modified by loading with the antigen and administered to the subject as described above. Alternatively, the cell (a DC cell or precursor thereof) can be obtained from a donor subject, modified, and then introduced into a recipient subject. If the DC is not from (or derived from) the recipient, it is desirable that the DC is HLA compatible with the recipient.\n\n\nOne particular method of deriving human DCs is from monocytes. Blood can be obtained from a human subject, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, isolated, cultured in medium containing granulocyte-macrophage colony- stimulating factor, and/or interleukin 4 (IL-4) for a suitable time. For example, cells can be harvested after approximately 4-14 days as immature DCs, or can be induced to mature, for instance, after further incubation in the presence of lipopolysaccharide and/or tumor necrosis factor-α for from about 12 or 24 hours to about 1, 2, 3 or 4 days.\n\n\nMultiple techniques have been employed for loading DCs with tumor- associated antigens, including pulsing with MHC class I- and/or II-restricted peptides (Thurner et ah, (1999) J. Exp. Med. 190: 1669; Nestle et ah, (1998) Nat. Med. 4:328; Schuler-Thurner et ah, (2002) J Exp. Med. 195: 1279), incubation with tumor cell lysates (Nestle et ah, (1998) Nat. Med. 4:328), and electroporation with tumor cell RNA (Heiser et ah, (2002) J. Clin. Invest. 109:409). In one embodiment, the loading of the DC with tumor-associated antigens is enhanced by carrying out the loading steps in the presence of a TAM receptor inhibitor. For instance, in one specific example, an effective amount of a TAM receptor inhibitor \n\n is added to the DC culture medium prior to, during, or after exposing the DC to antigen.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a TAM receptor inhibitor is used to enhance an immune response in the subject when the DCs are reintroduced into the subject. In one embodiment, the cells are then reintroduced into the subject in conjunction with an effective amount of a TAM receptor inhibitor. As described above for other types of vaccines, the TAM receptor inhibitor can be administered locally or systemically, such as by intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, or subcutaneous injection. The TAM receptor inhibitor can be administered in a single dose, or in multiple doses. For example, in some embodiments, the TAM receptor inhibitor can be administered periodically after the initial administration, for example, days, weeks, or months after the initial administration. Administration of the TAM receptor inhibitor can occur prior to reintroduction of the DCs, substantially contemporaneously with reintroduction of the DCs, or after reintroduction of the DCs.\n\n\nFurthermore, tumors have been shown to produce various factors that induce suppression of tumor associated DCs. The TAM receptors and their ligands often are highly expressed in tumor samples. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that increased TAM signaling may lead to tumor progression due to the intrinsic oncogenic potential of this RTK family, as well as the induction of pathological tumor tolerance through the inhibition of DCs. The use of TAM inhibitors in this setting constitutes a novel therapeutic approach to cancer treatments.\n\n\nG. Methods of treating sepsis with a TAM receptor inhibitor\n\n\nAs described herein, TAM receptor inhibitors are useful for the treatment of sepsis. Sepsis is a serious medical condition characterized by a whole-body inflammatory state caused by infection. Such an infection can be caused by pathogenic gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, fungi, yeast, or polymicrobial organisms. Sepsis is characterized by several distinct stages including, but not limited to, the onset of sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction associated with the end stages of sepsis. TAM receptor inhibitors generally are most effective when used after the early stages of sepsis, for instance, when the subject's condition progresses to \"severe sepsis\" or \n\n beyond. The signs and symptoms of severe sepsis can be subtle. Infection and associated organ dysfunction are two requirements for a diagnosis of severe sepsis, but other clinical indicators also can point to the development of severe sepsis. For instance, subjects in whom severe sepsis should be suspected include ICU patients receiving anti-infectives, subjects with severe community-acquired pneumonia, subjects who have had intra-abdominal surgery, subjects with meningitis, subjects with chronic diseases (including diabetes, heart failure, chronic renal failure, and hepatitis), subjects with compromised immune status (HIV/ AIDS, use of cytotoxic and immunosuppressive agents, malignant neoplasms, and alcoholism), subjects with cellulitis, subjects with peritonitis, and subjects with a urinary tract infection. In children, sepsis can accompany infection of the bone (osteomyelitis). In hospitalized patients, common sites of infection include intravenous lines, surgical wounds, surgical drains, and sites of skin breakdown known as decubitus ulcers or bedsores. The infection is often confirmed by a positive blood culture, though blood cultures can be negative in individuals who have been receiving antibiotics. In some instances, a change in mental status and hyperventilation can be the earliest signs of impending sepsis. Other signs of impending sepsis include fever or hypothermia, hyperventilation, chills, shaking, warm skin, skin rash, rapid heart beat, confusion or delirium, and decreased urine output. Test results that are indicative of sepsis include a low or high white blood cell count, a low platelet count, a blood culture that is positive for bacteria, blood gases that reveal acidosis, abnormal kidney function tests (early in the course of disease), a peripheral smear that demonstrates a low platelet count and destruction of red blood cells, elevated fibrin degradation products, and a blood differential with immature white blood cells.\n\n\nThe later stages of sepsis are characterized by organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion abnormalities, and sepsis-induced hypotension. Hypoperfusion abnormalities include, but are not limited to, lactic acidosis, oliguria, or an acute alteration in mental status. Hypotension is defined by a systolic arterial pressure below 90 mm Hg (or, in children, below normal for their age), a MAP below 60, or a reduction in systolic blood pressure of greater than 40 mm Hg from baseline, despite adequate volume resuscitation, in the absence of other causes for hypotension. \n\n The traditional therapy for sepsis includes antibiotics, surgical drainage of infected fluid collections, fluid replacement, and appropriate support for organ dysfunction, for instance, hemodialysis in kidney failure, mechanical ventilation in pulmonary dysfunction, transfusion of blood products, and drug and fluid therapy for circulatory failure. Patients who succumb to sepsis typically do so due to immunosuppression that occurs in the later stages of sepsis, for instance during sever sepsis and beyond. Previous exposure to the LPS of gram- negative bacteria, for example, leads to a decreased capacity to respond to subsequent challenges, and the immune system eventually shuts down in the face of infection (Cook et ah, (2004) Nat Immunol. 5(10):975-9). Multiorgan dysfunction can be caused, at least in part, by a shift from the inflammatory stage of sepsis to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. In advanced sepsis, activated helper cells evolve from a ThI phenotype, producing proinflammatory cytokines, to a Th2 phenotype, producing antiinflammatory cytokines. In addition, apoptosis of circulation and tissue lymphocytes (B cells and CD4+ T cells) contributes to immunosuppression\n\n\n(Russell, (2006) NEnglJMed, 355: 16). In addition, SOCS levels are maximal in advanced sepsis. It is at this point in the development of sepsis that administration of TAM receptor inhibitors is most beneficial.\n\n\nThus, disclosed in one embodiment is a method of treating sepsis that involves administering a therapeutically effective amount of a TAM receptor inhibitor to a subject in need of immunoenhancement, for instance a subject with advanced sepsis, thereby treating the sepsis. In one embodiment, the TAM receptor inhibitor is administered systemically, such as by intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, or subcutaneous injection. In some examples, subjects are screened to determine if they have sepsis prior to administration of the TAM receptor inhibitor.\n\n\nAn effective amount of a TAM receptor inhibitor can be administered in a single dose, or in multiple doses. For example, in some embodiments, a TAM receptor inhibitor is administered periodically after the initial administration, for example, twice a day or more. In other embodiments, a TAM receptor inhibitor is administered as a continuous infusion. In still other embodiments, for a subject who is suffering from advanced sepsis, a TAM receptor inhibitor is administered in conjunction with one or more anti-infectious agents. Specific, non-limiting examples of suitable anti-infectious agents include anti-fungal compounds, anti- \n\n viral compounds, and antibiotics. Antibiotics include, but are not limited to, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, cefuroxime, cephalexin ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, metronidazole, terbinafine, levofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, tetracycline, and azithromycin. Anti-fungal compounds, include, but are not limited to, clotrimazole, butenafine, butoconazole, ciclopirox, clioquinol, clioquinol, clotrimazole, econazole, fluconazole, flucytosine, griseofulvin, haloprogin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, naftifine, nystatin, oxiconazole, sulconazole, terbinafine, terconazole, tioconazole, and tolnaftate. Anti-viral compounds, include, but are not limited to, zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, abacavir, tenofovir, nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, amprenavir, and lopinavir. Anti-infectious agents also include hyper-immune globulin. Hyperimmune globulin is gamma globulin isolated from a donor, or from a pool of donors, that have been immunized with a substance of interest. Specifically, hyper-immune globulin is antibody purified from a donor who was repeatedly vaccinated against a pathogen. TAM receptor inhibitors can be administered before administration of the anti-infectious agent, concurrently with administration of the anti-infectious agent, or after administration of the anti-infectious agent.\n\n\nH. Use of TAM receptor inhibitors in immunocompromised subjects\n\n\nAnother method disclosed herein is a method of using one or more TAM receptor inhibitors for increasing an immune response to an opportunistic infection in an immunocompromised subject. In some examples, administration of a TAM receptor inhibitor at a therapeutic dose treats the opportunistic infection. Immunocompromised subjects are more susceptible to opportunistic infections, for example viral, fungal, protozoan, or bacterial infections, prion diseases, and certain neoplasms. Those who can be considered to be immunocompromised include, but are not limited to, subjects with AIDS (or HIV positive), subjects with severe combined immune deficiency (SCID), diabetics, subjects who have had transplants and who are taking immunosuppressives, and those who are receiving chemotherapy for cancer. Immunocompromised individuals also include subjects with most forms of cancer (other than skin cancer), sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, those who do not have a spleen, subjects with end stage kidney disease (dialysis), and those who have been taking corticosteroids on a frequent basis by \n\n pill or injection within the last year. Subjects with severe liver, lung, or heart disease also can be immunocompromised.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the immunocompromised subject is infected with a lentivirus. Lentiviruses include, but are not limited to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-I), human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2), simian immunodeficiency virus agm (SIVagm), simian immunodeficiency virus mnd (SIVmnd), simian immunodeficiency virus syk (SIVsyk), simian immunodeficiency virus col (SIVcol), Visna-Maedi virus (VMV), bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV), and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). In some embodiments, the lentivirus is human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-I). In some embodiments, the lentivirus is human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the opportunistic infection is infection with Leishmania major. In other embodiments, the opportunistic infection is a bacterial infection such as salmonellosis, syphilis, neurosyphilis, turberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infection, or bacillary angiomatosis (cat scratch disease); a fungal infection such as aspergillosis, candidiasis (thrush, yeast infection), coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcal meningitis, or histoplasmosis; a protozoal infection such as cryptosporidiosis, isosporiasis, microsporidiosis, Pneumocystis Carinii pneumonia (PCP), or toxoplasmosis; a viral infection such as Cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis, herpes simplex (HSV, genital herpes), herpes zoster (HZV, shingles), human papiloma virus (HPV, genital warts, cervical cancer), Molluscum Contagiosum, oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL), or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML); or a neoplasm, such as Kaposi's sarcoma, systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), or primary CNS lymphoma, among others.\n\n\nIn order to increase an immune response to an opportunistic infection in a subject, a therapeutically effective amount of a TAM receptor inhibitor is administered to the subject. In one embodiment, the TAM receptor inhibitor can be administered locally, such as by topical application or intradermal administration. TAM receptor inhibitors can be injected once, for example, or they can be injected in divided doses two or more times, for example monthly, weekly, daily, or 2-4 or more times daily. In other embodiments, the administration of the \n\n TAM receptor inhibitor is systemic. Oral, intravenous, intra-arterial, subcutaneous, intra-peritoneal, intra-muscular, inhalational, and even rectal administration is contemplated.\n\n\nThe present methods also include combinations of the TAM receptor inhibitors disclosed herein with one or more drugs useful in the treatment of an opportunistic infection. For example, the TAM receptor inhibitors disclosed herein can be administered, whether before or after exposure to a virus, in combination with effective doses of other anti-virals, immunomodulators, anti-infectives, or vaccines. The term \"administration\" refers to both concurrent and sequential administration of the active agents.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a combination of TAM receptor inhibitor with one or more agents useful in the treatment of a lentiviral disease is provided. In one specific, non-limiting example, the lentiviral disease is an HIV-I -induced, an HIV- 2-induced, a SIV-induced, or a FIV induced disease. Specific, non-limiting examples of anti-virals include: AL-721 (from Ethigen of Los Angeles, CA), recombinant human interferon beta (from Triton Biosciences of Alameda, CA), Acemannan (from Carrington Labs of Irving, TX), gangiclovir (from Syntex of Palo Alto, CA), didehydrodeoxythymidine or d4T (from Bristol-Myers-Squibb), ELlO (from Elan Corp. of Gainesville, GA), dideoxycytidine or ddC (from Hoffman-LaRoche), Novapren (from Novaferon Labs, Inc. of Akron, OH), zidovudine or AZT (from Burroughs Wellcome), ribavirin (from Viratek of Costa Mesa, CA), alpha interferon and acyclovir (from Burroughs Wellcome), Indinavir (from Merck & Co.), 3TC (from Glaxo Wellcome), Ritonavir (from Abbott), Saquinavir (from Hoffmann-LaRoche), and others. Specific, non-limiting examples of immuno-modulators are AS-IOl\n\n\n(Wyeth-Ayerst Labs.), bropirimine (Upjohn), gamma interferon (Genentech), GM- CSF (Genetics Institute), IL-2 (Cetus or Hoffman-LaRoche), human immune globulin (Cutter Biological), IMREG (from Imreg of New Orleans, LA), SK&F 106528, TNF (Genentech), and soluble TNF receptors (Immunex). Specific, non-limiting examples of some anti-infectious agents used include clindamycin with primaquine (from Upjohn, for the treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia), fluconazlone (from Pfizer for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis or candidiasis), nystatin, pentamidine, trimethaprim-sulfamethoxazole, and many others, as described above. \n\n \"Highly active anti-retroviral therapy\" or \"HAART\" refers to a combination of drugs which, when administered in combination, inhibits a retrovirus from replicating or infecting cells better than any of the drugs individually. In one embodiment, the retrovirus is a human immunodeficiency virus. In one example, a TAM receptor inhibitor is administered in conjunction with a highly active anti-retroviral therapy that includes the administration of 3'axido-3-deoxy-thymidine (AZT) in combination with other agents. Specific, non-limiting examples of agents that can be used in combination in HAART for a human immunodeficiency virus are nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor drugs (NRTI), non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor drugs (NNRTI), viral-entry inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, maturation inhibitors and protease inhibitor drugs (PI). One specific, non-limiting example of HAART used to suppress an HIV infection is a combination of indinavir and efavirenz, a NNRTI. In one embodiment, HAART is a combination of three drugs used for the treatment of an HIV infection, such as the drugs shown in Table 2 below. Examples of three-drug HAART for the treatment of an HIV infection include 1 protease inhibitor from column A plus 2 nucleoside analogs from column B in Table 1. In addition, ritonavir and saquinavir can be used in combination with 1 or 2 nucleoside analogs. As disclosed herein, all of these therapies are enhanced by combining them with administration of TAM receptor inhibitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, other 3- and 4-drug combinations can reduce HIV to very low levels for sustained periods. The combination therapies that are enhanced by TAM receptor inhibitor administration are not limited to the above examples, but include \n\n any effective combination of agents for the treatment of HIV disease (including treatment of AIDS).\n\n\n/. Therapeutic Uses of TAM receptor agonists Methods are disclosed herein for treating or preventing an immune mediated disorder in a subject. In one specific, non-limiting example, the immune mediated disorder is an autoimmune disease. In another specific, non-limiting example, the immune mediated disorder is an allergic reaction. In a further specific, non-limiting example, the immune mediated disorder is transplant rejection (for instance, graft-versus-host disease).\n\n\nAutoimmune diseases include, but are not limited to inflammatory (rheumatoid) arthritis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, pernicious anemia, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), psoriasis, renal, pulmonary, and hepatic fibroses, Addison's disease, type I diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, Sjogren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, Reiter's syndrome, and Grave's disease, among others. Clinical measures of response can be measured for each of these diseases. For example, a reduction in pain, reduction in inflammation of tissues (e.g., joints), improved tissue (kidney) function, improved ability to digest food can serve as indicators of successful immunosuppression.\n\n\nIn particular examples, the method includes administering a therapeutically effective amount of the TAM receptor agonist to a subject having or at risk of developing an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder, thereby treating or preventing the immune-mediated disorder. In one embodiment, the TAM receptor agonist is administered locally, such as by intra-articular injection for rheumatoid arthritis or by topical administration for psoriasis. In another embodiment, the TAM receptor agonist is administered systemically. In one embodiment, the immune-mediated disorder is an autoimmune disease, an allergy, graft-versus-host disease or a disorder associated with a transplant rejection. In particular embodiments, the immune-mediated disorder is inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), psoriasis, renal, pulmonary, or hepatic fibrosis, type I diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, or multiple sclerosis,. \n\n TAM receptor agonist administration can be systemic or local. Local administration of the agonist is performed by methods well known to those skilled in the art. By way of example, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, one method of administration to the knee, hip and/or shoulder of an individual is by intra-articular injection. Alternatively, in another example, for the treatment of psoriasis, a TAM receptor agonist is applied topically as an ointment or cream. In other embodiment, the administration of the TAM receptor agonist is systemic. Oral, intravenous, intra-arterial, subcutaneous, intra-peritoneal, intra-muscular, and even rectal or vaginal administration is contemplated. In other embodiments, the method is a method of treating or preventing an autoimmune disease in a subject that involves contacting immune cells with a TAM receptor agonist ex vivo, and transferring the immune cells to a subject having or at risk of developing an autoimmune disease, thereby treating or preventing the autoimmune disease. Without being bound by theory, these immune cells act to suppress immune activation in a subject. One specific, non- limiting example is dendritic cells. In particular examples, the method is a method of treating graft-versus-host diseases or a transplant rejection. The method of treating transplant rejection includes preventing transplant rejection in a subject at risk of rejecting a transplant and treating transplant rejection in a subject in need thereof. In other examples, a TAM receptor agonist would be administered in vivo, such as within one day following transplant and continue thereafter, potentially for an extended period, such as for at least 3 days, at least 7 days, at least 14 days, at least 30 days as a function of any indications of transplant rejection.\n\n\nIn certain examples, the immune cells, such as dendritic cells, are contacted with a TAM receptor agonist, and subsequently administered to a subject. The immune cells can be delivered alone, in conjunction with a TAM receptor agonist, and/or in conjunction with an additional immunosuppressive agent. The immune cells can be delivered either systemically or locally. In specific, non-limiting examples, the cells are delivered parenterally, intravenously, intra-muscularly, sub- cutaneously, or intra-articularly. Precise, effective quantities of cells can be readily determined by those who are skilled in the art and will depend upon the condition being treated and the therapy being employed. Other agents, such as growth factors or immunosuppressive agents, can be administered in conjunction with the immune cells. \n\n In another embodiment, an additional anti-inflammatory agent or immunosuppressive agent is administered in conjunction with a TAM receptor agonist. The administration of the anti-inflammatory agent or immunosuppressive agent and the TAM receptor agonist can be sequential or simultaneous. In particular examples, the immunosuppressive agent is a non-steroidal antiinflammatory agent, such as diclofenac, diflunisal, etodolac, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, ketoprofen, ketorolac, nabumetone, naproxen, oxaprozin, piroxicam, sulindac, tolmetin, celecoxib, or rofecoxib, a steroid, such as cortisone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, prednisone, or triamcinolone, or an immunosuppressive agent, for example cyclosporin, tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid, or sirolimus.\n\n\nIn particular examples, the immunosuppressive agent is a biological response modifier, such as Kineret® (anakinra), Enbrel® (etanercept), or Remicade® (infliximab), a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), such as Arava® (leflunomide), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), specifically a Cyclo-Oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, such as Celebrex® (celecoxib) and Vioxx® (rofecoxib), or another product, such as Hyalgan® (hyaluronan) and Synvisc® (hylan G-F20).\n\n\nJ. Methods of identifying immunomodulators Other embodiments include methods of screening for immunomodulators, such as TAM receptor inhibitors and TAM receptor agonists. In one embodiment, the method includes contacting a cell expressing a TAM receptor (or one or more receptor binding domains, for instance, the SHBG domain for the ligands and the IgG domains for the receptors) with a test agent, and determining whether the test agent alters TAM receptor activity. Exemplary activities of a TAM receptor inhibitor and a TAM receptor agonist are provided in Table 2. \n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Activities of TAM receptor inhibitors or TAM receptor agonists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some examples, the method is a method of screening for an immunoenhancing agent and determining whether the test agent substantially reduces or inhibits TAM receptor activity. In other examples, the method is a method of screening for an immunosuppressive agent and determining whether the test agent substantially increases TAM receptor activity. The method can include contacting the cell with the test agent and determining whether contacting the cell with the test agent: alters TAM autophosphorylation, TLR-induced cytokine production, TLR-induced stimulation of MAP kinase activation, and/or TLR- induced NF-kB activation, as compared to a control. In this example, a reduction in TAM autophosphorylation, or an increase in TLR-induced cytokine production, TLR-induced stimulation of MAP kinase activation, or TLR-induced NF-kB activation in the presence of the test agent relative to the control level indicates that the test agent inhibits TAM receptor activity, and thus is an immunoenhancer. In other examples, an increase in TAM autophosphorylation, or a decrease in TLR- induced cytokine production, TLR-induced stimulation of MAP kinase activation, or TLR-induced NF-kB activation in the presence of the test agent relative to the control level indicates that the test agent stimulates TAM receptor activity, and thus is an immunosuppressor. \n\n Autophosphorylation assays are well known in the art. In one example, cells expressing a TAM receptor are cultured and treated with test media, for instance, for 20 minutes at 37\n0\nC. Media is aspirated off and cold lysis buffer is added to each sample. The sample is centrifuged to spin down cell nuclei, and the supernatant is mixed with protein A agarose beads and affinity purified anti-TAM receptor antibody, then incubated. Protein A beads are pelleted and washed and separated on Tris-Glycine gels, and transferred (for Western blotting) onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore). The blot is probed with anti-phosphotyrosine as the primary antibody. A substantial decrease in phosphotyrosine labeling relative to control indicates that the test agent is a TAM receptor inhibitor. A control can be a known value indicative of phosphotyrosine labeling in a sample, such as a cell, not treated with a test agent. For example, a decrease in phosphotyrosine by at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90% as compared to such a control indicates that the test agent inhibits TAM receptor activity, and thus the test agent is an immunoenhancer. In contrast, a substantial increase in phosphotyrosine labeling relative to control indicates that the test agent is a TAM receptor agonist. For example, an increase in TAM phosphotyrosine by at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 100%, or at least about 200% as compared to such a control indicates that the test agent activates the TAM receptor and thus is an immunosuppressor.\n\n\nCytokine assays are also well known in the art. For example, cytokine assays are manufactured by Assay Designs, Inc, Ann Arbor, Michigan; AssayGate, Inc., Ijamsville, MD; and Panomics, Inc., Fremont, CA. An increase in TLR- induced cytokine production in the presence of the test agent relative to the control level indicates that the test agent inhibits TAM receptor activity. A control level can be a reference value indicative of the amount of TLR-induced cytokine production in the absence of a test agent or the amount of TLR-induced cytokine production in the absence of a test agent (such as a cell contacted with carrier alone). For example, a substantial increase in TLR-induced cytokine production by at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 100%, or at least about 200% as compared to such a control indicates that \n\n the test agent inhibits TAM receptor activity, and thus the test agent is an immunoenhancer. In contrast, a substantial decrease in TLR-induced cytokine production relative to control indicates that the test agent is a TAM receptor agonist. For example, a decrease in TLR-induced cytokine production by at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90% as compared to such a control indicates that the test agent activates the TAM receptor, and thus the test agent is a immunosuppressor.\n\n\nFurther, MAP kinase activity can be determined by performing MAP kinase assays with kits that are manufactured by, for instance, MDS Analytical Technologies, Sunnyvale, CA; Millipore, Inc., Billerica, MA; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA; and Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA. A substantial increase in MAP kinase activation (such as indicated by an increase in phosphorylation of p38) in the presence of the test agent relative to the control level of MAP kinase activity (such as basal levels of MAP kinase activity) indicates that the test agent inhibits TAM receptor activity. For example, an increase in MAP kinase activation by at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 100%, or at least about 200% as compared to such a control indicates that the test agent inhibits TAM receptor activity and thus the test agent is an immunoenhancer. In contrast, a decrease in MAP kinase activity relative to control indicates that the test agent is a TAM receptor agonist. For example, a substantial decrease in MAP kinase activity by at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90% as compared to such a control indicates that the test agent activates the TAM receptor and thus the test agent is an immunosuppressor.\n\n\nIn still another embodiment, determining whether the test agent modulates TAM receptor activity includes determining TLR-induced NF-kB activation. In this example, a substantial increase in T LR-induced NF-kB activation in the presence of the test agent relative to the control level (such as an increase in TLR- induced NF-kB activation by at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 100%, or at least about 200% as compared \n\n to such a control indicates that the test agent inhibits TAM receptor activity) indicates that the test agent inhibits TAM receptor activity. In contrast, a substantial decrease in TLR-induced NF-kB activation relative to control indicates that the test agent is a TAM receptor agonist and thus the test agent is an immunoenhancer. For example, a substantial decrease in TLR-induced NF-kB activation by at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90% as compared to such a control indicates that the test agent activates the TAM receptor and thus the test agent is an immunosuppressor. Assays for measuring NF-kB activation are known in the art. For instance kits for measuring NF -KB activation are made by Panomics, Inc., Fremont, CA, and Tebu-Bio, Inc., Boechout, Belgium.\n\n\nIn yet still another example, determining whether the test agent inhibits TAM receptor activity includes determining a control level of SOCSl and SOCS 3 expression before contacting the cell with the test agent, contacting the cell with the test agent, and determining whether contacting the cell with the test agent reduces SOCSl and SOCS 3 expression as compared to the control level of SOCSl and SOCS 3 expression. In this example, a reduction in SOCSl and SOCS 3 expression in the presence of the test agent relative to the control level (such as a decrease in SOCSl and/or SOCS 3 expression by at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90% as compared to control indicates that the test agent inhibits TAM receptor activity) indicates that the test agent inhibits TAM receptor activity and that the test agent is an immunoenhancer. In yet even still another example, determining whether the test agent activates the TAM receptor includes determining a control level of SOCSl and SOCS 3 expression before contacting the cell with the test agent, contacting the cell with the test agent, and determining whether contacting the cell with the test agent increases SOCSl and SOCS 3 expression as compared to the control level of SOCSl and SOCS 3 expression. In this example, an increase in SOCSl and SOCS 3 expression in the presence of the test agent relative to the control level (such as an increase in SOCSl and/or SOCS 3 expression by at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 100%, or at least \n\n about 200% as compared to control) indicates that the test agent is a TAM receptor agonist and thus is an immunosuppressor. Methods for measuring SOCS 1/3 expression levels are known. For instance using the Assays-on-Demand Gene Expression assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), total RNA is prepared using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA synthesis is carried out using High-Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to synthesize single- stranded cDNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR is performed together with endogenous control such as eukaryotic 18S rRNA. Relative quantification of the expression of SOCS 1/3 is carried out by normalizing the target gene signals with the 18S endogenous control.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, screening to identify immunomodulators includes determining whether a test agent alters binding of a TAM ligand to a TAM receptor. For example, the method can include contacting a cell expressing a TAM receptor with a test agent, and determining whether the test agent inhibits binding of a ligand (e.g., GAS6 or Protein S) to a TAM receptor. For example, the ligand can be labeled (e.g., with a fluorophore or other detectable label) and incubated with cells expressing a TAM receptor. Bound ligand can be detected using routine method in the art, such as flow cytometry, spectroscopy, and fluorescence microscopy. This assay is cell-based in some embodiments, whereas in other embodiments it is cell-free (for examples, those manufactured by Biacore, Stockholm, Sweden). A substantial decrease in ligand binding relative to control indicates that the test agent is a TAM receptor inhibitor. A control can be a known value indicative of ligand binding in a sample, such as ligand binding to a cell not treated with a test agent. For example, a decrease in ligand binding by at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90% as compared to such a control indicates that the test agent is a TAM receptor inhibitor, and thus the test agent is an immunoenhancer. In contrast, a substantial increase in ligand binding relative to control indicates that the test agent is a TAM receptor agonist. For example, an increase in ligand binding to a TAM receptor by at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least \n\n about 100%, or at least about 200% as compared to such a control indicates that the test agent is a TAM receptor agonist and thus is an immunosuppressor.\n\n\nThe following examples are provided to illustrate certain particular features and/or embodiments.

Peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 680 and anti-mouse IRDye 800 CW obtained from Molecular Probes. \n\n Splenic DC isolation and Bone Marrow (BM) cultures\n\n\nSpleens were removed and incubated with collagenase D (I mg/ml; Roche) for 20 minutes at 37°C. Splenocytes were collected by homogenization through a 100-μm tissue strainer. Cells were resuspended in a Tris-NH\n4\nC1 buffer for 3 minutes to lyse red blood cells. Splenic DCs were isolated using magnetic beads coated with anti-mouse CDl Ic (Miltenyi Biotec).\n\n\nBM cells were isolated from femurs and tibias and incubated at 2x10\n6\n cells per ml in RPMI complete medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin and 50 nM β-mercaptoethanol) containing 100 ng/ml of Flt3L (Amgen) for 8-10 days. At day 8, approximately 90% of the cells were CDl Ic\n+\n, and approximately 60% of these CDl Ic\n+\n cells displayed the phenotype of the splenic CDl Ib\n+\n conventional DC subset, while approximately 20% displayed the phenotype of B220\n+\n plasmacytoid DCs.\n\n\nDC activation assays\n\n\nSplenic DC or BM-DCs (IxIO\n6\n cells/ml) were cultured overnight in serum- free medium (StemSpan, StemCell Technologies Inc.) in the presence of the indicated concentrations of LPS from Salmonella minnesota R595 Re (Alexis), CpG-ODN 1668 (TCCATGACGTTCCGATGCT; SEQ ID NO: 19; Integrated DNA Technologies) or Poly LC (InvivoGen) alone or in the presence of murine recombinant Gas6 (R&D Systems) or murine recombinant Protein S (produced as described in Prasad et al, (2006) MoI Cell Neurosci 33:96-108). Cytokine production was quantified in cell-free supernatants by ELISA (ebioscience for IL- 12, IL-6 and TNFα and PBL-biomedical for IFNα) or by a luciferase assay using a cell line containing an ISRE-responsive element luciferase reporter construct for Type I IFN (Jiang et al, (2005) Nat Immunol 6:565-570).\n\n\nSplenic DCs (IxIO\n6\n cells/ml) or BM-DCs (5xlO\n6\n cells/ml) were cultured in serum- free medium and treated with the indicated concentrations of murine recombinant Gas6, murine recombinant Protein S, the TLR ligands indicated above, recombinant mouse IFNα (PBL Biomedical laboratories), recombinant mouse AxI-FC chimera (R&D), cyclohexamide (Sigma) or Actinomycin D (Sigma). Whole cell lysates and RNA extraction were performed as indicated below. \n\n Immunoblots and Immunoprecipitations\n\n\nDCs were washed in PBS and harvested in NuPage LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) with lOOμM DTT. Whole cell lysates were resolved by electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore), blocked in 3%BSA/TBS-Tween-20 and probed with the indicated antibodies. For fluorescent western blotting with the Odyssey system, proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-FL PVDF membrane (Millipore) and incubated with two primary antibodies in 0.1% casein/PBS-Tween-20. Following incubation with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies, membranes were scanned with the Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR).\n\n\nFor ubiquitylation assays, 5 xlO\n6\n BM-DCs per condition were harvested in PBS containing 1% SDS and boiled for 5 minutes. PBS containing 1% Triton X- 100, ImM DTT, 1 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 5 mM NaF and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche) was added and the mixture was sonicated. Lysates were precleared for 1 hour by incubation with Immobilized rProteinA (RepliGen) and incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4°C. Immobilized rProteinA was added for the last 2 hours. The immunoprecipitates were washed in PBS containing 0.2% NP-40 and 0.5 M LiCl and resuspended and boiled in NuPage LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) with 100 μM DTT.\n\n\nFor co-immunoprecipitation assays, DCs were lysed in 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 2 mM EGTA, 6 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (complete) and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors from Sigma.\n\n\nRNA extraction, reverse transcription and real-time PCR analysis\n\n\nAfter stimulation, cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed according to manufacturer instructions with RT Superscript III (Invitrogen). PCR reactions were performed on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System using SYBRGreen PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). Each reaction was normalized against the expression of β-actin or GAPDH. Analyses of dissociation \n\n curves were performed with SDS software (Applied Biosystems) to ensure the absence of nonspecific amplification. Q-PCR primers used herein are listed below.\n\n\nFlow cytometric analysis Cells were incubated for 15 minutes with a rat mAb to CD 16/32 to block\n\n\nFc receptors and then with primary antibodies for 20 minutes on ice. The following mAbs against murine molecules were used: allophycocyanin- and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD l ie, FITC-conjugated anti-MHC class I (H-2K\nb\n) and anti-MHC class II (I-A\nb\n), PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated anti-CD3, anti-CD19 and anti-NKl. l (all from BD Pharmingen). For AxI staining, cells were processed as described, fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with Saponin (0.1%, Sigma), incubated with AxI (M-20) antibody for 30 minutes and then with anti- goat Cy5 antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Fluorescent cells were acquired with a FacsSort flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with Flow Jo (Tree Star) software.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\n\n\nDifferences between the means of experimental groups were analyzed with a two-tailed Student's t-test. Differences with ap value of 0.05 or less were considered significant.\n\n\nExample 2: Dendritic cell hyper-activation and expansion in TAM triple knock-outs\n\n\nThis Example demonstrates dendritic cell hyper-activation and expansion in TAM triple knock-outs. The immune system phenotypes of TAM TKOs indicated that their autoimmune syndromes might be due to abnormalities in APC physiology (Lu & Lemke (2001) Science 293 : 306-311). Therefore, the status of the DC subset of professional APCs was assessed in TAM TKO spleens. The percentage of splenic CDl lc+ cells was markedly elevated in TAM TKOs relative to wild-type (WT), as was the absolute number of CDl lc+ cells (FIGS. IA, IB). Splenic DCs were also hyperactivated in the triple mutants. CDl lc+ DCs in TAM TKOs expressed higher levels of MHC class I and class II (FIG. 1C), and BAFF/BlyS (FIG. ID), which is elevated in patients with autoimmune diseases such as SLE (Collins et αl, (2006) Arthritis Res Ther 8:R6). \n\n TAM TKO CDl lc+ DCs express super-elevated levels of MHC class II and B7.2 in response to intraperitoneal injection of LPS (Lu & Lemke (2001) Science 293:306-311). These and other indices of immune activation, such as autoantibody titers and splenomegaly, show a gene dosage effect through the TAM mutant series: they are more severe in Tyro 3-/-AxI-/-, Axl-/-Mer-/-, and Tyro S-/- Mer-/- double mutants than in any single mutant, and are most severe in TAM triple mutants (Lu & Lemke (2001) Science 293 : 306-311). In agreement with these earlier observations, splenic DCs isolated from WT, AxI-/-, Mer-/-, or TAM TKO mice show progressive hyper-responsiveness to TLR activation, exhibiting an additive gene dosage effect that is consistent with the co-expression of TAM receptors documented in many cell types (Lu et al, (1999) Nature 398:723-728; Prasad et al, (2006) MoI Cell Neurosci 33 :96-108). In response to the activation of TLR9 with CpG, or TLR4 with LPS, Axl'\n~\n, Me/\n'\n, and TWTKO DCs produced elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-α relative to WT DCs, with the levels produced by triple mutant DCs being highest (FIGS. IE, IF). Activation of TLR3 with poly LC yielded comparable results. The increase in cytokine production in mutant DCs cannot be attributed to a mutation-induced shift in subpopulations of DCs, since the percentage of conventional and plasmacytoid CDl lc+ cells was comparable between WT and mutant splenic DC cultures.\n\n\nExample 3: TAM receptor activation inhibits TLR-induced cytokine production in DCs\n\n\nThis Example demonstrates that TAM receptor agonists inhibit TLR-driven cytokine production in WT DCs. Given the results described in Example 2, it was determined whether treatment with TAM receptor agonists might inhibit TLR- driven cytokine production in WT DCs. Analyses were performed in both splenic CDl lc+ DCs, and in DCs differentiated from mouse bone marrow (BM) in the presence ofFLT-3 ligand (Gilliet et al, (2002) J Exp Med 195:953-958).\n\n\nIn both DC populations, the major TAM receptors expressed were AxI and Mer (FIG. IG), with no detectable Tyro 3. The TAM receptors are activated by the binding of two closely-related, soluble ligands - Gas6 and Protein (ProS; Prasad et al, (2006) MoI Cell Neurosci 33: 96-108; Stitt et al, (1995) Cell 80: 661-670). Overnight (15 hours) co-incubation of recombinant Gas6 with CpG \n\n substantially inhibited TLR9-induced production of Type I IFNs, IL6, and TNFα in wild-type DCs (FIG. IH). TAM inhibition was not limited to TLR9. TLR4 was activated by LPS and TLR3 by poly LC, and a comparable Gas6-mediated inhibition of LPS-induced IL6 and TNFα production (FIG. II), and of poly LC- induced Type I IFN, was also observed (FIG. IJ). DC viability was unaffected by Gas6 treatment, and the inhibitory effect of Gas6 was seen in both BM-DCs and DCs acutely isolated from spleen. Finally, ProS, the second agonist for TAM receptors, was equally effective at inhibiting TLR-induced cytokine production in WT DCs (FIG. 8A). Thus, TAM activation broadly inhibits the production of cytokines induced by the ligation of TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9.\n\n\nExample 4: TAM-mediated inhibition acts on conserved components of TLR signaling pathways and requires new gene expression\n\n\nThis Example demonstrates that TAM-mediated inhibition acts on conserved components of TLR signaling pathways and requires new gene expression. TLR activation leads to the engagement of multiple downstream signaling cascades. ERKl/2 and p38 MAP kinase, for example, are well- characterized effectors that are activated (phosphorylated) by TLR ligation (Dong et al, (2002) Annu Rev Immunol 20: 55-72). Treatment of DCs with 1 μM CpG resulted in the phosphorylation of both p38 (FIG. 2A) and ERKl/2 (FIG. 2B) within 60 minutes, and these activating phosphorylations were completely blocked by 2-hour prior incubation with Gas6 (FIGS. 2A, 2B). TLR signaling also leads to the degradation of the NF -KB inhibitors IκBα/β, and the consequent activation of NF-κB-driven transcription (Hoffmann & Baltimore (2006) Immunol Rev 210: 171-186). Treatment of BM-DCs with CpG led to the degradation of both IκBα and IκBβ beginning at 60 minutes (FIG. 2C), and this degradation was again completely blocked by prior incubation with Gas6 (FIG. 2C). The other TAM ligand, ProS, displayed similar effects in inhibiting CpG-induced phosphorylation of p38 and ERKl/2 (FIG. 8B), and CpG-induced degradation of IκBα and IκBβ (FIGS. 8C, 8D). Thus, TAM activation inhibits conserved components of TLR signaling pathways in DCs.\n\n\nTAM inhibition of these pathways operates downstream of multiple TLRs. Activation of the MAP kinase and NF -KB pathways by TLR3, for example, was also inhibited by prior treatment with Gas6 (FIGS. 9A, 9B). Similarly, activation \n\n of p38 and ERK1/2, as a consequence of TLR4 ligation, was also inhibited by prior incubation with Gas6 (FIGS. 9C, 9D). The TLR9 and TLR3 pathways are classical examples of MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent/TRIF- dependent pathways respectively, and both of these pathways are inhibited by TAM signaling.\n\n\nTAM inhibition of TLR signaling is not an acute process, but rather can require new gene expression and protein synthesis. In the presence of either the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide or the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D, both the kinetics and magnitude of CpG-induced degradation of IκBα and IκBβ were the same, irrespective of the presence or absence of Gas6\n\n\n(FIGS. 9D, 9E). These observations indicate that activation of the TAM receptors results in the induction of one or more genes and proteins that negatively regulate TLR signaling.\n\n\nExample 5: TAM receptor activation induces SOCSl and SOCS3 and inhibits ubiquitylation of the TLR receptor-proximal elements TRAF3/6\n\n\nThis Example demonstrates that TAM receptor activation induces SOCSl and S0CS3 and inhibits ubiquitylation of the TLR receptor-proximal elements TRAF3/6. Several TLR inhibitors have been described (Liew et al, (2005) Nat Rev Immunol 5 :446-458). A candidate-based approach was adopted to test whether any of these negative regulators might be induced in response to TAM receptor activation. The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins function broadly in immune cells as inhibitors of both TLR and cytokine receptor signaling (Frobose et al, (2006) MoI Endocrinol 20: 1587-1596; Mansell et al, (2006) Nat Immunol 7: 148-155; Wormald & Hilton (2007) Curr Opin Hematol 14:9-15; Yoshimura et al, (2005) Arthritis Res Ther 7: 100-110), and are induced in DCs by the cytokine receptor activation that follows TLR ligation. Of particular interest is SOCSl, since SOCSl knock-out mice that are reconstituted for SOCSl expression in lymphocytes display many of the same autoimmune phenotypes as the TAM TKOs (Hanada et al, (2003) Immunity 19:437-450). Both SOCSl and SOCS3 were found to be induced in BM-DCs as a direct consequence of TAM receptor activation (FIG. 3A). SOCS3 mRNA expression increased by 30 minutes after the addition of Gas6, and peak expression (approximately 10-fold) occurred around 90 minutes. SOCSl mRNA expression increased by approximately 10-fold \n\n at 120 minutes. mRNAs encoding six other negative regulators of TLR signaling also were examined - IRAK-M (Kobayashi et al, (2002) Cell 110: 191-202), the inositol phosphatase SHIP (Sly et al, (2004) Immunity 21 :227-239), ATF-3 (Gilchrist et al. (2006) Nature 441 : 173-178), IRF-4 (Negishi et al. (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102: 15989-15994), Triad3 A (Chuang & Ulevitch (2004) Nat Immunol 5:495-502), and Tollip (Zhang & and Ghosh (2002) J Biol Chem. 277:7059-7065). In contrast to SOCSl, none of these mRNAs displayed significant induction following TAM receptor activation (FIG. 3B). Thus, the SOCSl and SOCS3 genes are specifically induced downstream of TAM signaling. The TNF receptor associated factors (TRAFs) are major early signal transducers for both the TNF receptor and the IL-1R/TLR superfamilies, and two of these proteins, TRAF3 and TRAF6, are critical for TLR signaling; they activate the MAPK and NF -KB signaling pathways in DCs (Hacker et al, (2006) Nature 439:204-207). TRAF6 functions as an ubiquitin ligase and is itself activated by ubiquitylation (Deng et al, (2000) Cell 103 :351-361), while TRAF3 shares extensive homology with TRAF6 and also contains a RING-finger domain. Polyubiquitylated forms of both TRAF6 and TRAF3 were readily detected in BM- DCs within 30 minutes after TLR 4 activation with LPS, and this polyubiquitylation is potently inhibited by 2-hour prior incubation with Gas6 (FIGS. 3C, 3D). Thus, TAM-mediated inhibition operates at a receptor proximal point in TLR cascades, eliciting a pleiotropic down-regulation of TLR-activated signaling.\n\n\nExample 6: The IFNAR/STAT1 signaling cassette is an essential effector of TAM-mediated inhibition\n\n\nThis Example demonstrates that STATl is an effector of TAM-mediated TLR inhibition. This example describes methods to demonstrate that STATl mediates the induction of SOCS 1/3 and other TAM-dependent genes. Inactive STAT proteins are classically activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, frequently by the JAK family of tyrosine kinases, in response to interferons, interleukins, and a variety of other extracellular signals (Levy & Darnell (2002) Nat Rev MoI Cell Biol 3 :651-662). This activation results in the translocation of phosphorylated STAT dimers from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they drive the expression of \n\n downstream genes. Phosphorylation of STATl at Y701 is required for STATl transcriptional activation (Shuai et al, (1993) Science 261 : 1744-1746).\n\n\nUsing an antibody specific for phospho-STATl (Y701), it was observed that STATl was activated in DCs following incubation with Gas6 (FIG. 4A). This activation was inhibited by treatment with soluble AxI-Fc, which competes with TAMs for Gas6 binding (FIG. 4B), and was not seen in TAM triple mutant DCs (FIG. 10A). These observations are consistent with a report that a constitutively active and oncogenic form of chicken Mer, designated v-Eyk, stimulates constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of STATl, and that this stimulation requires Eyk kinase activity (Zong et al, (1996) Embo J 154515-4525). Two other members of the STAT family, STAT2 and 3, also were assayed for activation in response to the addition of Gas6 to DC cultures. Using Western blotting with specific phospho-STAT2 and 3 antibodies, TAM-mediated activation of these STATs was not detected (FIG. 10B). In order to assess if STATl is required for TAM inhibition of TLR signaling, the ability of Gas6 to up-regulate SOCSl and SOCS3 expression was assayed in BM-DCs prepared from STATl knock-outs. Gas6-mediated induction of SOCSl mRNA, which is typically approximately 10-fold after 120 minutes in WT DCs, was completely abolished in these STATl\n'\n'\n'\n DCs (FIG. 4C). Gas6 induction of SOCS3 mRNA, while not eliminated entirely, was nonetheless substantially reduced (FIG. 4D). Basal levels of protein and mRNA for AxI, a TAM component in DCs, were comparable between WT and STATl\n' ~\n DCs (see FIGS. 5C, 5D below). The ability of Gas6 to inhibit the expression of a panel of cytokines in response to TLR activation also was assayed in the presence or absence of endogenous STATl. However, most of these cytokines, including IFN- α and IL-12, are themselves almost entirely dependent upon STATl for their TLR- induced activation, since they require a STATl -dependent, cytokine-receptor- mediated amplification step (Gautier et al, (2005) J Exp Med 201 : 1435-1446; Honda et al, (2006) Immunity 25:349-360). Thus, secretion of IFNα and IL12 was not detected in STATl\n'\n'\n'\n DCs in response to LPS and CpG application. However, both LPS- and CpG-triggered expression of IL-6, albeit reduced, were still readily detected in STATl -deficient DCs (FIGS. 4E, 4F).\n\n\nIn contrast to wild-type DCs, the expression of IL6 triggered by LPS (FIG. 4E) or CpG (FIG. 4F) was not inhibited by Gas6 in STATl\n'\n'\n'\n DCs. Indeed, \n\n cytokine production was often slightly elevated by Gas6 treatment in STATF \n'\n DCs (FIGS. 4E, 4F). Together, these results demonstrate that STATl is essential for both TAM-mediated induction of SOCS genes and inhibition of TLR-driven cytokine production in DCs. Not unexpectedly, STATl -dependent SOCS expression is also critical for the inhibition of receptor-proximal steps of TLR cascades. TAM inhibition of LPS-induced TRAF6 ubiquitylation and LPS- induced IκBα degradation were both lost in BM-DCs prepared from STATl'\n'\n mice (FIGS. 1OC, 10D).\n\n\nAs noted above, STAT proteins, including STATl, are typically associated with DC signal transduction cascades downstream of cytokine receptors, most notably the type I IFN receptor. It was determined, therefore, whether the STATl- dependent, TAM-mediated inhibition of inflammation documented above might reflect a broader requirement for signaling by the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR). BM-DCs were prepared from Ifnar knock-outs, which are mutant for the Rl subunit of the α/β receptor and lack all type I signaling, and these mutant cells were assayed for STATl tyrosine phosphorylation in response to Gas6 application. In contrast to wild-type BM-DCs, Ifnaf \n'\n cells were incapable of activating STATl upon TAM receptor activation (FIG. 4G). [This effect was not due to a lack of TAM receptor expression in the IFNAR-deficient DCs, as AxI and Mer were still detected in the mutant cells; and also was not due to any Gas6 induction of type IFN production in wild-type cells, as this was not observed.] In keeping with the loss of Gas6-induced STATl phosphorylation, Gas6 was unable to up-regulate SOCSl expression (FIG. 4H), and unable to inhibit LPS-induced production of IL- 6, in Ifnaf \n'\n DCs (FIG. 41). Consistent with these effects, the Rl chain of the type I IFN receptor and AxI physically associate in BM-DCs, in a TAM-ligand- dependent fashion, and can be reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated (FIG. 4J). These results indicate that TAM inhibition of inflammation in DCs is dependent on the presence of the type I IFN receptor. Thus, TAM receptors employ the IFNAR/STATl signaling cassette, which is initially used to trigger inflammation, to subsequently inhibit inflammation. \n\n Example 7: Regulation of TAM receptor signaling is itself a STATl- dependent feature of the innate immune response\n\n\nThis Example demonstrates that regulation of TAM receptor signaling is itself a STATl -dependent feature of the innate immune response. The above results indicate that TAM receptor signaling broadly inhibits inflammatory responses driven by TLR and cytokine receptor activation. This indicates that the TAM system is not fully engaged at the beginning of the innate immune response and, further, that some feature of the system, for instance, TAM receptor or ligand expression, is up-regulated subsequent to TLR and cytokine receptor activation. Therefore, the expression of AxI, Mer, Gas6, and ProS mRNA and protein was assayed in BM-DCs, which were incubated for varying times with LPS, CpG, or poly LC to activate their respective TLRs. AxI mRNA and protein levels were markedly elevated upon treatment with multiple TLR agonists (FIGS. 5 A, 5B). In contrast, no significant change was detected in Mer, Gas6, or ProS mRNA expression in BM-DCs subsequent to TLR activation. [Although the addition of exogenous TAM ligands consistently stimulates TAM signaling in our DC cultures, both endogenous Gas6 and ProS mRNA were detected in cultures, indicating that in BM-DCs, as in many other cell types, TAM signaling is at least partially autocrine/paracrine (Lu et al., (1999) Nature 398:723-728; Lu & Lemke (2001) Science 293:306-311; Prasad et al, (2006) MoI Cell Neurosci 33:96-108).]\n\n\nThis finding of TLR-driven AxI up-regulation is of interest, given the demonstration that type I IFNs, which are themselves induced downstream of TLR activation and which can in certain settings also be immunosuppressive, also markedly up-regulate AxI expression in macrophages (Sharif et al, (2006) J Exp Med 203 : 1891 - 1901). IFN induction of AxI is required for IFN suppression of TLR- or IgG immune-complex-driven TNFα production, since no suppression is observed in Axl\n\"A\n macrophages (Sharif et al, (2006) J Exp Med 203: 1891-1901). In light of these findings and the results presented in FIGS. 5 A and 5B, it was determined whether AxI up-regulation in response to either TLR ligation or type I IFN treatment is itself dependent on the IFNAR/STATl signaling cassette. This is indeed the case, for both forms of DC stimulation. Splenic DCs were isolated from either wild-type, STATF \n'\n, or Ifnaf \n'\n mice, the cells were treated for varying periods of time with either poly LC or IFNα, and then were assayed for AxI expression by Western blot. Both poly LC and IFNα induced substantial up- \n\n regulation of AxI in WT DCs (FIGS. 5C-5E). In marked contrast, AxI induction following treatment with either poly LC or IFNα was lost in STATF \n'\n DCs (FIGS. 5C, 5D). At the same time, poly LC induction of AxI was also lost in Ifnaf \n'\n DCs (FIG. 5E). Together, these results indicate that the AxI up-regulation detected in response to TLR ligation is due to the induction of type I IFNs following TLR activation, and that it is these cytokines that then induce AxI. Thus, proinflammatory activation of the innate immune response results in the downstream activation of anti-inflammatory TAM signaling.\n\n\nExample 8: TLR, IFNAR/STATl, and TAM signaling are integrated into a cyclic innate immune response\n\n\nThis Example demonstrates that TLR, IFNAR/STATl, and TAM signaling are integrated into a cyclic innate immune response. Given both the results described above and the observation that TAM activation directly induces SOCS genes (FIG. 3A), it was determined whether the well-described induction of these genes in response to type I IFNs and other cytokines (Wormald & Hilton (2007) Curr Opin Hematol 14:9-15; Yoshimura et al, (2005) Arthritis Res Ther 7: 100- 110) depend on TAM signaling. The ability of IFNα to elevate expression of SOCS 1 mRNA was assayed in\n\n\nWT or TAMTKO splenic DCs. Although 300 U/ml IFNα stimulated robust induction of SOCSl mRNA after 2 hours and sustained upregulation up to 6 hours in WT DCs, SOCSl induction was significantly blunted in TAM TKO cells (FIG. 6A). This effect was already evident at 2 hours after the addition of IFNα, but was even more pronounced at later time points, consistent with IFNα upregulation of AxI in wild-type DCs (FIG. 5D; Sharif et al, (2006) JExp Med 203 : 1891-1901). Integrated over the 6-hour time course (FIG. 6A), IFN-treated TMMTKO DCs expressed only -24% of the SOCSl mRNA expressed by IFN-treated WT DCs. mRNA levels for two positive effectors of IFN signaling, IRF-7 and IFI-204, also were assayed in the same RNA samples. In contrast to mRNA for the SOCSl inhibitor, the IFNα-induced mRNA levels for these stimulators of IFN signaling were indistinguishable between WT and TWTKO DCs (FIGS. 6B, 6C).\n\n\nThese observations led to an examination of the potential interaction of IFN receptor and TAM receptor signaling in more detail. Consistent with the above \n\n results and in contrast to the SOCS inhibitors, the IRF-7 and IFI-204 positive effectors were not induced in BM-DCs by direct TAM activation (addition of Gas6 alone; FIG. 6D). More tellingly, addition of Gas6 and IFNα in combination resulted in higher induced levels of SOCSl mRNA than those seen with either ligand alone (FIG. 6D, left bars), whereas the expression of both IRF-7 and IFI- 204 mRNA was markedly lower in BM-DCs treated with Gas6 and IFNα in combination than in cells treated with IFNα alone (FIG. 6D middle and right bars). Thus, TAMs and IFN receptors interact positively to induce the expression of cytokine signaling inhibitors, but interact negatively to inhibit the expression of cytokine signaling stimulators.\n\n\nTaken together, the results of FIGS. 4, 5, and 6 indicate that TAM signaling is induced in a sequential, IFNAR/STATl -dependent fashion subsequent to first TLR and then cytokine receptor activation. This induced TAM signaling, rather than cytokine signaling, accounts for most of the SOCS protein elevation that is seen as a consequence of cytokine receptor activation. This SOCS elevation, which appears to be a major component of TAM-mediated inhibition, depends on the ability of the TAM receptors to hijack the pro-inflammatory IFNAR/STATl signaling cassette to inhibit inflammation. These results indicate that the TAM pathway serves as the terminal component of a tripartite inflammatory cycle, composed of initial inflammation, subsequent cytokine amplification, and then restorative, TAM-mediated inhibition (FIG. 7).\n\n\nExample 9: Summary\n\n\nThis Example summarizes the results described in Examples 2-8, above. The results detailed above demonstrate that TAM activation in DCs inhibits the secretion of a panoply of TLR- and cytokine-receptor-driven cytokines. Thus, both TAM engagement and action are integrated as components of a cycle of inflammation that is initiated by TLR ligation (FIG. 7B). The output of the first stage of this cycle is an initial burst of cytokines. This burst is then amplified via a feed-forward loop through cytokine receptors, a process that is almost entirely dependent on STAT proteins, notably STATl (Gautier et al., (2005) J Exp Med 201, 1435-1446; Honda et al, (2006) Immunity 25, 349-360). In addition to elevated cytokine levels, the data indicate that a key output from this second stage of inflammation is the induction of AxI (FIG. 5D; Sharif et al, (2006) J Exp Med \n\n 203: 1891-1901). The data further indicate that AxI induction by both IFNAR/STAT1 signaling (FIGS. 5D, 5E), and TLR ligation (FIG. 5C), occurs largely through TLR activation of this feed-forward cytokine pathway. The final stage of the proposed inflammatory cycle involves the engagement of TAM signaling, the transcription of SOCS genes, and the pleiotropic inhibition of both cytokine receptor and TLR signaling pathways. In concert with TAM activation, this final inhibitory phase again employs the IFNAR/STATl signaling cassette (FIGS. 4C-4J, 1OC, 10D). As discussed below, the data, and their synthesis in the cycle of FIG. 7, account for several previously described but incompletely understood response phenomena in DCs, and also have implications for the understanding and treatment of human immune system disorders.\n\n\nControl points for TAM inhibition\n\n\nTAM inhibition of TLR signaling is seen in multiple read-outs, and acts at receptor-proximal points in TLR signaling cascades. TLR3-, TLR4-, and TLR9- induced activation of MAP kinases and NF -KB are all markedly reduced upon TAM engagement (FIGS. 2, 8, 9), but so is the TLR-induced ubiquitylation and activation of TRAF6 (FIG. 3C, FIG. 7A). TRAF3 is also required for a response to TLR3 and TLR4 activation (Hacker et al, (2006) Nature 439: 204-207), and since TRAF3 shares extensive homology with TRAF6 and contains a ring-finger domain, TRAF3 ubiquitylation was assayed following LPS treatment. TRAF3 is also poly-ubiquitylated upon TLR4 activation, this had not been demonstrated prior to this disclosure, and that this ubiquitylation is also inhibited by TAM activation (FIG. 3D). TRAF6 and TRAF3 function at the convergence of signaling pathways that are immediately downstream of multiple TLRs (Beutler et ah,\n\n\n(2006) Annu Rev Immunol 24: 353-389; Saha & Cheng (2006) Cell Cycle 5: 804- 807).\n\n\nAt the same time, TAM activation leads to the IFNAR/STATl -dependent appearance of SOCSl and SOCS3 (FIGS. 4C, 4D, 4H). SOCSl has recently been demonstrated to promote the degradation of the TLR4 adaptor protein MAL\n\n\n(Mansell et al., (2006) Nat Immunol ! \n'\n, 148-155), and SOCS3 over-expression has also been reported to inhibit TRAF6 ubiquitylation (Frobose et al., (2006) MoI Endocrinol 20: 1587-1596). Thus SOCSl and SOCS3 are bona fide negative regulators of TLR signaling. \n\n TAM-dependent inhibition is also exerted at the second stage of inflammation. This later inhibitory activity reflects the well-described role that SOCSl and S0CS3 play in the inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway and the attenuation of cytokine receptor signaling (red inhibition in FIG. 7; Wormald & Hilton (2007) Curr Opin Hematol 14: 9-15; Yoshimura et al. , (2005) Arthritis Res Ther 7: 100-110). SOCS activity at this point is also cytokine-receptor-proximal. Thus, TAM-mediated, IFNAR/ST ATI -dependent upregulation of SOCSl and S0CS3 allows for the inhibition of both TLR-proximal signaling events (TRAF3/6 ubiquitylation, MAP kinase, and NF-κB signaling), and the feed-forward amplification of cytokine production through the cytokine receptor/JAK-STAT cascade. This dual activity leads to efficient pleoitropic inhibition of both first and second stage inflammation pathways.\n\n\nSTATl redux It was known that STATl plays a role as a transducer of multiple cytokine receptors, such as the interferon (α/β/γ) and interleukin receptors, in DCs and other APCs (Levy & Darnell (2002) Nat Rev MoI Cell Biol 3,: 651-662). Following cytokine receptor and associated JAK kinase activation, STATl becomes phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus, where it drives the transcription of multiple pro-inflammatory target genes. Among the most prominent of these targets during the second stage of the inflammation cycle are cytokine genes themselves (Gautier et al, (2005) J Exp Med 201 : 1435-1446; Honda et al., (2006) Immunity 25: 349-360). The data disclosed herein demonstrate that an additional target of IFNAR/STAT1 signaling at this time is the AxI gene (FIGS. 5C-E). At the same time that the IFNα signaling cascade is using STATl to amplify the cytokine burst produced at the end of the TLR-driven first stage of inflammation, this cascade is also using the same transcription factor to elevate AxI levels. That is, the seeds of the pathway that will eventually inhibit cytokine production are being sown at the same time that cytokine levels are being amplified, and STATl is used for both of these events.\n\n\nHowever, this is not the end for STATl in inflammation. Both the data disclosed herein (FIGS. 4 A, 4B) and the earlier work of Zong et al. ((1996) Embo J 15: 4515-4525) demonstrate that STATl is also specifically activated (tyrosine phosphorylated) as a consequence of TAM receptor activation. More significantly, \n\n it is demonstrated herein that STATl, in conjunction with the type I IFN receptor, is required for the TAM-mediated induction of SOCSl and S0CS3 (FIGS. 4C, 4D, 4H). The loss of Gas6-stimulated SOCSl induction in STATF \n'\n DCs documented herein cannot be explained by lower basal levels of AxI in the mutant cells, since these levels were in fact comparable between STATl'\n'\n and wild-type cells (FIGS. 5C, 5D). Thus, STATl activation is involved in TAM-mediated up-regulation of SOCSl and S0CS3.\n\n\nPerhaps more remarkable still is the observation that TAM-mediated up- regulation of SOCSl appears to account for the majority of the up-regulation of this protein previously documented in response to type I IFN (Wormald & Hilton (2007) Curr Opin Hematol 14: 9-15). These earlier observations, which have been attributed to a direct, negative feedback loop in which IFN (and other cytokine) receptors are inhibited by the SOCS proteins that are induced by the STATl that these receptors activate, appear instead to reflect a significant indirect effect of IFNα: this cytokine induces AxI, and it is TAM receptors that then induce SOCS. The TAMs use the IFN receptor- S T ATI signaling cassette to do this, and thus hijack a pro-inflammatory pathway to inhibit inflammation. The data disclosed herein (FIG. 4J) indicate that this is achieved by binding of the TAMs to the Rl subunit of the IFN receptor, which associates with the R2 subunit, whose cytoplasmic domain binds STATl. Taken together, these results are consistent with a TAM-mediated subversion of the STATl transcription factor - from immune activator that drives inflammation to immune suppressor that drives expression of the SOCS inhibitors.\n\n\nWhat is different about the STATl that is activated downstream of TAM receptor/cytokine receptor engagement versus that activated solely by cytokine receptors? Without being bound by theory, it is proposed that alternative post- translational modifications of STATl, or alternative recruitment/sequestering of cofactors/repressors such as the Twist proteins (Sharif et ah, (2006) J Exp Med 203: 1891-1901) account for this 'blue STAT/red STAT' dichotomy and the differential activation of STATl target genes following the activation of cytokine receptors (for instance, IRF-7) versus TAM receptors (for instance, SOCSl). In this context, it is important to note that the data disclosed herein indicate that the TAM system and type I IFN receptors clearly interact, both physiologically (FIGS. 6A-6D), and physically (FIG. 4J). Similarly, an equivalent physiological and \n\n physical interaction between AxI and another cytokine receptor - the IL- 15 receptor- has been documented (Caraux et ah, (2006) Nat Immunol 7: 747-754; Budagian et ah, (2005) EMBO J 24: 4260-4270). Without being bound by theory, activation of first a cytokine receptor alone, and then subsequently a TAM receptor/cytokine receptor complex, could have different consequences for both STATl modification and the induction of STATl transcription factor partners.\n\n\nPhysiological implications of the inflammation cycle\n\n\nAs outlined above, the activation of TAM signaling effectively inhibits the innate immune response. This in turn indicates that in the absence of continued TLR activation and subsequent cytokine signaling, components of the TAM pathway, such as AxI, which are up-regulated in their expression or activity during the inflammation cycle, must turn over with a half-life that allows responding cells to return to baseline (gray cell in FIG. 7B). This turnover should in fact be integral to the cycle, since AxI up-regulation is itself dependent on cytokine production and IFNAR/STATl signaling (Sharif et ah, (2006) J Exp Med 203: 1891-1901; FIGS. 5C-5E), which are inhibited by TAM signaling. De-activation of TAM signaling is required if a dendritic cell is to be fully responsive to any subsequent encounter with a new pathogen. At the same time, the cyclic nature of the inflammation response described herein means that if this encounter occurs before the TAM system has had time to wind down, then the TLR response to the new pathogen should be blunted. As such, the cycle provides an explanation for endotoxin tolerance and immunosuppression, a phenomenon in which hypo-responsiveness to TLR engagement is induced by prior TLR activation (Broad et ah, (2006) Curr Med Chem 13: 2487-2502). In addition, the data disclosed herein also account for the more recently described phenomenon of cross-tolerance, in which exposure to one TLR ligand, for instance, LPS for TLR4, suppresses the subsequent response to an unrelated ligand, for instance, CpG for TLR9 (Dalpke et ah, (2005) Immunology 116: 203-212). This is because the activation of any TLR should lead to the up-regulation of TAM signaling (FIGS. 7A, 7B), which in turn will inhibit many or all TLRs.\n\n\nRemoval of the TAM pathway from the inflammation cycle is predicted to lead to a sustained hyper-response to TLR activation, and this is what was observed in the TAM receptor knock-outs. The source of activating ligands for the \n\n TAM receptors during the inflammation cycle in vivo is of interest; both Gas6 and Pro S are detectable in the DC cultures, and so, without being bound by theory, it is possible that at least a fraction of TAM signaling in these cells is autocrine/paracrine. At the same time, TAM ligands could be delivered to DCs by T cells, and in particular by suppressor or regulatory T cells [T(regs)]. DC/T cell interactions are reciprocal, and the activation status of DCs is subject to modulation by T(regs) (Bluestone & Tang (2005) Curr Opin Immunol 17: 638- 642). These suppressor T cells play pivotal roles in the maintenance of peripheral T cell tolerance, and can exert immunosuppressive activity against DCs (Bluestone & Tang (2005) Curr Opin Immunol 17: 638-642). Primary T cells express ProS, and their secretion of this TAM ligand is induced by IL-4 (Smiley et al, (1997) Pr oc Natl Acad Sci USA 94: 11484-11489). At the same time, T(regs) express IL-4 receptors, and respond to IL-4 in vitro with increased immunosuppressive activity (Maerten et al, (2005) J Autoimmun 25: 112-120).\n\n\nTAM signaling in human biology and disease\n\n\nIn mice, reduced TAM receptor levels lead to autoimmune disease (Lu & Lemke (2001) Science 293 : 306-311). Autoimmunity results from both sustained APC hyperactivation in the absence of TAM signaling (Lu & Lemke (2001) Science 293 : 306-311 ; also described herein), and also from the delayed phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells, a process in which TAM signaling also plays an important role (Scott et al. (2001) Nature 411 : 207-211; Lemke & Lu (2003) Curr Opin Immunol 15: 31-36). [The signal transduction events associated with TAM activation by apoptotic cells (Sen et al (2007) Blood 109: 653-660) are tied to those documented herein.] With regard to autoimmunity, low circulating levels of free Protein S in patients with SLE have been reported (Brouwer et al, (2004) 5/00^ 104: 143-148; Meesters et al, (2007) Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis 18: 21-28; Song et al, (2000) Arthritis Rheum 43 : 557-560). Since ProS is a TAM ligand, without being bound by theory, low ProS levels should result in reduced TAM signaling and consequently, unrestrained immune activation. In this regard, it is of interest that SLE patients are prone to thrombotic strokes (Ruiz-Irastorza et al, (2001) Lancet 357: 1027-1032), and that, in addition to its role as a TAM ligand, ProS is also a blood anti-coagulant. \n\n Elevated TAM signaling also can lead to disease. For example, hyperactive TAM signaling may play a role in acute sepsis. Circulating Gas6 levels are consistently elevated in severe sepsis patients, relative both to patients with organ failure not related to infection and to healthy subjects matched for age and gender (Borgel et al, (2006) Crit Care Med 34: 219-222). Gas6 elevation is correlated with a patient's Organ Dysfunction and Infection (ODIN) scores and with the occurrence of septic shock. Patients who succumb to sepsis are subject to the immunosuppression phenomenon discussed above, which compromises their ability to eradicate their primary infection and also predisposes them to nosocomial infections. Previous exposure to the LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, for example, leads to a decreased capacity to respond to subsequent bacterial challenges, and the innate immune systems of immunotolerant patients eventually fail in the face of infection (Cook et al, (2004) Nat Immunol 5 : 975-979). Immune tolerance and collapse are well-described phenomena in sepsis, but are incompletely understood. It is interesting to note that high levels of a TAM ligand that inhibits the innate immune response; for instance, Gas6, would facilitate just such a collapse.\n\n\nAnother setting in which hyperactive TAM can play a role is cancer. TAM receptors and ligands have been shown to be over-expressed in many malignancies (Green et al, (2006) Br J Cancer 94 1446-1451; Shieh et al, (2005) Neoplasia 7: 1058-1064; Sun et al, (2003) Ann Oncol 14: 898-906). Without being bound by theory, elevated TAM signaling could lead to tumor progression due to the intrinsic oncogenic potential of this receptor protein tyrosine kinase family (Lai et al, (1994) Oncogene 9: 2567-2578; Zong et al (1996) Embo J \\5: 4515-4525), but the results described herein indicate that elevated TAM signaling might also result in the induction of tumor tolerance via the inhibition of tumor-associated DCs. Finally, one immediate therapeutic application of the results described herein is in the area of improved adjuvants for immunization. The efficacy of many recombinant-antigen- and synthetic-peptide-based vaccines is compromised both by limited immunogenicity and the requirement for repeated immunization. Although several approaches based on positive stimulation of the immune response have been attempted (Pulendran & Ahmed, (2006) Cell 124: 849-863), it is likely that stimulation of activation pathways will in general be compensated by obligatory negative feedback mechanisms such as described herein. Small molecule inhibitors that target the TAM pathway, inhibitors of the inhibitors, can \n\n get around these compensatory pathways, and are now useful as improved adjuvants.\n\n\nConclusions The TAM signaling network represents a previously unknown, yet powerful and broadly-acting pathway for the inhibition of inflammation in DCs. The sequential induction of this pathway by, and its integration with, upstream TLR and cytokine signaling networks delimits a cycle of inflammation that governs innate immune system homeostasis. This cycle and its regulatory mechanics have important uses for therapeutic intervention in human immune system disorders.\n\n\nExample 10: Use of a TAM receptor inhibitor as an adjuvant with a\n\n\nBioThrax vaccine This Example demonstrates the use of a TAM receptor inhibitor as an adjuvant with a BioThrax vaccine. One skilled in the art will appreciate that similar methods can be used with other vaccines.\n\n\nWild-type and TAM mutant mice are immunized with BioThrax. Groups of 10 mice, both males and females at 6-8 weeks of age, across the TAM mutant series generated and maintained at the SaIk Institute, are immunized via subcutaneous injection with undiluted (0.5 ml) or 1/10 dilution of BioThrax vaccine. The mice are on a mixed C57/B16xl29sv background.\n\n\nBioThrax vaccine (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed; United States Pharmacopeia. 27 ed. Rockville, MD, USP, 2004:p. 3042-4) is prepared as a sterile culture filtrate from the avirulent Bacillus anthracis V770-NP1-R strain. The vaccine is adjuvanted with Alhydrogel®, and contains approximately 600 μg aluminum per 0.5 mL dose. Dilutions of BioThrax are prepared using Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline, without calcium or magnesium, as the diluent.\n\n\nSera are collected after immunization, and IgG concentrations of anti-PA are assayed by ELISA. Retro-orbital test bleeds are performed on mice at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks following immunization, and anti-PA (protective antigen) IgG concentrations are assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Working standards for the assay are as described by Gu et al. (2007) {Vaccine. 25(3):526-34). In the ELISA, 96-well Maxisorp™ (Nunc, Rochester, NY) plates \n\n are coated with 100 μl of rPA at 1 μg/ml in PBS at 4 \n0\nC overnight. The plates are washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) and mouse serum samples serially diluted in triplicate in PBST containing 5% instant non-fat dry milk (Giant Food) are added. Standards in the assay range from 16 ng/ml to 0.25 ng/mL of specific rPA antibody (IgG), prepared as described by Gu et al. (2007) (Vaccine. 25(3):526-34). After incubation at 4 \n0\nC overnight, the plates are washed with PBST and a 1 :5000 dilution of HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) added, and the plates then incubated for 1 hour at 37 \n0\nC. Following a wash with PBST, 2,2'-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) substrate (KPL) is added. Absorbance values are read at 405 nm. Anti- PA IgG concentrations are interpolated from a standard curve fit with a A- parameter curve using SoftMax Pro software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The limit of detection in this mouse anti-PA IgG ELISA is ~2 ng/ml. The concentrations of serum anti-PA IgG between the different TAM mutant genotypes are compared.\n\n\nNext, the neutralizing capacity of the anti-PA humoral response is assayed in vitro. The neutralizing capacity of the anti-PA humoral immune response throughout the TAM mutant series for anthrax lethal toxin is examined in vitro in a macrophage-based anthrax toxin neutralization assay (TNA). Mouse anti-PA standards used in the TNA are the same as those used in ELISAs outlined above. Cells from the J774.1 macrophage cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA) are seeded at 5 x 10\n4\n cells/well in 96-well plates in DMEM (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 10% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM 1-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. On a separate plate, mouse sera are serially diluted in medium and incubated in triplicate with 150 ng/mL of rPA and 250 ng/mL of recombinant Lethal Factor (rLF) for 1 hour at 37 \n0\nC. The mixture is then added to cells for 3.5 hours at 37 \n0\nC. Twenty-five microliters of 5 mg/mL MTT (3-(4,5- dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H tetrazolium bromide; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) is then added for 2 hours to monitor cell death, after which time lysis buffer (20% SDS in 50% N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), pH 4.7; Sigma) is added.\n\n\nPlates are read at 570 nm and neutralization activity of serum samples expressed as the NF50 (neutralization factor 50%), calculated as the effective dilution of the test serum resulting in 50% cell protection (ED50) divided by the ED50 of the reference standard. Serum samples that result in values that are below the limit of \n\n quantitation in the assay are arbitrarily assigned a value of one half the lowest possible value obtainable. For the mouse TNA, the limit of detection reported by Gu et al. (2007) (Vaccine. 25(3):526-34) was 0.06 μg/mL anti-PA IgG or 0.3 ED50 units. The following protocols validate the efficacy of small molecule, kinase- domain-based inhibitors of TAM receptor signaling as potent immunoadjuvants for an improved anthrax vaccination regimen. By inhibiting TAM-mediated inhibition of the inflammatory response to vaccination, these small molecules substantially boost the humoral immune response to BioThrax. Groups of 10 wild-type mice are immunized with either BioThrax alone\n\n\n(1 : 1 and 1 : 10), or supplemented with increasing doses of TAM small molecule inhibitors (for example, from about l μg/kg to about 50 mg/kg). The DBA strain of mice is used for these wild-type studies, since there is an extensive prior literature of response profiles to immunization with both BioThrax and recombinant PA in this mouse strain. The TAM inhibitors are related in their mode of action to orally active drugs used in cancer therapy, and are water soluble. They can therefore be added directly to the BioThrax vaccine. Groups of 10 wild-type mice are immunized with BioThrax vaccine alone or supplemented with increasing doses of AxI (TAM) inhibitor. As noted above, the currently available inhibitors from SuperGen and\n\n\nRigel, such as AXL-9 and SGL-AXL-277, operate with IC50s in the low (1-5) μM range. Newer-generation inhibitors that inhibit TAM receptor autophosphorylation will be isolated, however, that have lower IC50 values. Thus, in one embodiment, the TAM inhibitor is one that exhibits specificity for the TAM receptors relative to other tyrosine kinases, but which at the same time does not distinguish between\n\n\nAxI, Tyro 3, and Mer. (Different subsets of APCs express varying combinations of the receptors, but have always been observed to express more than one.) However, even an inhibitor that is exquisitely specific to a single TAM receptor (for instance, AxI) is useful as an adjuvant. One series of immunizations is performed at its IC50 (for instance, measured for inhibition of AxI autophosphorylation in response to 10 nM recombinant Gas6 in Axl-expressing MEFs in culture), and a second and third series at 10-fold lower and 10-fold higher concentrations than this IC50.\n\n\nAfter immunization, sera are collected and assayed for IgG concentrations of anti-PA by ELISA. Retro-orbital test bleeds are performed on mice at 2, 4, 6, \n\n and 8 weeks following immunization with BioThrax in the presence or absence of varying concentration of TAM inhibitor, and anti-PA (protective antigen) IgG concentrations are assessed by ELISA, as described above. Once an optimal inhibitor dose for the potentiation of humoral antibody response to PA is determined, a dilution analysis is performed that is similar to that reported by Gu and colleagues (2007) Vaccine. 25(3):526-34). That is, adjuvant efficacy is assessed in vaccination through dilution of the vaccine in the presence and absence of fixed optimal concentrations of the anti-TAM-based adjuvant. Sets of 10 mice are immunized subcutaneously with either undiluted BioThrax, or with vaccine diluted 1 :5, 1 : 10, or 1 :30 in the presence or absence of the TAM inhibitor. Anti- PA IgG assays are performed on sera collected at 6 weeks (day 42).\n\n\nNext, the neutralizing capacity of the anti-PA humoral response is assayed in vitro. The anthrax lethal toxin neutralizing capacity of the anti-PA humoral immune response in mice vaccinated with BioThrax, with and without varying concentrations of TAM inhibitor (for example, from about l μg/kg to about 50 mg/kg) is assessed in vitro in a macrophage-based anthrax toxin neutralization assay (TNA) as described above.\n\n\nThese results can be confirmed in guinea pigs. An immunogenicity study performed in guinea pigs is analogous to those performed with DBA mice described above. Groups of 10 animals are immunized s.c. with BioThrax (1 : 1 and 1 : 10) or BioThrax + three varying concentrations of TAM inhibitor (IC50, 0.1-fold IC50, and 10-fold IC50). The guinea pig anti-PA IgG ELISA protocol does not differ significantly from the mouse ELISA, with the exception that a guinea pig anti-rPA IgG standard is used, and an HRP-labeled goat anti-guinea pig IgG secondary antibody is used for detection. The limit of detection in the mouse and guinea pig anti-PA IgG ELISAs has been reported to be 2 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL, respectively.\n\n\nExample 11: Use of a TAM Receptor Inhibitor as an Adjuvant with a DC- based Vaccine\n\n\nThis Example describes methods of using TAM receptor inhibitors as adjuvants with DC-based vaccines, for instance with tumor vaccines. Briefly, in a dendritic cell-based vaccine protocol, dendritic cells are isolated from a subject with a tumor, and the cells are contacted with a tumor-associated antigen or\n\n\n- I l l - \n\n transfected with a vector ex vivo. The cells are then reintroduced into the subject's body, where they initiate an immune response against the tumor.\n\n\nDendritic cells (or cells from which DC can be derived, for instance, monocytes or CD34+ bone marrow progenitor cells) are obtained from a donor or from the subject (for instance, a cancer patient or a person at risk for cancer). Briefly, blood is obtained from a human subject, and the peripheral blood mononuclear cells are isolated and cultured in medium containing granulocyte- macrophage colony- stimulating factor and interleukin 4 (IL-4), or a combination of TNF, IL- lβ, IL-6, and/or PGE2, also known as monocyte-conditioned media mimic, or a cytokine cocktail such as monophosphoryl lipid A plus IFNgamma, for approximately 4-14 days as mature DCs. The mature DCs are then induced to mature after further incubation in the presence of lipopolysaccharide and/or tumor necrosis factor-α for about 24-48 hours.\n\n\nThe DCs are loaded with tumor-associated antigens by incubation with tumor cell lysates according to the method of Nestle et al. ((1998) Nat. Med.\n\n\n4:328). Briefly, day 6 BMDCs are plated in a 24-well plate containing 200 μl of medium supplemented with mGM-CSF/mIL-4 and polybrene (8 μg/ml). Concentrated tumor lysate is then added to the cells and the cells are incubated at 37 \n0\nC for 3 hours with gentle shaking every 30 minutes. The cells are then washed three times with PBS in order to collect the DCs. Antigen-exposed DCs are collected 2 days after exposure to antigen and are injected immediately into the subject as described below.\n\n\nIn some examples, a TAM receptor inhibitor (for instance, about 1 μM to about ImM) is added to the DC culture medium contemporaneously with exposure of the DC to antigen. Approximately 5 x 10\n5\n to 5 x 10\n10\n cells are then reintroduced into the subject in conjunction with an effective amount of a TAM receptor inhibitor (for instance, about 1 μM to about 1 mM). The TAM receptor inhibitor is administered subcutaneously or by intravenous infusion in a single dose substantially contemporaneously with reintroduction of the DC into the subject, which are reintroduced by intravenous infusion. Optionally, following administration of the vaccine, periodic titers are obtained as described in Example 1 in order to assess the efficacy of the vaccine. Additionally, other measures of efficacy generally are used, such as monitoring the tumor size for growth or regression. \n\n Example 12: Use of a TAM receptor inhibitors as an adjuvant during vaccination -\n\n\nThis Example demonstrates the use of a TAM receptor inhibitor as an adjuvant during vaccination.\n\n\nNormal (WT) mice as well as mice lacking Tyro3, or AxI, or Mer, or AxI and Mer, or Tyro3, AxI, and Mer, were immunized with recombinant protective antigen (rPA) from anthrax as a test immunogen. Serum antibody titers to rPA were analyzed by ELISA at two weeks after immunization. Briefly, prior to immunization, blood samples were collected from all mice by retro-orbital bleeding by use of heparinized capilars. Collected blood was dispensed into the desired labeled tube and allowed to coagulate at room temperature. Samples were then subjected to centrifugation (10 mins at 1500 rpm at room temperature). The upper phase (serum) of the sample was transferred to a new tube and store at -80C. On day 1, mice were immunized with 20 ug Anthrax Protective antigen adsorved in alum (1 : 1). Blood samples were collected every 7 days (day 14, 21, 28 and 35 post immunization) by retroorbital bleeding. Serum was prepared and stored as done for preimmune serum. On day 42, serum was collected by retroorbital bleeding and mice were given a second dose of 20ug of Anthrax Protective antigen (alone, no alum). Following the second boost, blood samples were collected again every 7 days (day 49, 56, 63 and 70 post immunization) by retroorbital bleeding. .\n\n\nAs illustrated in FIGS. 11 and 12, higher antibody titers were detected in the receptor single mutants, and highest of all in mice that lack all three TAM receptors. These results demonstrate that inhibition of TAM signaling a method for the enhancement of antibody responses to immunization.\n\n\nWhile this disclosure has been described with an emphasis upon particular embodiments, it will be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art that variations of the particular embodiments can be used and it is intended that the disclosure can be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.

La AD es una enfermedad de gran impacto en el sistema de salud pública y Ia más importante de las demencias, siendo en el mundo Ia cuarta causa de muerte después de los trastornos cardiovasculares. La prevalencia de Ia AD en el mundo es de un 12% en los mayores de 65 años. La mortalidad es de 100.000 personas por año y el costo para Ia economía norteamericana es de USD 170 millones anualmente (Wimo y Winblad, 2001).\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a difficult-to-treat disease that requires an early diagnosis to control or reduce its effects. AD is a disease of great impact on the public health system and the most important of dementias, being the fourth leading cause of death in the world after cardiovascular disorders. The prevalence of AD in the world is 12% in those over 65 years. Mortality is 100,000 people per year and the cost to the US economy is USD 170 million annually (Wimo and Winblad, 2001).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa demencia, un síndrome cognitivo caracterizado por Ia disminución en las capacidades y funciones cognitivas, afecta a un porcentaje importante de esta población. Dentro de todas las demencias, Ia AD es Ia de mayor prevalencia e incidencia. Esta realidad significa un gran gasto para el estado, y se ha determinado que ha habido un incremento en Ia incidencia de AD debido al aumento en Ia esperanza de vida. Por otra parte, existe un grupo de patologías relacionadas, las taupatías que son enfermedades en las que Ia proteína tau, un componente esencial del citoesqueleto, que se agrega en el cerebro hasta formar estructuras llamadas ovillos neurofibrilares (NFTs) (Maccioni y Cambiazo, 1995; Maccioni y col., 2001), los NFTs están formados por agregaciones poliméricas de tau, una proteína que ha sido investigada en profundidad en el contexto de Ia AD, durante más de 30 años (Maccioni y col., 1986; 1995; 2001). Estas patologías hasta hoy no tienen cura, pero el encontrar un procedimiento diagnóstico para detectarlas tempranamente, permitiría aumentar substancialmente Ia sobrevida y Ia calidad de vida de los pacientes. Además, un procedimiento y tecnologías que permitan un certero diagnóstico de Ia AD permitirán estimular el desarrollo de terapias para lograr controlar Ia enfermedad.\nDementia, a cognitive syndrome characterized by the decrease in cognitive abilities and functions, affects a significant percentage of this population. Within all dementias, AD is the one with the highest prevalence and incidence. This reality means a great expense for the state, and it has been determined that there has been an increase in the incidence of AD due to the increase in life expectancy. On the other hand, there is a group of related pathologies, the taupatías that are diseases in which the tau protein, an essential component of the cytoskeleton, that is added in the brain to form structures called neurofibrillar clews (NFTs) (Maccioni and Cambiazo, 1995 ; Maccioni et al., 2001), NFTs are formed by polymeric aggregations of tau, a protein that has been investigated in depth in the context of AD, for more than 30 years (Maccioni et al., 1986; 1995; 2001 ). These pathologies to date have no cure, but finding a diagnostic procedure to detect them early, would allow to substantially increase the survival and quality of life of patients. In addition, a procedure and technologies that allow an accurate diagnosis of AD will stimulate the development of therapies to control the disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEl acelerado desarrollo de tecnologías de neuroimagen y de Ia radio- farmacia han posibilitado importantes aportes al entendimiento de procesos fisiopatológicos que ocurren en el cerebro humano. Sin embargo, en muchas \n\n enfermedades neurodegenerativas como Ia AD\n1\n estas aproximaciones son aun muy inespecíficas, Io cual no permite realizar un diagnostico inequívoco.\nThe accelerated development of neuroimaging and radio pharmacy technologies have made important contributions to the understanding of pathophysiological processes that occur in the human brain. However, in many  Neurodegenerative diseases such as AD \n1,\n these approaches are still very nonspecific, which does not allow an unequivocal diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLas publicaciones de Klunk y col. (2004); Verhoeff y col. (2004), Glodzik y col. (2005) y Mosconi y col., (2005,2007) han entregado luces sobre algunos marcadores de placas seniles, sin embargo pese a haber sido desarrollado ya hace varios años, su aplicación clínica no ha sido establecida o implementada. El desarrollo de radio-ligandos para obtener imágenes in vivo de placas de Aβ y de ovillos neurofibrilares (NFTs), ya sea mediante PET, SPECT u otras tecnologías, es en Ia actualidad, una importante y activa área de Ia Medicina Nuclear. El diseño y evaluación biológica de agentes para obtener imágenes de placas de Aβ, ya sea por PET o SPECT requiere conocer las relaciones estructura-función de estos radioligandos y varía desde grandes proteínas y péptidos tales como Aβ y anticuerpos monoclonales radioactivos hasta pequeñas moléculas derivados del rojo Congo, Chrisamina-G, tioflavina-T, y naranja de acridina. Estudios recientes han mostrado que con este tipo de tecnologías es posible obtener imágenes in vivo en humanos sugerentes tanto de placas seniles como de los NTFs, aunque esta correlación no ha sido establecida. Hasta el momento los radiotrazadores más útiles han sido moléculas relativamente pequeñas (<600 Da). El desarrollo de radioligandos para obtener imágenes in vivo de placas de Aβ-amiloide (PAB) y de NFTs, ya sea mediante PET o SPECT, ha sido una importante y activa área de Ia industria radiofarmacéutica (Mathis y col., 2005). El marcar anormalidades patológicas específicas, serán de gran utilidad en Ia diagnóstico precoz y en Ia identificación de los sujetos en riesgo de desarrollar una enfermedad determinada.\nThe publications of Klunk et al. (2004); Verhoeff et al. (2004), Glodzik et al. (2005) and Mosconi et al., (2005,2007) have delivered lights on some senile plate markers, however despite having been developed several years ago, their clinical application has not been established or implemented. The development of radio-ligands to obtain in vivo images of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillar clews (NFTs), either by PET, SPECT or other technologies, is currently an important and active area of Nuclear Medicine. The design and biological evaluation of agents to obtain images of Aβ plaques, either by PET or SPECT, requires to know the structure-function relationships of these radioligands and varies from large proteins and peptides such as Aβ and radioactive monoclonal antibodies to small molecules derived from Congo red, Chrisamina-G, thioflavin-T, and acridine orange. Recent studies have shown that with this type of technologies it is possible to obtain in vivo images in humans suggestive of both senile plaques and NTFs, although this correlation has not been established. So far the most useful radiotracers have been relatively small molecules (<600 Da). The development of radioligands to obtain in vivo images of Aβ-amyloid plaques (PAB) and NFTs, either by PET or SPECT, has been an important and active area of the radiopharmaceutical industry (Mathis et al., 2005). The marking of specific pathological abnormalities will be very useful in early diagnosis and in the identification of subjects at risk of developing a specific disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHasta Ia fecha el único compuesto que se ha ensayado en humanos para detectar estructuras anómalas en el cerebro de pacientes con AD son el compuesto Pittsburg (PIB) y el FDDNP que marcan las placas seniles de amiloide. Sin embargo el amiloide no es un signo patognomónico para detectar el Alzheimer (Maccioni y col., 2001), y su marcación carece de valor diagnóstico patología específica. El PIB es un compuesto derivado de Ia tioflavina-T, se une a placas seniles en el cerebro, compuestas principalmente del péptido amiloide. El PIB ha sido usado sin éxito como herramienta de diagnóstico, para detectar Ia acumulación de placas seniles en el cerebro de pacientes con AD y otras demencias. Aunque el PIB es capaz de generar imágenes sugerentes de Ia disposición de las placas seniles visualizadas por medio de Ia emisión de positrones (tecnología PET) su uso en el diagnóstico de AD ha sido prácticamente nulo, debido a que las placas seniles no son \n\n patognomónicas de Ia enfermedad de Alzheimer, es decir hay individuos sanos con una carga importante de placas seniles en el cerebro y que no presentan deterioro cognitivo alguno. Por Io tanto, no se ha ensayado ningún compuesto que marque específicamente las lesiones de los NFTs formados por agregados de tau, por Io que las moléculas de Ia presente invención son los únicos productos realmente capaces de marcar específicamente estas estructuras.\nTo date, the only compound that has been tested in humans to detect abnormal structures in the brains of patients with AD are the Pittsburg compound (PIB) and the FDDNP that mark senile amyloid plaques. However, amyloid is not a pathognomonic sign to detect Alzheimer's (Maccioni et al., 2001), and its marking has no specific pathology diagnostic value. PIB is a compound derived from thioflavin-T, it binds to senile plaques in the brain, mainly composed of the amyloid peptide. The GDP has been used unsuccessfully as a diagnostic tool to detect the accumulation of senile plaques in the brains of patients with AD and other dementias. Although the GDP is capable of generating suggestive images of the disposition of the senile plates visualized by means of the emission of positrons (PET technology) their use in the diagnosis of AD has been practically null, because the senile plates are not  pathognomonic of Alzheimer's disease, that is, there are healthy individuals with an important load of senile plaques in the brain and that do not present any cognitive impairment. Therefore, no compound that specifically marks the lesions of NFTs formed by tau aggregates has been tested, so that the molecules of the present invention are the only products really capable of specifically marking these structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHasta hoy se han utilizado sin resultados positivos, diferentes tipos de técnicas de neuroimagen como una aproximación al diagnostico y evaluación de Ia evolución en el tiempo de Ia AD y taupatías (Mathis y col, 2005; Rusinek y col., 2003; Stoub y col., 2005; Rosen y col., 2005; Godbolt y col., 2006). Estas técnicas incluyen: Tomografía Axial Computarizada, resonancia magnética nuclear (NMR), tanto estructural (sNMR) como funcional NMR (fNMR), tomografía computarizada de emisión de fotones (SPECT) y también Ia tomografía de emisión de positrones (PET). Esta última proporciona información relacionada con el metabolismo cerebral de Ia glucosa. Todas estas técnicas de neuroimagen, tienen Ia ventaja de no ser técnicas invasivas por Io que se pueden aplicar en repetidas ocasiones y a distintos intervalos de tiempo, para evaluar e identificar anomalías cerebrales antes que el paciente debute con el cuadro clínico (Rusinek y col., 2003). En resumen, los procedimientos estándares de diagnóstico mediante neuroimágenes no son específicos para Ia AD, ya que virtualmente todos los esfuerzos para lograr una tecnología de neuroimágenes para AD se han dirigido a los depósitos del amiloide, incluyendo el \"Pittsburgh compound\" (PIB) y el 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2- naphthyljethylidene) malononitrile (FDDNP) (Klunk y col., 2004; Mosconi y col., 2007; Small y col., 2007); que reconocen tanto al amiloide como a los NFTs Io que no permite una visualización selectiva. De acuerdo a estos estudios no queda claro que lesiones se pretende visualizar (por ejemplo placas 'difusas' vs. 'completas', etc.). Se sabe que el primer compuesto no visualiza los NFTs, y el último puede visualizar diferentes tipos de lesiones, además de los NFTs, por Io que no sirve como herramienta diagnóstica (Mathis et al., 2005; Furomoto, 2007). Por otro lado, las solicitudes de patentes PCT/US96/05918; PCT/US98/07889; PCT/J P01/02204 y PCT/J P01/02205 describen compuestos incapaces de identificar selectivamente NTF's.\nUntil today, different types of neuroimaging techniques have been used without positive results as an approximation to the diagnosis and evaluation of the evolution over time of AD and taupatías (Mathis et al., 2005; Rusinek et al., 2003; Stoub et al. ., 2005; Rosen et al., 2005; Godbolt et al., 2006). These techniques include: Computed Axial Tomography, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMR), both structural (sNMR) and functional NMR (fNMR), photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and also positron emission tomography (PET). The latter provides information related to the cerebral metabolism of glucose. All these neuroimaging techniques have the advantage of not being invasive techniques, which can be applied repeatedly and at different time intervals, to evaluate and identify brain abnormalities before the patient debuts with the clinical picture (Rusinek et al., 2003). In summary, standard neuroimaging diagnostic procedures are not specific to AD, since virtually all efforts to achieve neuroimaging technology for AD have been directed to amyloid deposits, including the \"Pittsburgh compound\" (GDP) and 2- (1- {6 - [(2- [F-18] fluoroethyl) (methyl) amino] -2-naphthyljethylidene) malononitrile (FDDNP) (Klunk et al., 2004; Mosconi et al., 2007; Small et al., 2007); that recognize both amyloid and NFTs that do not allow selective visualization. According to these studies, it is not clear which injuries are intended to be visualized (for example 'diffuse' vs. 'complete' plates, etc.). It is known that the first compound does not visualize the NFTs, and the last one can visualize different types of lesions, in addition to the NFTs, so it does not serve as a diagnostic tool (Mathis et al., 2005; Furomoto, 2007). On the other hand, patent applications PCT / US96 / 05918; PCT / US98 / 07889; PCT / J P01 / 02204 and PCT / J P01 / 02205 describe compounds unable to selectively identify NTF's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEl desarrollo de radio-marcadores patología-específicos para las enfermedades neurodegenerativas es esencial no sólo para el diagnóstico sino también para monitorear nuevas terapias de Ia AD. Cabe hacer notar que el \n\n diagnóstico confirmatorio de AD solamente se puede hacer mediante neuropatología, tras el análisis \"postmortem\" de tejido cerebral. Sin embargo existe Ia posibilidad de obtener imágenes de los ovillos neurofibrilares (NFTs), principal signo histológico- molecular de Ia AD y de las taupatías, y se dispondría así de una poderosa herramientas para un diagnóstico neuro-patológico de certeza en vida y un método para evaluar Ia evolución del proceso fisiopatológico de Ia AD (Lavados y cois., 2005; Fernández y cois., 2008; Kuljis, 2008). Existen algunas aproximaciones a esta necesidad pero no se ha desarrollado hasta ahora una herramienta de diagnostico del todo satisfactoria y especifica, manteniéndose aun sin resolver el problema del diagnóstico temprano de Ia AD (US2006018825; WO02069965; Okamura, 2004 y 2005). Por ejemplo, Okamura ha descrito un conjunto de compuestos derivados de benzimidazoles con el objeto de detectar agregados del péptido amiloide Aβ, sin profundizar en los estudios sobre el uso de estos benzimidazoles como radiotrazadores en el diagnóstico PET mediante detección de los ovillos neurofibrilares. No obstante ninguno de los compuestos analizados por el grupo de Okamura han sido usados en Ia práctica clínica ni han tenido éxito para su uso en imagenología PET, y sus estudios preclínicos podrían tardar mucho en validar su posible uso, por Io que están lejos de poder ser considerados como potenciales radiotrazadores para el reconocimiento de los NFTs mediante Tomografía de Emisión de Positrones (PET). En este contexto, nuestro invento está dirigido a compuestos que se unen a agregados de tau con alta especificidad y que servirían como radiotrazadores patología-específicos con el objeto de diagnosticar tempranamente Ia enfermedad de Alzheimer.\nThe development of pathology-specific radio-markers for neurodegenerative diseases is essential not only for diagnosis but also for monitoring new therapies of AD. It should be noted that the  Confirmatory diagnosis of AD can only be made by neuropathology, after \"postmortem\" analysis of brain tissue. However, there is the possibility of obtaining images of the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), the main histological-molecular sign of AD and taupatias, and thus a powerful tool for a neuro-pathological diagnosis of certainty in life and a method would be available. to evaluate the evolution of the pathophysiological process of AD (Lavados y cois., 2005; Fernández y cois., 2008; Kuljis, 2008). There are some approaches to this need but a completely satisfactory and specific diagnostic tool has not been developed so far, while still remaining unsolved the problem of early diagnosis of AD (US2006018825; WO02069965; Okamura, 2004 and 2005). For example, Okamura has described a set of benzimidazole-derived compounds in order to detect aggregates of the amyloid Aβ peptide, without deepening the studies on the use of these benzimidazoles as radiotracers in PET diagnosis by detecting neurofibrillar clews. However, none of the compounds analyzed by the Okamura group have been used in clinical practice or have been successful for use in PET imaging, and their preclinical studies could take a long time to validate their possible use, so they are far from being able to be considered as potential radiotracers for the recognition of NFTs by Positron Emission Tomography (PET). In this context, our invention is directed to compounds that bind tau aggregates with high specificity and that would serve as pathology-specific radiotracers in order to diagnose Alzheimer's disease early.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa posibilidad de obtener imágenes de los ovillos neurofibrilares de Ia AD, o de cualquier otra proteína patognomónica daría a Ia medicina Ia oportunidad, sin precedentes, de un diagnóstico de certeza que hoy día sólo se puede lograr mediante estudios neuropatológicos post-mortem. Además, entregaría Ia posibilidad de un diagnóstico precoz, un método para Ia evolución del proceso patológico y un modelo par evaluar intervenciones terapéuticas específicas. Por Io tanto, se requiere de un diagnóstico de neuroimágenes, específico para una determinada lesión. Por esta razón, los compuestos benzimidazolicos (BZs) son capaces de unirse a Ia tau agregada en Ia forma patológica presente en Ia AD, son los radiotrazadores más promisorios para desarrollar Ia tecnología de neuroimágenes PET. Más interesante aún, Ia invención entrega benzimidazoles conocidos y clínicamente probados que se unen a tau \n\n agregada. Los grandes beneficios de Ia presente invención son: 1) Diagnóstico patológico específico. 2) Diagnóstico temprano y posibilidad de un diagnóstico presintomático de Ia AD. 3) Comprender Ia evolución natural de Ia enfermedad y su fisiopatología. 4) Capacidad de medir directamente los efectos de terapias específicas que se desarrollen en el futuro. Lo anterior se debe a que Ia presente invención permite el obtener imágenes con moléculas de \n18\nF-benzimidazoles, demostrándose así su afinidad diferencial con tau de los ovillos neurofibrilares (NFT) y no con Ia tau normal o monomérica, ni tampoco con agregados del péptido Aβ, Io que hace que nuestra tecnología sea altamente específica y confiable para el certero diagnóstico de Ia AD. Los benzimidazoles de Ia presente invención tienen Ia ventaja de que son drogas utilizadas en medicina para otros propósitos y no producen efectos secundarios serios en los pacientes. DESCRIPCIÓN DE LAS FIGURAS\nThe possibility of obtaining images of the neurofibrillar clews of the AD, or of any other pathognomonic protein would give the medicine the opportunity, unprecedented, of a diagnosis of certainty that today can only be achieved by post-mortem neuropathological studies. In addition, it would provide the possibility of an early diagnosis, a method for the evolution of the pathological process and a model to evaluate specific therapeutic interventions. Therefore, a diagnosis of neuroimaging is required, specific to a specific lesion. For this reason, the benzimidazolic compounds (BZs) are capable of binding to the tau added in the pathological form present in the AD, they are the most promising radiotracers for developing the PET neuroimaging technology. Even more interesting, the invention delivers known and clinically proven benzimidazoles that bind tau  added. The great benefits of the present invention are: 1) Specific pathological diagnosis. 2) Early diagnosis and possibility of a presymptomatic diagnosis of AD. 3) Understand the natural evolution of the disease and its pathophysiology. 4) Ability to directly measure the effects of specific therapies that are developed in the future. The foregoing is due to the fact that the present invention allows obtaining images with \n18\n F-benzimidazoles molecules, thus demonstrating their differential affinity with tau of the neurofibrillar clews (NFT) and not with the normal or monomeric tau, nor with peptide aggregates Aβ, which makes our technology highly specific and reliable for the accurate diagnosis of AD. The benzimidazoles of the present invention have the advantage that they are drugs used in medicine for other purposes and do not produce serious side effects in patients. DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFigura 1. Electromicrografía de los filamentos de tau humana agregada in Vitro y PHFs aislados desde pacientes con AD. A y B muestran filamentos de tau humana (441 a. a.) inducidos por heparina 200 μM. (20.000X). C y D muestran PHFs aislados desde pacientes con AD: Barra 80 nm. Las flechas indican las torsiones de los filamentos helicoidales. En los filamentos inducidos por heparina predomina Ia presencia de filamentos rectos por sobre los helicoidales, donde se verificó que los filamentos inducidos por heparina son más largos que los obtenidos desde cerebros humanos y con menor número de torsiones, es decir, Ia mayoría de los filamentos inducidos in Vitro son rectos y no helicoidales. La heterogeneidad estructural de los filamentos de tau ha sido descrita ya por varios autores. (Skravana y col., 2006; Csokova y col., 2003). Considerando estas diferencias estructurales en los filamentos de tau formados in Vitro e in vivo, se estudiaron separadamente los parámetros de interacción de diferentes con filamentos inducidos por heparina y aislados desde pacientes con AD. Adicionalmente, se conoce que los sitios expuestos en ambas conformaciones -filamentos de tau humana agregada in Vitro y PHFs aislados desde pacientes con AD- donde se unen moléculas como las descritas en Ia presente invención, son los mismos. No obstante, aun no es posible de elucidar con claridad el mecanismo por el cual PHFs se conforma, Io cual llevaría a una mejor comprensión de las similitudes entre ambas estructuras.\nFigure 1. Electromicrograph of human tau filaments added in Vitro and PHFs isolated from patients with AD. A and B show human tau filaments (441 a.) Induced by 200 µM heparin. (20,000X). C and D show PHFs isolated from patients with AD: 80 nm bar. The arrows indicate the twists of the helical filaments. In the heparin-induced filaments, the presence of straight filaments predominates over the helical ones, where it was verified that the heparin-induced filaments are longer than those obtained from human brains and with less number of twists, that is, the majority of the filaments In Vitro induced are straight and non-helical. The structural heterogeneity of tau filaments has already been described by several authors. (Skravana et al., 2006; Csokova et al., 2003). Considering these structural differences in tau filaments formed in Vitro and in vivo, the interaction parameters of different with heparin-induced filaments and isolated from AD patients were studied separately. Additionally, it is known that the sites exposed in both conformations -filaments of human tau added in Vitro and PHFs isolated from patients with AD- where molecules such as those described in the present invention are attached, are the same. However, it is not yet possible to clearly elucidate the mechanism by which PHFs conform, which would lead to a better understanding of the similarities between the two structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFigura 2. Gráficas de Scatchard. Las gráficas de Scatchard muestran los estudios de saturación realizados para evaluar Ia afinidad de 3H-Astemizol por agregados de Aβ (A), filamentos de tau humana recombinante (B) y PHFs de \n\n pacientes con AD (C). Se aprecia en estos casos que las moléculas de Ia presente invención se unen con mayor afinidad a tau que a péptido Aβ, en donde es significativamente mayor Ia afinidad a PHFs comparada con Aβ.\nFigure 2.

The Scatchard graphs show the saturation studies performed to assess the affinity of 3H-Astemizole for aggregates of Aβ (A), recombinant human tau filaments (B) and PHFs of  AD patients (C). It is appreciated in these cases that the molecules of the present invention bind with greater affinity to tau than to Aβ peptide, where the affinity to PHFs is significantly greater compared to Aβ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFigura 3 muestra un gráfico sobre estudios de inhibición realizados con lansoprazol sobre filamentos de Tau aislados de pacientes con enfermedad de\nFigure 3 shows a graph on inhibition studies conducted with lansoprazole on Tau filaments isolated from patients with disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAlzheimer para N=3±SD, mediante el desplazamiento de astemizol marcado.

La tabla muestra que astemizol llega eficientemente al tejido cerebral, registrando a los 28 minutos (Tmax) una concentración máxima en sangre, mientras que a los 55 minutos Io obtiene en cerebro. Además se aprecia que Ia vida media en plasma es menor que en cerebro, entregando una permanencia en encéfalo de al menos 3 horas. Lo anterior hace de esta molécula un excelente agente para emplear como radiotrazador cerebral.

Estas son moléculas pequeñas que tienen Ia propiedad de unirse específicamente y con gran afinidad a los ovillos neurofibrilares, y e consecuencia entregan Ia posibilidad de detectar estas estructuras mediante estudios de neuroimágenes, como es el caso de PET. Esta propiedad de los BZs permite el \n\n desarrollo de estrategias de neuroimágenes específicas para visualizar las lesiones más características de Ia enfermedad de Alzheimer, esencial no sólo para mejorar el diagnóstico de patologías, sino también para desarrollar nuevos tratamientos mediante ensayos que permitan Ia identificación de nuevos principios activos para enfermedades neurodegenerativas.\nwhich can be found radioactively marked with elements that emit gamma rays such as \"mTc, \n111\n In, \n67\n Ga, \n201\n TI, \n123\n I and \n133\n Xe; and / or marked with elements that emit positrons such as \n11\n C, \n13\n N, \n15\n O and \n18\n F, and / or with \n3\n H; preferably the compounds are labeled with \n3\n H and \n18\n F and / or fluorescent emitting elements, preferably and without the intention of restricting the scope of the invention , said known fluorophores can be selected from FAM, DYXL, Hex, Tet, Joe, Rox, Tamra, Yac, Max, Edans, Cy5, LC670, Fluorescein, Coumarin, Eosin, rhodamine, Bodipy, Alexa, Blue waterfall, Yakima yellow, Lucifer yellow and texas red These are small molecules that have the property of binding specifically and with great affinity to the neurofibrillar clews, and consequently deliver the possibility of detecting these structures by neuroimaging studies, such as PET. the BZs allows the  development of specific neuroimaging strategies to visualize the most characteristic lesions of Alzheimer's disease, essential not only to improve the diagnosis of pathologies, but also to develop new treatments through tests that allow the identification of new active principles for neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nConforme a Ia presente invención, se ha encontrado que derivados de benzimidazol de fórmula I\n1\n de preferencia astemizol y/o lansoprazol radioactivos, son compuestos capaces de unirse a formas agregadas de Ia proteína tau con muy alta afinidad, Io cual es de gran importancia farmacológica ya que reviste a Ia invención con un enorme potencial como radiotrazadores para neuroimágenes, en el diagnóstico de Ia enfermedad de Alzheimer (AD).\nAccording to the present invention, it has been found that benzimidazole derivatives of formula I \n1\n , preferably radioactive astemizole and / or lansoprazole, are compounds capable of binding to aggregate forms of the tau protein with very high affinity, which is of great pharmacological importance. since it has the invention with enormous potential as radiotracers for neuroimaging, in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEn efecto, como se aprecia en Ia figura 2, Ia interacción de proteína ligando es inmensamente ventajosa para astemizol, ya que se aprecia una mayor afinidad de este agente cuando se liga a sistemas proteicos de Tau comparado con amiloide. Algo equivalente se aprecia para lansoprazol, en Ia figura 3 se muestra que a bajas concentraciones lansoprazol desplaza a astemizol en filamentos de proteína Tau de enfermos de Alzheimer. Lo anterior, queda de manifiesto en Ia tabla 1 donde se muestran valores de Bmax/Kd para Ia interacción de astemizol con Aβ y Tau. A través de este valor se aprecia que astemizol registra una afinidad diferencial para dichos blancos, ya que por PHF es alta (3,316) en relación a Ia afinidad que muestra por fibras de Aβ (0,057). En efecto, Ia afinidad de astemizol por PHF es alrededor de 60 veces mayor que para Aβ, significativamente mayor a Io descrito para compuestos equivalentes divulgados con anterioridad. Si se consideran los antecedentes del estado del arte, por ejemplo US2006/0018825 describe algunos benzoxazoles, benzotiazoles y benciimidazoles -estructuralmente diferentes a los empleados en Ia presente invención- sin identificar cuantitativamente Ia afinidad del agente por Aβ o tau. Por otro lado, Okamura y col., 2005, describe un benciimidazol -estructuralmente diferentes a los empleados en Ia presente invención- identificado como BP 126, el cual se muestra sólo dos veces más afín por fibras de tau que por Aβ (valores de EC\n50\n en Tabla 1 de Ia referencia: EC\n50\n por Tau= 583 nM; EC\n50\n por Aβ= 1280 nM).\nIn fact, as can be seen in Figure 2, the interaction of ligand protein is immensely advantageous for astemizole, since a greater affinity of this agent is observed when bound to Tau protein systems compared to amyloid. Something equivalent is seen for lansoprazole, in Figure 3 it is shown that at low concentrations lansoprazole displaces astemizole in Tau protein filaments of Alzheimer's patients. The above is shown in Table 1 where values of Bmax / Kd are shown for the interaction of astemizole with Aβ and Tau. Through this value it can be seen that astemizole registers a differential affinity for said targets, since PHF is high (3,316) in relation to the affinity it shows for Aβ fibers (0,057). In fact, the affinity of astemizole for PHF is about 60 times greater than for Aβ, significantly greater than that described for equivalent compounds previously disclosed. If the background of the state of the art is considered, for example, US2006 / 0018825 describes some benzoxazoles, benzothiazoles and benzimidazoles - structurally different from those used in the present invention - without quantitatively identifying the affinity of the agent for Aβ or tau. On the other hand, Okamura et al., 2005, describes a benzimidazole - structurally different from those used in the present invention - identified as BP 126, which is shown only twice as similar by tau fibers than by Aβ (EC values \n50\n in Table 1 of the reference: EC \n50\n for Tau = 583 nM; EC \n50\n for Aβ = 1280 nM).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLas constantes de afinidad de los compuestos de Ia presente invención se encuentran en el rango de nM (nanomolar) Io que indica su gran afinidad por esta variante patológica de Ia proteína tau. Esto posibilita su uso como marcador específico de agregados cerebrales de tau y, por Io tanto, es un excelente trazador para estudio por neuroimagen, por ejemplo por Tomografía de Emisión de Positrones (PET), y para \n\n estudios de neuroimágen del daño cerebral que caracteriza a enfermedades como el\nThe affinity constants of the compounds of the present invention are in the range of nM (nanomolar) which indicates their great affinity for this pathological variant of the tau protein. This enables its use as a specific marker of tau brain aggregates and, therefore, is an excellent tracer for neuroimage study, for example by Positron Emission Tomography (PET), and for  neuroimaging studies of brain damage that characterizes diseases such as\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAlzheimer y otras taupatías, en las cuales Ia proteína tau forma agregados en el cerebro, y otros órganos y tejidos.\nAlzheimer's and other taupatías, in which the tau protein forms aggregates in the brain, and other organs and tissues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPor otra parte, Ia presente invención entrega evidencias respecto de Ia farmacocinética de las drogas, indicando que las moléculas de astemizol y/o lansoprazol acceden al cerebro de manera eficiente y permanecen por al menos 3 horas, Io que posibilita Ia generación de imágenes cerebrales por estudio por neuroimágen, por ejemplo por Tomografía de Emisión de Positrones (PET).\nOn the other hand, the present invention provides evidence regarding the pharmacokinetics of drugs, indicating that astemizole and / or lansoprazole molecules access the brain efficiently and remain for at least 3 hours, which allows the generation of brain images by neuroimaging study, for example by Positron Emission Tomography (PET).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEn efecto, conforme a Ia presente invención, los agentes propuestos tienen una mejor residencia en cerebro y encéfalo que en sangre. Como se muestra en las figuras 4 a 6, astemizol y lansoprazol muestran una increíble eficiencia para llegar y mantenerse en el tejido cerebral, mientras que Ia presencia en sangre disminuye más rápida y notoriamente. Estas cualidades hacen de los compuestos propuestos en Ia presente invención un excelente candidato con enorme potencial como radiotrazadores para neuroimágenes de enfermedades neurodegenerativas, tau dependientes, para Io cual es de gran importancia farmacológica ya que Ia invención entrega moléculas que son excelentes candidatos para el diagnóstico de Ia enfermedad de Alzheimer (AD).\nIn fact, according to the present invention, the proposed agents have a better residence in brain and brain than in blood. As shown in Figures 4 to 6, astemizole and lansoprazole show an incredible efficiency in reaching and maintaining brain tissue, while the presence in blood decreases more rapidly and notoriously. These qualities make the compounds proposed in the present invention an excellent candidate with enormous potential as radiotracers for neuroimaging of neurodegenerative diseases, tau dependent, for which it is of great pharmacological importance since the invention delivers molecules that are excellent candidates for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLo anterior se debe a que Ia presente invención facilita Ia posibilidad de marcar una lesión específica y patognomónica de Ia AD, con Io cual se permitiría diagnosticar AD y taupatías, con diagnóstico diferencial debido a que:\nThe foregoing is due to the fact that the present invention facilitates the possibility of marking a specific and pathognomonic lesion of AD, which would allow the diagnosis of AD and taupatias, with differential diagnosis because:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n- Las moléculas de bencimidazoles de Ia invención se unen selectivamente a agregados de proteína tau mucho más que a los agregados del péptido Aβ (Figura 2 y Tablas 1 y 2). - Estas moléculas permiten detectar Ia presencia de formas agregadas de Ia proteína tau, Io que no es posible con PIB ni con otros compuestos que se usen actualmente en medicina nuclear humana.\n- The benzimidazole molecules of the invention selectively bind tau protein aggregates much more than the Aβ peptide aggregates (Figure 2 and Tables 1 and 2). - These molecules allow detecting the presence of aggregate forms of the tau protein, which is not possible with GDP or with other compounds that are currently used in human nuclear medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n- Estas moléculas presentan ventajas con respecto a otras moléculas que se usan para producir imágenes del cerebro como Ia glucosa, debido a su alta afinidad por agregados de Ia proteína tau. El compuesto radio-trazador más usado para imagenología por emisión de positrones es Ia Fluordeoxiglucosa, sin embargo, su unión al tejido cerebral es muy inespecífica porque se concentra mayormente en todas las células con alta tasa metabólica y no en los agregados macromoleculares de Ia proteína tau como Io hace astemizol y lansoprazol. Además en Ia AD hay una caída en Ia captación de F-deoxyglucosa en las neuronas corticales. \n\n - Las evidencias in vivo en ratones indican que Ia concentración de las moléculas de Ia presente invención marcadas con \n18\nF en el cerebro es alta y se mantiene en el cerebro por a Io menos 3 horas Io que permite su utilización como radiotrazador cerebral (Figuras 4 y 5). - Adicionalmente, astemizol y lansoprazol son compuestos médica y clínicamente probados y autorizados, con abundante evidencia clínica en aplicaciones diferentes a las aquí propuestas. Además, a partir de dichas evidencias no se podría haber derivado Io que en esta invención se propone y demuestra con las experiencias in vivo e in Vitro ejecutadas y aquí incorporadas como parte de Ia invención. En efecto, Astemizol es una droga antihistamínica y el Lanzoprazol se usa en clínica como inhibidor de Ia bomba de protones, por Io que drogas aceptadas para su uso médico y nuestro invento se relaciona con una nueva aplicación nunca antes descrita para dichos compuestos.\n- These molecules have advantages over other molecules that are used to produce images of the brain such as glucose, due to their high affinity for aggregates of the tau protein. The most used radio-tracer compound for positron emission imaging is Fluordeoxyglucose, however, its binding to brain tissue is very non-specific because it is mostly concentrated in all cells with high metabolic rate and not in macromolecular aggregates of the tau protein as does astemizole and lansoprazole. Furthermore, in AD there is a fall in the uptake of F-deoxyglucose in cortical neurons.  - The evidences in vivo in mice indicate that the concentration of the molecules of the present invention marked with \n18\n F in the brain is high and is maintained in the brain for at least 3 hours which allows its use as a brain radiotracer (Figures 4 and 5). - Additionally, astemizole and lansoprazole are medical and clinically proven and authorized compounds, with abundant clinical evidence in applications other than those proposed here. In addition, from these evidences it could not have been derived from what is proposed and demonstrated in this invention with the in vivo and in vitro experiences executed and incorporated herein as part of the invention. In fact, Astemizole is an antihistamine drug and Lanzoprazole is used clinically as a proton pump inhibitor, because of what drugs accepted for medical use and our invention relates to a new application never described before for said compounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nConforme a Ia presente invención las técnicas donde se pueden emplear las moléculas descritas pueden ser: Tomografía Axial Computarizada (CAT)\n1\n resonancia magnética nuclear (NMR), tanto estructural (sNMR) como funcional NMR (fNMR), tomografía computarizada de emisión de fotón único (SPECT) y Ia tomografía de emisión de positrones (PET).\nIn accordance with the present invention the techniques where the described molecules can be used can be: Computed Axial Tomography (CAT) \n1\n nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), both structural (sNMR) and functional NMR (fNMR), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDe esta forma Ia invención proporciona una herramienta farmacológicamente segura, médicamente probada, con una elevada afinidad y selectividad por estructuras proteicas de proteína Tau, en desmedro de Aβ, Io cual permite establecer una aplicación, método o uso de dichos agentes para Ia identificación y diagnóstico de enfermedades neurodegenerativas, tau patologías, de preferencia enfermedad de Alzheimer. Lo que permite no solamente el diagnóstico de Ia enfermedad manifestada, sino que una determinación precoz de Ia misma considerando el hecho que Tau esta directamente relacionada con el desarrollo y deterioro de dichas patologías, especialmente AD. Estas evidencias permitirían hacer un diagnóstico de enfermedades neurodegenerativas en etapas iniciales asintomáticas de Ia patología, favoreciendo de esta forma que se puedan aplicar a dichos pacientes tratamientos preventivos y curativos de manera anticipada, favoreciendo y elevando así las expectativas de mejora y control sobre Ia enfermedad, impartiendo una mejora sustancias en Ia calidad de vida de los paciente, Io cual es impensado hasta ahora con métodos actuales de diagnóstico postmorten o cuando Ia enfermada ya esta declarada, clínicamente confirmada y en estados avanzados. \n\n Ejemplo 1. Evaluación de Ia afinidad específica de benzimidazoles por agregados de proteína tau.\nIn this way, the invention provides a pharmacologically safe, medically proven tool, with a high affinity and selectivity for protein structures of Tau protein, at the expense of Aβ, which allows establishing an application, method or use of said agents for the identification and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, tau pathologies, preferably Alzheimer's disease. This allows not only the diagnosis of the manifested disease, but also an early determination of the same considering the fact that Tau is directly related to the development and deterioration of these pathologies, especially AD. These evidences would make it possible to make a diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases in asymptomatic initial stages of the pathology, thus favoring that preventive and curative treatments can be applied to said patients in advance, thus favoring and raising the expectations of improvement and control over the disease, imparting an improvement substances in the quality of life of the patient, which is so far unthinkable with current methods of postmortem diagnosis or when the patient is already declared, clinically confirmed and in advanced stages.  Example 1. Evaluation of the specific affinity of benzimidazoles for aggregates of tau protein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCon el fin de evaluar Ia afinidad específica de los benzimidazoles por agregados de proteína tau, se determinaron parámetros de afinidad (constantes de disociación (Kd) y de máxima unión (Bmax)) de \n3\nH-Astemizol por agregados de tau, además se evaluó las constantes de inhibición (Ki) por agregados de Ia proteína tau en ensayos de desplazamiento de H\n3\n-Astemizol. La determinación de las constantes Kd y\nIn order to evaluate the specific affinity of benzimidazoles for aggregates of tau protein, affinity parameters (dissociation constants (Kd) and maximum binding (Bmax)) of \n3\n H-Astemizole per tau aggregates were determined, in addition it was evaluated the inhibition constants (Ki) by aggregates of the tau protein in displacement assays of H \n3\n -Astemizole. The determination of the constants Kd and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBmax es un paso previo y necesario para determinar las constantes Ki. Es decir, se necesita tener un valor de Kd obtenido de un radioligando conocido para llegar a obtener los valores de Ki por ensayos de inhibición y utilizando Ia ecuación de Cheng\nBmax is a previous and necessary step to determine the Ki constants. That is, it is necessary to have a Kd value obtained from a known radioligand to get to obtain the Ki values by inhibition tests and using the Cheng equation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPrusoff.\nPrusoff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDichos experimentos se realizaron utilizando proteína tau extraída de pacientes con AD y agregados del péptido Aβ^\n2\n sintéticos obtenidos a partir de soluciones del monómero obtenido de pacientes con AD. 1.1. Obtención de los agregados de proteína tau y péptido Aβ.\nThese experiments were performed using tau protein extracted from patients with AD and synthetic Aβ ^ \n2\n peptide aggregates obtained from solutions of the monomer obtained from patients with AD. 1.1. Obtaining the aggregates of tau protein and Aβ peptide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa obtención de las diferentes proteínas fue realizada de Ia siguiente manera: a) Filamentos helicoidales de tau (PHF) fueron aislados de acuerdo a Io descrito por Vinzent y Davies (1992). Brevemente, se construyeron columnas de inmuno-afinidad en base a Proteína-A acoplada al anticuerpo específico MC-1 específico para filamentos helicoidales pareados de tau. La eficiencia de acoplamiento de el anticuerpo en Ia fase estacionaria de Ia columna fue >90%. El soporte inmuno- adsorbente fue depositado en columnas y lavado con TBS (3 veces). Luego Ia columna fue mantenida a 4\n0\nC. EL sobrenadante (27.000 x g) de homogeneizados de cerebro se cargo en esta columna a un flujo de 25mL/hora. La unión inespecífica se minimizó mediante lavados sucesivos con 30 veces el volumen de Ia columna de tampón TBS. Las fracciones enriquecidas en PHFs fueron dializadas y almacenadas a -7O\n0\nC hasta su utilización. b) Agregados del péptido amiloide: los agregados de péptido sintético Aβ se obtuvieron mediante incubación del péptido en tampón PBS1X por 7 días. Los agregados se monitorearon mediante microscopía electrónica de transmisión y geles de poliacrilamida.\nThe different proteins were obtained in the following manner: a) Tau helical filaments (PHF) were isolated according to what described by Vinzent and Davies (1992). Briefly, immuno-affinity columns were constructed based on Protein-A coupled to the specific MC-1 specific antibody for helical tau filament filaments. The coupling efficiency of the antibody in the stationary phase of the column was> 90%. The immuno-adsorbent support was deposited on columns and washed with TBS (3 times). Then the column was maintained at 4 \n0\n C. The supernatant (27,000 xg) of brain homogenates was charged in this column at a flow of 25mL / hour. The non-specific binding was minimized by successive washes with 30 times the volume of the TBS buffer column. The fractions enriched in PHFs were dialyzed and stored at -7O \n0\n C until use. b) Amyloid peptide aggregates: Aβ synthetic peptide aggregates were obtained by incubation of the peptide in PBS1X buffer for 7 days. The aggregates were monitored by transmission electron microscopy and polyacrylamide gels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1.2. Determinación de parámetros de interacción de \n3\nH-Astemizol por agregados de proteína tau y péptido Ap\n1\n^\n2\n \n\n Para evaluar Ia afinidad de \n3\nH-Astemizol por los agregados de ambas proteínas, se estudiaron los siguientes parámetros de interacción proteína-ligando: constantes de disociación (Kd) y de máxima unión (Bmax). La Kd, constante de disociación, es un parámetro inversamente proporcional a Ia afinidad de los compuestos. Bmax es Ia unión máxima, e indica Ia máxima cantidad de Ia droga que se une a una determinada cantidad de agregado de tau o péptido Aβ. Dichos experimentos fueron realizados siguiendo el siguiente protocolo METODOLOGÍA DE LOS ESTUDIOS DE AFINIDAD: Para verificar Ia afinidad de astemizol (AST) y lansoprazol (LNS) por agregados de tau, se realizaron ensayos de saturación con AST-tritiado. Brevemente se incubaron polímeros de tau (40 Dg mL de PHF alzheimer y 0,01 mg/mL de filamentos in Vitro) en presencia de concentraciones crecientes de AST-tritiado (0-2,5-5,0-7,5-10,5-12,5 nM). Luego Ia mezcla fue filtrada en frío (4\n0\nC) en filtros Watman GF/B. Filtro fue secado a temperatura ambiente y posteriormente se midió Ia radiactividad retenida en los filtro en contador de Centelleo TRICARB-2100 TR en presencia de 2 mL de liquido de centelleo.\n1.2. Determination of interaction parameters of \n3\n H-Astemizole by aggregates of tau protein and Ap \n1\n ^ \n2\n peptide  To evaluate the affinity of \n3\n H-Astemizole for the aggregates of both proteins, the following parameters of protein-ligand interaction were studied: dissociation constants (Kd) and maximum binding (Bmax). The Kd, dissociation constant, is a parameter inversely proportional to the affinity of the compounds. Bmax is the maximum binding, and indicates the maximum amount of the drug that binds to a certain amount of tau aggregate or Aβ peptide. These experiments were performed following the following protocol METHODOLOGY OF AFFINITY STUDIES: To verify the affinity of astemizole (AST) and lansoprazole (LNS) by tau aggregates, saturation tests were performed with AST-tritiated. Briefly, tau polymers (40 Dg mL of PHF Alzheimer's and 0.01 mg / mL of filaments in Vitro) were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of AST-tritiated (0-2.5-5.0-7.5-10 , 5-12.5 nM). Then the mixture was filtered cold (4 \n0\n C) in Watman GF / B filters. Filter was dried at room temperature and subsequently the radioactivity retained in the filters in TRICARB-2100 TR Scintillation counter was measured in the presence of 2 mL of scintillation liquid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEstudios de Inhibición: Se estudió Ia interacción de Lanzoprazol con filamentos de tau (PHFs y filamentos inducidos por heparina) mediante el desplazamiento de Astemizol tritiado. Esto se realizó mediante Ia incubación de 40 ug/mL de PHF alzheimer y 0,01 mg/mL de filamentos in Vitro con una serie de diluciones crecientes de LNS (0,09 hasta 0,000003 mM). Luego Ia mezcla fue filtrada en frío (4\n0\nC) en filtros Watman GF/B. El filtro GF/B fue secado a temperatura ambiente y posteriormente se midió Ia radiactividad retenida en el filtro usando un contador de Centelleo TRICARB- 2100 TR en presencia de 2 mL de líquido de centelleo.\nInhibition Studies: The interaction of Lanzoprazole with tau filaments (PHFs and heparin-induced filaments) was studied through the displacement of tritiated Astemizole. This was done by incubating 40 ug / mL of PHF Alzheimer's and 0.01 mg / mL of filaments in Vitro with a series of increasing dilutions of LNS (0.09 to 0.000003 mM). Then the mixture was filtered cold (4 \n0\n C) in Watman GF / B filters. The GF / B filter was dried at room temperature and subsequently the radioactivity retained in the filter was measured using a TRICARB-2100 TR Scintillation counter in the presence of 2 mL of scintillation liquid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEn Ia Figura 2 se muestran las imágenes obtenidas mediante microscopía electrónica del experimento realizado y las gráficas de Scatchard que dan cuenta del análisis de Ia información. En Ia Tabla 1 se muestra un análisis comparativo de los datos de saturación. Estos resultados indican que el \n3\nH-Astemizol se une con mayor afinidad a los agregados de proteína tau que a los agregados de péptido Aβ\n1-42\n, dado que Ia relación Kd/Bmax para Ia unión a agregados de proteína tau humana (PHFs) fue cerca de 60 veces superior que para los agregados del péptido Ap\n1-42\n Ello apoya el uso de los compuestos de Ia invención como radiotrazadores patología específica, a diferencia del \"PIB compound\" que se unen al Aβ más que a los PHFs de tau. Si bien en Ia presente invención los valores de Bmax/Kd no son significativamente elevados, como se esperaría en condiciones óptimas con relación Bmax/Kd cercana a 10, los compuestos descritos aquí tienen un elevado potencial como radiotrazador \n\n cerebral. Lo anterior se ve reforzado ante Ia evidencia que en el caso de las patologías exploradas en Ia presente invención, se encuentran blancos moleculares muy abundantes en el parénquima cerebral, como son los NFTs en los pacientes con AD (Mathis y cois, 2004, Okamura y cois, 2005, Klunk y cois., 2005), por Io cual los valores de afinidad expuestos son suficientes para una aplicación diagnostica y preventiva exitosa.\nFigure 2 shows the images obtained by electron microscopy of the experiment performed and the Scatchard graphs that account for the analysis of the information. Table 1 shows a comparative analysis of the saturation data. These results indicate that \n3\n H-Astemizole binds with greater affinity to tau protein aggregates than to Aβ \n1-42\n peptide aggregates, given that the Kd / Bmax ratio for binding to human tau protein aggregates (PHFs) It was about 60 times higher than for Ap \n1-42\n peptide aggregates. This supports the use of the compounds of the invention as specific pathology radiotracers, unlike the \"PIB compound\" that bind Aβ rather than tau PHFs. . Although in the present invention the values of Bmax / Kd are not significantly high, as would be expected under optimal conditions with a Bmax / Kd ratio close to 10, the compounds described herein have a high potential as a radiotracer  cerebral. The foregoing is reinforced by the evidence that in the case of the pathologies explored in the present invention, very abundant molecular targets are found in the cerebral parenchyma, such as NFTs in patients with AD (Mathis et al., 2004, Okamura and cois, 2005, Klunk and cois., 2005), whereby the affinity values shown are sufficient for a successful diagnostic and preventive application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTabla 1.

Estos ensayos fueron realizados según el protocolo descrito más arriba.\nThe affinity of Lansoprazole was evaluated by aggregates of human tau protein by means of \n3\n H-Astemizole displacement assays. These tests were performed according to the protocol described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEn Ia Tabla 2 se muestran los resultados de los estudios de inhibición y Ia constante Ki obtenida para cada molécula, obtenida a través de Ia ecuación de Cheng-Prusoff (Okamura y col., 2004, 2005).\nTable 2 shows the results of the inhibition studies and the Ki constant obtained for each molecule, obtained through the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Okamura et al., 2004, 2005).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTabla 2.

Lansoprazol se une con mayor afinidad (Ki 2,7 nM) que BF 168 (Ki 6,4 nM) a agregados de Ia proteína tau. Sin perjuicio de Io anterior, cualquier valor en el rango de nM es potencialmente útil como potencial radio-marcador de un agregado macromolecular o receptor que esta presente en el parénquima cerebral.\nIt can be seen that lansoprazole has a Ki significantly higher than that recorded for other compounds in the art ... Lansoprazole binds with greater affinity (2.7 nM Ki) than 168 BF (6.4 nM Ki) to protein aggregates tau Notwithstanding the foregoing, any value in the nM range is potentially useful as a potential radio-marker of a macromolecular aggregate or receptor that is present in the brain parenchyma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPara complementar las evidencias anteriores se realizaron estudios de Docking con el programa Autodock®, dirigidos a ensayos bio-informáticos para astemizol. Estos confirman que Ia presente invención registra favorables valores respecto de Ia energía de unión de este ligando a tau, respaldando Ia alta afinidad que se aprecia en las otras evidencias que se reportan en Ia invención aquí descrita. La tabla 3 muestra valores predictivos para 10 configuraciones preferenciales de interacción PHF-Tau con astemizol modelados por el programa Autodock®, entregando además comparación con las energías de unión de ligandos para algunos fármacos con alta afinidad por los receptores de glutamato mGlu4 y mGlu7 obtenidas con el mismo programa (Yanamala y col., 2008). Aquí se resumen los datos obtenidos del análisis bio-informático de Docking para astemizol y el fragmento resistente a pronasa PHF-Tau-387DHGAE391 del cual se conoce perfectamente su estructura cristalina y debido a que se encuentra expuesto en los en los filamentos pareados de Ia proteína Tau como describe Novak y col., 1989. Debido a las cualidades estructurales de Tau no se ha logrado una cristalización de Ia proteína total. Los datos indican que astemizol registra una alta afinidad por el fragmento 387DHGAE391 de Tau, mientras que metronidazol presenta valores menos favorables. Menores valores de energías de unión con más favorables.\nTo complement the previous evidence, Docking studies were carried out with the Autodock® program, aimed at bio-computer tests for astemizole. These confirm that the present invention registers favorable values regarding the binding energy of this ligand to tau, supporting the high affinity that can be seen in the other evidences reported in the invention described herein. Table 3 shows predictive values for 10 preferential configurations of PHF-Tau interaction with astemizole modeled by the Autodock® program, also providing comparison with ligand binding energies for some drugs with high affinity for mGlu4 and mGlu7 glutamate receptors obtained with the same program (Yanamala et al., 2008). Here we summarize the data obtained from the bio-computer analysis of Docking for astemizole and the pronase resistant fragment PHF-Tau-387DHGAE391 of which its crystalline structure is perfectly known and because it is exposed in the paired filaments of the protein Tau as described by Novak et al., 1989. Due to the structural qualities of Tau, a total protein crystallization has not been achieved. The data indicate that astemizole registers a high affinity for the 387DHGAE391 fragment of Tau, while metronidazole has less favorable values. Lower union energy values with more favorable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTabla 4 \n\n Sitio de interacción entre Astemizol y PHF-tau: Análisis bioinformático {AutoDock Energies)\nTable 4  Interaction site between Astemizol and PHF-tau: Bioinformatic analysis {AutoDock Energies)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEjemplo 2.

From these solutions dilutions were made for a concentration range of 0.02 and 0.4 mg / mL. An aliquot was then taken between 0.5 µl to .1000 µl of each of the stock solutions prepared above in different 25 mL volumetric flasks, and was filled to volume with pH 7.4 buffer. Then 25 mL of octanol is measured, added in three separatory funnels, and each settling funnel was added to the solutions prepared above, both phases are mixed, stirring vigorously for two minutes. The complete separation of the phases is allowed, leaving them to stand for 48 hours. Once equilibrium is reached, both phases are separated. The aqueous phase is centrifuged for 3 min. To ensure the complete separation of the phases. This whole process is carried out at a temperature of 25 \n0\n C. The quantification is carried out in a UVA / spectrophotometer. Table 4 shows the values obtained for the Pe and LogP coefficients for the benzimidazoles analyzed according to the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTabla 4: Coeficiente de permeabilidad específica (Pe) y coeficiente de partición (LogP) obtenido para los benzimidazoles en estudio.\nTable 4: Specific permeability coefficient (Pe) and partition coefficient (LogP) obtained for the benzimidazoles under study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLogP SNC significa coeficiente de Partición en relación a su potencial liposoluble que permite atravesar Ia BHE. Los resultados obtenidos indican que Astemizol y Lansoprazol son los compuestos con mejor perfil de liposolubilidad para ser considerados como potenciales trazadores de acción cerebral, ya que atraviesan \n\n eficientemente membranas fosfolipídicas. Esto no cambia las propiedades fisicoquímicas de Ia molécula.\nLogP SNC means partition coefficient in relation to its liposoluble potential that allows to cross the BHE. The results obtained indicate that Astemizole and Lansoprazole are the compounds with the best liposolubility profile to be considered as potential tracers of brain action, since they cross  efficiently phospholipid membranes. This does not change the physicochemical properties of the molecule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEjemplo 3. Evaluación de Ia farmacocinética de Astemizol y Lansoprazol in vivo en modelos animales.\nExample 3. Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of Astemizole and Lansoprazole in vivo in animal models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLos compuestos Lansoprazol y Astemizol fueron analizados por cromatografía líquida de alta resolución (HPLC) asociadas a detección por UV en las condiciones cromatográficas adaptadas del método descrito por Kanazawa y col., 2002. En las Figuras 4 y 5 se muestran los resultados de experimentos farmacocinéticos de los compuestos Lansoprazol y Astemizol. En estos resultados se evidencia que Astemizol (Fig. 4) llega eficientemente al tejido cerebral (C), el tiempo para Ia máxima concentración (tmax) es 28 min. en sangre y es 55 min en cerebro, Io que es compatible con su potencial como radiotrazador PET debido a que el período de semi-desintegración del Fluor 18 es de 120 min. También se observa que Ia vida media de Astemizol en el plasma es inferior a Ia del cerebro. Esto da cuenta de una permanencia en el encéfalo de por Io menos tres horas, siendo compatible con su uso como radio trazador cerebral (Ono y col., 2006, Mathis y col., 2004, 2005).\nThe compounds Lansoprazole and Astemizole were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) associated with UV detection under the chromatographic conditions adapted from the method described by Kanazawa et al., 2002. The results of pharmacokinetic experiments are shown in Figures 4 and 5. of the compounds Lansoprazole and Astemizole. These results show that Astemizole (Fig. 4) efficiently reaches the brain tissue (C), the time for maximum concentration (tmax) is 28 min. in blood and is 55 min in brain, which is compatible with its potential as a PET radiotracer because the half-disintegration period of Fluor 18 is 120 min. It is also observed that the half-life of Astemizole in plasma is shorter than that of the brain. This accounts for a stay in the brain for at least three hours, being compatible with its use as a brain tracer radio (Ono et al., 2006, Mathis et al., 2004, 2005).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEn Ia Figura 5 se muestra que Lansoprazol llega eficientemente al tejido cerebral (C), el tiempo para Ia máxima concentración (tmax) es 30 min en Ia sangre y 37 min en el cerebro, Io que es compatible con su potencial uso como radiotrazador PET debido a que el período de semidesintegración del Fluor 18 es de 120 min. Por otro lado, se observa que Ia vida media del Lansoprazol en el plasma es inferior a Ia del cerebro, posiblemente debido a Ia gran capacidad metabólica del hígado y las enzimas circulantes en el plasma a diferencia de Io que ocurre en el tejido cerebral que es un compartimiento farmacocinético altamente lipídico que elimina las drogas más lentamente.\nFigure 5 shows that Lansoprazole efficiently reaches the brain tissue (C), the time for maximum concentration (tmax) is 30 min in the blood and 37 min in the brain, which is compatible with its potential use as a PET radiotracer because the half-life of Fluor 18 is 120 min. On the other hand, it is observed that the half-life of Lansoprazole in the plasma is inferior to that of the brain, possibly due to the great metabolic capacity of the liver and the circulating enzymes in the plasma unlike what occurs in the brain tissue that is a highly lipid pharmacokinetic compartment that eliminates drugs more slowly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLos antecedentes expuestos claramente favorecen y evidencian que los compuestos expuestos conforme a Ia invención son útiles en aplicaciones diagnósticas preventivas -en etapas tempranas de alguna patología neurodegenerativa- o diagnóstico confirmatorio en etapas avanzadas, sin requerir una confirmación post- morten tal como ocurre en Ia actualidad. Considerando Ia abúndate evidencia clínica de estas moléculas para otras patologías, el uso propuesto en este caso resulta sorprendente y altamente ventajoso respecto de las evidencias mostrada para moléculas estructuralmente equivalentes en el estado del arte. \n\n Adicionalmente se realizaron experimentos de bio-distribución del compuesto Lansoprazol marcado radiactivamente (\n18\nF-Lansoprazol). En Ia figura 6 se muestran los resultados del ensayo de bio-distribución cerebro/sangre, en Ia figura se puede apreciar que el \n18\nF-Lansoprazol llega al cerebro en un 0,3% a los 30 minutos y disminuye a 0,14% a los 60 minutos. Las relaciones de bio-distribución cerebro/sangre en ambos tiempos fueron de 0,23 y 1,27 respectivamente, Io que da cuenta de una permanencia mayor del fármaco en el cerebro que en Ia sangre. Estos resultados son concordantes con Io que se observa al analizar Ia farmacocinética del Lansoprazol sin mareaje radiactivo. Ejemplo 4. Evaluación de Ia fijación de los benzimidazoles a los Ovillos Neurofibrilares (ONFs) en secciones finas de cerebros humanos de enfermos de Alzheimer.\nThe exposed background clearly favors and evidences that the compounds exposed according to the invention are useful in preventive diagnostic applications -in early stages of some neurodegenerative pathology- or confirmatory diagnosis in advanced stages, without requiring post-mortar confirmation as is currently the case. . Considering the clinical evidence of these molecules for other diseases, the use proposed in this case is surprising and highly advantageous with respect to the evidence shown for structurally equivalent molecules in the state of the art.  Additionally, bio-distribution experiments of the radiolabelled Lansoprazole compound ( \n18\n F-Lansoprazole) were performed. Figure 6 shows the results of the brain / blood bio-distribution test, in the figure it can be seen that \n18\n F-Lansoprazole reaches the brain in 0.3% at 30 minutes and decreases to 0.14% at 60 minutes The brain / blood bio-distribution ratios at both times were 0.23 and 1.27 respectively, which accounts for a greater permanence of the drug in the brain than in the blood. These results are concordant with what is observed when analyzing the pharmacokinetics of Lansoprazole without radioactive tide. Example 4. Evaluation of the fixation of benzimidazoles to the Neurofibrillary Clews (ONFs) in thin sections of human brains of Alzheimer's patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa presente invención muestra en estudios preliminares que Astemizol y Lanzoprazol se unen a estructuras de ONFs en cerebros postmortem de pacientes con AD, mediante estudios autoradiográficos y de fluorescencia. Conforme a Io anterior, y con el objeto de evaluar el uso de Ia presente invención en pacientes, se verificó Ia presencia de ONFs y placas seniles en secciones de corteza cerebral de pacientes con diagnóstico clínico de Enfermedad de Alzheimer. Dicha evaluación se realizó mediante inmunohistoquímica con anticuerpos específicos para placas seniles, anticuerpo 6E10 reactivo contra residuos 6-13 de péptido Aβ, y con anticuerpo PHF1 específico contra tau. Los resultados se muestran en las figuras 8 y 9.\nThe present invention shows in preliminary studies that Astemizol and Lanzoprazole bind to ONF structures in postmortem brains of patients with AD, by autoradiographic and fluorescence studies. In accordance with the above, and in order to evaluate the use of the present invention in patients, the presence of ONFs and senile plaques in sections of cerebral cortex of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease was verified. This evaluation was carried out by immunohistochemistry with antibodies specific for senile plaques, antibody 6E10 reactive against residues 6-13 of Aβ peptide, and with specific PHF1 antibody against tau. The results are shown in figures 8 and 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEl objetivo que se busca con estos ensayos es mostrar las pruebas de co-localización de dichos anticuerpos con Ia aplicación de moléculas marcadas con radioactividad o fluorescencia de Ia presente invención. Así graficar Ia aplicación diagnóstica que registra Ia invención aquí propuesta.\nThe objective sought with these tests is to show the evidence of co-localization of said antibodies with the application of molecules labeled with radioactivity or fluorescence of the present invention. Thus graph the diagnostic application that registers the invention proposed here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEn resumen, cerebros postmorten de pacientes con diagnóstico clínicamente probado de Alzheimer son fijados en formalina 10%, se efectúan cortes con sección entre 5 a 200 μm, de preferencia de 20 μm. Estos cortes son incubados con los benzimidazoles marcados conforme a Ia presente invención y posteriormente son incubados con los anticuerpos específicos 6E10 y PHF1 , para determinar Ia co- localización de Ia marca en estructuras de proteína Tau de las secciones de cerebro evaluadas.\nIn summary, postmortem brains of patients with clinically proven diagnosis of Alzheimer's are fixed in 10% formalin, cuts are made with a section between 5 to 200 μm, preferably 20 μm. These sections are incubated with the benzimidazoles labeled according to the present invention and subsequently incubated with the specific antibodies 6E10 and PHF1, to determine the co-location of the label in Tau protein structures of the brain sections evaluated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nComo se muestra en Ia Figura 10, en pacientes tratados conforme al proceso anteriormente descrito, se aprecia que benzimidazoles marcan de forma eficiente y selectiva los sectores positivos para tau en vez de los sectores positivos \n\n para Aβ, de acuerdo a Io que muestran los estudios con los anticuerpos anteriormente mencionados. Con ello queda plenamente identificado que Ia presente invención respalda aplicaciones de dichos benzimidazoles como agentes diagnósticos de enfermedades neurodegenerativos y taupatologías como Ia enfermedad de Alzheimer. En Ia ejecución de las pruebas anteriormente mencionadas se han utilizado dos tecnologías diferentes de co-localización de astemizol o lanzoprazol marcados para identificar las estructuras patológicas de los ovillos neurofibrilares en cerebros postmortem de pacientes Alzheimer: 1) Marcación con benzimidazoles tritiados, siguiendo el protocolo descrito en detalle en Ia Figura 11. 2) Marcación fluorescente con benzimidazoles. Para efectos prácticos como parte de los ejemplos, se analiza Ia co-localización de Ia tau marcada con anticuerpos conjugados a un fluoroforo, con Ia localización de Ia droga marcada fluorescentemente. En estos ensayos se verifica Ia co-localización de las drogas con las estructuras agregadas de Tau en regiones del hipocampo, corteza entorrina y núcleos de Meynert de los cerebros postmortem con Ia enfermedad de Alzheimer analizados. Por otra parte, en los controles de cortes de cerebros sanos de sujetos de Ia misma edad que los cerebros Alzheimer analizados, Ia droga marcada no se fije a ningún tipo de estructuras ni a otras estructuras no relacionadas (agregados de amiloide o placas por ejemplo), puesto que éstos no evidencias lesiones del tipo de los ovillos neurofibrilares formados por Ia tau patológica. Con esta evidencia demostramos Ia especificidad de los benzimidazoles de Ia presente invención para su utilización como segundo uso en el desarrollo de un método diagnóstico con tecnología PET para Ia determinación temprana y asintomática de Ia enfermedad de Alzheimer.\nAs shown in Figure 10, in patients treated according to the process described above, it is seen that benzimidazoles efficiently and selectively mark the positive sectors for tau instead of the positive sectors  for Aβ, according to what the studies with the aforementioned antibodies show. With this, it is fully identified that the present invention supports applications of said benzimidazoles as diagnostic agents for neurodegenerative diseases and taupathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. In the execution of the aforementioned tests, two different technologies of co-localization of astemizole or lanzoprazole have been used to identify the pathological structures of the neurofibrillary tangles in postmortem brains of Alzheimer's patients: 1) Marking with tritiated benzimidazoles, following the protocol described in detail in Figure 11. 2) Fluorescent marking with benzimidazoles. For practical purposes as part of the examples, the co-location of the tau labeled with antibodies conjugated to a fluorophore is analyzed, with the location of the fluorescently labeled drug. In these trials, the co-location of drugs with the aggregate structures of Tau in regions of the hippocampus, entorrine cortex and Meynert nuclei of postmortem brains with Alzheimer's disease analyzed is verified. On the other hand, in the controls of cuts of healthy brains of subjects of the same age as the Alzheimer brains analyzed, the labeled drug is not fixed to any type of structures or other unrelated structures (amyloid aggregates or plaques for example) , since these do not show lesions of the type of neurofibrillar clews formed by the pathological tau. With this evidence we demonstrate the specificity of the benzimidazoles of the present invention for use as a second use in the development of a diagnostic method with PET technology for the early and asymptomatic determination of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nReferencias relevantes:\nRelevant References:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdveef y Tsinman, 2006 PAMPA-a drug absorption in vitro model 13.

Description\n\n\n\n\n MSP-1 protein preparations from Plasmodium\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\nThe invention relates to a merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) from Plasmodium, a method of preparing a modified nucleic acid encoding the p83/30 protein subunit thereof, corresponding modified nucleic acids, vectors comprising the same, the corresponding p83/30 subunit of MSP-1 , a method of preparing heterodimeric MSP-1 , corresponding heterodimeric MSP-1 proteins for use as vaccines, uses of these heterodimeric MSP-1 proteins for making medicaments for preventing and/or treating malaria and a vaccine comprising any of the above nucleic acid, vector or protein products.\n\n\nBackground of the invention\n\n\nMalaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. According to estimates from the World Health Organisation (WHO) 400 to 900 million incidences of the disease are registered annually. According to information from the Multilateral Initiative against Malaria (MIM) between 700,000 and 2.7 million people die each year from the infection (MIM, 2001). In this respect 40% of the world's population in 99 countries are put at risk from malaria. The disease is caused by single-cell protozoa of the genus Plasmodium from the phylum Apicomplexa. There are four species which infect humans: Plasmodium malariae, responsible for Malaria quartana, Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale, both of which cause Malaria tertiana, and finally Plasmodium falciparum, the pathogen of Malaria tropica and responsible for almost all fatal infections.\n\n\nMalaria is again currently spreading to an increasing extent. This is primarily attributable to intensive resistance formation of the malaria pathogen which is promoted in that the medicaments used for the therapy are also recommended and used for prophylaxis. Apart from the search for new chemotherapeutics, research is concentrating on the development of vaccines, because in the course of malaria infections in humans, immunity mechanisms are applied, a fact which is expressed in an increased resistance to the Plasmodia, as demonstrated in the development of various types of immunity in humans in regions where malaria epidemics prevail.\n\n\nMSP-1 as a potential vaccine \n\n MSP- 1 is the main surface protein of merozoites, the invasive form of the blood phases of the malaria pathogen. It is synthesized as a 190-220 kDa precursor which is fixed at the parasite surface via a glycosylphosphatidyl anchor. This protein is processed later during the development of the merozoites into smaller protein fragments which, however, remain non- covalently associated at the merozoite surface up to the invasion of erythrocytes by the parasites.\n\n\nThe sequences of the MSP-1 proteins of various P. falciparum strains fall into two groups, which have been named after two representative (prototypic) isolates K, and MAD20. Overall the protein consists of a number of highly preserved regions, dimorphic regions which allow the assignment of a given version of MSP-1 to one of the representative prototypes, and two relatively small oligomorphic blocks in the N-terminal part of the protein (Fig. 9 herein; Tanabe et al. (1987) J. MoI. Biol. 195, 273-87).\n\n\nThe immunization of mice with the protein purified from P. yoelii parasites protected the animals from the otherwise fatal infection. Also, the transfer of monoclonal antibodies against MSP-1 from P. yoelii provided protection in the mouse model.\n\n\nApart from studies on mice, Saimiri and Aotus monkeys have also been immunised with native, immune-affinity purified MSP-1. In these tests the protein obtained from P. falciparum partially provided either partial or complete protection against the ensuing infection by the parasite.\n\n\nPurification of native material from Plasmodia is however expensive and this material cannot be used for production on a large scale. Therefore research into vaccines is concentrated on the development of recombinant vaccines.\n\n\nFor example, mice have been successfully immunized with MSP-1 -19 purified from E. coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Daly and Long (1993) Infect. Immun. 61 , 2462-7; Ling et al. (1994) Parasite Immun. 16, 63-7; Tian et al. (1996) J. Immunol. 157, 1176-83; Hirunpetcharat et al (1997) J. Immunol. 15, 3400-11), as well as Mycobacterium bovis carrying MSP-1 -19 (Matsumoto et al. (1999) Vaccine 18, 832-4). Alternatively to immunization with native or recombinant proteins, DNA coding for MSP-1 -19 has also been \n\n used as a vaccine and protected immunized mice against infection with P. chabaυdi (Wunderlich et al. (2000) Infect. Immun. 68, 5839-45).\n\n\nIn Phase I and Il studies with MSP-1 fragments as vaccines, their immunogeneity was also shown in humans. In this respect p19 from P. falciparum fused onto a T-helper cell epitope of tetanus toxin (Keitel et al. (1999) Vaccine 18, 531-9) and the MSP-1 blocks 3 and 4 (Saul et al. (1999) Vaccine 17, 3145-59; Genton et al. (2000) Vaccine 18, 2504-11) are involved.\n\n\nSome epidemiological studies in endemic regions show with adults a correlation between antibody titers against MSP-1 and the immunity against malaria (ToIIe et al. (1993) Infect. Immun. 61, 40-7; Riley et al. (1992) Parasite Immunol. 14, 321-37; Riley et al. (1993) Parasite Immunol. 15, 513-24). These investigations together with the immunization studies on animals prove that MSP-1 is a promising candidate for the development of a malaria vaccine.\n\n\nGenerally, these studies can be differentiated into two approaches. Either purified material from parasites or material obtained in heterologous systems may be used.\n\n\nBoth for functional investigations and also for use as a vaccine, proteins must be produced reproducibly in a good yield and high quality. MSP-1 can be purified from parasites, but this is only possible on a small scale and with great expense and therefore cannot be carried out for obtaining MSP-1 according to the stated criteria in this way.\n\n\nHeterologous production of full-length (190 kD) MSP-1 protein is extremely inefficient. Although this full-length protein contains the four major processing fragments p83, p30, p38 and p42 which, after proteolytic processing, form the non-covalently associated heterotetramer, the extremely large size makes efficient heterologous production difficult, severely limiting obtainable yield. Specifically, the high AT-content of 76-78% of the respective parasite genes prevents stable cloning and heterologous expression in good yield. This problem has been solved by synthetic genes encoding the proteins in different codon compositions. Further, recovering a 190 kD protein containing numerous disulfide bonds in its proper conformation, for example from E. coli, is difficult experimentally, and wholly unsuited to technical scale preparation required for use of this protein as a vaccine. \n\n Since MSP-1 is not glycosolated in the parasite despite numerous potential glycosolation sites, a prokaryotic expression system would be of advantage for technical scale preparation. However, the folding problems due to multiple disulfide bonds mentioned above persist. Kauth et al. (2003) (Journal of Biological Chemistry 278, 2257-2264) describes the construction of a heteromultimeric MSP-1 complex composed of recombinantly produced MSP-1 protein subunits. Here, synthetic polynucleotides encoding subunits and processing fragments of the MSP-1 complex of P. falciparum from strain 3D7 are used to generate each of the four individual MSP-1 subunits individually in highly purified and soluble form from E. coli. These subunits are then reassembled to form the MSP-1 heterotetramer. Kauth et al. (2003) describe production of the MSP-1 protein subunits p83, p30, p38 and p42 as well as two synthetic subunit \"halves\" p83/30 and p38/42. The subunit half p83/30 contains the amino sequences of the p83 and p30 subunits, linked into a single contiguous polypeptide. Likewise, the subunit half p38/42 contains the amino sequences of the p38 and p42 subunits, linked into a single contiguous polypeptide. While Kauth et al. indicates that stable production of MSP-1 protein for the purposes described above may best proceed via production of a heteromultimer, especially a heterodimer of the p83/30 and p38/42 subunits, the heteromultimeric proteins obtained in Kauth et al. (2003) remain ill-suited for the intended application as a vaccine.\n\n\nFirst, the MSP-1 subunits of Kauth et al. were labeled with either HiS\n6\n- or GST-tags so that they could be efficiently purified. These tags were required to isolate a sufficient amount of the subunit in high purity. Such tags are problematic from a regulatory standpoint, and post- expression proteolytic removal of the tags causes great loss in product. Thus, omitting protein tag would comply with regulatory requirements, but would result in a protein which is difficult if not impossible to purify. On the other hand, retaining the protein tag allows purification but precludes any use of the resulting protein as an approved therapeutic/vaccine.\n\n\nA further problem encountered when constructing a heterodimer of p83/30 and p38/42 in a manner strictly analogous to Kauth et al. is that production of the p83/30 subunit in E. colils very inefficient. Even using an isolation tag, only very low levels of p83/30 are recovered. Moreover, the small amount of the p83/30 fragment produced to begin with is attenuated further still by potent degradation in vivo. \n\n There is thus a need for MSP-1 which is efficiently producible, complies with regulatory requirements set for therapeutic proteins, remains isolable in the high yield required for technical preparation and allows the generation of a strong immune response against P. falciparum. This need is met by the present invention.\n\n\nBrief description of the invention\n\n\nOne aspect of the invention provides a merozoite surface protein 1 (\"MSP-1\") preparation of Plasmodium, said MSP-1 preparation comprising\n\n\n(a) a purified fragment p83/30 of the gp190/MSP-1 from Plasmodium without heterologous sequences, and\n\n\n(b) a purified fragment p38/42 of the gp190/MSP-1 from Plasmodium without heterologous sequences.\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention provides a composition comprising the above MSP-1 preparation.\n\n\nThe composition of the present invention may be manufactured by a method of preparing a Plasmodium MSP-1 containing composition, said method comprising:\n\n\na) Expressing the fragment p83/30 of the gp190/MSP-1 protein from Plasmodium without heterologous sequences in a host cell;\n\n\nb) Expressing the fragment p38/42 of the gp190/MSP-1 protein from Plasmodium without heterologous sequences in a host cell;\n\n\nc) Recovering the fragment p83/30 and the fragment p38/42 from the host cells;

The comparison illustrates the marked modification of predicted secondary mRNA structure achieved by destabilizing mRNA secondary structure known or suspected of harboring ribosomal binding sites. The effect of the destabilization was analyzed by in silico substitution of single nucleotides. The first 150 bp of the p83/30 mRNA were subjected to in silico analysis of secondary structure by using the \"mfold\" program by Zuker and Turner (version 3.2) provided by the web server of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA (for references see hereinbelow). Nucleotides of ribosomal binding site (\"RBS \") and base-pairing sequences are as indicated. The translation start site (AUG) is also indicated.\n\n\nFig. 2: Comparison of the amount of crude protein expression product obtained using unmodified mRNA encoding MSP-1 fragment p83/30 (left, from Plasmodium falciparum strain 3D7) and mRNA in which regions of secondary hairpin-like structure containing ribosomal binding sites and/or translation initiation sites have been mutated to destabilize the hairpin-like structure (right) in E. coli. MSP-1 protein subunit p83/30 is represented by the dark band in the 2 hour and 4 hour lanes of the gels for both the native and mutated sequences at approximately 1 16 kD, as measured by the marker ladder at far right. As can \n\n be seen by comparing the respective 2 hour and 4 hour lanes in the left and right panels, modification of the MSP-1 p83/30 fragment led to a higher amount of expressed protein (right) than the corresponding unmodified sequence (left).\n\n\nFig. 3: Time course of the production of MSP-1 halves p83/30 (left, based on mutated nucleic acid sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 8 or 9) and p38/42 (right, based on a nucleic acid sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 10). Lanes 1 and 11 (counted from left) show molecular weight marker ladders. Lanes 2-5 and 12-15 (counted from left) show a dilution series for p83/30 and p38/42 fragments of MSP-1 , respectively, based on the highest amount of protein obtained after 4 hours of expression. Lanes 6-10 and 16-20 show a time course over 0, 1 , 2, 3 and 4 hours of expression for the respective MSP-1 halves p83/30 and p38/42. In each case, the accumulation of protein expression product corresponding approximately to 116 kD corresponds to the desired respective MSP-1 half. 2-fold dilutions up to 1/8 of the original concentration were prepared from the 4h sample. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining.\n\n\nFig. 4: A typical fermentation process in a 15 liter fermenter (Braun, Biostat) shown by example of W3110Z2-p38/42. A typical fermentation process in a 15 liter fermenter is shown. The growth of the culture with time is shown. Induction of expression of the p38/42 fragment of MSP-1 took place at the timepoint indicated by the letter \"i\" in the figure.\n\n\nFig. 5 Electrophoretic analysis of solubilized IBs. The positions of the two MSP-1 fragments p83/30 and p38/42 are indicated at the side of the gel. SDS-PAGE was performed with 10% polyacrylamide under reducing conditions, followed by Coomassie staining.\n\n\nFig. 6 Summary of the characterization of proteins present in MSP-1 preparations.\n\n\nThe 15 most abundant protein bands are numbered, and were identified by at least one of the following methods (indicated in the title row of the table to the right of the figure): Western Blot with rabbit sera specific for p83/30 (\"anti- p83/30), Western Blot with rabbit sera specific for p38/42 (\"anti-p38/42), pool \n\n of monoclonal antibodies specific for p83 or p42 (\"mab pool p83+p42\"), direct identification by N-terminal sequencing (\"N-term. sequence\") and peptide mapping using mass spectrometry (\"peptide mapping\"). The numbers for the gel bands correspond to the numbers in the leftmost column in the table, with an \"x\" in the table indicating that a certain analysis method was applied to the protein in the correspondingly numbered band. As can be seen, all detectable components could be identified either by N-terminal sequencing, by peptide mapping via mass spectroscopy or by appropriate monoclonal/polyclonal antibodies against the p83/30 and/or p38/42 fragments of MSP-1.\n\n\nFig. 7: Antibody titers in mouse sera obtained after immunization with MSP-1 in different formulations. Higher bars indicate higher antibody titres, indicating a stronger (and therefore more desirable) immune response to a respective protein. Titers were determined by ELISA using MSP-1 heterodimeric protein made of p83/30 and p38/42 as capture antigen. A: PBS; B: aluminum hydroxide; E: aluminum phosphate; H: MPL (Sigma); I, CpG (Qiagen); L - Q:\n\n\nIC31 ; R: PBS; S: Montanide ISA720; T: Montanide ISA51 : U - W: Virosomes; X, Y: FCA/FIA. IS.1 - IS.3: Sera from first, second or third immunisation.\n\n\nFig. 8: Rabbit antibody titers following immunization with heterodimeric MSP-1 produced as indicated herein (indicated as \"MSP-1 D\" at the upper right of the figure), p83, p30, p38 and p42 together with various adjuvants. Higher bars indicate higher antibody titers, indicating a stronger (and therefore more desirable) immune response to a respective protein. The bars represent results from ELISA studies. Equal amounts of a respective protein as antigen were administered to rabbits (100 μg per injection). The adjuvants used together with the various proteins are indicated below a respective cluster of result bars along the x-axis. The adjuvant \"X1\" denotes an adjuvant obtained under a secrecy agreement. As can be seen in the third cluster of result bars, administration of MSP-1 heteromultimer, as well as selected fragments thereof together with montanide, ISA720 led to significantly higher antibody titres in rabbit than observed when same proteins were administered with other adjuvants. This is especially the case for the MSP-1 heterodimer as prepared herein as well as for the individual MSP-1 protein subunits p83, p30 and p38. \n\n Fig. 9: Schematic depiction of the primary structure of the MSP-1 derived from P. falciparum strain 3D7 as \"MSP-1 D\", a representative of the MAD20 prototype and various fragments thereof which have been recombinantly produced. The numbers below the scheme denote amino acid positions. \"SP\" denotes \"signal peptide. \"GA\" denotes a glycosynphosphatidylinositol moiety. The arrows at the top of Fig. 9A indicate the sites where the precursor protein is normally cleaved into its major subunits p83 to p42, which are shown in Fig. 9B. A secondary proteolysis cleaves p42 into p33 and p19. The amino acid positions delineate heterologously produced fragments p83, p30, p38 and p42. The isolation tag designations \"g\", \"h\" and \"s\" refer to GST, HiS\n6\n and Strep tags, respectively. MSP-1 fragments p83/30 and p38/42, are shown in rows 2 and 4, respectively, of Fig. 9B. In this figure, these fragments bear heterologous isolation tags which can be advantageously omitted under the present invention.\n\n\nFig. 10: SEQ ID NO: 1.

At the same time, the protein is compliant with the Good Manufacturing Practice (\"GMP\") requirement that therapeutic proteins intended for administration may not contain isolation tags, for example HiS\n6\n, as such tags interact with/chelate substances in the body of the patient. It should be emphasized that without isolation tags, the MSP-1 would normally have proven difficult to recover at all, let alone in the amounts required for preparation of a vaccine based on this protein. As described hereinbelow, the present inventors have determined how to isolate and recover sufficient amounts of MSP-1 protein as a heterodimer preparation for technical scale preparation of medicaments while complying with regulatory requirements set for therapeutic protein intended for administration to patients. As such, the MSP-1 preparation of the present invention satisfies an unmet need.\n\n\nAs used herein in this and other aspects/embodiments, the term \"MSP-1 preparation\" includes MSP-1 comprising two associated, preferably two non-covalently associated protein subunits or fragments (\"subunit\" and \"fragment\" being used interchangeably throughout the present application), wherein the two protein subunits are not the same. The term \"MSP-1 preparation\" thus encompasses heterodimeric MSP-1. For example, the MSP- 1 subunits p83/30 and p38/42 are different polypeptides which spontaneously associate non-covalently with one another to form an MSP-1 heterodimer with immunological properties, i.e. epitopes, mirroring those of the native MSP-1 heterotetramer. The term \"MSP-1\" may also include incomplete portions of a full MSP-1 protein, for example p83/30 or p38/42 \"halves\" of heterodimeric MSP-1 as well as fragments thereof. In these cases, for purposes of clarity, the respective \"half\" will generally be referred to as an \"MSP-1 fragment\" or an \"MSP-1 subunit\". For purposes of readability, the MSP-1 preparation will be referred to hereinafter simply as \"MSP-1\", but it is understood that \"MSP-1 preparation\" as defined above is meant.\n\n\nAs used herein in this and other aspects/embodiments, the term \"heterologous sequences\" refers to sequences which are not MSP-1 sequences. For example, a part of a polypeptide, for example an extension of a desired polypeptide at the N- and/or C-terminal \n\n end, comprising a region of specific sequence intended to specifically interact with a predetermined binding partner may be considered a \"heterologous sequence\". Such \"isolation tags\" are commonly applied in protein chemistry to aid in the isolation/recovery of recombinantly produced proteins. Examples of commonly used heterologous tags include HiS\n6\n (which chelates divalent nickel), glutathione S-transferase (\"GST\", which binds glutathione), and \"strep\" (8-amino acid tag which binds to engineered streptavidin). As used herein in this and other aspects/embodiments, the term \"heterologous sequence\" also refers to any chemical modification of an expressed protein which is effected with the purpose of enabling protein recovery by selective binding methods. MSP-1 of the present invention comprises no such heterologous sequences.\n\n\nAs used herein in this and other aspects/embodiments, the term \"purified fragment\" (referring to p83/30) refers to a single polypeptide comprising the p83 portion and the p30 portion of MSP-1 of Plasmodium. Preferably, MSP-1 protein comprises a p83/30 fragment from a Plasmodium F-strain or a Plasmodium D-strain. The purified p38/42 fragment is a single polypeptide comprising the p38 portion and the p42 fragment of MSP-1 from\n\n\nPlasmodium. The p38/42 fragment may be derived from any Plasmodium strain, e.g. a D- strain or an F-strain of Plasmodium falciparum.\n\n\nAs used herein in this and other aspects/embodiments, the terms \"p83/30 fragment\" and \"p38/42 fragment\" also refer to modified fragments which have an amino acid sequence identity of at least 90%, preferably of at least 95% and more preferably of at least 98% over the entire length of the polypeptide to a native p83/30 or p38/42 fragment. The terms also encompass truncated fragments which may comprise deletions of single amino acids and/or amino acid portions of up to 10, more preferably up to 5 amino acids compared to the wild- type polypeptide. A p83/30 fragment preferably has a length of at least 800 amino acids, more preferably of at least 850 amino acids. Further, the p83/30 fragment has a sequence identity of at least 90%, more preferably at least 95% and, most preferably, at least 98% with the p83/30 fragment of the P. falciparum F-variant in SEQ ID NO: 3 or the P. falciparum D- variants of either SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2.\n\n\nThe MSP-1 preparation of the present invention as well as compositions comprising the inventive MSP-1 preparation advantageously do not comprise any fragments or other polypeptide products not deriving from the MSP-1 fragments p83, p30, p38 or p42. \n\n According to one embodiment, the heterologous sequence is an isolation tag.\n\n\nAccording to a further embodiment, the purified p83/30 fragment is an F-f ragment, i.e. a fragment derived from an F-strain of Plasmodium, particularly from Plasmodium falciparum strain FCB-1 also known as FC or F. It has been found that the F-fragment is more stable against proteolytic degradation than the D-fragment, i.e. a fragment derived from a D-strain of Plasmodium, particularly from the Plasmodium falciparum strain 3D7 known as NF54. It has also been found that the p83/30 fragment may be combined with a heterologous or a homologous p38/42 fragment, for example with a heterologous p38/42 D- fragment and/or a p38/42 F-fragment.\n\n\nComponents a) and b) are preferably recombinant polypeptides, i.e. polypeptides which have been manufactured in a recombinant host cell, e.g. a eukaryotic host cell such as a yeast cell, e.g. S. cerevisiae or P. pastoris, or in prokaryotic cells, e.g. gram-negative bacterial cells such as E. coli. Preferably, the recombinant host cell is an E. coli cell. More preferably, the host cell is E. coli W3110Z2, for example E. coli W3110Z2-pZE23/d-83/30 (DSM accession number 16602) or W3110Z2-pZE23/d-38/42 (DSM accession number 16600). The DSM numbers represent those assigned by the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures), in Braunschweig, Germany.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment, the p83/30 fragment preferably comprises the amino sequence of an F-strain of P. falciparum as shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 and optionally an N- terminal signal peptide sequence or a modified F-fragment derived from the F-strain sequence. Alternatively, the p83/30 fragment comprises the amino acid sequence of a D- strain of P. falciparum and optionally an N-terminal signal peptide sequence of a modified D- strain sequence. The amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 is derived from the amino acid sequence of a D-strain and comprises 2 amino acid substitutions at positions 612 (E -> K) and 767 (Q -» H). As a further alternative, the p83/30 fragment comprises the amino acid sequence of a D-strain of P. falciparum as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 and optionally an N-terminal signal peptide sequence of a modified D-strain sequence.\n\n\nThe p38/42 fragment may be derived from an F-strain of P. falciparum as shown e.g. in SEQ ID NO: 5 and/or from a D-strain of P. falciparum as shown in SEQ ID NO: 4. It was surprisingly found that a p83/30 fragment of an F-strain may be combined with both a \n\n homologous p38/42 fragment from an F-strain or with a heterologous p38/42 fragment from a different P. falciparum strain, e.g. a D-strain.\n\n\nThe p38/42 fragment preferably has a length of at least 700 amino acids and more preferably at least 750 amino acids. Further, it is preferred that the p38/42 fragment has a sequence identity of at least 90%, more preferably at least 95% and, most preferably, at least 98%, compared to the p38/42 fragments from a P. falciparum F-strain (SEQ ID NO: 5) and/or from a D-strain (SEQ ID NO: 4).\n\n\nThe amino acid sequences of particularly preferred embodiments of p83/30 and p38/42 are shown in SEQ ID NO: 1-5, and preferred combinations of the p83/30 fragment of MSP-1 with the p38/42 fragment of MSP-1 to form heterodimeric MSP-1 are thus as set out in the following Table 1 :\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this and other aspects/embodiments of the present invention, it is preferred that the Plasmodium species is Plasmodium falciparum.\n\n\nIn a further aspect the present invention provides a method for preparing a modified nucleic acid encoding the p83/30 fragment of MSP-1 from Plasmodium having an amino acid sequence as set out in SEQ ID NO: 1 , 2 or 3, said method comprising: \n\n a) Providing an mRNA sequence encoding the p83/30 subunit of MSP-1 from Plasmodium having an amino acid sequence as set out in SEQ ID NO: 1 , 2 or 3;\n\n\nb) Subjecting the region surrounding the start codon of the mRNA sequence of step (a) to analysis in silico to determine the predicted secondary structure of said mRNA sequence;\n\n\nc) Identifying at least one stable, hairpin-like structure in said region surrounding the start codon of step (b);\n\n\nd) Modifying the sequence of the mRNA in said region surrounding the start codon of step (b), wherein at least one nucleotide substitution, insertion, deletion and/or inversion destabilizes said hairpin-like region, and wherein the at least one nucleotide substitution, insertion, deletion and/or inversion is effected in silico so as to encode the same amino acid sequence as encoded by said unmodified nucleic acid sequence;\n\n\ne) Subjecting the region of step (d) to analysis in silico under the same conditions as set out in step (b);\n\n\nf) Determining whether the at least one nucleotide substitution, insertion, deletion and/or inversion destabilizes the at least one hairpin-like region containing the at least one ribosomal binding site;\n\n\ng) Optionally repeating steps (d) - (f) as needed until analysis in silico under the same conditions as set out in step (b) indicates the destabilization of the at least one hairpin-like region;\n\n\nh) Preparing the corresponding modified nucleic acid.\n\n\nPreviously, preparation of sufficient quantities of heterodimeric MSP-1 comprising the MSP-1 protein subunits p83/30 and p38/42 has been limited by the low expression of the p83/30 subunit. The present inventors have effectively removed this bottleneck in the preparation of MSP-1 comprising the p83/30 and p38/42 subunits by determining and eliminating the source of the low expression observed. Specifically, the inventors have determined that the region surrounding the start codon in the unmodified mRNA encoding \n\n the p83/30 subunit of MSP-1 (e.g. with amino acid sequence as set out in SEQ ID NO: 1 , 2 or 3) contains multiple regions of secondary structure, for example hairpin-like regions, which impede recognition by the ribosomal machinery required for translation. By determining which regions of the mRNA exist in stable secondary structure, for example hairpin-like structures, the inventors have determined that targeted modifications to these regions of the nucleic acid sequence can be effected so as to destabilize the secondary structure and render previously inaccessible regions of mRNA available for recognition by ribosomes. Since protein expression levels depend in great part on proper ribosomal recognition of its binding sites on mRNA, rendering these sites more accessible to the ribosome leads to greatly increased expression levels of the corresponding protein, thus eliminating the previously limiting step in the recombinant production of MSP-1.\n\n\nAs used herein in this and other aspects/embodiments, the term \"modified\" refers to the fact that at least one change has been made in the coding nucleotide sequence of a starting nucleic acid, said change resulting in the destabilization of the determined or suspected regions of secondary hairpin-like structure in the corresponding mRNA of this nucleic acid. However, a modified nucleic acid need not be mRNA as such. While the term \"modified nucleic acid\" includes mRNA, it also encompasses a DNA sequence which, when transcribed into mRNA, will have no or at least reduced or different secondary hairpin-like structure in the regions corresponding to ribosomal binding sites, as compared to the corresponding nucleic acid sequence prior to modification. Further, when the modification effected is within the ORF encoding the p83/30 MSP-1 protein subunit, the modification preferably results in a nucleotide triplet which, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, is translated as the same amino acid as would result from translation of the corresponding triplet in unmodified form. This is referred to in this and other aspects/embodiments as a \"silent modification\" or a \"silent mutation\".\n\n\nAs used herein in this and other aspects/embodiments, the term \"region surrounding the start codon\" refers to a window of nucleotides starting at the transcriptional start site, and extending over the AUG start codon about 100-150 nucleotides into the coding region, to comprise a total window length of about 150-200 nucleotides.\n\n\nAs used herein in the present and other aspects, the term \"about\" typically denotes variance of up to and including ±15% (explicitly including all intermediate values of whole or \n\n decimal value between 0-15%), the result of this variance being rounded up or down to the nearest whole number as appropriate.\n\n\nAs used herein in this and other aspects/embodiments, the term \"ribosomal binding site\" refers to stretches of nucleotides known to be bound by ribosomes as part of the process of translating mRNA into an amino acid sequence. The skilled person understands how to recognize these sequences. For example, in prokaryotes the ribosomal binding site, also referred to as the \"Shine-Dalgarno sequence\" or the \"Shine-Dalgarno box\" (after Shine & Dalgarno (1975) Nature 254, 34-8) consists of purine-rich sequences approximately 10 nucleotides upstream of the start codon. The ribosomal binding site sequence used for the expression of the p83/30 fragment of MSP-1 under the present invention corresponds to the Shine-Dalgarno consensus sequence, the ability of which to drive gene expression in E. coli has been previously described (Lutz & Bujard (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25, 1203-10\n\n\nAs used herein in this and other aspects/embodiments, the term \"in silico\" refers to analysis done electronically, for example on a computer using appropriate software for the analysis of nucleic acids and their predicted secondary structure. Suitable software platforms for nucleic acid sequence analysis are known to the skilled person, for example the \"mfold\" program by Zuker and Turner (version 3.2) provided by the web server of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA (Zuker (2003) Nucleic Acids Res. 31 (13), 3406-15; Mathews et al. (1999) J. MoI. Biol. 288, 911 -40). Alternative sources are the \"Vienna RNA package\" (available on the internet under: http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/) or \"RNA world\" at IMB Jena (available on the internet under: http://www.imb-jena.de/RNA.html). The prediction programs used by these servers use the same strategy for structure prediction based on an algorithm for calculating the free minimal energy of polyribonucleotide molecules (see: Stiegler & Zuker (1981) Nucleic Acids Res. 9, 133-48). While the different online resources may apply different optimization packages of this algorithm, analysis results obtained using the mRNA sequence of an MSP- 1 p83/30 fragment subjected to structure prediction by different servers did not deviate from one another significantly with respect to the predicted secondary structure of the RBS. Thus, any of these programs/algorithims may be equivalents used with comparable results. In the online resources mentioned above, default values may be used for the prediction of RNA secondary structure. These default values are designed to reflect conditions in vivo. In \n\n contrast to parameters for the prediction of secondary structure in DNA, parameters for RNA folding cannot be adjusted with the user interface of the \"mfold\" server.\n\n\nAs used herein in this and other aspects/embodiments, the term \"destabilize\" or \"destabilization\" and the like refer to a decrease in the stability, and therefore persistence of, secondary structure such as hairpin-like structure in mRNA as compared to the persistence of secondary structure in the same region when no nucleotide modifications have been carried out. For example, modifying the nucleic acid sequence such that hybridization between two respective nucleotides or nucleotide stretches is disrupted and would be less likely to occur in a modified state as compared to an unmodified state would constitute a \"destabilizing\". As such, \"destabilization\" is not just the result of a lower free energy of the predicted molecule. Rather, it focuses on the secondary structure of the ribosomal binding site, with any involvement in a defined secondary structure being more \"stable\" than an unstructured region. For example, and while not being bound by theory, the present inventors postulate that part of a ribosomal binding site which, in an unmodified sequence, participates in a hairpin-like structure will be less accessible for binding by the ribosome than it will be in a sequence modified so as to reduce the degree of defined structure in this region.\n\n\nAs used herein in this and other aspects/embodiments, the term \"hairpin-like region\" denotes a region in which a first subregion of mRNA in the 5' -> 3' direction forms a stably hybridized structure with a second subregion of mRNA in the 3' -> 5' region, where the first and second subregions each form part of the same contiguous strand of mRNA. In a typical \"hairpin\" or \"stem-loop\" structure, very few nucleotides, typically 5-6 exist between the hybridized first and second subregions participating in the hairpin. In contrast, there is no particular limit to the number of nucleotides which may exist between the first and second hybridized subregions of the \"hairpin-like region\" of the coding mRNA for the MSP-1 p83/30 fragment. As can be seen in appended Fig.1 , very many nucleotides may exist between the first and second subregions of the mRNA participating in the hairpin-like region.\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention provides a composition comprising the above MSP-1 , said MSP-1 comprising\n\n\na) a purified fragment p83/30 of the gp190/MSP-1 from Plasmodium without heterologous sequences, and \n\n b) a purified fragment p38/42 of the gp190/MSP-1 from Plasmodium without heterologous sequences.\n\n\nAccording to one embodiment, the components (a) and (b) in the inventive composition are preferably present in equimolar amounts, e.g. molar ratios of from 1.5:1 to 1 :1.5, more preferably from 1.2:1 to 1 :1.2 and most preferably from about 1 :1 of component (a) to component (b). Preferably, at least 70%, more preferably at least 80% and most preferably at least 90% of the fragments in the composition are present as non-covalently associated dimer.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the composition of the invention has a purity of at least 95% and, more preferably, of at least 97.5%, as determined by SDS gel electrophoresis and silver staining. As used in this and other aspects and embodiments, the term \"purity\" refers to the absence of heterologous polypeptides, i.e. non-MSP-1 polypeptides, e.g. isolation tags.\n\n\nIn a further preferred embodiment, the composition has a content of degradation products of less than 30%, more preferably of less than 20% and most preferably of less than 15%, as measured by SDS gel electrophoresis and immuno-staining. In this context, the term \"degradation products\" refers to polypeptide molecules which result from a degradation of the p83/30 fragment or the p38/42 fragment as described above.\n\n\nA further aspect of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the above MSP-1 , said MSP-1 comprising\n\n\na) a purified fragment p83/30 of the gp190/MSP-1 from Plasmodium without heterologous sequences, and\n\n\nb) a purified fragment p38/42 of the gp190/MSP-1 from Plasmodium without heterologous sequences.\n\n\nIn one embodiment the pharmaceutical composition may additionally comprise pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents and/or adjuvants.\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention provides a modified nucleic acid encoding the p83/30 subunit of MSP-1 from Plasmodium having an amino acid sequence as set out in SEQ ID NO: 1 , 2 or 3, wherein the modified nucleic acid is obtainable by the above method. \n\n A further aspect of the invention provides a vector comprising the modified nucleic acid as set out above.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the vector is a polynucleotide vector, for example a plasmid, for example a plasmid of the pZ series (Lutz & Bujard (1999) Nucleic Acids Res. 25, 1203-10). Other suitable plasmid vectors are known to one of ordinary skill in the art. It is preferred that the polynucleotide vector further comprises a promoter operably linked to the modified nucleic acid encoding the p83/30 fragment of MSP-1 so as to drive transcription thereof. In another embodiment the polynucleotide vector may comprise an inducible promoter such as -\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the vector is a viral vector, for example a vaccinia viral vector, for example modified vaccinia vector Ankara (MVA), an adenovirus such as adenovirus serotype 5, or a measles virus such as an attenuated strain from Edmonton isolate. As is well known to the skilled person, viral vectors such as MVA are suitable for manufacturing safe genetic vaccines in which a nucleic acid or nucleic acids encoding an antigenic polypeptide(s) intended to immunize a subject is/are introduced into the body of subject, where the antigenic polypeptides are then expressed, recognized by the subject's immune system, and lead to the mounting of an innate and/or adaptive immune response against the expressed polypeptide(s). Alternatively, the vector may for example be attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention provides a method of preparing the p83/30 fragment of Plasmodium MSP-1 , said method comprising:\n\n\na) Providing a modified nucleic acid as set out above and/or a vector as set out above;\n\n\nb) Incorporating the modified nucleic acid and/or vector of step (a) into a cell, preferably a prokaryotic cell;\n\n\nc) Incubating the cell of step (b) under conditions allowing expression of the p83/30 fragment of Plasmodium MSP-1 ; and\n\n\nd) Recovering the p83/30 fragment of Plasmodium MSP-1. \n\n The inventors have determined that using a p83/30-encoding nucleic acid sequence modified as described hereinabove (e.g. as set out in SEQ ID NO: 8 or 9) leads to greatly increased expression of the p83/30 fragment of Plasmodium MSP-1 , allowing very efficient production of this protein fragment within the host cell. Without being bound by theory, the inventors believe that the rapid increase in protein levels in a host transfected with the modified nucleic acid sequence as set out above leads to rapid aggregation and precipitation of this protein as inclusion bodies before the translated protein can be subjected to intracellular proteolytic degradation. Accordingly, it is believed that the p83/30 protein produced is rapidly converted into inclusion body form, where the protein remains protected from degradation by endogenous proteolytic enzymes of the host cell.\n\n\nWithout being bound by theory, the inventors thus believe that the amounts of p83/30 fragment protein obtained upon recovery are greater than previously possible for two reasons: First, the use of modified nucleic acid as set out above (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 8 or 9) enables more efficient recognition by ribosomes and initiation of translation than possible for unmodified nucleic acid, where ribosomal recognition sites remain buried in regions of secondary structure. This enables translation to begin more efficiently. Second, once translation of the p83/30 subunit is complete, this protein appears to be converted rapidly to inclusion bodies, where it remains protected from degradation by the host cell until it is recovered.\n\n\nAs used herein in this and other aspects/embodiments, the term \"conditions allowing expression\" denote any environmental conditions known to the skilled person to growth and/or promote protein expression from a chosen host expression system, i.e. a chosen strain of host cell. These conditions may include for example, temperature, light, shaking speed, pH of the medium, nutrient composition of the medium as well as the presence or absence of growth factors, amino acids, vitamins and the like known to promote protein expression in the type of host cell chosen. For example, using E. coll as a host cell for the heterologous preparation of the p83/30 fragment of Plasmodium MSP-1 , suitable conditions may be as set out in the appended Examples, e.g. Example 3.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the recovering step comprises solubilizing the MSP-1 protein subunit from inclusion bodies formed within the host cell. As used herein in this and other aspects/embodiments, the term \"inclusion bodies\" refers to protein aggregates in the cytoplasm of bacteria that are formed by heterologously expressed genes. For many \n\n recombinant proteins the environment in the prokaryotic cytoplasm is not suitable for proper protein folding, particularly when the protein is present at high concentration due to overexpression. The proteins precipitate and form large protein aggregates termed \"inclusion bodies\" that can be identified microscopically as high molecular weight structures inside the bacteria. Protein in the inclusion bodies is usually not present in its natural conformation and must therefore be refolded in vitro Uom inclusion bodies before it can function properly. As the information for refolding is contained in the amino acid sequence of a protein, refolding procedures differ for each protein and need to be established in detail on a case-by-case basis, as dictated by the particular protein expressed and present as inclusion bodies. Nevertheless, certain basic parameters have been identified which are advantageous for the folding of a wide variety of proteins (see for example Rudolph et al. (1997) Protein function: A practical approach. Ed. T.E. Creighton). One of ordinary skill in the art understands how to apply these general parameters (e.g. choice of renaturation buffers) to the isolation and refolding of protein in the form of inclusion bodies.\n\n\nThe inventors have found that one particularly efficient method for renaturing solubilized inclusion bodies of MSP-1 proteins (both p83/30 and p38/42 fragments thereof) involves pulsing the solution containing the solubilized inclusion bodies. In this sense, \"pulsing\" refers to the addition of the respective protein solution into a renaturation buffer in which refolding is to take place. This process is termed \"pulse renaturation\" and has been described previously (Rudolph & Lillie (1996) FASEB J. 10, 49-56). Briefly, small amounts of denatured proteins are added (i.e. \"pulsed\") into a renaturation buffer in separate aliquots, spaced by time intervals, e.g. at least one hour. During a respective interval, protein folding can occur at low concentrations, thereby decreasing the probability of aggregation. For example, instead of adding 1 mg of protein to the renaturation solution all at once, it can be advantageous to add the protein gradually, in smaller amounts or \"pulses\", for example stirring shortly before, during and shortly following a respective pulse. In this way, for example, 10 individual additions of 0.1 mg of protein each may be added over, for example, 10 hours; one pulse per hour briefly preceded and followed by stirring, and with the solution being allowed to incubate at rest prior to the next respective addition of protein. Refolded protein does not interfere with the renaturation of additional protein which has not yet refolded. \n\n In the renaturation of p83/30 and p38/42 fragments of Plasmodium MSP-1 , the inventors have found it particularly advantageous to add protein in intervals of about one hour, a time span which has been previously shown to allow a wide variety of proteins to refold. For the application, or \"pulsing\", of protein, any device allowing the addition of a defined volume of solution may be used, e.g. automated pipettor. The inventors have found it to be particularly advantageous to stir the solution about one minute before, during and about one minute after a respective protein addition. These procedure settings, as well as the approximate one hour time interval between respective protein additions, have been previously described (Rudolph & Lillie (1996) FASEB J. 10, 49-56).\n\n\nSuch pulse-renaturation techniques are especially applicable to large scale preparatory processes of the type needed for preparing the large amounts of MSP-1 subunits required for the manufacture of vaccines. Further, in the event that host cells are transfected with nucleic acid encoding only the p83/30 MSP-1 protein subunit, then the inclusion bodies should contain only this protein, meaning that it can be efficiently isolated from the cell lysate by standard physical separation techniques (such as centrifugation). The high-yield, inclusion body-forming process developed and implemented by the inventors thus allows efficient isolation of the p83/30 MSP-1 protein subunit in a way which completely avoids any dependence on isolation tags.\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention provides a p83/30 subunit of the MSP-1 protein obtainable by the corresponding preparation method set out above. As explained above, previous attempts to prepare amounts of MSP-1 protein fragment p83/30 sufficient for technical scale preparation of a vaccine failed due to a) low heterologous expression levels and b) proteolytic degradation by the host cell of the small amounts expressed. The vastly improved yields of MSP-1 subunit p83/30 of the present invention are the result of the inventors' recognition of which types of modifications need to be effected in nucleic acid encoding this protein subunit. These modifications allow more efficient, rapid expression of the p83/30 protein product. The rapid production of this protein in host cells leads to the accumulation of inclusion bodies, in which form the p83/30 subunit remains protected from degradation by the host cell. Since the p83/30 subunit is present in large quantities in easily separable inclusion bodies, it is isolable in highly pure form using standard physical separation techniques such as centrifugation, avoiding the need to rely on isolation tags for protein recovery. \n\n The inventors' recognition of the need for specific expression-enhancing modifications in the nucleic acid encoding the p83/30 subunit of MSP-1 thus in effect eliminates the one step which has hitherto hampered technical scale preparation of MSP-1 heterodimers comprising this subunit. At the same time, GMP-compliant protein is obtained which can be submitted to the appropriate regulatory agencies for approval as an administrable protein therapeutic.\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention provides a method of preparing a Plasmodium MSP-1 containing composition, said method comprising:\n\n\na) Expressing the fragment p83/30 of the gp190/MSP-1 protein from Plasmodium without heterologous sequences in a host cell;\n\n\nb) Expressing the fragment p38/42 of the gp190/MSP-1 protein from Plasmodium without heterologous sequences in a host cell;\n\n\nc) Recovering the fragment p83/30 and the fragment p38/42 from the host cells; and\n\n\nd) Optionally combining the fragments p83/30 and p38/42 in a composition or as a combined preparation.\n\n\nThe expression of the fragments p83/30 and p38/42 may be carried out in a single host cell or separately in a first host cell and in a second host cell. The use of separate first and second host cells is preferred. The host cell may be provided by transfection with a nucleic acid encoding the respective MSP-1 fragment. Preferably, the nucleic acid encoding the p83/30 fragment and the nucleic acid encoding the p38/42 fragment may be located on an expression vector suitable for the respective host cell, e.g. a gram-negative bacterial cell such as an E. coli cell. The expression vector may be an episomal vector such as a plasmid, or a chromosomally integrated vector. The expression vector comprises the nucleic acid in operative linkage with a suitable expression control sequence, e.g. which may comprise a constitutive or an inducible promoter. The expression vector may comprise further genetic elements, e.g. an origin of replication, a selection marker, etc. Examples of suitable cloning vectors are disclosed in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (1989), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, and other standard textbooks. \n\n When the host cells are bacterial cells, e.g. E. coli cells, the fragments are preferably expressed in insoluble form, e.g. as inclusion bodies, which are discussed hereinabove. Preferably, the fragments are separately recovered as inclusion bodies which may be separately solubilized, e.g. in the presence of chaotropic salts such as guanidinium hydrochloride and subsequently refolded, e.g. in the presence of arginine and thiol reagents such as glutathione. Alternatively, the p83/30 and p38/42 fragments may be combined before solubilization, after solubilization or after refolding in a suitable molar ratio. The pulsed renaturation techniques discussed hereinabove may be used in this regard. After refolding, the fragments are transferred to a suitable buffer which may comprise a non-ionic surfactant such as Tween 80, Tween 20 or Triton X-100. If desired. The fragments may be separately purified by subsequent processing steps, comprising at least one of the following: filtration, anion and/or cation exchange chromatography such as Q-sepharose HP- chromatography, or SP-sepharose HP-chromatography, conditioning and concentration, e.g. by ultrafiltration.\n\n\nAccording to step (d), the fragments are combined. Preferably, the fragments are combined in about equimolar amounts as indicated above. The amount of the respective fragment may be determined by quantitative SDS-PAGE performed under reducing conditions. It is especially preferred that the fragments are combined in the absence of heterologous polypeptides such as albumin.\n\n\nAfter combining, the fragments may be further purified, e.g. by size exclusion chromatography, e.g. using Sephacryl S 300-HR/GE. Further treatments may comprise filtration, concentration and sterilization, e.g. by sterile filtration.\n\n\nThe nucleic acids encoding the fragments p83/30 and p38/42 may have reduced AT- content compared to the wild type sequence as described in WO 98/14583, which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nGenerally, efficient production of the p38/42 fragment, e.g. having an amino acid sequence as set out in SEQ ID NO: 4 or 5 does not suffer from the same problems of low yield observed when producing the p83/30 fragment from unmodified nucleic acid. As used herein, \"unmodified nucleic acid\" denotes nucleic acid which, with respect to the coding sequence for the individual MSP-1 subunits p83 and p30 in a single polypeptide chain, corresponds to the native nucleic acid sequences (or native nucleic acid sequences which \n\n have been previously modified to increase stability as for example disclosed in WO 98/14583 and Pan et al. (1999) Nucleic Acids Res. 27(4), 1094-103) for the respective subunits in Plasmodium, preferably in P. falciparum. Generally, it should thus be possible to use a nucleic acid comprising native, unmodified sequences encoding the p38 and p42 subunits to efficiently produce the MSP-1 fragment p38/42. However, corresponding modification of the nucleic acid encoding the p38/42 fragment of MSP-1 may be carried out in a fashion analogous to that described above for the p83/30 fragment if desired, expedient or necessary. The advantages described above for the p83/30 fragment of MSP-1 , for example efficient production in the form of inclusion bodies and omission of any heterologous sequences, e.g. isolation tags, thus also apply to the p38/42 subunit as well.\n\n\nThe inventors have determined that the two MSP-1 subunit fragments p83/30 and p38/42 spontaneously refold and associate under suitable conditions. This is especially the case when the fragments have previously been resolubilized out of inclusion body form. These conditions are described in detail herein. As such, it is possible to efficiently construct heterodimeric MSP-1 protein comprising the synthetic MSP-1 subunits p83/30 and p38/42 in a single concerted process without the need for prior yield-lowering refolding procedures for the individual subunits. The yield of the resulting MSP-1 protein is thus maximized. Further, since refolding and reassembly of MSP-1 take place spontaneously, traditional column- based protein isolation procedures may in most cases be dispensed with and, with them, the need for isolation tags of any sort, as described hereinabove. Of course, such column purification methods as described herein above may still be employed if desired.\n\n\nAs used herein in this and other aspects/embodiments, \"mixing\" or \"combining\" denotes bringing the p83/30 and p38/42 subunit fragments of MSP-1 into contact with one another under conditions which promote heterodimer formation. Suitable conditions to this end are described hereinbelow.\n\n\nOne very advantageous feature of this aspect of the invention is that the two \"halves\" of MSP-1 , i.e. the p83/30 and p38/42 fragments may be brought together as solubilized but non-refolded inclusion bodies to form complete MSP-1. Thus this embodiment avoids the need for separate refolding of the individual p83/30 and p38/42 subunits prior to mixing with one another. A solution containing both of the solubilized but still unfolded protein subunits may then be treated so that the individual subunits gradually renature or \"refold\" with one another, spontaneously reassembling the full, correctly folded MSP-1 heterodimer as they \n\n do. As indicated above, it is advantageous to combine the two subunits in stoichiometric, or near-stoichiometric amounts (i.e. in a ratio of 1 :1 or close to 1 :1). As such, the protein concentrations of the inclusion body preparations of the respective MSP-1 fragments should be determined in advance of mixing. The ability to reconstitute the MSP-1 heterodimer in one concerted step starting from still insoluble inclusion bodies thus eliminates any need to renature each of the subunits separately prior to mixing, a process which can incur product loss. As such, the possibility of mixing the individual protein subunits without any other prior treatment steps than recovery of inclusion bodies (and their optional prior solubilization) thus exploits the high protein yields obtained for the p83/30 subunit by appropriate nucleic acid modification and for the p38/42 by using the native or modified Plasmodium sequences to the maximum extent possible.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the constituent p83/30 and p38/42 subunits of the MSP-1 heterodimer may be incorporated into the same or different cells, preferably prokaryotic cells. However, It is preferred in one embodiment that the combining step above is performed such that the p83/30 and p38/42 subunits are mixed in an approximate stoichiometric ratio of 1 :1 in relation to one another. To this end, it is preferred that the p83/30 and p38/42 subunits of the MSP-1 heterodimer be expressed from separate cells. This enables a greater degree of experimental control in adjusting the stoichiometric ratio in which the protein subunits are later mixed such that this ratio is as close to 1:1 as possible.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the individual subunit inclusion bodies are solubilized separately, i.e. in separate solutions prior to mixing for reassembly. One can then determine their respective amounts in solution, and combine appropriate amounts of each solution to reconstitute an entire MSP-1. In one preferred embodiment, the two solutions containing the p83/30 and p38/42 subunits can be added as metered aliquots, i.e. \"pulses\" into one mixture solution, as discussed above. In one particularly preferred embodiment, the inventors have found that the reconstitution, i.e. reassembly of the MSP-1 heterodimer from its respective p83/30 and p38/42 halves may be promoted by timing the respective additions in the approximate middle of stirring periods lasting about 2 minutes. That is to say, following a respective incubation during which protein renaturation has been allowed to take place, the solution is gently stirred for about 1 minute. Stirring continues during protein addition, and stirring is continued for about one further minute. After this period, stirring is stopped and the \n\n solution is allowed to incubate at rest for a predetermined time period, advantageously. Following this rest period, the process is repeated until all available protein has been added.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the p83/30 and p38/42 subunits are not renatured prior to the mixing step, but rather are added to one another in denatured form, as already described above. For example, the denatured form may include inclusion bodies which have been recovered from a cell lysate by centrif ugation and resuspended (but not renatured) prior to the mixing step. In one embodiment, the mixture solution containing denatured p83/30 and p38/42 is subjected to the same type of pulse treatment as described above.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, one of the two protein subunits of the MSP-1 heterodimer is refolded prior to being mixed with the other of the two subunits, the latter being still denatured and soluble or insoluble upon mixing. Here, as above, a pulsing process may be employed to solubilize the as yet unsoluble subunit (if needed), and simultaneously promote association of the two protein subunits into correctly folded MSP-1.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, actual recovery of the MSP-1 heterodimer can be accomplished for example by diafiltration or dialysis with salt exchange to any buffer desired without the need of including stabilizing components such as BSA or HSA. A range of different buffers may be used, as required for subsequent purification and formulation processes.\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention provides an MSP-1 from Plasmodium as set out above, the modified nucleic acid as set out above, the vector as set out above, the MSP-1 fragment p83/30 as set out above (e.g. any of SEQ ID NO: 1 , 2 or 3) or an MSP-1 fragment p38/42 (e.g. any of SEQ ID NO: 4 or 5) for use as a vaccine.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, the fully reconstituted MSP-1 heterodimer as well as the individual p83/30 and p38/42 protein subunits thereof are capable of eliciting an immune response when brought into contact with the immune system of a host, i.e. the immune system of an animal or a human. Especially preferred to this end is the use of the MSP-1 heterodimer comprising both the p83/30 and p38/42 subunits, as the heterodimer will present the host immune system with epitopes most closely matching those of the native MSP-1 heterotetramer. However, also preferred is the use of either of the protein subunits p83/30 or p38/42 to this end, as these will present the host immune system with certain epitopes equivalent to those in heterodimeric MSP-1. \n\n In one embodiment, the vaccine comprises a pharmacologically compatible carrier, i.e. adjuvant. Pharmacologically compatible adjuvants in this respect are all carriers and agents known in the art to enhance the immune response. Preferred adjuvants in this regard include aluminium oxide and aluminum phosphate carriers, each with or without additional stimulating compounds such as MPL\n1\n ISA 720 and ISA 51 from Seppich SA, IC31 from lntercell or MF59.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the vaccine is suitable for administration by injection, for example intradermal, intramuscular or subcutaneous. In general, however, any route of administration known to lead to an immune response in vaccine administration may be used to administer the inventive vaccine.\n\n\nThe vaccine may be prepared as a reconstitutible lypphilisate, as a liquid, e.g. as a solution or a suspension, or as an emulsion, e.g. as a water-in-oil emulsion. A preferred dosage of the vaccine comprises 1-500 μg, more preferably 20-100 μg for application in human medicine. The vaccine may be administered in a single dose or in multiple doses. The administration in multiple doses is preferred. Doses of 100 μg are especially preferred.\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention provides a use of MSP-1 from Plasmodium as set out above, the modified nucleic acid as set out above, the vector as set out above, the MSP-1 fragment p83/30 as set out above (e.g. any of SEQ ID NO: 1 , 2 or 3) and/or an MSP-1 fragment p38/42 (e.g. any of SEQ ID NO: 4 or 5) in the manufacture of a medicament for preventing and/or treating malaria.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the medicament is prepared for administration together with an adjuvant, wherein exemplary adjuvants are as set out above. Exemplary routes and amounts of administration are also as set out above.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the medicament is prepared for administration together with ISA720. The inventors have surprisingly found that the administration of MSP-1 comprising the protein subunits p83/30 and p38/42 (each without heterologous sequences) to animals leads to an unusually high antibody titer, as evidenced by a) comparison with titers obtained using Freund's complete/incomplete adjuvant, the most potent adjuvant known, and b) examination of the specificity of the antibodies obtained (high titers of antibodies were obtained also against the low immunogenicity regions p30 and p38). Thus, the modifications made in the p83/30-encoding nucleic acid not only allow production of the \n\n corresponding subunit for the first time in acceptable yield and free of any isolation tags, but also the finding of a beneficial antigen/adjuvant combination resulting in a promising formulation of MSP-1 from Plasmodium, together with the adjuvant ISA720.\n\n\nThe embodiments above in the context of pharmaceutically compatible carriers/adjuvants/diluents as well as administration routes and amounts apply to this aspect of the invention mutatis mutandi.\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention provides a vaccine comprising MSP-1 from Plasmodium as set out above, the modified nucleic acid as set out above, the vector as set out above, the MSP-1 fragment p83/30 as set out above (e.g. any of SEQ ID NO: 1 , 2 or 3) and/or the MSP-1 fragment p38/42 (e.g. any of SEQ ID NO: 4 or 5).\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention refers to a composition comprising a purified fragment p83/30 of the gp190/MSP-1 protein from a Plasmodium F-strain. The p83/30 fragment preferably comprises the sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 or a modified sequence as described above. This composition is preferably used as a pharmaceutical preparation, e.g. as a vaccine as described above. With regard to the preferred characteristics, e.g. purity and/or content of degradation products, of this composition, reference is made to the disclosure as described above.\n\n\nThe embodiments above in the context of pharmaceutically compatible carriers/adjuvants/diluents as well as administration routes and amounts apply to this aspect of the invention mutatis mutandi.\n\n\nThe invention will now be illustrated by way of the following non-limiting examples.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nExample 1 : Mutation of nucleic acid sequences encoding MSP-1 protein subunits In prokaryotes the ribosome binding site, also referred to as \"Shine-Dalgamo-sequence\", consists of purine-rich sequences approximately 10 nucleotides upstream of the start codon. The ribosomal binding site sequence in the plasm id pZE23/d-83/30 used for the expression of the recombinant MSP-1 proteins corresponds to the \"Shine-Dalgano\" consensus sequence (Shine & Dalgarno (1975) Nature 254, 34-8) and its capacity of driving gene expression in E. coli had been described previously (Lutz & Bujard (1997) Nucleic Acids \n\n Res. 25, 1203-10). Due to the fact that in prokaryotes translation of mRNA into protein takes place while transcription is still ongoing, the secondary structure of the mRNA might influence the recognition of the mRNA by ribosomes and, as a consequence, the rate of protein synthesis.\n\n\nIn light of the above, in silico analysis of the mRNA structure was performed by submitting about the first 150-200 bp of the mRNA encoding p83/30 (i.e. the first 150-200 bp of either of SEQ ID NO: 6 or 7) to the RNA structure prediction program \"mfold\" (version 3.2) provided as an online resource by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY (Zuker (2003) Nucleic Acids Res. 31 (13), 3406-15; http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/). Default values were used for the prediction of RNA secondary structure. These default values are designed to reflect conditions in vivo. In contrast to parameters for the prediction of secondary structure in DNA, parameters for RNA folding cannot be adjusted with the user interface of the \"mfold\" server. SEQ ID NO: 6 and 7 are shown in Figs. 15 and 16, respectively.\n\n\nThe predicted structure of the ribosomal binding site was found to contain a hairpin-like structure, which might restrict access of ribosome (see Fig.1). It was hypothesized that by modifying the secondary structure of the mRNA such that the ribosomal binding site is no longer part of a structurally well-defined region, such as the hairpin-like structure, ribosomal access to the mRNA might be facilitated, thus promoting synthesis of recombinant MSP-1 in the bacteria.\n\n\nTo this end, several mutations were introduced into sequences interacting with the ribosome in order to destabilize the hairpin-like structure. The modified sequences were again subjected to computational analysis and showed the expected effect of the mutations, i.e. the structure of the ribosomal binding site was no longer part of a hairpin-like structure.\n\n\nFollowing this computational prediction, two different sets of the computed mutations were introduced by site-specific mutagenesis into the p83/30-encoding nucleic acids. Sequences with either set of mutations as well as a sequence containing both sets of mutations were finally cloned and all lead to improved MSP-1 expression as compared to the original sequence. The sequence containing both sets of mutations proved to be most effective and was then used for the expression of p83/30. Both sets of mutations are present in SEQ ID NO: 8 and 9 in identical form (see Figs 17 and 18). These mutations relative to the parental \n\n nucleic acid sequences of SEQ ID NO: 6 and 7, respectively, are silent mutations, meaning that they do not lead to modifications at the amino acid level. The nucleotides in SEQ ID NO: 8 and 9 which were mutated relative to SEQ ID NO: 6 and 7 are emphasized in respective SEQ ID NO: 8 and 9 in lower case boldface, and the start codon ATG is underlined (see Figs. 17 and 18).\n\n\nExample 2: Comparison of expression of non-mutated with mutated MSP-1 subunits.\n\n\nE. coli W3110-Z2 containing pZE23/d-83/30 (unmodified sequence for the p83/30 fragment, corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 6 or 7, in which the ribosomal binding sites are identical) or pZE23/d-mut83/30 (modified sequence for the p83/30 fragment, corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 8 or 9, in which the ribosomal binding sites have been identically modified) were grown in Superbroth medium at 37°C to a cell density of OD500 = 0.5. MSP-1 expression was induced by addition of IPTG (1 mM) and bacteria were grown for an additional 4 hours. Aliquots of whole bacterial extracts were taken at the time of induction (0 h) and after 2 (2h) and 4 hours (4h), respectively. Whole cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 2.\n\n\nExample 3: Production of heterodimeric MSP-1 from p83/30 and P38/42\n\n\nExample 3a: Production of host cells with translationallv optimized P83/30 and P38/42 CaCI\n2\n-COm petent E. coli W3110Z2 are transformed with plasmids pZE23/mut-d-83/30 and pZE23/d38/42. E.coli host strains W3110Z2-pZE23/d83/30 and W3110Z2-pZE23/d38/42 are grown separately, but under identical conditions: in Superbroth at 37\n0\nC. At cell densities of OD600 = 7, synthesis of the MSP-1 subunits is induced by addition of lsopropyl beta-D-1- thiogalactopyranoside (\"IPTG\"; final concentration 1 mM). At OD = 18-24 cells are harvested by centrifugation and either stored at - 80\n0\nC or immediately processed further. The results are shown in Fig. 3 for the expression of p83/30 and p38/42 fragments from mutated and non-mutated nucleic acid sequences, respectively.\n\n\nExample 3b: Expression of P83/30 and p38/42 subunits\n\n\nFermentations of the two E. coli host strains W3110Z2-pZE23/d83/30 and W3110Z2- pZE23/d38/42 were carried out separately, but under identical conditions: in Superbroth at 37°C. At cell densities of OD600 = 7 synthesis of the MSP-1 fragments was induced by \n\n addition of IPTG (final concentration 1 mM). At OD = 18-24 cells are harvested by centrifugation and either stored at - 8O\n0\nC or immediately processed further. The results of the fermentation are shown in Fig. 4.\n\n\nExample 3c: Recovery and solubilization of P83/30 and P38/42 subunits from inclusion bodies\n\n\nCells from fermetation or from frozen biomass were suspended in lysis buffer at 4°C and opened via a f luidizer at 1.034x10\n5\n - 1.379x10\n5\n kPa (15,000 - 20,000 psi). Centrifugation at 27,000 g was performed for 20 min. The pellet contained the inclusion bodies. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, lysozyme, Dnase), and centrifugation was repeated. The pellet was harvested and subjected to another cycle of resuspension and centrifugation. The final concentration of inclusion bodies was 500 mg/L bacterial culture. The inclusion bodies collected in the pellet were dissolved in solubilization buffer (6 M guanidinium hydrochloride, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 10 mM DTT, 1mM EDTA) while stirring at room temperature for 10 hours. Centrifugation at 27,000 g for 40 min cleared the solution of dissolved inclusion bodies. Fig. 5 shows electrophoretic analysis of solubilized inclusion bodies.\n\n\nExample 3d: Mixing and renaturation of p83/30 and P38/42 to form reassembled MSP-1 heterodimer\n\n\nThe content of the MSP-1 fragments p83/30 and p38/42 in their respective solubilized inclusion body preparations was determined by electrophoretic analysis of a dilution series of both preparations. These determinations are important for calculating the volumes of the two preparations to be combined during the pulse renaturing process. Both subunits were added to the renaturation buffer (500 mM arginine, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM glutathione) in ten equal aliquots, such that the final concentration was 0.5 mg/mL renatured heterodimer at the end of the renaturation process.\n\n\nThe individual aliquots were added to the renaturing buffer in the following way: The solution was stirred for 1 min before, during and after each addition, i.e. \"pulse\" of protein. About 1 hour was allowed to elapse between stopping stirring following one addition and starting stirring prior to the next respective addition. Following the last addition, the solution was incubated for an additional 10 hrs. The entire process was temperature controlled at 10\n0\nC. \n\n Following incubation, the protein solution was centrifuged or diafiltered at 4°C. The buffer was exchanged by diafiltration. Protein recovery was 99%.\n\n\nExample 3e: Purification of the reconstituted MSP-1 heterodimeric protein\n\n\nThe renatured MSP-1 heterodimer comprising both the p83/30 and p38/42 fragments without heterologous polypeptide sequences such as isolation tags was subjected to three chromatographic fractionation processes: HP-Q sepharose chromatography (AP Biotech), hydroxyapatite chromatograohy, macroprep Type I (BioRad), and HP-SP sepharose chromatography (AP Biotech).\n\n\nThe overall yield and purity of the MSP-1 Heterodimer per 100 L fermentation volume was 8 gm of MSP-1. This is an amount of MSP-1 sufficient for 80,000 doses of 100 μg each. The end product contained less than 1 ng of E. coli protein per 1 mg of MSP-1.\n\n\nAbout 85% of the final material consists of intact MSP-1 heterodimeric protein. The end- product contained about 15% of so-called product-derived impurities. These impurities are the product sensitivity to protease. Of the two fragments p83/30 and p38/42, it was primarily the p83/30 subunit which showed such sensitivity to protease. The degradation products (see Fig. 6) appear to constitute parts of incomplete heterodimers, as they cannot be separated from the complex. All detectable components of the purified MSP-1 preparation can be identified as degradation products of MSP-1 (Fig. 6), as determined using appropriate antibodies specific for the p83/30 and p38/42 fragments of MSP-1.\n\n\nExample 4: Immunogenics studies lmmunogenicity of an antigen strongly depends on (1) the way it is formulated, i.e. with which adjuvant it is combined; (2) the immunization regimen, i.e. the way it is administered (for example, subcutaneously, s.c. or intramuscularly, i.m.); (3) the number of immunizations carried out; and (4) the temporal sequence of the immunizations.\n\n\nIn the present study, examination of adjuvants was limited to those which are suitable for use in humans. Freud's complete and incomplete adjuvant (FCA, FIA), a very potent adjuvant not accepted for use in humans, was used as a positive control. A further control was pure antigen in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). \n\n A first set of immunizations was carried out in a mouse model. Antigen/adjuvant combinations which showed a high immunogenicity in these animals as verified by high titers of MSP-1 -specific antibodies were subsequently examined in rabbits.\n\n\nExample 4a: Immunization in BaIb c mice\n\n\nGroups of seven animals were injected with the antigen/adjuvant combination containing 5 μg of antigen per dose. Three subcutaneous injections were performed on days 0, 21 and 42. On day 63, animals were bled and final serum was harvested. Antibody titers were determined via ELISA using MSP-1 heterodimer as capture protein.\n\n\nImmunizations were carried out with the following adjuvants: aluminum hydroxide; aluminum phosphate; MPL (Sigma); CpG (Qiagen); IC31 (Intercell, Vienna, Austria); Montanide ISA 720 (Seppich, Paris, France); Montanide 51 (Seppich); Virosomes (Berna Biotech, Bern, Switzerland); and FCA/FIA.\n\n\nResults of this study are shown in Fig.7. The identities of the individual clusters of the data bars A-Y are as set out in the corresponding description of Fig. 7 hereinabove. Importantly, data cluster A represents antigen administered in PBS, data cluster A represents antigen administered in FCA/FIA. As can be seen in Fig.7, data clusters K (corresponding to the adjuvant X3), S (corresponding to the adjuvant Montanide ISA720) and T (corresponding to the adjuvant Montanide ISA51) resulted in the highest antibody titers of all test formulations. Based on these results, MSP-1 and MSP-1 -related antigen was subsequently administered with each of these three adjuvants to rabbits.\n\n\nExample 4b: Immunization of rabbits\n\n\nGroups of five rabbits were injected intramuscularly with four doses of formulated antigen (100 μg per dose). Immunizations were performed on days 0, 28, 42 and 56. On day 70 animals were bled and sera were harvested. The titer of MSP-1 -specific antibodies was measured via ELISA using MSP-1 heterodimer as well as the 4 subunits p83, p30, p38, and p42 as capture proteins. Results are shown in Fig. 8.\n\n\nAs Figs. 7 and 8 each show, there exist several promising antigen/adjuvant combinations and further studies are likely to reveal additional candidates. Present data indicate, however, \n\n that the combination of MSP-1 heterodimer with Montanide ISA 720 is particularly promising, for two surprising reasons:\n\n\n(1) The antibody titer obtained in rabbits surpasses the combination of MSP-1 with Freund's adjuvant.\n\n\n(2) The titer of antibodies when analyzed using the four subunits of MSP-1 show a most interesting profile. Titers against p30 and p38 are unusually high in comparison to those specific for p83 and p42. As the two subunits p30 and p38 elicit antibodies which are particularly effective in inhibiting parasite growth, the outcome of this study is particularly promising."
