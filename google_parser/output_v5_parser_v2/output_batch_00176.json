Background technique \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 中药莪术为姜科植物蓬莪术 Curcuma phaeocaulis Val .广西莪术 C.kwangsinensis S.G.Lee et C.F. Liang.和温郁金 C.wenyujinY.H.chen et C.Ling 的干燥根茎， 含挥发油 1%~2.5%。 其挥发油主要化学成分为萜类化合物， 如莪术醇、 莪术酮、 莪术烯等。 经现 代药理研究证明它具有一定的抗菌、 抗癌活性。 \n Chinese herbal medicine is the ginger plant Puccinia Curcuma phaeocaulis Val. Guangxi C. kwangsinensis S.G.Lee et C.F. Liang. and Wen Yujin C.wenyujinY.H.chen et C.Ling dry rhizome, containing volatile oil 1%~2.5%. The main chemical components of volatile oils are terpenoids, such as curcumol, curcumin, and curcumene. It has been proved to have certain antibacterial and anticancer activities by modern pharmacological studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 莪术挥发油一直是采取水蒸气蒸熘法提取， 挥发油的成分复杂。 这给下一步莪术油 挥发油的有效成分分离带来难度。 又因为挥发油中主要有效成分是萜类， 加热的温度和 时间会影响有效成分， 如温度过高或时间过长会引起其发生分解与转换。 \n The volatile oil of Rhizoma Curcumae has always been extracted by steam distillation, and the composition of volatile oil is complicated. This makes it difficult to separate the active ingredients of the volatile oil from the zedoary turmeric oil. Moreover, because the main active ingredient in volatile oil is terpenoids, the temperature and time of heating will affect the active ingredients. If the temperature is too high or the time is too long, it will cause decomposition and conversion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 蓬莪术环二烯首次由日本的 Hikiw,H 等人于 1968 年报道， 其化学名称为：\n The first time was reported by Hikiw, H et al. in Japan in 1968. Its chemical name is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n(5E，9Z) -3，6， 10-三 甲基 -4， 7， 8， 11-四氢化芳癸并 [b] 呋喃， 英文化学名 ： Cyclodeca [b] furan, 4， 7， 8， 1 l-tetrahydro-3, 6， 10-trimethyl- (5E, 9Z)。 \n(5E,9Z) -3,6, 10-trimethyl-4, 7, 8, 11-tetrahydroindenyl[b]furan, English chemical name: Cyclodeca [b] furan, 4, 7, 8, 1 l-tetrahydro-3, 6, 10-trimethyl- (5E, 9Z).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 化学结构式为： \n The chemical structural formula is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 分子式为: 分子量为： 216. 15 \n The molecular formula is: The molecular weight is: 216. 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 本品的理化性质： 白色结晶性粉末。 无臭， 无味， 在无水乙醇， 丙酮， 氯仿中易溶， 难溶于水。 \n Physical and chemical properties of this product: white crystalline powder. Odorless, tasteless, soluble in anhydrous ethanol, acetone, chloroform, difficult to dissolve in water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 蓬莪术环二烯不稳定， 遇热容易分解， 变黄。 莪术挥发油一直是采取水蒸气蒸熘法 提取， 挥发油的成分复杂。 这给下一步莪术油挥发油的有效成分分离带来难度。 又因为 挥发油中主要有效成分是萜类， 加热的温度和时间会影响有效成分， 如温度过高或时间 过长会引起其发生分解与转换。 蓬莪术环二烯是莪术挥发油中的主要成分， 但目前尚没 有能够大量制备该化合物的方法和简单分离方法。 \n\n 在配制药物组合物过程中， 药物成为一种便于操作和加工的形态是十分重要的。 无 论是从获得一种可以产业化的生产方法的角度， 还是从后来生产含有所述活性化合物的 药用组合物的角度出发， 这点都是非常重要的。 所述活性成分的化学稳定性、 固态稳定 性和储存期限也是非常重要的因素。 药物和包含它的组合物应该能够有效地储存超过可 评估的时间周期， 所述活性成分的物理一化学特征 （如它的化学组成、 密度、 引湿性和 溶解性） 没有出现显著的变化。 此外， 能够以尽可能纯的形式提供药物也是重要的。 无 定型物质在这点上可能存在问题。 例如， 此类物质比起结晶型物质来稳定性较差， 或是 纯度较低。 如果可以简单地以稳定的晶型获得药物， 则可解决以上问题。 另外， 结晶状 态良好的晶型有可能在制成口服制剂后， 明显增加该物质的生物利用度， 改善其在体内 的药物代谢动力学性质， 进而增强其药理活性。 \nThe ring-shaped diene is unstable, and it is easily decomposed and yellow when exposed to heat. The volatile oil of Rhizoma Curcumae has always been extracted by steam distillation, and the composition of volatile oil is complicated. This makes it difficult to separate the active ingredients of the volatile oil from the zedoary turmeric oil. Moreover, because the main active ingredient in volatile oil is terpenoids, the temperature and time of heating will affect the active ingredients. If the temperature is too high or the time is too long, it will cause decomposition and conversion. The ring-shaped diene is the main component in the volatile oil of Rhizoma Curcumae, but there is currently no method and a simple separation method capable of preparing the compound in large quantities.  It is important that the drug be in a form that is easy to handle and process during the formulation of the pharmaceutical composition. This is very important from the standpoint of obtaining an industrially produced production method or from the subsequent production of a pharmaceutical composition containing the active compound. The chemical stability, solid state stability and shelf life of the active ingredient are also very important factors. The drug and compositions comprising it should be capable of being effectively stored for more than an evaluable period of time, with no significant changes in the physical-chemical characteristics of the active ingredient, such as its chemical composition, density, wettability and solubility. In addition, it is also important to be able to provide the drug in as pure a form as possible. Amorphous substances may have problems at this point. For example, such materials are less stable than crystalline materials or have lower purity. The above problem can be solved if the drug can be obtained simply in a stable crystal form. In addition, a crystal form having a good crystal state may significantly increase the bioavailability of the substance after preparation into an oral preparation, improve its pharmacokinetic properties in vivo, and thereby enhance its pharmacological activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 鉴于此， 本发明提供一种新型的稳定的蓬莪术环二烯晶型 A和蓬莪术环二烯晶型 A 的制备方法及应用。 发明内容 \n In view of the above, the present invention provides a novel method and application for the preparation of a stable ring-shaped ring diene crystal form A and a ring-shaped ring-shaped die-shaped form A.

Methods for analyzing protein-protein interactions include (1) yeast two-hybrid method, (2) method of mediating reporter protein cleavage along with protein reconstitution, (3) method using protein splicing, (4) Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and (5) PCA method (protein fragment complementation assay) are known. Hereinafter, these analysis methods will be described.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n（１）酵母ツーハイブリッド法\n\n　酵母Ｇａｌ４は、Ｎ末端側のＤＮＡ結合ドメイン（ＤＢＤ）とＣ末端側の転写活性化ドメイン（ＡＤ）からなる転写制御因子である。両ドメインは自律的に機能し、ＤＢＤは単独でＤＮＡに結合できるが転写の活性化は起こせず、ＡＤはＤＮＡに結合できないが、転写を活性化できる。この性質を応用して開発されたのが酵母ツーハイブリッド法である。即ち、Ｇａｌ４のＤＢＤに目的の蛋白質を融合した蛋白質（ベイト）と、Ｇａｌ４のＡＤに別の蛋白質を融合した蛋白質（プレイ）を酵母細胞に導入した場合、ベイトとプレイとが核内で相互作用すれば、酵母細胞内で転写制御複合体が再構成され、Ｇａｌ４結合部位依存的に転写が活性化されることになる。この活性をレポーター遺伝子を用いて検出することにより、ベイト及びプレイの間の相互作用を容易に評価できる。しかし、酵母ツーハイブリッド法は、核内での人工的な蛋白質会合を反映したものであり、現実の生命現象とは異なる場合もあることや、擬陽性が多い、リアルタイム計測が困難、細胞内でしか測定できないという欠点がある。\n\n(1) Yeast two-hybrid method Yeast Gal4 is a transcriptional regulatory factor comprising an N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD) and a C-terminal transcription activation domain (AD). Both domains function autonomously, DBD can bind to DNA alone but transcription does not occur, and AD cannot bind to DNA, but can activate transcription. The yeast two-hybrid method was developed by applying this property. That is, when a protein (bait) in which the target protein is fused to the Gal4 DBD and a protein (prey) in which another protein is fused to the Gal4 AD are introduced into yeast cells, the bait and prey interact in the nucleus. Then, the transcription control complex is reconstituted in the yeast cell, and transcription is activated depending on the Gal4 binding site. By detecting this activity using a reporter gene, the interaction between bait and prey can be easily evaluated. However, the yeast two-hybrid method reflects artificial protein association in the nucleus, and may differ from actual life phenomena, and there are many false positives, real-time measurement is difficult, and only in cells. There is a disadvantage that it cannot be measured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n（２）蛋白質の再構成と共にレポーター蛋白質の切断を介在させる方法\n\n　ユビキチンは76アミノ酸からなる小さな蛋白で、プロテアソームを介する不要蛋白質の分解に関係する。真核細胞では、ユビキチンが蛋白質に結合すると、ユビキチン結合蛋白質（UBP）により、迅速にユビキチン－蛋白質結合部位で切断される活性があるが、この際、ユビキチンが正確にフォールディングされている必要がある。そこで、ユビキチンをN末端（Nub）とC末端（Cub）に分割し、NubのC末端とNub のN末端にそれぞれ対象とする蛋白をリンカー介して結合し、さらにCubのC末端にはDHFRなどのレポーター蛋白を結合する。もし、対象の蛋白質間で相互作用がおこると、互いに接近するユビキチンが正しい折り畳みを起こし、UBPにより結合しているレポーター蛋白質が切断され、この切断を電気泳動などで確認することができる。ただし、切断前後でレポーター蛋白質の機能が変化するわけではないので、切断は電気泳動などでアッセイする必要があり、煩雑さが伴う。\n\n(2) Method of mediating reporter protein cleavage along with protein reconstitution Ubiquitin is a small protein consisting of 76 amino acids and is involved in the degradation of unwanted proteins via the proteasome. In eukaryotic cells, when ubiquitin binds to a protein, it is rapidly cleaved at the ubiquitin-protein binding site by the ubiquitin-binding protein (UBP). At this time, ubiquitin must be correctly folded. . Therefore, ubiquitin is divided into N-terminal (Nub) and C-terminal (Cub), and the target protein is linked to each of C-terminal of Nub and N-terminal of Nub via a linker. Binds the reporter protein. If an interaction occurs between the proteins of interest, the ubiquitins that approach each other cause correct folding, and the reporter protein bound by UBP is cleaved, and this cleavage can be confirmed by electrophoresis or the like. However, since the function of the reporter protein does not change before and after the cleavage, the cleavage needs to be assayed by electrophoresis or the like, which is complicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n（３）プロテインスプライシングを利用した手法\n\n　これは、酵母の発生期の翻訳産物から内部の蛋白質（Intein）が正確に切り出され、その両側（外側の）2つの蛋白質断片（Extein）がライゲーションされる現象を利用した方法である。すなわち、このInteinを2つに分割し、それぞれにExteinを結合し、他方の末端にプレイとベイトを結合すると、それらが相互作用した場合、2つのIntein由来の断片が接近し、元の形にフォールディングされることにより、スプライシング活性が回復し、Exteinがライゲートされ切り出される。この Exteinにレポーター蛋白質の断片を用いると、これによりレポーター蛋白質が再構成され、その回復した酵素活性などの機能により蛋白質間相互作用が評価できる。ただし、実際に酵素活性が観察される時間が長く、またバックグラウンドが高いといった問題がある。\n\n(3) A method using protein splicing This is a phenomenon in which the internal protein (Intein) is accurately cut out from the translation product in the nascent stage of yeast and the two protein fragments (Extein) on both sides (outer) are ligated. It is a method using. In other words, when this Intein is divided into two parts, Extein is bound to each, and Prey and Bait are bound to the other end, when they interact, the two Intein-derived fragments approach and return to their original form By being folded, the splicing activity is restored, and Extein is ligated and cut out. When a reporter protein fragment is used for this extein, the reporter protein is thereby reconstituted, and the interaction between the proteins can be evaluated by the function such as the recovered enzyme activity. However, there are problems that the enzyme activity is actually observed for a long time and the background is high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n（４）蛍光共鳴エネルギー移動（ＦＲＥＴ）\n\n　FRETは、蛍光分子から他の分子へ励起エネルギーが移動する現象であり、これを利用した分子センサーは広く利用されている。エネルギーを与える分子はドナー(供与体)、受け取る分子はアクセプタ(受容体)と呼ばれる。FRETが起こるためには、ドナーの蛍光スペクトルとアクセプタの吸収スペクトルに重なりがあることと、ドナーとアクセプタが接近して存在することが必要となる。FRETが起きた時、ドナーの蛍光は弱まり、アクセプタが蛍光分子であればその蛍光が観察される。そこでドナーを励起した時のドナーの蛍光強度とアクセプタの蛍光強度をモニターすることでFRETの測定が行える。FRETの測定としては、GFP(Green fluorescent protein)などの蛍光蛋白質を利用したFRET測定が広く行われている。蛍光蛋白質は特定の蛋白質と融合させて細胞に発現させることができるため、細胞内で起こる蛋白質間の相互作用を検出する有効な手段となっている。FRETは分子間の距離を測るだけでなく、分子の濃度や活性化状態を知るインジケータとしても使われている。FRETのイメージングは生きている細胞内で起こるさまざまな分子レベルの事象をリアルタイムで可視化することを可能にしている。しかし、ドナーとアクセプタの存在比が適切でなければならず、また蛍光分子も消光するために、測定可能な条件や時間が限られるといった問題がある。また、酵素などによるシグナル増幅効果がないために感度が悪い。\n\n(4) Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) \n FRET is a phenomenon in which excitation energy is transferred from a fluorescent molecule to another molecule, and molecular sensors using this are widely used. A molecule that gives energy is called a donor, and a molecule that receives energy is called an acceptor. In order for FRET to occur, it is necessary that there is an overlap between the fluorescence spectrum of the donor and the absorption spectrum of the acceptor, and that the donor and acceptor are close to each other. When FRET occurs, the donor fluorescence is weakened, and if the acceptor is a fluorescent molecule, the fluorescence is observed. Therefore, FRET can be measured by monitoring the fluorescence intensity of the donor and the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor when the donor is excited. As the measurement of FRET, FRET measurement using a fluorescent protein such as GFP (Green fluorescent protein) is widely performed. Since fluorescent proteins can be expressed in cells by being fused with specific proteins, they are an effective means for detecting interactions between proteins that occur in cells. In addition to measuring the distance between molecules, FRET is also used as an indicator to know the concentration and activation state of molecules. FRET imaging makes it possible to visualize various molecular-level events that occur in living cells in real time. However, the abundance ratio of the donor and acceptor must be appropriate, and the fluorescent molecules are also quenched, so that there are problems that the conditions and time that can be measured are limited. Moreover, since there is no signal amplification effect by enzymes etc., sensitivity is bad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n（５）ＰＣＡ法（プロテイン・フラグメント・コンプリメンテーション・アッセイ）\n\n　ＰＣＡ法では、一つの機能蛋白質Ａ（酵素、転写因子など）を二つの断片Ａ１及びＡ２に分割し、それぞれをベイト及びプレイと融合し、融合蛋白質Ａ１－Ｐ及びＡ２－Ｑを作製する。ベイト及びプレイが結合すると、機能蛋白質Ａの機能が回復し、その活性を検出することで、ベイト及びプレイの相互作用を判定することができる。機能蛋白質としては、例えばβ－ラクタマーゼ、DHFRやβ－ガラクトシダーゼ（β-Gal）、ＧＦＰ、ルシフェラーゼを利用することができる。\n\n(5) PCA method (protein fragment complementation assay) \n In the PCA method, one functional protein A (enzyme, transcription factor, etc.) is divided into two fragments A1 and A2, and each is fused with bait and prey to produce fusion proteins A1-P and A2-Q. When the bait and prey are combined, the function of the functional protein A is restored, and the interaction between the bait and prey can be determined by detecting the activity. As the functional protein, for example, β-lactamase, DHFR, β-galactosidase (β-Gal), GFP, or luciferase can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　ルシフェラーゼを用いる手法は、酵素の発光効率が高いことを特徴とし、もっとも高い感度を実現できる。これまでにFirefly、Renilla、Gaussia由来のルシフェラーゼを用いたＰＣＡが報告されている。Firefly（ホタル）ルシフェラーゼは、２つのドメイン構造から成り立っており、ドメイン間には大きな溝が存在し、活性部位を形成している。ＰＣＡには、ドメイン境界付近の、４２０、４３７、４４５、４５５番目の間で切断した断片を用いることができる（Paulmurugan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99, 15608-15613, (2002)、Paulmurugan et al., Anal. Chem. 77, 1295-1302(2005)）。Renilla（ウミシイタケ）ルシフェラーゼでは、９１、２２９番目で切断した断片を用いたＰＣＡが報告されている（Paulmurugan et al., Anal. Chem. 75, 1584-1589 (2003)、Kaihara et al., Anal. Chem. 75, 4176-4181 (2003)）。Gaussia（海洋性カイアシ類）ルシフェラーゼでは、９３、９４番目で断片が用いられた。（Remy et al., Nat. Methods 3, 977-979 (2006)）\n\n\nThe method using luciferase is characterized by high luminous efficiency of the enzyme and can achieve the highest sensitivity. So far, PCA using luciferase derived from Firefly, Renilla and Gaussia has been reported. Firefly luciferase is composed of two domain structures, and there is a large groove between the domains to form an active site. For PCA, fragments cleaved between positions 420, 437, 445, and 455 near the domain boundary can be used (Paulmurugan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99, 15608-15613, ( 2002), Paulmurugan et al., Anal. Chem. 77, 1295-1302 (2005)). In Renilla luciferase, PCA using fragments cleaved at \npositions\n 91 and 229 has been reported (Paulmurugan et al., Anal. Chem. 75, 1584-1589 (2003), Kaihara et al., Anal. Chem. 75, 4176-4181 (2003)). In Gaussia (marine copepod) luciferase, fragments were used at positions 93 and 94. (Remy et al., Nat. \nMethods\n 3, 977-979 (2006))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　ルシフェラーゼによるＰＣＡでは、高いバックグランドシグナルや、酵素活性の回復率が低いことが問題となっている。また、蛋白質の安定性等の問題により、ルシフェラーゼの細胞外ＰＣＡは主に細胞内での実施であり、細胞外としては、細胞ライセートを用いた例があるのみで（I. Remy and SW Michnick, Nat. Methods, 3, 977-979 (2006)、Paulmurugan et al., Cancer Res. 15, 7413-7420 (2005)）、精製蛋白質では例がない。また、他の酵素断片を用いたＰＣＡでも、試験管内で分子間相互作用を酵素活性として検出可能な系は極めて少ない。\n\n\nIn PCA using luciferase, there are problems of high background signal and low recovery rate of enzyme activity. In addition, due to problems such as protein stability, extracellular PCA of luciferase is mainly carried out intracellularly, and there are only examples using extracellular cell lysates (I. Remy and SW Michnick, Nat. Methods, 3, 977-979 (2006), Paulmurugan et al., Cancer Res. 15, 7413-7420 (2005)), purified protein has no examples. Even with PCA using other enzyme fragments, there are very few systems capable of detecting intermolecular interactions as enzyme activities in a test tube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　本発明は、上記した従来技術の問題点を解消することを解決すべき課題とした。すなわち、本発明は、蛋白質の安定性、再構成効率、及び比活性に優れ、微量の分子であっても迅速に分子間の相互作用又は接近を検出できる方法を提供することを解決すべき課題とした。\n\n\nThe present invention has made it a problem to be solved to solve the above-mentioned problems of the prior art. That is, the present invention is an object to be solved by providing a method that is excellent in protein stability, reconstitution efficiency, and specific activity, and that can quickly detect interaction or approach between molecules even with a very small amount of molecules. It was.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　本発明者らは上記課題を解決するために鋭意検討した結果、２段階の酵素反応機構を有するレポーター酵素の変異体であって１段階目の反応が律速過程となる変異体を分析対象の２種類の分子の一方に連結した第一の分子と、２段階の酵素反応機構を有するレポーター酵素の変異体であって２段階目の反応が律速過程となる変異体を上記の分析対象の２種類の分子の他方に連結した第二の分子とを接触させ、上記レポーター酵素が触媒する酵素反応の進行の有無を検出することによって、分子間の相互作用又は接近を検出できることを見出し、本発明を完成するに至った。\n\n\nAs a result of intensive studies to solve the above-mentioned problems, the present inventors have analyzed a mutant of a reporter enzyme having a two-stage enzyme reaction mechanism in which the first-stage reaction is a rate-determining process. The first molecule linked to one of the two types of molecules and a variant of a reporter enzyme having a two-step enzyme reaction mechanism in which the second-step reaction is the rate-limiting process It was found that the interaction or approach between the molecules can be detected by contacting a second molecule linked to the other of the molecules and detecting the progress of the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by the reporter enzyme.

A linked first molecule and a second variant of a reporter enzyme having a two-stage enzyme reaction mechanism in which the second-stage reaction is the rate-determining process.

And a second variant of a reporter enzyme variant having a two-stage enzyme reaction mechanism in which the second-stage reaction is a rate-limiting process linked to the other of the two molecules to be analyzed. A reagent kit for detecting an interaction or access between molecules is provided by the method according to any one of \nclaims\n 1 to 5, comprising a combination with molecules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　本発明によれば、数個のアミノ酸変異を有する全長のルシフェラーゼを用いるために、安定性や活性は飛躍的に改善され、これまで実用が困難であった試験管内でのルシフェラーゼ発光を用いた蛋白質間の相互作用の測定が可能となる。本発明によれば、DNA結合蛋白質同士の相互作用のほか、同程度のサイズの二つの蛋白質同士、すなわち抗体可変領域VH/VL、２個の一本鎖抗体、抗原と一本鎖抗体、リガンドと受容体など広範な相互作用の検出が可能である。\n\n\nAccording to the present invention, since a full-length luciferase having several amino acid mutations is used, the stability and activity are drastically improved, and a protein using luciferase luminescence in a test tube that has been difficult to put into practice so far. It is possible to measure the interaction between the two. According to the present invention, in addition to the interaction between DNA-binding proteins, two proteins of the same size, ie, antibody variable region VH / VL, two single-chain antibodies, antigen and single-chain antibody, ligand It is possible to detect a wide range of interactions such as the receptor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　また、本発明の方法は発光を用いた検出法であるため、数nM程度の試料100μl(pmol以下）と通常の基質ルシフェリンおよびATPおよび発光検出器があれば検出を行うことができ、簡易検出系への応用が容易である。また検出時間は１サンプルあたり数秒ですむ。また、サンプルの固定化及び洗浄を省略することも可能であり、更に短時間での測定が可能となる。試験管内で検出可能な均一系蛋白質間相互作用検出系としてはβガラクトシダーゼ変異体Δα／Δω相補性に基づく検出系や、蛍光標識蛋白間のエネルギー移動(FRET)を利用した方法が知られているが、それらと比較しても検出時間とS/B比において、本発明の方が優れている(Ueda et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 279, 209-218, 2003)。また、二種類の全長酵素を用いる蛋白質間相互作用検出系として知られているEnzyme Channeling Assayと比較した場合、Enzyme Channeling Assayでは測定に時間がかかるなどの問題が知られているが、本発明では数秒という短時間での検出が可能である。\n\n\nIn addition, since the method of the present invention is a detection method using luminescence, detection is possible with a sample of about several nM (100 μl or less) and normal substrate luciferin, ATP, and a luminescence detector. Application to the system is easy. The detection time is only a few seconds per sample. Further, it is possible to omit immobilization and washing of the sample, and measurement in a shorter time becomes possible. Known detection systems based on β-galactosidase mutant Δα / Δω complementarity and methods using energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescently labeled proteins are known as detection systems for homogeneous protein-protein interactions that can be detected in vitro. However, even in comparison with them, the present invention is superior in detection time and S / B ratio (Ueda et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 279, 209-218, 2003). Further, when compared with Enzyme Channeling Assay, which is known as a protein-protein interaction detection system using two types of full-length enzymes, Enzyme Channeling Assay has problems such as taking time, but in the present invention Detection in a short time of several seconds is possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　さらに本発明の検出系は、原理的にありとあらゆる分子間相互作用検出に適用可能であり、特に診断マーカーや農薬、環境汚染物質などの簡易検出キットに応用できる。特に、サンドイッチELISA法の代替とすることも可能である。また、本発明で用いる検出系プローブ（レポーター酵素の変異体）は蛋白質であるため、GFP変異体を用いたプローブと同様これを細胞に発現させることで、高感度な細胞レベルや生体レベルの相互作用検出に基づく画像診断が可能である。\n\n\nFurthermore, the detection system of the present invention is applicable in principle to any kind of intermolecular interaction detection, and in particular, it can be applied to simple detection kits such as diagnostic markers, agricultural chemicals and environmental pollutants. In particular, the sandwich ELISA method can be substituted. In addition, since the detection system probe (reporter enzyme mutant) used in the present invention is a protein, it can be expressed in cells in the same manner as a probe using a GFP mutant. Image diagnosis based on action detection is possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n図１は、ホタルおよびヒカリコメツキルシフェラーゼの行う二段階の触媒反応（即ち、ルシフェリンLH\n2\nのアデニル化反応(LH\n2\n-AMP生成反応)、および中間体LH\n2\n-AMPの酸化的発光反応）を示す。\nFIG. 1 shows a two-step catalytic reaction (ie, luciferin LH \n2\n adenylation reaction (LH \n2\n -AMP formation reaction) and oxidative luminescence reaction of intermediate LH \n2\n -AMP) performed by firefly and light click luciferase. .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n図２は、実施例の概要を示す。特定の二本鎖DNA配列を認識可能な亜鉛フィンガー蛋白質Zif12とルシフェラーゼ変異体の融合蛋白質を作製し、２つのZif12の認識配列が近接している場合は、2つの融合蛋白質が2本鎖DNA上で空間的に接近するため、変異体１から放出された中間体LH\n2\n-AMPが効率的に、変異体２へと受け渡され発光反応速度が増大する。\nFIG. 2 shows an overview of the embodiment. When a fusion protein of zinc finger protein Zif12 and luciferase mutant capable of recognizing a specific double-stranded DNA sequence is prepared, and the two recognition sequences of Zif12 are close to each other, the two fusion proteins are present on the double-stranded DNA.

The Protein Fragment complementation (PCA) method that can be detected by the method is known. However, PCA with N / C domain in vitro has hardly been reported so far because the fusion protein of fragmented luciferase is unstable and the reconstitution efficiency is low. On the other hand, the luciferase catalyzed reaction proceeds in two steps: luciferin LH \n2\n adenylation reaction (LH \n2\n -AMP formation reaction) and intermediate LH \n2\n -AMP oxidative luminescence reaction (FIG. 1). ing. So far, the intermediate LH \n2\n -AMP can be generated, but the second stage reaction is extremely slow, so the 245th histidine of firefly luciferase is used as a mutant that releases a large amount of LH \n2\n -AMP out of the enzyme. A mutant (H245D) substituted with aspartic acid has been reported (Branchini et al., Biochemistry, 37, 15311-15319, 1998, Ayabe et al., FEBS Lett. 579, 4389-4394, 2005). As another firefly luciferase variant, K529A, in which 529th lysine is substituted with alanine, hardly undergoes the first stage adenylation reaction, but the second stage LH \n2\n -AMP oxidative luminescence reaction. It is known that it can be performed efficiently (Branchini et al., Biochemistry, 44, 1385-1393, 2005). Similarly to H245D, the second stage oxidative luminescence reaction is rate-limiting (Branchini et al., Biochemistry, 44, 1385-1393, 2005), while the crystal structure with the reaction intermediate analog (Nakatsu et al. , Nature 440, 372-376, 2006) have reported a mutant (K443A) in which the 443rd lysine is substituted with alanine, whose results have been questioned. Therefore, in the present invention, an intermolecular two-step reaction in which an intermediate produced from one mutant is consumed by the other mutant and emits light from various combinations of these mutants is efficiently performed. Tried to find a combination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　具体的には、本明細書の実施例においては、上記の変異体と二本鎖DNA配列を特異的に認識可能なZif12を用いて特異的DNA配列検出へ応用した。具体的には野生型、及び作用点のはっきりしないK443Aを含む、各変異体Fluc、N-domain (1-437 aa)、C-domain (394-550 aa)とZif12の融合蛋白質発現ベクターを作製し、大腸菌BL21(DE3, pLysS)で発現させ、融合蛋白質Ｃ末に付加したHisタグを利用した金属アフィニティ精製を行った。その後ELISAによるZinc fingerの結合能の確認、および各変異体の比活性が文献通り野生型の１％以下である事の確認を行った。ついで作製した変異体単独、およびその全ての組み合わせのペアで固定化DNAを用いた活性測定を行ったところ、Zif12が特異的に２個結合する配列であるIRを固定化した場合に殆どの組み合わせで二つの変異体の平均の活性が検出され、Zif12が１個のみ弱く結合する配列であるSSを固定化した場合には活性が検出されなかった。しかしすでに報告されているNドメインとCドメインおよびH245DとCドメインの融合蛋白質ペアについて、若干ではあるが平均値以上の活性が検出された。そこで、Cドメイン融合蛋白質に比べ高い発光活性を示すH245Dに更に変異を導入した二重変異体K529A/H245D(5H)およびK443A/H245D(4H)を作製し、バックグラウンド活性を下げることでより高い応答を示すペアが得られることをもくろみスクリーニングを行った。その結果、5Hあるいは4H、およびK529AあるいはK443Aの４つの変異体間ペアが有意に平均以上の発光活性を示すことが判明した。また、発光測定時間を３分から1秒に短くすることで、更に高い活性上昇率を得ることができた。これらの変異体ペアを溶液中で単に混合して反応させた場合にはこのような活性上昇は殆ど見られなかったことから、活性上昇はDNAとZif12を介して二つの変異体同士が近接したことを反映していると考えられた。すなわち、マイクロプレートに固定化した状態ではあるがDNAを介して二つのタンパク質を相互作用させたときに期待値の７倍程度の活性上昇が得られる相互作用検出系が取得できた。また得られた信号強度は従来のN/C相補系の約1000倍かつ野生型の１％以上の強いものであった。また活性上昇の見られた変異体の組み合わせとその反応の早さから、この活性上昇は分子シャペロンのない細胞外では起こりにくいドメイン再構成によるものでなく、H245D変異を持つ変異体が生成した中間体をもう片方の変異体が消費した結果と思われた。すなわち、酸化的発光反応が律速であるH245D変異を持つ変異体が放出する微量の中間体を、アデニル化反応が律速であるK529AないしK443Aが消費することで、発光強度が顕著に増大したと思われた。また、この際H245Dに二重変異を導入することで中間体の生成量が減少することで、中性pHで加水分解しやすい中間体が二重変異体近傍に局在し、近傍にある変異体酵素のみが活性化される条件が実現できたものと推測された。\n\n\nSpecifically, in the examples of the present specification, Zif12 capable of specifically recognizing the mutant and the double-stranded DNA sequence was applied to specific DNA sequence detection. Specifically, expression of fusion protein expression vector of each mutant Fluc, N-domain (1-437 aa), C-domain (394-550 aa) and Zif12, including wild-type and K443A whose action point is not clear Then, it was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3, pLysS), and metal affinity purification using a His tag added to the fusion protein C-terminal was performed. Thereafter, the binding ability of Zinc finger was confirmed by ELISA, and the specific activity of each mutant was confirmed to be 1% or less of the wild type as described in the literature. Subsequently, when the activity was measured using the immobilized DNA with the mutants alone and all combinations of the mutants, most combinations were obtained when IR, which is a sequence that specifically binds two Zif12s, was immobilized. The average activity of the two mutants was detected, and no activity was detected when SS, which is a sequence to which only one Zif12 binds weakly, was immobilized. However, in the previously reported N-domain and C-domain and H245D-C domain fusion protein pairs, a slight but above average activity was detected. Therefore, double mutants K529A / H245D (5H) and K443A / H245D (4H), in which mutations were further introduced into H245D, which exhibits higher luminescence activity than C domain fusion proteins, were prepared and lowered by reducing background activity. Screening was performed in consideration of obtaining a pair showing a response. As a result, it was found that 5H or 4H and four mutant pairs of K529A or K443A showed significantly higher than average luminescence activity. Moreover, by increasing the luminescence measurement time from 3 minutes to 1 second, it was possible to obtain a higher activity increase rate. When these mutant pairs were simply mixed and reacted in a solution, such an increase in activity was hardly observed, so the increase in activity was caused by the proximity of the two mutants via DNA and Zif12. It was thought to reflect that. That is, an interaction detection system was obtained in which the activity was increased by about 7 times the expected value when two proteins interacted with each other through DNA although they were immobilized on a microplate. The obtained signal intensity was about 1000 times that of the conventional N / C complementary system and 1% or more stronger than the wild type. In addition, due to the combination of mutants with increased activity and the rapid response, this increased activity is not due to domain reorganization that is unlikely to occur outside the cell without a molecular chaperone. The body was probably consumed by the other mutant. In other words, the luminescence intensity was significantly increased by the consumption of a small amount of intermediate released by the mutant having the H245D mutation whose rate of oxidative luminescence reaction is limited by K529A to K443A whose rate of adenylation reaction is limited. It was broken. In addition, by introducing double mutations in H245D at this time, the amount of intermediates produced is reduced, so that intermediates that are easily hydrolyzed at neutral pH are localized in the vicinity of the double mutants, and nearby mutations. It was speculated that the condition that only the body enzyme was activated could be realized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　本発明による分子間の相互作用又は接近を検出する方法は、２段階の酵素反応機構を有するレポーター酵素の変異体であって１段階目の反応が律速過程となる第一の変異体を分析対象の２種類の分子の一方に連結した第一の分子と、２段階の酵素反応機構を有するレポーター酵素の変異体であって２段階目の反応が律速過程となる第二の変異体を上記の分析対象の２種類の分子の他方に連結した第二の分子とを接触させ、上記レポーター酵素が触媒する酵素反応の進行の有無を検出することを特徴とする。\n\n\nThe method for detecting the interaction or approach between molecules according to the present invention is a variant of a reporter enzyme having a two-stage enzyme reaction mechanism, in which the first mutant whose rate-limiting process is the first-stage reaction is analyzed. A first molecule linked to one of the two types of molecules and a second variant of a reporter enzyme having a two-stage enzyme reaction mechanism, wherein the second-stage reaction is the rate-limiting process. A second molecule linked to the other of the two types of molecules to be analyzed is brought into contact with each other, and the presence or absence of the progress of an enzyme reaction catalyzed by the reporter enzyme is detected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　２段階の酵素反応機構を有するレポーター酵素の種類は特に限定されないが、好ましくはホタルルシフェラーゼ、ヒカリコメツキルシフェラーゼ、アセチルＣｏＡ合成酵素、グラミシジン合成酵素等のアシルアデニル酸／チオエステル形成酵素スーパーファミリーに属する酵素を挙げることができる。なお、本発明においては生じる反応中間体が共通であれば、検出に用いる二種類の変異体が異なる酵素由来でも構わない。\n\n\nThe type of reporter enzyme having a two-step enzyme reaction mechanism is not particularly limited, but preferably an enzyme belonging to the acyl adenylate / thioester-forming enzyme superfamily such as firefly luciferase, light-worm luciferase, acetyl CoA synthase, and gramicidin synthase. Can be mentioned. In the present invention, as long as the generated reaction intermediate is common, the two types of mutants used for detection may be derived from different enzymes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　発光（ルミネッセンス）とは励起されたエミッター分子が引き起こす可視スペクトル範囲内の光子放射に与えられる用語である。蛍光とは対照的に、発光のエネルギーは短波長照射の形で外部から供給されるものではない。化学発光と生物発光とは明確に区別されている。化学発光は、励起分子を与える化学反応に与えられた用語であって、その励起分子自体では、励起水準にある電子が正常エネルギー水準に戻る時に光を放射する。生物発光は、この反応が酵素で触媒される時に使用される用語である。この反応に関与する酵素は、一般にルシフェラーゼと呼ばれる。\n\n\nLuminescence is the term given to photon emission within the visible spectral range caused by excited emitter molecules. In contrast to fluorescence, the energy of light emission is not supplied externally in the form of short wavelength irradiation. There is a clear distinction between chemiluminescence and bioluminescence. Chemiluminescence is a term given to a chemical reaction that gives an excited molecule, and the excited molecule itself emits light when an electron at an excited level returns to a normal energy level. Bioluminescence is the term used when this reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme. The enzyme involved in this reaction is generally called luciferase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　ルシフェラーゼは、その起源またはその基質特異性（もしくは反応機構）に基づいても相互に区別できる。最重要な基質には、セレンテラジンおよびルシフェリン、およびこれら二化合物の誘導体が含まれる。\n\n\nLuciferases can also be distinguished from each other based on their origin or their substrate specificity (or reaction mechanism).

First, the carboxyl group of luciferin (LH2) attacks the phosphate group at the α-position of ATP, and once the LH2-AMP intermediate is generated in the enzyme, pyrophosphate (PPi) is released. Then, the enzyme reacts with this intermediate, AMP, together with the CO \n2,\n to produce oxyluciferin excited state, which is moved to the ground state. At this time, the difference energy is emitted as yellowish green visible light (560 nm). The quantum efficiency of this energy conversion is extremely high, reaching almost 90%. Firefly luciferase has been used to examine the activation of in vitro cultured animals, bacteria, insects, plants, yeast and viral cells. The firefly luciferase assay is extremely sensitive, rapid, convenient and safe (Non-radioisotopic) compared to other reporter gene assays. The luciferase assay is 100-1000 times more sensitive and has a wider measurable range than the CAT assay using radioisotopes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　他のルシフェラーゼとして、Renilla（ウミシイタケ）やGaussia（海洋性カイアシ類）ルシフェラーゼを挙げることができる。Renilla（ウミシイタケ）ルシフェラーゼは、ＡＴＰ非要求性であり、基質であるセレンテラジンを用いて発光反応を触媒する（下図）。Gaussia（海洋性カイアシ類）ルシフェラーゼもまた、ATPを必要とせず、セレンテラジン酸化の触媒によって発光（470nm）する。GaussiaルシフェラーゼはFirefly、Renillaルシフェラーゼの1000倍以上のシグナル強度を持ち、安定性が非常に高いという特徴を有している。\n\n\nOther luciferases include Renilla (Renilla) and Gaussia (marine copepod) luciferases. Renilla (Renilla) luciferase is non-ATP-requiring and catalyzes a luminescence reaction using coelenterazine as a substrate (lower figure). Gaussia (marine copepod) luciferase also does not require ATP and emits light (470 nm) by a catalyst for coelenterazine oxidation. Gaussia luciferase has a signal strength that is 1000 times higher than that of Firefly and Renilla luciferase, and is characterized by extremely high stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　これまでにホタルルシフェラーゼ活性に関わるアミノ酸残基に関する研究が行われており、２４５番目のヒスチジン (Branchini et al., Biochemistry, 37, 15311-15319, 1998、Ayabe et al., FEBS Lett. 579, 4389-4394, 2005)、５２９番目のリジン（Branchini et al., Biochemistry, 39, 5433-5440, 2000））及び４４３番目のリジンの重要性が明らかとなっている。２４５番目のヒスチジンをアスパラギン酸に変換したH245D変異体では、反応中間体であるLH2-AMPを大量に生成・放出することが見出されており、二段階の反応（ルシフェリンLH2のアデニル化反応、および反応中間体LH2-AMPを用いた酸化的発光反応）のうち、第二段階目の酸化的発光反応が律速となっていた。よって、２４５番目のヒスチジンは、酸化的発光反応で重要な役割を果たしているといえる (Ayabe et al., FEBS Lett. 579, 4389-4394, 2005)。また、５２９番目のリジンをアラニンに変換したK529A変異体では、アデニル化反応速度が大きく低下していたが、反応中間体LH2-AMPを添加することで、すみやかに酸化的発光反応を起こすことから、５２９番目のリジンはアデニル化反応において特に重要な役割を担っていることが明らかとなった。同様に、４４３番目のリジンをアラニンに変換したK443A変異体においては、アデニル化反応速度にはほとんど影響がなく、酸化的発光反応速度が低下しており、酸化的発光反応での重要性が示唆されている（Branchini et al., Biochemistry, 44, 1385-1393, 2005）。しかし最近の構造解析の結果(Nakatsu et al., Nature 440, 372-376, 2006)から、この結果の評価はまだ定まっておらず、K443が発光反応にいかに関与しているかは検討の余地がある。これらの実験結果から上記の通り、本発明で用いるレポーター酵素の変異体としては、H245D およびK529A、（及び／又はK443A）の何れかのアミノ酸置換を有するホタルルシフェラーゼ変異体が好ましい。また、K529およびK443については、他のアミノ酸置換体も同様に好ましいと考えられる。\n\n\nStudies on amino acid residues involved in firefly luciferase activity have been conducted so far, and the 245th histidine (Branchini et al., Biochemistry, 37, 15311-15319, 1998, Ayabe et al., EttFEBS Lett. 579, 4389 -4394, 2005), the importance of the 529th lysine (Branchini.et al., Biochemistry, 39, 5433-5440, 2000)) and the 443rd lysine has been revealed. The H245D mutant, in which the 245th histidine is converted to aspartic acid, has been found to produce and release a large amount of the reaction intermediate LH2-AMP, a two-step reaction (the luciferin LH2 adenylation reaction, And oxidative luminescence reaction using the reaction intermediate LH2-AMP), the second stage oxidative luminescence reaction was rate-limiting. Therefore, it can be said that the 245th histidine plays an important role in the oxidative luminescence reaction (Ayabe et al., FEBS Lett. 579, 4389-4394, 2005). In addition, in the K529A mutant in which the 529th lysine was converted to alanine, the adenylation reaction rate was greatly reduced. However, the addition of the reaction intermediate LH2-AMP promptly causes an oxidative luminescence reaction. It became clear that the 529th lysine plays a particularly important role in the adenylation reaction. Similarly, the K443A mutant in which the 443rd lysine was converted to alanine had little effect on the adenylation reaction rate, and the oxidative luminescence reaction rate decreased, suggesting its importance in the oxidative luminescence reaction. (Branchini et al., Biochemistry, 44, 1385-1393, 2005). However, based on the results of recent structural analysis (Nakatsu et al., Nature 440, 372-376, 2006), the evaluation of this result has not yet been determined, and there is room for examination of how K443 is involved in the luminescence reaction. is there. From these experimental results, as described above, the mutant of the reporter enzyme used in the present invention is preferably a firefly luciferase mutant having any amino acid substitution of H245D245 and K529A (and / or K443A).

First, a mutant of a reporter enzyme having a two-stage enzyme reaction mechanism in which the DNA encoding the mutant is linked in an appropriate expression vector, and the first-stage reaction is the rate-limiting process. A first recombinant expression vector capable of expressing a first molecule in which the mutant is linked to one of two types of molecules to be analyzed can be constructed. Similarly, a reporter enzyme having a two-stage enzyme reaction mechanism by incorporating a DNA encoding the second protein and a DNA encoding the second variant of the reporter enzyme in a state of being linked in an appropriate expression vector.

And the second molecule can be expressed and the first and second molecules can be individually recovered from the culture. By using the first molecule and the second molecule collected in this manner and bringing them into contact with each other in vitro, for example, it is possible to detect the progress of the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by the reporter enzyme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　あるいは、上記した第一の組み換え発現ベクターと、第二の組み換え発現ベクターとを適当な同一の宿主に形質転換して、上記宿主を培養することによって、上記第一の分子及び第二の分子を発現させ、該宿主内でレポーター酵素が触媒する酵素反応の進行の有無を検出することもできる。\n\n\nAlternatively, by transforming the first recombinant expression vector and the second recombinant expression vector into a suitable same host and culturing the host, the first molecule and the second molecule are transformed.

Furthermore, in the present invention, the binding of the two kinds of molecules to be analyzed to the target molecule can be detected by making another target molecule to which the two kinds of molecules to be analyzed bind together coexist. That is, when the progress of the enzyme reaction catalyzed by the reporter enzyme is detected, it indicates that the two target molecules are bound to the target molecule, and the progress of the enzyme reaction catalyzed by the reporter enzyme is detected. If not, it indicates that the two molecules to be analyzed are not bound to the target molecule at the same time.

The resulting colonies were added to 4 ml of LBAC medium. Inoculated and cultured overnight at 37 ° C. Next, 400 μl of the culture solution was inoculated into 100 ml of LBAC liquid medium, and when OD \n600\n reached about 0.5 at 37 ° C., 1 mM IPTG was added to induce protein expression, and at 16 ° C. Cultured overnight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n（３）蛋白質精製\n\n　培養後、菌体を遠心分離操作によって回収し、10 mlのExtraction bufferに再懸濁し、氷上で超音波破砕した後、10000 x g、60 min、4℃で遠心分離し、上清（ライセート）を回収した。\n\n　今回発現させた蛋白質にはヒスチジンタグが融合されており、TALON affinity resin (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA)を用いて精製を行った。TALON affinity Resin 100 μlにライセート10 mlを添加し、室温で20 min穏やかに反転混合しながら蛋白質を結合させた。卓上遠心分離機によってresinを回収し、上清を廃棄した後、10 ml のExtraction bufferを加えて懸濁するという洗浄操作を3回繰り返した後、Elution Bufferを加えて蛋白質の溶出操作を数回行った。それぞれの溶出液はブラッドフォード法による蛋白濃度測定を行い、濃度が高いと思われるフラクションをNAP5カラム（GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Amersham Place, England）を用いて蛋白質保存用バッファーに置換し、分注して-80℃に保存した。\n\n(3) Protein purification After culturing, the cells are collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml extraction buffer, sonicated on ice, centrifuged at 10000 xg, 60 min, 4 ° C, The lysate was recovered. \n The protein expressed this time was fused with a histidine tag and purified using TALON affinity resin (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA). 10 ml of lysate was added to 100 μl of TALON affinity Resin, and proteins were allowed to bind while gently inversion for 20 min at room temperature. After collecting the resin with a tabletop centrifuge and discarding the supernatant, the washing operation of adding 10 ml of Extraction buffer and suspending was repeated three times, and then the Elution Buffer was added and the protein was eluted several times. went. Each eluate was measured for protein concentration by the Bradford method, and the fraction with high concentration was replaced with a protein storage buffer using a NAP5 column (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Amersham Place, England). And stored at -80 ° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　金属アフィニティ精製後サンプルのSDS-PAGEにより、野生型と他変異体 (M.W. 88.3 kDa)、Nドメイン (M.W. 76.7 kDa)、Cドメイン (M.W. 44.8 kDa)とZif12との融合蛋白質が設計したサイズの通り十分な純度で調製できたことを確認した。そこでブラッドフォード法による蛋白濃度測定（プロテインアッセイ，Bio-Rad）にて最終的に各蛋白質の定量を行った。\n\n\nAccording to SDS-PAGE of the sample after metal affinity purification, the fusion protein of wild type and other mutant (MW 88.3 kDa), N domain (MW 76.7 kDa), C domain (MW 44.8 kDa) and Zif12 was designed. It was confirmed that it could be prepared with sufficient purity. Therefore, the protein concentration was finally measured by Bradford method (protein assay, Bio-Rad).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n（４）比活性の評価\n\n　精製Zif12融合蛋白質を、終濃度10 nMになるように発光測定用バッファーで希釈し、Costar白色96穴プレート（CorningCostar Inc., Corning, NY）に50 μlずつ分注し、２x LH2溶液を50 μl添加し、1秒間の発光強度をAB-2350 ルミノメーターPHELIOS（Atto Co., 東京）を用いて測定した。それぞれの蛋白質終濃度10 nMで発光強度を測定した結果が図３である。これによりNドメイン、Cドメインおよび変異体の発光活性は、野生型の1 ％以下であることを確認し、バックグラウンドとして十分に低いことがわかった。\n\n(4) Evaluation of specific activity The purified Zif12 fusion protein was diluted with a buffer for luminescence measurement to a final concentration of 10 nM, and 50 μl was dispensed into a Costar white 96-well plate (CorningCostar Inc., Corning, NY). 50 μl of 2 × LH2 solution was added, and the luminescence intensity for 1 second was measured using AB-2350 luminometer PHELIOS (Atto Co., Tokyo). FIG. 3 shows the results of measuring the luminescence intensity at each protein final concentration of 10 nM. As a result, it was confirmed that the luminescence activity of the N domain, the C domain and the mutant was 1% or less of the wild type, and it was found that the background was sufficiently low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n（５）DNA結合活性測定\n\n　白色96穴プレートにPBS溶液で希釈したストレプトアビジン10 μg/ml を4°Cで一晩固定させた後、PBSBで2時間ブロッキングした後、PBSTで３回洗浄した。次いで10 nMのビオチン化ターゲットDNA（IR、SS）を含むPBSBを50 μlずつ分注し、1時間室温で静置した。PBSTで３回洗浄し、発光測定用バッファーで希釈した様々な濃度の精製Zif12融合野生型ルシフェラーゼを50 μlずつ分注し、1時間静置した。PBSTで３回洗浄し、発光測定用バッファーを50 μlずつ分注した後、2x LH2溶液を50 μl添加して発光強度を測定した。その結果、隣り合った２個のターゲット配列を持つIRを固定化した場合、加えた蛋白質濃度に比例して発光強度が増大したのに対し、ターゲット配列を１個のみ持つSSを固定化した場合シグナルも弱く有意な蛋白質濃度依存性が確認できなった。よって、融合蛋白質のIR特異的DNA結合能が確認できた。\n\n(5) Measurement of \nDNA binding activity\n 10 μg / ml of streptavidin diluted with a PBS solution was fixed to a white 96-well plate overnight at 4 ° C., blocked with PBSB for 2 hours, and then washed 3 times with PBST. Subsequently, 50 μl of PBSB containing 10 nM biotinylated target DNA (IR, SS) was dispensed and allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour. After washing with PBST three times, 50 μl of purified Zif12-fused wild-type luciferase with various concentrations diluted with a luminescence measurement buffer was dispensed and allowed to stand for 1 hour. After washing 3 times with PBST and dispensing 50 μl of the luminescence measurement buffer, 50 μl of 2 × LH2 solution was added and the luminescence intensity was measured. As a result, when the IR with two adjacent target sequences was immobilized, the luminescence intensity increased in proportion to the added protein concentration, whereas the SS with only one target sequence was immobilized. The signal was weak and significant protein concentration dependency could not be confirmed. Therefore, the IR-specific DNA binding ability of the fusion protein was confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n（６）2種の変異体混合による発光強度増強\n\n　白色96穴プレートにビオチン化IR DNAを上記のように固定し、発現精製して得られたZif12融合蛋白質のうち2つを選び、それぞれを単独で40 nM、あるいは終濃度20 nM（合計40 nM）になるように混合し分注し、上記のように洗浄後発光強度を測定した。発光測定は特に記さない場合基質添加後３秒後から1秒間行い、３サンプルの平均値を求めた。その結果、従来のPCA法であるNドメインとCドメインを組み合わせた場合、それぞれ単独の発光活性から予想される値（平均値）に対しわずか1.3倍の発光強度しか観測されなかった（図４、測定時間３分）。一方、残りの組み合わせのうち、K529A/H245D (5H)+ K529A、5H + K443A、K443A/H245D(4H) + K529A、および4H + K443Aにおいて混合した場合に期待値より顕著に高い活性が観察され、それらの発光強度は5H+K529Aで期待値の7.５倍、4H+K443Aで6.9倍に達した（図４）。また後者で得られた発光強度は、図４で得られたPCA法の場合の1000倍以上でかつ野生型酵素を用いた場合の１％を優に超える強度であった。また活性比率の最も高い変異体ペアである5HとK529Aについてその混合比を変化させて発光強度を測定したところ、図５に示すように混合比が１：１の時に活性が最も高くなった（反応時間３分）。このことから、活性上昇は二種類の変異体がIR-DNAにより単にプレート表面に濃縮されただけでなく、Zif12を介して二種類の変異体同士が１：１で近接したことに起因することが示唆された。さらに、5H と K529A、ならびに4H と K443Aを単に活性測定用バッファー中で１：１で混合（終濃度40 nM）して活性を測定した場合には、両者の平均の発光強度しか得られなかった（図６）。以上より、これらの変異体ペアを用いた場合、従来のPCA法では十分な活性回復が観測されない条件においても、ターゲットDNAと結合して、互いに接近することにより酵素活性が相補され、発光強度が顕著に増大したことが示された。また予想に反して、今回の実験系においてK443A変異体はK529A変異体とほぼ同等の機能を果たすことが明かとなった。\n\n(6) Luminescence intensity enhancement by mixing two kinds of mutants Select two of Zif12 fusion proteins obtained by immobilizing biotinylated IR DNA in a white 96-well plate as described above, and purifying the expression. Were mixed and dispensed so that the final concentration was 20 nM or a final concentration of 20 nM (total 40 nM), and the luminescence intensity was measured after washing as described above. Luminescence measurement was performed for 1 second from 3 seconds after addition of the substrate unless otherwise specified, and the average value of 3 samples was obtained. As a result, when the N domain and C domain, which are conventional PCA methods, were combined, only 1.3 times the luminescence intensity was observed with respect to the value (average value) expected from each luminescence activity (Fig. 4, \nMeasurement time\n 3 minutes). On the other hand, among the remaining combinations, when mixed in K529A / H245D (5H) + K529A, 5H + K443A, K443A / H245D (4H) + K529A, and 4H + K443A, significantly higher activity than expected was observed, Their emission intensity reached 7.5 times the expected value with 5H + K529A and 6.9 times with 4H + K443A (FIG. 4). Also, the luminescence intensity obtained in the latter was 1000 times or more that of the PCA method obtained in FIG. 4 and well over 1% when the wild type enzyme was used. Further, when the luminescence intensity was measured by changing the mixing ratio of the mutant pair 5H and K529A having the highest activity ratio, the activity was highest when the mixing ratio was 1: 1 as shown in FIG. \nReaction time\n 3 minutes). From this, the increase in activity is due to the fact that the two mutants were not only concentrated on the plate surface by IR-DNA, but also the two mutants were close together at 1: 1 via Zif12. Was suggested. Furthermore, when the activity was measured by simply mixing 5H and K529A, and 4H and K443A in an activity measurement buffer at a 1: 1 concentration (\nfinal concentration\n 40 nM), only the average luminescence intensity of both was obtained. (FIG. 6). As described above, when these mutant pairs are used, enzyme activity is complemented by binding to the target DNA and approaching each other even under conditions where sufficient activity recovery is not observed by the conventional PCA method, and the luminescence intensity is increased. A significant increase was shown. Contrary to expectations, it was revealed that the K443A mutant performs almost the same function as the K529A mutant in this experimental system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n実施例２：\n\n　実施例１の実験は固定化したDNAに結合した変異体の活性を測定するものであったが、ホモジニアスな溶液中で抗原添加による活性変化が観察されるかどうか検討した。より高い活性変化を得るため、中間体LH\n2\n-AMPを多く産生すると考えられるK443A/H245D変異体に対し中間体生成量が高まると期待されるL530R変異(Fujii et al., Anal. Biochem. 366, 131-136, 2007)を、さらに全ての変異体に対して安定性向上が期待される変異E354Kを導入した。すなわち、実施例２で作製したプラスミドは以下の通りである。\n\npET32-ZiF12-LucK443A/H245D/L530R/E354K : LucK443A/H245D/L530R/E354KとZif12との融合蛋白質発現ベクター\n\npET32-ZiF12-LucK529A/E354K : LucK529A/E354KとZif12との融合蛋白質発現ベクター\n\nExample 2: \n Although the experiment of Example 1 was to measure the activity of the mutant bound to the immobilized DNA, it was examined whether an activity change due to the addition of the antigen was observed in a homogeneous solution. In order to obtain a higher activity change, the L530R mutation (Fujii et al., Anal. Biochem. 366), which is expected to increase the amount of intermediate production compared to the K443A / H245D mutant, which is thought to produce a lot of intermediate LH \n2\n -AMP , 131-136, 2007), and also introduced the mutation E354K, which is expected to improve stability for all mutants. That is, the plasmid prepared in Example 2 is as follows. \n pET32-ZiF12-LucK443A / H245D / L530R / E354K: Fusion protein expression vector of LucK443A / H245D / L530R / E354K and Zif12 \n pET32-ZiF12-LucK529A / E354K: Fusion protein expression vector of LucK529A / E354K and Zif12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n（１）変異体プラスミドの構築\n\n　pET32-ZiF12-LucK443A/H245Dにクイックチェンジ法を適用し、プライマー１及び２を用いてFlucの354番目のグルタミン酸をリジンに、さらにプライマー３及び４を用いて530番目のロイシン残基をアルギニンに変異させたpET32-ZiF12-LucK443A/H245D/L530R/E354Kを構築した。また同様にしてpET32-ZiF12-LucK529AのFlucの354番目のグルタミン酸をリジンに変異させることで、pET32-ZiF12-LucK529A/E354Kを構築した。プラスミド構築の実験操作は、pET32-ZiF12-LucH245D等と同様に行った。\n\n(1) Construction of mutant plasmid Applying the quick change method to pET32-ZiF12-LucK443A / H245D, using \n \nprimer\n \n 1 and 2, 354th glutamic acid of Fluc as lysine, and 530th using \n \nprimers\n \n 3 and 4 PET32-ZiF12-LucK443A / H245D / L530R / E354K was constructed in which the leucine residue was mutated to arginine. Similarly, pET32-ZiF12-LucK529A / E354K was constructed by mutating 354rd glutamic acid of Fluc of pET32-ZiF12-LucK529A to lysine. The experimental procedure for plasmid construction was the same as for pET32-ZiF12-LucH245D and the like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nプライマー１：\n\n5'-TTCTGATTACACCCAAGGGGGATGATAAA-3'（配列番号１８）\n\nプライマー２：\n\n5'-TTTATCATCCCCCTTGGGTGTAATCAGAA-3'（配列番号１９）\n\nプライマー３：\n\n5’- CCGAAAGGTCTTACCGGTAAACGCGACGCAAGAAAAATCA-3'（配列番号２０）\n\nプライマー４：\n\n5’- TGATTTTTCTTGCGTCGCGTTTACCGGTAAGACCTTTCGG-3'（配列番号２１）\n\nPrimer 1: \n 5'-TTCTGATTACACCCAAGGGGGATGATAAA-3 '(SEQ ID NO: 18) \n Primer 2: \n 5'-TTTATCATCCCCCTTGGGTGTAATCAGAA-3 '(SEQ ID NO: 19) \n Primer 3: \n 5′-CCGAAAGGTCTTACCGGTAAACGCGACGCAAGAAAAATCA-3 ′ (SEQ ID NO: 20) \n Primer 4: \n 5'-TGATTTTTCTTGCGTCGCGTTTACCGGTAAGACCTTTCGG-3 '(SEQ ID NO: 21)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n（２）蛋白質の発現精製\n\n　得られた２種類のベクターを用いて、pET32-ZiF12-LucH245D等と同様に行った。\n\n(2) Protein expression purification The two types of vectors obtained were used in the same manner as pET32-ZiF12-LucH245D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n（３）２種の変異体へのDNA添加による発光強度増強\n\n　白色Half well 96穴プレート(Costar 3693, CorningCostar Inc., Corning, NY)に、発現精製して得られたZif融合LucK529A/E354KとZif融合LucK443A/H245D/L530R/E354Kをそれぞれ単独で5 nM、 あるいはそれぞれ5 nM （合計10 nM）になるように、100 mM Tricine, 1mg/ ml BSA, pH 8.0で希釈・混合して、50μlずつ分注した。それぞれの混合液に終濃度5 nMの非ビオチン化IR DNAを混合し、対照としてIR DNAを添加しない試料を用意した。ATTO AB-2350ルミノメーターのポンプで200 mM MOPS, 20 mM MgSO\n4\n, 2 mg/ml BSA, 75 μM LH\n2\n, 20 mM ATP, pH 7.0に調製した基質溶液を各50μl添加し、添加直後から0.1秒ずつ40秒間発光強度を測定し、3サンプルの平均値と標準偏差を求めた。まず、それぞれの変異体単独での測定を行ったところ、Zif融合LucK529A/E354KにIR DNAを混合した場合には、何も混合しなかった場合と比較して、基質添加4秒後に約1.05倍の発光強度が観察された。またZif融合LucK443A/H245D/L530R/E354KにIRを混合した場合には、何も混合しなかった場合と比較して、発光強度の上昇は見られなかった。これらに対し、Zif融合LucK529A/E354KとZif融合LucK443A/H245D/L530R/E354Kとの混合液にIRを混合した場合には、何も混合しなかった場合と比較して、基質添加4秒後に約1.19倍の発光強度が観察された (図７)。以上より、この変異体ペアを用いた場合、ターゲットDNA依存的に両者が接近することによって酵素活性が相補され、発光強度が顕著に増大したことが強く示唆された。\n\n(3) Luminescence intensity enhancement by adding DNA to two mutants Zif fusion LucK529A / E354K and Zif obtained by expression purification in white Half well 96-well plates (Costar 3693, CorningCostar Inc., Corning, NY) Dilute and mix the fused LucK443A / H245D / L530R / E354K with 100 mM Tricine, 1 mg / ml BSA, pH 8.0 to make 5 nM each, or 5 nM each (total 10 nM). Noted. Each mixture was mixed with non-biotinylated IR DNA at a final concentration of 5 nM, and a sample to which no IR DNA was added was prepared as a control. Add 50 μl each of the substrate solution adjusted to 200 mM MOPS, 20 mM MgSO \n4\n , 2 mg / ml BSA, 75 μM LH \n2\n , 20 mM ATP, pH 7.0 with an ATTO AB-2350 luminometer pump. The luminescence intensity was measured every second for 40 seconds, and the average value and standard deviation of three samples were obtained. First, each mutant alone was measured. When IR DNA was mixed with Zif-fused LucK529A / E354K, it was about 1.05 \ntimes\n 4 seconds after addition of the substrate compared to when nothing was mixed. The emission intensity of was observed. In addition, when IR was mixed with Zif-fused LucK443A / H245D / L530R / E354K, no increase in luminescence intensity was observed compared to the case where nothing was mixed. On the other hand, when IR was mixed in the mixed solution of Zif-fused LucK529A / E354K and Zif-fused LucK443A / H245D / L530R / E354K, compared to the case where nothing was mixed, about 4 seconds after addition of the substrate. An emission intensity of 1.19 times was observed (Fig. 7). From the above, it was strongly suggested that when this mutant pair was used, the enzyme activity was complemented and the luminescence intensity was remarkably increased by approaching both in a target DNA-dependent manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n（４）２種の変異体への抗体添加による発光強度増強\n\n　DNA添加以外の方法で溶液中で二つの融合タンパクを近接させることにより、同様の活性への効果が認められるかどうか検討した。Costar 3693プレートに、発現精製して得られたZif融合LucK529A/E354KとZif融合LucK443A/H245Dをそれぞれ10 nMになるように、100 mM Tricine, 1mg/ ml BSA, pH 8.0で希釈・混合して、50μlずつ分注した。それぞれの混合液にthioredoxin認識抗体　（Trx・Tag\nTM\n Monoclonal Antibody, Novagen, Cat.No. 71542-3）を1/1000加えたものと、対照として抗体を加えないものを用意し、これらに200 mM MOPS, 20 mM MgSO\n4\n, 2 mg/ml BSA, 300 μM LH\n2\n, 20 mM ATPを含むpH 7.0に調製した溶液を各50μl添加し、添加直後から2分間の発光強度を測定し、3サンプルの平均値と標準偏差を求めた。thioredoxin認識抗体を混合した場合、混合しなかった場合と比較して基質添加から2分間の積算値で約1.18倍の発光強度が測定された（図８）。以上より、この変異体ペアを用いた場合、融合タンパク中のpET32がコードするthioredoxin部分が抗体と結合し、互いに接近することによって酵素活性が相補され、発光強度が顕著に増大したことが強く示唆された。\n\n(4) Luminescence intensity enhancement by addition of antibody to two variants It was examined whether the same effect on activity could be observed by bringing two fusion proteins close together in solution by a method other than DNA addition. On a Costar 3693 plate, dilute and mix Zif fusion LucK529A / E354K and Zif fusion LucK443A / H245D obtained by expression purification with 100 mM Tricine, 1 mg / ml BSA, pH 8.0 to 10 nM each. 50 μl aliquots were dispensed. Prepare thioredoxin-recognizing antibody (Trx • Tag \n™\n Monoclonal Antibody, Novagen, Cat. No. 71542-3) in 1/1000 in each mixture and those without antibody as a control. Add 50 μl of each solution prepared to pH 7.0 containing MOPS, 20 mM MgSO \n4\n , 2 mg / ml BSA, 300 μM LH \n2\n , 20 mM ATP, measure the luminescence intensity for 2 minutes immediately after the addition, Average values and standard deviations were obtained. When the thioredoxin-recognizing antibody was mixed, the luminescence intensity was measured approximately 1.18 times as the integrated value for 2 minutes after the addition of the substrate compared to the case where the antibody was not mixed (FIG. 8). The above results strongly suggest that when this mutant pair is used, the thioredoxin part encoded by pET32 in the fusion protein binds to the antibody and is brought close to each other, thereby complementing the enzyme activity and significantly increasing the luminescence intensity. It was done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n実施例３：\n\n　実施例１、２では、DNA結合ドメインZif12を相互作用ドメインとして利用していたが、DNAによって、異なる変異体同士のヘテロダイマーのみならず、同一の変異体同士のホモダイマー形成も誘導されてしまうという問題があった。そこで、ヘテロダイマーを選択的に形成できる系としてFKBP12とFRBを選び、これらのラパマイシン依存的な二量体形成の発光活性への影響を評価した。\n\n（１）FKBP12およびFRBを融合させた変異体プラスミドの構築\n\n　ラパマイシンと結合して二量体形成が誘導されることが知られるFK506結合蛋白質12 kd断片(FKBP12)と、とFKBP-ラパマイシン結合蛋白質FRB(Choi et al., Science 273, 239-242, 1996)を、Zif12のかわりに相互作用ドメインとして使用し、溶液中で相互作用依存的な発光強度増強が得られるかどうか検討した。人工合成したFKBP12ならびにFRB (Mr Gene GMBH, Regensburg, Germany)（図９（配列番号２２及び２３）、並びに図１０（配列番号２４及び２５））をコードするプラスミドを、制限酵素Sfi IとNot Iで処理し、FKBP12およびFRBをコードする断片を単離した。これらを同じ制限酵素で処理してそれぞれZif12を除去したpET32-ZiF12-LucK443A/H245D/L530R/E354KとpET32-ZiF12- LucK529Q/E354Kに挿入し、pET-FKBP-LucK443A/H245D/L530R/E354KならびにpET-FRBP-LucK529Q/E354Kを得た。なおプラスミド構築の実験操作は、pET32-ZiF12-LucH245D等と同様に行った。\n\nExample 3: \n In Examples 1 and 2, the DNA-binding domain Zif12 was used as an interaction domain. However, DNA induces not only heterodimers of different mutants but also homodimers of the same mutants. There was a problem. Therefore, FKBP12 and FRB were selected as systems capable of selectively forming heterodimers, and the influence of these rapamycin-dependent dimer formation on luminescence activity was evaluated. \n (1) Construction of mutant plasmid fused with FKBP12 and FRB \nFK506 binding protein\n 12 kd fragment (FKBP12) known to bind to rapamycin and induce dimer formation, and FKBP-rapamycin binding protein FRB (Choi et al., Science 273, 239-242, 1996) was used as an interaction domain instead of Zif12 to investigate whether interaction-dependent enhancement of luminescence intensity could be obtained in solution. Plasmids encoding artificially synthesized FKBP12 and FRB (Mr Gene GMBH, Regensburg, Germany) (FIG. 9 (SEQ ID NOs: 22 and 23) and FIG. 10 (SEQ ID NOs: 24 and 25)) were cloned into restriction enzymes Sfi I and Not I. And fragments encoding FKBP12 and FRB were isolated. Insert these into pET32-ZiF12-LucK443A / H245D / L530R / E354K and pET32-ZiF12- LucK529Q / E354K, which were treated with the same restriction enzymes to remove Zif12 respectively, and pET-FKBP-LucK443A / H245D / L530R / E354K and pET -FRBP-LucK529Q / E354K was obtained. The experimental procedure for plasmid construction was the same as for pET32-ZiF12-LucH245D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n（２）蛋白質の発現精製\n\n　得られた２種類のベクターを用いて、pET32-ZiF12-LucH245D等と同様に行った。\n\n(2) Protein expression purification The two types of vectors obtained were used in the same manner as pET32-ZiF12-LucH245D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n（３）FKBP12あるいはFRBを融合させた２種の変異体へのラパマイシン添加による発光強度増強\n\n　ラパマイシン依存的なFKBP12、 FRBの会合により、FKBP12融合LucK443A/H245D/L530R/E354KとLucK529Q/E354Kの近接が誘導され、その結果活性が変化するかどうか検討した。Costar 3693プレートに、FKBP融合LucK443A/H245D/L530R/E354KとFRB融合LucK529Q/E354Kをそれぞれ250 nM （合計500 nM）になるよう、100 mM Tricine, 1 mg/ml BSA, pH 8.0で希釈・混合して、50μlずつ分注した。それぞれの混合液に終濃度1%メタノール中50 nMのラパマイシン溶液を混合し、対照として終濃度1%のメタノールのみを添加した試料を用意した。ルミノメーターのポンプで200 mM MOPS, 20 mM MgSO4, 2 mg/ml BSA, 75μM LH2, 20 mM ATP, pH 7.0に調製した基質溶液を各50μl添加し、添加直後から0.1秒ずつ10秒間発光強度を測定し、3サンプルの平均値と標準偏差を求めた。FKBP融合LucK443A/H245D/L530R/E354KとFRB融合LucK529Q/E354Kとの混合液にラパマイシンを混合しておいた場合に、ラパマイシンを混合しなかった場合と比較して、反応開始0.5秒後に約2.46倍の発光強度が観察された (図１１)。以上より、この変異体ペアを用いた場合、ラパマイシンを介したFKBPとFRBの結合によって両者が接近することによって酵素活性が相補され、発光強度が顕著に増大したことが強く示唆された。この際、異なる変異体同士のヘテロダイマーのみが形成されることにより、より高い応答性が得られたものと考えられる。\n\n(3) Increasing luminescence intensity by adding rapamycin to two mutants fused with FKBP12 or FRB The association of FKBP12-fused LucK443A / H245D / L530R / E354K and LucK529Q / E354K by the association of FKBP12 and FRB dependent on rapamycin It was examined whether activity was changed as a result. Dilute and mix FKBP fusion LucK443A / H245D / L530R / E354K and FRB fusion LucK529Q / E354K at 250 nM (total 500 nM) with 100 mM Tricine, 1 mg / ml BSA, pH 8.0. 50 μl was dispensed. Each mixture was mixed with a 50 nM rapamycin solution in 1% final methanol, and a sample was prepared by adding only 1% final methanol as a control. Add 50 μl each of the substrate solution adjusted to 200 mM MOPS, 20 mM MgSO4, 2 mg / ml BSA, 75 μM LH2, 20 mM ATP, pH 7.0 with a luminometer pump, and increase the luminescence intensity for 0.1 second for 10 seconds immediately after the addition. Measurements were made and the average and standard deviation of three samples were determined. When rapamycin is mixed in a mixture of FKBP-fused LucK443A / H245D / L530R / E354K and FRB-fused LucK529Q / E354K, it is approximately 2.46 times 0.5 seconds after the start of the reaction compared to the case where rapamycin is not mixed. Was observed (FIG. 11). From the above, it was strongly suggested that when this mutant pair was used, the enzymatic activity was complemented by the close proximity of FKBP and FRB via rapamycin, and the luminescence intensity was significantly increased. At this time, it is considered that higher responsiveness was obtained by forming only heterodimers of different mutants."

Background technique \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 斑蝥素（外,外 -2,3-二甲基 -7-氧代二环丙垸 [2.2.1]庚垸 -2,3-二羧酸酐， exo,exo-2,3-dimethyl-7-oxxbicyclo[2.2.1 ]heptane-2 ,3 -dicarboxylic acid anhydride) 是从中国斑蝥虫 iMylabris phalerata H cichorii 分离得到的活性成分。 已 有报道称斑蝥素具有抗多种人类癌症的活性。但是， 斑蝥素严重的肾毒性限制 了其作为化学治疗药物的应用。而且， 虽然人们进行了大量的生理和生化研究 寻找由斑蝥素所致的生长抑制及细胞死亡的原因，其作用和通路的主要分子机 制仍然不清楚。 \n Cantharidin (exo, exo-2,3-dimethyl-7-oxobicyclopropanil [2.2.1] heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride, exo, exo-2,3-dimethyl-7 -oxxbicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid anhydride) is an active ingredient isolated from the Chinese spotted mites iMylabris phalerata H cichorii. It has been reported that cantharidin has activity against a variety of human cancers. However, the severe nephrotoxicity of cantharidin limits its use as a chemotherapeutic drug. Moreover, although a large number of physiological and biochemical studies have been conducted to find the cause of growth inhibition and cell death caused by cantharidin, the main molecular mechanisms of its action and pathway remain unclear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 人们将斑蝥素的多种衍生物作为潜在的抗肿瘤剂进行了深入研究。合成去 甲斑蝥素衍生物是斑蝥素的去甲基化的类似物。这些衍生物具有与斑蝥素一样 可引起类似的生长抑制活性的临床能力， 但是具有强抑制的肾毒性和胃肠毒 性。斑蝥酸代表了最早商业化的斑蝥素抗肿瘤剂。但是， 这些化合物受限于它 们对正常细胞的毒性， 阻止了其作为有效的抗癌药物或化学疗法用于癌症治 疗。 \n Various derivatives of cantharidin have been intensively studied as potential anti-tumor agents. The synthetic norcantharidin derivative is an analog of demethylation of cantharidin. These derivatives have the clinical ability to cause similar growth inhibitory activity like cantharidin, but have strongly inhibited nephrotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity. Cantharidin represents the earliest commercial cantharidin antitumor agent. However, these compounds are limited by their toxicity to normal cells, preventing their use as effective anticancer drugs or chemotherapy for cancer treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 因此， 需要合成新的甲基斑蝥胺化合物作为带抗肿瘤效应的斑蝥素类似 物， 也需要对正常细胞具有减低毒性且对癌细胞具有增益细胞毒性的化合物。 这样的化合物能够可用于癌症治疗的抗癌药物或化学疗法。 发明内容 \n Therefore, there is a need to synthesize a novel methyl cantharidin compound as a cantharidin analog with an antitumor effect, and a compound which has reduced toxicity to normal cells and has cytotoxicity to cancer cells. Such compounds are capable of being used in anticancer drugs or chemotherapy for cancer treatment. Summary of the invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 本发明要解决的技术问题在于，针对现有技术的上述缺陷， 提供一种甲基 斑蝥胺化合物，其对正常细胞具有较低的细胞毒性且对癌细胞具有较高的细胞 \n\n毒性， 其包含化学式 （1 ) 所示的主链: \nThe technical problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide a methyl cantharidin compound which has low cytotoxicity to normal cells and has high cells to cancer cells in view of the above-mentioned drawbacks of the prior art.

In theory, a controlled release complex that is optimally designed for drug therapy has the least amount of pharmaceutical ingredient to treat or control the condition in the shortest amount of time. Advantages of the controlled release complex include extended drug activity, reduced frequency of administration, and improved user compliance. In addition, the controlled release complex can affect the time of activity and other characteristics, such as the blood level of the drug, and can affect the production of side effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 大多数可控释放复合物设计成初始释放即产生期望治疗效果的药物（活性 成分）量， 然后缓慢并持续地释放更低量的药物以在较长一段时间内维持治疗 或预防效果的水平。为了在体内维持药物的稳定水平， 药物必须以一定比率从 剂型释放以替代被机体代谢和排出的药物量。活性成分的可控释放可受到包括 但不限于 pH、 温度、 酶、 水或其它生理条件或物质在内的多种条件的影响。 \n Most controlled release complexes are designed to initially release the amount of drug (active ingredient) that produces the desired therapeutic effect, and then slowly and continuously release a lower amount of drug to maintain the level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over a longer period of time. In order to maintain a stable level of drug in the body, the drug must be released from the dosage form in a ratio to replace the amount of drug that is metabolized and excreted by the body.

Description\n\n\n\n\n CHOLINERGIC/SEROTONINERGIC RECEPTOR AND USES THEREOF\n\n\nFIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 TiAChR) chimeric receptors containing one or more regions homologous to a nicotinic cholinergic receptor and a serotoninergic receptor for measuring α7 nAChR function and methods and compositions useful in the identification of α7 nAChR agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators.\n\n\nIon channels are hydrophilic pores across the cellular membrane that open in response to stimulation to allow specific inorganic ions of appropriate size and charge to pass across the membrane. Depending on the nature of the ligand, ion channels expressed in the plasma membrane are broadly classified as voltage-gated ion channels (VGIC) or ligand- gated ion channels (LGIC) where the ligand usually is considered to be an extracellular messenger such as a neurotransmitter (Gopalakrishnan and Briggs, 2006) . Specific residues in ion channel proteins also determine the specificity for the inorganic ion transported including sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride ions.\n\n\nLigand-gated ion channels are essential in mediating communication between cells- These channels convert a chemical signal (often a neurotransmitter, as for example, acetylcholine) released by one cell into an electrical signal that propagates along a target cell membrane through specific \n\nion influx. A variety of neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter receptors exist in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Numerous families of ligand-gated receptors have been identified and categorized by their specific ligands and on the basis of sequence identity. These include receptors specific for acetylcholine, glutamate, glycine, GABA A, and 5- HT. nAChRs receptors, members of the cys-loop superfamily of LGIC, are widely characterized transmembrane proteins involved in the physiological responses to the neurotransmitter ACh and are distributed throughout both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) . The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are multiunit proteins of neuromuscular and neuronal origins and mediate synaptic transmission between nerve and muscle and between neurons upon interaction with the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) . Organizationally, nAChRs are homopentamers or heteropentamers composed of nine alpha and four beta subunits that co-assemble to form multiple subtypes of receptors that have a distinctive pharmacology. ACh is the endogenous ligand (agonist), while nicotine is a prototypical agonist that non-selectively activates all nAChRs. Functional nAChRs are widely expressed in the central nervous system and in the ganglia of the autonomic nervous system. nAChRs are involved in a range of synaptic and extra synaptic functions. In the peripheral nervous system, nAChRs mediate ganglionic neurotransmission whereas in the CNS, nicotinic cholinergic innervation mediates fast synaptic transmission and regulates processes such as transmitter release, synaptic plasticity and neuronal network integration by providing modulatory input to a range of other neurotransmitter systems. Thus, nAChR subtypes are implicated in a range of physiological and pathophysiological functions \n\nrelated to cognitive functions, learning and memory, reward, motor control, arousal and analgesia.\n\n\nThe α7 nAChR is a ligand-gated calcium channel formed by a homopentamer of α7 subunits . These receptors are expressed in several brain regions, especially localized at presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, regions critical to the synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory. Presynaptic α7 nAChRs present on GABAergic, glutamatergic and cholinergic neurons can facilitate directly or indirectly the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate, GABA and norepinephrine whereas postsynaptic receptors can modulate other neuronal inputs and trigger a variety of downstream signaling pathways. This facilitation of pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms by α7 nAChRs could influence synaptic plasticity, important for cognitive functions involved in attention, learning, and memory. Support for this hypothesis has emerged from preclinical studies with selective agonists, antagonists, and more recently, positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) . Structurally diverse α7 nAChR agonists such as PNU-282987, SSR-180711A and AR-R17779 can improve performance in social recognition (Van Kampen, M. et. al., 2004), maze training (Levin, E. D. et. al., 1999; Arendash, G. W. et. al, 1995) and active avoidance (Arendash, G. W. et. al, 1995) models while α7 nAChR antagonists or antisense impair such performance (Bettany, J. H. et. al., 2001; Felix, R. and Levin, E. D., 1997; Curzon, P. et. al., 2006). Both agonists and PAMs, exemplified respectively by PNU-282987 and PNU-120596, have also been shown to reverse auditory gating deficits in animal models (Hajos, M. et. al., 2005; Hurst et al, 2005).\n\n\nAlthough α7 nAChRs have significant Ca2+ permeability comparable to NMDA receptors, these receptors do not require membrane depolarization for activation, and the current \n\nresponses are curtailed by rapid receptor desensitization processes (Quick, M. W., and Lester, R. A. J., 2002). The functional significance of α7 nAChRs is not only attributable to its electrogenic properties (i.e. modulation of neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release) but also to its high Ca\n2+\n-perπ\\eability and association with biochemical signaling pathways. Thus, activation of α7 nAChR can result in increased intracellular Ca2+, leading to signal transduction cascades involving the activation of a variety of protein kinases and other proteins by phosphorylation. Proteins that are phosphorylated in response to α7 nAChR activation could include extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) (Ren, K. et. al . , 2005), cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) (Roman, J. et. al., 2001) and Akt (Shaw, S. H. et. al., 2002).\n\n\nThe rapid receptor desensitization (within 50-100 milliseconds) of α7 nAChRs greatly limits the development of functional assays required for measurement of channel activity. A simple and high throughput assay is critical for screening for ligands that interact with the α7 nAChR with potential for the treatment of diseases where cognitive deficits remain an underlying component.\n\n\nSerotonin (5-hydroxytryρtamine, or 5-HT) receptors belong to at least two superfamilies: G-protein-associated receptors and ligand-gated ion channels. The majority of 5-HT receptors couple to effector molecules through G-protein coupled receptors. However, the 5-HT\n3\n receptor functions as a rapidly activating ion channel and, like other LGIC family members, incorporates a nonselective cation channel in its primary structure. 5-HT\n3\n receptors are expressed in native central and peripheral neurons where they are thought to play important roles in sensory processing and control of autonomic reflexes \n\n (Richardson, B. P., et al., 1985). 5-HT3 channels desensitize much slower than α7 nAChR.\n\n\nTherefore, a chimeric receptor prepared from the human N- terroinal ligand binding domain of α7 nAChR and the pore forming C-terminal domain of the human 5-HT3 would preserve the ligand selectivity for human α7 nAChR while delay the desensitization of the receptor. The delayed desensitization would make it easier to measure the channel function of α7 nAChR. Other amino acid stretches containing different segments of the α7 nAChR could be introduced to generate additional chimeras. Such chimeric receptors would be particularly useful for functional screening and identifying novel α7 nAChR agonists, modulators and antagonises.\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\nFigure 1.

Incorporation of additional amino acid stretches such as the M2-M3 segment of the α7 nAChR confers novel screening opportunities, particularly for allosteric modulators.\n\n\nThe principal embodiment of the present invention is a recombinant nucleic acid encoding a fully human amino acid \n\nsequence of a cholinergic/serotoninergic chimeric receptor. A preferred embodiment of said recombinant nucleic acid comprises an amino acid sequence of the fully human cholinergic/serotoninergic chimeric receptor comprising an amino acid extracellular domain with the sequence of a human neuronal nicotinic cholinergic subunit receptor, and an amino acid intracellular domain with the sequence of a human serotonin receptor. In another embodiment of the present invention the fully human cholinergic/serotoninergic chimeric receptor amino acid sequence comprises an amino acid extracellular domain with the sequence of a human neuronal nicotinic cholinergic subunit receptor, an amino acid intracellular domain with the sequence of a human serotonin receptor, and a four-transmembrane domain with an amino acid sequence of a human serotonin receptor.\n\n\nA more preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises the encoded fully human cholinergic/serotoninergic chimeric receptor amino acid sequence, in which the human neuronal nicotinic cholinergic subunit is an α7 subunit and the human serotonin receptor is a 5HT3 receptor.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the present invention comprises the fully human cholinergic/serotoninergic chimeric receptor amino acid sequence, in which part of the sequence of the transmembrane domain is from a human neuronal nicotinic cholinergic subunit receptor, in which the N-terminal extracellular domain is from human serotonin receptor is a 5HT\n3\n receptor, and in which the transmembrane domain is from a human neuronal nicotinic cholinergic subunit receptor.\n\n\nIt is intended that the nucleic acid sequence of the present invention can be selected from the group consisting of SEQ.ID.NO:1, SEQ.ID.NO:2, SEQ.ID.NO:3, SEQ.ID.NO:4, SEQ.ID.NO:5, SEQ.ID,NO:6, SEQ.ID.NO:7, and SEQ.ID.NO:8. It is also intended that the amino acid sequence encoded by any of \n\nsaid nucleic acid sequences is selected from the group consisting of SEQ.ID.NO.-9, SEQ. ID. NO: 10, SEQ. ID.NOrll, SEQ.IDNO:12, SEQ. ID. NO: 13, SEQ. ID. NO: 14, SEQ. ID. NO: 15, and SEQ.ID.NO:16. Another embodiment of the present invention comprises a vector containing any of the recombinant nucleic acid sequences of the present invention. It is intended that the vector is operable linked to control sequences recognized by a host cell transformed with the vector. Another embodiment of the present invention comprises a host cell comprising the vector of the present invention; it is intended that the host cell is a cell line derived from mammalian cells, primary mammalian cell cultures, or oocytes. Another embodiment of the present invention comprises a fully human cholinergic/serotoninergic chimeric receptor encoded by the recombinant nucleic acid sequence of the present invention. It is intended that the present invention also includes a method of manufacturing the chimeric receptor of the invention, comprising a cholinergic/serotoninergic chimeric receptor with one or more regions of a human neuronal nicotinic receptor subunit and a human serotonin receptor with the vector of the invention.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the present invention includes a composition comprising a cholinergic/serotoninergic chimeric receptor comprising one or more regions of a human neuronal nicotinic receptor subunit. and a human serotonin receptor, preferably wherein the composition comprises any of the amino acid sequences described in the present invention.\n\n\nAnother embodiment includes a method of screening for compounds that bind to a region of the fully human cholinergic/serotoninergic chimeric receptor of the present invention. Said region is selected from the N-terminal domain, C-terminal domain and the extracellular loop between \n\nTM2-TM3, to modulate the activity of a neuronal nicotinic receptor. The screening method of the present invention is selected from binding or activity-based assays. Said assays can be used to determining whether the test compound binds or modulates the chimeric receptor of the present invention, wherein the binding or modulation is indicative that the test compound binds or modulates the neuronal nicotinic receptor.\n\n\nA preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a method of screening for a compound that binds or modulates the activity of a neuronal nicotinic receptor, comprising introducing a host cell expressing the chimeric receptor of the present invention into an acceptable medium, and monitoring an effect in said host cell indicative of binding or modulation of the test compound with the chimeric receptor, wherein the binding or modulation is indicative that the test compound binds or modulates the neuronal nicotinic receptor.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the present invention is a kit comprising a host cell transformed or transfected with an expression vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a chimeric receptor of the present invention.\n\n\nIt is intended that any of the embodiments described herein can be modified in various obvious respects by the skilled in the art, and that all of the obvious modifications are included in the present invention. A chimeric receptor prepared from the human N-terminal ligand binding domain of α7 nAChR and the pore forming C- terminal domain of the human 5-HT3 would preserve the ligand selectivity for human α7 nAChR while delaying the desensitization of the receptor. The delayed desensitization would make it easier to measure the channel function of α.7 nAChR. The chimeras of the present invention that host the N- terminal fragment along with the extracellular TMII-III loop corresponding to the α7 nAChR sequence are particularly useful \n\nfor functional screening and identifying novel α7 nAChR ligands, i.e. agonists, modulators and antagonists. In addition, the human-human chimeric receptors described in the present application would be expected to better preserve the nature of human α7 nAChR as compared to human-rat chimera (Hurst et al, 2005) .\n\n\nThe α7 nAChR-5-HT3 chimeric receptors of the present invention is also useful for α7 nAChR ligand binding assays. Ligand binding can be measured using either whole cells or membrane preparations but both kinds of assays are cumbersome. Whole cell assays are usually low throughput, while the assays using isolated membranes from animal brains typically require extensive manipulation and washing to obtain a favorable signal to noise ratio. A binding assay using cell membranes from HEK-293 cells stably transfected with α7 nAChR-5HT3 chimeric receptors of the present invention that show similar binding properties to that of wild type ct7 nAChR, would be extremely useful for high throughput drug screening.\n\n\nPositive allosteric modulators (PAMs) have, in general, been shown not to affect α7 nAChR channel function by themselves, but can selectively enhance the effect of α7 nAChR agonists. Two types of PAMs have been described: PAM I that enhances amplitude of inward currents only (Zwart R. et. al., 2002) and PAM II that delays desensitization of the receptor and enhancing amplitude of inward currents (Hurst et al, 2005, Grønlien et al, 2007) . PAM II type has been shown to enhance the acetylcholine-evoked inward currents in hippocampal interneurons on brain slice and improved the auditory gating deficit when systemically administrated to rats, suggesting that PAM II may be used as a new class of molecule that enhances α7 nAChR function and thus has the potential to treat psychiatric and neurological disorders. The binding site of \n\nPAMI/II on α7 nAChR and mechanism of their action remain unclear. These fundamental questions could be answered by using cc7 nAChR-5HT3 chimeric receptors with various replacements of domains of 5-HT3 with those of α7 nAChR. More importantly, the α7 nAChR-5HT3 chimeric receptors can also be used to screen for both novel α7 agonists and positive allosteric modulators.

Using PCR, coding sequence for the N-terminal 224 amino acids of human α7 nicotinic receptor (α7 nAChR, protein AAA83561) and that for the C-terrainal 242 amino acids of human 5- hydroxytryptamine type-3 (5-HT3) serotonin receptor (protein AAP35868) were amplified with overlapping ends. Recombinant PCR using these two overlapping fragments yielded the open reading frame of Chimera 1. Primers used to generate the α7 ^ nAChR portion of this chimera were (5' to 3') ..

The primers listed in these methods were manufactured and HPLC purified by Sigma Genosys . PCR was performed in a Stratagene Robocycler using IOng each template, 0.4μM each primer with Invitrogen Platinum\n3\n Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity following Invitrogen' s protocol. Recombinant PCR used lμl of amplicon directly from each of the two reactions along with 0.4μM each of primers A7F and SHT3R. All else are equal to the primary PCR. The recombinant PCR product was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1 using Invitrogen' s pcDNA3.1 TOPO TA cloning kit and transformed into DH5 alpha Max Efficiency Chemically Competent Bacteria from Invitrogen following the protocol. Clones were selected on plates containing LB agar medium and lOOμg/ml ampicillin. The sequence of the inserted DNA was verified. Chimera 2: Chimera 2 has the same amino acid composition as Chimera 1 except that 10 amino acids between transmembrane spanning (TM) region 2 and TM3 have been changed to be amino f— CSif&ϊDΛJOfzn acids 280-289 of α7 nAChR (AEIMPATSDS) instead of amino acids\n\n\n298-307 of 5-HT3 (SDTLPATAIG\n1\n) . This was accomplished through PCR amplifying two fragments that flank the region of interest, overlap each other with codons for the desired α7 nAChR sequence, and extend to unique restriction enzyme sites for EcoRI and Bsu36l that flank the region of interest. Recombinant PCR using these two fragments produced a single amplicon to be digested with the aforementioned restriction enzymes and cloned into analogous sites of Chimera 1.

PCR was performed as described above except ^J^PJJØ/\n,\n \n\n that Chimera 1 plasmid was used as template in each of the two reactions. Recombinant PCR used lμl of amplicon directly from each of the two reactions along with 0.4μM each of primers A7. ECORlF and 5HT. BSUR. The product from the recombinant PCR was purified using Qiagen' s Qiaquick Purification kit following the protocol. EcoRI and Bsu36I from New England Biolabs were used to digest approximately 5μg of the purified PCR product in NEBuffer 3 for 2 hours at 37 °C. This digestion product (insert) was then purified using the Qiaquick method. These same restriction enzyme conditions were used to digest lμg Chimera 1 plasmid. The Chimera 1 plasmid digestion product was electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose and the large band was purified from the small EcoRI-Bsu36l fragment by gel purification. The purified insert and plasmid were then ligated using NEB Quick Ligase following the protocol and transformed into DH5 alpha Max Efficiency Chemically Competent Bacteria from Invitrogen. Clones were selected on plates containing LB agar medium and lOOμg/ml ampicillin. The sequence of the inserted DNA was verified. Chimera 3: Chimera 3 has the same amino acid composition as Chimera 2 except that the last 3 amino acids (originally 5- HT3 amino acids 482-484, QYA) have been replaced by the 9 most C-terminal amino acids of α.7 nAChR (VEAVSKDFA) . This was accomplished by manufacturing the replacement sequence encoding these 9 amino acids with flanking restriction enzyme sites for Nhel and Apal and then cloning this piece into the (S €0.7\"J?\n\n\n \n\n .NHEIF-forward) and\n\n\nGGGCCCTCACGCAAAGTCTTTGGACACGGCCTCCACCCAGATGGACCAGAGCATAACCAGGG\n\n\n \n\ninsert- PCR was performed as described above except that no template was added to the reaction; the primers alone acted as template. Approximately 5μg of the product from this reaction was purified using Qiagen's Qiaquick Purification Kit following the protocol and digested with Nhel and Apal from New England Biolabs in NEBuffer 4 for 2 hours at 37°C. Chimera 2 plasmid {lμg) was digested similarly. Agarose electrophoresis using 0.8% agarose was used to purify the manufactured insert from its cleaved ends and also to purify the Chimera 2 plasmid from the small Nhel-Apal fragment. The prepared insert was then ligated to the prepared Chimera 2 plasmid using NEB Quick Ligase following the protocol and transformed into DH5 alpha Max Efficiency Chemically Competent Bacteria from Invitrogen. Clones were selected on plates containing LB agar medium and lOOμg/ml ampicillin. The sequence of the inserted DNA was verified.\n\n\nChimera 4 ; Chimera 4 has the same amino acid composition as Chimera 1 except that the loop between transmembrane-3 portion (TM3) and transmembrane-4 portion (TM4) of 5HT-3 have been replaced with that of α7 nAChR. This was accomplished by combination of three fragments.\n\n\n(1) The ligand binding domain to TM3 fragments: This fragment contains the coding sequences of the human α7 nAChR ligand binding domain starting at the unique EcoRI site upstream the αl nAChR ligand binding domain, through 5HT-3\n\n\n \n\n eliminates an existing BsmBI site.

Clones were selected on plates containing LB agar medium and lOOμg/ml ampicillin. The sequence of the inserted DNA of was verified.\n\n\n(Ill) Techniques (1) ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY\n\n\nXenopus laevis oocytes were prepared and injected as previously described {Eisele, 1993 #2; Krause, 1998 #4}. Briefly, ovaries were harvested from female Xenopus. Isolation of the oocytes was obtained by enzymatic dissociation using collagenase type I in a medium deprived of calcium and by gentle mechanical agitation for approximately 3 hours. Oocytes stage 5-6 were manually selected on the next day and injected into the nucleus with 2 ng plasmid containing the cDNA of interest. Oocytes were then placed in a 96 well microtiter plate in Barth solution and used for electrophysiological investigation two to five days later. All recordings were performed at 18 \n0\nC and cells were superfused with 0R2 medium containing in mM : NaCl 82.5, KCl 2.5, HEPES 5, CaCl\n2\n.2H\n2\nO 2.5, MgCl\n2\n.6H\n2\nO 1, pH 7.4, and 0.5 μM atropine was added to prevent possible activation of endogenous muscarinic receptors. Unless indicated cells were held at -100 mV using a two electrode voltage clamp apparatus connected to a Geneclamp amplifier (Molecular Devices) . Data were captured and analyzed using data acquisition and analysis software. Concentration- response curves were fit using the empirical Hill equation: Y=I / 1+ ( EC\n5\no/ x) \nΛ\nΛ\nH\n where: y = the fraction of remaining current, EC\n50\n = concentration of half inhibition, n\nH\n = the apparent cooperativity, x = agonist concentration. Values \n\nindicated throughout the text are given with their respective standard error of the mean (SEM) . For statistical analysis we used the unpaired, two-tailed Student' s T test using either excel (Microsoft) or Matlab (Mathworks Inc.). (2) MEMBRANE POTENTIAL MEASUREMENT\n\n\nHEK-293 cells stably expressing human α7 nAChR-5HT3 chimeric receptors were grown to confluence in 162-175 cm\n3\n tissue culture flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.6 mg/ml G-418. The cells were then dissociated using cell dissociation buffer and resuspended in the growth medium. Cells were plated at 100 ul of cell suspension (~ 60,000 - 80,000 cells/well) into 96-well black plates (poly-D-lysine precoated) with clear bottom and maintained for 24-48 hrs in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C under an atmosphere of 5% CO\n2\n: 95% air. On the day of testing, responses were measured using Fast Membrane Potential (FMP) dye (Molecular Devices) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a stock solution of the dye was prepared by dissolving each vial supplied by the vendor in low Ca\n2+\n and low Mg\n2+\n Hank' s balanced salt solution buffer (HBSS) containing 10 mM HEPES and 0.5 uM atropine. The low Ca\n2+\n and Mg\n2\n* HBSS buffer was obtained by adding 0.1 mM CaC12 and 0.1 mM MgC12 to Ca\n24\n and Mg\n2+\n free HBSS. Instead of Ca\n2\n* and Mg\n2+\n free HBSS, Ca\n2+\n and Mg\n2+\n free PBS can also be used. The dye stock solution was diluted 1:10 with the same buffer before use. The growth media was removed from the cells. The cells were loaded with 100 ul of the dye per well and incubated at room temperature for up to 1 hr. Fluorescence measurements were read simultaneously from all the wells by a Fluorometic Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and by using an emission filter provided by Molecular Devices specifically for the fluorescence membrane potential (FMP) . Depending on the \n\npurpose of experiments either a single addition or double addition protocol was used. In a single addition (agonist) protocol, the basal fluorescence was measured for 10 sec and 50 ul of compounds (3-fold higher concentration) was added, and responses measured for up to 10 min. In the double addition (modulator) protocol, basal fluorescence was measured for 10 sec then 50 ul (3-fold higher concentration) of test compounds were added in the first addition for 5 - 10 min followed by 50 ul of the second compound addition (4-fold higher concentration) . The double addition protocol can be used to measure antagonist ox positive allosteric modulator activity when the second addition utilizes submaximum concentration of an agonist. Data were normalized to maximal responses of a reference α7 nAChR agonist (100 uM acetylcholine or 1 uM NS6784) and plotted as a function of concentration in agonist experiments or to submaximum response of the reference agonist (60-120 nM NS6784) . (3) RADIOLIGAND BINDING\n\n\n[\n3\nH]-A585539, also known as ( [\n3\nH] - (S, S) -2, 2-dimethyl-5- (6- phenyl-pyridazin-3-yl)-5-aza-2-azonia-bicyclo[2.2.1] heptane iodide) or [\n3\nH]-DPPB (U.S. patent application number 20070072892A1) , binding to α7 nAChR-5HT3 chimeric receptors was determined using cellular membranes. Adherent cells were scraped from tissue culture flasks using Dulbecco's PBS with 0.1 mM PMSF. The cells were centrifuged at 500 X g for 10 min and the pellets were homogenized with a Polytron at a setting of 7 for 20 sec in 30 volumes of BSS-Tris buffer (120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, and 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 4\n0\nC) . After centrifugation at 500 x g for 10 min, the resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 15 min. The membrane pellets were resuspended in BSS to result in 2-5 mg protein per aliquot. Maximal binding levels (B\nMΛX\n) and dissociation constants (K\n0\n) were determined using 8-16 \n\nconcentrations from 0.05 to 5 nM of [\n3\nH] -A585539 (62.8 Ci/mmol; R46V, Abbott Labs). Samples were incubated in a final volume of 500 μl for 75 min at 4°C in quadruplicate. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM (-) nicotine in duplicate. Bound radioactivity was collected on Millipore\n\n\nMultiscreen® harvest plates FB presoaked with 0.3% PEI using a PerkinElmer cell harvester, washed with 2.5 ml ice-cold buffer, and radioactivity was determined using a PerkinElmer TopCount® microplate beta counter. K\nn\n and B\nMAX\n values were determined from nonlinear regression analysis of untransformed data using GraphPad Prism®. For displacement curves, seven log-dilution concentrations of test compounds containing 2-5 μg of protein, and 0.5 nM [\n3\nH]-A585539 (62.8 Ci/mmol; R46V, Abbott Labs) were incubated in a final volume of 500 μl for 75 minutes at 4\n0\nC in duplicate. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of lOμM methyllycaconitine. IC\n50\n values were determined by nonlinear regression in Microsoft® Excel or Assay Explorer. Ki values were calculated from the IC\n50\nS using the Cheng-Prusoff equation, where Ki = IC\n5\no/(l+[Ligand]/K\nD\n) .\n\n\n(IV) Examples\n\n\nExample 1. EXPRESSION OF CHIMERAS AND RESPONSES TO α7 nAChR\n\n\nAGONISTS All engineered chimeras contain the α7 encoded N-terminal extracellular region, which contains the agonist binding sites. Therefore, α7 agonists, but not 5-HT3A agonists, should activate these channels. All α7-5HT3 chimeras were screened for functional expression by injecting the cDNA in Xenopυs laevis oocytes. Figure 2 shows all 7 chimeras expressed in Xenopus oocytes were activated by acetylcholine (Ach) by electrophysiology (two electrode voltage clamp) . As \n\ndemonstrated in the figure, Ach activated currents in all chimeras. Figure 2 also shows that NS1738, a positive allosteric modulator NS1738 can differentially potentiate various chimeras activated by the endogenous agonist, acetylcholine. Secondly, unlike at the wild type α.7 nAChRs,\n\n\nNS1738 alone generally activated current responses when the α7 encoded sequence for extracellular TMII-III loop was present.\n\n\nThe α7 nAChR-like channel function of the chimeras was confirmed by currents evoked by ACh and choline in HEK-293 cells stably expressing chimera 1 and 2. Figure 3 (a) and (b) show representative currents evoked by Ach and choline, as indicated by horizontal bars, in HEK-293-chimera 1 and HEK- 293-chimera 2 cells, respectively. Responses were measured using the patch clamp technique and compound were applied using rapid compound addition, holding potential was -80 mV. In general, chimera 2 currents had higher amplitudes and showed slower decay rates than chimera 1.\n\n\nFigure 4a shows s series of concentration-responses to four agonists measured in HEK-293-chimera 2 cells using FMP dye in FLIPR. The rank order of potency is as follows: NS6784 (2- (1, 4-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-4-yl) -5-phenyl-l, 3, 4- oxadiazole}~ PNU-282,987 > ACh > choline. This shows that stable cell lines generated from the novel chimeras can be used to screen for agonists, antagonists, or allosteric modulators. In chimera 1 and 2 cells, the current and membrane potential responses could be evoked in concentration dependent manner by a7 agonists such as: Ach, choline, PNU- 282,987, or NS6784. Figure 4b shows concentration responses to ACh and choline recorded in Xenopus leavis oocytes expressing chimera 2 examined using Parallel Oocyte Electrophysiology Test Station (POETs) . ACh is more potent than choline similarly to what was observed in FLIPR-FMP experiments. Figure 4c shows specific binding of (\n3\nH]-A585539 to membranes \n\nobtained from HEK-293 cells expressing chimera-1 or chimera 2. The effect of increasing unlabelled A-585539, a selective α7 agonist, on displacement of [3H] A-585539 in homogenates prepared from HEK-293-chimera 2 cells, was used for determination of affinity of this compound. As shown, [\n3\nH]A- 585539 bound to a single saturable site with high affinity K\nD\n equal to 0.17 nM. The Bmax was also high, 29167 fmol/mg protein, indicating high expression of chimera 2 in this cell line. Binding was high, saturable, rapid and represented >95% of total binding over the concentration range, 0.05 to 5 nM, examined. The dissociation constants (K\n0\n) of 0.65 and 0.17 nM were determined for chimeras 1 and 2 respectively. The studies of electrophysiology, membrane potential measurement, and radioligand binding in chimera 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 1. The comparison of potencies in chimera 1 and 2 cells illustrates that EC\n5\nO values in the former were shifted to the left by 2-5-fold consistent with the observed shift in the affinity to [\n3\nH] A-585539 (Table 1) . These results indicate that the chimeras, especially chimera 1 and chimera 2, function as ct7 nAChR-selective ion channels and will be useful for screening various types of α7-nAChR-selective ligands including, agonists, antagonists, and allosteric modulators. Example 2. RESPONSES OF CHIMERAS TO POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATORS ( PAMs ) . As described previously (Gronlien et al. MoI Pharmacol.\n\n\n2007) , genistein and 5-hydroxyindole (5-HI) potentiate α7 nAChR agonist -evoked currents by primarily increasing the current amplitude and with relatively little effect on time course of current response. These positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) were examined to determine whether these compounds could modulate the chimeras. Figures 5 - 7, show that genistein and 5-HI had differential effects on chimeras. \n\n In chimera 2, 30 μM genistein not only potentiated peak amplitude of ACh current responses, but affected the time course of the response resulting in weakly or non-decaying decaying current. In addition, the time course of the response in chimera 2 was affected differently by genistein in comparison to the wild type α7. At the wild type al , genistein potentiates the α7 agonist evoked a7 currents by primarily increasing the current amplitude (Figure 5) .\n\n\nFigure 6 demonstrate that chimeras such as chimera-2 (illustrated) can be utilized for screening for novel PAMs. Concentration-responses to three α7 PAMs - 5-HI, NS1738, and genistein, potentiating submaximum NS6784 evoked responses (60 nM) in HEK-293-chimera 2 cells. The protocol employed here to determine the PAM activity is known to one skilled in the art, and involves using a submaximum concentration of a chosen α7 agonist - corresponding to EC\n2\n0 to EC50 - such as 60 nM of NS6784 in FLIPR experiments or 100 μM ACh in Xenopus oocyte studies, and determination of concentration-dependency of test compounds to affect these submaxmium agonist signals. As shown in figure 6, reference PAMs with various potencies such as genistein, 5HI and NS1738 were identified by examining membrane potential responses in chimera-2.\n\n\nFigure 7 shows differential potentiation by genestein in chimeras 1 and 2. In chimera 1 - lacking the α7 encoded sequence for extracellular TMII-III loop - genistein was not effective as positive allosteric modulator. In contrast, in chimera 2 - containing the α7 encoded sequence for extracellular TMII-III loop - genestein was very effective. This differential potentiation of chimera 2, and not chimera 1, was confirmed electrophysiologically (see Figure 7C), wherein genestein potentiated ACh responses in chimera 2, but not chimera 1. This demonstrates that the α7-encoded \n\nsequence for extracellular TMII-III loop was critical for the positive allosteric modulation by genestein. In contrast to genestein, two other PAMs, NS1738 (Timrnermann et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007) and 5-hydroxyindole, were able to potentiate both chimeras.\n\n\nFigure 8 shows differential effects of NS1738 and PNU- 120596 in chimera 1 and 2; NS1738 potentiates chimera 1, whereas PNϋ-120596 does not. The observation that genistein differentially potentiates chimeras offers unique opportunities to screen compounds capable of potentiating wild-type α7. Compounds such as genistein that selectively potentiate chimera (e.g. chimera 2) containing the α7 encoding TMII-III loop (e.g. chimera 2) can be identified by using this type of chimeric receptors and not when TMII-III loop is encoded by 5-HT3A. Therefore, the advantage of using these chimeras is that PAMs of certain types or pharmacological properties can be readily identified."

Description\n\n\n\n\n THERAPEUTIC COMPOSITIONS, DEVICES AND METHODS FOR OBSERVING TREATED TISSUES\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a non-invasive medical therapy, and compositions for avoiding organ transplantation, reducing rejection of transplanted organs, or treating organs under consideration for replacement by transplant, and otherwise treating aged, diseased or abnormal tissues and organs. The composition and methods of the invention may also be used to augment the treatment of multiple diseases and disorders of the body such as and inclusive of dermatological disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, ophthalmic disorders (such as diseased corneas), neurologic disorders, bacterial infections, respiratory disorders, tracheo-bronchial disorders, and various disorders related to aging. The present invention involves administering to a patient a therapeutic formulation comprising a free L-amino acid non- chiral glycine profile, simulating or replicating the proteins normally present in healthy tissue that is now diseased or transplanted tissue. The invention also relates to therapy involving administration of therapeutic formulations comprising free L-amino acids in which the molar ratios of the amino acids correspond to the ratios of components such as amino components in a medication that is useful for treating a disease. By simultaneous administration of the various components of one of the therapeutic formulations, the components are able to work synergistically to restructure diseased tissue and organs. The invention also relates to providing pharmacologic mechanisms for this synthesized therapeutic biologic, that becomes activated in-vivo as a therapeutic agent in restructuring diseased tissue. The pharmacologic mechanisms provided are not only anti-inflammatory, but also tissue healing, mediated by the foregoing composition's organizational matrix and matrices therapeutic intervention, to therapeutically enable diseased tissue to meet the dictum that DNA, RNA templating provides for protein synthesis by providing the interventional raw material such as L-amino acids and glycines specified by the genetic code of the targeted protein. At first believed to be epigenetic, it is now believed to be also a genetic therapeutic opportunity to non-invasively modify the genetic cycle without crossing immuno-inflammatory barrier with introduction of DNA, RNA and protein macromolecules that would induce cytokine inflammatory reactions. This now provides DNA, RNA, amino acids protein synthesis stimulating therapeutics to provide healing protein. Healing is dependent upon the resolution of inflammation \n\n synergistically co-existing with healing tissue repair and regeneration, all becoming activated therapeutically in-vivo. This imunologically privileged therapeutics crosses species barriers and cell lines. This multiplicity of species barriers' adaptation is evidenced by disease resolution in pre-clinical studies in equine animal health therapeutics. This inventive synthetic biologic therapeutics thereby provides the activation of the patient's own stem cells non-invasively, providing repair, regeneration and disease resolution applicable even to diseases of poor prognosis. This invention further provides the same molecular embryologic mechanisms to synergistically provide the embryogenesis involved in healing, cell and tissue repair and regeneration in disease reversal,. The invention also relates to providing therapeutic immunologic 'self as a bio-chemically invisible therapeutics that also has the pharmacologic dynamics of significantly reducing the inflammatory cytokine chemo- attractant mediators, as well as providing anti-inflammatory interleukin receptor antagonists.\n\n\nThis bimolecular epigenetic and genetic activation of the patient's own stem cells in cell/tissue healing, referred to as immuno-therapeutics, can be brought about by a newly discovered biomolecular composition that can reverse and provide resolution for diseases of poor or guarded prognosis.\n\n\nFurther, new instrumentation described herein will provide tracking of the therapeutic response, as well as the potential of biopsy-like diagnoses, measured by the degree of hydrophilicity of the phospholipids, L amino acids, glycine and extracellular matrix polar surface lipid active components. These therapeutics mimics normal human and mammalian tissues' degree of birefringence with polarized light. This in turn offers the potential of measuring, with a probe, a screening test for abnormal tissue, exemplified in diseases such as cancer, which lack the birefringence and its associated molecular and tissue structural organization. The subject invention also pertains to the visualization of wound and/or tissue healing, utilizing polarizing light microscopy technology.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nThe present invention is useful for the treatment of many disorders, particularly tissue or organ failure (such as kidney or liver failure), corneal disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and dermatological disorders. Presently, many of the methods of therapy for these disorders involve invasive surgical methods, such as organ transplant in the case of extreme tissue damage. Organ transplantation involves many risks, such as complications resulting from the anesthesia and surgical procedures, side effects from medications, such as cyclosporin, which \n\n help prevent organ rejection, and the risks of blood borne pathogens or shock if transfusions are needed. Moreover, organ transplantation is very costly. The present invention functions to treat disorders with a therapy that has minimal risk of complications, low cost, and no serious side-effects. The present invention concerns useful therapeutic formulations having a plurality of\n\n\nL-amino acids and non-chiral glycine present in molar ratios also corresponding to either (1) the ratio of the amino constituents in normal tissue or normal organs, or (2) the constituents found in a medicinal compound useful for treating a medical disorder. Furthermore, Applicants have discovered that relatively low amounts of this therapeutic formulation comprised of L-amino acids, such as a daily intake of about 10 grams or less for an adult, are sufficient for therapeutic effect. The invention can be used with many medical disorders, preferably to avert the need for organ transplants, to treat the biological rejection of a transplanted organ, or prophylactically after transplantation before rejection occurs to reduce the risk of organ rejection. In one embodiment, the therapeutic formulations of the invention are administered for pre-operative optimal care where considerations for surgery have not been finalized. In one embodiment, the therapeutic formulation components simulate the chemical components in cyclosporin.\n\n\nElemental feedings containing free amino acids are known as substitutes for milk allergies or milk intolerance, such as in infantile asthma, eczema, or colic. The following articles disclose such uses, all of which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference: Beyond hydrolysates: Use of L-amino acid formula in resistant dietary protein-induced: intestinal disease in infants, Lake, A. M., J. Pediatrics, 131 :658-660 (1997); Intolerance to protein hydrolysate infant formulas: An under-recognized cause of gastrointestinal symptoms in infants, Mack, D. R, Antonson, D. L., Corkins, M. R., Perry, D., and Kruger, R., J. Pediatrics, 131 : 741-744 (1997); Allergy to extensively hydrolyzed cow milk proteins in infants: Identification and treatment with an amino acid-based formula, DeBoissieu, D., Matarazzo, P., and Dupont, C, J. Pediatrics, 131 :741-744 (1997); and Efficacy and safety of hydrolyzed cow milk and amino acid-derived formula in infants with cow milk allergy, Solauri, E., Sutas, Y., Makinen-Kilguncn, S., Oja, S. S., Isosomppi, and R., Turjanmaa, K., J. Pediatrics, 131 : 550-557 (1997). Elemental feedings are also known to be useful for treatment of gastrointestinal conditions, such as Crohn's disease (regional ileitis), as noted in the following article, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference: Treatment of active Crohn's disease by exclusion diet: East Anglian multicentre controlled trial, Riordan, \n\n A. M., Hunter J. O., Cowan, R. E., Crampton, J. R., Davidson, A. R., Dickinson, R. J., Dronfield, M. W., Ellows, I. W., Hishon, and S., Kerrigan, G. N., et al, Lancet, 342 (8880): 1131-34 (Nov. 6, 1993). In the present invention, much smaller dosages of L-amino acids are used than are found in elemental feedings. Furthermore, the inventive compositions contain specific molar ratios of L amino acids for a given disease or to mimic therapy with a given medicament.\n\n\nThe present invention is particularly useful for the medical treatment of congenital biliary atresia, which is the most common cause for pediatric liver transplantation. Congenital biliary atresia has been a fatal disease if not treated surgically with liver transplantation and the Kasai procedure. Past research suggests that congenital biliary atresia is caused by the following: (1) hypersensitivity immunopathy; (2) viral infection—hepatic: and (3) inflammation due to (1) and (2). Eosinophiles present in early stages are suggestive of possible hypersensitivity. In the article entitled Contribution of Hepatic Parenchymal and Nonparenchymal Cells to Hepatic Fibrogenesis in Biliary Atresia, Ramm, Grant A., Nair, Visalini G., Bridle, Kim R., and Shepherd, Ross, W,, American Journal of Pathology, 13(2)L 27-35 (August 1998), which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, it is disclosed that extrahepatic congenital biliary atresia is a severe neonatal liver disease resulting from a sclerosing cholangiopathy of unknown etiology. Although biliary obstruction may be surgically improved by a \"Kasai\" hepatoportoenterostomy, most patients still develop progressive hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Although the source of increased collagen deposition is unclear, an article entitled Prognostic value of serum procollagen III peptide and type IV collagen in patients with congenital biliary atresia, Kobayashi H., Mayano, T., Horikoshi, K., and Tokita A., J. of Ped. Surgery, 33(l):112-4 (January 1998), which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, discloses that progressive hepatic fibrosis, in spite of a successful Kasai procedure, is a major problem in patients with congenital biliary atresia. N-terminal procollagen-III peptide (PIIP) (which is a marker of fibrogenesis, and therefore, of ongoing inflammation), and type IV collagen (found in basement membrane extracellular matrix), were measured in patients with congenital biliary atresia to determine their potential as prognostic markers. Long-term follow-up of patients with congenital biliary atresia successfully treated with hepatic portoenterostomy: The importance of sequential treatment, Lopez-Santamaria M., Gamez M., Marcia J. Diez-Pardo, J., Diaz, M., Leal, N., Lobato R., Martinez, L., Hierro, L., Camarena C, De La Vega A., Frauca E., Jara P., Barrocal, T., Prieto, C. Coretes P., and \n\n Tovar, J., Ped. Surgery International 13(5-6):327 (July 1998), which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, discloses long-term follow-up of patients with congenital biliary atresia who have been treated with hepatic portoenterostomy. As to the importance of sequential treatment, the authors concluded that the natural outcome of extrahepatic biliary atresia is toward fibrosis, and cirrhosis, even in those cases successfully treated with hepatic portoenterostomy (HPE).\n\n\nUrinary 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxochol-4-en-24-oic and 3-oxochola-4,6-dien-24-oic acids in infants with cholestasis, Kimura, A., Suzuki, M., Murai, T., Kurosawa, T., Tomna, M., Sata M., Inoue, T., Hoshiyama, A., Nakashima E., Yamashita, Y, Fujisawa, T., and Kate, H., J. of Hepatology, 28(2):270-9 (February 1998), which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, discloses that urinary 3-oxo-delta4 bile acids have been detected in infants who ultimately died of liver disease. The results reported in this article suggest that an increase in the 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxochol-4-en-24-oic acid and 3-oxochola-4,6-dien-24-oic acid in the urine of patients with hepatobiliary disease indicates a poor prognosis. The first cooperative living-related donor liver transplantation performed by two separate institution teams: The Kanaqawa Liver Transplantation Program, Ohhama, Y., Shinkai, M., Fujita, S., Nishi, T., Yamamoto, H., Torigai, K., Takemiya, S., Sugimasa, Y., Akaike, M., and Tanabe, H., Surgery Today, 28(2): 173-7 (1998), which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, is a study of living-related donor liver transplantations. The study involves five children with congenital biliary atresia who were given partial liver grafts obtained from their mothers in January, 1995.\n\n\nPortal vein reconstruction in pediatric liver transplantation from living donors, Saad, S., Tanaka, K., Inomata, Y., Uamoto, S., Ozaki, N., Okajima, H., Egawa, H., and Yamacka, Y., Annals of Surgery, 227(2):275-81 (February 1998), which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, discloses that in living related partial liver transplantations, portal vein anastomosis to the confluence, with or without the use of vein grafts, is an optional alternative to end-to-end reconstruction, especially in small children.\n\n\nSoluble ICAM-l (Sicam-1) in congenital biliary atresia, Minnick, K. E., Kreisberg, R., and Dillon, P. W., J. of Surgical Research, 76(1), 53-6 (April 1998), which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, discloses that SICAM-1 (Soluble Intercellular Adhesion Molecule- 1) is markedly elevated in congenital biliary atresia, reflecting the immunopathology of the disease process, but it does not appear to correlate with markers of \n\n liver function. SICAM-I may be useful in assessing the effects of immunomodulatory therapy.\n\n\nDiverse morphology of biliary atresia in an animal model, Petersen, C, Grasshoff, S., and Luciano, L. Journal of Hepatology, 28(4): 603-7 (April 1998), which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, discloses diverse morphology of congenital biliary atresia in an animal model and relates the findings to congenital biliary atresia in children. Extrahepatic congenital biliary atresia can be simulated in Balb/c-mice which have been infected with a rotavirus. Irreversible occlusion of the common bile duct is the result of an inflammatory process of the whole biliary tract. The observations in this animal model are analogous to observations of extrahepatic congenital biliary atresia in newborn children. This original model can be used to help determine the minimal therapeutic dose required of the present invention per animal weight of this nutrient therapy (similar concept to toxicologic studies for minimal lethal dosage). These studies suggest that most types of extrahepatic congenital biliary atresia in children can be mimicked in an animal model. Neurodevelopment outcome of young children with extra hepatic congenital biliary atresia 1 year after liver transplantation, Wayman, K. L, Cox, K. L., and Esquivel, C. O., Journal of Pediatrics, 131(6):894-8 (December 1997), which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, stresses that urgent nutritional therapy is a preventive measure for development delay. A case series of transplant recipients who despite immuno suppression developed inflammatory bowel disease, Riley, T. R., Schoen, R. E., Lee, R. G., and Rakela, J., American J. of Gastroenterology, 92(2):279-82 (February 1997), which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, discloses a small number of patients who developed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's Disease, after solid organ transplantation, one of which had pre-transplantation diagnosis of congenital biliary atresia, despite use of immunosuppressive therapy.\n\n\nCongenital biliary atresia is similar to infantile asthma; the asthma and associated inflammation and edema occur in the tracheo-bronchial tree, whereas in congenital biliary atresia, the shock organ and associated inflammation and edema occur in the biliary tree. In a preferred embodiment, the method and composition of the present invention treats congenital biliary atresia without resulting in cirrhosis or inflammatory bowel disease, two common ailments suffered by children having received conventional therapy for congenital biliary atresia. \n\n The first in-vitro studies have been provided by providing the pharmacologic mechanisms of significantly reducing the inflammatory cytokine chemo-attractant, mediators, as well as providing anti-inflammatory interleukin receptor antagonists by incubating Crohn's diseased tissue and normal bowel biopsy tissue as a control. Measuring reduction in interleukin levels of inflammation (ILl) as well as the antagonists of inflammation (ILl receptor inflammatory antagonists) was performed by two institution teams: Shand, Marian, Meister, Doris, et al, Direct Anti-inflammatory Effect of Elemental Diet on Crohn 's Tissue in- Vitro. Gl Laboratory, Dept of Medical Sciences, Univ. of Edinburgh Western General Hospital, Edinburgh.2000; and Meister, D et al. Anti-inflammatory Effects of Enteral diet Components on Crohn 's Disease-affected Tissues in Vitro. 2002. UK. Which is here by incorporated here-in in its entirety by reference. This correlates with our findings presented in the series of filed patents, following 6, 974,796 Bl, where in the analog biologic structure of the amino acids to their respective propionic acid, butyric acid and three aromatic amino acids with many of the existing anti-inflammatory bio-chemicals such as ibuprofen are presented in detail in section (3a.), Uses and Pharmacologic Mechanisms of Antiinflammatory Activity.\n\n\nThe multiplicity of affects of these components of therapeutic subject composition, such as amino acids, are further included in functioning not only in stimulating protein synthesis, but also in providing neurotransmitter activity. Certain amino acids are central neurotransmitters, especially, GABA (gamma amino butyric acid), glycine and glutamate. Dicarboxylic amino acids, such as glutamate have neuro-excitatory effects and the monocarboxylic amino acids such as GABA, glycine, B-alanine (beta alanine) and taurine, produce inhibition. Similar multiplicity of bio-chemical effects are seen with current medication in the PDR. Some are specific effects and some are unwanted side-effects. These components may be utilized for their beneficial effect without the trade-off of the multiplicity of side-effects in medication such as corticosteroids. Along with their neurotransmitter effects, these amino acids have a specific effect of tissue healing and repairing of cell, tissue and cell membrane defect. Also, these amino acids such as aromatic amino acids, tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine act as a source of such neurotransmitters as serotonin epinephrine, non-epinephrine DOPA (di- hydroxyphenalenone).\n\n\nPresented by Goodman & Gilman's Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics.

Nutritional Status, Pressure Sores & Mortality in Elderly Patients. 1996. University of Nebraska Medical Center, College of Nursing, Omaha (17/20 patient care studies) hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference discloses decubitus ulcer (the \"Christopher Reeves\" syndrome) pressure sores related to protein deficiencies in the wound healing of decubitus ulcers in elderly nursing home patients with and without cancer predisposition. They found that 28 cancer patients had developed pressure sores versus 23 non cancer patients. 23 out of 33 patients developed Kwashiorkor (significant blood albumen protein deficiency) versus 6 out of 33 patients that had developed Kwashiorkor. In 12 weeks, 12 out of 28 (almost ½) of the cancer patients died versus the 4 out of 23 (1/6) of the nocancer patients that died.\n\n\nSubject inventive immunotherapeutics is defined as an immunologic broad based and diverse range of therapeutic applications. The treatment of disease and damaged tissue from a fresh tissue healing vantage point. This molecular medicine replication of human tissue and the underlying molecular embryology of the most advanced principles of proteomics applied to immunotherapeutics would be those of the subject application. As a result, this therapeutics is immunologically privileged and adapts well to crossing the multiplicity of species barriers as well as disease cell lines. The use of advanced proteomics in protoplasmic protein advanced healing in conjunction with redirecting and noπnalizing the persistent and aggressive immuno-inflammatory response system, resulting in a significant increase in anti- inflammatory receptor antagonists along with equivalent decrease of inflammatory protein interleukins (cytokines). This FDA approved therapeutics is a steroid sparing/ substitute applicable as a stem cell stimulant growth factor to the many disease systems of the body such as, but not limited to, wound healing inclusive of deep penetrating wounds, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), bronchial asthma, neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis (MS), cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis.\n\n\nThe immunotherapeutic agent (IA) of the subject invention is able to provide the body tissues with the repair components required for disease resolution, even in diseases of poor prognosis. This includes healing of damaged tissue due to injuries. The IA of the subject invention can activate the patient's own healing system and associated stem cells that have been deactivated by disease or trauma. The subject IA, FDA approved bio-material composition, provides repair and regeneration of diseased tissue resulting in disease resolution. Healing is the paramount mechanism unique and exciting to this therapeutics to \n\n overlap and provide normalized cell cycle protein synthesis of healing anti-inflammation of healing and steroid sparing/substitution of IA' s healing capacity.\n\n\nThe subject immunotherapeutics can be directed to the following markets focused upon trauma and its potential complications of persistent tissue damage and inflammation. Traumas presented in the ER and the surgical suite, also evident in sport medicine and arthritis, have a total current published market estimates of approximately $650 Billion. Trauma: $260 Billion, Sports Medicine: S133 Billion, Arthritis: $128 Billion and Infectious Disease: $120 Billion. (Sources of comparative relative market value include Wikipedia, Women's Health Resource and Investor's Business Daily) is subject of further extensive study. Similar findings have been noted in the arthritic care (included in arthritic diseases of poor prognosis) estimated annual U.S. costs and market value for animal veterinarian care of about $20 billion total comprising $10 billion veterinarian care and $9.8 billion for supplies and over-the-counter medicine.\n\n\nAnimal studies including equine veterinarian studies this also provides a methodology for drug discovery by co-using in the therapeutics of an existing veterinary disease, At the same time this represents a methodology for drug discovery, not limited to disease presented and treated here, in animal testing useing an existing analog disease model such as, but not limited to, sports medicine. This was accomplished without experimentally producing a diseased model in an animal, representing an ethical and humane advance in drug discovery as well as a significant economic advantage in greatly minimizing the costs that are escalating in drug development by accomplishing three beneficial therapeutic effects at the same time that further includes a secondary market, veterinary medicine.\n\n\nIt is believed this inventive subject composition immunotherapeutics provides the activation of protein synthesis and proteomics, an essential component of healing, associated proteomics of protein polymerases of DNA and RNA, and the patient's own stem cells non- invasively. The anti-inflammatory immunotherapeutic efficacy is associated with reduction in release of inflammatory cytokines and chemo-attractants as well as an increase in the biochemical antagonist to protein interleukin inflammatory receptors associated antiinflammatory efficacy. This subject composition therapeutics thereby provides a therapy for the elderly confined to nursing homes with the therapeutic opportunity of preventing and reversing the very serious complication of decubitus pressure sores.\n\n\nThe 3-D stereochemistry of therapeutic compounds as amino acids without side effect and basis for stimulation of protein synthesis essential for healing and wound healing \n\n associated with alpha amino carbon and tetrahedral fit, the L amino acids and non-chiral glycine specified by the genetic code of protein and therapeutically targeted protein including anti-inflammatory efficacy by 3-D fit into protein and its synthesis including aromatic benzene ring containing amino acids such as L tyrosine L phenylalanine L tryptophan. In contrast to the 3-D sliding effect of one benzene ring upon the other as the case with aromatic benzene ring NSAID compounds is believed to explain the aromatic benzene ring containing NSAID non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 3-D stereo chemical interference with protein synthesis and healing. This concurs with 20 recent studies: recommending avoidance of NSAID wound healing further evidence for this benzene ring misfit in the stereochemistry of therapeutics as applied to drug efficacy and safety and maximizing and optimizing efficacy and safety in new drug discovery.\n\n\nThis 3-D stereo chemical misfit can be further conceptualized in terms of the resulting from this misfit in the form of metabolic intolerance that we have progressively discovered in regard to trans fatty acid fats a product of hydrogenation design based on 2-D chemistry. As a result, this clinical medicine 3-D stearic stereo chemical misfit, acting as a biochemical molecular foreign body, was originally mandated to be removed from the marketplace by the country of Denmark. Denmark makes great strides in food chemistry and through their leadership, has been taken off the market throughout the world. The 3-D stereo fit provides added knowledge in tracking the potential of a 3-D integrative misfit in the case of drag reactions and intolerances. The L amino acid, levo dopa (L tyrosine with an extra adjacent hydroxyl group), can traverse the blood brain barrier. In the management of Parkinsonism, however, when decarboxylated into its active neurotransmitter amine form, it has not been found useful therapeutically. This is because it cannot cross nor have a stereo 3-D fit to traverse the blood brain barrier as required in this treatment. This example further illustrates the remarkable, flexible, adaptable fit, found in this subject composition therapeutics: the L amino acids and glycine specified by the genetic code of targeted protein essential component in contrast to the amine, a product of simply removing the carboxyl group of the amino acid.\n\n\nIn enhancing therapeutics through cell biology models, we find we are imaging cell and tissue surface and a biologic model of conceptualization and visualize a cell tissue 3-D stereochemistry as a micro-cosmonaut. This will help to best conceptualize the above 3-D stereochemistry necessary to advance this subject composition therapeutics, advancing new drug or food component discovery, to enhance enzymatic metabolic homeostatic equilibrium. \n\n Clinically integrated cell biology further provides important second messenger final pathway of pharmacologic signaling of cell biology in mediating this therapeutics. This therapeutics also provides normalization of neurotransmitter signaling applicable neurological Iy. Preclinical findings also provide for this anabolic remyelination therapeutic opportunity.\n\n\nThe importance of correcting deficiencies associated with disease, are being stressed here. These are deficiencies found in the UK of children with Crohn's disease, which composition U.S. Patent Mo. 6,974,796 Bl (hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety)addresses. In fact, wound healing the process of which has been well-studied is based on replication of human or other mammalian tissue biochemically. This has been found to also replicate the molecular medicine of the healing system stem cell and molecular embryology. This can be summarized by the activation of the phosphatidyl choline, phospholipid of the cell membrane of the egg by sperm penetration fertilization, which in 3-5 minutes has been shown by, experimentally radioactively tagged amino acids to activate the metabolically sleeping egg and initiate the incorporation of these existing free amino acids into protein. Similarly utilized in this inventive therapeutics inclusive of twenty free amino acids specified by the genetic code of template protein and cell membrane essence phospholipid such as phosphatidyl choline. Within 1 -2 hours the extracellular matrix (ECM) links the cleaved cells together. This is similarly utilized in this inventive therapeutics to impart a glycosylated tissue tracking biomarker along with a highly sulfated ECM analogist biochemically, eg. to the sulfated nylon polymer of bullet proof vest material of Kevlar. This has been shown by Prudden (Prudden JF, Allen J. The Clinical Acceleration of Healing with a Cartilage Preparation. JAMA. 1965; 192 (5): 352-356) to increase the tensile strength of healing tissue by 42%. This is synergized by the micronutrients such as, but not limited to, the coenzyme activity, and in the case of vitamin D now believed to be hormone-like antioxidant activities of the vitamins similar actions of the minerals including catalytic activity.\n\n\nThe normalization of the mitochondria tissue energy pack from an evolutionary stand point is believed to be derived from micro-organisms, (see J.Brachet & H.Alexandre, Introduction to Molecular Embryology, Springer- Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, 1986 pg.18, which is incorporated herein in its entirety) The normalization of the mitochondria is of practical therapeutic use as we have shown, in that with the use of phospholipid, specifically egg yolk phospholipid, normalization of the patient's energy level in end-stage cancer \n\n (available by Abbott Laboratories as Liposyn as well as a similar FDA approved product Intralipid made by Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL). This is in conjunction with existing therapy whereby patients within 24-48 hours felt that their energy level was normal and they were able to go home rather than going to hospice or remain in the hospital. This correlates with microbiologist, Warburg's studies presented at his Nobel prize presentation, in that the metabolism of mitochondria of the human cancer cells had reverted to the metabolism of the micro-organism at 10% of the aerobic energy level of normal human tissue. (Leonard S. Girsh, M.D., Lipid Containing Compositions and Methods of Using Them, US patent 2007/0037777 Al, Feb.15, 2007 (in-vivo studies) The comparison of the more efficient aerobic energy release of human and other mammalian tissue, (see Piel, Gerard. The Age of Science. Basic Books 2001 New York, NY. Pages 285-286, which is incorporated herein in its entirety),) repair and tissue regeneration, which are dependent upon not only correcting and adding an adequate supply of these components, but all the components of 6,974,796 Bl. These include amino acids, vitamins, minerals, of the elemental feedings and specific profiles of targeted tissue protein along with extracellular matrix. In fact diseases have been reported to be diagnosable by deficiency biomarker patterns. This is exemplified by neurodegenerative diseases such as MS. Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's associated with the unique reduction of uric acid deficiency biomarker.\n\n\nThis therapeutic subject composition foπnulations, in mimicking human tissue, incorporates therapeutically and simultaneously offers the bio-environment component correction of deficiencies. It has been found to successfully resolve diseases of poor or guarded prognosis such as, but not limited to, diseases requiring organ transplants, joint prosthesis, skin grafts, Crohn's disease, and more recently, cancer. This includes ectodermal healing as applied in wound healing. (Pediatric Surgical Care) These bio-chemicals are used to not only replicate human tissue and other mammalian tissue with their healing capacity, but also incorporated bio-robotically, to aid damaged tissue in its function as normal tissue, as well as to activate and mobilize stem cells. This stem cell stimulant growth factor and its bio-robotics can best be illustrated by self vesiculation of phospholipid such as phosphatidyl choline in cell, nuclear, and organelle membrane formations. The final composition-of-matter, when used transdermal^, orally, or intravenously, can also activate patient's tissue synergistically. thereby, facilitating, accelerating and stimulating, therapeutics to most importantly function as an equivalent therapy to cell-based therapeutics provided as healing stem cell tracking biomarkers. \n\n Once tissues have been activated, understanding and even directing the mechanisms that effect such tissue normalization and healing can be facilitated by the use of polarizing light microscopy. Inclusive of best visualization of in-vitro fertilization and meiotic spindle formulation with the diagnostic and therapeutic tracking as measured by degree of birefringence is evidence of membrane phospholipid adequacy of the meiotic spindle.\n\n\nIt is further believed in mitosis and more so abnormal mitosis of cancer wherein (1) absent nuclear membrane, (2) nucleolar membrane and nucleolus and (3) DNA chromatin condensation, too dense to function as templating agent. This is associated with deficiency shortage of phospholipid, such as phosphatidyl choline necessary for normal spindle formation and preventable histopathologic finding of characteristic cell of cancer of being \"stuck\" in mitotic division such as anaphase. It is believed detectable that this phospholipid deficiency is detectable as deficient by inventive subject instrumentation polarizing microscopy readout. (Further described with therapeutic application of addressing and normalizing hydrophilic phosphatidyl choline deficiency Leonard S. Girsh, M.D., Lipid Containing Compositions and Methods of Using Them., US patent 2007/0037777 Al , Feb.15, 2007 (in-vivo studies) and Leonard S. Girsh .M. D., Therapeutic Composition for Treatment of a Damaged Tissue, US patent 2005/6, 974, 796 Bl Dec.13, 05)\n\n\nThis further confirmation of phospholipid deficiency in cancer has been further traceable and tracked diagnostically in patients receiving elemental feedings: amino acids, micronutrient vitamins and minerals without the addition of phospholipid such as phosphatidyl choline, leading to hepatic precancerous preneoplastic mutagenicity. These findings have been found to be readily reversible in humans with phospholipid replacement. In an animal experiment rats fed a choline deficient diet, foci preneoplastic hepatocytes appear in the rat liver, and hepatocellular carcinomas occur at approximately 12 months. The multiplicity of functionality in addition to acting as a hydrophilic moiety as a hydrophilic surfactant phospholipid, phosphatidyl choline; choline being a trimethylamine has methylating capacity similar to B 12, folic acid, B6, B2, riboflavin along with the methylating capacity of trimethylglycine. These compounds and methylating capacity thereby have the ability to reverse a deficiency like condition of homocysteine acting as a pathogen rather than the normal amino acid that it was derived from. Thereby, rendering pathogenic homocysteine reversibly to an essential amino acid methionine as well as a sulfur containing amino acid cysteine. (B. F. Szuhaj,and S.H. Zeisel, \"Choline, Phospholipids, Health, and Disease\n'\n\" SOCS Press, page 21 & 22 along with cited references 86-98) \n\n Another deficiency that we have tracked provides disease reversibility: this dual opportunity for two sites to heal the (1) wound and (2) chronic Crohn's disease by a dual method of administration; transdermal and systemic oral subject composition treatments were used here and have been cited in detail. The poor healing qualities of the tissues and organ systems of the body inflammatory bowel disease can be reflected visualized focused on the open wound and its associated loss of extracellular matrix tensile strength that determines not only its ability to resist trauma but also its ability to heal through this therapeutics is aimed to correct. This healing system can be therapeutically directed when the disease was focused on the trauma and poor healing qualities of the skin secondary to the interference of healing by steroids and by the intensity, aggressiveness and persistence of the immuno inflammatory system production of inflammatory interleukin and cytokine protein chemicals (for pediatric and adult IBD). Prolonged use of steroids for the management of Crohn's Disease represented the rationale for the inability of this wound to heal. This prompted the plastic surgeon, in our discussion, to defer a full thickness skin graft which would have resulted in two major wounds unable to heal, the patient's graft donor site, and her own graft site, in this case. Thus, the subject composition's steroid sparing had two significant therapeutic benefits, accelerating wound healing and averted a full thickness graft (with the association of two wounds that would be at-risk of healing). Additionally, the subject composition's wound healing therapeutics maximizes and optimizes wound healing response, thereby providing the epitome of wound healing resulting in a scar-free healed wound. This emphasizes drug efficacy and safety in tissue repair, regeneration, and revitalizing tissue to heal through the subject compositions immunotherapeutic agent (IA) regenerative medicine.\n\n\nIn conclusion: This includes the ability to provide tissue tensile strength, resilience, and thereby the ability to best resist trauma of importance in sports medicine and even of more important of everyday living. This immunologically privileged therapeutics provides anabolic healing and disease resolution, while simultaneously providing biologic competition which provides both tissue antagonism and resistance against invasive micro-organisms. This therapeutics also provides protective effect to resist other etiological factors such as carcinogens. In 2001, the inventor accompanied this patient to the plastic surgeon, the surgeon stated \"it looks as if you were hit with an ax.\" This wound was sustained secondary to spiking herself with the heel of one shoe against the other leg, (similar to the spiking injuries seen in sports medicine such as a baseball player sliding into second base). Upon inspection \n\n of the wound it appeared as if her tissues fell apart, secondary to deficiencies, resulting from aggressive, persistent inflammatory chemical protein interleukins released by immunocytes due to prolonged Crohn's disease further clarifying the plastic surgeon's description. A significant component of these deficiencies is associated with gastrointestinal flare-ups of diarrhea every one to two months of more than 3-6 diarrheal explosive bowel movements per day, representative of significant tissue and tissue fluid loss with resultant deficiencies requiring large daily dosages of steroids, as much as 4-6 tablets (4mg each of Aristocort, Lederle then Fujisawa) which furthered the deficiency interference with healing. Dosage of steroid were progressively reduced: every one to two day by one tablet and then maintenance of one to two tablets daily. Additionally, work of Sanderson shows that elemental feedings reduced abnoπnal intestinal permeability with associated hourly and daily tissue fluid loss contributing even further to the deficiency state as seen with this wound. This preventive therapy provided: (1) functional and gross structural revelation of the equivalent of tissue inadequacy, in that the tissue fell apart. This deficiency of tissue loss, as sited above, to withstand and resist the trauma of the inflicted wound further provided the development of IBD, Crohn's disease therapeutics as well as countering the deficiency. Of this subject composition therapeutics, the extracellular matrix (ECM) would be the most significant (but not limited to) deficiency in that the tensile strength of tissue does not have the ability to maintain the 42% tensile strength to hold the tissues together. This is analog to the molecular embryology stem cell's healing capacity representing the ECM in uniting cells after cleavage. The experimental molecular embryology in sea life of the sponge embryo falling apart after cleavage is the cell biology analog to the above wound. This occurs when, experimentally, a millipore filter removes the ECM, only to be reformed in two hours so that the cells can reunite. This patient is no longer prone to wounds that fail to heal nor to a bowel that fails to heal. Since recovery she has been impressed with the necessity to maintain therapeutics of GIR 1 14P and requires 3 ½ tablets of steroids weekly without flare-ups formerly requiring the foregoing extensive dosages of steroids. In the past year she is receiving 2 ½ tablets of steroids, (see Figure 10.B) The importance of the ECM for multi-cellular tissue formation is emphasized here by the production of collagen, laminin and fibronectin as early as cleavage of the fertilized egg and represents the integrated essence of tissue. This tissue union is not an inert glue. The ECM contains software-like information which can direct organization of cells attachment differentiation and intracellular and intra-tissue signaling. This synergistic \n\n final link of ECM of cells integrated into tissue is important not only for wound healing but growth and development.\n\n\nAlthough not often utilized, and often undervalued as an investigative tool, polarized light microscopy can provide the benefits of bright-field microscopy, in addition to a variety of other information, which is simply not available with any other optical microscopy technique.\n\n\nThis procedure can also provide information on absorption, color and boundaries between materials and tissues of differing refractive indices obtainable in brightfield microscopy, polarized light microscopy can distinguish between isotropic and anisotropic materials. By exploiting the optical properties of anisotropy, detailed information, as is believed non- invasively, about the living cell and tissue not requiring stains. Structure and composition of materials can be obtained, which can be invaluable for identification and diagnostic purposes\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a composition and uses thereof for treatment of damaged tissue, comprising at least one essential amino acid in L form and at least one essential lipid; wherein the composition is administered to a mammal suffering from severe tissue damage. The invention further relates to a composition and uses thereof comprising a mixture of one or more free L-amino acids in which the molar ratio of the free L-amino acids and non chiral glycine, correspond to the molar ratio of amino components, as specified by the genetic code, in a mammalian tissue protein; and at least one essential lipid.\n\n\nThe invention also relates to a composition comprising a mixture of one or more free L-amino acids and at least one essential lipid; wherein the molar ratio of the free L-amino acids corresponds approximately to the molar ratio of amino components in a medicament, particularly a cyclosporin or penicillin. For example, the activity of cyclosporin or penicillin can be mimicked by administration of a therapeutic formulation having components that could be combined to create a ring, linkage, or other moiety that mimics a lactam ring. More particularly, it mimics the CO-N bond of the beta-lactam ring, which is believed essential to the therapeutic activity of penicillin and cyclosporin. Furthermore, the inventive therapeutic formulations avoid microorganism metabolites and proteins such as those having D-alanine, and D alanyl groups as are present in penicillin. It is believed that by providing the amino acid stereoisomers, native to the mammalian body— namely. L amino acids, and non-chiral \n\n glycine and L phospholipids such as phosphatidyl choline in optically pure form, regeneration of damaged tissue is enhanced.\n\n\nComposition therapeutics also comprises a plurality of amino acids having a molar ratio which is characteristic of human bowel protein and further comprises a fatty acid, gamma-amino butyric acid or L-carnitine. Using FDA-pre-approved-as-safe components equivalent to the components of human tissue, composition therapeutics is immunologically concordant with genetic 'self and the immuno-inflammatory barrier and thereby avoids crossing and activating the immuno-inflammatory barrier.\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to immuno therapeutic compositions and uses thereof, for diseases of poor or guarded prognosis. Composition therapeutics mimics mammalian and human tissue, and immunologic 'self. As micronutrient microenvironment immunologic 'self, it is thereby bio-chemically invisible and does not activate the inflammatory cytokine chemo-attractant system. These therapeutics are immunologically privileged and therefore can cross animal and plant barriers and disease cell line. The subject therapeutic component precursors provide healing, repair and regeneration systems. This immunotherapeutics activates synthesis of protein, an essential component of anabolic characteristic of anabolic healing, associated protein polymerases of DNA and RNA, and the patient's own stem cells non-invasively. The anti-inflammatory immunotherapeutic anti- catabolic efficacy is associated with reduction in release of inflammatory cytokines and chemo-attractants. It also increases the bio-chemical antagonist to interleukin inflammatory receptors associated with anti-inflammatory anti-catabolic efficacy. This results in averting the need for organ and skin transplantation. The anti-inflammatory an ti -arthritic tissue healing, repair and regeneration efficacy can avert the need for joint replacement prostheses, along with having in-vitro and in-vivo anti-cancer efficacy. Cell and tissue ordered repair and regenerative healing are provided with the use of these 3-D stereo-chemical organizational matrices' integrative fits. Thereby a therapeutic reversal is provided for damaged tissue, and the disorder and entropy of disease. This bimolecular epigenetic and genetic activation of the patient's own stem cells in cell/tissue healing immuno-therapeutics reverses a newly discovered biomolecular component of diseases of poor or guarded prognosis.\n\n\nOnce tissues have been activated, understanding and even directing the mechanisms that effect such tissue normalization and healing can be facilitated by the use of polarizing light microscopy. \n\n Isotropic materials, such as gases, liquids, unstressed glasses and cubic crystals, demonstrate a homogenous composition having the same optical properties in all directions. They have only one refractive index and no restriction on the vibration direction of light passing through them. In contrast, anisotropic materials, which constitute approximately 90 percent of all solid substances, particularly if the polar surface activity is hydrophilic as our tissue which corresponds to this inventive tissue replication, having optical properties that vary with the orientation of incident light with the crystallographic axes. They can demonstrate a range of refractive indices depending both on the propagation direction of light through the substance and on the vibrational plane coordinates. More importantly, anisotropic materials act as light beam splitters, in that they divide light rays into two parts (as shown, for example, in Figure 15). The technique of polarizing microscopy exploits the interference of the split light rays, as they are re-united along the same optical path to extract information about materials, including living tissue.\n\n\nAlthough not often utilized and often undervalued as an investigative tool, polarized light microscopy can provide the benefits of brightfield microscopy, in addition to a variety of other information, which is simply not available with any other optical microscopy technique. As well as providing information on absorption color and boundaries between materials and tissues of differing refractive indices obtainable in brightfield microscopy, vital living tissue not dependent upon stain, polarized light microscopy can distinguish between isotropic and anisotropic materials. By exploiting the optical properties of anisotropy, the subject invention utilizes the detailed information obtained about the structure and composition of materials for identification and diagnostic purposes.\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic drawing of a liver illustrating the locus of congenital biliary atresia disease being close to the location of stem cells and in approximately the area of believed therapeutic activity. Biliary atresia is evidenced by a sheet of periductular inflammation and fibrosis. Also shown on this H&E slide, is extensive periductule inflammation. This inflammatory obstruction also prevents re-anastomosis of the biliary ductules, diagrammatically illustrated here by superimposing the histopathology of biliary atresia upon the normal microscopic anatomy of the liver.\n\n\nFIG. 2 is a schematic diagram showing Bio-environment of natural healing and the essential component of the anti-inflammatory process \n\n FIG. 3 illustrates the typical tetrahedron structure of L alpha amino acids and glycine molecules. In consideration of the surface phenomenon in this therapeutic regime the L amino acid and glycine intermolecular tetrahedron provides a 3D surface fit in protein synthesis in tissue and organ healing. In contrast, the benzene ring compounds, from which many medications are derived, do not share this fit (in contrast, a 3D planar gliding action is present) in protein synthesis and actually interferes with protein synthesis.\n\n\nFIG. 4 illustrates the protein synthesis matrix and amino acid HLB hydrophiliciy depend protein folding basis of bioactivity for compact disc software mediated by amino acid magnet-like dipole. FIG. 5 is a schematic showing the cell biology of F.A.S.T.™ and synergistic bio- environmental components.\n\n\nFIG. 6 Mitotic apparatus isolated from cleaving sea animal eggs (sea urchin) FIG. 7A is a table showing two examples of amino acid hydrophobicity scales. The varying of the structured function with the biologic composition is dependent upon the genomically templated precise protein amino acid position and structure of this polymer chain of amino acid analog to a string of pearls. Additionally, the dipole magnet-like amino acid has relative forces that determine the ultimate 3D structure of tertiary and secondary proteins. For example this 3D fit explains the enzyme and it's fit with a substrate (fig.8). This also explains the antibody product of the immune system and its antigen fit. Any change, such as extreme heat or cold, has the ability to change or denature the natural 3D biologic structural conformation and therefore the 3D biologic fit and function and hydrophilicity is disrupted. For example, the hydrophilic free amino acid lysine has a 99 -100% anticancer activity as measured in-vitro. Lysine is found to be highly hydrophilic and therefore, as we have found, highly anti-carcinogenic, as seen on the relative hydrophilicity chart of amino acid specified by the genetic code of human protoplasmic tissue protein a di-amino free amino acid. In the most excitatory dicarboxylic amino acids, glutamate and aspartate they have extremely powerful excitatory effects on neurons in every region of the central nervous system as central neural transmitters and are of potential significant value in neurologic care. Gabaglycine, beta alanine and taurine are neuro-inhibitors and omega amino acids. Glycine is the most abundant amino acid with inhibitory activity found in the ventral-quadrant gray matter of the spinal cord. Glycine is of therapeutic importance in spinal cord injuries and it must be stressed that the glycine deficiency drop is proportionate to degeneration of the ventral -quadrant of the spinal cord in neurologic care of the Christopher Reeve's syndrome of \n\n traumatic quadriplegia. The therapeutic titration of glycine to achieve normal levels as a component of this therapeutic composition as well as a titratable tracked deficiency biomarker is an opportunity for enhancing management of spinal cord injury, (a disease of poor prognosis to which our therapeutics is targeted), as a component of inventive therapeutics.\n\n\nFIG. 7B is an illustration of the biologic activity of a protein enzyme which is dependent on secondary and tertiary folding associated with hydrophilicity HLB.\n\n\nFIG. 8 illustrates an example of how the BPTI molecule (top) fits snuggly onto the surface of the trypsin molecule (bottom), blocking the active site of trypsin.

Therapeutic Formulations\n\n\nThe present invention involves administering to a mammal a therapeutic foπnulation comprising a mixture of at least one free L-amino acid, including at least one free essential amino acid in L stereoisomer form; and one or more essential lipids. Preferably, the L-amino acid profile simulates (1 ) the amino acid components of the proteins normally present in healthy tissue that is now diseased or is a transplanted tissue; or (2) the amino acid components of a medicament, preferably a medicament that is a polypeptide, peptide, protein, or analog of any of these.\n\n\nLamino acids are used in the invention because this stereoisomer is what the mammalian body naturally makes and uses. Preferably, the therapeutic formulations of the invention contains L amino acids in optically pure form. Optically pure, is herein defined as having at least 90% by weight of one stereoisomer and 10% by weight or less of one or more other stereoisomers. Preferably the L amino acids are at least 95% by weight of the L isomer and 5% by weight or less of the D isomer, and most preferably over 99% by weight of the L \n\n isomer and 1% or less by weight of the D isomer. Optically pure L amino acids are commercially available and also are readily obtainable by methods known to those of skill in the art, for example, by synthesis from an optically pure intermediate.\n\n\nEssential amino acids are defined as the amino acids that must be supplied in the diet because the organism cannot synthesize sufficient quantities of them. Essential amino acids for adult humans are arginine, histidine. isoleucine. leucine, lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Essential amino acids for other groups of patients are known to those of skill in the art. Free amino acids as used herein mean amino acids that are not part of a peptide or a protein. Free amino acids may be in acid or salt form. Essential lipids are defined as the lipids that must be supplied in the diet because the organism cannot synthesize sufficient quantities of them. For mammals, the essential lipids include linoleic, and linolenic acids. The essential lipids are preferably obtained from flaxseed, soy, safflower or sesame oils.\n\n\nAnalog is defined as a chemical component with a structure similar to another but differing from it in respect to a certain component. An analog may have a similar or opposite action metabolically.\n\n\nOne preferred therapeutic composition comprises one or more free essential amino acids in L form, one or more essential lipids, one or more protective antioxidant lipids (such as EPA), and one or more mucopolysaccharides, such as chondroitin sulfate. Another preferred therapeutic composition comprises one or more free essential amino acids in L form, one or more essential lipids, one or more protective antioxidant lipids (such as EPA), one or more phospholipids, and one or more glycolipids. Yet a more preferred embodiment further comprises lipoproteins.\n\n\nOptionally, the therapeutic formulation may further comprise one or more simple sugars (e.g., monosaccharides or disaccharides). such as glucose or fructose; one or more nonessential fats or lipids such as triglyceride fats, mono- and diglycerides, phospholipids such as phosphatidyl choline and phosphatidyl serine, glycolipids, and lipoproteins; vitamins; minerals; amino acid-like components such as taurine and carnitine; and choline. Preferably, at least one fish oil derived fatty acid lipid or fat, such as EPA (cicosopentanoic acid), and at least one short or medium chain fatty acid lipid or fat (as a source of quick energy rather than fat storage), is also present.\n\n\nOptionally, at least one mucopolysaccharide such as shark cartilage, chondroitin sulfate, collagen, cartilage, hyaluronic acid and hyaluronan mucopolysaccharide is also \n\n present in the therapeutic formulation. The mucopolysaccharide is believed to stimulate the immune system and to have anti-nco-inflammatory and anti-neoangiogenesis activity.\n\n\nPreferably, the therapeutic compositions comprise amino acids in ratios that correspond generally to the ratios of amino acid components in healthy tissue, embryonic cells, or a medicament.\n\n\nFor example, damaged skin, such as that caused by scurvy, atopic dermatosis, psoriasis, or pemphigus, can be treated by a therapeutic formulation that mimics the amino acid components of healthy skin protein. One example of such a therapeutic formulation is as follows: 3 moles L methionine, 16 moles L proline, 13 moles L tyrosine, 30 moles L asparagine, 8 moles L phenylalanine, 20 moles L cysteine, 50 moles L leucine, 38 moles L serine, 29 moles L arginine, 21 moles L threonine, 21 moles L valine, 3 moles L histidine, 9 moles glycine, 22 moles L alanine, 14 moles L isoleucine, 2 moles L tryptophan, 46 moles L glutamic acid, 12 moles L lysine, 14 moles L aspartic acid, and 32 moles of L glutamine. The molar ratios may vary about 50%, and more preferably about 10%, and still provide the inventive therapy. For example, the 2 moles of L tryptophan in the above foπnula may be considered 2 plus or minus 1 mole L tryptophan and, more preferably, 2 plus or minus 0.2 mole L tryptophan. To treat scurvy, the above formulation would be administered cither orally or topically in combination with 500 to 1000 milligram ascorbic acid daily. Scurvy is known to result in skin at the edge of wounds that has an almost complete absence of the 3 and 4 hydroxy proline of hydroxylated L proline amino acids normally present as 16 of the 404 moles in the amino acid components of skin protein. It is believed that the formulation of the invention will work by providing a complete replacement amino acid mixture to allow formation of new, complete skin protein that will accelerate the healing resulting from ascorbic acid therapy. Another example is a formulation that mimics the amino acid components of fibrinogen. The deficiency of fibrinogen called a fibrinogenemia, or hypofibrinogenemia, can result in blood clotting deficiencies (abnormal hemostasis), a coagulopathy. In addition to the common therapy of intravenously administering the sterile fraction of normal fibrinogen found in human plasma, the following inventive therapeutic formulation can be administered orally to accelerate improvement of clotting. This includes 15 moles L methionine. 41 moles L proline, 24 moles L tyrosine, 30 moles L asparagine, 28 moles L phenylalanine, 13 moles L cysteine, 51 moles L leucine, 107 moles L serine, 54 moles L arginine, 59 moles L threonine, 45 moles L valine, 19 moles L histidine, 97 moles glycine, 37 moles L alanine, 26 moles L \n\n isoleucine, 19 moles L tryptophan, 64 moles L glutamic acid, 42 moles L lysine, 50 moles L aspartic acid, and 30 moles L glutamine. The molar ratios may vary about 50%, and more preferably about 10%, and still provide the inventive therapy. By co-administration of this inventive formulation with administration of normal fibrinogen, the dependency on intravenous medication is reduced.\n\n\nWithout being limited by theory, it is believed that the inventive therapeutic formulations work to promote tissue repair by providing stem cells with the optimal ratios and proper stereoisomer form of amino acids that are needed to synthesize new tissue, or to allow the synthesis in-vivo of a desired medicament. Furthermore, it is believed that by supplying the body with the chemical components of the extracellular matrix, such as cartilage-containing chondroitin sulfate and collagen, tissue repair and anti-inflammatory anti-neoangiogenesis is enhanced. Also, it is believed that the two essential fatty acids, linolenic and linoleic acids, and eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) favorably enhance the body's production of anti-inflammatory prostaglandin 3, and prostaglandin 1, over the production of prostaglandin 2, which has been shown to mediate disease. Cell membrane formation and repair is believed to be enhanced synergistically by the administration simultaneously (as in one formulation) of lipids, phospholipids, lipoproteins essential fatty acids, and EPA.\n\n\nWithout being limited by theory, it is believed that the present invention functions by the method of altering the balance of free L amino acids such that under the law of mass action, protein synthesis is favored over proteolysis. By adding additional free amino acids, the activity of enzymes involved in protein synthesis and degradation, such as proteases, is driven in the direction of protein synthesis and therefore in the direction of tissue production rather than protein degradation. Also, it is believed that the addition of L amino acids inhibits or arrests the catabolic the protein degradation reactions of these enzymes. It is believed that the therapeutic compositions of the present invention can be used to achieve similar therapeutic effect as cyclosporins. Cyclosporins are a group of nonpolar, cyclic oligopeptides, with immunosuppressant activity. The therapeutic formulations of the invention would be advantageous over cyclosporin because it is believed that the inventive compositions would not have any of the following risks associated with cyclosporin therapy: cancer, nephrotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity. Cyclosporin effects are expected with the following composition (composition no. 1): 2 moles L valine, 4 moles L leucine, 2 moles L alanine, 1 mole glycine, and 2 moles of a methyl donor, such as methionine or betaine. The molar ratios may vary about 50%, and more preferably about 10%, and still provide the \n\n inventive therapy. For example, the 2 moles of L valine in the above formula may be considered 2 plus or minus 1 mole L valine and, more preferably, 2 plus or minus 0.2 mole L valine. Optionally, one mole of a methyl donor such as methionine or betaine is substituted with 1 mole of gamma amino butyric acid, also called 4-amino butyric acid (composition no. 2). Another preferred embodiment has the same components as composition no. 1 or no. 2 and further comprises one mole of a nine carbon ring amino acid derived from the metabolism of a microorganism such as the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum Gams, and an additional mole of a methyl donor. The molar ratios may vary about 50%, and more preferably about 10%, and still provide the inventive therapy. Preferably, the therapeutic formulation administered to mimic the effects of cyclosporin is comprised of optically pure L stereoisomers of the desired amino acids. If a formulation of optically pure L stereoisomers fails to yield the desired results in an acceptable time frame, however, it may be desirable to substitute 1 molar ratio of alanine in an optically pure D form for the L form. Such a substitution should more closely resemble the stereochemistry of the amino components naturally found in cyclosporin.\n\n\nAlthough sulfasalazine (also known as azulfidine) is not a protein or peptide, it is believed that the therapeutic effects of sulfasalazine can be mimicked by a therapeutic formulation of the present invention in which the presence of four nitrogen linkages, such as are present in sulfasalazine, may be simulated by an electron affinity of three or more high energy amphoteric, zwitterionic essential and non-essential L amino acids, preferably amino acids having aromatic side chains such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. Alternately, if the desired therapeutic goals are not achieved in an acceptable time, one mole of 5 aminosalicylate may be substituted for one of the three moles of high energy amino acids specified above. This internal milieu equilibrium might also be aided by bonded van der Waals forces, as is believed to function in the inventive therapeutic formulation corresponding to cyclosporin.\n\n\nIt is also believed that the therapeutic effects of protease inhibitors can be mimicked by a therapeutic formulation according to the present invention.\n\n\nIt is additionally believed that the therapeutic effects of antibiotics such as penicillin and cephalosporin can be mimicked by a therapeutic formulation of the present invention comprising amino acids that correspond to the amino components in a lactam ring, and particularly that correspond to the components in the CO--N bond of the beta-lactam ring. For example, a formulation comprising L alanine may be used. Also, a formulation of L \n\n glutamic acid may be used, as glutamic acid may lose one mole of water during digestion and metabolism to form a lactam of glutamic acid.\n\n\nThe therapeutic formulations of the present invention work with negligible risk of side effects or complications from therapy and are very safe.\n\n\n2. Formulations and Dosaging\n\n\nThe flavoring of the inventive therapy is a concern when not used in infancy. The free amino acids have a very disagreeable flavor that must be masked to obtain good patient compliance with the therapy. Oral formulations having elemental amino acids that are intended for patients over the age of one year preferably include one or more flavorants, synthetic or natural, such as grape, grapefruit, especially pink grapefruit, vanilla, cream, apple, chocolate (especially hypoallergenic). Milk permeates (especially hypoallergenic milk permeates) may be used, but preferably the microorganism debris is minimal. Most preferably no microorganism debris is detectable in milk permeates used as flavorants. Optimal efficacy of the inventive formulations and therapy occurs with concurrent avoidance of foods having exogenous catabolic debris. Foods avoided include, foods containing microorganism flora, debris and protein products, and foods that have been pasteurized, such as pasteurized dairy products, with the exception of lactic acid pro-biotic bacteria. Foods to avoid include those of such potentially significant microorganism content that pasteurization is required, and foods prepared by enzymatic activity of microorganisms, such as cheeses and wines produced by fermentation. The avoidance of foods with exogenous microorganism catabolic debris is believed to minimize or reduce the competition between catabolic products and the nutrients of the present invention and thereby drive protease activity that favors formation of healthy tissue and organ repair. The microorganism catabolic products, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and especially microorganism protein LPS, are expected to oppose the desired protein synthesis. Additionally, toxic metabolites of Aspergillus such as are found in peanuts are preferably avoided. In particular, patients suffering with Crohn's disease (regional ileitis) and congenital biliary atresia should avoid milk products. Preferably, the therapeutic formulation is free of hydrocolloids, preferably the hydrocolloids that might cause gastrointestinal irritation and inflammation.\n\n\nThis invention is applicable to treatment of all age groups, including prenatal, pediatric, adult and elderly. The invention is envisioned for use in treating any mammal. For \n\n example, the inventive therapy may be used to prevent or slow the cyclic epidemic spread of Johne's Disease (ileitis) in dairy cattle and other similar animals.\n\n\nProper dosages can be ascertained by one of skill in the art, using the teachings of this disclosure and readily available literature. Free amino acids may be derived from natural sources or synthetically produced. Suppliers include Ajinomoto USA of Torrance, Calif, and Tanabe USA Inc. of San Diego, Calif. One preferred source of amino acids is Neocate. RTM. elemental diet, sold by SHS of Liverpool, UK, which contains inter alia essential and nonessential amino acids, dried glucose syrup, fat, minerals, trace elements and vitamins.\n\n\nThe preferred amino acid dosages of the inventive therapeutic formulations are below the dosages recommended for an elemental diet for infants or others having gastrointestinal problems. Preferably, total daily free amino acid dosage is less than 20 grams, more preferably less than 15 grams, and still more preferably less than 10 grams. A preferred regime comprises administering 1-2 grams free amino acids three to four times daily, for a total dosage of three to eight grams daily. The higher dosages needed for a complete dietary supplement are commonly rejected by all but infants under age one because of the unpleasant taste and smell of free amino acids. By using much lower dosages, the present invention promotes patient compliance because small dosages may be administered in capsules or with flavorings such that taste problems are minimal.\n\n\nDosaging is dependent upon the age, body weight, and medical condition of the patient. Because of the negligible risks associated with the inventive therapy, higher dosages may be considered in more critical cases. The preferred effective total daily dosages of free amino acids is 0.5 to 20 grams, and more preferably 1 to 10 grams per day for an adult. ½ that dose is appropriate for children age 6 tol2, and ¼ that dose for children under age 6. Preferably the daily dosage is divided into 3 to 6 administrations per day. Preferably, the amino acids are provided in total daily dosages that are within the following weight ranges:\n\n\nL alanine preferred dosage, 0.05-12.5 grams, niore preferred dosage, 5-9 grams. L arginine preferred dosage, 0.05-12.5 grams, more preferred dosage, 1-9 grams. L asparagine preferred dosage, 0.05-12.5 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-9 grams. L aspartic acid preferred dosage, 0.05-6 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-6 grams. L cysteine preferred dosage, 0.1-1 gram, more preferred dosage, 0.5-1 grams. L cystine preferred dosage, 0.5-12.5 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-9 grams. L glutamine preferred dosage, 0.5-12.5 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-9 grams. \n\n L glutamic acid preferred dosage, 0.5-<6 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-6 grams.\n\n\nGlycine preferred dosage, 0.5-12.5 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-9 grams.\n\n\nL histidine preferred dosage, 0.5-12.5 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-9 grams.\n\n\nL isoleucine preferred dosage, 0.5-12.5 grams, more preferred dosage, 1 -9 grams. L leucine preferred dosage, 0.5-12.5 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-5 grams.\n\n\nL lysine preferred dosage, 0.5-12.5 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-9 grams.\n\n\nL methionine preferred dosage, 0.5-12.5 grains, more preferred dosage, 0.0.5-9 grams.\n\n\nL phenylalanine preferred dosage, 0.5-12.5 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-9 grams.\n\n\nL proline preferred dosage, 0.5-12.5 grams, more preferred dosage, 1-9 grams. L serine preferred dosage, 0.5->6 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-6 grams.\n\n\nL threonine preferred dosage, 5-12.5 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-9 grams.\n\n\nL tryptophan preferred dosage, 0.5->6 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-6 grams.\n\n\nL tyrosine preferred dosage, 0.5-12.5 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-9 grams.\n\n\nL valine preferred dosage, 0.5-5 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-9 grams. L taurine preferred dosage. 0.5-12.5 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-9 grams.\n\n\nL carnitine preferred dosage, 0.5-12.5 grams, more preferred dosage, 0.5-9 grams. The relative ratios of amino acids are derived as disclosed earlier from the ratios present in healthy tissue or medicament. These preferred molar ratios are then used to make a formulation for maximal dosage in 390 mg to 500 mg capsules, administered as about 5 capsules 3 to 4 times daily preferably. The total weight of an individual amino acid preferably should fall within the preferred weight ranges provided above.\n\n\nThe amino acids administered orally are readily available for absorption in the GI tract with minimal, if any degradation or processing required in the GI tract. This conserves the energy required by the GI tract and the spare energy can be used to repair diseased tissue or damaged organs.\n\n\nThis non-invasive medical therapy may be utilized with patients waiting for an organ transplant, or if possible, at an earlier stage in the organ disease. For example, the therapy may be administered prenatally by the mother ingesting the therapeutic formulations, or by direct administration of the formulation to the fetus. Duration of the inventive therapy is from a few weeks to several months. Longer duration of therapy may be considered because of the negligible risks associated with the inventive therapy. \n\n The compositions of the present invention may be formulated for oral, topical or parenteral use, especially oral. The topical formulations of the present invention may be presented as, for instance, ointments, creams or lotions, eye ointments and eye or ear drops, impregnated dressings and aerosols, and may contain appropriate conventional additives such as preservatives, solvents to assist drag penetration and emollients in ointments and creams. The formulations may also contain compatible conventional carriers, such as cream or ointment bases and ethanol or oleyl alcohol for lotions. Such carriers may be present as from about 1% up to about 98% of the formulation. More usually they will form up to about 80% of the formulation. Oral liquid preparations are typically in the form of a dry powder for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the therapeutic formulations of the invention and a sterile vehicle, water being preferred. It is also possible to prepare an oral mucosal delivery system such as that described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/080,990, entitled \"Methods and Compositions for Oral Delivery of Vitamins, Minerals, and Medications\", which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.\n\n\nIn special indications, particular precautions are necessary. For example, a patient having a coma or near coma with high ammonia levels, such as a patient suffering a complication of alcoholic cirrhosis, several L amino acids, such as L glutamate (also called L glutamic acid), and L aspartic acid, are desirable because they are believed to aid in ammonia removal. L glutamine is preferably avoided with cirrhosis of the liver, kidney disease, Reye's syndrome, or any other disease with increased ammonia blood levels. L cysteine, for a patient having a chronic illness, may be required at a level of 1 gram, 3 times daily for 1 month. L arginine should be avoided during pregnancy and breast feeding. In patients with schizophrenia, L arginine is preferably administered at dosages of less than 30 milligram per day.\n\n\nL valine, L isoleucine and L leucine each have branched aliphatic side chains. These amino acids are very helpful in diseases resulting from aging, as well as for trauma and infection. L tyrosine, L tryptophane, L phenylalanine and L histidine are advantageous for elderly patients with neurologic problems and depression. L methionine and L taurine are preferably used in hypersensitivity and autoimmune diseases.\n\n\nAdditionally, useful therapeutic applications for specific amino acids are provided in Tables IA, IB and 1C. This additional information may be useful in identifying specific cell or tissue proteins whose amino acid components can be mimicked in a therapeutic \n\n formulation of the invention. For example, tissues can be analyzed to locate high concentrations of specific amino acids known to favorably treat a specific ailment. From these tissues, specific proteins can be identified that are related to the ailment and the amino components of these proteins can be administered in one of the therapeutic formulations of the invention.\n\n\nTo protect unstable oils, storage in a frozen or refrigerated final product and/or a dark glass container is desirable to prevent lipid oxidation by light.\n\n\nLinolenic acid, an Omega-3 seed oil most abundant in flaxseed oil, is preferably administered at about 0.5 to 35 grams daily, and more preferably at about 3 to 10 grams daily. The following other lipids preferably are included in the therapeutic formulations of the invention at a preferred dose of 0.25 to 35 grams per day, and more preferably 0.5 to 2.0 grams per day: phospholipids and their essential fatty acids such as compound lipids, glycolipids, mono- and diglycerides, lipoproteins, including, but not limited to, cerebrocides and cephalin, 1 μL lipoproteins such as, but not limited to, lipovitellin, and phosphoprotcins. Vitellin is particularly preferred for a fetus at a preferred dosage of 0.5 to 2 grams.\n\n\nWhere shark cartilage is used, an adult dosage is in the range of a dosage of about 740 mg to about 1480 mg administered once to three times daily and preferably 2220 mg administered once daily. For major flare-ups of autoimmune diseases or bronchitis, dosages of up to about 2240 mg three times daily are recommended. Shark cartilage is preferably administered in powder in a capsule and contains cartilage with 12% chondroitin sulfate and collagen. Shark cartilage is sold under the name of Cartilade (Ontario, Canada, formerly BioTherapies, Inc., Fairfield NJ.) When hyaluronic acid and hyaluronan mucopolysaccharides are used, the source may be human umbilical cord tissue. The shark cartilage is immunologically preferred. This species is uniquely not affected by cancer and its skeletal structure is entirely cartilage.\n\n\nAutologous cartilage and chondrocytes are preferred for patients with arthritis. Preferred amino acid formulations for arthritic patients include the L amino acids combining with the body's glucose to form glucosamine, which is believed to be incorporated into the body's mucopolysaccharides. Such patients also benefit from hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, shark cartilage and nutrient substrate cartilage, available from many animals including cow, pig and chicken.\n\n\nThe preferred dosage of glucosamine is about 0.5 grams to about 1 gram, 3 times daily. The preferred dosage of chondroitin sulfate is about 250 to about 500 milligrams. 3 to 4 \n\n times daily. More preferred is 390 milligrams to 500 milligrams chondroitin sulfate administered three to four times daily. Preferably, chondroitin sulfate is administered in capsule form to minimize any unpleasant taste sensations and thereby encourage patient compliance. When EPA (eicosopentanoic acid) is used, the dosages may be about 0.36 to about 4.5 g daily, preferably about 0.36 grams to about 0.72 grams daily to three times daily. EPA is readily available commercially in soft gel capsules having 0.36 g EPA and 0.24 g DHA docosahexanoic acid in a 2 gram total fish oil capsule.\n\n\nPreferably, the medium chain fatty acids used in the therapeutic formulations are triglycerides or other naturally occurring fatty acids found in vegetable oils, such as coconut, and soybean oils. Medium and short chain fatty acids are desirable because they are readily metabolized to energy, required for acute illness, rather than stored as fat and do not require much processing by liver. Short chain fatty acids, such as but not limited to C. sub.4 butyric acid, are also useful in the invention, particularly those present or isolated from hypoallergenic butter.\n\n\nSuch short chain fatty acids have local anti-inflammatory action to help treat ileitis or skin burns, preferably in combination with 200 to 400 IU vitamin E oil.\n\n\nSugars useful in the present invention, such as glucose, corn syrup solids, and fructose, are preferably administered at the dosages recommended by dietary organizations, and are known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\nPreferably vitamins and minerals are administered with the therapeutic formulations of the invention. The preferred amounts of these components are provided in Table 2a, 2b, and 2c.\n\n\n3. Uses and Therapeutic Indications of the Invention and Pharmacological Mechanisms (A.)Healing of Cell and Tissue\n\n\nUse in reversing diseases of poor or guarded prognosis with the pharmacologic mechanisms as: (a.) an anti-inflammatory immuno-therapeutics mimicking human tissue and immunologic 'self therapeutically providing precursor micronutrient microenvironment also of immunologic 'self with (b.) associated activation of the patient's own stem cells non- invasively activating synthesis through amino acids specified by the genetic code in stimulating protein synthesis the polymerases of, DNA and RNA in stimulating the nuclear synthesis of DNA and RNA. There appears to be a self perpetuating cycle of making more \n\n DNA and RNA to in turn, synthesize protein through the amino acids and associated synergistic components of subject composition of matter. This seems to be analog to the biochemical model of the self polymerization of the nylon polymer once initiated.\n\n\n(B.) Providing a Genomic repair system\n\n\nThis homeostatic mechanism counters randomness, entropy, breakdown, and damage of normal tissue is perpetuated by the foregoing amino acid components of the organizational matrices of the cell, cell membranes, and tissue.\n\n\nThis biologic model and potential entree point of this self perpetuating DNA, RNA template pattern using monomelic AMINO ACID as monomeric raw material, stimulates protein polymerization and synthesis. This occurs through subject composition therapeutics AMINO ACID bolus, which is triggered by the law of mass action and components synergy such as, but not limited, to zinc, and B vitamins. It is believed to be analog to molecular embryologic studies by Gurdon, modifying the genomic code and pattern in the sea life egg. Gurdon has shown that the injection of a pure gene (chick egg albumin gene) into the nucleus (germinal vesicles) of sea life egg (Xenopus oocytes) was followed by intense and long lasting (several days) transcription of this gene. The resulting egg albumin mRNA moved into the egg cytoplasm where it was translated into chick egg albumin.\n\n\nThe genetic 'self perpetuating pathway includes, and is dependant upon, the L amino acids and glycine, specified by the molar ratio genetic code of the targeted protein. DNA and RNA protein synthesis arc possible through the foregoing amino acids programmed as L amino acids and glycine specified by the molar ratio genetic code of therapeutically targeted protein. These amino acids, along with the synergistic organizational matrices of components of subject composition, are believed to therapeutically provide an L amino acid and glycine entree point to normalize the genetic code.\n\n\nThe therapeutic subject composition is believed to provide this self perpetuating genetic cycle and consists of the following organizational matrices: the cell membrane organizational system led by the self vesiculating, bio-robotic, bilamellar micelle L phospholipid. This liquid crystal bilamellar chemical micelle provides 20% of the cell membrane. The organizational component initiates the colloidal domain emulsion, and is associated with the L amino acids and glycine monomers. These monomeric amino acids of subject composition are specified by the molar ratio of the genetic code of therapeutically targeted protein. These amino acid monomers constitute the precursor source of the \n\n polymerized 80% of the cell membrane, as polymerized protein that have many functions including receptor sites and selective pumps.\n\n\nThe 3-D stereo chemical L amino acid and glycine organizational matrix, with the L phospholipids are unique to mammalian and human tissue (and differ in the case of micro organisms in that they normally contain D-amino acids that include D-alanine and D- glutamic acid). These L stereoisomers seem to provide the natural relationship with D- polysaccharides, composed of the D-monomers of D-hexose, as in the extracellular matrix compartment and D-pentose as in nuclear compartment DNA and RNA. The biochemical cell model has been used to view the function of these polymerized D-monosaccharide glycosylated in the Golgi apparatus of the cytoplasm. This functionality as tracking tags, guides the extracellular matrix (ECM). This thereby provides a soft skeleton scaffold to maintain the cells in this ECM. Otherwise, we would just be a clump of cells which has been demonstrated by the first cleavage of the stem cells in the experimental animal. If this ECM such as collagen, laminin, fibronectin is filtered away, the cells fall apart by selective filtration) only to be re-associated when the extra cellular matrix is again reproduced.\n\n\nThereby, this ECM organizational matrix of this therapeutic subject composition of matter serves a similar function in treating damaged tissue. (See Figures 2 and 3)\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention provides an anabolic medicament for treating a damaged tissue. This composition of matter is also representative of organizational cellular and stem cell matrices of 1.) cell membrane receptor and activation of polar surface active lipids such as phospholipids; 2.) DNA, RNA templated protein synthesis and a protein enzyme polymerase for DNA RNA synthesis; 3.) Extracellular matrix cellular scaffold is selected from the group consisting of a glycosaminoglycan, a collagen, cartilage, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, deratin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, a glycoprotein, and a proteoglycan; 4.) anabolic anti catabolic synergistic organizational matrices of additional activating synergizing vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. All these matrices are concurrently precursor micro- nutrient microenvironment of immunologic 'self and again does not cross the immune- inflammatory barriers and as chemically invisible does not only produce but also significantly reduce the destructive inflammatory cytokines as well as producing inflammatory receptor antagonist cytokines and is therefore anti-catabolic as well as anti inflammatory pharmacodynamic mechanisms. AU these therapeutic organizational matrix components utilize the most common non covalent biologic bonding system of human and other mammalian tissues readily available for homeostatic metabolic interchange. \n\n Yet another aspect of the invention provides an anabolic medicament for treating a damaged tissue. The medicament comprises, the organizational cell membrane matrix, essential for cell and tissue life and biologic function, which consists of at least one naturally occurring polar surface active lipid, wherein said polar surface active lipid is selected from the group consisting of a phospholipid, a glycolipid and a lipoprotein; phospholipids such as, phosphatidyl choline that bio-robotically self vesiculates to provide the spherical, bubble like shape of the cell, defined by the organizational cell membrane in the optical levorotary L form. No more than 10% of the phospholipids being in the D- form, 20% phospholipid, the 80% L amino acid glycine contained in cell membrane protein that functions as a selective protein pump, regulating the concentration of minerals (such as sodium, potassium and calcium) in and out of the cell; 38% of which is phosphatidyl choline (PC) (in the case of microorganisms, 0% PC is present),the L-amino acid and glycine of the targeted protein specified by the genetic code, selected from the group consisting of a glycosaminoglycan, a collagen, cartilage, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, deratin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, a glycoprotein, and a proteoglycan.\n\n\nIn conjunction with the organizational matrices of subject composition that we have found also to correspond with the organizational matrices of the stem cell and the formation of the primary amino acid polymer; the secondary folding is dependent upon the comparative hydrophilic/lipophilic forces, characteristic of each L-amino acid and glycine. This is ultimately characterized by the final 3-D folded arrangement of the tertiary protein, which provides its biologic function. All this is bio-molecularly inter-dependent with the organizational matrices of therapeutic subject composition that also corresponds with the organizational matrices of the developing embryonic stem cell and the corresponding healing stem cell itself. The stem cell and the synergistic organizational matrices of therapeutic subject composition as seen in the healing, anti-inflammatory effect of the stem cell, and its role in molecular embryology, genesis of embryonic stem cell in molecular embryology: These molecular biochemical steps of embryogenesis are identical to the molecular biochemical subject composition of matter, and therefore the same activating biochemical molecules as the stem cell:\n\n\n1. Cell membrane organizational matrix (see Peil supra)) activation in cell membrane fusion of the sperm and egg, amphimixy, in fertilization by the sperm's release of \n\n phospholipase to remove one fatty acid 'arm', providing an increase in hydrophilicity, resulting in fusion of the membranes of the sperm and the egg.\n\n\n2. Within a few minutes of sperm fertilization, the organizational matrix (see Peil supra)) L-amino acid glycine, specified by the genetic code of protein synthesis is initiated. Experimental tracking using radio-actively tagged free amino acids, are now being incorporated into protein synthesis in the now activated metabolic, 'sleeping' egg.\n\n\n3. Upon cleavage of the embryonic stem cell, the production of the organizational extra-cellular matrix (see Peil supra)) scaffold is activated. When filtered away, the cells fall apart, only to be reformed so that cell adherence organization can continue. Each step of embryogenesis can be arrested by similar experimental removal from arresting the life of the cell itself, to arresting gastrulation and neurulation. (See Figure 5)\n\n\nThe organizational cell membrane matrix, essential for cell and tissue life and biologic function, consists of at least one naturally occurring polar surface active lipid. The polar surface active lipid is selected from the group consisting of a phospholipid, a glycolipid and a lipoprotein. Phospholipids such as, phosphatidyl choline, bio-robotically self vesiculates to provide the spherical, bubble like shape of the cell, defined by the organizational cell membrane in the optical levorotary L form. No more than 10% of the phospholipids being in the D- form 20% phospholipid, the 80% protein also functions as a selective protein pump. Additionally, it regulates the concentration of minerals (such as sodium, potassium and calcium) in and out of the cell; 38% of which is phosphatidyl choline (PC) (in the case of microorganisms, 0% PC is present advantageously) the L-amino acid and glycine of the targeted protein specified by the genetic code. A plurality of amino acids having an alpha carbon, the amino acids being present at a molar ratio as specified by the genetic code. This is characteristic of the targeted protein in such as human breast milk protein, bowel protein, such as skin proteins. Wherein no more than 10% of the amino acids are in D-foπn, a plurality of amino acids having an alpha carbon, the amino acids.\n\n\nThe cell membrane organizational matrix and its hydrophilic forces so provide function in conjunction with the extra-cellular organizational matrix (ECM). a glycosaminoglycan, a collagen, cartilage, chondroitin sulfate, keratin sulfate, heparan sulfate, (a highly anionically charged, highly sulfated, highly hydrophilic, ECM component) glucosamine sulfate, a glycoprotein, and a proteoglycan; These hydrophilic forces are found to simulate the most hydrophilic surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate which it simulates the ECM components, such as glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, and \n\n (most important component of the basement membrane of the glomerulus of the kidneys filtration system. All these ECM components are not only highly hydrophilic, but also, anionically charged. All the ECM protein components are glycoproteins which are glycosylated and import additional hydrophilic forces in the GoI gi apparatus of all the cells' cytoplasm.\n\n\nThe HLB Mechanisms of Protein Folding of Amino Acids in the Polypeptide Chains of\n\n\nProteins\n\n\nThese amino acids function in protein folding as dipolar magnets with forces mediated by the HLB balance, ratios and particle charges where the majority (80%) of essential amino acids are more lipophilic and the branched chain amino acids being the most lipophilic. Wherein, the majority (80%) of the non-essential amino acids are hydrophilic.\n\n\nThese in turn fold in accordance with their relative HLB value so that the essential amino acids can be found in the center. The final folded protein is a lipophilic protein core analogous to a fetus being protected by the surrounding hydrophilic surfactant amino acids. These amino acid components Ic are all liquid crystals with amphiphilic polar surface activity of 6,974.796.\n\n\nComponent 1C functions like component Ib and the glycoprotein ECM of component I a.\n\n\nAdditionally, parts of the ECM have a lipid foot anchor to the cell membrane. These glypicans are being similarly composed of amino acids with a hydrophilic signaling the destination directional carbohydrate moiety for each glycoprotein.\n\n\nThe relatively highly hydrophilic effect so important in wound healing are also effected by the components of 6,974,796 and subsequent patent filings appear to explain the anti-cancer activity of the components that are highly hydrophilic. (See Figure 4)\n\n\n(C.) Anti-inflammatory effects, and anti-inflammatory effect in conjunction with cell and tissue healing\n\n\nThe pharmacodynamics and subject therapeutic compositiυn-υf-matter result in cell/tissue immunologic healing through the production, in-vivo, of DNA, RNA and protoplasmic tissue protein. This therapeutics provides the pharmacodynamics of cell and tissue healing, repair and regeneration with significant anti-inflammatory activity. This subject composition therapeutics also includes a reduction in chemical mediator, chemo- attractant inflammatory cytokines, uniquely associated with the stimulus of protein synthesis \n\n in healing. Tissue healing integrity, strength and resilience result, being first initiated by normalization of the cell membrane receptor system. This includes 247 case reports, clinical, in-vivo, oral, and intravenous and local delivery system application inclusive of 70 in-vitro studies which further includes in-vivo, 27 equine veterinarian therapeutic responses (serving as pre-clinical cell biology study models as well as specific care for equine veterinarian diseases).\n\n\nAdditionally, the Omega-3 fish oils reside in the organizational cell membrane matrix of subject composition. In this capacity, these FDA pre-approved-as-safe, components reduce inflammatory prostaglandins without any known undesirable effects. The mechanism by which this is done is replacement of arachadonic acid at membrane storage sites in phospholipids in dietary fish oil. It serves as a poor substrate for convergence to active metabolites of a cyclo-oxynigase formation of prostaglandin (inhibited by NSAID), particularly the lipo-oxyginase series (not inhibited by NSAID). Therefore, we have also shown here an advantage of the Omega 3-fatty acid fish oils adding to the anti-inflammatory effect of subject composition therapeutics, over and above NSAID, such as aspirin.\n\n\nThis is in contrast to available anti-inflammatory drugs, such as the non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID and steroidal drugs) that interfere with healing and protein synthesis, even though they have an anti-inflammatory effect. As a result of this intermolecular sliding, in contrast to the L-amino acid glycine specified by the genetic code 3-D fit, NSAID compounds interfere with protein synthesis and healing. This concurs with 20 recent studies: recommending avoidance of NSAID wound healing; included in their entirety by reference.\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to an immuno-therapeutics composition and use thereof for disease of poor or guarded prognosis that mimic mammalian and human tissue, immunologic 'self, healing, and repair and regeneration systems. This immuno-therapeutics activates synthesis of protein, DNA, RNA, and the patient's own stem cells. The foregoing synthesis is activated non-invasively, with anti-inflammatory efficacy, averting the need for organ and skin transplantation. The anti-inflammatory anti-arthritic tissue healing, repair and regeneration efficacy averts the need for joint replacement prostheses, along with in-vitro, and in-vivo anti-cancer efficacy.\n\n\n(D.) Pain Management and Pharmacologic Mechanisms with Use of Subject Composition: \n\n These therapeutics offer a highly unique and desirable approach in pain control management by providing definitive, as well as symptomatic, pain relief and pain prevention. The unique immunotherapeutic agent of Immunopath Profile Inc. (IPI) is an FDA approved biomaterial therapeutics. It has been observed to treat pain of many known etiologies. Successes have also been seen in pain accompanying various forms of malignancy. This modality of treatment embraces an individual's own natural cellular make-up. This has been cited as regenerative medicine which includes the revitalization of tissue and its normal neural response to IPFs immunotherapeutic approach to the treatment of pain. This therapeutics is readily adaptable with other modes of treatment. Regenerative medicine with IPFs therapeutics provides resolution of diseases of poor prognosis that now have the additional benefit of successful pain relief.\n\n\nIn summary, the subject invention presents a more definitive regenerative medicine immunotherapeutics for disease resolution in, such as but not limited to, this progressively severe inflammatory disease, IBD and may include ulcerative colitis, mucus colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and further include celiac disease because of mechanisms herein of improving abnormal intestinal permeability. About 25% of the cases in Crohn's and IBD have an onset in childhood.\n\n\nIBD is a chronic persistent inflammatory disease of poor or guarded prognosis and a pathogenic continuum which can progress to cancer, caused by inflammatory chemicals released that perpetuate inflammation, cytokines, chemokines, cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase prostaglandins and other inflammatory chemicals provide a distinct network of intercellular signaling which promote development of cancer. \"Chronic inflammation plays a multifaceted role in carcinogenesis\".... \"metastasis and invasion\", \"tumor angiogenesis\" The subject invention provides sustained anti-inflammatory protein synthesis stimulating healing therapy has been shown to block production of inflammatory cytokines and increase production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (Meister 2000) and its extension to cancer.\n\n\nAs exemplified by the 30X predisposition to bowel cancer in contrast to the general public with prolonged inflammatory disease as seen in ulcerative colitis and the 6x predisposition to bowel cancer in contrast to the general public of Crohn's disease. The same unique anti-inflammatory efficacy to arrest persistent aggressive inflammatory action of IBD by subject composition immunotherapeutics is used here for its preventive anti-cancer therapeutic efficacy and safety which has been optimized and maximized in this therapeutics. \n\n Using therapeutic subject composition includes the management of diseases and damaged tissue with particular regard to, but not limited to, diseases of poor and guarded prognosis, inflammatory changes, accompany failure to heal. Pain management (pain control) efficacy has been established based on the clinical experience of 177 patients included in this therapeutics. Therefore this subject composition therapeutics is included as a pain management medication. The inflammatory changes are associated with pain, swelling, redness and heat. Inflammation is present in all of the major diseases such as trauma, inflammatory diseases, and neoplastic diseases. The pharmacologic mechanisms for pain relief include reduction of inflammation by as much as 80%, and providing an increase in inflammatory antagonistic factors by as much as 80%. These inflammatory antagonistic factors include such as ILl receptor antagonist of inflammatory cytokine and chemo- attractant chemicals, otherwise released by the immune-inflammatory system. Additionally, since subject composition functions as immunologic 'self, it is therefore bio-chemically invisible and does not cross the immune-inflammatory system. It therefore does not activate cytokine release, as many other medications do as part of the pharmacologic mechanism of their undesirable effects. This is probably a major reason why the components of subject composition that have additionally been screened immunologically, are in the category of FDA pre-approved-as-safe components. This includes their final composition of matter which has mimicked human tissue and immunologic 'self. With use of subject composition pain control in these diseases or poor or guarded prognosis, pain management and pain control has been accomplished.\n\n\nAdditionally, the Omega-3 fish oils reside in the organizational cell membrane matrix of subject composition. In this capacity, these FDA pre-approved-as-safe, components reduce inflammatory prostaglandins without any known undesirable effects. The mechanism by which this is done is replacement of arachadonic acid at membrane storage sites in phospholipids in dietary fish oil. It serves as a poor substrate for convergence to active metabolites of a cyclo-oxynigase formation of prostaglandin (inhibited by NSAID), particularly the lipo-oxygenase series (not inhibited by NSAID).\n\n\nTherefore, we have also shown an advantage of the Omega 3 -fatty acid fish oils adding to the anti-inflammatory effect of subject composition therapeutics, over and above NSAID, such as aspirin. The importance of the production of the inflammatory chemicals cytokine, chemokines and prostaglandins in chronic persistent inflammation and its continuum and extension to cancer is shown by the therapeutic efficacy of subject \n\n composition. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as the NSAID exemplified by aspirin are demonstrated by the 25-50% successful anti-cancer activity of aspirin. However, aspirin unfortunately inhibits protein synthesis, healing and stem cell healing activity. Therefore, this significantly lessons the value of these compounds and illustrates the advantage of the regenerative medicine taught by the subject and related applications. This advance provides anti-inflammation and stimulation of protein synthesis and healing.\n\n\n(Case 1.) Pain management of a male patient, age 82, presenting with prodromal symptoms of herpes with severe unilateral left ocular edema and conjunctivitis with vesicles on left side of forehead. A very common associated clinical finding of herpes zoster of the forehead up to the hairline, This was preceded by pain upon combing hair, also on the left side of head, one day prior to dermatologic involvement. Transdermal cream of subject composition was applied to left scalp and left forehead was associated with clearance pain with particularly noteworthy absence of residual pain. Usually this is associated with poor prognosis in regard to the persistence of pain. Also, corneal damage was not noted in this patient with use of subject composition transdermally, (as presented here in case reports of reversal of arthritis and tendo-synovitis in 27 horses of equine species). The treating ophthalmologist was happily surprised with this outcome. He did not feel the acyclovir topical 5% applied 3 times daily played a role. Nor did he feel that the acyclovir oral therapy 200 ing 3 to 4 times daily played definitive role seen with subject composition in completely averting the very common residual complications of herpes zoster and normalizing neuronal impulse flow along with normalizing tissue structure and function, (one year follow-up)\n\n\nCase 2.) report of a male patient, early 80s, normalizing post abdominal surgery of right upper quadrant, residual incisional anesthesia associated with residual complication of cholecystectomy of gangrenous cholecystitis, a complication of cholelithiasis, (further complicated by e-coli septicemia). Numbness of the skin of the right upper quadrant has persisted since surgery several years prior. Clearance of numbness resulted with the use of the transdeπnal cream applied 2 to 3 times daily for one week. Again, this normalization of tissue and normalization of neuronal flow has remained normal since transdermal cream application, (about one year). \n\n Case 3.) Pain management, of a female patient, age 75, who was awakened with acute cervical pain and tenderness. Treated with transdermal cream she was able to return to sleep, and awoke in the morning with no pain. The patient has remained symptom free, to date, for more than one year. Past history of a similar onset of acute cervical arthritis which took several months of orthopedic care for symptoms to resolve.\n\n\nPlease note that the local use of a component of human tissue such as vitamin E (alpha tocopherol) by expressing it from a vitamin E capsule (400 IU) andapplying the oily contents onto the wound or area of pain has significantly augmented pain management and alleviated local pain. This is also a component of subject composition. Significant relief has been repeatedly noted. This pain management component has been used in many patients of varied ages and multiplicity of causes with continued good success, alone or as a component of subject composition as in the transdermal cream.\n\n\n(E.) Stem cell activation in the treatment of tissue damaged such as by trauma or disease and the stimulation of healing through activation of the patient's own stem cells using:\n\n\nThis therapeutic subject composition breakthrough activates, non-invasively, the patient's own stem cells, allowing the cells to thrive in-vivo or in-vitro without any apparent risks. This includes 247 case reports of, clinical diseases of poor or guarded prognosis in- vivo, in-vitro, oral, intravenous and local transdermal delivery system application, including 25 equine veterinarian therapeutic response and in-vitro studies. This represents the pharmacodynamic end-point of cell biology, and biochemical activation of the patient's own stem cells in regeneration and repair of the patient's diseased and damaged tissue.\n\n\nThe pharmacodynamics and subject therapeutic composition-of-matter protected by issued patent claims result in cell/tissue immunologic healing through the production, in- vivo, of DNA, RNA and protoplasmic tissue protein. This therapeutics provides the pharmacodynamics of cell and tissue healing, repair and regeneration. Subject composition therapeutics provides significant anti-inflammatory activity and reduction in chemical mediator chemo-attractant inflammatory cytokines, uniquely associated with the stimulus of protein synthesis in healing. Tissue healing integrity, strength and resilience result, are being first initiated by normalization of the cell membrane receptor system.\n\n\nThis occurs by mimicking human or animal tissue respectively; using biochemical equivalent components, FDA pre-approved-as-safe, immunologically further screened so as \n\n not to cross the immimo-inflammatory surveillance barrier. Also, this is the case of mimicking the embryonic stem cells from which all cell and tissue originates. The pharmacologic impact of therapeutics subject composition cell free microenvironment, can best be seen with this diagram of the progressive development of the embryonic stem cell. (Non-invasively applied in anabolic tissue healing stimulation of protein synthesis and inhibiting the chemical mediators of inflammation and associated anti-inflammatory activity.)\n\n\nThis subject composition therapeutics is not only based on mimicking human tissue using biochemical equivalents of human tissue that are FDA pre-approved-as-safe. We simultaneously mimicked the human tissue's healing, repair, and regeneration using the same components representing biochemical equivalents of human tissue from the healing repair and regeneration system. This has been found to be equivalent to mimicking the embryogenesis and the embryonic stem cell.\n\n\n(F.) The stem cell and the synergistic organizational matrices of therapeutic subject composition as seen in the healing, anti-inflammatory effect of the stem cell and its role in molecular embryology, genesis of embryonic stem cell in molecular embryology\n\n\nThese molecular biochemical steps of embryogenesis are identical to the molecular biochemical composition of matter of subject composition, and therefore the same activating biochemical molecules as the stem cell: 1. Cell membrane organizational matrix activation in cell membrane fusion of the sperm and egg, amphimixy in fertilization by the sperm's release of phospholipase to remove one fatty acid 'arm', providing an increase in hydrophilicity resulting in fusion of the membranes of the sperm and the egg.\n\n\n2. Within a few minutes of sperm fertilization, the organizational matrix L-amino acid glycine, specified by the genetic code of protein synthesis along with the L phospholipid, serving to initiate cell membrane organizational system. Experimental tracking using radio- actively tagged free amino acids are now being incorporated into protein synthesis in the now activated metabolic, 'sleeping' egg. These sexual reproductive cells, active in meiosis, after fertilization, the anabolic enzymatic system of somatic cells have been initiated and mRNA production and translation, protein synthesis and the aerobic cell cycles are initiated, only to be momentarily interrupted by anaerobic mitosis and cleavage.\n\n\n3. Upon cleavage of the embryonic stem cell, the production of the organizational extra-cellular matrix scaffold is activated. When filtered away, the cells fall apart, only to be \n\n reformed so that cell adherence organization can continue. Each step of embryogenesis can be arrested by similar experimental removal from arresting the life of the cell itself, to arresting gastrulation and neurulation.\n\n\nSubject composition is therapeutically represented here by mimicking human tissue and immunologic 'self with the use of bio-chemical equivalents of human tissue. Additionally, the precursor micronutrient microenvironment also mimics human tissue immunologic 'self. All these components have additionally been screened as to not cross the immuno-infiammatory surveillance barrier. As immunologic 'self, these components are bio-chemically invisible to the immuno-infiammatory surveillance system, the basis for their significant tolerance. This subject composition therapeutics activates the patient's own stem cells to promote healing and regeneration of tissue. This therapeutics also includes the activation of protein synthesis, with anti-inflammatory activity reducing inflammatory cytokines, and associated chemo-attractant activity along. It also activates antagonist interleukin inflammatory receptor and associated activation of the immune protective system. The subject composition therapeutics and its components approach, derived from mimicking human tissue, and the healing system of human tissue, corresponds to the activation of the genesis of the embryonic stem cell shown above such as:\n\n\n1. Organizational cell membrane phospholipids\n\n\n2. Activation of the organizational protein synthesis system by use of L amino acids in protein specified by the genetic code, in stimulating the protein synthesis production of targeted protein such as developmental protein mimicking human tissue's breast milk protein.\n\n\n3. Activation of the extra cellular matrix system with the use of ECM components such as, but not limited to, glycosaminoglycans, collagen, cartilage, chondroitin sulfate, glycoprotein and proteoglycan. Subject composition further includes synergistic micronutrient microenvironment, vitamins such as Vitamin A, vitamin D; minerals such as zinc; essential lipids such as (and with particular reference to) Omega 3 fatty acid fats.\n\n\nTherapeutic problem to be solved: by tracking with histopathology of disease and tissue breakdown, revealing similar initiation of breakdown of cell membrane and associated abnormal increased permeability and loss of cytoplasmic content. This is all without the risk of undesirable effects such as transdiffercntiation, mutagenesis, and concerns of disease transmission. No known undesirable effects including avoidance, or significantly minimizing steroid requirements and dependency. \n\n The added beneficial therapeutic effects include significant steroid sparing. Another added advantage is avoidance or significantly minimizing steroid requirements and dependency.\n\n\nThe Stem Cell Solution of: Activation of the patient's own stem cells with therapeutic subject composition of matter.\n\n\nThe therapeutic subject composition, breakthrough activates, non-invasively, the patient's own stem cells, allowing the cells to thrive in-vivo, or in-vitro, without any apparent risks. This includes 247 case reports clinical, in-vivo, and in-vitro studies.\n\n\n(G.) Congenital biliary atresia.\n\n\nThe present invention is particularly effective for treating congenital biliary atresia, a stem cell focused disease. A small population of stem cells located in the junction between liver cells and the smallest segments of the biliary tree (as shown in FIG. 1) ma)' differentiate into liver cells and biliary duct epithelium. These hepato biliary cells are known to participate in regeneration that occurs in certain forms of hepatitis. Thus, in congenital biliary atresia, the stem cells are able to grow new tissue located in close proximity to the damaged tissue. The damaged tissue, as shown in FlG. 1, has periductular inflammation and fibrosis. The focus of maximal disease is at the junction of the smallest ductules of the biliary tree and the adjacent liver cells (hepatocytes). This is also the location of stem cells that are capable of regenerating liver tissue cells.\n\n\n(H.) Bronchial asthma\n\n\nThe invention is also effective for treating bronchial asthma. Without being bound by any theory, the disease is believed to be similar to congenital biliary atresia, because it results in inflammation or blockage of small tubules that probably are in close proximity to stem cells. In bronchial asthma, the blockage occurs in very small tubules or bronchioles, which are unprotected by the support of cartilage in contrast to the remainder of the bronchial tree. Dramatic relief from asthma symptoms has been observed in asthmatic patients, usually young children that are receiving elemental feedings, as complete nutritional support, because of cow milk allergies. Furthermore, such patients have not been observed to suffer from 'dismodeling', a term used herein as a synonym for remodeling. Such patients are able to discontinue or reduce the use of inhalation therapy of corticosteroids and bronchodilators. \n\n These therapeutic compositions, according to the present invention, should help reduce the risks of adverse reactions associated with the use of certain allergenic plasticizcrs in renal dialysis. Thereby this therapeutic prevents recurrent anaphylaxis in dialysis, and eliminates acute flare-ups. Furthermore, this therapeutic composition is believed useful in reducing the risk of kidney transplantation rejection.\n\n\n(1.) Crohn's Disease\n\n\nWithout being bound to any theory, it is thought that the essential components of the therapeutic formulations promote favorable substrate nutrition in-vivo, as well as in- vitro, for stem cells to thrive in tissue repair, replacement and regeneration. Such effects are believed to occur in mesodermal and mesenchymal tissue, as well as endodermal surfaces, such as the respiratory tract. Ailments of the GI tract such as regional ileitis (Crohn's Disease), and other inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis, mucous colitis, and liver disease such as, but not limited to, congenital biliary atresia, are all believed to be amenable to treatment with the inventive formulations and therapy. The inventive therapy is particularly advantageous for inflammatory bowel diseases that are very resistant to present therapies.\n\n\nFurthermore, the simultaneous administration of components of the therapeutic formulations is believed to work synergistically to promote tissue healing at higher levels and at a more rapid speed than if the components were administered individually at different times. In particular, the administration of a combination of L-amino acids is believed to be much more effective therapy than administration of the same amounts of individual amino acids over time; as the individual amino acids are not concurrently in the blood stream.\n\n\n(J.) Leprosy The inventive non-invasive therapy can also be used in the treatment of deforming diseases, such as leprosy, and skin and nerve damage. Bacterial infections and epidemics, such as drug resistant tuberculosis epidemics, may also be treated with a therapeutic formulation in which the components mimic the components of an antibiotic.\n\n\n(K.) Dermatologic Diseases\n\n\nDiseases of the ectodermal surfaces including skin, hair, nails and teeth, are amenable to amelioration by use of the inventive compositions and therapy. In particular, eczema, \n\n urticaria and psoriasis may be treated. The therapeutic formulations according to the present invention, can accelerate healing and reduce the risks of e.g. corneal graft rejection.\n\n\nNoteworthy, is the therapeutic response in the patient age 80, who also had a persistent fungal infection of several months duration, in the right medial corner of his middle finger nail and nail bed (ungual tinea infection). The treated area (fortunately but initially unintentionally included in application to this area while applying the foregoing to the right arm torn rotator cuff area of damaged tissue) returned to normal in a few weeks, with normal re-growth of nail. Since unintentional and inadvertent initially, this might be looked upon as a variant of a blind therapeutic application with clinical response to chronic fungal (tinea), otherwise unresponsive to treatment. See also therapeutic details of this example in Torn\n\n\nRotator Cuff in group of, musculo-skeletal disease cases, Example 14.\n\n\nDiseases akin to congenital biliary atresia from a therapeutic standpoint (e.g., ileitis) will show dramatic results from the present invention. For example, a patient that has ileitis will not require corticosteroids for as long as 7 months after therapy when this therapeutic formulation has been administered successfully and discontinued.\n\n\nIn the aging process, when the production of digestive enzymes and growth hormone is diminished, the free amino acids of the inventive, non-invasive therapeutic composition, are anabolic and stimulate production of growth hoπnones, which are both beneficial.\n\n\nThe inventive therapeutic formulations of the present invention may be used to drive anabolic processes for immunopathies such as milk allergies, colitis, and autoimmune diseases.\n\n\nThe inventive therapeutic formulations of the present invention may be used to provide treatment for burns. This subject composition therapeutics, such as transdermal lotion, has been effective in reversing the effects of severe bums of the skin.\n\n\n(L.) AIDS and therapeutic subject composition\n\n\nFurthermore, it is believed that the therapeutic formulations of the present invention can be used with AIDS patients on antiprotease drugs as a substrate analog and metabolic analog. Without limiting the invention in any way, it is believed that by administering the therapeutic formulations of the present invention and avoiding or minimizing ingestion of foods containing protein or peptides or containing microorganism metabolites or catabolic products (such as dairy products), the patient's recovery will be enhanced for the following reasons. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract will be only minimally occupied in proteolysis of \n\n exogenous proteins, and will still serve its inimune-like functions, such as controlling microorganisms (an antibiotic-like function), fight viruses, and aid in the repair of injured tissue permitting tissue healing. AIDS patients on conventional anti-proteasc drugs often have extreme hyperlipidemia, with serum triglyceride levels of 3,000 to 6,000 mg %. The conventional anti-protease medication may need to be withdrawn to protect the heart and blood vessels from the medication's side-effects, such as coronary artery disease. Administration of the therapeutic formulations of the present invention to AIDS patients on antiprotease drugs with concurrent avoidance of ingestion of the foods described above is expected to solve this dilemma. It is also expected to reduce the undesirable side effects of the drugs because the GI tract will only be minimally involved in protein breakdown or proteolytic action. It is believed that the proteases throughout the body will be coerced by the law of mass action into cell and tissue anabolism.\n\n\nIt is further believed that the therapeutic formulations of the invention can be used as a supplement to antiprotease therapy, and thereby allow for antiprotease dosages to be lessened and their side effects reduced while achieving the same therapeutic results. Preferably, AIDS patients on the inventive therapy should avoid ingesting catabolic products of microorganisms including their metabolites such as bacterial proteins and their metabolites, with exception of therapeutic effect as in subject composition of probiotic lactic acid bacteria, including dairy products. Furthermore, it is believed that the inventive formulations will act to repair HIV-damaged cells and tissue by supplying the building blocks needed, namely, amino acids, cell wall components, and extracellular matrix components. By the administration of these building blocks together in one formulation, it is believed that the components will act synergistically to allow for much faster and more complete cell and tissue repair than if administered separately. Without intending to limit the invention in any way, it is believed that the law of mass action will apply and cause proteases throughout the body to create proteins, rather than degrade them.\n\n\n(M.) Immuno-therapeutics, an adjuvant to vaccine therapy as well as anti-cancer vaccine therapy Therapeutic subject composition cell/tissue immune function, nanotechnology therapeutics, is especially adaptable to co-use with anticancer vaccines. Its in-vitro, and in- vivo, anticancer activity has also been shown to significantly reduce cancer tissue and its antigenic presence, along with increase immune response. A very favorable bio- \n\n pharmacologic immunologic anti-cancer response strategy has evolved here including immunogenic adjuvant, along with several file patents therapeutic composition of matter.\n\n\nThe pharmacodynamics and subject therapeutic composilion-of-matter protected by issued patent claims results in cell/tissue immunologic healing through the production, in- vivo, of DNA, RNA and protoplasmic tissue protein. This therapeutics provides the pharmacodynamics of cell and tissue healing, repair and regeneration with significant antiinflammatory activity and reduction in chemical mediator chemo attractant inflammatory cytokines, uniquely associated with the stimulus of protein synthesis in healing.\n\n\nTissue healing integrity, strength and resilience result, being first initiated by normalization of the cell membrane receptor system.\n\n\nThis occurs by mimicking human or animal tissue respectively, using biochemical equivalent components, FD A pre-approved-as -safe, and further immunologically screened so as not to cross the immuno-inflammatory surveillance barrier. Also, this is the case of mimicking the embryonic stem cells from which all cell/tissue originate. The pharmacologic impact of subject composition therapeutics cell free microenvironment can best be seen with this diagram of the progressive development of the embryonic stem cell. (Non-invasively applied in anabolic tissue healing stimulation of protein synthesis and inhibiting the chemical mediators of inflammation and associated anti-inflammatory activity.)\n\n\nOf 70 studies, of the foregoing 247 clinical and preclinical studies of diseases of poor or guarded prognosis, representing 44 bio-chemicals, 27% (12 of 44) dramatized a 3-D biochemical trend. This trend is also computerizable and provides positive therapeutic results, killing in excess of 88% of cancer tissue within 24 to 48 hours. Five (5) of these studies demonstrated a cancer cell kill rate of 99% to 100% in the same time frame. This is particularly noteworthy since these results were achieved using FDA pre-approved-as-safe components comprising subject composition synthetic cell-free micro-environment therapeutics.\n\n\nEach step represents a cell biology model of the normal process of the biochemistry of human tissue that has the capacity to reverse the diseased cell biology model:\n\n\nPilot study: Similar synergy and enhancement of therapeutic response and improvement of quality of life in end-stage cancer has been noted.\n\n\nSubject composition therapeutics is a product of bio-chemical engineering of cell/tissue immune functionality. It has the anabolic design of human tissue (and other mammalian tissue). \n\n This therapeutics provides the pharmacodynamics of cell and tissue healing, repair and regeneration with significant anti-inflammatory activity and reduction in chemical mediator chemo-attractant inflammatory cytokines, such as but not limited to IL 1 , IL 6, and\n\n\nTNF. This therapeutics stimulates interleukin receptor antagonists of inflammation, uniquely associated with the stimulus of protein synthesis in healing.\n\n\nSubject therapeutics composition immune therapy stimulates protein synthesis tissue healing, anti-inflammatory efficacy represented here by mimicking human tissue and immunologic 'self with the use of bio-chemical equivalents of human tissue. Additionally, the precursor micronutrient microenvironment also mimics human tissue immunologic 'self. All these components have additionally been screened as to not cross the immuno- inflammatory surveillance barrier. As immunologic 'self, these components are biochemically invisible to the immuno-inflammatory surveillance system, the basis for their significant tolerance. This subject composition therapeutics activates the patient's own stem cells, in promoting healing and regeneration of tissue, along with activation protein synthesis with anti-inflammatory activity reducing inflammatory cytokines and associated chcmo attractant activity. This therapeutics also activates antagonist to inflammatory receptor interleukin (ILlbeta) and associated activation of the immune protective system. The therapeutic subject composition approach that corresponds to the activation of the genesis of the embryonic stem cell shown above such as:\n\n\n1. Organizational cell membrane phospholipids\n\n\n2. Activation of the organizational protein synthesis system by use of L amino acids in protein specified by the genetic code, in stimulating the protein synthesis production of targeted protein such as developmental protein mimicking human tissue's breast milk protein. 3. Activation of the extra cellular matrix system with the use of ECM components such as, but not limited, to glycosaminoglycans, collagen, cartilage, chondroitin sulfate, glycoprotein and proteoglycan. Subject composition further includes synergistic micronutrient microenvironment, vitamins such as Vitamin A, vitamin D; minerals such as zinc; essential lipids such as and with particular reference to Omega 3 fatty acid fats. These FDA approved-as-safe components have withstood a remarkably significant test of time (from the perspective of drug discovery), and parallel the progressive history of development of biologies such as insulin for diabetes, or Bj\n2\n for pernicious anemia. The opportunity to augment immunotherapeutics in tissue integrity can be found in researching \n\n correctable deficiency studies of biomaterials provided in 19 composition of-matter claims as provided in 6,974,976 B 1. For example, in diabetes, whether type I or II, it is known in type I that there is a deficiency of insulin and in type II a deficiency in the receptor. This receptor has been identified in our research as chromium nicotinate provided for example, in the Carlson Vitamins, Arlington Heights, IL, Super 2 Daily vitamin and mineral soft gel with fish oil and lutein, in a dosage of 200 micrograms and Life Extension Products, Hollywood, FL Chromium Ultra, in a dosage of 500 micrograms). Not only does it improve insulin sensitivity but it also maintains the healthy systolic blood pressure and reduces oxidative stress. Studies in women have been associated with weight control, as well as optimizing and maximizing the subject composition's immunotherapeutic safety and efficacy to advance and normalize the biologic competition and tissue integrity, to augment and restore normalization required to prevent the complications (commonly found in the feet and legs) but not limited to diabetic infections. It is of paramount necessity for tissue healing of diabetic ulcer, as well as normalizing the degenerative changes associated with diabetes. Similar therapeutic response to atherosclerosis, (an important factor in diabetes), has been noted with subject composition.\n\n\nSubject composition therapeutics offers an immunologic-based therapeutics with a broad and diverse range of therapeutic applications, applicable to noπnalization of tissue healing and associated innate immunity and anti-inflammatory activity. These include the reversal of intractable diseases such as, but not limited to, Crohn's disease, wound healing, and immunologic diseases spectrum that includes autoimmune diseases. These immunologic diseases range from the mild to the most severe and extreme. Subject composition therapeutics new cell/tissue immune efficacy and functionality includes traumatic and osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in human and large animals and cancer with its many organ system types.\n\n\nThis therapeutics is similar to existing immunologic-based broad range medication that also focuses upon persistent inflammatory diseases. Subject composition therapeutics is targeted to diseases such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nSubject composition therapeutics and its variants are unique and proprietary, not only in the formulation, but also in the specialized ratios, colloidal emulsion, and balanced hydrophilicity, all derived from FDA pre-approved-as-safe components. Subject composition therapeutics has been defined by the FDA as a drug. It is administered orally in capsule or tablet form, topically in cream form, and intravenously. This therapeutics provides \n\n normalization of the immuno-inflammatory system concurrent with stimulation of healing repair and regeneration of diseased tissue.\n\n\nThis biologic efficiency and proven efficacy has been demonstrated here in more than 247 patients. It does not require a cell culture resource derive from a milieu that requires, e.g. a vat as in brewing beer, nor is this a cell or stem cell-derived product with concerns of variations in cell line.\n\n\nTherefore, it is unlike animal or human derived antibody therapeutics, and does not cross the immuno-inflammatory passive surveillance barrier. Therefore it is free of serious side effects such as lymphoma, tuberculosis or multiple sclerosis. No known undesirable effects including avoidance, or significantly minimizing steroid requirements and dependency.\n\n\nIn fact, after tracking subject composition therapeutics and its progressive development over several decades, no known undesirable effects have been observed. This is attributed to subject composition therapeutics immunochemical medication design, which does not cross the immunologic inflammatory surveillance barrier system. It has a broader immunologic cell/tissue functionality range of enhancement.\n\n\nThe added beneficial therapeutic effects include significant steroid sparing with the added advantage of avoidance or significantly minimizing steroid requirements and dependency. Subject composition of matter lmmunotherapeutics as applied to: Enhancing functionality of vaccines and co-using with advances in cancer vaccines and immunotherapeutics subject composition of matter as a vaccine adjuvant. This results in enhancement of vaccine efficacy and safety in clinical risk management bridging research, development and production.\n\n\n(N.) Coronary Artery Disease\n\n\nSubject composition therapeutics has been useful in the management of coronary artery disease, not only in countering the atherosclerotic deposition of cholesterol, plaques, but also in prevention of fatal dysrhythmia. This pharmacologic mechanism has been applied here as illustrating the dual role of the Omega-3 fats in the management of cardiac disease.\n\n\nThe pharmacologic mechanisms therapeutic effects as components of subject composition therapeutics are related to the essential Omega-3 fatty acid fats and the organizational cell membrane component phospholipid. The unsaturated double bonds in the \n\n 2\nn\n carbons of glycerol esterified to the fatty acid, has been additionally helpful. We have found that the Omega-3 fats have been associated with reduction in blood cholesterol level. The cell biology model of prevention of fatal dysrhythmia with use of the Omega-3 fats fish oil and plankton derived in the beating isolated animal heart muscle, despite the cardiotoxins administered in the experimental model.\n\n\nThe bioelectric phenomena present in all tissue, is highly dependent upon subject compositions therapeutics organizational membrane matrix of phospholipid and Omega-3 essential fatty acid fats. The 3 alternating double bonds of the Omega-3 fatty acid fats generate a very similar pi electron cloud as the benzene ring. These 3 alternating double bonds have the added advantage in that this effect is compatible with this 3-D stereo fit of cell biology models and of human and mammalian tissue. They additionally move as delocalized pi electron bonds along the chain of the fatty acid. These electron clouds can foπn phase boundary potentials like the charges of static electricity in a capacitor. This bio electric capacitor is best exemplified by the phospholipids such as, phosphatidyl choline bilamellar liquid crystal micelle. This static electrical charge on the hydrophilic bilamellar outside layers creates this capacitor static electrical storage effect with the lipid hydrophobic insulating effect separation.\n\n\nThis effect has been used therapeutically, for the prevention of fatal dysrhythmia such as ventricular fibrillation using the animal model in managing atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.\n\n\nThis same principle has been applied therapeutically to treat and prevent convulsions analog to \"cerebral fibrillation\" in the animal and patient that has epilepsy with the use of organizational cell membrane matrix, phospholipid such as phosphatidyl choline.\n\n\nThese essential lipids, as the foregoing, hold oxygen in cell membranes where the oxygen acts as a barrier to microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria and fungi. Also, these essential lipids are involved in making oxygen available for tissues by activating or opening the oxygen molecule in the form of electro-static forces, regulated by sulfur containing proteins. Thereby helps maintain the fluidity of membranes, in association with phospholipid, phosphatidyl choline surface active activity. In addition to dispersing potential toxins to the external surfaces of the body for excretion, they also help all proteins in the membrane by electro-static forces of their double bonds. They are also involved in such functions as the protein cell membrane channels, and pumps. These potentials across cell membranes are important in all cell membrane function signaling systems with particular reference to the \n\n heart, nervous system, and musculoskeletal system. This bio electric signaling phenomena is a component part of the stereo 3-D organizational matrix of subject composition therapeutics. The cell membrane organizational matrix containing phospholipid has another important advantage that of fluidity in enhancing blood flow. This enhancement of transmission of oxygen is therefore effective in treating diseases with potential hypoxia, such as coronary artery disease. An added advantage is a 25% increase in blood flow because of enhanced elasticity of the red blood cell membrane facilitating the passage and thereby oxygenation in these small channeled blood vessels and capillaries when used in dosages of 1.8 grams daily for 30 days of phosphatidyl choline. Additionally, the phytosterols, or plant sterols, such as beta sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol, play a therapeutic competitive role in reducing the level of cholesterol.\n\n\nWith each reduction in homocysteine of 4 mg%, there is a decrease by almost 20% in predisposition to coronary artery disease. This is therapeutically accomplished with subject composition of matter by incorporating B-vitamins such as, folic acid, B-6 and B-12. The present invention thereby sustains and converts the potential abnormal L- amino acid homocysteine to its normal required 3-D stereo format of L cysteine or L methionine, the organizational matrices of the subject composition therapeutics L amino acids in non chiral glycine specified by the genetic code of targeted protein.\n\n\nThe lipotrophic effect of L carnitine appears to be related to its choline-like tertiary amine component with similar effects and surfactant effects such as phosphatidyl choline. This effect in conjunction with co-enzyme Q-10 makes lipids more available for mitochondrial utilization in aerobic metabolism. Co-enzyme Q- 10 has also been found to be useful in reducing predisposition to metastasize and its blood level has been found proportionate to that anti -metastasis factor. (See the following, Anticancer Therapeutics).\n\n\n(O.) Anticancer Therapeutics\n\n\nIt has been found that the compositions of the subject invention can normalize genomic expression, and are adaptable for anti- cancer chemo- therapeutics. The findings are based on utilization of FDA pre-approved as safe components which not only normalize the genomic expression, but also can normalize the abnormal cell cycle of cancer so that the cancer may proceed to scheduled end -of- life cycle and cell death. At first it seems counter intuitive that a safe product should be lethal to any tissue. However, the mechanism of this proprietary composition is to normalize and mimic human tissue or other mammalian tissue \n\n and to normalize its healing capacity. In normalizing cancer's healing capacity, it has found by the inventor that the cancer cell is stuck or arrested in a cycle that does not permit its scheduled apoptosis or cell death. By normalizing this cell cycle the cell is able to proceed to its cell death. In applying subject composition to the anticancer therapeutic applications of subject composition organizational matrices, reversing cancer as illustrated in the 70 examples of apoptotic induction cancer cell death, is associated with the foregoing therapeutic subject composition derived form mimicking human tissue and mimicking human tissue's healing capacity using. . The transdermal therapy is effective in arthritis cited herein in repairing torn rotator cuff and in reversing traumatic arthritis and synovitis in the equine species. When applied in-vitro to a prostatic cancer cell culture the results was an 80% reduction in 24-48 hours of cancer cells mediated by activation of apoptosis. There was up to 99 to 100% human cancer cell lethality even though these biochemical component equivalents to human tissue were FDA approved-as-safe. 8 clinical cases of cancer all improved in terms of reversal of the severe fatigue in as short of time as 24 to 48 hours as shown in the cancer example cases. Also, the reversal of cancer tissue in the 7 to 10 day acute experiment of examples presented here where 2 of these patients had observable reduction in cancer tissue size. One patient, over several months' treatment, had objective CAT scan and PET scan findings of reversal of lung metastasis with complete reversal of this metastasis as observed by comparative follow- up PET scan. One patient with a superficially anal lesion followed with physical examination that included palpation was observed to have a 40 % reduction in anal cancer cell size in the 10 days of IV treatment with therapeutic composition of matter. Treatment was focused on normalizing the Hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (HLB) an effect that all of the organizational matrices liquid crystal of cell membrane polar surface active lipids, including the L phospholipids such as in phosphatidyl choline. The L amino acids in the molar ratio of targeted proteins of subject composition, comprises and includes developmental protein, such as, but not limited to, breast milk protein. The extra cellular matrix liquid crystal hydrophilic surfactant activity comprises hydrophilic component functionality moieties, such as sulfated and glycosylated polysaccharides, in addition to the protein's hydrophobic CH\n2\n chains. This hydrophobic component of the surfactant effect resides in the protein's 2, 3, 4, or 5 CH\n2\n hydrophobic chains, of polymerized amino acid monomers, comprising the synthesized proteins. This comprises the 1 to 3 sulfate bonds per 2 disaccharide components of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) similar to the sulfate found among the highest hydrophilic \n\n surfactants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, and the glucose molecules added by glycosylation by the cytoplasmic Golgi apparatus.\n\n\nThe analog cell biology model for the pharmacodynamics and pharmacologic basis for this unique application is exemplified as follows. Example of an anticancer therapeutics cell biology model and basis for therapeutic advance in treatment: The initial study of comparative microscopy of (1.) remarkably similar configuration of the characteristic cell of cancer with the lipophilic micelle liquid crystal configuration when adjacently placed for comparative study. It is believed this colloidal emulsion technology domain structural geometric microscopic configuration that the foregoing lipophilic micelle and characteristic cell of cancer phase; also share (2.) functional biophysical colloidal emulsion technology parameters. These commonalities appear to offer a cell and micelle biology therapeutic opportunities in reversing and normalizing the enigma of cancer tissue and its clinical consequences.\n\n\nThe therapeutic concept of reversing the highly lipophilic functionality to a progressively more obverse hydrophilic colloidal emulsion technology state, provided a therapeutic working model to study this significant therapeutic potential opportunity in-vitro and in-vivo. Additionally, the colloidal emulsion technology biophysical parameters illustrated in diagram 1, figure 1, were found useful to direct successful therapy in a disease with formerly very pessimistic poor prognosis therapeutic opportunities. This has been further established providing the selectivity potential for a non invasive therapeutics to enhance the therapeutic response and prognosis in diseases that now include cancer.\n\n\nOf 70 studies of the foregoing 247 clinical and preclinical studies, representing 44 bio-chemicals, 27% (12 of 44) demonstrated a 3-D bio-chemical trend. This trend is also cυmputerizable and provides positive therapeutic results, killing in excess of 88% of cancer tissue within 24 to 48 hours. Five (5) of these studies demonstrated a cancer cell kill rate of 99% to 100% in the same time frame. This is particularly noteworthy since these results were achieved using FDA pre-approved-as-safe components comprising subject composition therapeutic synthetic cell-like micro-environment therapeutics.\n\n\nIncluding additional data of hydrophilic components in their entirety represents therapeutic subject composition components. The additional 2, as seen in the enclosed in- vitro anticancer study example tables of 73% and 83% efficacy, would increase the yield of this drug discovery study to 12 of 44, or 31%. It is even more significant when one considers that these organizational component matrices of therapeutic composition of matter are being \n\n used here synergistically. Therefore we would expect a synergistic anti-cancer therapeutic efficacy based on the progressive development of this anti-cancer therapeutics as presented here.

McGraw Hill, New York, US & Oxford, UK. 2001 p.256-257; herein incorporated in its entirety by reference.\n\n\n\"Metabolic trauma associated with addiction\"\n\n\n\"Amino Acids. The CMS contains uniquely high concentrations of certain amino acid, notably glutamate and gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA): these amino acids are extremely potent in their ability to alter neuronal discharge. However, many physiologists were extremely reluctant to accept these simple substances as central neurotransmitters. This reluctance was based in part on conceptual problems of how to discriminate amino acids acting as transmitters from the same compounds acting as precursors for protein synthesis.\" \"the dicarboxylic amino acids produced excitation and the monocarboxylic ω-amino acids (e.g. GABA, glycine, β-alanine, taurine).\" \"Glycine is the most abundant amino acid with inhibitory activity found in the ventral- quadrant grey matter of the spinal cord, and concentrations of glycine drop in proportion to the degeneration of ventral-quadrant interneurons following transient ischemia of the cord.\n\n\nIn addition to maintaining normalcy and supply quantity of free amino acids as neurotransmitter precursors in the cerebrospinal fluid is optimized and maximized. This is also the case for the adjacent tissues of the gray and white matter of the brain, spinal cord and the cranial nerves as well as the nervesderived from the spinal cord and their sheaths. The free amino acids are also available for supply of proteomics and the normal proteomic array of protoplasmic nervous system protein. This, in turn, is derived from the templating and signaling system of the patient's genomics. This represents normalization, through the subject composition therapeutics which normalizes the polymerases enzyme proteins of DNA and RNA. In the same fashion, components of subject composition amino acids supply the ribosomal system at their entry point through transfer RNA. As a result, the cytoplasmic proteins are formed at the site of the free ribosomes. In addition, the endoplasmic reticulum ribosomes produce the secretory proteins. It is believed that the foregoing therapeutics reinforces anabolic metabolism of the nervous system and provides a normalized cycle of proteomics and associated proteins. This includes, but is not limited to, the normalized polymerases DNA and RNA resulting in a more normalized cycle of the genome and genomics. This is believed to minimize the lack of control addiction qualities of a patient \n\n addicted to drags With the use of this therapeutic composition, this belief is reinforced with similar findings suggestive of normalizing the abnormal genomics associated with predisposition to cancer. See for example the first twenty of one hundred and nineteen articles of research from the National Library of Medicine. In the first six articles, two of these cancer and drug associated articles provide a very clear cut relationship:\n\n\n1. (Brooks PJ, Enoch MA, Goldman D, Li TK, Yokoyama A.

However, the molecular basis underlying the abnormal synapse morphological and physiological changes in the morphine- induced dependence, withdraw, and relapse is not well understood. As prefrontal cortex (PFC) is one of the most important brain regions, which provides executive control over drug use and is severely impaired in many addicts, systematic analysis of the biochemical and molecular alteration of synaptic fraction of PFC in morphine-induced neuroadaptation is necessary. In this study, differential protein expression profiling of synaptic fraction of rat PFC based on morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) model was performed with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Our results showed that a total of 80 proteins were differentially expressed by 2-DE analysis during three phases of CPP assay. Of them, 58 were further identified by mass spectrometry. These proteins were classified into multiple categories, such as energy metabolism, signal transduction, synaptic transmission, \n\n cytoskeletal proteins, chaperones, and local synaptic protein synthetic machinery according to their biological functions. Our study provides a global view of synaptic-related molecular networking in PFC under morphine- induced dependence, withdraw, and relapse, indicative of a concerted biological process in neuroadaptation under chronic morphine exposure.)\n\n\nApplicable to diseases resolution in regard to neurologic trauma such as spinal cord injury and quadriplegic the reversal of glycine deficiency included in subject composition to be included in the further applied research of these neurologic traumas. This therapeutics includes the use of advanced proteomics in protoplasmic protein advanced healing therapeutics in conjunction with redirecting the persistent and aggressive immuno- inflammatory system resulting in a significant increase in an ti -inflammatory receptor antagonists along with equivalent decrease of inflammatory protein interleukins (cytokines). This FDA approved therapeutics is steroid sparing/substitute. Further evidence of the most advanced principles of proteomics applied to immunotherapeutics would be IPFs immunotherapeutic agent (IA). As a result, this therapeutics is immunologically privileged and adapts well to crossing multiplicity of species barriers as well as disease cell lines.\n\n\nThe practicalization of reversal of neurological disease and normalizing homeostasis are provided in the deficiencies our research includes; drug addiction associated with spinal fluid amino acid abnormalities that further include the findings of a pathogenic deviant of amino acid metabolism homocysteine with the implication of the use of subject composition immunotherapeutics in normalizing homocysteine and homeostasis of free amino acid and non-chiral glycine and potentially helping to reverse clinical findings and reestablish normal metabolic homeostasis of tissue of addiction in association with abnormalities of spinal fluid included individually itemized but not synergistically presented in composition in 75 research study publications and blood studies of amino acids further in more than 3,000 similar research study publications again without the synergy of subject composition guided by mimicking human tissue. These articles include disease such as but not limited to Parkinsonism, narcotic, alcoholism and depression in addiction in assessing the dopaminergic and glutamine ergic balance (all conditions when personal control mechanisms are diminished as well as persistence of compulsive addictive behaviors as well as neuro- pharmacologic factors that contribute to the development of this addiction). It is believed that \n\n subject composition will play a therapeutic role in helping to overcome drug addiction, relapse, drug abuse, neurobiology of drug dependence and relapse. See Figure 11.\n\n\nThese components in their synergistic totality mimicking human tissue are representative of molecular embryology which we have found to be equivalent to tissue regeneration and disease resolution. Wc can see these components active in the progression of activating the stem cell (the sleeping egg) and EMC in tissue formation. First the phospholipids such as phosphatidyl choline are made more surface active at the site of injection of the sperm into the ovum phospholipid PC cell membrane and the phospholipase base acrosome. Thereby, one fatty acid arm has been removed and the ratio of hydrophilic** to lipophilic is balanced, or HLB hydrophilicity is increased greatly to H (hydrophilicity) of 2 to L (lipophilicity) of 1 into H (hydrophilicity) of 1 to L (lipophilicity) of 2, with an obverse HLB of 1 to 2. There is now only one fatty acid lipid molecular arm and one hydrophilic phosphocholine molecular arm. This activates the protein synthesis proteomic ribosomal system to now in 3-5 minutes after fertilization to show for the first time that amino acids radioactively tagged such as methionine are being incorporated into proteins. In 1-2 hours tissue is formed wherein the extracellular matrix formed and its glycoproteins, glucosamine glycine, chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine sulfate, hyaluronic acids, fibronectin, collagen, such as but not limited to laminin and fibronectrin. Filtered away as has been experimentally in the sponge the cells fall apart only to reform this extracellular matrix and become unified cells and tissue again in a few hours (1-2 hours). This glycoprotein has been glycosylated in the Golgi and sulfated for strength as sulfated polymer of nylon Kevlar becoming analog to bullet proof material for a vest. This component give the tissues the added tensile strength up to 42% greater than controls when used here as a synergistic component in healing. This can not be done by and inert glue only this matrix can contain information and organization of cells which we have stated is important not only for growth and development but for wound and disease healing the focus of this therapeutics. This extracellular matrix directs organization attachment differentiation due to the information it contains as well as signaling. Hence, this subject composition represents not only a stem cell stimulus but also a stem cell growth factor. This has been expressed by PTO approval and registration of these trademarks which explain this therapeutic activity such as Stem Cell Repair Kit, Cell Bio Chem Repair Kit and Syntheticell. Another term we have used and explained in the introduction of this text is the proteomic array. \n\n This multiplicity of action of each of these components can be seen for example in the amino acids because they represent in addition to the foregoing synthesis of protein components that have neurotransmitter ability such as the inhibitors the monocarboxylic, amino acid, gamma-aminobutyrate, glycine, alanine and taurine. The excitatory factors include the dicarboxylic amino acids such as glutamine.\n\n\nIn the case of breast milk which has replaced the placental feeding of the embryo and fetus. Particularly, noteworthy in the human is responsible in synergistic association with the other components of subject composition to impart progressively to the newborn so that at age one the newborn can now walk and talk. This is not the case for animals that have all of their neurologic skills at birth or maybe 15 minutes after birth such as the colt and calf. In fact the newborn represents a normal physiologic equivalent to quadriplegic (representative of the Christopher Reeve's Syndrome) as in the newborn infant child is not even able to raise its head until three months. At three months the child can raise its head, six months the child can sit up, at nine months pull up to a stand and at twelve months it can initiate talking, crawling and walking. It is believed these principles should be considered neuropathogenesis and treatment of autism, since autism frequently appears at age one, the common age of weaning from breast milk. This breast milk is represented here in the molar ration Ic: a plurality of amino acids having an alpha carbon, the amino acids being present at a molar ratio which is characteristic of human breast milk protein, and wherein nor more than 10% of the amino acids are in D-form. Breast milk also has phospholipid such as phosphatidyl choline and actual cells and tissue additionally represented by the extracellular matrix and micronutrients of vitamins and minerals of subject composition.\n\n\nThis now allows us to better appreciate the amino acids and the neurotransmitter activity as well protoplasmic protein and proteomics healing activity. It has been estimated that nearly 90% of the brain catecholamine are synthesized directly from tyrosine.\n\n\nThe aromatic amino acids, tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine which can be respectively converted to serotonin 5 hydroxytryptamine, which is five hydroxylated and decarboxylated tryptophan This conversion is dependent upon adequate presence of B6 and magnesium and is interfered with insensitivity to insulin. Phenylalanine (and/or tyrosine) can be hydroxylated to dihydroxyphenylalanine which in turn can be decarboxylated metabolically in the body to dopamine which is mainly dihydroxyphenylalanine can be converted to neuro-epinephrme and when methylated can be converted to epinephrine. Acetylcholine provides a source of free choline pool from which the neurotransmitter \n\n acetylcholine is synthesized and may be derived from enzymatic hydrolysis of lecithin and sphingomyelin.\n\n\nIn molecular embryology neurologic development or neurulation has been found to be dependent on the extracellular matrix in addition to its importance of making tissue adherence signaling organization migration possible (in contrast to inert glue like matrix). Since this process can be arrested by surgical removal or cellophane isolation of the extracellular matrix from the rest of the embryonic tissue. These macromolecules are permitted to be released through the Millipore filters., In fact, one on can see the this vine- like extracellular matrix glycoproteins growing into the rest of the tissue through this porosity of the Millipore filter. In fact the life itself of the starting embryo can be arrested by removing the mesodermal EMC wedge between the ectoderm and endoderm. When reinserted surgically, signaling is reestablished and life returns. In embryonic development EMC presence prevents the arrest of gastrulation and neurulation. It is believed applicable in the same fashion to gastrointestinal and neurologic disease resolution. When one considers these developmental features it become imperative to include this biochemical features and synergism of subject composition along with the micronutrients serve as antioxidants, coenzymes and catalyst wherein the minerals with such functions as serving as catalyst and the vitamins serve with such catalytic protein enzyme capabilities included in their function such as coenzymes. This instrumentation that we have shown through CRI (Cambridge Research Institute) is dependent upon liquid crystal hydrophilicity and its associated biophysical features of birefringence of polarizing light. It is believed that this can be a marker for normal tissue in contrast for example to cancer (in that cancer has the lipophilic micelles). This foregoing hydrophilicity can be used as a detectable measuring stick of normal tissue activity by polarizing light probe using polarizing fiber optic cables to carry the light from the polarizing probe serving as a mini polarizing microscope that is heated to 37 degrees centigrade and will carry this light message to the computer chip adapted to read quantitatively the degree birefringence luminescence. This serves as a non-invasive tracking system for therapeutic comparative efficacy of medication and minimizes the need for animal studies as well as serving as a non-invasive equivalent to biopsy in the case of cancer.\n\n\nTissue might be considered analog to an alloy and this analog of the biophysics of human tissue measure with the instrumentation we proposed might be compared to the tone bell alloy of copper. When copper contains 10% tin it has been continually observed that it \n\n has the greatest tone qualities as a bell. The ratios and synergy including the birefringence light response might be considered analog to tone bell copper and the beautiful sounds of the tone bell copper bell.\n\n\nEach step represents a cell biology model of the normal process of the biochemistry of human tissue that has the capacity to reverse the diseased cell biology model:\n\n\nPilot study: Similar synergy and enhancement of therapeutic response and improvement of quality of life in end-stage cancer has been noted.\n\n\nAdditionally, this high degree of anti-cancer therapeutic safety, along with anticancer therapeutic efficacy, is emphasized here. These results are derived from components based on mimicking human tissue through the use of biochemical equivalents of human tissue that are all FD A pre-approved-as-safe. This is therefore contributing to anticancer therapy based on these cell and micelle models and at the same time significantly reducing the risk, if any, in the use of these compounds in the management of cancer. If we include all the components so directed by using therapeutic subject composition, as they also have hydrophilic activity and associated anti-cancer activity, then we have an efficacy that starts with 73% anti-cancer activity.\n\n\nIn the case of the organizational extra-cellular matrix bovine collagen, derived from bovine tracheal cartilage, or cartilage derived from the shark, possess the anti-cancer activity of therapeutic subject composition. The foregoing bovine cartilage has an 80% anti-cancer efficacy in 24-48 hours cancer cell kill efficacy.\n\n\nThis anticancer activity cell-kill efficacy of 0.125 % (polysorbate 80) Tween 80 of 76 % is also similar to the 83% anticancer cell-kill efficacy of precursor L amino acids and glycine, grape seed extract in the molar ratio of developmental protein, which enhances the structural and functional completion of neurologic and other organ development from newborn to infant age one. L lysine, the highly hydrophilic amino acid component of the foregoing amino acid molar ratio of developmental protein, and has a 99 to 100% anticancer kill rate. When used synergistically with organizational cell membrane matrix component of therapeutic subject composition of matter of egg yolk phospholipid emulsion 1.2% diluted 1 :80, there is an anticancer efficacy of 88 %. With the added advantage of these components being FD A pre-approved-as-safe, significant anti cancer therapeutic potential arises.\n\n\nThe foregoing is statistically significant particularly if you consider the fact that the current technology of early stage drug discovery utilizes comparative biochemical structures and through computer search commonly requires 3 million studies so that one single \n\n chemical might be found to provide anti-cancer healing activities. If we add the criteria of drug discovery used in the development of this composition of matter into the computer search, the yield would be even significantly less. For example, to achieve this degree of safety, another computer search would have to be superimposed. This would further include a track record of safety over several decades as in this subject composition of matter. Therefore the yield of available compounds would be significantly lessened. If the criteria of the computer search further included simultaneously mimicking human tissue and immunologic 'self as biochemical equivalents of human tissue and its micronutrient and microenvironment of immunologic self, this would significantly lessen the yield of potential new compounds derived from computer search in contrast to inventive therapeutics derived by replication of human and other mammalian tissue\n\n\nAssociated liquid crystal micelle parameters, are seen in diagram 1, figure 1, of a colloidal emulsion. In addition to these analog geometric microscopic configurations, associated parameters of the characteristic cell of cancer and lipophilic liquid crystal micelle geometric microscopic configuration, associated parameters are seen in the foregoing diagram 1 figure 1. These associated parameters, of anticancer hydrophilicity such as: the higher hydrophilic lipophilic balance mathematical ratios (HLB) of 8 to 10, as is the case of the organizational cell matrix of therapeutic subject composition of matter such as phospholipid phosphatidyl choline (Bilamellar) approximate HLB 8 to 10 with an anticancer kill rate effect 88% in 24 to 48 hours in-vitro study. This concurs with a reduction in cancer size in the 10 day acute experiments as seen in the most superficial anal cancers treated of 40%, using the bilamellar phospholipid hydrophilicity with an HLB in the range of 8 to 10.\n\n\nThis is in contrast to the lipophilic micelle of HLB of 6 or less whose micelle is characteristic of cancer. Additionally, the cancer cells have a characteristic deficiency of hydrophilic phospholipid evidence by the complete absence of the nuclear membrane and its associated nucleolus and nucleolar membrane. This is further evidenced by the condensed DNA chromatin characteristic of very prolonged mitotic changes characteristic of cancer (not seen by the histopathologist in normal instantaneous mitosis required for cell cleavage throughout the body). These phospholipid deficiencies are believed to be detectable with newly proposed polarizing light instrumentation.\n\n\nIn the case of the even higher hydrophilic surfactants, with even more concentrated, and effective, anticancer activity, the HLB is greater than 13 to 20 and 20+. These in-vitro 24 to 48 hour, anticancer kill rate effects are 98% or greater using high hydrophilicity \n\n surfactants, such as Tween 80 or Tween 65, with a concentration of 1%. In the case of the highest hydrophilicity, 20 to 20+, the effects are 100% anticancer kill rate, using a concentration of as little as 0.25%, such as sodium lauryl sulfate. These hydrophilic parameters are further described by the highly hydratcd and highly packed surfactant surface density. This is expressed as the surfactant packing parameter density of 0.5 to 1 as in the case of the cell membrane phospholipid. This indicates the greater packing parameter providing the smaller denser micelle than the lipophilic micelle, which has an index greater than 1. The surfactant packing parameter of the liquid crystal micelles with the most concentrated anti-cancer cell kill efficacy has the greatest surfactant packing parameter efficacy indicated by the smallest micelle indicated by a packing parameter of less than 0.5. This is the case of the highest hydrophilicity surfactants with a very high hydrophilic lipophilic balance ratio (HLB) of greater than 13 to 20 and 20+ (as depicted in diagram 1, figure 1.) The mathematical ratio is provided here for the mathematical formula of surfactant packing number). The surfactant packing number derived from the mathematical formula Ns = WIa\n0\n where (v) and (1) represent the volume and length of the lipophilic hydrocarbon chains and (a) is the area of the hydrophilic polar group. These ratios and mathematical formulas are emphasizing the repulsion between the uncharged surfactant coated surfaces and depend on the hydrophilicity of the surfactant and packing density. At the surface, a well balanced emulsifier should be well hydrated and packed densely on a surface in order to give rise to strong repulsive hydrophilic hydration anionically charged forces. These hydrophilic surfactant parameters explain and characterize the bio physics of the anticancer kill efficacy proportionate to increasing hydrophilicity and microscopic aggregate geometry and the associated hydrophilic parameters. (Ia) I have found when water was added to the surfactant system, such as this egg yolk phospholipid surfactant system, it became more effective in the result anti-cancer activity, increasing the interfacial surfactant system surface. This hydrophilic surfactant further activates the enzyme catalytic system, therefore in accelerating these reactions, it has catalytic function to the enzymatic catalyst for the enzyme catalyst, specific for designated substrates, such as the caspaces critical for the apoptosis dissolution of the cell (Not found in the prior art). The cancer cells, as seen in diagram 1, figure 1, are the histopathologic examination of the characteristic cell of cancer, such as, but not limited to, breast cancer cells that have metastasized to the spinal fluid. All types of cancers have this characteristic cell. It \n\n is believed to be amenable to this fluid histopathologic examination with the arrows pointing to the cancer cell.\n\n\n(Ib) This therapeutic hydrophilic surfactant efficacy can be synergistically reinforced by the other organizational matrices. This comprises the L amino acids and glycine specified by the genetic code of developmental protein such as, human breast milk. The anticancer kill rate efficacy is 83% in a 24 to 48 hour in-vitro study. The highly hydrophilic L amino acid surfactants such as L Lysine, has an anticancer kill rate of 99 to 100%. These L amino acids and glycine have comparative HLB values which can also be programmed from a hydrophilicity standpoint. These pre-protein amino acids are specified by the genetic code of the therapeutically targeted protein, and used accordingly in specific molar ratios, also specified by the genetic code.\n\n\nAdditionally the extracellular organization matrix ECM also has hydrophilic HLB features such as the hydrophilic glycosylated carbohydrates, (glycosylated in the Golgi apparatus of the cytoplasm). Also these ECM components such as GAG (glycosaminoglycans) and proteoglycans glycoproteins are made further hydrophilic by being sulfate, (also analog to the sulfate in the most highly hydrophilic surfactants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate with the highest possible HLB of 20.\n\n\n(Ic) Regardless of the type of cancer, the cell characteristic of cancer is microscopically studied and compared with the colloidal emulsion technology of the microscopic characteristics of its micelle. I unexpectedly found very similar structural morphology of cancer with the lipophilic micelles\n\n\n(2.) Characteristic of cancer: missing any nuclear organizational cell membrane consisting of phospholipid phosphatidyl choline, without a nucleolus and its nucleolear membrane organizational phospholipid phosphatidyl choline to form messenger RNA (mRNA) templated from nuclear DNA.\n\n\n(3.) Since condensed DNA chromatin has also been found to be characteristic of cells destined for apoptosis cell cycle, it is believed this cancer cell is also scheduled for apoptosis.\n\n\nHowever, it is 'stuck' and not able to complete the programmed cell death or complete its cell apoptosis. This is in keeping with cancer being deficient in the self limiting apoptotic cell cycle mechanism, also limiting excess proliferation of cells characteristic of cancer.\n\n\n(4.) Utilizing these three featured inter-relations regarding cancer it was thought by exposing the cancer cells to the hydrophilic surfactants shown in the upper 2/3 of diagram 1 , figure 1, as seen in the bilamellar phase and in this small spherical aggregate phase of \n\n extreme hydrophilicity and associated parameters, that this would alter and normalize the characteristic cells of cancer. This is analog to the structure and associated parameters as seen in diagram 1, figure 1, of the lipophilic micelle and its associated parameters. This is also analog in structural appearance to the characteristic cell of cancer. It has been found with 71 pre-clinical in- vitro studies and about 15 clinical that these FDA pre-approved-as-safe hydrophilic surfactants are representative of a treatment for cancer. The examples of these anti cancer therapeutics results derived there from are shown here.\n\n\n(5.) These hydrophilic surfactants are used therapeutically in subject composition in order to modify the structure, and therefore the function, of similar lipophilic liquid crystal type of micelle aggregation and associated parameters shown in diagram 1 figure 1. It is believed these findings have been noted in biologic emulsions such as human tissue. The hydrophilic surfactants studied in these examples, such as the components of subject composition, including the phospholipids as phosphatidyl choline therapeutically, enable apoptosis through polar surface acting hydrophilic surfactant phospholipid lubricant activation of micro-surfaces. This enables more intimate contact of substrate with hydrolytic enzymes such as caspase, to enhance their efficiency in the completion of this normal process of lethality to the cancer cell. It has been found that the compositions of the subject invention can cause a reduction in the tissue cell count of the cancer cells This occurs, it is believed, because of the proteomic production of the capsase enzyme therapeutically stimulated with subject compositon. The normal cell cycle of apoptosis as a result of the production of associated caspase enzymes, which has achieved in-vitro studies utilizing the HeIa cells (derived from the cancer cells of Helen Lane). 83% to 99-100% lethality has been determined by spectro-photometric studies as well as microscopic studies. All while adding normalization of flow to other cells and cell cycles. This will normalize the tissue flow and function of these liquid crystal structures including normalizing the structure and function of the condensed nonfunctional nuclear DNA chromatin (represented here as a product of the chromatin condensing factor) that all cell cycles have in common, including apoptosis.\n\n\n(6.) We have shown that hydrophilicity of surfactants therapeutically reverses the lipophilicity, and thereby increases hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) to 8 to 10. The cancer cell corresponds to the lipophilic micelle shown in this diagram with HLB of less than 6 along with other parameters shown on the diagrammatic chart. The more hydrophilic bilamellar phospholipid surfactant action therapeutically reversed these histopathologic cells \n\n including the cell characteristic of cancer as evidenced by the enclosed laboratory studies of these comparative cancer cells and equivalent micelles.\n\n\n(7.) This lipophilic micelle had the structural 3-D stereo feature of the characteristic cell of all types of cancer. Therefore, the conclusion of the experiment was to utilize hydrophilic non-lipophilic micelles and their associated parameters. This comprises hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (HLB) of 8 to 10 as in the bilamellar micelles and the more hydrophilic micelles with an HLB of 13 or more, such as Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) up to 20 HLB and, such as sodium lauryl sulfate. All having an HLB in excess of 6 or less, characteristic of lipophilic micelle and corresponding associated surfactant packing parameters and numbers and mathematical formulations. It was felt through incorporating this biochemical insight, offered by this colloidal emulsion technology domain, that the histopathologic characteristic features of cancer could be reversed, non invasively regardless of the type of cancer. It was believed the associated cell cycles of mitosis, as well as the cell, could be normalized so that the characteristic cell did not appear as if it were 'stuck'. It was also believed the characteristic cell would be enabled to proceed to this enzymatically mediated apoptosis. It was found here to be further catalyzed by administration of these hydrophilic surfactant to achieve apoptosis and dissolution of the cancer cell non-invasively. This anticancer kill rate in 24 to 48 hour in-vitro studies were confirmed by spectrophotometric. and microscopic studies, comparative to no change in the control. All of this is being achieved by mimicking human tissue's immunologic 'self. This has been referred to as \"tidy\", since immunologic 'self and this therapeutics subject composition biochemical mimicking therapeutics also represents immunologic 'self. Immunologic 'self stresses biochemical 'invisibility' in that there is no biochemical or biophysical foreign chemical stimulus to produce inflammatory cytokines. Therefore this would be an induction of a life cycle such as apoptosis without inflammation.\n\n\n(8.) With continued analysis of the foregoing hypothesis and results, it was found that each step represents a cell biology model of the normal process of the biochemistry of human tissue. It also, has the capacity to reverse the diseased cell biology model all with DNA chromatin condensation commonality and the associated cell cycle that corresponds to these models such as apoptosis. This normalization by hydrophilic surfactant of the subject composition therapeutics as indicated in the foregoing has the ability to enhance the interfacial association of enzyme and substrate. Thereby, enhancing in a catalytic like \n\n fashion, efficacy of enzyme dependent apoptosis through this pharmacologic mechanism of surface interaction of substrate and enzyme.\n\n\n(9.) Apoptosis and programmed cell death are normal components of the life of cells and tissues to keep a homeostatic balance of genetically determined required cell population. For example, the life of the gastrointestinal track cells has been found to be 2 to 6 days. Apoptosis offers programmed cells death and re constitution of these cells and tissue. This utilization of apoptosis for the normal shaping of tissue may be exemplified in all phases of life, such as embryogenesis. Without the biochemical hydrophilic surfactant enhanced enzymatic shaping of tissue, normal apoptosis to counter webbed fingers, would not be possible. This was addressed by a molecular embryologic apoptotic removal of this webbed finger bridge. A continually recurrent cell cycle is necessary in maintaining normal cell and tissue vitality and cell count. This adaptation mechanism is being used in subject composition therapeutics offered here in an analog fashion as anticancer treatment and/or as an augmentation. It is believed this cell removal technology may minimize the need for cancer surgery and radiation oncology.\n\n\n(10.) Further review of the apoptotic inducing activity of these hydrophilic surfactants, shows a positive correlation to their cytotoxic activity. This hydrophilic surfactant effect also shows a close connection between reversing the highly proliferative cancer cell growth inhibitions and inducing apoptotic programmed cell death. It is believed that cancer also represents dedifferentiation to the highly proliferative phase induced by the maternal or \"early cleavage\" histones.\n\n\n(11.) This stage and cell cycle correspond to the cancer dedifferentiation and represent the mechanism of the extreme proliferation found in cancer and characteristic of the first 10 hours of embryogenesis from the fertilized egg to the 1,000/2,000 cell blastula stage of the developing embryo. There is a dramatic drop in mitotic index and associated cell proliferation that is characteristic of late or embryonic histones, present all through life and identical to adult histones as part of the chromatin DNA complex. (Molecular Embryology, J. Brachet and H. Alexandre, Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, 1986, page 96, Figure 43 & 44).\n\n\n(12.) The enzymatic metabolic phase of subject therapeutic composition initiates the union of the cell membranes of the egg and sperm in amphimixy. Fertilization also activates the conversion of the metabolically 'sleeping' egg and sperm whose inactivation had been dependent upon DNA chromatin condensation, absent nuclear membrane, and nucleolus. Additionally, resistance to enzymatic digestion has been observed by the molecular \n\n embryologist whose experimental findings include resistance to nuclease enzymatic activity. This resistance to enzymatic digestion as with the nuclease enzyme is also noted in the sperm. This sperm is a precursor cell to the embryonic stem cell formed by the sperm fertilizing the egg. Both of these observations are believed to imply a deficiency of hydrophilic surfactant and suggestive of a lipophilic HLB and associated packing numbers that we have found characteristic of the lipophilic micelle and the cells characteristic of cancer. The resurgence of metabolic activity deactivates meiosis or mitosis and makes more hydrophilic in reversing the DNA chromatin condensation. This is seen within a few minutes after fertilization. The sperm's phospholipase fertilization activity removes one fatty acid arm of the phosphatidyl choline and makes it more hydrophilic. This is associated within a few minutes of initiation and onset of utilization of free amino acids as in subject composition, which also initiates protein synthesis. Protein synthesis and its stimulus by therapeutic subject composition, includes the formation of DNA polymerase and the formation of more DNA. These metabolic events maintain hydrophilicity and synergize enzymatic and metabolic activity. (J. Brachet and H. Alexandre, Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, page 100.)\n\n\n(13.) It is further believed, in view of the progression of cell/tissue biologic events, subject composition therapeutics organizational cell membrane matrix, polar surface active lipid hydrophilicity, provides an anticancer therapeutics. The present invention is believed to be mediated through the pharmacologic mechanism of enhancing the hydrophilicity of mitotic changes of cells characteristic of cancer, that we have observed in-vitro, and in- vivo. Therefore, it is further believed that this subject composition therapeutics appears to greatly reduce the high mitotic index and high proliferation of cells associated with cancer. Additionally, we can better appreciate why these patients within 24 to 48 hours in the acute experiment of 7 to 10 days duration had resurgence in energy and did not want to go to the hospital or hospice. Such patients wanted to go home. It is believed that the activation of these metabolic events also activated aerobic metabolism in contrast to the anaerobic metabolism associated with 1) cancer, 2) mitosis and cleavage (1 and 2 having in common DNA chromatin condensation, absence of nuclear membrane and its organizational matrix phospholipids, such phosphatidyl choline, and absence of nucleus so that it is not possible for DNA, RNA, protein synthesis to occur). All of which are activated by therapeutic subject composition and its hydrophilicity. 3) bacteria and therefore bacterial infection, 4) In fact, this turn-off of enzymatic metabolic activity and aerobic oxygen consumption has been repeatedly observed by Zeuthen and occurs even at the end of every normal mitosis. This \n\n mitotic occurrence, associated with normal cell cleavage, is very momentary in humans and mammalian tissue, since this event is rarely seen histopathologically, except in cancer. This anaerobic phase has been associated with an increase in carbon dioxide and decrease in pH (J. Brachet and H. Alexandra, Springer- Verlag, New York, NY, page 91-92, quoting Zeuthen work on page 91 -92, including a tabulation of his work in Figure 39, page 92.)\n\n\nThe anaerobic respiration in contrast to its normalization in cancer with this therapeutic composition, can be better explained by the fact that only 24,000 calories of energy are produced by 2 moles of energy bearing ATP during this anaerobic phase, whether by cancer cells, or bacteria. These 24,000 calories were released by splitting. In aerobic metabolism, almost 20 times more calories of energy are produced:\n\n\n432,000 calories are produced by 36 moles of ATP. Actually, 24,000 additional calories are produced if we add energy released by splitting 6 carbon glucose into two 3 carbon molecules of lactic acid. The final thermodynamic energy calorie release is 456,000 calories per gram molecule of energy. This dramatic difference provides good clinical correlation with the dramatic improvement in countering the severe exhaustive fatigue characteristic of cancer. Particularly, end-stage cancer, confirmed clinically by patients' experiencing a normalcy of energy level noted in 24 to 48 hours, after therapeutic subject composition of matter, with the use of hydrophilic surfactant, such as egg yolk phospholipid was administered intravenously. Note: this exhaustive fatigue adds to the depression associated with the prognosis of the disease and it represents the vicious cycle of loss of hope, that in my experience as a clinician, a patient that has a serious disease cannot afford to face. Whereas knowing that they have a very serious disease and that we are doing our utmost to reverse the disease and the symptomology helps in experiencing the removal of this exhaustive fatigue, and provides hope for the patient. There is no way to be completely certain about duration of life, or the time of death in health, or disease. This thermodynamic accounting system of energy utilization was devoted to comparison of the anaerobic prokaryotic cell with the eukaryotic cell found in mammalian and human tissue (see Peil supra).) There was no reference to cancer. This thermodynamic accounting system reference to cancer is novel to the prior art. The microbiologist, Nobel Laureate, Warburg, had observed that the cancer cell was anaerobic as anaerobic micro-organisms and inefficiently derive less than 10% of their energy from the energy sources of food. He further concluded that this anaerobic state was irreversible as in the case with microorganisms. Therefore these clinical findings of subject composition therapeutic reversibility of exhaustive fatigue are believed to be novel to the \n\n prior art. (See Piel, Gerard. The Age of Science. Basic Books 2001 New York, NY. Pages 285-286.)\n\n\nThis is based on the analog cell models of anaerobic bacteria and the anaerobic metabolism of the cancer cell discovered more than 50 years ago by an eminent microbiologist, Warburg (Nobel laureate for this work). At that time, it was thought to be irreversible.\n\n\nIt is certain that the scheme, which is valid for bacteria, is insufficient to explain the regulation of genetic activity in more complex cells or organisms. First of all, the nucleus of the bacteria is of the \"prokaryotic\" type: this means that it is extremely simplified. It is made of a circular thread of DNA, the bacterial chromosome, which is not surrounded by any membrane (a.) as in the cancer cell; (b.) as in the metabolically sleeping egg after maturation with lipid progesterone activation on the cell surface (no activation when lipid progesterone is injected into the cytoplasmic sap).\n\n\nIn view of the foregoing, it is very tempting to utilize analog to anti-bacterial technology analog to anticancer therapy as chemotherapy with induction of necrosis and apoptosis in accord with today's anticancer advances without the ability to discriminate between the healthy cells and the cancer cells except for surgery in early stage cancer.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the nucleus of the metabolically aerobic eukaryotes as are the normal human and other mammalian cells are. These human and other mammalian cells (in contrast to anaerobic cancer cells and bacteria) are normally surrounded by a nuclear membrane or envelope. They further contain RNA-rich nucleoli and its DNA is associated with many different kinds of histone proteins to form the chromatin that is in a loose active non-condensed foπn. Molecules at the nucleocytoplasmic border (absent in cancer cells) where a selection between mRNA which will function as messengers in the cytoplasm and others which will be retained and degraded in the nucleus occurs. Normal templating of amino acids is specified by the genetic code and function as an organizational matrix for protein synthesis. Normal templating and activation of protein synthesis is also associated with cell differentiation. (In contrast to cancer cells and tissue where protein synthesis and differentiation are arrested in cancer in view of the dense DNA chromatin \"stuck\" in mitosis without being able to normally precede to phospholipid activation of apoptosis as in programmed cell death.)\n\n\nThis is similar and analog to the metabolically sleeping egg but actively engaged in meiosis analogue to mitosis with the same characteristic features of condensed non- \n\n templating DNA chromatin, absent nucleolus the source of messenger RNA, absence of nuclear membrane and nucleocytoplasmic border necessary for selective messenger RNA activation and templating.\n\n\nWhereas the fertilized egg by the sperm (the embryonic stem cell) which releases phospholipase which enzymatically releases one fatty acid molecule which makes normal organizational phospholipid even more hydrophilic and within minutes the DNA chromatin becomes functional and templates RNA and amino acid specified by the genetic code polymerization of protein. Thereby, the meiotic characteristics of the dense DNA chromatin, absent nucleolus and absent nuclear membrane are reversed through the hydrophilic surfactant activity of phospholipid to loose active DNA chromatin functional in templating amino acids specified by the genetic code polymerization and protein synthesis essential for normal embryogenesis.\n\n\nThe endodermal cells lining the surface of the gastrointestinal tract and the leukocytes have a cell life of two to six days (without the cancer phenomena of being stuck in mitosis). Their programmed cell death apoptosis proceeds adjacent to normal cells. This effect is very similar to what was observed in the 70 in vitro studies where hydrophilic surfactant such as bilamellar phospholipid of the normal organizational matrix of the cytoplasm, nucleus and nucleolus in cancer cell death which is now believed to be phospholipid hydrophilic surfactant activation of caspases and programmed cell death apoptosis that can occur adjacent to normal cells as such exemplified by the G.I. tract and leukocytes which have a cell life and therefore normal apoptotic programmed cell death of two to six days.\n\n\nThe main factors involved in nucleosome DNA chromatin assembly are the enzyme DNA-topo-isomerase I, and the karyophilic protein nucleoplasmin; both are abundant in the oocyte nucleus. It seems that the DNA molecules are first loose active and noncondensed additionally mediated by the enzyme topo-isom erase I which has all enzymes are activated by hydrophilic phospholipids.\n\n\nIn contrast and in preparation for meiosis and mitosis, it is believed the role of the nucleoplasmin would be to render the nucleosomes insoluble and therefore rendered templating inactive in the nuclear sap environment required for mitosis in all somatic cells or meiosis prior to fertilization in the egg and the sperm.\n\n\nAnalysis of maturation in sea life (Xenopus, experimental test tube of the molecular embryologist Brachet's text of Molecular Embryology) oocytes has led to the discovery of several biological \"factors\" of still unknown chemical nature. The most important is the \n\n \"maturation promoting factor\" (MPF): injection of cytoplasm, taken from a progesterone- treated oocyte a few hours before GVBD, (oocyte nucleus) into a normal recipient oocyte induces GVBD (egg nuclear breakdown) within 1 to 2 hours (maturation initially occurs after lipid progesterone stimulation of the immature egg membrane). The factor responsible for the induction of GVBD resulting in (1.) breakdown of the nuclear membrane, (2.) condensation of the chromosomes, (3.) disappearance of the nucleoli has been called MPF (maturation promoting factor, a factor found in the cytoplasm after lipid progesterone surface of maturation of the oocyte).\n\n\nHowever, when it is impossible therapeutically to separate cancer cells from normal cells after the cancer has spread, the use of the hydrophilic bilamellar phospholipid surfactant activity with an HLB of about 8 to 10 and surfactant packing parameter mathematical formulation of 14 to I\n5\n with a microscopic appearance of a milky colloidal emulsion dispersion of particles has been found useful in the 71 in vitro anticancer therapeutics studies to kill the cancer cells mediated by apoptosis. This is even more apparent using much lower concentrations of highly hydrophilic surfactants which have a macroscopic character of a clear solution and an HLB of about to 13 to 20 and even 20+ and a surfactant packing parameter of V/al less than ½. This includes such surfactants as the synthetic surfactants Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) and sodium lauryl sulfate (Cholase.) which corresponds to the microscopic colloidal emulsion micelle configuration of hexagonal phase, where hydrophilic water molecules surround hexagonally, the lipophilic fatty acid/fat molecules.\n\n\nThis is all in contrast with the reversed diagonal microscopic micelle appearance that is microscopically analog to the characteristic cell of cancer. Macroscopically, there are lumps of emulsifϊer in equilibrium with surplus of water. These coalescence are analog to the tumor like formation not seen in the foregoing lumps of lipophilic emulsifier with HLB of about less than 6; and surfactant parameter V/al of greater than 1.\n\n\nIt has been shown here that subject opposition therapeutics has provided hydrophilic surfactant activity that contributes to reversal of diseases of poor and guarded prognosis now includes cancer supported by the associated pharmacologic mechanisms of disease reversal provided by the foregoing data included in 70 in vitro studies and associated in vivo short- term and long-term clinical studies. Recognizing the deficiencies that predisposed to diseases such as deficiencies in biamellar phospholipid such as phosphatidyl choline are included in the strategy of new drug discovery and subject composition therapeutics enhancement of disease reversal that include cancer. \n\n Adhering to the normal HLB balance is analog to adhering in therapeutics to normal pH acid-base balance. This can be tracked clinically very simply by the use of equipment dependent upon the electrical conduction and conductance of water representing the hydrophilic component and resistance to electrical conductivity representing the lipophilic component of body tissue by the use of readily available scales such as that may by Tanita. This is further by HLB balance in our diets inclusive of adequate phospholipid phosphatidyl choline as included in therapeutics subject composition to prevent deficiency induced predispositions. Biologic competition for absorption of these lipids has been provided in the phytosterols of subject composition such as Beta sitosterol and are provided as phytosterones such as tree and plant derived resins such as gugulipids and available at Nature's Plus, Amityville, New York with a dosage of 500 to 750 mg daily to be incorporated in therapeutics subject composition.\n\n\nIn addition to diet, exercise has the ability in 15 minutes to counter and turn off lactic acid accumulation associated with the temporary reestablishment of aerobic metabolism known as a second wind routinely experienced by cross-country running sports. As seen above useful in adding to the reversal of diseases of poor and guarded prognosis. A therapeutic opportunity is posed here in Parkinson's disease with normalization in animal pre-clinical studies. Comparative new inventive studies with in-vivo proposed instrumentation with MRI to detect correctable deficiencies and to incorporate into inventive therapeutics treatment of neurodegenerative diseases with the further potential of MS and Alzheimer's.\n\n\n(14.) Most importantly, this application technology is directed to non-invasive anticancer therapeutics. The cell biology model in cancer is based on a molecular embryologic model. This was chosen to activate and normalize human or mammalian stem cells through the cell biology model of molecular embryology. (1.) In tracing the cell biology defects of cancer, through this molecular embryology model, it was found that the cancer cell and tissue histopathologically is believed to have dedifferentiated to this earliest cleavage stage associated with first 10 hours of life's highest proliferation and high mitotic index \"early\" \"cleavage\" cell cycle from the fertilized egg to the blastula stage. (2.) Additionally, the dedifferentiation time in molecular embryogenesis corresponded to the pre-implantation time of the embryogenetic developmental stage, in which the embryonic cell mass is finally implanted in the uterus (3.) Implantation requires the development of the placenta, which in turn is required by the blastula for implantation. (4.) The placenta which is derived at the \n\n same as the requirements for blastula implantation time, from the extra embryonic cell mass simultaneously corresponds with the requirements of the blastula for implantation. (5.) This dedifferentiation occurred, it is believed, at the crossroads of the blastula implantation into the placenta. However, it must be emphasized that the maternal uterine chorionic villae play a structural role in receiving the implant extra embryonic cell mass. Some of the placental tissue and protein biochemistry is derived from the uterus and therefore may be in common with normal human tissue. However, after delivery of the baby, the after birth placental tissue is spontaneously removed from the uterine wall. This after birth is associated with blood loss during placental detachment. Therefore, it is likely that all the placental tissue has been completely removed. It is believed that further studies will confirm the belief that this placental protein appears to be unique to cancer tissue and its dedifferentiation.\n\n\nIn contrast, it is therapeutically important to note the sources since we have found that the amnion is derived from the embryonic cell mass.\n\n\nIt is important to stress these different origins in these therapeutic applications such as regeneration of tissue. Therefore, the equine amnion was used in conjunction with subject composition lotion to successfully re-grow skin in equine veterinary care in one of the 25 successful therapeutic subject composition disease reversals as cited here in the equine veterinary case examples.\n\n\nIn addition to this anticancer effect, it is believed that this could act as an anticancer vaccine adjuvant. It is reasonable in using the molecular embryologic cell model, and discovering crossroads of dedifferentiation, we have also discovered a source of protein chemistry that is not present in human tissue. This protein-chemistry source has extra embryologic presence detected by dedifferentiation through cell model biology precursor. The logical consequence of this pursuit has been shown in cancer to be a protein antigen present in the placenta. In so doing a protein antigen, human aspartoaspergillin, hydroxylate enzyme (HAAH) that hydroxylates growth factor EGF domain signaling was found. HAAH is specifically expressed on the surface of all malignant cells and phenotypes of cancer cells. Neutralizing or inhibiting the cell-surface HAAH reverses cancer cells to normal phenotype. HAAH is a true cancer marker with specificity and sensitivity of more than 90%, and passive immunotherapy has been effective in cell and animal models. It is believed this abnormal protein present in cancer is amenable in providing immunologic anticancer vaccine protection. (Hossein A. Ghanbari, Cambridge Healthtech Institute program abstracts, Immunotherapeutics & Vaccine Summit, Cambridge, MA Aug 14, 2008) This would be an \n\n appropriate cancer vaccine protein to adapt this subject composition of matter as synergistic adjuvant vaccine therapeutics.\n\n\nAnother study that was done and reported illustrates a method to determine abnormal proteins in cancer. \"Bracket 's text of Molecular Embryology (Verlag, New York 1986, chapter 4, page 58 performed by Gurdon) The nucleus from human cancer cells, donated to science by Helen Lane referred to as HeIa cells, were injected to sea life egg cytoplasm. Again emphasizing the inventive therapeutics in disease resolution, the therapeutic potency of tissue particularly the replication of embryonic tissue. When they analyzed the new synthesized proteins, it was found that only 3 (of 25) were synthesized by the transplanted nuclei. Therefore, the egg cytoplasm of the sea life (Xenopus) has the remarkable property of re-programming the expression of the individual HeIa cell genes. This might be a useful experiment in discriminating abnormal proteins in cancer, versus normal tissue proteins, as selected by the sea life egg. The embryonic and pre-embryonic phase of life is remarkably resistant to cancer. (Gurdon JB 1981 Xenopus oocytes. Nature, London). In Gurdon' s additional work on the controls exerted by the cytoplasm in nuclear activities, a fit for hydrophilic surfactant therapeutics becomes evident in the management of cancer where the therapeutic goal of normalization of nuclear DNA chromatin function would be desirable use of synthetic replication of tissue obviates the risk of embryonic stem tissue to dedifferentiate to cancer particularly in a cancer prone patient This is demonstrated therapeutically by the 71 in-vitro examples of studying these effects in induction of apoptosis; believed to be associated with the metabolic, enzymatic activation as required in cancer. He first injected into the sea life (Xenopus) adult brain nuclei into the cytoplasm of sea life (Xenopus) oocytes and eggs and obtained the following results: If brain nuclei are injected into full-grown oocytes, they swell (an index of hydrophilic hydration and metabolic enzymatic activity) and synthesize RNA. However, if they are injected into oocytes undergoing maturation, their chromatin condenses and they may even form chromosomes and mitotic spindles. They no longer synthesize RNA, in view of the characteristic features of mitosis, the absence of the nucleolus, the absence of the nuclear membrane (the naturally present phospholipid surfactant organizational membrane essence of nuclear membrane, and its phospholipid surfactant) (J. Brachet H. Alexandre, Introduction to Molecular Embryology, Springer- Verlag 1986, including p.94). This quote is applicable to the energy derived as shown in Leonard S. Girsh, M.D., Lipid Containing Compositions and Methods of Using Them, US patent 2007/0037777 Al, Feb.15, 2007 and details pertinent to energy production \n\n exemplified by anaerobic energy occurring at the end of mitosis and mutagenic diseases such as cancer. This is in contrast to the energy production in disease resolution and resultant normalization and associated aerobic metabolism. (Piel, Gerard. The Age of Science. Basic Books 2001 New York, NY. Pages 285-286 is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety). Title: Surfactant ratios and formulations in selectivity in normalization of cancer cell biology & therapeutic response. Introduction\n\n\nThis anticancer therapy discovery began with the recognition of the remarkable analog similarity of the 3-D configuration of a metastasized breast cancer cell and the lipophilic reversed hexagonal configuration of the micelle of an emulsion. We find here that this is the only surfactant category with macroscopic appearance of lumps of emulsifier in equilibrium with surplus of water, further analog to the lump-like onset of cancer. Also, the following associated surfactant parameters are representative of this cancer anomaly in that this is the only surfactant category with a hydrophilic lipophilic balance\n\n\n(HLB) mathematical ratio of 6 or less, and surfactant packing parameter greater than one. Description:\n\n\n(1.) In- vivo and in-vitro studies indicate that detergent surfactants can reduce the growth rate of cancer and improve the feeling of well being of the patient.\n\n\n(a.) In 24 to 48 hours, 10 in-vitro studies showed an excess of 88% cancer tissue lethality. 3 studies showed 99 to 100% cancer tissue lethality.\n\n\nConcentration of surfactant required to achieve these results were proportionate to degree of surfactant hydrophilicity, measured by hydrophilic lipophilic balance mathematical ratio.\n\n\n(b.) In view of this success and safety, this treatment was also used in- vivo for end stage cancer patients. Therapy was given intravenously every other day for 7-10 days in treating various types of cancer. Within 24-hours all patients experienced dramatic improvement in energy and sense of well- being. One patient had a superficial palpable anal cancer lesion which was observed to be reduced by 40% in approx 7 days. \n\n This anticancer composition is comprised of at least one surfactant wherein the total concentration of surfactant can reduce or eliminate symptoms of disease. This FDA pre-approved-as-sqfe composition using Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) components (in accordance with the code of Federal Regulations, 21) can be administered orally or intravenously to patients with end-stage cancer who suffer from the ravages of disease itself and long term treatment regimes.\n\n\n(2.) Two major components of surfactants have been successfully tested. (a.) Non-lipophilic bilamellar geometric configuration of phospholipid cell membrane surfactants with HLB ratio greater than 8 to 10 and a formula derived surfactant packing parameter of ½ to 1, derived from the formula v/al. V and I = volume and length of the hydrocarbon chains (hydrophobic) a= effective area of the hydrophilic polar group. (This effective area depends on both the actual size of this polar group and forces acting between these groups within the micelle).\n\n\n(b.) Non-lipophilic surfactant category with hexagonal geometric configuration and HLB greater than 13 and surfactant packing parameter of ½ or less. 3. The concentration of surfactant required to achieve these results were inversely proportionate to the degree of surfactant hydrophilicity, measured by hydrophilic lipophilic balance mathematical ratio and directly proportionate to surfactant packing parameter number.\n\n\n4. With all in-vivo studies, there were no adverse side effects. 5. Mechanism of action: This anticancer therapy is targeted to counter the 3-d micelle configuration of the abnormal mitosis of cancer:\n\n\n(a.) As this detailed histopathologic further study of abnormalities in mitosis characteristic of cancer are continued with finding dense nuclear DNA chromatin of cancer to be in a nonfunctional gridlock of density. This is in contrast to the normal loose functional network of normal nuclear DNA chromatin. This dense nuclear DNA chromatin has therefore lost its ability to normally template protein synthesis through the progressive steps of DNA, \n\n RNA utilization of amino acids, in finalizing the polymerization process of templating protein synthesis.\n\n\n(b.) These hydrophilic and bilamellar surfactants counter lumps with surplus of water. (Diagram 1, figure 1 of emulsion technology Kare Larsson, Stig E. Freigbur, Food Emulsions. Potsdam, New York, page 64).\n\n\n(c.) Re-suspending and normalizing the dense cancer cell nuclear DNA chromatin into a fluid functional phase, permits the cell to proceed to apoptosis by normally templating the required enzymes such as caspase.\n\n\nThis reversal to normal is therapeutically achieved by the hydrophilic and bilamellar surfactants respectively.\n\n\n(d.) Respiratory enzymatic proteins under control of DNA chromatin are enabled to go to a more efficient phase at the mitochondrial level.\n\n\n(e.) Therapeutic introduction of cell membrane phospholipid bilamellar surfactants has been associated with normalizing nuclear membrane anaerobic analog to prokaryocyte existence of the cancer cells. It is believed that this peπnits normalization of human mitosis, with its associated normal aerobic respiratory enzymatic protein. This prolonged nuclear membrane free anaerobic analog to prokaryocytic existence in cancer is rarely seen in normal tissue. This now becomes associated with normal aerobic enzymatic protein at the mitochondrial level.\n\n\n(f.) The foregoing observations also offer the opportunity to normalize another discovered clinical con-elation in cancer. Long-term patient care with a predisposition to excessive morbidity and mortality related to the decubitus ulcer pressure sore is further correlated with an abnormally low serum albumin protein level.\n\n\n(g.) Further mechanisms: This emulsified bilamellar phospholipid surfactant with its hydrophilic lipophilic HLB mathematical ratio of about 8 to 10 in contrast to an estimated HLB of six or less in cancer and surfactant packing parameter of 1/2 to 1 offers therapeutic ability to correct the abnormal colloidal emulsion of six or less which it is believed with the evidence presented characterizes cancer.\n\n\nThese forces and effects are possible because of the unique hydrogen bonding that hydrophilic surfactant entrapping of structured water provides \n\n along with electrostatic and Van der Waal forces therapeutically augmented in the presence of these bilamellar, hydrophilic surfactants.\n\n\nConclusion: By providing more hydrophilic surfactants with biochemical and biophysical parameters, obverse to cancer, offered here is an effective, safe opportunity for in-vitro, and in-vivo therapeutic anticancer selectivity. Not only is this applicable for adults, but also for children, where self image and innate immunity are so important. It provides an unparalleled safety that does not interfere with growth and development.\n\n\nIt is believed to be possible that the crystalline asbestos body that is not part of a colloidal or emulsion system may also mediate its carcinogenesis through a mitotic proliferation effect in a similar proposed fashion. A very similar hydrophilic surfactant approach brings about an increase in hydrophilicity starting with the phospholipid phosphatidyl choline. Therefore, subject composition therapeutics may also be utilized in preventing, or actively treating the carcinogenesis associated with asbestosis. These anticancer organizational matrices tested in 14 of the 70 in-vitro examples presented here have shown an efficacy of 73% to 99-100%. When one also includes the subject composition therapeutic opportunity for noπnalization of apoptosis and its associated metabolic enzymatic dissolution of cancer tissue, this therapeutic advance is believed to be very significant, considering cancer being a disease of poor or guarded prognosis. Additionally, since embryogenesis is closely associated with healing, the embryogenetic apoptosis that shapes our fingers in utero seems here to be analog to a preliminary biochemical biorobotic surgical technology, as the net effect of this first therapeutic approach or may be reserved for end-stage anti-cancer therapeutics. An anticancer therapeutics is provided here by the normalization of hydrophilicity of two cell cycles, not only the apoptotic metabolic enzymatic cell cycle; but also normalizing the associated most highly proliferative early cleavage cell cycle.\n\n\nThe foregoing builds upon the microscopic lipophilic micelle, being analog to the microscopic characteristic cell of cancer. This also provides evidence that this inventive finding may be used successfully therapeutically in treating cancer with this subject therapeutic composition of matter. Therapeutic success that can be seen through these working analog biologic models provides a new safe anticancer therapeutics without limitation of the type of cancer, since it is based on the characteristic cell of all cancers. This includes further corroborative studies that are believed to provide basis for anti cancer drug \n\n discovery and testing. This includes testing the acceleration of germination time of plant seeds such as grass seeds.\n\n\nSpecific to anti cancer treatment, novel to the prior art, we find further corroboration that dismembering phospholipid, phosphatidyl choline results in animal experiments of progressive 6 months of inflammatory hepatitis without any evidence of a viral cause. This progressively severe inflammatory hepatitis is followed by 6 months of progressively severe hepatic cancer and death of the animal from cancer. It is believed by removing the choline (depleting the animal of the choline), the animal is left with the lipophilic micelle depicted above and believed to be representative of the \"cancer molecule\". The lipophilicity as measured by HLB, is less than 6. This illustrates that the \"cancer molecule\" is causing a dual dysfunction in impairing fat metabolism and explaining, in a sense, a type of cancer dependent upon an imposition of disturbed function rather than what has heretofore been stressed as a type of cancer. The associated parameters of this geometric morphology are further supported by the corresponding macroscopic appearance parameter seen on diagram 1, figure 1, lumps of emulsion in equilibrium with surplus of water which is suggestive of the onset of tumor mass. Importantly, this macroscopic appearance emphasizes the disruption of the emulsion state of charged particles in equilibrium with trapped water. It is believed that these particulates are in keeping with the crystalline features of mitosis in contrast to the enzymatic metabolic phase of the cell cycle. However, nothing here or in any other prior art, presents the therapeutic subject composition and its components as an anticancer treatment.\n\n\nAlso, it is not surprising that the cancer with the dismembered choline depleted phospholipid involves the liver, since the phosphatidyl choline are particularly important in the metabolism of the fats by the liver. (G. Sackheim and R. Schultz, Chemistry For The Health Sciences 3\nrd\n ed. Macmillian, 1977 page 295). It is further believed through the unexpected findings of reviewing the progression of bio molecular molecules are deviants of normal, such as a lipophilic micelle and its analog characteristic cell of cancer, the abnormal misfolding of the normal nuero protective protein prion (PRPc) mad cow disease (PRPsc). Normal folding seems to be dependent on the variant of the primary proteins, moiety of the random coil (that appears on the diagram of the normal prion analog to a \"pony tail\", (or string of beads) that folds with beta sheets that look more like barrel staves. This is in contrast to HLB of L amino acids, and glycine specified by the genetic code, and on associated hydrophilic HLB factors. (Kinsella's text book, Protein Structure Of Foods, section on protein folding related to comparative HLB of amino acids). \n\n This lipophilic micelle analog to the characteristic cell of cancer and the abnormal misfolded prion protein of mad cow disease both have commonalities: the ability to mediate diseases of poor prognosis, cancer and mad cow disease respectively. The potential ability is believed to be reversible to normal with exposure to hydrophilic polar surface active lipids, as well as the ability to self replicate like nylon polymerization. This self replication is not dependent on the presence of nucleic acid or viruses.\n\n\nIt is believed that the pathogenic molecules, abnormal lipophilic liquid crystal micelles, and abnormally folded prions present the potential for \"infectivity\" like a live organism. Analog in this regard to Koch's postulates (cited below) and reversibility with highly hydrophilic surfactants, utilizing this therapeutics subject compositions, and is unique in these respects to the prior art.\n\n\nHumans can become depleted of choline and develop liver damage when fed purified diets or when fed parenterally with low-chlorine formulations. In choline-deficient rats there is enhanced hepatocyte cell death, compensatory increases in hepatocyte DNA synthesis, and liver regeneration. After 6 months on a choline-deficient diet, foci of preneoplastic. hepatocytes appear in rat liver, and hepatocellular carcinomas occur at approximately 12 months, despite the absence of any known carcinogens. The mechanism for the cancer- promoting effect of choline deficiency is not completely elucidated. Perturbations in important intracellular signaling mechanisms regulate cell growth involving hepatic 1, 2-sn- diacylglycerol concentration and protein kinase C (PKC) activity occur in choline deficiency. The chronic cell death and cell proliferation in choline-deficient liver, with its associated increased rate of DNA synthesis, could cause greater sensitivity to chemical carcinogens. Alterations in the genome that occur in choline deficiency, such as hypomethylation of DNA and DNA damage caused by free radicals, also probably enhance carcinogenesis. We add to this list of mechanisms the possibility that loss of an apoptosis pathway contributes to carcinogenesis in the liver of choline-deficient rats (B. F. Szuhaj,and S. H. Zeisel, ''Choline, Phospholipids, Health, and Disease\" SOCS Press, page 16 along with cited references 86-98 on pages 21 & 22). This subject composition anticancer treatment includes hydrophilic surfactants such as, phospholipid, such as phosphatidyl choline, to also include choline and inositol 250 mg each, (as used in the hearing loss example).\n\n\nAs we have indicated, this also permits for the expansion of the treatment of other diseases through the use of subject composition polar surface active features; not only of more hydrophilic components of subject composition including, such as, but not limited to, \n\n phospholipids and phosphatidyl choline. This further includes amino acids and extra- cellular matrix components that additionally have hydrophilic activity of therapeutic subject composition of matter that we have to date innovatively added to anticancer therapy. This is in addition to the initial observations exemplified by the ratio of lecithins to sphingomyelin sloughed off by an infant into the amniotic fluid may be used as a test for hyaline membrane disease. A ratio of more than 1.5 to 1 indicates that the infant's lungs have developed sufficiently. If less than that ratio, subject composition will be therapeutically increase. In hydrophilicity increase, with the use of polar surface active lipids such as phospholipid phosphatidyl choline, is believed to be a therapeutic approach actively and preventively in the premature infant with hyaline membrane disease. Here, the mother is destined to have a premature delivery. This is particularly applicable since oxygen that we depend upon for survival is lipid soluble and this would normalize the membrane and enhance oxygen transmission much needed in these potential premature infants with potential hyaline membrane disease. This enhancement of transmission of oxygen is therefore affective in treating diseases with potential hypoxia, such as coronary artery disease, with the added advantage of a 25% increase in blood flow. The increase in blood flow is due to enhanced elasticity of the red blood cell membrane facilitating the passage, and thereby oxygenating these small channeled blood vessels and capillaries when used in dosages of 1.8 grams daily, for 30 days of phosphatidyl choline (B. F. Szuhaj, \"Lecithins Sources\", manufactures and usages, page 249) (G. Sackheim and R. Schultz, \"Chemistry For The Health Sciences\" 3\nrd\n ed. Macmillian, 1977 page 295).\n\n\nThe biochemistry of cleavage and the chemical nature of the mitotic cleavage and organizational apparatus (MOTC). (See Figure 6) The mitotic apparatus comprises the spindle, the chromosomes, the centrioles and the two asters. Mazia and Dan succeeded in isolating the whole, intact mitotic apparatus from cleaving sea urchin eggs. Mitotic apparatus is made of a variety of proteins; the major one is tubulin. Tubulin is a globular molecule made of 2 non identical subunits, and undergoes linear polymerization. In-vitro tubulin polymerization is enhanced by addition of other proteins, the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). In the living dividing cell, microtubule polymerization starts from organizing centers (MTOCs), which act like seeds in the growth of crystals. The main MTOCs are Centrioles, (pericentriolar clouds that diffusely surround centrioles), and the kinetochores (centromeres) of the chromosomes. It is believed that polymerization of tubulin starts at these 2 MTOCs and that it progresses by \"treadmilling\". New ubulin molecules are added at the \n\n end of the growing microtubules; others are lost at the opposite end. At anaphase, depolymerization of the microtubules takes place in the central region of the spindle. The dynamics of cell division remain poorly understood. Some believe that anaphase movement of the chromosomes results from an ATP- driven sliding of the microtubles, which would shorten the half spindles. ATP-dependent contraction would draw the kinetochores, and then the whole chromosomes toward the poles. Still, others propose that anaphase chromosome movement is due to a Ca2+ induced depolymerization of the microtubules, starting at the spindle's equator and progressing toward the poles. Several molecular mechanisms might of course cooperate in chromosome separation and movement (J. Brachet H. Alexandre, Introduction to Molecular Embryology, Springer- Verlag 1986, page 94).\n\n\nParticularly important and interesting are the enzymes which exert a regulatory role in the cell metabolism. For example, adenylate cyclase and guanylate cyclase, 2 membrane- bound enzymes, control the intracellular content of 2 cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP. In general, a high cAMP content inhibits cell division and favors cell differentiation and therefore, anticancer effect. This is a very favorable anticancer therapeutic pharmacologic mechanism that can be tracked in subject composition; position in the adaptation cGMP has the opposite effects. There is currently a great deal of interest in the protein kinases, which transfer phosphate from ATP to an acceptor protein. Protein phosphorylation modifies the spatial structure and the electrical charge of the protein. Protein kinases, as a rule, require cAMP, cGMP or calcium ion and phospholipid, as an essential component of subject compositions anticancer therapeutic effect for activity.\n\n\nThe foregoing cyclic AMP has been classified as a second messenger in the G protein important pharmacologic system as a basis for advancing new drug discoveries. These include receptors as enzyme: receptor protein kinases. A modified protein kinase receptor includes several receptors for neurotrophic peptides and the multi subunit antigen receptors on T and B lymphocytes. Receptors with other enzymatic activities are included in the receptor domain structures. The receptors for atrialnatriuretic peptides, and the peptide guanylin, the intracellular domain, not a protein kinase, but guanylyl cylclase synthesize the second messenger cyclic GMP. Ion channel receptors for several neurotransmitters form agonist to regulative ion selective channels in the plasma membrane, termed lygand/gated ion channels, which convey their signals by altering their cell membranes potential or ionic composition. This includes nicotinic cholinergic receptor, the GABA receptor for GAMA, amino butyric acid, and receptors for glutamate aspartate, and glycine. They cooperatively \n\n control channel openings and closings. They span the plasma membrane several times; the G protein couple receptors span the plasma membrane as a bundle of 7 alpha- helices, each with a distinctive specificity for 1 of several of a ½ dozen G proteins. Transcription factors, receptors for steroid thyroid hormones, vitamin D and the retinoid soluble DNA proteins regulate the transcription of specific genes. The cytoplasmic second messenger cyclic AMP is well studied second messenger which include cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, calcium, ions, inositol phosphates, diacylglycerol, and nitrous oxide). (Text book of Medicine J. E Pizzornor, Churchhill Livingstone, 1999).\n\n\nThese cell biology models are analog to the biochemistry of the prion (the variant of the normal molecule in the mammalian or human tissue) in mediating mad cow disease. As seen here, Koch's postulate, this provides insight with regard to the cause of cancer.\n\n\nCriteria for developing inventive therapeutics and instrumentation analog in this inventive therapeutics to Koch's postulates of historical significance confined to developing anti- microbial therapeutics :\n\n\n1.replicating human tissue\n\n\n2.tracking biomarkers of disease\n\n\n3. disease resolution pos-tu-late\n\n\nKoch's p's, a statement of the kind of experimented evidence required to establish the etiologic relationship of a given microorganism to a given disease. The conditions Included are (1) the micro organism must be observed in every case of the disease; (2) ft must be isolated anc3 grown in pure culture; (3) the pure culture must, when inoculated into a susceptible animal, reproduce the disease; and (4) the microorganism must be observed in, and recovered from, the experimentally diseased animal.\n\n\n(P.) Neurologic Disease, Mad Cow Disease\n\n\nSimilar treatment could be used in the management of misfolded protein diseases, such as mad cow disease. This appears to be a pertinent application technology in view of the fact that primary protein folding to secondary or tertiary protein folding is highly dependent upon HLB micronutrient microenvironment. This is the case even though the arrangement of the primary string-like alignment of amino acids is genomically determined by DNA and RNA templating. However, a very important part of the biologic activity, normal or \n\n otherwise, (as in the case of mad cow disease) is dependent on the 3-D final folding of the secondary or tertiary folding.\n\n\nMad Cow disease is transmissible to humans. The normal protein prion molecule is mis-folded. Protein folding is highly dependent upon hydrophilicity, and HLB balance, as illustrated by the impact of the relative HLB of amino acids as shown in prior reference tables. It is note worthy that this random coil of the molecule has the biochemical configuration of a 'tail'. When transformed to Beta sheets, the random coil looks morphologically like staves that compose strips in a barrel. Another analog to this biochemical comparative model of a disfigured normal chemical molecule, such as a protein that is analog to the observations we made regarding the foregoing biologic model, is the fact that this modification makes this disease prion molecule isoform. This is referred to as prion scrapey PRsc, also resistant to enzymatic digestion by proteinase K (Pk). The remarkable similarities here are the resistance to enzymatic digestion and molecular configuration of protein that is dependent upon hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (HLB). This brings on a change in function primarily because of a change in the 3-D structure. These 3-D interfacial fits determine the efficacy of the enzyme such as, but not limited to, caspase, interacting with the substrate.\n\n\nA most significant basis of this invention is the 3-D distinction of the chiral in contrast to the D- amino acids stereo chemical configuration of the L-amino acids specified by the genetic code. (See Figure 7A and Figure 7B. ). Use of therapeutic subject composition in the multiple Enzyme Deficiency Diseases such as, but not limited, to Gaucher's Disease. Gaucher's Disease is an enzyme deficiency lipidosis disease associated with similar lipophilic micelle (as discussed in cancer), where in these lipophilic micelle bodies can be seen as abundant lip-laden granular cytoplasm. Illustration of the biologic activity of a protein enzyme which is dependent on secondary and tertiary folding associated with hydrophilicity HLB. Also, the protein enzymatic catalytic effect upon substrate can also be enhanced by increasing HLB associated amniotic charge and a more intimate interfacial associative interaction. This can be looked upon as catalyzing the protein enzyme catalyst. The BPTI molecule (top) fits snuggly onto the surface of the trypsin molecule (bottom), blocking the active site of trypsin. This figure is from a computer \"docking\" simulation, which closely (within 0.05 mm) matches the x-ray structure of the complex. (See Figure 8) \n\n This subject composition treatment with the use of FDA pre-approved-as-safe biochemical components that mimic human tissue and human tissue's healing capacity can be readily tested with in- vitro, and in-vivo studies as in the case of foregoing examples.\n\n\n(Q.) Neurologic Disease in the elderly illustrated by Parkinsonism, Alzheimer's, and hearing loss (neuro-sensory)\n\n\nThe appropriate therapeutic subject composition can be applied in neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. This therapeutic potential is augmented with this amino acid containing subject therapeutic composition; for example, advancing the treatment of Parkinsonism with an L-phenylalanine derivative lcvo dopa. This same therapeutic potential additionally offered by these aromatic amino acids, such as L tryptophan, augments advances in other neurotransmitter neuro-therapeutics are required with the advantageous use, as a relaxant tranquilizer, in view of the soporific effect of L tryptophan. The L amino acid glycine, such as the aromatic amino acids L tryptophan, mentioned above, and L tyrosine and L phenyalanine, components of subject composition, advances the treatment of diseases of poor or guarded prognosis potential. This comprises disease such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and hearing loss, associated with the neuro catabolic factors of aging.\n\n\nThe aromatic amino acids, tryptophan and tyrosine, produce the neurotransmitter amine serotonin. Where as phenylalanine and tyrosine produce the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and epinephrine, as well as L DOPA (dihydroxyphenylalanine), and when decarboxylated, results in dopamine. Only L DOPA is therapeutically applicable since it can be converted to dopamine in the nervous system. Where as the 3-D stereo fit of dopamine cannot cross the blood brain barrier and enter the central nervous system.\n\n\nThis is also the case in the component subject composition phospholipid phosphatidyl choline. By advancing the neurotransmitter supply of acetylcholine, choline is 100,000 times more active in enhancing the supply of the missing neurotransmitter acetylcholine as in Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nCholine and Inositol have been added to therapeutic subject composition to help advance the care of neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. The immediate metabolic precursor of the neurotransmitter, Dopamine, is transported into the brain by the large neutral amino acid transporter, and permeates into striatal tissue, where it is decarboxylated to dopamine. Since dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier when administered systemically, it has no therapeutic effect in Parkinsonism. \n\n (R.) Male patient in his late 70s with congenital tremor at age 50 of such severity that he found he was unable to continue with his surgical practice of obstetrics. Family history: his mother had similar symptoms of congenital tremor. Our findings of healing and disease resolution based on replication of human tissue biochemically to repair, regenerate disease and damaged tissue that includes neurologic tissue encompasses also replacement of biochemical deficiencies. This was pioneered by the introduction of insulin to replace a deficiency in the diabetes that has with stood the test of time. However, that fact that the diabetic patient does not return to normal provides working evidence that there are probably other associated deficiencies and therapeutically amendable to subject composition. We have shown this direction of advancing therapeutics is applicable in a disease system of neurologic disease as well as in other disease systems. In fact every disease system that we have explored in this fashion has revealed similar confirmatory findings such as the 7,000 articles on the treatment of cancer based on resolving tissue deficiencies. A recent study from Taiwan showed that a breast biopsy confirming cancer was also deficiency in the micronutrient selenium whereas normal adjacent tissue free of cancer was also free of selenium deficiency confirming the thesis of the value of tracking and treating the biochemical inadequacies of disease cell lines and thereby providing healing and disease resolution. This is confirmed by findings such as these provide support for healing using treatment biochemical adequacies to reverse the disease cell line deficiencies. This offers us further confirmation of our original thesis of providing healing by mimicking human tissue biochemically of 6,974,796 Bl . These observations were further based upon our research of human and animal model responses with the bio-material component composition of the subject and related ϊmmunotherapeutics in regard to reversal of neurologic disease. These components include micronutrient vitamin deficiencies such as E, Bl, A, amino acid deficiency, and homocysteine metabolic deviant resulting in a deficient supply of the essential amino acids methionine and cysteine because if lack of vitamins B\n12\n, folic acid, including methyltetrahydrofolate B6 resulting in a lack of methylation of demethylated methionine. Deficiency in cell membrane component, omega 3 fish oil, extracellular matrix deficiency composition of 6,975,796 Bl and in accord with composition tabulated in the 2004 declaration to PTO. (Carlson Vitamins, Super 2 Daily vitamin and mineral soft gel, Arlington Heights, IL). Selenium was tracked in the therapy of burns in a report by Bergcr in 2007 showing that in 20 days the tissue integrity of selenium and its protein enzyme composition was normalized whereas in ten days the activation of \n\n anabolic protein synthesis tracked by tagged amino acids was observed (analog to the molecular embryology of activation of protein synthesis in the sleeping egg when tracked within a few minutes of fertilization).\n\n\nWound Healing and Tissue Repair in Adults\n\n\nTrace element supplementation after major burns increases burned skin trace element concentrations and modulates local protein metabolism but not whole-body substrate metabolism.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: After major bums, patients exhibit an intense catabolism, and the wounds often require surgery and grafting for closure. Complications, such as weight loss and delayed wound healing, are worsened by trace element (TE) deficiencies. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the effects of TE supplements on systemic substrate turnover and local protein metabolism during wound healing after major burns. DESIGN: This was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 21 patients aged 35 +/- 11 y with burns on 45 +/- 16% of their body surface area; 12 had skin biopsies performed on days 3, 10, and 20, and 10 patients underwent a stable-isotope investigation on day 10. Intravenous copper, selenium, and zinc (TE group) or vehicle (V group) was given with a saline solution for 14-21 d. On day 10, [(13)C]phenylalanine (600-mug/kg bolus followed by 12 mug . kg(-l) . min(-l)) plus 6-[(2)H(2)]glucose and [(2)H(5)]glycerol were infused for 6 hrs. to determine skin protein turnover. Biopsies were performed 1 and 6 hrs. after the start of infusion to determine [(13)C]phenylalanine enrichment.\n\n\nRESULTS: The patients' mean ages and burn severity did not differ significantly between the groups or between the skin investigations subgroups. Plasma TE concentrations were significantly higher in the TE group. In the burned areas, the skin contents of selenium (P = 0.02) and zinc (P = 0.03) increased by day 20. The supernatant- to -plasma (13)C enrichment ratio in burned skin was 0.363 +/- 0.094 (TE group) and 0.286 -/- 0.130 (V group) after 1 hr. (NS) and 0.592 +/- 0.153 (TE group) and 0.262 +/- 0.171 (V group) after 6 hrs., which reflected lower catabolism in the TE group (P = 0.03). No significant differences in whole- body substrate turnover were found between the groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION: TE supplementation was associated with an increased skin tissue content of selenium and zinc and with a reduction in skin protein catabolism. \n\n Ataxia with isolated vitamin E deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease due to mutations in the alpha-tocopherol transfer protein gene. In ataxia with isolated vitamin E deficiency, the biochemical hallmark is the low plasmatic levels of vitamin E and, in most of the patients, vitamin E supplementation allows a stabilization of the neurologic conditions. We have investigated the genetic cause of ataxia and reduced levels of vitamin E, and apolipoproteins Al and B in a 16-y-old patient. Results revealed that our propositus is a compound heterozygote for the c.227_229delinsATT/c.744delA mutations in the alpha-tocopherol transfer protein gene, each inherited from one of the two parents. His sister is also a compound heterozygote for both mutations, and she presents a biochemical pattern similar to that of his brother. After receiving the vitamin E supplementation, plasmatic levels of vitamin E and apolipoprotein Al have been normalized in the propositus. The detected mutations would justify the undetectable levels of vitamin E, but would not explain the also decreased levels of the apolipoproteins, as neither that after treatment with vitamin E, the levels of apolipoprotein B do not become normal. These findings suggest that other genes may play a role in producing this atypical biochemical profile.\n\n\nOur previous studies implicated vitamin E deficiency as a risk factor for equine motor neuron disease, a possible model of human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and showed direct effects of this deficiency on brain vascular endothelium. To gain better understanding of the pathogenesis of equine motor neuron disease, we determined the effects of dietary antioxidant insufficiency and the resultant brain tissue oxidative stress on blood-brain barrier permeability. Rats (n = 40) were maintained on a diet deficient of vitamin E for 36 to 43 weeks; 40 controls were fed a noπnal diet. Permeability of the blood-brain barrier in the cerebral cortex was investigated using rhodamine B, and lipid peroxidation was measured as a marker for oxidative stress. Animals on the vitamin E-deficient diet showed less weight gain and had higher brain lipid peroxidation compared with the controls. Fluorometric studies demonstrated greater rhodamine B in the perivascular compartment and central nervous system parenchyma in rats on the deficient diet compared with controls. These results suggest that a deficiency in vitamin E increases brain tissue oxidative stress and impairs the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. These observations may have relevance to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurologic diseases.\n\n\nFolate and vitamin B 12 deficiencies represent important and evolving global health challenges that contribute to the global burden of anemia, neurologic conditions, \n\n neurodevelopmental disorders, and birth defects. We present a review of population-based programs designed to increase consumption of folates and vitamin B 12. A folic acid supplementation program targeting couples prior to marriage in China has led to optimal consumption of supplements containing folic acid and a significant reduction of neural tube defects (NTD). Supplementation programs that use mass community education show some promise, but have not been shown to be as effective as targeted education. The success of supplementation programs hinges on a strong and persistent educational component and access to the supplements. Fortification with folic acid has been shown to reduce the prevalence of NTD in the countries where it has been implemented. Challenges to fortification programs include identifying the appropriate delivery vehicles, setting the optimal fortification level, sustaining the quality assurance of the fortification level, and addressing regulatory challenges and trade barriers of commercially fortified flours. Supplementation and fortification are cost-effective and viable approaches to reducing the burden of NTD, anemia, and other conditions resulting from folate deficiency. The experience with interventions involving folic acid could provide a model for the subsequent development of supplementation and fortification programs involving vitamin B 12\n\n\n(S.) Unilateral Peripheral Neuropathy of the lower extremity following a traumatic injury of lumbo-sacral disc and complications of nerve pressure upon the innervations of the lower extremity unilaterally. These observations were further based upon our research of human and animal model responses with the bio-material component composition of immunotherapeutics of this and related applications in regard to reversal of neurologic disease. These components include micronutrient vitamin deficiencies such as E, Bl, A, amino acid deficiency, and homocysteine metabolic deviant resulting in a deficient supply of the essential amino acids methionine and cysteine because if lack of B vitamins 12, folic acid, B6 resulting in a lack of methylation of demethylated methionine. Deficiency in cell membrane component, omega 3 fish oil, extracellular matrix deficiency composition of 6,975,796 Bl . (Carlson Vitamins, Super 2 Daily vitamin and mineral soft gel, Arlington Heights, IL).(T.) Re: Hypertension Patient in 80s with symptoms of acute dizziness never noted prior, whose blood pressure readings were 160/90 and as high as 190/88 was treated with subject composition of 6,974,796 Bl comprising the following items: \n\n * grape seed extract capsule (1 capsule Ix per day, 300mg, Healthy Origins, Pittsburgh, PA.),\n\n\n• olive leaf extract capsule(l capsule 3x per day, oleuropein content of 6%, 500mg 3x per day, Now Foods, Bloomingdale, IL.) (Ideally oleuropein content should be between 17-27% as available 18% oleuropein content capsule from Oregon's Wild\n\n\nHarvest, Sandy, OR). Discontinued after two weeks because of slight dysarrhythmia (drop beats)\n\n\n• omega 3 fatty acid fat capsule (increased to 2 capsules 3x per day. 750mg/l gram capsule (350mg cicosapentaenoic acid and 250rng docosahexaenoic acid. Carlson Laboratories, Arlington Heights, II.)\n\n\n* flax oil capsule (1 capsule 2x per day, Barlean's Organic Oil, Ferndale, WA.)\n\n\nThe blood pressure readings improved to 120 -130 systolic over 70-80 diastolic (confirmed in both arms). The symptoms of dizziness have not recurred. With stress of blood pressure readings have occasionally increased to 140/88 which improve with a beta blocker drug, Toprol XL (25mg tablet, AstraZeneca. Wilmington, Delaware) V2 tablet daily and Benicar (20mg tablet, Olmesartan Medoxomil-Hydrochlorothiazide) 1 tablet daily to be used if the blood pressure failed to be controlled. (Benicar HCT, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc.. Parsippany, NJ. was contraindicated in that this patient has gout and an elevated uric acid level of 8% with a few percent risk of hyperuricemia. Therefore it was not recommended as a back-up therapeutic). Benicar 20mg daily (Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., Parsippany, NJ.) was added because of increases in blood pressure to 170/90 with stress and after one week blood pressure normalized to 121/68. Toprol was reduced to ¼ to 1/2 of a tablet daily and tapered to every other day for one week and discontinued when pulse did not increase with tapering. (U.) Drug Discovery\n\n\nOf 70 studies of the foregoing 247 clinical and preclinical studies, representing 44 bio-chemicals, 27% (12 of 44) demonstrated a 3-D bio-chemical trend. This trend is also compnteri∑able and provides positive therapeutic results, killing in excess of 88% of cancer tissue within 24 to 48 hours. Five (5) of these studies demonstrated a cancer cell kill rate of 99\no\n/\no t0\n 100% in the same time frame. This is particularly noteworthy since these results were achieved using FDA pre-approved-as-safe components comprising subject composition therapeutics synthetic cell-like micro-environment therapeutics. \n\n Including additional data of hydrophilic components in their entirety representing therapeutic subject composition components, the additional 2as seen in the enclosed in-vitro anticancer study example tables representing 73% and 83% efficacy would increase the yield of this drug discovery study to 12 of 44 or 31%. This is even more significant when one considers that these organizational component matrices of therapeutic composition of matter are being used here synergistically. Therefore we would expect a synergistic anticancer therapeutic efficacy based on the progressive development of this anti cancer therapeutics as presented here.\n\n\nEach step represents a cell biology model of the normal process of the biochemistry of human tissue that has the capacity to reverse the diseased cell biology model:\n\n\nPilot study: Similar synergy and enhancement of therapeutic response and improvement of quality of life in end-stage cancer has been noted.\n\n\nThis high degree of anticancer therapeutic safety, along with anti-cancer therapeutic efficacy is emphasized here in that these results are derived from components bases on mimicking human tissue through the use of biochemical equivalents of human tissue, that are also FDA pre-approved-as-sqfe. The present invention therefore contributes to anticancer therapy based on these cell and micelle models, and at the same time significantly reduces the risk, if any, in the use of these compounds in the management of cancer. If we include all the components so directed by using therapeutic subject composition, which also have hydrophilic activity, we have an efficacy that starts with 73% anticancer activity. In the case of the organizational extra cellular matrix collagen bovine, tracheal cartilage derived of therapeutic subject composition with similar cancer kill rate efficacy to the 0.125 % (polysorbate 80) Tween 80 of 76 %. Precursor L amino acids and glycine in the molar ratio of developmental protein (to enhance the structural and functional completion of neurologic and other organ development from newborn infant to age one showed an anti-cancer kill rate efficacy of 83%. When used synergistically with organizational cell membrane matrix component of therapeutic subject composition of matter of egg yolk phospholipid emulsion 1.2% diluted 1 :80 showed an anti-cancer kill rate efficacy of 88 %. With the added advantage of these components being FDA pre-approved-as-sqfe, significant anti cancer therapeutic potential arises.\n\n\nThe foregoing is statistically significant, since the current technology of early stage drug discovery utilizes comparative biochemical structures and through computer search commonly requiring 3 million studies so that 1 chemical might be found. If we add the \n\n criteria of drug discovery used in the development of this composition of matter into the computer search, the yield would be even significantly less. For example, to achieve this degree of safety, another computer search would have to be superimposed. This would further include a track record of safety over several decades as in this subject composition of matter. Therefore the yield of available compounds would be significantly lessened even more so. If the criteria of the computer search further included simultaneously mimicking human tissue and immunologic 'self as biochemical equivalents of human tissue and its micronutrient and microenvironment of immunologic self, this would even further lessen the yield of potential new compounds. The 3-D stereo fit of organizational matrices, as illustrated in this subject composition therapeutics, is essential in all therapeutic activity, not only for efficacy, but also for safety. Where else could we find such biologic fits besides the FDA pre-approved-as-safe components and their biologic origin of plants and animal derived sources? This appears to account for our 27% yield in search for anticancer efficacy in new drug discovery, in contrast to 1 in 3 million. Cell and tissue ordered repair and regenerative healing are provided in this drug discovery technology as applied to this subject composition that was derived by mimicking human tissue with the use of these 3-D stereo-chemical organizational matrices' integrative fits. This is exemplified by its ability to reverse diseases of poor prognosis, including cancer, without any apparent undesirable effect. Thereby a therapeutic reversal is provided for damaged tissue, and the disorder and entropy of disease.\n\n\nThis also provides a methodology for drug discovery by co-using in the therapeutics of an existing veterinary disease. At the same time this represents a method of drug discovery in animal testing with use in an existing analog disease model. This was accomplished without experimentally producing a diseased model in an animal, representing an ethical and humane advance in drug discovery as well as a significant economic advantage in greatly minimizing the costs that are escalating in drug development by accomplishing two beneficial therapeutic effects at the same time.\n\n\nThis progression of filed and issued patents provides a cell biology matrix with self validating mechanisms of the healing process of the synthetic cell-like microenvironment that industry can build upon through further practicing and advancing this patent. The pharmaceutical industry may benefit from this advantageous position by developing and utilizing therapeutic products thereof. At the same time the pharmaceutical industry will still \n\n find themselves within the fundamental scope, and chemical infrastructure of the matrix of cell biology mediating healing and disease reversal.\n\n\n4. Individualized Therapy To optimize therapy with the present invention, an individual profile of each patient is compiled and stored. Information collected includes blood protein types, lipid levels, DNA sequence, nutrient component levels in the blood including the amino acid composition, and nutrient levels in the cells, tissue and organs. In particular, amino acid composition of organs and tissues is collected. This information may be used to individually design a therapeutic formulation, which includes the L amino acids in molar ratios dictated by the cell and tissue analyses. Furthermore, blood and tissue samples may be stored for future comparative reference.\n\n\nIt would be advantageous to employ computer software that could help identify preferred therapeutic formulation components and their molar ratios based upon a comparison of formulations administered to patients having similar profiles. Also, computer software could be designed to compare the chemical components of particular ribosomes or tissues with the structures of L-amino acids and provide an amino acid formulation that corresponds to the chemical components in their correct molar ratios in a particular ribosome. Ribosomes are the organelles of protein synthesis. Diseased tissue may be chemically analyzed and compared with healthy adjacent tissue to determine the nutrients needed using specially designed software. Nutrient-specific stains such as Coommassie Blue may be employed to identify amino acids, proteins, and other nutrients in tissue samples. MRI spectroscopic analysis and other analyses known to those of skill in the art, may be used to determine tissue and cell chemical composition and thereby discover the deficient nutrients.\n\n\nIt is also envisioned that a medical professional will track the success of the therapy by measuring the chemical components, including the nutrients, in the damaged or replaced tissue during the period of therapy. Such measurements may be made by the invasive practice of tissue biopsy. Preferably when biopsy tissue is removed for diagnosis for another aspect of the patient's therapy, some tissue cells will be used for a nutrient composition analysis. For example, some patients suffering from Crohn's disease may have tissue removed for diagnostic purposes. Such tissue could also be used for a nutrient composition biopsy (with molar ratios). Also, non-invasive methods of measuring tissue or cell composition, such as \n\n MRI spectroscopic analysis, blood analysis, analysis of secreted liquids, and other analyses known to those of skill in the art may be used.\n\n\n5. Diagnostic Methods for Milk Allergies The present invention also concerns a novel method and device for diagnosing milk allergies. It has commonly been supposed that milk proteins and milk sugars apparently acting as haptenes arc responsible for milk allergies. The diagnostic methods of the present invention are believed new because they are based upon the belief that the principal allergens in dairy products are not milk proteins and milk sugars. They are rather the metabolic and catabolic products of bacterial activity and of viral activity, and also bacterial and viral proteins resulting from bacteria, mold and viruses present in dairy products. Thus, testing for allergic responses to bacterial and viral proteins and by-products is appropriate to diagnose and treat milk allergies. Accurate testing for milk allergies would be very useful to allow correct diagnosis and proper treatment of these allergies. Without limiting the invention, it is believed that microorganisms, including bacteria and mold, and viral proteins rather than milk proteins and sugars give rise to milk allergies for the following reasons. First, milk allergies currently are associated with almost 100% negative skin tests when the protein fraction of milk is used as the suspected allergen. It is believed that the carbohydrate and lactose fraction of milk harbors microbial agents and, therefore, this fraction should be tested to diagnose milk allergies. Second, although lactase when added to milk provides milk that does not give rise to allergic responses in many patients, the lactase used commercially is present with unnamed proteases that degrade allergenic microbiologic and viral proteins. Thus, the success of lactase-fortified milk products may be due to degrading microbial and viral protein products rather than degrading milk proteins and milk sugars.\n\n\nWithout limiting the scope of the invention, it is believed that the catabolic and metabolic products of bacterial and viral activity function in at least two ways in the mammalian body. First, such products are believed to drive protease activity in the direction of protein degradation under the law of mass action. Second, such products operate as allergens in sensitive patients. By avoiding foods containing these products, allergies, particularly milk allergies, are treated and allergic symptoms are reduced.\n\n\nTo aid these goals, allergies, particularly milk allergies, can be diagnosed by testing for allergic responses to bacterial and viral proteins, and to catabolic and metabolic products \n\n of bacterial and viral activity. In particular, it is believed that by testing for response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (\"LPS\"), many milk allergies may be diagnosed. Other possible allergens are proteins produced by rotavirus and avian or bovine tuberculosis.\n\n\nThe physical methods of immunological testing are well known to those of skill in the art. For example, an immediate allergic response can be shown in a positive result to a skin test. If a skin test does not show a response, then it may be advisable to inject the skin intradermally to determine if a response occurs. A delayed response may be shown several ways. For example, the patient may notice a response to a skin test 48 to 72 hours after the skin test is administered. Also, the patient may notice coughing or wheezing, or have great intestinal distress 48 to 72 hours after a suspected allergen is contacted with the patient's skin.\n\n\nMore particularly, allergens may be identified by using one of the following diagnostic tests. To test for hypersensitivity to viral proteins and the products produced by viral activity, including rotavirus antigen hypersensitivity, an extract is prepared from the extra embryonic fluid of a chicken embryo infected with the virus. The extract is concentrated and purified by differential centrifugation. The virus is killed with formaldehyde solution ,1 :1000, and is diluted with isotonic sodium chloride solution. The resulting product contains approximately 0.012 moles glycine, and less than 1 :8000 formaldehyde solution. Thimerosal is added as a preservative 1 :10,000. Each ml of the skin test antigen contains 40 complement-fixing units. After shaking, the product is slightly opalescent. The product is administered first as a skin test. If the patient shows no response, the product is administered intradermally, in 0.05 cc and then 0.1 cc dosage if 0.05 cc intradermally is negative. The test, like a tuberculin test, is read 48 to 72 hours after contact with the suspected allergen. The test is also read immediately after the scratch test, and 10 to 15 minutes after the intradermal test.\n\n\nA test for bacterial hypersensitivity may be performed similarly to the example provided for viral hypersensitivity and according to standard methods of making and administering bacterial vaccines and allergenic extracts known to those of skill in the art. Such tests preferably include analyses of hypersensitivity to bacteria common in dairy products and their flora, catabolic, and metabolic products. Tests for hypersensitivity to molds found in milk products may be performed using methods similar to those disclosed herein for allergenic extracts and the knowledge of one with skill in the art.\n\n\nThese microorganism agents in milk allergy are believed to include debris of microorganisms killed by pasteurization, which maintain allergenicity even after the \n\n microorganism is no longer infectious. Preferably immunological testing for milk allergies includes testing for these agents.\n\n\nIt is well known that dairy cattle are exposed to viruses and bacteria, sometimes at high levels, which would give rise to the appearance of viral and bacterial allergens in milk. For example, British dairy scientists found that paratuberculosis spread quickly through water ponds where fecal paratuberculosis ileitis was present. The spread of this disease was limited by using drinking troughs and by raising the pasteurization temperature 3°C. 75°C, from 72°C.\n\n\nAs confirmation of the present theory, it is noted that sheep, whose meat and milk products are much less allergenic than beef and cow milk products, have a low incidence of paratuberculosis. The incidence is as low as 1% in diary sheep. A low allergic response to food from animals with low incidence of viral and bacterial infections is expected under the present theory.\n\n\nThe invention also concerns a device to use in skin tests for immunological responses. In a preferred embodiment, the device is a test unit consisting of a stainless steel disc attached to a handle, preferably a plastic or wooden handle. Projecting from the disc are 4 triangular- shaped prongs (tines), which are 2 mm long and approximately 4 mm apart. The tines have been mechanically dipped into a solution of Old Para- Tuberculin, containing 7% acacia (gum arabic) and 8.5% lactose as stabilizers, and then dried. The entire unit has been sterilized by Cobalt 60 irradiation. No preservative has been added. Because the unit is disposable; there is no need for syringes, needles, and other equipment necessary for standard intradermal tests. The test can be read in 10 to 15 minutes, or 48 to 72 hours later. The unit can be used more safely than these prior art devices and is expected to result in a lower level of accidental needle sticks than found when syringes with needles are used.\n\n\n6. Convergence technology regarding anticancer therapeutics and associated interdependent convergent diagnostic system technology—Polarizing Microscopy:\n\n\nEndoscopic Examination Equipment, Polarizing Microscopy Probe integrating the aid of polarizing fiber optics for transmission of polarized light. Also utilizing the leading advances in polarizing microscopy developed for in-vitro fertilization in studying adequacy of fertilized egg for normal pregnancy.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a probe is attached to standard endoscopic examination equipment, which in turn can be activated to help clarify a question with regard to the lesion \n\n detected. It is believed it might provide not only findings associated with gross inspection endoscopic examination, but also augment the opportunity for detecting malignant (neoplastic potential) screening test. This will be similar to the adaptation of the dissecting microscope about 40 years ago to advance neuro-surgery and particular skull base surgery. Practicalized further and in a further embodiment, a few millimeters of pressure of a vacuum is applied to insure, at that time, imminent contact with mucosa such as, but not limited to gastrointestinal, respiratory tract and urinary tract. Providing a quick noninvasive confirmatory screening test under these drastic circumstances.\n\n\nPolarizing microscopy can be used both with reflected and transmitted light (analog to a diamond). Reflected light is useful for the study of opaque materials such as mineral oxides and sulphides, metals and silicon wafers (Figure 3). Reflected light techniques require a dedicated set of objectives that have not been corrected for viewing through the cover slip, and those for polarizing work should, again, be stress free. It is believed that a significant portion of polarizing light aid in imaging cell biology such as cell membranes and spindle is analog to the polarizing light that penetrates and is further being trapped is analog to the scintillation and shimmering of a multi-faceted diamond. This is further analog to the birefringence light like effect of light trapped in a neon sign.\n\n\nDisclosed in this application is a therapeutic stem cell stimulating, growth factor that has been successfully useful in disease resolution as well as normalizing neuronal flow in pain management. In tracking the biomarkers of disease associated with the development of this growth factor, there has been a progressive development of equipment that would significantly augment the dissecting microscope that has been so skillfully applied in surgery, including robotic surgery and neurosurgery, as well as skull base surgery. This visualization of the biomarkers of disease can be diagnostically used to track therapeutically non-invasive, as well as invasive surgical care including neurosurgery. The transdermal therapeutics and the adapted surgical and neurosurgical equivalent will be used therapeutically to enhance precision of application as well as being incorporated in this instrumentation for non-invasive tracking of therapeutics, as well as surgical tracking non-invasively of the therapeutics of these diseased biomarkers similar to the adaptation for endoscopy to further help identify and distinguish normal tissue from abnormal tissue thereby preventing trauma to normal tissue in surgical care. This will augment the dissecting microscope in surgical and neurosurgical care To be used as an excision of a benign tumor as an acoustic neuroma positioned in a malignant skull base position to provide very cautious microanatomic guidance to prevent \n\n transaction of the normal facial VII nerve, a not uncommon complication of this neurosurgical procedure result in a stroke like interference of facial expression and smile as well as interference of speech.\n\n\nBirefringence is particularly useful in the study and visualization of liquid crystals, particularly those with a hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) of eight or greater, as seen, for example, in the phospholipids. Of particular note is the phosphatidyl choline work significantly pioneered by Neil Krog in studying the molecular embryologic work of egg yolk phospholipid initiated in food science. This instrumentation polarizing microscopy technology can be used in- vivo or in- vitro in tracking such biomarkers as a membrane of human and mammalian cell, nuclear, organelle. In fact it is believed that the nuclear membrane material that provides the birefringence scintillation of the spindle is derived from the now absent meiosis and mitosis (including the abnormal mitosis of cancer) nuclear membrane nucleolar membrane and nucleolus. As well as it is believed its implied absence in the associated dense nonfunctional regard to templating proteomics of protein production. The inventor has used egg yolk phospholipid incorporated in Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL and Baxter Laboratories, Chicago, IL in advancing the potential for disease resolution in the ten day study of end stage cancer with such FDA approved products such as 10% to 20% with 1.2% egg yolk phospholipid Liposyn, Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL or Intralipid, Baxter Health Care, Deerfield, IL (see US Published Application No. 2007/0037777 Al, filed Feb.15, 2007 and U.S. Published Application No. 2005/6, 974, 796 Bl , filed Dec.13, 05, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.) See also Figure 17A and Figure 17B from Larsson, K. and Friberg, S Food Emulsions, Page 158 and 171, 2\nnd\n Edition Marcel Dekker. Inc. New York and Basel.\n\n\nIllustrated in Figures 16A-C is a series of reflected polarized light photomicrographs of typical specimens imaged utilizing this technique. On the left (Figure 16A) is a digital image revealing surface features of a microprocessor integrated circuit. Birefringent elements employed in the fabrication of the circuit are clearly visible in the image, which displays a portion of the chip's arithmetic logic unit. The polished surface of a ceramic superconducting tape (Yttrium- 1,2,3) is presented in Figure 16B. which shows birefringent crystalline areas with interference colors interspersed in a matrix of isotropic binder. Metallic thin films are also visible with reflected polarized light. Figure 16C illustrates blisters that form imperfections in an otherwise confluent thin film of copper (about 0.1 micron thick) \n\n sandwiched over a nickel/sodium chloride substrate to form a metallic superlattice assembly, (see full article at: www.microscopw.com/articles/polarized/polarizedmtro.html)\n\n\nInstrumentation that we have shown through microscopy examples, such as but not limited to those disclosed by Cambridge Research Institute (CRI) in Figures 12A and 12B is dependent upon liquid crystal hydrophilicity and its associated biophysical features of birefringence of polarizing light. Such visualization may be maximized and optimized by visualization technology such as but not limited to polarizing light. Building on the technology of Cambridge Research Institute (CRI), camera-like equipment, such as, for example, that available through CRI, can be utilized to determine the degree of molecular order. One embodiment utilizes the CRI Oo-sight or Lf equipment as a camera with Bectra inform software operably attached via USB cable to a computer, as well as, liquid crystal compensator. This equipment is readily adaptable to an Olympus, Zeiss, or Leica microscope. This is the same equipment utilized by known in-vitro fertilization groups to determine the viability of the in-vitro fertilized egg and in preventing and discarding abnormalities found in in-vitro fertilized eggs. Such abnormalities qualify for destruction, minimizing the risk of multiple births or other abnormalities. In contrast, normal spindle formation observed by polarizing light microscopy has been found to predict the level of normal birth success by as much as 60% to 70%. However, to our knowledge, this technology has never been used to track and understand the pathogenesis of cancer and track its associated mutagenicity. Since the in-vitro fertilization groups using polarizing microscopy technology are able to infer mutagenic changes such as multiple births or other abnormalities, it seems logical and it is believed that the same mutagenic tracking can be used in regard to detecting potential mutagenic changes in observing and studying the vital tissue of cancer (analogous to comparative studies of the cancer tissue with adjacent normal tissue). It is further believed that it is possible to observe and track cancer normalization of the micro-environment treated with the subject composition therapeutics. Therefore, the mutagenic, genomic, and proteomic normalization that ensues also the normalization of the DNA and RNA polymerases and prolonged presence inflammatory changes that have repeatedly been observed associated with not only cancer are normalized, but also the further complications of metastasis. The associated normalization of proteomics would be of great value in tracking and advancing the treatment of diseases such as cancer in a similar comparative way. Subject composition therapeutics includes use of advanced proteomics in protoplasmic protein advanced healing in conjunction with redirecting and normalizing the persistent and aggressive immuno- \n\n inflammatory response system. This results in a significant increase in an ti -inflammatory receptor antagonists along with equivalent decrease of inflammatory protein interleukins\n\n\n(cytokines). This FDA approved therapeutics is a steroid sparing/substitute. It has this been used to track the pharmacology, cell biology and pharmacodynamics of normalizing tissue treated with therapeutics such as, but not limited to, the subject composition. This is a particularly advantageous opportunity since meiosis or mitosis and the associated spindle formation and liquid crystal studies provide such a unique fit in comprehending the pathogenesis of cancer as viewed in our associated subject composition patent filings. This is exemplified by the particular regard of the ability of spindle formation and its believed involvement in the pathogenesis of cancer, and the lipophilic micelle that we have used and believe represents the cancer molecule. This work will provide the basis for a non-invasive technology for obtaining biopsies, with a particular, but not limited to, emphasize on cancers.\n\n\nThe liquid crystal polarizing light message will be transmitted by polarizing light fiber optic cable, (available by such company as Corning), to a computer chip readout of degree of polarizing light birefringence, (a high level of birefringence is a measure of tissue normality), similar to what had been used when developing the Oximeter with Hewlett Packard.\n\n\nAdditionally we know that the penetration of the polarizing light is at least 100 microns. This is based upon the fact that the polarizing light can be used to study and penetrate a human embryo and stem cell with which the technologists have worked. This is in sharp contrast with light microscopy used in histopathology where the tissue must be no greater than 4 microns in thickness to permit light penetration. This addition provides the instrumentation and ability to make vital live tissue available not only for diagnosis but also for study that has not been available in the prior art to date.\n\n\nMaintained at 37°C and immediately examined under a polarizing microscope to augment visualization of tissues, we utilized their associated liquid crystal birefringence as a substitute for tissue staining to permit examination under microscope. This has been done in fertility studies but not other diseased tissue biopsy examinations with particular interest in cancer.\n\n\nThis instrumentation is being planned to be carried out in two centers. Also, non- invasive application technology of augmenting and/or replacing the invasive biopsy is being carried out.\n\n\nAdditionally, the cancer mechanism focused in nucleus and its associated genomic cell divisions that start in the nucleus DNA have chromatin changes mediated by nuclear \n\n spindle formation. It is believed to be locked in cell division spindle formation such as anaphase. This cancer resolution may be visualized under enzymatic apoptotic cancer disease resolution and including subject composition mediated by current and advanced therapeutics. Conventionally and routinely, polarizing microscopy has been confined to solid crystal study and has been used in some centers to differentiate uric acid crystals from calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposits in gout\n\n\nPolarizing light microscopy will allow us to better evaluate structure and function. For example the multiple studies that were done in the cited reference using phospholipids to increase the blood flow by 25%, suspected but never documented, to be due to increased pliability of erythrocyte cell membrane, which can be advantageous in atherosclerosis where blood flow is impeded, would be detectable. We would be able to hereby detect efficacy non- invasively. It is believed this polarizing light microscopy equipment would help to provide vital tissue examination rationale so that we could observe the red blood cell flow through the capillaries. In the suggested reason of increase red blood cell plasma fluidity membrane studies existing studies that have been done have not provided rationale there are not alternation is plasma viscosity, sedimentation rate or other standard blood parameters were not found to be altered. In studying the phospholipids, such as phosphatidyl choline, efficacy of increasing blood flow by 25% we make comparative studies before and after the phospholipid using the more translucent web area of the skin between the thumb and index finger as well as the nail beds to determine practicality. (This is analog to pulse oximetry studies of oxygenated blood.)\n\n\nIt is believed that this can be a marker for normal tissue in contrast for example to cancer (in that cancer has the lipophilic micelles). This foregoing hydrophilicity can be used as a detectable measuring stick of normal tissue activity by polarizing light probe using polarizing fiber optic cables to carry the light from the polarizing probe serving as a mini polarizing microscope that is heated to 37 degrees centigrade and will carry this light message via polarizing light optical cable provided by a company such as Corning, to the computer chip adapted to read quantitatively the degree of birefringence luminescence. This serves as a non-invasive tracking system for therapeutic comparative efficacy of medication and minimizes the need for animal studies as well as serving as a non-invasive equivalent to biopsy in the case of cancer. It can also be used for tracking pharmacologic and pharmacodynamics therapeutic effects on multi-species in pre-clinical animal work and \n\n human clinical pilot studies. This technology applying polarizing light microscopy is not limited to biophysics modality.\n\n\nAt the present state-of-the-art, the only vital tissue that has been exampled we believe to date is the in-vitro fertility studies of the egg and sperm polarizing light microscopy thereby visualizing vital living tissue and its morphology as well as biochemistry. This biochemistry is illustrated by the fact that the essences of cell membranes of living tissue are dependant upon phospholipids such as phosphatidyl choline and its liquid crystal characterizing birefringence. In routine histopathologic stains alcohol toluene (similar lipid solvent and lipid removal chemicals) such as those chemicals analogous to the dry cleaning industry washed away the normal chemical with a lipid component and replaces with paraffin. Therefore this tissue represents an artifact of structure and biochemistry which is consistent and represents the bases such as routine hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE). Also, thin slicing of the four micron thick tissue allows it to be placed on glass and the frozen section for cancer also distorts since it is no longer a live vital tissue. Vital tissue is ideal to track the biochemistry of diseased tissue versus normal tissue and therefore applicable in tracking the biochemistry of subject composition therapeutics. With further sophistication of the technology, micronutrients, vitamins and minerals might also be traceable. Without disturbing current routines, we can use a Touch Prep for histo-cytologic studies, to confirm, for example, the presence or absence of malignant cells which can also be examined as vital tissue under the polarizing microscopy with a heated stage (37 degree Centigrade (98.6 F) normal human body temperature). When adapted to other mammalian tissue the heated stage has to be adjusted to the normal temperature of the animal species (for example certain animals have a normal temperature of 101 ° degree F). Additional tissue has been put aside for HE stain in the case of the frozen tissue section. Small amounts of this tissue can be examined under the polarizing microscopy with the added advantages of vital tissue examination and it associated undisturbed biochemistry. This study will have to be adapted to histopathologic orientation and training as was the case for the neophyte pathologist.\n\n\nThese biophysical features of birefringence are also evident in the extracellular matrix such as, but not limited to, collagen. This is based on hydrophilicity charts of the amino acids (see, for example, the hydrophilicity table on IBD part II, page 26).\n\n\nTissue might be considered analogous to an alloy and this analogy of the biophysics of human tissue measurements with the instrumentation we proposed might be compared to the tonal quality of a bell made of an alloy of copper. When copper contains 10% tin, it has \n\n been continually observed that it has the greatest tonal qualities as a bell. The ratios and synergy including the birefringence light response might be consider analogous to tonal bell copper and the beautiful sounds of the tone bell copper bell.\n\n\nUtilizing live tissue treated with the composition of the subject invention, the effects thereon can be seen with polarizing light microscopy, such as that which has been applied to the studies of human fertility and the ovum. The cancer tissue, of the HeLa cell line, was treated with a composition having some or all of the components disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,974,796, to provide the associated biophysical properties of light transmitting properties of these components, such as, but not limited to, the birefringent luminescence shimmering of light. This biophysical feature of biochemicals that mimic human tissue and its progressive steps in activation of the sleeping egg by fertilization and is also applicable to healing and the principles of using the stem cell as a future therapeutic agent under progressive study for efforts to obtain approval. However, we have presented here in the biochemicals of components IA, IB and 1C, described in further detail below, replicating human tissue and also replicating human tissue healing stem cell capacity stem cell stimulating factor and growth factor as well as the molecular embryologic capacity in proving a cell free variant of human tissue components that serve competitively and synergistically as anti-inflammatory protein synthesis healing agent with the ability to serve as a steroid substitute or steroid sparing agent in healing. FDA approved-as-safe in accordance with the code of federal regulation CFR-21 and without any known side effects to date when used as prescribed along with the micronutrient minerals and vitamins in these progressive patents. All of components Ia, Ib and 1 c are liquid crystals that can be identified by birefringence by using a polarizing microscope with heated to body temperature stage (98.6F). Using the liquid crystal biophysical properties of birefringence under the foregoing polarizing microscopy these light signals should be able to be conveyed by fiber optic cable (ideally a fiber optic cable polarizing light transmitter probe provided by such companies as Coming Glass, Concord, NY). A fiber optic cable polarizing light transmitter and a probe could be provided along with a computer chip read-out whereby it is believed that normal tissue from abnormal tissue can be studied to provide information currently available by biopsy and staining such as H and E (hematoxylin and eosin) tissue with the possibility of certain masking technology. This includes masking out any light transmission from lipophilic micelles characterizing cancer.\n\n\nIsotropic materials, such as gases, liquids, unstressed glasses and cubic crystals, demonstrate a homogenous composition having the same optical properties in all directions. \n\n They have only one refractive index and no restriction on the vibration direction of light passing through them. In contrast, anisotropic materials, which constitute approximately 90 percent of all solid substances, have optical properties that vary with the orientation of incident light with the crystallographic axes. They can demonstrate a range of refractive indices depending both on the propagation direction of light through the substance and on the vibrational plane coordinates. More importantly, anisotropic materials act as light beam splitters, in that they divide light rays into two parts (as shown, for example, in Figure 15). The technique of polarizing microscopy exploits the interference of the split light rays, as they are re-united along the same optical path to extract information about materials, including living tissue.\n\n\nThe birefringence of the hydrophilic surfactant properties of as phospholipids, such as, for example, phosphatidyl choline, and highly sulfated ECM (imparting similar synthesis of healing 42% increase in tensile strength of wound with subject composition treatment. Wound tensile strength increases and is analog to Kevlar (a nylon polymer highly sulfated with bullet proof strength) and it is believed to include hydrophilic surfactant amino acid components of hydrophilic proteins should not only impart a signal or birefringence of polarized light under polarizing microscopy at body temperature of 98 degrees (enhancing equivalent to biopsy findings and availability as non-invasive new instrumentations. This also teaches tracking of biomarkers subject composition immunotherapeutics with polarizing light new instrumentation offered here recovery disease resolution using subject composition therapy. This appreciation of interdependent technology starting with hydrophilic surfactant activity of normal tissue to not only be pivotal to reversing the lipophilic micelle found in cancer but also to reverse cancer's guise as repeated wounds that fail to heal. Also provides liquid crystal birefringence characteristics of liquid crystal highly hydrophilic features of normal tissue components essence of cell membrane with automaticity to biorobotic form cell membrane thereby cells as is also the case with ECM (extracellular matrix) and normal water soluble protein a plurality of amino acids including there of high HLB (see Kinsella, text quote and chart) and particular amino acids in normal molar ratio as human tissue and mammary gland milk equivalent to liquid tissue secretion and its development as a fetus and newborn (in view of articles from the National Archive Library of Medicine for example several hundred articles of deficiencies of micronutrients of such disease as, but not limited to, hypertension). A polarizing fiber optic cable can transmit this probe message of light and total birefringence of liquid crystal components (replicated in 6,974,796 Bl). This can be \n\n utilized for tracking disease resolution for treatment of patients with diseases of poor prognosis. Prior to treatment each patient's disease will be studied and measured by this inventive instrumentation, in terms of disease biomarkers in tracking therapeutic response and disease resolution. This will also be used in tracking as a tissue index of disease, as applied in measuring the degree of cancer predisposition and inability to heal, not only in cancer but also in the inability to heal as in the case of wound healing.\n\n\nComponents of the Composition disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,974,796, exemplified when used successfully in a patient in his early 80s, with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease, associated with periodic tiredness and weakness due to mild mitochondrial deficiency**:\n\n\nLaboratory findings include homocysteine 8 mg. because of the increase to 13 mg. the following modifications were made: * The patient is greatly improved in terms of periodic weakness with the following therapeutics:\n\n\n• Vita Carte 2-4 capsules, 2-3x per day (Phoenix Biologies Inc., Vista, CA.)\n\n\n1.

This can be done with the polarizing fiber optic cable to send a message from the probe to the polarizing light fiber optic cable to a computer chip then the machine measures the degree of birefringence and instrumentation read out of interference of healing and predisposition on cancer.\n\n\nTo clarify, with this technology, it is a possible consideration that further predisposing inadequacies and deficiencies in tissue might also be detected by the birefringence pattern that correlates with bio-chemical polar surface active hydrophilicity associated it is believed with healthy tissue. Therefore an association of selenium deficiency not only in reducing biologic competition thereby allowing not only the influenza virus to prevail but increasing the predisposition to cancer might also correlate with abnormal findings of birefringence. \"There is growing evidence that higher Se intakes are associated with reduced cancer risk. \" \"More recent research has shown that a mild strain of influenza virus, influenza A/Bangkok/I /79, also exhibits increased virulence when given to Se-deficient mice. \" f6,974,796 Bl column 16, end of table 2)\n\n\nIt has been shown in 70 in vitro studies and in about 10 patient pilot studies that through the same phospholipid we can normalize the programmed end of cell life cycle (apoptosis) not only with the phospholipid, but with all the foregoing components of IPFs wound healing therapeutics. This in turn, in primate alcoholic cirrhosis experiments, can be normalized again by use of phospholipids followed by hepatic cellular repair and regeneration. As well as, phospholipid activation of collagenase to replace cirrhotic fibrosis \n\n (documented by Lieber). This is analog to fertilization with the cell membrane's fusion dependent upon phospholipid. The activation of enhanced hydrophilicity by fertilization and sperm injection of phospholipase at the cell membrane site of entry is shown here.\n\n\nThis polarizing light instrumentation that measures birefringence as an index of hydrophilicity in biologic tissue will also give us a quality control 3D analysis of treatment agents analog to typing and cross matching in preparation for transfusion to avoid reactions. This is analog to the quality control polarizing light instrumentation in tracking food science. An example is the stability of an emulsion and colloid system. In fact, this will help us visualize that the body is about 60% water in a colloid system where water is bonded, as well as, an emulsion where water is entrapped from a 3D biochemical engineering standpoint.\n\n\nHLB and surfactant parameters are very difficult studies to do, whereas this polarizing light instrumentation will allow us to spot and check degrees of hydrophilicity by this 3D charged particle suspension analysis. Adding this technology and its computerized readout is believed to enhance and expedite drug discovery that would mirror, replicate and offer a 3D fit of the drug with the tissue implication. It is believed this will change the odds from 1 -3 million in the computer search to our findings of about 1 and 4 of tolerance and therapeutic response. Component Ia: A highly sulfated extracellular matrix:\n\n\nThis component comprises at least one extracellular matrix compound in an amount effective in the damaged tissue as anti-inflammatory and anti-neoangiogenetic agent, wherein said extracellular matrix compound is selected from the group consisting of a glycosaminoglycan, a collagen, cartilage, chondroitin sulfate, a glycoprotein, and a proteoglycan. The hydrophilicity of the extracellular matrix is dependant upon the sulfated proteins which not only add strength an increase of 42% of tensile strength in wound healing but also the biophysical feature of birefringence.\n\n\nCollagen deposition and remodeling are central processes in biology and disease. Conventional methods of visualizing collagen require special stains (trichrome, picrosirius red) and, typically, cutting additional sections.\n\n\nAn optical method (\"birefringence imaging\") developed by CRI and being further modified herein to adapt to the clinical settings and evaluation of therapeutics related to disease and resolution to health biomarkers and can detect collagen because of how this molecule interacts with polarized light. No special stains are required— collagen is revealed \n\n with high sensitivity with standard H&E-stained sections. Combined color plus collagen images can be achieved within 15 seconds\n\n\nThe extracellular matrix components when seen under the polarizing microscope do not require any stain. In fact even though the image in Figure 12A was observed on stained tissue most importantly this study can be observed with the study of unstained live tissue such as seen in Figure 12B, utilizing a polarizing microscope, as seen in Figure 13, plus the added heated stage to maintain the temperature at 98.6 F (37° C).\n\n\nComponent B: Polar Surface Active Lipids: Ib. Another component of the subject composition comprises at least one polar surface active lipid, wherein said polar surface active lipid is selected from the group consisting of a phospholipid, a glycolipid and a lipoprotein.\n\n\nReferring to Figure 1, the lipophilic micelle as shown is characteristic of the cancer molecule viewed here from hystophilology and comparative lipophilicity with an HLB of 6 or less associated with chromatin that is condensed and appears to give the cancer cell the effect of being stuck in its cell cycle and unable to proceed to apoptosis or scheduled cell death. Going \"north\" on the chart where the HLB hydrophilicity is 8-9 of greater we have found in our 71 in- vitro studies HELA cell, donated by Helen Lane, cancer tissue, anticancer studies that the apoptosis and lethality of the cancer cell corresponded to the exposure to hydrophilic surfactant qualities where the cancer cell was able to proceed to apoptosis.\n\n\nAs detailed in Figure 14, the basis for the anti-cancer effect of the phospholipids and hydrophilic amino acid component resides in the surfactant packing parameter and HLB Generally, the repulsion between two uncharged surfactant-coated surfaces depends upon the hydrophilicity of the surfactant and on the packing density at the surface. The cancer cells shown in Figure 14 already exhibit compromised anaerobic activity, which is further inhibited by the surfactant compressible effect.\n\n\nComponent Ic: Amino Acids\n\n\nA further component of the subject composition comprises the twenty free amino acids specified by the genetic code of mammalian and more specifically human tissue that include non-essential amino acids: L-Alanine, L-Arginine, L-Asparagine, L-Aspartic Acid,\n\n\nL-Cysteine, L-Glutamic Acid, L-Glutamine, Glycine, L-Histidine, L-Isoleucine, L-Leucine, \n\n L-Lysine, L-Methionine, L-Phenylalanine, L-Proline, L-Serine, L-Threonine, L-Tryptophan, L-Tyrosine and L-Valine, and their associated protein synthesis and folding and biologic characteristics dependent upon 3D folding configurations and further dependent upon the relative HLB of each of these amino acids in their magnet like attraction a repulsion in forming definitive protoplasmic protein with its biologic activity.\n\n\nProtein Synthesis Matrix and Amino Acid HLB Hydrophilicity Dependent Protein Folding — Basis of Bio-Activity for Compact Disc Software Mediated by Amino Acid Magnet-Like Dipole: The above-listed amino acids function in protein folding as dipolar magnets with forces mediated by the HLB balance, ratios and particle charges where the majority (80%) of essential amino acids are more lipophilic and the branched chain amino acids being the most lipophilic.\n\n\nWhereas, the majority (80%) of the non-essential amino acids are hydrophilic. These in turn fold in accordance with their relative HLB value so that the essential amino acids can be found \"protected\" in the center.\n\n\nThe final folded protein is a lipophilic protein core analogous to a fetus being protected by the surrounding hydrophilic surfactant amino acids. These amino acid components are all liquid crystals with amphiphilic polar surface activity, as described in U.S. Patent 6,974,796, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The amino acid component functions like Component IB and they glycoprotein ECM of Component IA. Additionally, parts of the ECM have a lipid foot anchor to the cell membrane. These glypicans are being similarly composed of amino acids with a hydrophilic signaling the destination directional carbohydrate moiety for each glycoprotein. The relatively high hydrophilic effect so important in wound healing, are also affected by the components recited in U.S. Patent 6,974,796. It appears that the anti-cancer activity of Components I a, Ib, and 1 c is caused by the highly hydrophilic properties, as demonstrated in the 70 in- vitro studies mentioned previously herein.\n\n\nFigure 4 details the bio-activity and resultant effects of protein folding and production in a living body.\n\n\nAll of these amino acids specified by the genetic code of tissue protein arc amphiphilic (with a 2 to about 9 carbon being the most lipophilic exemplified by the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine having three carbon atoms plus six carbon atoms in a aromatic \n\n benzene ring and the amino and carboxyl groups being hydrophilic exemplified by the most hydrophilic amino acids being diamino, arginine and lysine and the dicarboxylic amino acids being aspartic acid and glutamic acid) and are therefore liquid crystals. With it is believed the opportunities of detecting their presence by polarizing microscopy. We therefore, should be able to observe the biochemicals of Components IA, IB, and 1C and observe their activity in healing, molecular embryology as well as detecting abnormal cellular, nuclear activity, extracellular matrix and polarizing microscopy blending further to the opportunity of a probe with these light messages carried by fiber optic cable and tracked by a computer chip so that we can observe abnormalities in structure and function that might include deficiencies such as but not limited to said components, as well as nuclear, cytoplasmic, extracellular matrix distortion of cytoskeletal pattern that is believed to be compositely observable the effects of inflammatory chemicals (such as cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins). It is further believed that this might be traceable using technology analog to the Oximeter, exhibiting convergence of therapeutic technology with diagnostic technology.\n\n\n7. EXAMPLES: The following examples are used to illustrate preferred embodiments of the invention and are not meant to limit the scope of the invention in any way. Case 1. Congenital Biliary Atresia An infant, age 3 weeks, weight 6 lbs. (compared to birth weight of 7 lbs.), was critically ill in a hospital with marked jaundice and abnormal liver functions. The diagnosis was congenital biliary atresia, which was substantiated surgically and the Kasai procedure was performed. A liver transplant was scheduled. A clinical strategy was considered in view of the patient's failure to thrive and the harsh planned therapy. Elemental feedings were prescribed.\n\n\nSpecifically, a free L amino acid powdered composition called Neocate (SHS international Ltd., U.K.) was suspended in water at a concentration of approximately 4 to 6 grams, per 1 ounce of water, which translates into approximately 14 to 16 weight % of free L amino acid, based on the total weight of the solution. This formulation was administered orally to the infant about 3 to 4 times daily (about 4 to 8 hours apart); in 6 to 8 ounce dosages over the period of about 6 to 9 months. Foods having exogenous catabolic substrate stimuli, such as all milk products, arc avoided. \n\n Unexpectedly, the infant exhibited substantial improvement within 24 to 48 hours after treatment began. The jaundice rapidly receded and the liver functions improved. The rapid, dramatic clearance of the jaundice, along with the normalization of hepatic laboratory results was a most welcome surprise. The improvement continued throughout the course of treatment. After about 3 months of treatment, the infant's planned liver transplant was canceled. The liver was diagnosed as healthy, thus confirming that the infant was making a full recovery. The infant rapidly regained the one pound of lost weight and continued normal weight gain, more than doubling her birth weight at six months, and tripling it at one year. At one year, a liver ultrasound showed a completely normal liver. The treatment was no longer necessary after about 6 to 9 months. Over the course of the next year and a half, the infant showed no signs of relapse and all liver functions remained healthy. This is a dramatic case of unexpected remission of congenital biliary atresia, with the patient no longer requiring transplantation.\n\n\nCase Study Illustration: Organ Regeneration Tissue Regeneration and Healing\n\n\nPatient Scheduled for a liver transplantation which was averted with this subject composition therapeutics.\n\n\nRecovery occurred in approximately one month after treatment and on review by the University Hospital the organ transplant was cancelled and both the liver ultrasound and the liver blood studies normalized. See Figure 9\n\n\nCase 2. Anaphylaxis to Renal Dialysis and treatment to prevent the need for kidney transplant An adult patient (age 16) had rejected three kidney transplants and was on dialysis. She had severe anaphylaxis to renal dialysis which was averted by the use of the dialysis membrane which is protected from leaching out made by Renal Systems.\n\n\nTo prevent such an outcome of repeated kidney transplant rejection, the following therapy is used. This would also be of value in preventing the likelihood of anaphylaxis et al. as well as maintaining the micronutrient the microenvironment in countering inadvertent losses that might occur with dialysis focused on reducing and removing metabolic waste products particularly urea. The treatment is the administration of 4 to 5 capsules daily, of L amino acids according to the invention. Each capsule contains 390 to 500 mgm essential amino acids in L form and glycine in the molar ratio of infantile developmental that \n\n mimicked human breast milk protein and included vitamins and minerals such as Neocate, (Liverpool UK) infant formula and essential lipids particularly in omega-3 fatty acid fats. The therapeutic formulation comprises linoleic and linolenic fatty acid for a total amount of about 0.3 to 0.5 g per day, as Norwegian salmon oil (Carlson Laboratories Arlington Heights IL), 1 to 2 capsules daily, the antioxidant lipid EPA at about 0.3 to 0.5 gram per day, DHA at about 240 mgm per day, and extracellular matrix materials chondroitin sulfate, cartilage, and collagen in a total amount of about 1500 mgm per day. An additional extra-cellular matrix (ECM), Heparan Sulfate, a highly sulfated, and highly anionic, ECM, compound is bio chemically equivalent to the basement membrane (ECM) of the filter mechanism of the kidney.\n\n\nThis therapeutics is used to avert the need for renal transplantation. The patient will also able to use reduced levels of anti rejection medication (such as corticosteroids, macrolides, and cyclosporin) and thereby reduce the onerous side effects from these medications. The therapy can also be administered before, during, and after renal transplant to aid in preventing organ rejection.\n\n\nCase 3. Corneal Transplantation\n\n\nPatients requiring corneal transplants are prescribed five, 390 mgm capsules, given 3 times daily of a therapeutic formulation comprising of the following to mimic cyclosporin: 4 moles L leucine, 2 moles L alanine, 2 moles L valine, 1 mole gamma amino butyric acid, one mole methionine, one mole betaine, and one mole glycine. The formulation further comprises linolenic acid and phospholipids. The therapy is used for the patient's lifetime to minimize risk of corneal rejection.\n\n\nCase 4. Kidney Damage\n\n\nA patient needing kidney transplantation is prescribed a 390 mg capsule comprising L amino acids, linolenic acid, EPA (about 0.3 to 0.5 g per day), and phospholipids. The prescription is administered as 1 to 5 capsules, 3 times daily. The amino acid components are present as essential L amino acids in the molar ratio found in healthy kidney protein.\n\n\nCase. 5 Kidney Failure \n\n A patient needing a kidney transplant receives the therapy of the invention. Five 390 mgm capsules are given 3times daily of a formulation comprising linolenic acid, phospholipids, and essential amino acids in the following ratio to mimic cyclosporin: four moles L leucine, two moles L alanine, two moles L valine, one mole methionine, one mole gamma butyric acid, one mole betaine and one mole glycine.\n\n\nCase 6. Corneal Transplant\n\n\nA patient receives a corneal transplant. The patient is prescribed 390 mgm capsules to be taken 3 times daily of a composition comprising linolenic acid, phospholipids, and L amino acids. The L amino acids and their molar ratios are determined based upon a chemical analysis of healthy lens tissue and the diseased lens tissue removed.\n\n\nCase 7. Chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Regional Ileitus)\n\n\nA 68 year-old female patient was diagnosed with Crohn's disease (also known as regional ileitus). The diagnosis was made by small bowel barium x-ray. Diagnosis had also been made by surgical removal of seven inches of terminal ileum twenty years ago. The patient received Neocate.TM. in the form of 5 capsules containing 390 milligrams each, 3 times daily. This was preceded by a course of 155 milligrams of Omega 3 eicosapentanoic acid lipid and 125 mg DHA administered 3 times a week for 2 weeks. The patient had an excellent response with no symptom flare-ups. The absence of side effects is attributable to the therapy, and the ability to avoid increasing the dosage of corticosteroids. The patient continued to receive triamcinolone acetate 4 milligrams daily before, during, and after the inventive therapy. In contrast, the patient had needed triamcinolone acetate dosage increases as frequently as every 3 to 4 weeks before the inventive therapy was administered. After treatment with the inventive therapy, the patient was able to reduce her average daily corticosteroid dosage by a half. Furthermore, flare-ups were reduced. Thus, the severity of corticosteroid side-effects, such as ecchymoses and bruising, were greatly minimized. The unpleasant taste of the therapeutic compositions was overcome by formulating as capsules. Before meals, 5 capsules of the therapeutic formulation were ingested to allow relief from the extreme discomfort resulting from ingesting dairy products and beef.\n\n\nCase 8 \n\n The patient of Case 7 had the commonly seen complications of long term corticosteroid use, such as recurrent and excessive bruising, particularly of the arms and hands, and difficulty of healing from the mildest trauma. Additional therapy of vitamin K (Mephyton 5 mgm) 4 tablets daily was prescribed. An ointment of Neocate (390 mgm), zinc oxide and vitamin E was prepared, and applied topically to bruises daily with a pressure dressing on any lacerations to accelerate healing.\n\n\nCase 9\n\n\nThe patient of Case 3 receives the prescribed formulation in the form of ophthalmic preparations in 0.1%, 1.0%. or 5.0% solutions in buffered saline, 1 to 3 drops administered 2 to 3 times daily. Lifetime usage is prescribed.\n\n\nCase 10. Arthritis\n\n\nA female patient, age 45, was diagnosed with traumatic arthritis of the left knee. No response was shown to non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory medications. For a limp associated with the arthritis, she was prescribed 740 mg capsules, 3 times daily of chondroitin sulfate collagen cartilage (shark source). After several months of therapy, she has greatly improved and almost free of symptoms. Her chronic bronchitis (which had not responded to a three to four week course of antibiotics) greatly improved in 1 to 2 days and cleared in 1 or 2 weeks when the cartilage dosage described in this case was tripled. The following cases and case groups:\n\n\nComparative cell biology studies, since these patent filings, include controls and clinical documentation of diseases of poor or guarded prognosis, totaling 247 patients, 27 of which were equine veterinarian, successful large animal studies. This is inclusive of 70 in- vitro cancer studies, all responsive to subject composition therapeutics that mimic human tissue and is derived from equivalent bio-chemical therapeutics components of FDA pre- approved-as-safe.\n\n\nPreclinical documentation including comparative cell biology controls and clinical documentation of therapeutic sub composition, detailed in examples starting with example 11.\n\n\nCase Group 11. of surgical prc-operative care\n\n\nAbout 100 surgical cases with comparative controls \n\n Intravenous administration in the first 100 surgical patients:\n\n\nWe found acceleration of postoperative recovery wherein the 'B' surgical service patients were able to be discharged a few days earlier than the 'A' surgical service patients.\n\n\nThis amino nutrient intravenous Amigen 250 to 500 ml with ascorbic acid about 250 mg (Mead Johnson, Evansville IL) by therapeutics initiated preoperatively and continued operatively and post operatively stimulated protein synthesis so essential to anabolic healing.\n\n\nThis beneficial effect was also seen in the first child, age 12, female, with heart disease, to benefit from the innovation of the heart lung machine, prior use included only 1 other adult patient. Discharge of patients was hastened and the postoperative prognosis was significantly improved.\n\n\nCase Group 12. Immunologic Diseases: Allergy, Asthma and Autoimmune Disease\n\n\nTherapeutic oral outpatient administration in immunology and allergy care of 30 allergic and asthmatic patients resulted in rapid recovery that more than satisfied Nutramigen a free amino acid formulation prepared by acid hydrolysis of cow's milk hydrolyzed, Nutramigen Hypoallergenic Protein Hydrolysate Formula, Evansville, Indiana, 1 packed level scoop per 2 fluid ounces, 4 to 6 ounces, 3 to 4 times daily, was used as a milk substitute where milk allergy was clinically suspected even though the skin test was negative. Patient's response of complete reversal of allergic disease, allergic rhinitis and asthma was out of proportion to the suspected milk allergy and appeared to be the healing mechanism as seen with foregoing Amigen subject composition therapeutics of amino acids, vitamins (minerals included herein in this infant formulation).\n\n\nThis was illustrated again, in a severe drag reaction patient with false lupus. Characteristic findings of pericardial effusion were diagnosed by ultrasound, chest x-ray and abnormal anti-nuclear antibody titer of 1 to 2600, characteristic of false lupus erythematosis (pericardial involvement is present in 60% of false lupus erythematosis in contrast to about a 10% incidence in true lupus erythematosis), all precipitated by the unusual reaction to an antibiotic. These pericardial effusion findings and laboratory findings cleared in three weeks with a variant of the foregoing therapeutics. The treatment included Cartilade 4 to 5 capsules. 3 times daily (Cartilade, Ontario, Canada, formerly BioTherapies, Inc., Fairfield NJ.).\n\n\nCase 13. Pericardial Effusion, Auto-immune Immunologic Disease \n\n A 70 year old male was diagnosed by cardiac ultrasound, and chest x-ray, with pericardial effusion (an autoimmune reaction). He was prescribed a three week regime of the antibiotic Biaxin (500 mg tablet twice daily for persistent bronchitis, Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, 111.). He was also diagnosed with a false lupus autoimmune reaction to the antibiotic. The patient was removed from all other medications and received the following therapy: cartilage in the form of Cartilade, three 740 mg capsules, 3 times daily; EPA, 360 mg capsules once daily; an Omega-3 anti-inflammatory fatty acids. In three weeks, his fever and fatigue lessened. His blood sedimentation rate improved dramatically from 75 mm per hour to a normal of 15. His antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer also greatly improved to 1 dilution titer above normal (1 :320). His chest x-ray and ultrasound showed no pericardial effusion. The increase in sedimentation rate as a time honored index of disease as thermometry. This rapid fall in red blood cell sedimentation of 15mm per hour to 75mm per hour in this case is associated with an increase in immunoglobulin 1-2600 his antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer as well as an increase in fibrinogen which responds to the stimulus of healing, protein synthesis activation of templating and the metabolic cell cycle providing not only essential protoplasmic protein but also essential enzymes such as DNA and RNA polymerase that provide the cytoplasm normalization and enhancement of genomic nuclear expression and anti-inflammation that further include stimulation of the normal protein enzyme necessary for apoptosis homeostatic modulation of the body's cell population and normalization of metastasis also a complication of persistent, aggressive inflammation predisposition in the case of cancer. More recently in the case of obesity felt through the same mechanism to normalize homeostatic modulation of the body's cell population provided by the bio-materials of subject composition with maximized and optimized efficacy and safety when presented as therapeutic synergistic composition chemical claims such as 6,974,796 Bl . This is a case in all components exemplified herein.\n\n\nIn cases that fail to heal (Part II page 13 of failure to heal secondary to steroids and/or NSAID) are commonly associated with reduced of serum albumin levels associated with malnutrition inflammation and serious liver and renal disease. Which responds to the stimulus of healing, protein synthesis activation of templating and the metabolic cell cycle providing not only essential protoplasmic protein but also essential enzymes such as DNA and RNA polymerase that provide the cytoplasm normalization and enhancement of genomic nuclear expression and anti-inflammation that further include stimulation of the normal protein enzyme necessary for apoptosis? In the case of healing a wound that failed to heal \n\n with subject composition we have found a significant decrease in the need for debridement and normalization of metastasis predisposition in the case of cancer in homeostatic modulation of the body's cell population. More recently in the case of obesity felt through the same mechanism to normalize homeostatic modulation of the body's cell population provided by the bio-materials of subject composition with maximized and optimized efficacy and safety when presented as therapeutic synergistic composition chemical claims such as 6,974,796 Bl. This is a case in all components exemplified herein.\n\n\nCase Group 14. Arthritic Musculoskeletal Diseases, intractable and not responsive to prior therapy Therapeutic oral and local administration application to intractable and not responsive to prior therapy, of arthritic musculoskeletal diseases pilot study of 13 patients of therapeutic subject composition mimicking human tissue and derived from components of FDA pre- approved as safe.\n\n\nThese patients with intractable arthritic musculoskeletal disease include 6 clinical human cases, and 7 pre-clinical large animal equine veterinary tendonitis and synovitis arthritis induced by trauma, not responsive to conventional equine veterinarian management. All seven animals studied and treated completely responded within one to two weeks to subject composition therapeutics topical applications to the joint with complete return of functional activity of the joint. The 6 human cases include non-surgical reversal of the need for prescribed prosthesis.\n\n\nCase 14 (a.) Knee Replacement\n\n\nKnee replacement was prescribed for a 65 year old male. He already had a prosthetic knee replacement. The second knee replacement was being scheduled. Surgery was also averted with use of subject composition oral therapeutics. His knee pain and range of motion normalized. This patient progressively responded to subject composition's therapeutic, (topical therapy was not available at the time of initiation of subject composition oral therapeutics). Subject composition therapeutics was administered with some immediate response in the next few months. Over the next several months, noπnalization of range of motion occurred. This treatment consisted of 2 to 3 Shark cartilage capsules 2 to 3 times daily, (Cartilade Ontario, Canada, formerly BioTherapies, Inc., Fairfield NJ.).\n\n\nCase 14 (b.) Arthritis of the hip joint, averting the knee for hip prosthesis \n\n Hip replacement was prescribed for a 45 year old female. She felt she was too young to have the invasive surgical care that was recommended because she was unable to walk without severe pain and limping, and required a cane. Surgery was also averted with use of subject composition therapeutics oral therapeutics. This therapeutics was administered orally 2 to 3 times daily. Her pain and range of motion normalized. This patient progressively responded to subject composition oral therapeutics, (topical therapy was not available at the time of initiation of subject composition oral therapeutics). Subject composition therapeutics was administered with some immediate response in the next 6 months. Over a period of 5 years normalization of the range of hip motion occurred and she is now able to walk 10,000 paces daily without pain, and without the need for any support.\n\n\nA female patient age 45 was diagnosed in with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis of the hip. Planning for hip replacement was cancelled in view of the dramatic improvement with normalization of the hip joint. Functionality of the hip joint was normalized, from a hip joint that showed no joint space and a complete arthritic fusion of the hip joint using a variant of this therapeutic subject composition.\n\n\nWithin a year, the patient went from being unable to walk the distance of a block without severe pain in the hip, to 5,000 paces per day. Within the next year she was able to walk 10,000 paces daily pain-free which she has maintained to date. Most recently, she was able to walk 12,000 comfortable, pain-free paces per day. Available to the patient through component supplied by Puritan Pride, Oakdale, New\n\n\nYork (See Table 5)\n\n\nCase 14. (c.) Bilateral osteo-arthritis\n\n\nIn both knees in a 60 year old male, presented with left knee more involved than the right, associated with pain and limitation of range of motion upon bending, ( of several decades duration). Trauma was a possible contributory factor in triggering the bilateral osteo-arthritis. Within two weeks of onset of treatment, the patient noticed a 50% improvement in pain and limitation of motion, and approximately a 50% reduction in associated symptoms and signs of swelling and fluid collection in the left knee. The treatment included Neocate (SHS International Liverpool UK) 1 teaspoon added to 3 ounces of spring water, shaken well to emulsify 1 to 3 times daily; phospholipid phosphatidyl choline, (Carlton Laboratories, Arlington Heights, IL) 1 capsule 3 times daily; Glucosamine sulfate, Chondroitin sulfate, MSM (the Vitamin Shoppe North Bergen, NJ or Now Foods, \n\n Bloomingdale, IL); VitaCarte (Phoenix Biologies, Vista California Vita Cart Chondroitin sulfate 750 mg per 4, type 2 collagen was 720 mg per capsule 3 to 4 times daily) 1.2 g of phosphatidyl choline complex (400 mg phosphatidyl, 56 mg choline 2 to 3 times daily); essential lipids Norwegian Salmon Oil 1 g capsule of Omega 3 EPA and DAJ (2 capsules, 2 to 3 times daily).\n\n\nBilateral osteo-arthritis of the knee joints. Male age 60, had a knee replacement and was awaiting scheduling for a second knee replacement. With the addition of Cartilade (Ontario, Canada, formerly BioTherapies, Inc., Fairfield NJ.) he progressively improved over several months, averting the need for prosthetic knee replacement.\n\n\nCase 14. (d.) Rotator cuff tear\n\n\n2 male patients, age 56, and age 80, had surgical care averted with the use of subject composition therapeutic lotion applied topically to the affected area. Diagnosis was confirmed clinically by examinations which also included an MRI examination in one patient.\n\n\nSymptoms of pain and weakness in abduction of the left arm and forearm (Movement by the patient, abduction, of upper extremity 90 degree angle away from the body). Diagnoses of both patients' were confirmed by orthopedic examination. The first patient's diagnosis was also confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance examination. Patients progressively improved over a period of three to four weeks. Symptomatic improvement was noted in regard to pain reduction, within five to ten minutes after local application in the medication included no analgesic.\n\n\nHowever, most significant relief was noted after about 1 week when Neocate (SHS International, Liverpool UK, now available through Nutricia Gaithersburg, MD) was added. Progressive improvement was noted and the orthopedic surgeon felt that surgery that was being considered was no longer required.\n\n\nDosages are:\n\n\n-about 1 to 2 tablespoons Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM Cream (Nature's Plus, Melville, NY) - about 1 to 2 tablespoons Vitamin A&D Zinc Oxide Cream (Schering-Plough\n\n\nHealthcare Products, Inc, Memphis, TN)\n\n\n- about 1 to 2 tablespoons Vitamin E Cream (Jason Natural Products, Culver City, CA) \n\n - about 1 to2 capsules Branched Chain Amino Acids — Valine, Leucine & Isoleucine (Life Extensions, Ft. Lauderdale, FL)\n\n\n- about VA to ½ teaspoon de-oiled Soy Lecithin Powder (Solec, St. Louis, MO) or 1,200 mg lecithin capsules containing 400 mg Phosphatidyl Choline (Carlson Laboratories, Arlington Heights, IL)\n\n\n- about 2 to 3 times daily applied Heating Pad after local application.\n\n\n*Later added the following, therapeutic response was not noted until this addition to the lotion which was made after about 1 week of use: -Neocate (SHS International Ltd., Liverpool, UK) 1 teaspoon in addition to one capsule of branched chain amino acids Life Extension and Ft. Lauderdale Florida, stirred well in the foregoing well mixed formulation\n\n\nAdditionally noteworthy therapeutic response resulted in the patient age 80 who also had a fungal infection in the right medial corner of his middle finger nail and nail bed (ungual tinea infection) which was persistent for several months. The foregoing transdermal topical lotion cream (fortunately but initially unintentionally applied as a therapeutic focus) included in application was applied to this area while applying it to the left arm torn rotator cuff area as described above. The nail returned to normal in a few weeks, with normal re-growth of the finger nail. Since unintentional and inadvertent initially, this might be looked upon as a valiant of the blind therapeutic application with clinical response of chronic fungal (tinea) otherwise unresponsive to prior treatment.\n\n\nThe healing anti-inflammatory activity of subject composition therapeutic topical lotion was dramatized with its successful local use in the above 2 male patients with rotator cuff tear. Surgical care was averted with the use of therapeutic subject composition of matter lotion applied topically to the point of maximum tenderness of the affected shoulder.\n\n\nDiagnosis was confirmed clinically by orthopedic examinations which also included an MRI examination.\n\n\nCase Group 15. Therapeutic use of therapeutic subject composition transdermal immunotherapeutic anti-inflammatory healing lotion in equine veterinary animal care for Tenosynovitis, tendonitis, traumatic arthritis, and therapeutic response\n\n\nIt was this therapeutic success in the torn rotator cuff in the humans that prompted similar successful local topical therapeutic subject composition of matter lotion application \n\n with complete recovery in Equine Veterinary care. (Most recently reported) when used in 27 total equine veterinarian cases of disabled horses due to tendonitis, tendosynovitis and traumatic arthritis.\n\n\nIt was this therapeutic success that prompted similar successful local, transdermal, topical lotion application, use in the 27 cases of equine veterinarian arthritis and tendosynovitis. The horses legs were shaved, covered with the lotion application, and saran wrapped so that the animal would not rub off the lotion. In one case, the skin had been completely avulsed, (traumatically torn away). This case was covered with the amnion as part of the equine embryonic cell mass, instead of saran wrap. This work with the equine veterinarian included therapeutic subject composition of matter lotion, local application with traumatic arthritis and tendosynovitis that further included reversal of the extensive areas of damaged skin (that had been traumatically avulsed). All cases were not responsive prior to current therapy. To quote the equine veterinarian, 100% efficacy was achieved with this therapeutic subject composition of matter whereas the most advanced equine veterinarian therapeutics was not effective.\n\n\nFormulation ratios and amounts to provide a final transdermal delivery system lotion product with dosage for humans is about !4 to ½ teaspoon, applied locally to the skin in the horses, the dosage is 4 to 8 times greater because of their increased six fold weight over humans and an increased surface area and tissue area for transdermal absorption, and penetrants to subjacent tissues, and disease reversal:\n\n\n-about 1 to 2 tablespoons Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM Cream (Nature's Plus, Melville, NY)\n\n\n- about 1 to 2 tablespoons Vitamin A&D Zinc Oxide Cream (Schering-Plough Healthcare Products, Inc, Memphis, TN) -about 1 to 2 tablespoons Vitamin E Cream (Jason Natural Products, Culver City, CA)\n\n\n-about 1 to 2 capsules Branched Chain Amino Acids — Valine, Leucine & Isoleucine (Life Extensions. Ft. Lauderdale, FL)\n\n\n-about ¼ to ½ teaspoon de-oiled Soy Lecithin Powder (Solec, St. Louis, MO) or 1,200 mg lecithin capsules containing 400 mg Phosphatidyl Choline (Carlson Laboratories, Arlington Heights, IL)\n\n\n-2 to 3 times daily applied Heating Pad after local application \n\n -Neocate (SHS International Ltd., Liverpool, UK) 1 teaspoon in addition to one capsule of branched chain amino acids Life Extension and Ft. Lauderdale Florida, stirred well in the foregoing well mixed formulation\n\n\n- about 1 to 2 tablespoons MSM Liposome Lotion (Now Foods Bloomingdale, IL) this has been added to further synergize the healing protein synthesis, anti-inflammatory therapeutics applied to torn rotator cuff as well as the musculoskeletal therapeutics applied to Equine veterinary medicine.\n\n\nThis also provides a methodology for drug discovery by co-using in the therapeutics of an existing veterinarian disease. At the same time, this represents a method of drug discovery in animal testing with use in an existing analog disease model. This was accomplished without experimentally producing a disease model in an animal, representing an ethical and humane advance in drug discovery as well as a significant economic advantage in greatly minimizing the costs that are escalating in drug development by accomplishing two beneficial therapeutic effects at the same time. Case 16 Cervical musculoskeletal strain\n\n\nThese veterinary case observations and lotion therapeutic advances were further used in medical care of female, age 76, awakened from sleep with acute cervical musculoskeletal strain and arthritis. She responded after topical application of subject composition therapeutics. After treatment she was symptom free of pain with full range of cervical motion normalization upon awakening the next morning. This transdeπnal immunotherapeutics, antiinflammatory, tissue healing, activation of the patient's own stem cell subject composition lotion, locally applied to the painful neck muscles 2 to 3 times daily, included:\n\n\n-about 1 to 2 tablespoons Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM Cream (Nature's Plus, Melville. NY) - about 1 to 2 tablespoons Vitamin A&D Zinc Oxide Cream (Schering-Plough\n\n\nHealthcare Products, Inc, Memphis, TN)\n\n\n-about 1 to 2 tablespoons Vitamin E Cream (Jason Natural Products, Culver City, CA) -about 1 to 2 capsules Branched Chain Amino Acids — Valine, Leucine & Isoleucine (Life Extensions, Ft. Lauderdale, FL) -about ¼ to ½ teaspoon de-oiled Soy Lecithin Powder (Solec, St. Louis, MO) or 1 ,200 mg lecithin capsules containing 400 mg Phosphatidyl Choline (Carlson Laboratories, Arlington Heights, IL)\n\n\n-2 to 3 times daily applied Heating Pad after local application \n\n -Neocate (SHS International Ltd., Livepool, UK) 1 teaspoon in addition to one capsule of branched chain amino acids Life Extension and Ft. Lauderdale Florida, stirred well in the foregoing well mixed formulation\n\n\n- about 1 to 2 tablespoons MSM Liposome Lotion (Now Foods Bloomingdale, IL) this has been added to further syncrgize the healing protein synthesis, anti-inflammatory therapeutics applied to torn rotator cuff as well as the musculoskeletal therapeutics applied to Equine veterinary medicine.\n\n\nCase 17 Plantar fascial inflammation in a female adult patient This acute musculoskeletal strain and severe foot pain occurred when getting out of bed, and standing with bare feet. The strain was associated with extensive standing and walking without her customary shoe arch support. With the use of the foregoing lotion application and soak supplied for the acute gout arthritis was followed by progressive improvement over a 1 week period. The use of Advil liquid filled capsules solubilized ibuprofen locally added to the transdermal cream expedited the reversal of acute gout after one - two applications. This was administered by emptying the Advil liquid filled capsules onto the acute gout arthritis resulted in the reversal of the gout inflammation after a few applications. The orally administered treatment further included therapeutic subject composition extra-cellular matrix components chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine sulfate, MSM 2 to 3 capsules, 3 times daily; Vita Carte Bovine Cartilage, (Phoenix Biologies Vista, CA) 4 capsules, 3 times daily ; Cartilade shark cartilage, (Ontario, Canada, formerly BioTherapies, Inc., Fairfield NJ.) 4 capsules 3 times daily, was also added to allay the severe discomfort (Now Foods Bloomingdale, IL); Neocate (Neocate infant foπnula SHS Liverpool, UK and Nutritia Gaithersburg, MD) 1 to 2 teaspoons emulsified in 3 ounces of spring water daily ; and phospholipid phosphatidyl choline 1.2 grams, 3 times daily (Carlson Laboratories, Arlington Heights, IL)The pain was so severe that she felt that a narcotic (such as codeine) would be necessary, however, using 2 Bufferin (GlaxoSmithKline Research Triangle Park, NC) functioned synergistically with complete relief of pain, obviating the need for any major pain medication. The patient was also treated with this transdermal immunotherapeutics, antiinflammatory, tissue healing, activation of the patient's own stem cell subject composition lotion, locally applied to the sole of the foot 2 to 3 times daily, included: \n\n -about 1 to 2 tablespoons Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM Cream (Nature's Plus, Melville, NY)\n\n\n- about 1 to 2 tablespoons Vitamin A&D Zinc Oxide Cream (Schering-Plough Healthcare Products, Inc, Memphis. TN) -about 1 to 2 tablespoons Vitamin E Cream (Jason Natural Products, Culver City, CA)\n\n\n-about 1 to 2 capsules Branched Chain Amino Acids — Valine, Leucine & Isoleucine (Life Extensions. Ft. Lauderdale, FL)\n\n\n-about VA, to ½ teaspoon de-oiled Soy Lecithin Powder (Solec, St. Louis, MO) or 1,200 mg lecithin capsules containing 400 mg Phosphatidyl Choline (Carlson Laboratories, Arlington Heights, IL)\n\n\n-2 to 3 times daily applied Heating Pad after local application\n\n\n-Neocate (SHS International Ltd., Liverpool, UK) 1 teaspoon in addition to one capsule of branched chain amino acids Life Extension and Ft. Lauderdale Florida, stirred well in the foregoing well mixed formulation - about 1 to 2 tablespoons MSM Liposome Lotion (Now Foods Bloomingdale, IL) this has been added to further synergize the healing protein synthesis, anti-inflammatory therapeutics applied to torn rotator cuff as well as the musculoskeletal therapeutics applied to Equine veterinary medicine.\n\n\nCase 18 Neurologic disease: Hearing Loss in aging\n\n\nA 76 year old female patient with neuro-sensory hearing loss, documented by audiologic studies. She responded in 24 hours to improvement in hearing loss. She was given 1 capsule containing Choline 250 mg; and Inositol, 250 mg (Now Foods, Bloomingdale, IL) 3 times daily. Her hearing improved in that she was now able to hear when someone spoke behind her and additionally she was able to hear the whispered voice. These findings were observed without the use of her hearing aid. Her hearing was augmented to some degree by her hearing aid. Her prior management with hearing aid was not reliably effective. This was also felt to be able to augment the effects of phosphatidyl serine; 100 mg, 3 times daily, which was of value in helping her occasional memory loss functionality. This treatment was added to the subject composition therapeutics of her Crohn's disease, as a continuation of therapy illustrated in Case 24 and is included in its entirety by reference (p. 83 through p. 90). \n\n Hearing loss, associated with the neυro catabolic factors of aging, and use of Choline and Inositol have been added to therapeutic subject composition to help advance the care of neurologic disease, as in neuro-sensory hearing loss.\n\n\nThis memory loss recurred and significantly improved: by the further addition of acetyl L-carnitine (the acetyl form has been noted to be nervous system active in contrast to the non-acetyl form which is helpful in cardiovascular disease) ( Life Extension, Fort Lauderdale, FL or Doctor's Preferred LLC, Potomac MD) 500mg 3-4 times daily. It is felt that this is a most helpful addition. However, another product was also added, PS complex (phosphatidyl serine). It probably is not having a significant effect. In addition, the hydrophilic surfactant affect phosphatidyl choline (Carlson Laboratories, Arlington Heights, IL) 1.2 grams per capsule three times per day. Alpha-GPC (Doctor's Preferred LLC, Potomac MD) a derivative of the phosphatidyl choline 125mg two capsules times per day was also added: Vitamin B 6 38mg Folic Acid 50 meg\n\n\nVitamin B 12 25 meg Pantothenic Acid 50mg Alpha-Glycerylphosphorycholine 125mg Green Tea Extract 50mg Blueberry Powder 25mg DMAE 20mg and Vinpocetine 5mg was added to subject composition.\n\n\n5- methyltetrahydrofolate 1.2 mg daily, is added to subject composition as effective dosage range 0.2 to 1.2 mg daily (5-MTHF, Life Extension, Ft. Lauderdale, FL) a normal bioactive format of folic acid component of mammalian tissue such as human tissue not requiring metabolic conversion nor masking nor obscuring vitamin B 12 detection and being added to enhance memory and mental function and the normalization of the abnormal level of homocysteine (defiant in folic acid or B 12). Also synergistically helpful components of subject composition riboflavin 100 mg daily to twice daily, vitamin B6 50 to lOOmg daily . Catalyzing conversion of homocysteine to normal amino acid L cysteine and then to glutathione, B12 helping to catalyze methylation conversion to essential L methionine. Trimethylglycine (betaine) up to 6 grams daily may be added if necessary to reduce homocysteine. Also applicable in the following cardiac patient. \n\n Also is added to subject composition in a male patient early 80's who had border-line abnormal homocysteine of 13 mg% (abnormal level of above 14%) with associated increase in sed-rate to 35 mm/hr and C reactive protein while under cardiac care to prevent future myocardial infarction.\n\n\nCase 19 Epilepsy\n\n\nAdolescent, age 16 was treated with phosphatidyl choline, (Carlson Laboratories, Arlington Heights, IL) 1 gram, 2 to 3 times daily, with relief of epileptic seizures. This case provides similar anti-seizure effect that resulted from the use of phospholipid phosphatidyl choline for small animals (dogs and cats). This 16 year old boy was able to find work and not be handicapped by the concerns of epileptic seizures and has remained symptom free of seizures for several years.\n\n\nCase 20. Neurologic Diseases including Alzheimer's Disease\n\n\n(1.) A 70 year old patient is treated for progressive memory loss suspected of being Alzheimer's originated with folic acid, 3 capsules, 3 times daily, of 400 mg capsule, (TwinLab Corporation, Hauppauge, NY) Vitamin B- 12, 1 mg (Methyl cobalomine, Jarrow Laboratories Los Angeles, CA) Phosphatidyl serine 100 mg, 3 times daily, 1 capsule containing Choline 250 mg; and Inositol, 250 mg (Now Foods, Bloomingdale, IL) 3 times daily, 1.2 g Phosphatidyl Choline 3 times daily (Carlson Laboratories, Arlington Heights, IL) 1 g Norwegian Salmon Oil, 2 capsules, 3 times daily (Carlson Laboratories Arlington Heights IL), Ascorbic Acid 1 g, 3 times daily (Mead Johnson, Evansville IL); Bovine Cartilage 4 capsules, 3 times daily (Phoenix Biologies, Vista, California) Glucosamine and Chondroitin sulfate, 2 to 3 capsules, 3 times daily (Now Foods, Bloomingdale, IL) Neocate (SHS International Ltd., Liverpool, UK, also Nutricia, Gaithersburg, MD) 1 to 3 teaspoon, 3 times daily; Vitamin B-50 complex, 1 tablet, 2 times daily (Sundown Incorporated, Boca Raton, FL).\n\n\nThis patient's therapeutics, and clinical course, will also be tracked, preferably before treatment and clinical course follow up with the following cognitive laboratory tests: with homocysteine levels, as well as a test for abnormally high methylmalonic acid blood levels, an indication of deficiency in B-12. If abnormal, vitamin B-6, and folic acid will also be tested. This is with particular reference to psycho geriatric cases in that B-12 and folic acid \n\n deficiencies have been commonly found, however dementia has not been noted without a reduced level of folic acid. These reduced levels have also been the case with Parkinson's disease patients, with even higher homocysteine levels (an index of the dysmetabolic 3-D stereo mismatch and misfit of homocysteine in contrast to its normal isomer form of methionine and or cysteine). These amino acids are essential to satisfy the amino aid molar ratios, specified by the genetic code of targeted neuro proteins. Therefore, this treatment would be applicable to (2.) patient with Parkinsonism is treated as well with the foregoing therapeutics.\n\n\n(3.) Treatment of Schizophrenia. The foregoing treatment and clinical course tracking system, is also applicable and is used in a patient diagnosed as schizophrenic with characteristic delusional hallucinations and age of onset, late teens and 20s, since homocysteine levels have been found to be abnormally high in schizophrenia. Also, since the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has been dominant, the tryptophan is to be added, 500 mg at bed time. This may be repeated 1 to 2 times daily if it is not found to be soporific. Additionally, intestinal permeability studies should be done to rule out a predisposing factor of poor intestinal absorption celiac disease. The foregoing amino acids as in therapeutic subject composition, should be helpful in reversing abnormal permeability, a contributory factor to some cases of schizophrenia. Celiac disease, treatment also includes avoidance of gliadin, present in wheat and other grains except for rice and corn. Rice and corn do not activate Celiac Disease. These patients have high serum antibodies to gliadin and other food proteins, probably secondary to increased permeability which is a result of enteropathy produced by T cell defects. The B cell immune complexes of antibody plus gliadin also contribute to the enteropathy. Through B cell antibody dependency and some mediated cytotoxicity, and activation of complement. Psychiatric disturbances, such as schizophrenia are associated with this intestinal immunologic defect which, if found must also be treated (Amenable to amino acid therapy as part of subject therapeutic composition).\n\n\nIt is important to note here that neurologic diseases such as schizophrenia can be triggered by dental anesthesia nitrous oxide. (Cautious use in genetic treatment if there is a pattern of schizophrenia). This concern is more specifically applicable in, multiple sclerosis cases, but further more specifically applicable to Vitamin B-12 deficiency. As we have noted before, it is a common co factor with folic acid in patients with Dementia.\n\n\nCase 21. Treatment of Burns \n\n A female patient age 49 accidentally scalded her hand with very hot coffee resulting in a third degree burn about linch in diameter. This progressively healed over a period of 2 to 3 weeks without any scarring with the use of the following transdermal anti-inflammatory activation of healing immunotherapeutics lotion. Formulation ratios and amounts to provide a final transdermal delivery system lotion product with dosage for humans is about ¼ to ½ teaspoon, applied locally to the skin, for transdermal absorption, and penetration to subjacent tissues, and damaged tissue reversal was prepared as follows:\n\n\n-about 1 to 2 tablespoons Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM Cream (Nature's Plus, Melville, NY)\n\n\n-about 1 to 2 tablespoons Vitamin A&D Zinc Oxide Cream (Schering-Plough Healthcare Products, Inc, Memphis, TN)\n\n\n-about 1 to 2 tablespoons Vitamin E Cream (Jason Natural Products, Culver City, CA) -about 1 to 2 capsules Branched Chain Amino Acids — Valine, Leucine & lsoleucine (Life Extensions, Ft. Lauderdale, FL)\n\n\n-about % to Vz teaspoon de-oiled Soy Lecithin Powder (Solec, St. Louis, MO) or 1,200 mg lecithin capsules containing 400 mg Phosphatidyl Choline (Carlson Laboratories, Arlington Heights, IL)\n\n\n-2 to 3 times daily applied Heating Pad after local application -Neocate (SHS International Ltd., Liverpool, UK) 1 teaspoon in addition to one capsule of branched chain amino acids Life Extension and Ft. Lauderdale Florida, stirred well in the foregoing well mixed formulation\n\n\n- about 1 to 2 tablespoons MSM Liposome Lotion (Now Foods Bloomingdale, IL) this has been added to further synergize the healing protein synthesis, anti -inflammatory therapeutics applied to torn rotator cuff as well as the musculoskeletal therapeutics applied to Equine veterinary medicine.\n\n\nCase Group 22. New Drug Discovery\n\n\n(1.) This also provides formulation examples as well as a methodology for drug discovery by co-using in the therapeutics of an existing veterinary disease. At the same time, this represents a method of drug discovery in animal testing with use in an existing analog disease model. This was accomplished without experimentally producing a disease model in an animal. This represents an ethical and humane advance in drug discovery, as well as a \n\n significant economic advantage in greatly minimizing the costs that are escalating in drug development by accomplishing two beneficial therapeutic effects at the same time.* The advantage is healing an animal requiring, and unresponsive to existing veterinary therapeutics, in contrast to reproducing the disease in the experimental animal, with the advantages cited above.* This is further exemplified by use of transdermal immunotherapeutic anti-inflammatory healing lotion based on therapeutic success and averting the need for surgery in human use, two patients with torn rotator cuffs. Another principle to follow is this 3-D stereo chemical fit, to prevent misfit can be further conceptualized in terms of the resulting from this misfit in the form of metabolic intolerance that we have progressively discovered in regard to trans-fatty acid fats a product of hydrogenation design based on 2-D chemistry. As a result this clinical medicine 3-D stereo chemical misfit acting as a biochemical molecular foreign body was originally mandated to be removed from the marketplace by the country of Denmark make great strides in food chemistry and hand through their leadership has been taken off the market throughout the world.\n\n\nThis 3-D fit represents a biologic model that was utilized in another biologic model of mimicking human tissue, and mammalian, such as human tissue's healing capacity. Therefore, to accomplish these 3-D integrative biologic fits, this may best be sourced by FDA pre-approved-as-sqfe components. These 3-D integrative biologic fits arc derived from such as, but not limited to, plant, animal, and synthetic sources as long as a 3-D integrative biologic fit is maintained, such as the L amino acid and glycine used in subject composition therapeutics. Additionally, microorganism sources are used, all with the precaution of avoidance of catabolic bio-chcmicals such as, but not limited to, lactic acid bacteria pro- biotics. Formulation ratios and amounts to provide a final transdermal delivery system lotion product with dosage for humans is about ¼ to Vz teaspoon, applied locally to the skin in the horses, the dosage is 4 to 8 times greater because of their increased six fold weight over humans and an increased surface area and tissue area for transdermal absorption, and penetrants to subjacent tissues, and disease reversal: -about 1 to 2 tablespoons Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM Cream (Nature's Plus,\n\n\nMelville, NY)\n\n\n- about 1 to 2 tablespoons Vitamin A&D Zinc Oxide Cream (Schering-Plough Healthcare Products, Inc, Memphis, TN) \n\n -about 1 to 2 tablespoons Vitamin E Cream (Jason Natural Products, Culver City, CA) -about 1 to 2 capsules Branched Chain Amino Acids — Valine, Leucine & Isoleucine (Life Extensions, Ft. Lauderdale, FL)\n\n\n-about ¼ to ½ teaspoon de-oiled Soy Lecithin Powder (Solec, St. Louis, MO) or 1,200 mg lecithin capsules containing 400 mg Phosphatidyl Choline (Carlson Laboratories, Arlington Heights, IL)\n\n\n-2 to 3 times daily applied Heating Pad after local application\n\n\n-Neocate (SHS International Ltd., Liverpool, UK) 1 teaspoon in addition to one capsule of branched chain amino acids Life Extension and Ft. Lauderdale Florida, stirred well in the foregoing well mixed formulation\n\n\n- about 1 to 2 tablespoons MSM Liposome Lotion (Now Foods Bloomingdale, IL) this has been added to further synergize the healing protein synthesis, anti-inflammatory therapeutics applied to torn rotator cuff as well as the musculoskeletal therapeutics applied to Equine veterinary medicine. (2.) Most importantly, our providing cell biology and analog models to enables this therapeutic subject composition of matter to reverse the significant therapeutic challenge of diseases of poor prognosis. This example of cell model and analog models can best be illustrated by: therapeutics composition of matter in reversing cancer in- vitro and in- vivo.\n\n\n(3.) Example of an anticancer therapeutics cell biology model and basis for therapeutic advance in treatment: The initial study of comparative microscopy of the remarkably similar configuration of the characteristic cell of cancer with the lipophilic micelle liquid crystal configuration when adjacently placed for comparative study. It is believed this colloidal emulsion technology domain, structural geometric, microscopic, configuration that the foregoing lipophilic micelle and characteristic cell of cancer shares functional biophysical colloidal emulsion technology parameters. These commonalities appear to offer a cell and micelle biology therapeutic opportunities in reversing and normalizing the enigma of cancer tissue and its clinical consequences.\n\n\nThe analog cell biology model for the pharmacodynamics and pharmacologic basis for this unique application is exemplified as shown on Diagram I\n5\n Figure I\n5\n on page 37. Example of an anticancer therapeutics cell biology model and basis for therapeutic advance in treatment: The initial study of comparative microscopy of (1.) remarkably similar configuration of the characteristic cell of cancer with the lipophilic micelle liquid crystal configuration when adjacently placed for comparative study. It is believed this colloidal \n\n emulsion technology domain structural, geometric, microscopic, configuration that the foregoing lipophilic micelle and characteristic cell of cancer phase; they also share (2.) functional biophysical colloidal emulsion technology parameters. These commonalities appear to offer a cell and micelle biology therapeutic opportunity in reversing and normalizing the enigma of cancer tissue and its clinical consequences.\n\n\nThe therapeutic concept of reversing the highly lipophilic functionality to a progressively more obverse hydrophilic colloidal emulsion technology state provided a therapeutic working model to study this significant therapeutic potential opportunity in-vitro and in-vivo. Additionally, the colloidal emulsion technology biophysical parameters illustrated in diagram 1 , figure 1, were found useful to direct successful therapy in a disease with formerly very pessimistic poor prognosis therapeutic opportunities. This has been further established providing the selectivity potential for a non invasive therapeutics to enhance the therapeutic response and prognosis in diseases that now include cancer.\n\n\n(4.) In addition, the essential analog cell biology model required for drug discovery, is shown here Of 70 studies of the foregoing 247 clinical and preclinical studies, representing 44 bio-chemicals, 27 and (12 of 44) dramatized a 3-D bio-chemical trend. This trend is also computerizable and provides positive therapeutic results, killing in excess of 88% of cancer tissue within 24 to 48 hours. Five (5) of these studies demonstrated a cancer cell kill rate of 99% to 100% in the same time frame. This is particularly noteworthy since these results were achieved using FDA pre-approved-as-safe components comprising I subject composition therapeutics synthetic cell-like micro-environment therapeutics.\n\n\nThe foregoing is statistically significant, since the current technology of early stage drug discovery utilizes comparative biochemical structures and through computer search commonly requiring 3 million studies so that 1 chemical might be found. If we add the criteria of drug discovery used in the development of this composition of matter into the computer search, the yield would be even significantly less. For example, to achieve this degree of safety, another computer search would have to be superimposed. This would further include a track record of safety over several decades as in this subject composition of matter. Therefore the yield of available compounds would be significantly lessened even more so. If the criteria of the computer search further included simultaneously mimicking human tissue and immunologic 'self as biochemical equivalents of human tissue and its micronutrient and microenvironment of immunologic self, this would even further lessen the yield of potential new compounds. \n\n (5.) This progression of filed and issued patents provide a cell biology matrix with self validating mechanisms of the healing process of the synthetic cell-like microenvironment that industry can build upon through further practicing and advancing this patent. The pharmaceutical industry may benefit from this advantageous position by developing and utilizing therapeutic products thereof. At the same time, the pharmaceutical industry will still find themselves within the fundamental scope and chemical infrastructure of the matrix of cell biology mediating healing and disease reversal.\n\n\nCase 23. Therapeutic Subject Composition Care of Dermatologic Fungal Infection Concurrent with treatment of torn rotator cuff, the following therapeutic dermatologic response was noted in reversing to normal a chronic fungal infection of the finger nail.\n\n\nNoteworthy, is the therapeutic response in the patient age 80, who also had a persistent fungal infection of several months duration, in the right medial corner of his middle finger nail and nail bed (ungual tinea infection). The treated area (fortunately but initially unintentionally included in application to this area while applying the foregoing to the right arm torn rotator cuff area of damaged tissue) returned to normal in a few weeks, with normal re-growth of nail. Since unintentional and inadvertent initially, this might be looked upon as a variant of a blind therapeutic application with clinical response to chronic fungal (tinea), otherwise unresponsive to treatment. The healing anti-inflammatory activity of subject composition therapeutic topical lotion was dramatized with its successful local use in the above 2 male patients with rotator cuff tear. Surgical care was averted with the use of therapeutic subject composition of matter lotion applied topically to the point of maximum tenderness of the affected shoulder. Diagnosis was confirmed clinically by orthopedic examinations which also included an MRl examination.\n\n\nSubject Therapeutic Composition was as follows: applied topically to the area of maximal tenderness of the rotator cuff.\n\n\n- about 1 to 2 tablespoons Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM Cream (Nature's Plus, Melville, NY) - about 1 to 2 tablespoons Vitamin A&D Zinc Oxide Cream (Schering-Plough\n\n\nHealthcare Products, Inc, Memphis, TN)\n\n\n- about 1 to 2 tablespoons Vitamin E Cream (Jason Natural Products, Culver City, CA) \n\n - about 1 to2 capsules Branched Chain Amino Acids — Valine, Leucine & Isoleucine (Life Extensions, Ft. Lauderdale, FL)\n\n\n- about ¼ to ½ teaspoon de-oiled Soy Lecithin Powder (Solec, St. Louis, MO) or 1,200 mg lecithin capsules containing 400 mg Phosphatidyl Choline (Carlson Laboratories, Arlington Heights. IL)\n\n\n- about 2 to 3 times daily applied Heating Pad after local application\n\n\n-Neocate (SHS International Ltd., Liverpool, UK) 1 teaspoon in addition to one capsule of branched chain amino acids Life Extension and Ft. Lauderdale Florida, stirred well in the foregoing well mixed formulation - about 1 to 2 table spoons MSM Liposome Lotion (Now Foods Bloomingdale, IL) this has been added to further synergize the healing protein synthesis, anti-inflammatory therapeutics applied to torn rotator cuff as well as the musculoskeletal therapeutics applied to Equine veterinary medicine.\n\n\nIt was these 2 therapeutic successful responses of the torn rotator cuff, and dermatologic reversal of chronic fungal infection of the finger nail ,that prompted similar successful local, topical, use in the 27 cases of equine veterinarian arthritis and tenosynovitis. The horses legs were shaved, covered the lotion application and saran wrapped so that the animal would not rub off the lotion application. In one case, the skin was completely avulsed, (traumatically torn away) and in this case was covered with the amnion as part of the equine embryonic cell mass, instead of saran wrap.\n\n\nCase Group 24. Atherosclerosis and Coronary Artery Disease\n\n\nFour patients treated using subject composition oral therapeutics as a statin substitute, with 25 to 30% decrease in cholesterol resulting.

It is believed this affect could be used for possibly saving a patient one dialysis treatment a week with chronic kidney disease and renal failure, and its serious complication of uremia, the buildup of the urea waste product of protein metabolism. This dramatic success using such safe innocuous products for complications of catabolic products of protein metabolism, uric acid in the case of gout, and urea in the case of kidney failure provides a simplistic therapy for two conditions that have serious disease consequences.\n\n\nCase Group 26. Anti-Cancer Therapeutics 70 In- Vitro studies and end stage cancer patients In -Vivo studies\n\n\nOf 70 studies of the foregoing 247 clinical and preclinical studies, representing 44 bio-chemicals, 27& (12 of 44) dramatized a 3-D bio-chemical trend. This trend is also computerizable and provides positive therapeutic results, killing in excess of 88% of cancer tissue within 24 to 48 hours. Five (5) of these studies demonstrated a cancer cell kill rate of 99% to 100% in the same time frame. This is particularly noteworthy since these results were achieved using FDA pre-approved-as-safe components comprising subject composition therapeutics synthetic cell-like micro-environment therapeutics.\n\n\nEach step represents a cell biology model of the normal process that has the capacity to reverse the diseased cell biology model: Pre-clinical Anti-cancer Hydrophilic Surfactant Therapeutic Examples:\n\n\nThe degree of anticancer hydrophilic surfactant therapeutic effect is proportionate to the hydrophilicity whether hydrophilic phospholipids, hydrophilic surfactant activity of free amino acids, or whether this effect is seen through the extracellular matrix glycoprotein protein that has more hydrophilicity (post-translational) and directional effects of the carbohydrate moiety (like the analog directional model of glycosylated extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, functioning directionally as a 'railway tag').\n\n\nCancer Cell In- Vitro Therapeutic Trial of Efficacy Study and Results \n\n Cell line and cell culture conditions and preparation of the Helen Lane derived cancer cells (American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, Maryland), HeLa Cells cancer cell line.\n\n\nOriginally donated by Helen Lane and her family to advance the study of cancer and known as the HeLa Cells.\n\n\nCell line and Culture Conditions:\n\n\nThe cell line MCF-7 was maintained in RMPI-1640, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), Penicillin/Strep (1.1%), and Sodium bicarbonate (7.5%). This was incubated at 37°C with 5% C atmosphere. The adherent cells were harvested upon 90-95% confluence or monolayer coverage.\n\n\nPreparation of Cells:\n\n\nThe initial cell counts were conducted by detaching the MCF-7 cells with trypsine EDTA. This cell solution was incubated for five minutes and spun in the centrifuge at 1200 rpm. The pellet was re-suspended with RMPI-1640. A 1 :10 dilution of cells to trypan blue was used for determining cell counts using a Petroff Hauser Hemocytometer chamber.\n\n\nAt the end of the 24 to 48 hour observation of in-vitro, therapeutic efficacy in cancer cell kill (apoptosis), the resultant spectrophotometrically studies were further examined microscopically for the presence or absence of cancer cells in verifying the cancer cell kill (apoptosis). Tables 3 A, 3B, 3C, and 3D show the results of those treatments.\n\n\nClinical Anti-cancer Case Reports (clinical examples):\n\n\nTreatment of Tonsillar Cancer, Anal Cancer, and Small Cell Lung Cancer At the time of treatment, Patient 1 was a 35 year old male diagnosed with tonsillar cancer. His prognosis was determined to be poor. At the time of treatment, Patient 2 was an 81 year old male diagnosed with anal cancer having local dissemination. At the time of treatment, Patient 3 was 70 a year old female diagnosed with intractable small cell lung cancer, with metastasis and cachexia. Patient 3 weighed approximately 90 lbs and compl ained of fatigue.\n\n\nExample 1 : \n\n Patient 2 received a sterile non-pyrogenic composition of about 20% essential fatty acids (a mixture of linoleic and linolenic acid), 1.2% egg yolk phospholipid, and about 2% glycerin in water for injection. This composition is sold commercially as \"Intralipid,\" and was obtained from Baxter Healthcare Corp. (Deerfield, 111.); see attached photocopy of Intralipid IV package. Intralipid is manufactured for Baxter Healthcare by Fresenius Kabi AB (Uppsala, Sweden). 500 milliliters of Intralipid was given intravenously three times a week for one week. Patients 1 and 3 received a similar composition called Liposyn (Abbot Laboratories) intravenously three times a week for one week. Patient 2 received 500 ml per dose and Patient 3 was administered only 250 ml per dose. Liposyn is a sterile, nonpyrogenic fat emulsion for intravenous administration, which contains about 10% safflower oil, 1.2% egg phosphatides and about 2.5% glycerin in water for injection.\n\n\nPatients 1 , 2, and 3 showed an improvement in overall heath, including an increase in energy and relief of the fatigue and listlessness characteristic of cancer and disseminated cancer. Clinical signs of disease were visibly lessened. Regarding Patient 1, the prognosis was so grave that any signs of recovery were unexpected. However, after one week of treatment, it was reported that the improvement in Patient 1 was so dramatic that heath-care personnel had to verify the patient's name to be sure he was the same patient that had been admitted. Patient's 1 improvement continued throughout the entire course of treatment. Patient 2 was observed walking down the hall one month after treatment, and his gait was remarkably brisk in view of his age, and the extent and location of his anal cancer. Patient 3 suffered from the fatigue characteristic of cancer, particularly when complicated by metastasis and cachexia. However, 24 hours after administering the composition to Patient 3, her fatigue completely resolved, an unexpected result in a patient with such poor prognosis. This complete clearance of fatigue was noted again, lasting for 24 hours, after administration of the next two doses.\n\n\nExample 2: Treatment of Squamous Cell Cancer, Lung Adenocarcinoma, Metastatic Lung Cancer and Anal Cancer\n\n\nPatient 4 is a 57-year old male with squamous cell cancer of the hypopharynx. Within one week, this patient was given a single dose of 500 ml Intralipid (20%) and a single dose of 500 ml Intralipid (10%). After this treatment, the patient showed some clinical improvement in energy levels and a decrease in lassitude. \n\n Patient 5 is a 74-year old female with adenocarcinoma of the lung. This patient received three 500 ml doses of Intralipid (20%) in one week, and showed moderately increased energy levels and a reduction in lassitude.\n\n\nPatient 6 is an 81 -year old male suffering from right upper lobe lung cancer with metastatic spread in cervical lymph nodes right to left. This patient received one-daily doses of 250 ml Intralipid (10%) for 3 consecutive days. Patient 6 showed marked improvement in energy levels and a more than 60% lessening of radiation treatment side effects.\n\n\nPatient 7 is an adult male, 82-years old, suffering from anal cancer complicated by severe cachexia. At the time of treatment, this patient weighed approximately 144 lbs. Upon 3 times weekly dosing with 500 ml Intralipid (20%), the size of a superficial tumor in the anal and perianal area (initially 5 cm) was reduced 40% in size after three days of treatment. After five treatments, the enlarged inguinal lymph nodes returned normal. One indication was that local dissemination of the cancer had improved.\n\n\nFrom clinical observations of these patients before, during and after treatment with the Intralipid and Liposyn compositions, it is believed that the improvement in their clinical condition was the direct result of administering the composition.\n\n\nSubject Composition Anti-Cancer Therapeutics In- Vivo Pilot Study:\n\n\nBy providing more hydrophilic surfactants with biochemical and biophysical parameters obverse to cancer offers an effective, safe, opportunity for in-vitro, and in-vivo therapeutics with comparative anticancer mathematical ratios and formulations for further providing maximum anticancer efficacy selectivity.\n\n\nNot only is this applicable for subject composition anticancer therapeutics in adults, but also for children with cancer, where self image and innate immunity are so important. For all ages, subject composition therapeutics provides an unparalleled safety that does not interfere with growth and development.\n\n\nThe biochemical basis for subject composition therapeutics synthetic stem cell biochemical microenvironment therapeutic composition of matter anabolically reverses damaged and diseased tissue. Pilot study: 8 end-stage cancer patients, seven of which were acute, received 7 to 10 day intravenous egg yolk phospholipid therapeutics. Similar synergy and enhancement of therapeutic response and improvement of quality of life in end-stage cancer has been noted.\n\n\nOne patient with colon cancer that metastasized to the lung, despite complete removal of the \n\n colon, showed therapeutic response over a one year observation. His bowel cancer that metastasized to the lung was documented as normalized by a PET scan. Therapy has continued.\n\n\nCase 27. Metastatic Cancer\n\n\nA 50 year old male: Metastatic bowel cancer that metastasized to the lung was normalized, using the foregoing stem cell microenvironment anti-cancer subject composition therapeutics outlined herein. Extensive follow-up and treatment has continued because of the guarded prognosis of this disease. This treatment has consisted of a hydrophilic amino acid L lysine, hydrophilic phosphatidyl choline, 500 mg two times daily Carlson laboratories, Arlington Heights Illinois, extracellular matrix shark cartilage 2 capsules three times a day. Cartilade, (Ontario, Canada, formerly Biotherapies, Inc., Fairfϊeld NJ.) ; vitamin C (ascorbic acid) (Carlson laboratories) 500 mg 2 capsules 3times daily. His pre-treatment therapeutic composition anticancer prognosis was poor and the patient was given only \"one month to live\" and advised to get his affairs in order. The first sign of improvement was a return of his energy where he was able to keep up, for the first time, with his friend's pace walking in the mall. This was followed by being x-rayed again ordered by his oncologist. The x-ray showed a normalcy of his previously highly abnormal metastatic cancer found in the lung. The present invention thereby achieved a non-invasive, risk free medical lumpectomy for metastatic bowel cancer which spread to the lung. (Not known to the prior art). In the past few months the oncologists also provided 5 FU 1.5 mg intravenously every few weeks.\n\n\nTreatment that was initiated about 1 year ago also comprised of Tagamet (Cimetadine OTC (over the counter) Glaxosmithkline Research triangle Park, NC) 800 mg. daily of about 4 month duration because of the increased bowel cancer longevity to 85% survival in 5 years versus 45% with 5 FU alone as reported with Tagamet an H2 (histamine 2 blocker). This observation was further confirmed by finding an increase in histidine decarboxylase enzyme accounting for the increase in histamine derived from decarboxylated histidine.\n\n\nThe advantageous use of the PET scan as a metabolic anabolic test of subject composition therapeutic efficacy, can be best illustrated by the before mentioned diagnosis male patient with stage IV metastatic bowel cancer to pulmonary tissue with PET scan resolution with subject composition therapeutics. A consultant oncologist stated he has never seen a resolution in stage IV metastatic cancer (the response associated with the subject \n\n composition therapeutic anticancer use of synthetic stem cell-like microenvironment therapeutics). This can be illustrated by the enclosed PET scan which metabolically tracks reported subject composition anticancer therapeutic response.\n\n\nThree other end stage cancer patients were treated with phospholipid derived from egg yolk provided by Baxter and Abbott Laboratories (directed to cachexia) and used in radiation oncology the prevention of radiation burns in a (case 1) male patient age 72 with maxillary sinus cancer, (case 2) in esophageal cancer in a patient age 60, and (case 3) recurrent bladder cancer in a patient in her late 60s. This is similar to the therapeutics cited here that normalize the energy production in treating end stage cancer patients. A whole-body PET scan provided the following information:\n\n\nHistory: Colon Cancer\n\n\nAttenuation corrected imaging of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed on a dedicated PET scanner following intravenous injection of 11.23 mCl of FDG. Blood glucose was 168 at the time of injection. Comparison is made to previous study of September 12. 2007.\n\n\nNeck: Negative\n\n\nChest: There has been complete interval resolution of abnormal FDG activity associated with multiple pulmonary nodules as demonstrated on previous study. Although CT scan confirms the presence of small residual nodular densities, these have decreased significantly in size. For example, the dominant left infrahiler nodule on the current study now measures 17mm, as compared with 29 mm on the previous examination. Several additional bilateral nodules have also decreased in size. There are several peripheral benign appearing 3 to 4 mm nodules which are stable in size, but not associated with abnormal FDG activity. There is no evidence for residual abnormal activity within the lungs or mediastinum. Abdomen: normal\n\n\nPelvis: Again noted is mildly increased FDG activity at the level of rectal resection, with a maximum SUV of 8.1. This compares with an SUV of 5.3 on the previous examination. There is no associated mass or pelvic adenopathy. Bone marrow: There is a mild degree of diffuse marrow activity, midly increased from prior study, with SUV's in the range of 3.1 to 5.5. There is no focal area of increased metabolic activity. This is nonspecific in appearance and may represent physiologic marrow activity. Impression: \n\n 1. Complete interval resolution of abnormal FDG activity associated with decreasing size of multiple pulmonary nodules as demonstrated on prior study of September 12, 2007. This would be most consistent with resolving pulmonary metastatic disease.\n\n\n2. Small focus of mildly increase FDG activity at the level of rectal resection maybe slightly increased when compared to prior study. This is of uncertain clinical significance and will require continued follow-up.\n\n\nCase 28. Metastatic Cancer in Equine Veterinary Care of Metastatic Melanoma\n\n\nIn addition to the foregoing therapy of case 27, the following components of subject composition are given: (administered by stomach tube) coenzyme Q-IO, an anti-metastatic factor, (spring valley, Nature's Valley, Bohemia, NY) 300 mg, 2 capsules 3 times daily; folic acid, (countering potential deficiency that functions as a co-carcinogen) 800 micrograms, 6 tablets, 3 times daily (Life Extension Boca Raton, FL); and phosphatidyl choline (a hydrophilic surfactant), 1.2 grams, 6 capsules, 3 times daily (Carlson Laboratories, Arlington Heights, IL), with its in-vitro anticancer effect of 88%.\n\n\nIf anticancer response is not adequate with above components, the following will be added:\n\n\nNeocate Infant Formula (with an anticancer in-vitro efficacy of 83% cancer cell kill rate in 24 to 48 hours) with the amino acids specified by the genetic code of targeted developmental protein, such as human breast milk; 6 teaspoons, 3 times daily (SHS\n\n\nInternational, Liverpool, UK and Nutricia Gaithersburg, MD); Bovine Cartilage, 750 mg capsules, 24 capsules, 3 times daily (Phoenix Biologies Vista, CA).\n\n\nPlant derived Cytoplasmic Factor that has a nuclear inhibitory effect, suppresses mitosis in cancer, is ½ fresh carrots and ½ celery prepared in a juicer as a beverage to be given as 32 ounce glasses, 3 times daily.\n\n\nCase 29. Baseline Management of Crohn's Disease\n\n\nPatient was a 76 year old female who had suffered from Crohn's disease for more than three decades. This patient's symptoms included diarrhea, constipation, severe bouts of abdominal pain and fever, G.I. bleeding, generalized aching, extreme fatigue, nausea, and food and dairy intolerance. She was being treated with 4 mg of corticosteroid, once daily, with no response. \n\n At the time, patient had been corticosteroids for approximately 30 years. Corticosteroid dosing was then increased to 4 times daily for acute flare ups.\n\n\nDuring the first decade of management, she was taking Azulfidine, 500mg, one to three times daily with good control. This had to be discontinued due to complication of severe headaches. Two decades ago, flare up was so intense that major abdominal surgery was required, and ten inches of bowel was resected. It is well known that this surgical care, even though extensive, is only symptomatic and does not eradicate the significant predisposition for Crohn's disease with its guarded prognosis. This dilemma was addressed through the following advances in management with progressive improvement, and significant reduction in dosage of corticosteroids. However corticosteroids (particularly long term use as required in this patient's treatment) until the forgoing treatment was developed, have a multiplicity of major side effects. These multiplicities of side effects seen in this patient include extensive bruising, and interference with healing.\n\n\nThese major side effects were addressed by the foregoing treatment which made possible a major reduction of corticosteroid requirements, with control of flare ups and maintenance and prolonged remission.\n\n\nA medicament according to the present invention, was administered to this Crohn's disease patient, comprising about 10.6 g Neocate infant formula SHS Liverpool, UK containing L-amino acids and glycine, in the genetic code and molar ratio of human tissue (breast milk and stem cell human tissue (See Table 4); about 50-100 mg lecithin as de-oiled soy lecithin 40 % phosphatidyl choline (Central Soya. Decatur, 11 now Solae, St. Louis Mo. I; about 12.5-40 mg phosphatidyl choline; Advanced vision research, Woburn, MA Theratears Nutrition, about 225 mg EPA from fish oil; 500 mg flaxseed oil (equivalent to about 275-325 mg linolenic acid); and extracellular matrix components comprising collagen, proteoglycans aggregate complex of cartilage and chondroitin sulfate Cartilage, Quebec, Canada, Atrium Biotechnologies, (shark cartilage 740 mg per capsule, twice daily).\n\n\nProgressive improvement was noted with this formulation, and the patient was able to reduce the corticosteroids by 25% (going from 1 tablet daily to 1 tablet alternating with ½ tablet daily (the major flare-up of Crohn's Disease associated with severe diarrhea and abdominal pain were no longer evident, therefore, the steroids no longer required the count down method of 4 tablets for 1-2/days. 3 tablets for 1-2/days. 2 tablets for 1-2/days). Since achieving this baseline of 25% reduction of steroids; 1 tablet alternating with ½ tablet was administered daily. \n\n The formula includes the following:\n\n\n-1-2 teaspoons Neocate (SHS International, Liverpool, UK)\n\n\n-¼ teaspoon of soy phospholipid as de-oiled Soy Lecithin Powder (Solec, St. Louis, MO) -Four 740 mg 2-3 times daily shark cartilage (Atrium Biologies, Quebec, CA) or a similar dose of bovine cartilage (Phoenix Biologies, Vista, CA)\n\n\n-One Multi -vitamin daily, (Centrum, Madison. NJ or Central- Vite, Eckerd Corporation, Warwick, RI).\n\n\nPatient continued to improve in several weeks to one month. During this time we reduced the steroid dose from alternating 1 tablet and ½ tablet daily. This alternating of 4 mg tablets of corticosteroid medication (Aristocort, Lederle American Cyanamide, NJ, currently marketed by Fujisawa, Deerfield, IL) continued. This was approximately a 25% decrease in steroid usage with good control of Crohn's disease.\n\n\nSubject composition therapeutics was used as a technique and synergistic composition of 1 to 2 teaspoons EO28 2 to 3 times daily as a substitute for Neocate in foregoing synergistic composition for three to four weeks. EO28 palatability was greatly enhanced by emulsifying the product in 3 oz of spring water (Crystal Springs, Paso County, FL., thereby, avoiding 30% noncompliance of distasteful presentation in contrast to the small quantity utilized in patient care presented here by a multiplication of one teeth one to 2 teaspoons of EO28, and 20% were unresponsive probably of this amount of free L-amino acids and glycine (poorly tolerated with the dosage magnitude associated with such increase in absorbable micronutrient particles and associated hyper-osmolar intolerance by the chronically inflamed bowel wall including ileitis). Corticosteroids were reduced by 50 to 75% at this time. Greatest compliance was 1 to 2 teaspoons, 3 times daily. EO28 Extra was compared alone without the Neocate and the findings were better in that approximately 50-75% less steroids were required. With repeated withdrawal and re- addition of Neocate, it was ultimately concluded that the patient was slightly better (about 25%) with the Neocate re-addition. This totaled to a 90% reduction in steroid usage of ½ tablet, 3 times per week. (See Table 4)\n\n\nAlso, 15 grams of free amino acid in the molar ratio as specified by the genetic code per 100 grams of Elemental 028 Extra, unfiavored. Protein equivalent 12.5 grams per 100 grams, Energy kJ (Kcal) 1871 (443). Vitamins, Minerals and Trace Elements per 100 grams. \n\n Vitamin A 330 micro grams, Vitamin D\n3\n 2.5 micro grams, Vitamin E 6.1mg, Vitamin C 28.3mg, Vitamin K 25 micro grams, Thiamin O.όmg, Riboflavin O.όmg, Niacin 4.2mg (mg.

With this addition, the synergism of maintaining Crohn's disease ileitis remission was achieved and maintained. This probiotic appears to displace the more pathogenic saprophytic microorganisms' bowel flora present on the inflamed ileum of the Crohn's ileitis. This provided a more complete synergism in mimicking human tissue, without resorting to the usual dose required (20 to 40 times greater as 20Og, 1 to 2 times daily than the amount used here in this therapeutic synergistic mixture presentation).\n\n\nHowever, there was one side effect of steroid withdrawal: progressively severe arthralgia. This is a common side-effect of steroids reduction after 30 years usage. Arthralgia was almost gone entirely after use of the following:\n\n\n-Four 740 mg shark cartilage (2 to 3 times daily)\n\n\n-Four 740 mg bovine cartilage (2 to 3 times daily)\n\n\n-500 mg Curcurmin (turmeric derived Indian herb) 1 capsule, 2 to 3 times daily (Jarrow Formulas, Los Angeles, CA). This form of tuπneric does not create any burning sensations like the spice does. The patient claimed to feel stronger and more alert as the curcurmin supports the adrenal cortex.\n\n\nThe polymeric proteoglycans were discontinued due to question of sensitization as part of the autoimmune mechanism of arthritis flare-ups. Instead the following were used:\n\n\n-1 ,000 mg MSM (methylsulfonylmethane) 1 capsule, 2 to 3 times daily (Nature's Bounty, Bohemia, NY)\n\n\n-1,000 mg Glucosamine/Chondroitin sulfate 2 capsules 2 to 3 times daily (Life Extension, Ft. Lauderdale, FL)\n\n\nThe following were later added: \n\n -1,000 mg Omega 3 Fish Oil 2 capsules, 2 to 3 times daily (Leiner Health Products, LLC, Carlson, CA)\n\n\n-500 mg Bromelain 1 capsule, 2 to 3 times daily (Natural Factors, Everett, WA)\n\n\n-1,000 mg Garlic 1 capsule, 2 to 3 times daily (Nature's Bounty, Bohemia, NY) -520 mg Panax Ginseng 1 capsule, 2 to 3 times daily (Now Foods, Bloomingdale, IL)\n\n\n-1,000 mg Methyl B 12 1 Lozenge 2 to 3 times daily (J arrow Formulas, Los Angeles, CA)\n\n\n- 400 IU Vitamin D3 1 capsule daily (Jarrow Formulas, Los Angeles, CA)\n\n\nWithout steroids, profuse bleeding with the mildest injury, as well as, constant and severe bruising (ecchymoses) of the forearms was no longer evident. It is believed with this foregoing therapeutic synergism is an effect that approaches 100% remission without the requirement every few months of countdown dosages of corticosteroids starting with 4 tablets 1 to 2 days, and in 3 tablets a day, for 1 to 2 days followed by 2 tablets a day for 2 days and then 1 tablet daily. Inadvertently, the patient received EO28 Extra (SHS International, Liverpool, UK) with a difference in composition of primarily long chain fatty acid fats. The ingestion of one teaspoon of this product was associated with an acute flare up (within a period of five to ten minutes), of severe diarrhea, this was noted several times. In showing the contents to her physician the composition difference was noted and the patient was instructed to re order the EO28 Extra which minimized the fatty acid fats, (correlating with similar clinical gastrointestinal intolerance to the ingestion of fatty foods and improvement with avoidance). By correcting this inadvertent mistake, subsequent use of the EO28 Extra was well tolerated and the experience was looked at as a double blind test, in that neither the patient nor the physician knew about this inadvertent change in composition of EO28 Extra, which was corrected without further side effects.\n\n\nA side effect of withdrawal of prolonged steroids usage over several decades as the occurrence of symptoms of arthralgia without gastrointestinal symptoms flare up which were significantly helped by glucosamine sulfate 500 mg, MSM (methyl sulfonyl methane) 400 mg; chondroitin sulfate 500 mg, (Vitamin Shoppc, North Bergen, NJ) 2 capsules, 2 to 3 times daily; and bovine cartilage 750 mg per capsule four capsules dosage containing bovine tracheal cartilage proteoglycans with chondroitin sulfate 750 mg, type II collagen 720 mg, 2 to 3 times daily Vita Carte, Phoenix Biologies, Vista, California, along with Aristocort 2 \n\n milligrams (1/2 of 4 milligram) tablet daily, initially one half a tablet daily, alternating with 1 tablet daily until arthralgia subsided.\n\n\nIt is believed that the arthritic flare up may be representative of hypersensitivity reaction predisposition. Pertinent childhood history of moderate recurrent arthritis was relieved via elastic bandage wrapping. The predisposition in this patient was apparently masked by the long-term corticosteroid requirements till the development of this subject therapeutic composition. Based on our progressive success with the organizational matrices of therapeutic subject composition, a free amino acid derived from bovine cartilage and its collagen in the hydrolyzed form represents pre-protein precursor targeted extracellular organizational matrix. It is, in a sense biochemically 'invisible', immunologic 'self) derived from bovine cartilage hydrolysate, and would be a significant benefit as 1200 rag collagen hydrolysate dosage per three capsules, Genacol, Blainville, Quebec, Canada three capsules two to three times daily hypoallergenic substitute is used to avert flare up of arthritis manifested by ankle, feet, and hands, with stiffness, and difficulty walking upon awakening in the morning. She continues steroid reductions to approach discontinuance with greatly diminished bruising and occasional injuries are associated with minimal healing disability (currently ½ a tablet daily of Aristocort, Fujisawa).\n\n\nCase 30. Crohn's plus the complication of a wound that failed to heal secondary to leg trauma This intractable wound, wound healing impaired by long term corticosteroids. The therapeutics response that was helpful to both the Crohn's patient and her complication by using this steroid sparing therapeutic subject composition. (See Figure 1OA and 10B)\n\n\nSteroids interfere with healing, an interference that hampers recovery in both the\n\n\nCrohn's Ileitis and wound healing. In 4 weeks of this therapeutic subject application, the wound completely healed, and did not require the full thickness skin graft (with the use of steroids, the patient would have had 2 wounds that would not have healed.) Her Crohn's\n\n\nIleitis continued to improve even with lessened medication.\n\n\nFailure to heal: A component of cell/tissue immune functionality - Similar therapeutic response has been noted in reversing failure to heal the wound accidentally inflicted upon the medial aspect of the lower leg, exemplified by a patient who was being scheduled for a full thickness skin graft.\n\n\nCase example continued with therapeutic subject composition and now including wound healing with therapeutic subject composition. \n\n Patient was scheduled for immediate skin grafting which was averted with the following subject composition therapeutics:\n\n\nFormulation was both ingested orally and applied topically surrounding the wound, in a sterile environment. Results were accomplished after less than a month of application without grafting.\n\n\nNon-surgical Non-steroidal Reversal of Severe Chronic Ileitis (Crohn's Inflammatory Bowel\n\n\nDisease)\n\n\nSimilar responses to subject composition therapeutics have been noticed with Crohn's disease since the foregoing patient was able to lessen the need for corticosteroids by at least\n\n\n50%.\n\n\nThese clinical effects were observed in 4 to 6 weeks with the use of therapeutic components of subject composition therapeutics that have been incorporated in specified formulae and ratios. The formula includes the following given orally, and about ¼ to ½ (half) a teaspoon of each of the foregoing items was applied locally around the wound:\n\n\nNeocate infant formula (SHS International Liverpool UK and currently Nutricia\n\n\nGaithersburg, MD) one to 2 teaspoons emulsified in Zephyrhills Spring water, Paso County\n\n\nFlorida -Four 740 mg 2 to 3 times daily shark cartilage (Atrium Biologies, Quebec, CA) or a similar dose of bovine cartilage. Clinically concluding the bovine cartilage (Phoenix\n\n\nBiologies, Vista, CA) may have been somewhat more effective in the synergism.\n\n\n- !4 teaspoon Soy Lecithin as phospholipid powder (Solec, St. Louis, MO/when first used was (manufactured by Central Soya, Decatur, IL); or most recently: One 1,000 mg phospholipid daily in the form of phosphatidyl choline (Carlson Laboratories, Arlington\n\n\nHeights, IL). One capsule, 2 to 3 times daily.\n\n\n-In the case of trauma, as shown in the progressive major injury of the leg of this patient, this formulation was also used locally in addition to Zinc Oxide Vitamin A&D cream\n\n\n(Schering-Plough Health Care Products, Memphis, TN). -8,000 IU Vitamin A (Pharmavite, LLC, Mission Hills, CA), which was expressed from an open capsule applied around the wound. This was in addition to local care with hydrogen peroxide, compresses, with sterile gauze followed by Bacitracin. \n\n This example describes the foregoing patient case and the onset of her treatment. Her prior treatment of corticosteroids interfered with healing. The systemic and local treatment significantly contributed to the reversal of both wound care and Crohn's disease ileitis. The large dosages of steroids significantly interfered with healing and with wound contraction that we reduced with subject therapeutic composition orally and placed locally around the wound to diffuse into the surrounding tissue to synergize healing and recovery. The present invention therefore, aveited the need for a full thickness skin graft that was prescribed, but not scheduled.\n\n\nThis patient's leg trauma had a major complication due to the management of Crohn's Disease with steroids, as steroids interfere with healing. The patient had spiked her leg with her high heel shoe during a fall, resulting in a deep laceration requiring 23 sutures. Half the sutures sloughed out. The attending plastic surgeon planned a full thickness graft, which the following treatment was able to avert. We developed a cream that was similar to the oral medication. This cream was used locally around the wound (vitamin A was applied directly to the wound). These synergistic components therapeutically mimicked human tissue.\n\n\nSimilar responses to subject composition therapeutics have been noticed with Crohn's disease since the foregoing patient was able to lessen the need for corticosteroids by at least 50%.\n\n\nProlonged use of steroids resulted in a major healing disability in the foregoing case. Thus, subject composition therapeutic steroid sparing had two significant therapeutic benefits, emphasizing its drug safety. In fact, this may be another factor in limiting the healing of Crohn's disease and its chronicity.\n\n\nThe radioactively tagged leukocytes seen radiographically take part in the severe inflammatory changes, which are reversed in 4 weeks and included in subject composition therapeutics. This includes clearance of chemo-attractive inflammatory activity and associated cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL). This is also the response that the organ transplant surgeon is seeking. Radiograph tracking of therapeutic response of patients with radioactively tagged leukocytes.\n\n\nSimilar biochemical anti-inflammatory tracking has been performed with incubation of this subject composition component therapeutic ratio and formula with Crohn\n'\ns diseased, biopsied tissue in 24 hours resulting in reduction of inflammatory cytokine IL-Ib concentration by over 80%. This reduction is significantly greater compared to that seen in normal colonic tissue control. This therapeutic component composition also leads to an \n\n associated relative increase in inflammatory antagonist (inflammatory receptor antagonist, IL-IRA).\n\n\nFailure to heal was associated with prolonged use of corticosteroids for long term management of Crohn's disease when the patient sustained severe trauma to her leg. If a full thickness graft were performed, as suggested by the plastic surgeon, wound healing would now be inflicted upon two areas. Half of the 23 sutures dehisced. The patient responded progressively within 1 month of topical application of subject composition therapeutics which was placed around the wound with the in addition of oral subject composition therapeutics. In view of complete wound healing, without complication of scar, the planned graft was cancelled. Optimizing the treatment of the wound with subject composition therapeutics we found we were at the same time normalizing the Crohn's disease, thereby lessening the need for steroids.\n\n\nEven though the acute use of corticosteroids arrest emergency flair ups of such diseases as inflammatory bowel disease, illustrated by Crohn's ileitis, one wonders that even though this arrested a severe acute flair up did its failure to heal imposition on all the tissues of the body play a role on perpetuating the disease. In fact, this may be another factor in limiting the healing of Crohn's disease and its chromcity. With the foregoing management directed to maximize and optimize her therapeutics in a steroid sparing fashion, she is able to take ½ a of a 4 mg tablet of Aristocort, (2 mg). The least steroids she has required in more than three decades and her steroid complication of bruising is greatly diminished, and injuries that do occur are minimal and easier to manage routinely. Where as, with the past severe trauma that resulted in a wound that wouldn't heal, her tissues seem to have fallen apart more profoundly than one would have expected with the foregoing injury.\n\n\nCase 31 A. Management of Sterility\n\n\nOne patient of child bearing age was treated for management of sterility. (Her husband had a vasectomy repair). She was treated with folic acid, 400 mg daily, and in several months she conceived, at this time she is about 6 months pregnant with uneventful pregnancy. It is important to note, as a continuum of molecular embryogenesis, that this treatment has also been used during pregnancy, to prevent neural tube defect.\n\n\nCase 3 IB. \n\n A mare is being treated with folic acid dosage adjusted since the horse (mare) weighs approximately 6-7 times more than the women seven times the 800 micrograms of folic acid is used per dose and was shipped in plastic packets to be added to Karo syrup to be administered by the equine veterinarian to the horse (mare) for reversal of sterility.\n\n\nCase 31C.\n\n\nSince activation of the ovum response to fertilization is shown to be activated by case 31 it was felt that this activation of the therapeutic stem cell could be accomplished in the same fashion and folic acid powder from the 800 micrograms capsule (Solgar, Leonia, NJ) was included in the transdermal cream. This is to be used in equine veterinarian care to enhance therapeutic response such as but not limited to musculoskeletal diseases. This was shipped for human pilot study trial in one patient that has a neural malfunction secondary to a herniated collapsed lumbar disk impending on the lumbar nerves exiting the spine and going to the leg associated with a foot drop. It is suggested this be used over the malfunctioning nerve in the leg as well as over the spinal area of neural impingement. Note: It is anticipated that this effect might be the same as crushing the vagus nerve with the sheath having within it nutrients that provided reversal of vaguely neuronal activity. This was successful and averted the dumping syndrome when the vagus nerve is transected for complications for a peptic ulcer, (ref. Journal of Physiology, Vol.167 #3 Dec. 1951, L.S. Girsh & M.H.F. Freedman)\n\n\nCase 3 ID.\n\n\nHyaluronic acid Serum (Now, Bloomingdale, IL. spray bottle) added 1-2 sprays per four once bottle of transdermal cream. Prepared for equine veterinarian care and human care for tendonitis and synovitis both are effective and tolerated which we anticipate as a FDA approved component. We will incorporate both for neuromuscular disease, arthritis, tendonitis and synovitis for human use including trauma and ports medicine and equine use for the same indications. Case 32. Chronic Renal Failure Requiring Dialysis\n\n\nIt is believed this effect could be used for possibly saving a patient with chronic kidney disease and renal failure on dialysis treatment weekly as determined by monitoring the blood urea and nitrogen. This increase in blood urea and nitrogen is known as the serious \n\n complication of chronic renal disease, uremia. Urea represents the buildup of the urea waste product of protein metabolism commonly seen in Chronic Renal disease (it is also referred to as pre-renal if the cause is other than renal disease). This dramatic success, using such safe innocuous products for complications of catabolic products of protein metabolism, uric acid in the case of gout, and urea in the case of kidney failure, provides a simplistic therapy for two conditions that have serious disease consequences.\n\n\nA hypertonic foot bath mixture was prepared with about 2 gallons of lukewarm water (is an unusual inflammation, in that it is the only inflammation that does not tolerate hot compresses or baths) in fact, countermanded ½ to 1 cup Epsom salt for example generic, as Publix, 1/8 to 1/4 cup of the remaining ingredients including: Epsotherapy bath treatment (CVS Woonsocket, RI) or Dr. Teal's Epsom Salt (Dr. Teal's Dallas, TX); Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Vigo Tampa, FL); Shower Gel & foaming Bath ( Kiss my face Corp. Gardiner NY): Heal thyself Stress Relief Eucalyptus Basil shower gel (Noah's Naturals LCC Los Angeles, CA); Dead Sea Classics Bath Salts (Crystal Line New York, NY); Natural Mineral Bath, liquid Bath Therapy (Para Laboratories, Homestead, NY); with the optional inclusion of phospholipid phosphatidyl choline 1.2 (Arlington Heights, IL) 3 to 6 capsules opened by cutting away the end of the capsule.\n\n\nCase 33. Atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and its tributaries such as aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease, and/or glomerulonephritic renal damage to avert invasive surgical care\n\n\nIn reconstituting the aorta and its tributaries the extracellular matrix aortic extract is used as the highly purified bovine derived glycosaminoglycans normally present in the order including heparin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and associated hexosaminoglycans. Dosage 100 mg daily to three times a day to reverse atherosclerotic damage and prevent its recurrence along with the prevention of lipid cholesterol plaque deposits and associated lowering of low-density lipoprotein and elevating high density lipoprotein.\n\n\nCase 34. Metastatic Cancer in Equine Veterinary Care of Metastatic Melanoma; also applicable in human melanoma using l/6\nn\n (one sixth) the dosage based on comparative weight ratio of a human to a 1,200 pound horse. \n\n In addition to the foregoing therapy of case 27, the following components of subject composition are given: (administered by stomach tube) (1.) coenzyme Q-IO, an anti- metastatic factor, (spring valley, Nature's Valley, Bohemia, NY) 300 mg, 2 capsules 3 times daily; (2.) folic acid, (countering potential deficiency that functions as a co-carcinogen) 800 micrograms, 6 tablets, 3 times daily (Life Extension Boca Raton, FL); and (3.) phosphatidyl choline (a hydrophilic surfactant), 1.2 grams, 6 capsules, 3 times daily (Carlson Laboratories,\n\n\nArlington Heights, IL), with its in-vitro anticancer effect of 88%. (4.)Plant derived\n\n\nCytoplasmic nuclear inhibitory factor, with the use of ½ carrot, ½ celery prepared in a blender as a juice, thereby releasing this cytoplasmic factor with natural beta carotene; 36 ounces.\n\n\nIf anticancer response is not adequate with above components, the following will be added:\n\n\nNeocate Infant Formula (with an anticancer in-vitro efficacy of 83% cancer cell kill rate in 24 to 48 hours) with the amino acids specified by the genetic code of targeted developmental protein, such as human breast milk; 6 teaspoons, 3 times daily (SHS\n\n\nInternational, Liverpool, UK and Nutricia Gaithersburg, MD); Bovine Cartilage, 750 mg capsules, 24 capsules, 3 times daily (Phoenix Biologies Vista, CA).\n\n\nPlant derived Cytoplasmic Factor that has a nuclear inhibitory effect, suppresses mitosis in cancer, is V2 fresh carrots and V2 celery prepared in a juicer as a beverage to be given as 36 ounce glasses, 3 times daily.\n\n\nCase 35: Immunotherapeutic response and disease resolution of the most resistant infections of E.coli septicemia:\n\n\nA patient in his late 70s documented as a post-operative complication of E.coli septicemia with a 50% mortality rate, a complication following surgical removal of gangrenous gallbladder septicemia cholecysitis and cholelithiasis and also effective in regard to resistant fungal infections. The addition of riboflavin l OOmg daily produced prompt clinical response of relief of fatigue and improvement and well being in addition to Clindamycin and Azactam intravenously as a out patient over three weeks. This treatment was based on an animal model of experimental septicemia (Azactam 2 grams daily and Clindomycin .9 grams reduced to .6 every eight hours this was required for sixteen days) in the mouse with a 90% mortality rate which was improved to a 10% mortality rate with the use of riboflavin (B2). These observations were further based upon animal model responses \n\n with the bio-material component composition of the immunotherapeutics of the subject and related applications that further includes viral, fungal, protozoa and other foreign organisms infectious disease reversal.\n\n\nThe bioelectric phenomena present in all tissue, is highly dependent upon subject compositions therapeutics organizational membrane matrix of phospholipid such as phosphatidyl choline and Omega-3 essential fatty acid fats (derived from fish oil and seed oils such as flax seed oil) found concentrated in this layer. The 3 alternating double bonds of the Omega-3 fatty acid fats generate a very similar pi electron cloud as the benzene ring but with out the toxicity of benzene and benzene ring compounds. The biologic competition that arc tissue integrity and innate immunity provide equivalent to 6,974,796 Bl is explained by the ability of omega three fatty acid fats (such as fish oil and seed oil) to hold oxygen in our cell membranes where the oxygen acts as a barrier to micro-organisms such as fungi, viruses, bacteria and other foreign organisms that can not thrive in its presence. Animal studies have shown that this adds to the omega three fatty acid fats ability to kill malaria based on animal studies and successful use as we have shown here in the treatment of staph bacterial infections including antibiotic resistance staph infections. The omega three fatty acid fats are also helpful and involved in making oxygen available to out tissues by activating oxygen molecules by way of their electrostatic forces. This biologic infectious disease protective competition is further explained in that the micro-organisms for the most part are anaerobic similar to cancer tissue, where as normal tissue functions at a aerobic level with ten times more oxygen utilization and energy release that the foregoing abnormal disease cell line.\n\n\nThese 3 alternating double bonds have the added safety and effective advantages in that this effect is similar to the safety found in the aromatic amino acids (tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine) compatible with this 3-D stereo fit of all amino acids into protoplasmic protein cell biology models and of human and mammalian tissue. This is in contrast to the sliding action of one chemical upon the other in the cause of benzene ring compounds other than these biologic exceptions. They additionally move as delocalized pi electron bonds along the chain of the fatty acid. These electron clouds can form phase boundary potentials like the charges of static electricity in a capacitor. This bio electric capacitor is best exemplified by the phospholipids such as, phosphatidyl choline bilamellar liquid crystal micelle. This static electrical charge on the hydrophilic bilamellar outside layers creates this capacitor static electrical storage effect with the lipid hydrophobic insulating effect separation. \n\n This biologic competitive edge to disease cell lines is also seem with a highly sulfated extracellular matrix glycoproteins and monomers such as chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine sulfate. A further competitive edge is seen in that all L-amino acids of human and mammalian tissue specified by the genetic code of human tissue are L or non-chiral glycine whereas micro-organisms amino acids have D amino acids.\n\n\nThis biologic competitive edge to disease cell lines is seen in the cell membrane of phosphatidyl choline of human and mammalian tissue whereas micro-organisms have no phosphatidyl choline.\n\n\nThis biologic competitive edge to disease cell lines is also seen with the advantages of selenium in countering virulent influenza strains as additional findings of the advantages of normal selenium levels in reducing the risk of cancer\n\n\n(Case 36: Immunotherapeutic response and disease resolution of the most resistant infections of resistant staphylococcus: A woman in mid 70s with a second bout of antibiotic resistance Staph. Aureus infection in her left groin which was acutely inflamed, tender and swollen. She responded promptly with therapeutic subject composition as reported in the patent office declaration in addition to the same therapeutic composition as the transdermal cream around the wound and 2% mupirocin for dermatologic use (Teva Pharmaceuticals, Israel and Sellersville, PA.). This rapidly improved with drainage of 5-10 cc of purulent grey-green viscous drainage fine linear drainage point that sealed spontaneously. Progressive improvement over 7-10 days. This effect was associated with expedient recovery and achieving symptom free status in 24/48 hours in contrast to the same lesion that occurred two years ago and was surgically drained and required hot baths and home nursing care for several weeks. Resistance staph manifested by an abscess in the left vulvar (5-6 cm in diameter) area not responsive to erythromycin ointment and erythromycin orally (supplied respectively by Abbott Pharmaceutical Company, Chicago, II. as erythromycin ointment and erystat 333mg bid) This occurred in a female patient in her late 70 's whose healing capacity was compromised by coexistent Crohn's disease and the need for cortico- steroids the aristocort ½ of 4mg tablet was reduced daily to a ½ a tablet three times weekly lessening the interference of healing. She responded to the transdermal treatment around the wound, warm compresses followed by mupirocin (Teva Pharmaceuticals) and 6,974,796 Bl therapy (same as the treatment used in the declaration). After 48-72 hours of treatment the abscess drained from an \n\n open about 1/3 of a centimeter in size, about lOcc of frank purulent of a grayish/green color.\n\n\nThis continued to drain (a few cc of diluted bloody drainage from the granulation tissue).\n\n\nAfter a week of the foregoing treatment the tissues returned to normal without any drainage.\n\n\nTwo-three years ago patient required surgical care and drainage for a similar problem. Patient at this time refused surgical care due to the pain involved with the past surgical drainage and gave permission to use the foregoing treatment which she responded excellently to.\n\n\nTreatment is presented in the literature in providing successful treatment for resistance staph.\n\n\nThis has been effective in 50% of patients without the advantage of this complete therapeutic approach.\n\n\nIn our research regarding nutrient deficiency in viral diseases such as influenza I found micronutrient deficiencies of selenium and zinc. Perhaps these micronutrieiit deficiencies might be considered by your attending doctor contained in such over-the-counter capsules as Carlson, Super 2 Daily, Arlington Heights, IL. (selenomethionine 200mcg and zinc gluconate 15mg). Treatment included in the synergy of the subject composition mimicking human tissue and human tissue healing capacity to be included with above zinc and selenium.\n\n\nCase 37: Pain management in helping with pain resolution in peripheral neuropathy: The male patient, a scientist, age 57, incurred an accident when age 30. He was playing ice hockey in Canada and he was bent in half as a goalie by another player who came crashing in and compressed his L4/L5 vertebra disc compression at age 30 against the metal frame of the hockey goal post. The past four years it has been observed by x-ray and MRI that he has a crushed vertebral disk, which has been the cause of his bi-lateral pain especially on the left side. In the past year he has been awakened every night in pain and he has an abnormal sensation of numbness and coldness in both feet has progressively improved since he has been using this transdermal cream one to two times per day particularly at bedtime.\n\n\nWith the use of the transdermal cream, his nocturnal pain cleared and did not waken him 5 out of the 7 night.

The present invention also relates to a method for maintaining a state after treatment of a disease, comprising a step of administering an antibody recognizing HLA class I to a subject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　HLAは外来性の抗原、細菌、ウィルス感染細胞等を異物と認識し除去する免疫反応において重要な分子である。HLA分子の主な役割は、細胞の中で作られる8～10残基程度のアミノ酸でできた抗原ペプチドをCD8+T細胞に提示することであり、これによって誘導される免疫応答や免疫寛容に非常に重要な役割を担っている。HLAは、α1～3の３つのドメインからなる45KDのα鎖と12KDのβ2マイクログロブリン（β2M）のヘテロダイマーによって形成されるクラスIと、α1、α2の２つのドメインからなる30～34KDのα鎖とβ1、β2の２つのドメインからなる26～29KDのβ鎖のヘテロダイマーによって形成されるクラスIIに分類される。さらに、HLAクラスI（HLA-I）には、HLA-A、B、C等の存在が知られている(以下において、HLA-Aを「HLAクラスI A（HLA-IA）」とも称する)。\n\n\nHLA is an important molecule in the immune reaction that recognizes foreign antigens, bacteria, virus-infected cells, etc. as foreign substances and removes them. The main role of the HLA molecule is to present to the CD8 + T cells an antigenic peptide consisting of about 8 to 10 amino acids made in the cell. It plays a very important role. HLA is a class I formed by a 45 KD α chain consisting of three domains of α1 to 3 and a heterodimer of 12 KD β2 microglobulin (β2M), and an α of 30 to 34 KDa consisting of two domains of α1 and α2. It is classified into class II formed by a heterodimer of 26-29 KD β chain consisting of a chain and two domains of β1 and β2. Furthermore, HLA class I (HLA-I) is known to have HLA-A, B, C, etc. (hereinafter, HLA-A is also referred to as “HLA class I A (HLA-IA)”) .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　これまでに、リンパ球細胞において抗HLAクラスI A抗体によるライゲーションで、細胞増殖抑制効果や細胞死誘導効果が報告されており、HLA分子のシグナル伝達分子としての可能性が示唆されている。例えばヒトHLAクラスI Aのα1ドメインに対する抗体B9.12.1、α2ドメインに対する抗体W6/32、α3ドメインに対する抗体TP25.99, A1.4は、活性化リンパ球に対して細胞増殖を抑制するとの報告がある（非特許文献１、２）。また、α1ドメインに対する二種類の抗体MoAb90、YTH862は、活性化リンパ球に対してアポトーシスを誘導することが報告されている（非特許文献２、３、４）。この２つの抗体によって誘導されるアポトーシスはカスパーゼを介した反応であることが明らかにされており（非特許文献４）、このことからリンパ球細胞で発現するHLAクラスI Aは、アポトーシスの信号伝達にも関与していると推測されている。\n\n\nSo far, ligation with anti-HLA class IA antibodies in lymphocyte cells has been reported to inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell death, suggesting the possibility of HLA molecules as signaling molecules. For example, reports that antibody B9.12.1 against α1 domain of human HLA class I A, antibody W6 / 32 against α2 domain, antibody TP25.99 against α3 domain, and A1.4 suppress cell proliferation against activated lymphocytes. (Non-Patent \nDocuments\n 1 and 2). Two types of antibodies against the α1 domain, MoAb90 and YTH862, have been reported to induce apoptosis on activated lymphocytes (Non-Patent \n \nDocuments\n \n 2, 3, and 4). Apoptosis induced by these two antibodies has been clarified to be a caspase-mediated reaction (Non-patent Document 4). From this, HLA class I で A expressed in lymphocyte cells is a signal transducing apoptosis. It is speculated that it is also involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　さらに、ヒトHLAクラスI Aのα3ドメインに対する抗体 5H7（非特許文献５）、マウスMHCクラスIのα2ドメインに対する抗体RE2（非特許文献６）も、活性化リンパ球などに細胞死を誘導することが報告されている。\n\n\nFurthermore, antibody H5H7 against the α3 domain of human HLA class I A (non-patent document 5) and antibody RE2 against the α2 domain of mouse MHC class I (non-patent document 6) also induce cell death in activated lymphocytes and the like. Has been reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　ヒト骨髄腫細胞を免疫して得られたモノクローナル抗体2D7（非特許文献８）も、HLAクラスI Aを認識する抗体であり、該2D7を低分子化（diabody化）することにより、ヒト骨髄腫細胞株に対して短時間で激しい細胞死を誘導することが報告されている。また、ヒトHLAクラスIAと、ヒトβ2Mを共発現させた細胞をマウスに免疫して得られたモノクローナル抗体C3B3（特許文献５）はHLAクラスI抗原のα2ドメインを認識する抗体であり、抗マウスIgG抗体とクロスリンクすることにより、強い細胞傷害活性を示す。さらにこのC3B3抗体を低分子化抗体（C3B3 diabody）へと改変することにより、C3B3 diabody (C3B3-DB)単独で2D7 diabody単独よりも強い抗腫瘍作用を示した（特許文献５）。\n\n\nMonoclonal antibody 2D7 (Non-patent Document 8) obtained by immunizing human myeloma cells is also an antibody that recognizes HLA class I A, and by reducing the molecular weight (diabody) of 2D7, human myeloma It has been reported to induce severe cell death in a short time against cell lines. In addition, monoclonal antibody C3B3 (Patent Document 5) obtained by immunizing mice with cells co-expressing human HLA class IA and human β2M is an antibody that recognizes the α2 domain of HLA class I antigen, and is anti-mouse. Strong cytotoxic activity by cross-linking with IgG antibody. Furthermore, by modifying this C3B3 antibody into a low molecular weight antibody (C3B3 diabody), C3B3 diabody (C3B3-DB) alone showed stronger antitumor action than 2D7 diabody alone (Patent Document 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　2D7 diabodyおよびC3B3 diabodyは、各種ヒト骨髄腫細胞株、および、活性化リンパ球細胞に対して強い細胞死誘導活性を示し、マウスにヒト骨髄腫細胞株を移植した多発性骨髄腫モデルマウスにおいても、有意な延命効果を示したことから、骨髄腫治療薬として開発が進められている(特許文献１～５、非特許文献７)。このような、HLAクラスI関与の細胞死誘導を利用した治療をさらに発展させれば、骨髄腫等に対する有効性の高い医薬品が開発されるものと期待される。\n\n\n2D7 diabody and C3B3 diabody show strong cell death-inducing activity against various human myeloma cell lines and activated lymphocyte cells, and in multiple myeloma model mice transplanted with human myeloma cell lines. Since it showed a significant life-prolonging effect, it has been developed as a therapeutic agent for myeloma (\nPatent Documents\n 1 to 5, Non-Patent Document 7). If such treatment using cell death induction involving HLA class I is further developed, it is expected that highly effective pharmaceuticals for myeloma and the like will be developed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　血液癌や多発性骨髄腫では化学療法が効果的であり、化学療法を続けることにより血中や骨髄において癌細胞が確認されない状態にすることが可能である。しかしながら、血液癌や骨髄腫においては、このように癌細胞が確認されなくなった場合であっても、一定期間経過後に癌が再発することがある。これは、化学療法により血液癌や骨髄腫が完治されたように見えても、実際には癌幹細胞が存在しており、一定期間を経過した後にこの癌幹細胞が増殖して、癌が再発すると考えられている。癌の再発を抑制するために癌細胞が確認されなくなった後も薬剤の投与を継続する維持療法が行われることがあるが、癌幹細胞に対しては従来の化学療法剤は効果が低いと考えられており、今までのところ癌幹細胞に対して治療効果の高い薬剤は報告されていない。\n\n\nChemotherapy is effective for blood cancer and multiple myeloma, and it is possible to make cancer cells not confirmed in blood or bone marrow by continuing chemotherapy. However, in blood cancer and myeloma, even when cancer cells are no longer confirmed in this way, cancer may recur after a certain period of time. This is because even though hematological cancer and myeloma seem to be completely cured by chemotherapy, cancer stem cells actually exist, and after a certain period of time, the cancer stem cells proliferate and the cancer recurs. It is considered. Maintenance therapy that continues drug administration after cancer cells are no longer confirmed to prevent cancer recurrence may be performed, but conventional chemotherapeutic agents are considered to be less effective against cancer stem cells So far, no drug with high therapeutic effect on cancer stem cells has been reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWO2004/033499\nWO2004 / 033499\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWO2005/056603\nWO2005 / 056603\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWO2005/100560\nWO2005 / 100560\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWO2006/123724\nWO2006 / 123724\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPCT/JP2007/063946\nPCT / JP2007 / 063946\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　本発明はこのような状況に鑑みてなされたものであり、その目的は、骨髄腫等に対する有効性の高い医薬品を提供することにある。より具体的には本発明は、骨髄腫等の癌の再発を予防するための維持療法用医薬組成物を提供することを課題とする。また、骨髄腫等の癌の治療後の状態を維持する方法を提供することを課題とする。\n\n\nThe present invention has been made in view of such a situation, and an object thereof is to provide a highly effective pharmaceutical agent for myeloma and the like. More specifically, an object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for maintenance therapy for preventing recurrence of cancer such as myeloma. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for maintaining a state after treatment of cancer such as myeloma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　本発明者らは上記の課題を解決するために、腫瘍細胞のSP(side-population) fractionに対する細胞障害活性を検討することにより、抗HLAクラスI抗体が骨髄腫等の疾患の維持療法に有効であるか否か検討した。\n\n\nIn order to solve the above problems, the present inventors investigated the cytotoxic activity against SP (side-population) fraction of tumor cells, so that anti-HLA class I antibodies are effective for maintenance therapy of diseases such as myeloma. It was examined whether or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　まず本発明者らは、腫瘍細胞のSP fractionとnon-SP fraction の双方において、HLA-Aが高発現していることを確認した。このことから本発明者らは、これらの細胞が抗HLAクラスI抗体の治療標的となりうると考えた。\n\n　また本発明者らは、腫瘍細胞のSP fractionはnon-SP fractionと比較し、薬剤耐性に関与するABC transporterの１種であるABCG2を細胞表面に高発現していることを確認した。さらに本発明者らは、SP fractionはnon-SP fractionよりも増殖速度が遅いことを確認した。これらのことから本発明者らは、SP fractionは薬剤耐性でdormantなcancer stem cellに類似した特徴を有していると考え、SP fractionに対する抗HLAクラスI抗体の効果の検討を試みた。\n\nFirst, the present inventors confirmed that HLA-A was highly expressed in both the SP fraction and non-SP fraction of tumor cells. From this, the present inventors considered that these cells could be therapeutic targets for anti-HLA class I antibodies. \n The present inventors also confirmed that ABCG2, which is one type of ABC transporter involved in drug resistance, is highly expressed on the cell surface as compared with the non-SP fraction in the SP fraction of tumor cells. Furthermore, the present inventors have confirmed that the SP fraction has a slower growth rate than the non-SP fraction. Based on these facts, the present inventors considered that SP fraction has characteristics similar to drug-resistant and dormant cancer stem cells, and tried to examine the effect of anti-HLA class I antibodies on SP fraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　本発明者らは、抗HLAクラスI抗体の存在下でSP fractionおよびnon-SP fractionの培養を行った結果、SP fraction、non-SP fractionの双方において、細胞数が減少することを確認した。一方、抗HLAクラスI抗体の非存在下においては、non-SP fractionでは細胞数の減少が見られるものの、SP fractionでは細胞数に変化が見られないことを確認した。\n\n　さらに本発明者らは、抗HLAクラスI抗体がSP fraction、non-SP fractionの双方に対し、強い細胞障害活性を示すことを確認した。\n\nAs a result of culturing SP fraction and non-SP fraction in the presence of anti-HLA class I antibody, the present inventors have confirmed that the number of cells is decreased in both SP fraction and non-SP fraction. On the other hand, in the absence of anti-HLA class I antibody, it was confirmed that the cell number decreased in the non-SP fraction, but no change was observed in the SP fraction. \n Furthermore, the present inventors have confirmed that anti-HLA class I antibodies exhibit strong cytotoxic activity against both SP fraction and non-SP fraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　このように本発明者らは、抗HLAクラスI抗体が腫瘍細胞のnon-SP fractionのみならずSP fractionに対しても細胞傷害を誘導することを明らかにした。本発明者らは、従来の抗癌剤治療後に抗HLAクラスI抗体による治療を追加することにより、残存する抗癌剤抵抗性のcancer stem cellを障害し、再発を抑制につながる維持療法として効果が期待できるものと考え、本発明を完成するに至った。即ち本発明は、以下〔１〕～〔２５〕を提供するものである。\n\n〔１〕HLAクラスIを認識する抗体を有効成分として含有する、維持療法用医薬組成物。\n\n〔２〕骨髄腫または血液癌における維持療法に用いられることを特徴とする〔１〕に記載の医薬組成物。\n\n〔３〕骨髄腫または血液癌の治療後に用いられることを特徴とする〔２〕に記載の医薬組成物。\n\n〔４〕骨髄腫または血液癌の再発防止のために用いられる〔３〕に記載の医薬組成物。\n\n〔５〕HLAクラスIを認識する抗体がHLA-Aを認識する抗体である〔１〕～〔４〕いずれかに記載の医薬組成物。\n\n〔６〕HLAクラスIを認識する抗体を対象に投与する工程を含む、疾患の治療後の状態を維持する方法。\n\n〔７〕疾患が骨髄腫または血液癌である、〔６〕に記載の方法。\n\n〔８〕抗体が骨髄腫または血液癌の治療後に投与される、〔７〕に記載の方法。\n\n〔９〕抗体が骨髄腫または血液癌の再発防止のために投与される、〔８〕に記載の方法。\n\n〔１０〕HLAクラスIを認識する抗体がHLA-Aを認識する抗体である〔６〕～〔９〕いずれかに記載の方法。\n\n〔１１〕維持療法用医薬組成物を製造するための、HLAクラスIを認識する抗体の使用。\n\n〔１２〕医薬組成物が骨髄腫または血液癌の維持療法に用いられる、〔１１〕に記載の使用。\n\n〔１３〕医薬組成物が骨髄腫または血液癌の治療後に用いられる、〔１２〕に記載の使用。\n\n〔１４〕医薬組成物が骨髄腫または血液癌の再発防止のために用いられる、〔１３〕に記載の使用。\n\n〔１５〕HLAクラスIを認識する抗体がHLA-Aを認識する抗体である〔１１〕～〔１４〕いずれかに記載の使用。\n\n〔１６〕疾患の治療後の状態を維持するために用いられる（疾患の維持療法のために用いられる）、HLAクラスIを認識する抗体。\n\n〔１７〕疾患が骨髄腫または血液癌である、〔１６〕に記載の抗体。\n\n〔１８〕骨髄腫または血液癌の治療後に用いられる、〔１７〕に記載の抗体。\n\n〔１９〕骨髄腫または血液癌の再発防止のために用いられる、〔１８〕に記載の抗体。\n\n〔２０〕HLAクラスIを認識する抗体がHLA-Aを認識する抗体である〔１６〕～〔１９〕いずれかに記載の抗体。\n\n〔２１〕疾患の治療後の状態を維持するための、HLAクラスIを認識する抗体の使用。\n\n〔２２〕疾患が骨髄腫または血液癌である、〔２１〕に記載の使用。\n\n〔２３〕骨髄腫または血液癌の治療後に用いられる、〔２２〕に記載の使用。\n\n〔２４〕骨髄腫または血液癌の再発防止のために用いられる、〔２３〕に記載の使用。\n\n〔２５〕HLAクラスIを認識する抗体がHLA-Aを認識する抗体である〔２１〕～〔２４〕いずれかに記載の使用。\n\nThus, the present inventors have revealed that anti-HLA class I antibody induces cytotoxicity not only to the non-SP fraction of tumor cells but also to the SP fraction. The inventors of the present invention can be expected to be effective as a maintenance therapy that damages the remaining anticancer drug resistant cancer stem cells by adding treatment with anti-HLA class I antibody after conventional anticancer drug treatment and leads to suppression of recurrence.

HLA molecules are classified into class I and class II. As class I, HLA-A, B, C, E, F, G, H, J and the like are known. The antigen recognized by the antibody of the present invention is not particularly limited as long as it is a molecule classified as HLA class I, but is preferably HLA class IA, and more preferably HLA class IA α1 domain and / or α2 domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　本発明における抗体の由来は特に限定されるものではないが、好ましくは哺乳動物由来であり、より好ましくはマウス由来の抗体またはヒト由来の抗体を挙げることができる。本発明に用いられるHLAクラスIを認識する抗体（抗HLAクラスI抗体）は、HLAクラスIに特異的に結合することが好ましい。\n\n\nThe origin of the antibody in the present invention is not particularly limited, but is preferably derived from a mammal, more preferably a mouse-derived antibody or a human-derived antibody. The antibody that recognizes HLA class I (anti-HLA class I antibody) used in the present invention preferably binds specifically to HLA class I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　本発明で使用される抗HLAクラスI抗体は、公知の手段を用いてポリクローナルまたはモノクローナル抗体として得ることができる。本発明で使用される抗HLAクラスI抗体として、特に哺乳動物由来のモノクローナル抗体が好ましい。哺乳動物由来のモノクローナル抗体としては、ハイブリドーマに産生される抗体、遺伝子工学的手法により抗体遺伝子を含む発現ベクターで形質転換した宿主に産生される抗体、等がある。\n\n　このような抗体の例としては、C3B3抗体（WO2008/007755）や、2D7抗体（Kimura, et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun., 325: 1201-1209 (2004)）等が挙げられるが、これらに限定されない。\n\nAnti-HLA class I antibodies used in the present invention can be obtained as polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies using known means. As the anti-HLA class I antibody used in the present invention, a monoclonal antibody derived from a mammal is particularly preferable. Mammal-derived monoclonal antibodies include antibodies produced by hybridomas, antibodies produced by hosts transformed with expression vectors containing antibody genes by genetic engineering techniques, and the like. \n Examples of such antibodies include C3B3 antibody (WO2008 / 007755) and 2D7 antibody (Kimura, et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun., 325: 1201-1209 (2004)). It is not limited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　抗HLAクラスI抗体産生ハイブリドーマは、基本的には公知技術を使用し、以下のようにして作製できる。すなわち、HLAクラスIを感作抗原として使用して、これを通常の免疫方法に従って免疫し、得られる免疫細胞を通常の細胞融合法によって公知の親細胞と融合させ、通常のスクリーニング法により、モノクローナルな抗体産生細胞をスクリーニングすることによって作製できる。抗原の調製は公知の方法、例えばバキュロウィルスを用いた方法（WO98/46777など）等に準じて行うことができる。また、HLAクラスIの遺伝子配列を公知の発現ベクター系に挿入して適当な宿主細胞を形質転換させた後、その宿主細胞中または、培養上清中から目的のHLAクラスI分子を公知の方法で精製し、この精製HLAクラスI蛋白質を感作抗原として用いることもできる。また、HLAクラスI分子と他の蛋白質との融合蛋白質を感作抗原として用いてもよい。\n\n\nAn anti-HLA class I antibody-producing hybridoma can be basically produced using a known technique as follows. That is, using HLA class I as a sensitizing antigen, this is immunized according to a normal immunization method, the resulting immune cells are fused with a known parent cell by a normal cell fusion method, and a monoclonal antibody is obtained by a normal screening method. It is possible to prepare by screening for an antibody-producing cell. The antigen can be prepared according to a known method, for example, a method using a baculovirus (WO98 / 46777 etc.). In addition, after transforming an appropriate host cell by inserting an HLA class I gene sequence into a known expression vector system, the desired HLA class I molecule is obtained from the host cell or culture supernatant by a known method. The purified HLA class I protein can be used as a sensitizing antigen. Further, a fusion protein of an HLA class I molecule and another protein may be used as a sensitizing antigen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　感作抗原で免疫される哺乳動物としては、特に限定されるものではないが、細胞融合に使用する親細胞との適合性を考慮して選択するのが好ましく、一般的にはげっ歯類の動物、例えば、マウス、ラット、ハムスター等が使用される。\n\n　感作抗原による動物の免疫は、公知の方法に従って行われる。例えば、一般的方法として、感作抗原を哺乳動物の腹腔内または、皮下に注射することにより行われる。具体的には、感作抗原をPBS（Phosphate-Buffered Saline ）や生理食塩水等で適当量に希釈、懸濁したものを所望により通常のアジュバント、例えば、フロイント完全アジュバントを適量混合し、乳化後、哺乳動物に4-21日毎に数回投与するのが好ましい。また、感作抗原免疫時に適当な担体を使用することができる。\n\n　このように免疫し、血清中に所望の抗体レベルが上昇するのを確認した後に、哺乳動物から免疫細胞が取り出され、細胞融合に付される。細胞融合に付される好ましい免疫細胞としては、特に脾細胞が挙げられる。\n\nThe mammal to be immunized with the sensitizing antigen is not particularly limited, but is preferably selected in consideration of compatibility with the parent cell used for cell fusion. Animals such as mice, rats, hamsters and the like are used. \n The animal is immunized with the sensitizing antigen according to a known method. For example, as a general method, it is performed by injecting a sensitizing antigen intraperitoneally or subcutaneously into a mammal. Specifically, the sensitizing antigen is diluted to an appropriate amount with PBS (Phosphate-Buffered Saline) or physiological saline and suspended, and then mixed with an appropriate amount of an ordinary adjuvant, for example, Freund's complete adjuvant, after emulsification. Preferably, it is administered to mammals several times every 4-21 days. In addition, an appropriate carrier can be used during immunization with the sensitizing antigen. \n After immunizing in this way and confirming that the desired antibody level rises in the serum, immune cells are removed from the mammal and subjected to cell fusion. Spleen cells are particularly preferred as preferable immune cells to be subjected to cell fusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　前記免疫細胞と融合される他方の親細胞としての哺乳動物のミエローマ細胞は、すでに、公知の種々の細胞株、例えば、P3X63Ag8.653（Kearney, J. F. et al. J. Immunol. (1979) 123, 1548-1550）、P3X63Ag8U.1 （Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology (1978) 81, 1-7) 、NS-1（Kohler. G. and Milstein, C. Eur. J. Immunol.(1976) 6, 511-519 ）、MPC-11（Margulies. D. H. et al., Cell (1976) 8, 405-415 ）、SP2/0 （Shulman, M. et al., Nature (1978) 276, 269-270）、FO（de St. Groth, S. F. et al., J. Immunol. Methods (1980) 35, 1-21 ）、S194（Trowbridge, I. S. J. Exp. Med. (1978) 148, 313-323）、R210（Galfre, G. et al., Nature (1979) 277, 131-133 ）等が適宜使用される。\n\n　前記免疫細胞とミエローマ細胞の細胞融合は基本的には公知の方法、例えば、ミルシュタインらの方法（Kohler. G. and Milstein, C. 、Methods Enzymol. (1981) 73, 3-46）等に準じて行うことができる。\n\n　より具体的には、前記細胞融合は例えば、細胞融合促進剤の存在下に通常の栄養培養液中で実施される。融合促進剤としては例えば、ポリエチレングリコール（PEG）、センダイウィルス（HVJ）等が使用され、さらに所望により融合効率を高めるためにジメチルスルホキシド等の補助剤を添加使用することもできる。\n\nMammalian myeloma cells as the other parental cells to be fused with the immune cells are already known in various cell lines such as P3X63Ag8.653 (Kearney, JF et al. J. Immunol. (1979) 123, 1548-1550), P3X63Ag8U.1 (Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology (1978) 81, 1-7), NS-1 (Kohler. G. and Milstein, C. Eur. J. Immunol. (1976) 6, 511 -519), MPC-11 (Margulies. DH et al., Cell (1976) 8, 405-415), SP2 / 0 (Shulman, M. et al., Nature (1978) 276, 269-270), FO (De St. Groth, SF et al., J. Immunol. Methods (1980) 35, 1-21), S194 (Trowbridge, ISJ Exp. Med. (1978) 148, 313-323), R210 (Galfre, G et al., Nature (1979) 277, 131-133) are used as appropriate. \n The cell fusion between the immune cells and myeloma cells is basically performed by a known method such as the method of Milstein et al. (Kohler. G. and Milstein, C., Methods Enzymol. (1981) 73, 3-46). It can be done according to this. \n More specifically, the cell fusion is performed, for example, in a normal nutrient culture medium in the presence of a cell fusion promoter. For example, polyethylene glycol (PEG), Sendai virus (HVJ), or the like is used as the fusion accelerator, and an auxiliary agent such as dimethyl sulfoxide can be added and used to increase the fusion efficiency as desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　免疫細胞とミエローマ細胞との使用割合は、例えば、ミエローマ細胞に対して免疫細胞を1～10倍とするのが好ましい。前記細胞融合に用いる培養液としては、例えば、前記ミエローマ細胞株の増殖に好適なRPMI1640培養液、MEM培養液、その他、この種の細胞培養に用いられる通常の培養液が使用可能であり、さらに、牛胎児血清（FCS）等の血清補液を併用することもできる。\n\n　細胞融合は、前記免疫細胞とミエローマ細胞との所定量を前記培養液中でよく混合し、予め、37℃程度に加温したPEG溶液、例えば、平均分子量1000～6000程度のPEG溶液を通常、30～60％（w/v）の濃度で添加し、混合することによって目的とする融合細胞（ハイブリドーマ）が形成される。続いて、適当な培養液を逐次添加し、遠心して上清を除去する操作を繰り返すことによりハイブリドーマの生育に好ましくない細胞融合剤等を除去できる。\n\n　当該ハイブリドーマは、通常の選択培養液、例えば、HAT培養液（ヒポキサンチン、アミノプテリンおよびチミジンを含む培養液）で培養することにより選択される。当該HAT培養液での培養は、目的とするハイブリドーマ以外の細胞（非融合細胞）が死滅するのに十分な時間、通常数日～数週間継続する。次いで、通常の限界希釈法を実施し、目的とする抗体を産生するハイブリドーマのスクリーニングおよびクローニングが行われる。\n\n　このようにして作製されるモノクローナル抗体を産生するハイブリドーマは、通常の培養液中で継代培養することが可能であり、また、液体窒素中で長期保存することが可能である。\n\nThe usage ratio of immune cells and myeloma cells is preferably, for example, 1 to 10 times as many immune cells as that of myeloma cells. As the culture medium used for the cell fusion, for example, RPMI1640 culture medium suitable for growth of the myeloma cell line, MEM culture medium, and other normal culture liquids used for this type of cell culture can be used. Serum supplements such as fetal calf serum (FCS) can be used in combination. \n In cell fusion, a predetermined amount of the immune cells and myeloma cells are mixed well in the culture solution, and a PEG solution pre-warmed to about 37 ° C., for example, a PEG solution having an average molecular weight of about 1000 to 6000 is usually used. The target fused cell (hybridoma) is formed by adding and mixing at a concentration of 30 to 60% (w / v). Subsequently, cell fusion agents and the like that are undesirable for the growth of the hybridoma can be removed by adding an appropriate culture solution successively and centrifuging to remove the supernatant. \n The hybridoma is selected by culturing in a normal selective culture solution, for example, a HAT culture solution (a culture solution containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine). Culturing with the HAT culture solution is continued for a time sufficient for the cells other than the target hybridoma (non-fused cells) to die, usually several days to several weeks. Subsequently, a normal limiting dilution method is performed, and screening and cloning of hybridomas producing the target antibody are performed. \n The hybridoma producing the monoclonal antibody thus produced can be subcultured in a normal culture solution, and can be stored for a long time in liquid nitrogen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　当該ハイブリドーマからモノクローナル抗体を取得するには、当該ハイブリドーマを通常の方法にしたがい培養し、その培養上清として得る方法、あるいはハイブリドーマをこれと適合性がある哺乳動物に投与して増殖させ、その腹水として得る方法などが採用される。前者の方法は、高純度の抗体を得るのに適しており、一方、後者の方法は、抗体の大量生産に適している。\n\n\nIn order to obtain a monoclonal antibody from the hybridoma, the hybridoma is cultured according to a usual method and obtained as a culture supernatant thereof, or the hybridoma is administered to a mammal compatible therewith to proliferate, and its ascites The method obtained as follows is adopted. The former method is suitable for obtaining highly pure antibodies, while the latter method is suitable for mass production of antibodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　本発明には、モノクローナル抗体として、抗体遺伝子をハイブリドーマからクローニングし、適当なベクターに組み込んで、これを宿主に導入し、遺伝子組換え技術を用いて産生させた組換え型抗体を用いることができる（例えば、Borrebaeck C. A. K. and Larrick J. W. THERAPEUTIC MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, Published in the United Kingdom by MACMILLAN PUBLISHERS LTD, 1990参照）。\n\n　具体的には、目的とする抗体を産生する細胞、例えばハイブリドーマから、抗体の可変（V）領域をコードするmRNAを単離する。mRNAの単離は、公知の方法、例えば、グアニジン超遠心法（Chirgwin, J. M. et al., Biochemistry (1979) 18, 5294-5299 ）、AGPC法（Chomczynski, P. et al., Anal. Biochem. (1987)162, 156-159)等により全RNAを調製し、mRNA Purification Kit (GEヘルスケアバイオサイエンス製）等を使用してmRNAを調製する。また、QuickPrep mRNA Purification Kit（GEヘルスケアバイオサイエンス製）を用いることによりmRNAを直接調製することができる。\n\n　得られたmRNAから逆転写酵素を用いて抗体V領域のcDNAを合成する。cDNAの合成は、AMV Reverse Transcriptase First-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit等を用いて行うことができる。また、cDNAの合成および増幅を行うには5'-Ampli FINDER RACE Kit（Clontech製）およびPCRを用いた5'-RACE法（Frohman, M. A. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA(1988)85, 8998-9002；Belyavsky, A. et al., Nucleic Acids Res.(1989)17, 2919-2932）を使用することができる。得られたPCR産物から目的とするDNA断片を精製し、ベクターDNAと連結する。さらに、これより組換えベクターを作成し、大腸菌等に導入してコロニーを選択して所望の組換えベクターを調製する。目的とするDNAの塩基配列を公知の方法、例えば、デオキシ法により確認する。\n\n　目的とする抗体のV領域をコードするDNAが得られれば、これを所望の抗体定常領域（C領域）をコードするDNAと連結し、これを発現ベクターへ組み込む。または、抗体のV領域をコードするDNAを、抗体C領域のDNAを含む発現ベクターへ組み込んでもよい。\n\n　本発明で使用される抗体を製造するには、後述のように抗体遺伝子を発現制御領域、例えば、エンハンサー、プロモーターの制御のもとで発現するよう発現ベクターに組み込む。次に、この発現ベクターにより宿主細胞を形質転換し、抗体を発現させることができる。\n\nIn the present invention, as a monoclonal antibody, a recombinant antibody produced by cloning an antibody gene from a hybridoma, incorporating it into an appropriate vector, introducing it into a host, and producing it using a gene recombination technique can be used. (See, for example, Borrebaeck CAK and Larrick JW THERAPEUTIC MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, Published in the United Kingdom by MACMILLAN PUBLISHERS LTD, 1990). \n Specifically, mRNA encoding the variable (V) region of an antibody is isolated from a cell that produces the target antibody, for example, a hybridoma. Isolation of mRNA is performed by a known method such as guanidine ultracentrifugation (Chirgwin, JM et al., Biochemistry (1979) 18, 5294-5299), AGPC (Chomczynski, P. et al., Anal. Biochem. (1987) 162, 156-159) etc., and then prepare mRNA using mRNA Purification Kit (manufactured by GE Healthcare Bioscience).

Further, a recombinant vector is prepared from this, introduced into Escherichia coli, etc., and colonies are selected to prepare a desired recombinant vector. The base sequence of the target DNA is confirmed by a known method such as the deoxy method. \n If DNA encoding the V region of the target antibody is obtained, it is ligated with DNA encoding the desired antibody constant region (C region) and incorporated into an expression vector.

The amino acid residue to be mutated is preferably mutated to another amino acid in which the properties of the amino acid side chain are conserved. For example, amino acid side chain properties include hydrophobic amino acids (A, I, L, M, F, P, W, Y, V), hydrophilic amino acids (R, D, N, C, E, Q, G, H, K, S, T), amino acids having aliphatic side chains (G, A, V, L, I, P), amino acids having hydroxyl group-containing side chains (S, T, Y), sulfur atom-containing side chains Amino acids (C, M) having carboxylic acid and amide-containing side chains (D, N, E, Q), amino acids having base-containing side chains (R, K, H), aromatic-containing side chains The amino acids (H, F, Y, W) that can be used can be listed (the parentheses indicate the single letter of the amino acid).

However, as long as the obtained antibody has a function equivalent to the antibody of the present invention, it can be used as the antibody of the present invention. For example, when the antibody of the present invention is expressed in prokaryotic cells such as E. coli, a methionine residue is added to the N-terminus of the original antibody amino acid sequence.

Specifically, if DNA encoding a heavy chain variable region or a light chain variable region is obtained, it is ligated with DNA encoding a desired antibody constant region (C region) and incorporated into an expression vector. Alternatively, DNA encoding an antibody variable region may be incorporated into an expression vector containing antibody constant region DNA. It is incorporated into an expression vector so as to be expressed under the control of an expression control region such as an enhancer or promoter. Next, host cells can be transformed with this expression vector to express the antibody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　また、本発明では、ヒトに対する異種抗原性を低下させること等を目的として人為的に改変した遺伝子組換え型抗体、例えば、キメラ（chimeric）抗体、ヒト化（humanized）抗体などを使用できる。これらの改変抗体は、既知の方法を用いて製造することができる。キメラ抗体は、ヒト以外の哺乳動物、例えば、マウス抗体の重鎖、軽鎖の可変領域とヒト抗体の重鎖、軽鎖の定常領域からなる抗体であり、マウス抗体の可変領域をコードするDNAをヒト抗体の定常領域をコードするDNAと連結し、これを発現ベクターに組み込んで宿主に導入し産生させることにより得ることができる。\n\n\nIn the present invention, a genetically engineered antibody that has been artificially modified for the purpose of reducing the heterologous antigenicity to humans, such as a chimeric antibody or a humanized antibody, can be used. These modified antibodies can be produced using known methods. A chimeric antibody is a mammal other than a human, for example, a mouse antibody heavy chain, light chain variable region and a human antibody heavy chain, light chain constant region, and a DNA encoding the murine antibody variable region. Can be obtained by linking to a DNA encoding the constant region of a human antibody, incorporating it into an expression vector, introducing it into a host, and producing it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　キメラ抗体は、前記のようにして得た抗体V領域をコードするDNAをヒト抗体C領域をコードするDNAと連結し、これを発現ベクターに組み込んで宿主に導入し産生させることにより得られる（欧州特許出願公開番号EP 125023、国際特許出願公開番号WO 92-19759参照）。この既知の方法を用いて、本発明に有用なキメラ抗体を得ることができる。\n\n　ヒト化抗体は、再構成（reshaped）ヒト抗体とも称され、ヒト以外の哺乳動物、例えばマウス抗体の相補性決定領域（CDR; complementarity determining region）をヒト抗体の相補性決定領域へ移植したものであり、その一般的な遺伝子組換え手法も知られている。\n\nA chimeric antibody can be obtained by ligating the DNA encoding the antibody V region obtained as described above with DNA encoding the human antibody C region, incorporating it into an expression vector, introducing it into a host, and producing it (Europe). Patent Application Publication No. EP 125023, International Patent Application Publication No. WO 92-19759). Using this known method, a chimeric antibody useful in the present invention can be obtained. \n A humanized antibody is also called a reshaped human antibody, and is a non-human mammal, for example, a complementarity determining region (CDR) of a mouse antibody transplanted to the complementarity determining region of a human antibody. There are also known general genetic recombination techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　具体的には、マウス抗体のCDRとヒト抗体のフレームワーク領域（framework region；FR）を連結するように設計したDNA配列を、末端部にオーバーラップする部分を有するように作製した数個のオリゴヌクレオチドからPCR法により合成する。得られたDNAをヒト抗体定常領域をコードするDNAと連結し、次いで発現ベクターに組み込んで、これを宿主に導入し産生させることにより得られる（欧州特許出願公開番号EP 239400 、国際特許出願公開番号WO 96/02576参照）。\n\n\nSpecifically, several oligos were prepared so that the DNA sequence designed to link the CDR of the mouse antibody and the framework region (FR) of the human antibody had an overlapping portion at the end. It is synthesized from nucleotides by PCR. The obtained DNA is obtained by ligating with the DNA encoding the human antibody constant region, then incorporating it into an expression vector, introducing it into a host and producing it (European Patent Application Publication Number EP 239400, International Patent Application Publication Number). (See WO 96/02576).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　CDRを介して連結されるヒト抗体のFRは、相補性決定領域が良好な抗原結合部位を形成するものが選択される。必要に応じ、再構成ヒト抗体の相補性決定領域が適切な抗原結合部位を形成するように抗体の可変領域のフレームワーク領域のアミノ酸を置換してもよい（Sato, K.et al., Cancer Res. (1993) 53, 851-856）。\n\n\nThe FR of the human antibody to be linked via CDR is selected such that the complementarity determining region forms a favorable antigen binding site. If necessary, the amino acid in the framework region of the variable region of the antibody may be substituted so that the complementarity determining region of the reshaped human antibody forms an appropriate antigen-binding site (Sato, K.et al., Cancer Res. (1993) 53, 851-856).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　キメラ抗体、ヒト化抗体には、ヒト抗体C領域が使用される。ヒト抗体C領域としては、Cγが挙げられ、例えば、Cγ1、Cγ2、Cγ3またはCγ4を使用することができる。また、抗体またはその産生の安定性を改善するために、ヒト抗体C領域を修飾してもよい。\n\n\nThe human antibody C region is used for chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies. Examples of the human antibody C region include Cγ, and for example, Cγ1, Cγ2, Cγ3, or Cγ4 can be used. In addition, the human antibody C region may be modified in order to improve the stability of the antibody or its production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　キメラ抗体はヒト以外の哺乳動物由来抗体の可変領域とヒト抗体由来のC領域からなり、またヒト化抗体はヒト以外の哺乳動物由来抗体の相補性決定領域とヒト抗体由来のフレームワーク領域およびC領域からなり、両者はヒト体内における抗原性が低下しているため、本発明に使用される抗体として有用である。\n\n\nThe chimeric antibody is composed of a variable region of a non-human mammal-derived antibody and a C region derived from a human antibody, and the humanized antibody is a complementarity determining region of a non-human mammal-derived antibody, a framework region derived from a human antibody, and C Since both have a reduced antigenicity in the human body, they are useful as antibodies used in the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　また、ヒト抗体の取得方法も知られている。例えば、ヒトリンパ球をin vitroで所望の抗原または所望の抗原を発現する細胞で感作し、感作リンパ球をヒトミエローマ細胞、例えばU266と融合させ、抗原への結合活性を有する所望のヒト抗体を得ることもできる（特公平1-59878参照）。また、ヒト抗体遺伝子の全てのレパートリーを有するトランスジェニック動物を所望の抗原で免疫することで所望のヒト抗体を取得することができる（国際特許出願公開番号WO 93/12227, WO 92/03918，WO 94/02602, WO 94/25585，WO 96/34096, WO 96/33735参照）。さらに、ヒト抗体ライブラリーを用いて、パンニングによりヒト抗体を取得する技術も知られている。例えば、ヒト抗体の可変領域を一本鎖抗体（scFv）としてファージディスプレイ法によりファージの表面に発現させ、抗原に結合するファージを選択することができる。選択されたファージの遺伝子を解析すれば、抗原に結合するヒト抗体の可変領域をコードするDNA配列を決定することができる。抗原に結合するscFvのDNA配列が明らかになれば、当該配列を適当な発現ベクターを作製し、ヒト抗体を取得することができる。これらの方法は周知であり、WO 92/01047, WO 92/20791, WO 93/06213, WO 93/11236, WO 93/19172, WO 95/01438, WO 95/15388を参考にすることができる。\n\n\nIn addition, a method for obtaining a human antibody is also known. For example, human lymphocytes are sensitized with a desired antigen or cells expressing the desired antigen in vitro, and the sensitized lymphocytes are fused with human myeloma cells, such as U266, to have a desired human antibody having an antigen-binding activity. (See Japanese Patent Publication No. 1-59878). Further, a desired human antibody can be obtained by immunizing a transgenic animal having all repertoires of human antibody genes with a desired antigen (International Patent Application Publication Nos. WO 93/12227, WO 92/03918, WO 94/02602, WO 94/25585, WO 96/34096, WO 96/33735). Furthermore, a technique for obtaining a human antibody by panning using a human antibody library is also known. For example, the variable region of a human antibody is expressed as a single chain antibody (scFv) on the surface of the phage by the phage display method, and a phage that binds to the antigen can be selected. By analyzing the gene of the selected phage, the DNA sequence encoding the variable region of the human antibody that binds to the antigen can be determined. If the DNA sequence of scFv that binds to the antigen is clarified, an appropriate expression vector can be prepared from the sequence to obtain a human antibody. These methods are well known and can be referred to WO 92/01047, WO 92/20791, WO 93/06213, WO 93/11236, WO 93/19172, WO 95/01438, and WO 95/15388.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　前記のように構築した抗体遺伝子は、公知の方法により発現させることができる。哺乳類細胞を用いた場合、常用される有用なプロモーター、発現される抗体遺伝子、その3'側下流にポリAシグナルを機能的に結合させたDNAあるいはそれを含むベクターにより発現させることができる。例えばプロモーター／エンハンサーとしては、ヒトサイトメガロウィルス前期プロモーター／エンハンサー（human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter/enhancer）を挙げることができる。\n\n　また、その他に本発明で使用される抗体発現に使用できるプロモーター／エンハンサーとして、レトロウィルス、ポリオーマウィルス、アデノウィルス、シミアンウィルス40（SV40)等のウィルスプロモーター／エンハンサーやヒトエロンゲーションファクター1α（HEF1α）などの哺乳類細胞由来のプロモーター／エンハンサーを用いればよい。\n\n　例えば、SV40プロモーター／エンハンサーを使用する場合、Mulliganらの方法（Mulligan, R. C. et al., Nature (1979) 277, 108-114) 、また、HEF1αプロモーター／エンハンサーを使用する場合、Mizushimaらの方法（Mizushima, S. and Nagata, S. Nucleic Acids Res. (1990) 18, 5322 ）に従えば容易に実施することができる。\n\nThe antibody gene constructed as described above can be expressed by a known method.

For example, examples of the promoter include lacZ promoter and araB promoter. When using the lacZ promoter, the method of Ward et al. (Ward, ES et al., Nature (1989) 341, 544-546; Ward, ES et al. FASEB J. (1992) 6, 2422-2427), araB promoter Can be used according to the method of Better et al. (Better, M. et al. Science (1988) 240, 1041-1043). \n As a signal sequence for antibody secretion, a pelB signal sequence (Lei, S. P. et al J. Bacteriol. (1987) 169, 4379-4383) may be used in the case of production in the periplasm of E. coli. After separating the antibody produced in the periplasm, the structure of the antibody is appropriately refolded and used (see, for example, WO96 / 30394).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　複製起源としては、SV40、ポリオーマウィルス、アデノウィルス、ウシパピローマウィルス（BPV)等の由来のものを用いることができ、さらに、宿主細胞系で遺伝子コピー数増幅のため、発現ベクターは選択マーカーとして、アミノグリコシドホスホトランスフェラーゼ（APH）遺伝子、チミジンキナーゼ（TK）遺伝子、大腸菌キサンチングアニンホスホリボシルトランスフェラーゼ（Ecogpt）遺伝子、ジヒドロ葉酸還元酵素（dhfr）遺伝子等を含むことができる。\n\n\nAs the origin of replication, those derived from SV40, polyoma virus, adenovirus, bovine papilloma virus (BPV), etc. can be used.

Production systems for antibody production include in vitro and in vivo production systems. Examples of in vitro production systems include production systems that use eukaryotic cells and production systems that use prokaryotic cells. \n When eukaryotic cells are used, there are production systems using animal cells, plant cells, or fungal cells. Animal cells include (1) mammalian cells such as CHO, COS, myeloma, BHK (baby hamster kidney), HeLa, Vero, etc., (2) amphibian cells such as Xenopus oocytes, or (3) insects Cells such as sf9, sf21, Tn5, etc. are known. As plant cells, cells derived from Nicotiana tabacum are known, and these may be cultured in callus. As fungal cells, yeasts such as the genus Saccharomyces, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and filamentous fungi such as the genus Aspergillus, such as Aspergillus niger, are known. \n When prokaryotic cells are used, there are production systems using bacterial cells. Known bacterial cells include E. coli and Bacillus subtilis. \n An antibody can be obtained by introducing a desired antibody gene into these cells by transformation and culturing the transformed cells in vitro. Culture is performed according to a known method. For example, DMEM, MEM, RPMI1640, and IMDM can be used as the culture medium, and serum supplements such as fetal calf serum (FCS) can be used in combination. Alternatively, antibodies may be produced in vivo by transferring cells into which the antibody gene has been introduced to the peritoneal cavity of animals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　一方、in vivoの産生系としては、動物を使用する産生系や植物を使用する産生系が挙げられる。動物を使用する場合、哺乳類動物、昆虫を用いる産生系などがある。\n\n　哺乳類動物としては、ヤギ、ブタ、ヒツジ、マウス、ウシなどを用いることができる（Vicki Glaser, SPECTRUM Biotechnology Applications, 1993)。また、昆虫としては、カイコを用いることができる。植物を使用する場合、例えばタバコを用いることができる。\n\n　これらの動物または植物に抗体遺伝子を導入し、動物または植物の体内で抗体を産生させ、回収する。例えば、抗体遺伝子をヤギβカゼインのような乳汁中に固有に産生される蛋白質をコードする遺伝子の途中に挿入して融合遺伝子として調製する。抗体遺伝子が挿入された融合遺伝子を含むDNA断片をヤギの胚へ注入し、この胚を雌のヤギへ導入する。胚を受容したヤギから生まれるトランスジェニックヤギまたはその子孫が産生する乳汁から所望の抗体を得る。トランスジェニックヤギから産生される所望の抗体を含む乳汁量を増加させるために、適宜ホルモンをトランスジェニックヤギに使用してもよい（Ebert, K.M. et al., Bio/Technology (1994) 12, 699-702 ）。\n\n　また、カイコを用いる場合、目的の抗体遺伝子を挿入したバキュロウィルスをカイコに感染させ、このカイコの体液より所望の抗体を得る（Maeda, S. et al., Nature (1985) 315, 592-594）。さらに、タバコを用いる場合、目的の抗体遺伝子を植物発現用ベクター、例えばpMON530に挿入し、このベクターをAgrobacterium tumefaciensのようなバクテリアに導入する。このバクテリアをタバコ、例えばNicotiana tabacumに感染させ、本タバコの葉より所望の抗体を得る（Julian, K.-C. Ma et al., Eur. J. Immunol.(1994)24, 131-138）。\n\nOn the other hand, examples of in vivo production systems include production systems using animals and production systems using plants. When animals are used, there are production systems using mammals and insects. \n As mammals, goats, pigs, sheep, mice, cows and the like can be used (Vicki Glaser, SPECTRUM Biotechnology Applications, 1993). In addition, silkworms can be used as insects. When using a plant, for example, tobacco can be used. \n An antibody gene is introduced into these animals or plants, and the antibodies are produced and collected in the animals or plants. For example, an antibody gene is inserted into the middle of a gene encoding a protein inherently produced in milk such as goat β casein to prepare a fusion gene. A DNA fragment containing a fusion gene into which an antibody gene has been inserted is injected into a goat embryo, and the embryo is introduced into a female goat. The desired antibody is obtained from the milk produced by the transgenic goat born from the goat that received the embryo or its offspring. Hormones may be used in transgenic goats as appropriate to increase the amount of milk containing the desired antibody produced from the transgenic goat (Ebert, KM et al., Bio / Technology (1994) 12, 699- 702). \n When silkworms are used, silkworms are infected with baculovirus into which the antibody gene of interest is inserted, and desired antibodies are obtained from the body fluids of these silkworms (Maeda, S. et al., Nature (1985) 315, 592-594). ). Further, when tobacco is used, the target antibody gene is inserted into a plant expression vector such as pMON530, and this vector is introduced into a bacterium such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens. This bacterium is infected with tobacco, for example, Nicotiana tabacum, and the desired antibody is obtained from the leaves of this tobacco (Julian, K.-C. Ma et al., Eur. J. Immunol. (1994) 24, 131-138). .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　上述のようにin vitroまたはin vivoの産生系にて抗体を産生する場合、抗体重鎖（H鎖）または軽鎖（L鎖）をコードするDNAを別々に発現ベクターに組み込んで宿主を同時に形質転換させてもよいし、あるいはH鎖およびL鎖をコードするDNAを単一の発現ベクターに組み込んで、宿主を形質転換させてもよい（国際特許出願公開番号WO 94-11523参照）。\n\n\nWhen producing antibodies in the in vitro or in vivo production system as described above, DNA encoding the antibody heavy chain (H chain) or light chain (L chain) is separately incorporated into an expression vector and simultaneously transformed into the host. Alternatively, the host may be transformed by incorporating DNAs encoding the H and L chains into a single expression vector (see International Patent Application Publication No. WO 94-11523).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　本発明で使用される抗体は、低分子化抗体であってもよい。本発明において低分子化抗体(minibody)とは、全長抗体(whole antibody、例えばwhole IgG等)を親抗体とし、全長抗体の一部分が欠損している抗体断片を含み、抗原への結合能を有していれば特に限定されない。本発明の抗体断片は、全長抗体の一部分であれば特に限定されないが、重鎖可変領域（VH）または軽鎖可変領域（VL）を含んでいることが好ましく、特に好ましいのはVHとVLの両方を含む断片である。抗体断片の具体例としては、例えば、Fab、Fab'、F(ab')2、Fv、scFv（シングルチェインFv）、sc（Fv\n２\n）などを挙げることができるが、好ましくはdiabody (Huston, J. S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (1988) 85, 5879-5883、 Plickthun「The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies」Vol.113, Resenburg および Moore編, Springer Verlag, New York, pp.269-315, (1994))である。このような抗体断片を得るには、抗体を酵素、例えば、パパイン、ペプシンなどで処理し抗体断片を生成させるか、または、これら抗体断片をコードする遺伝子を構築し、これを発現ベクターに導入した後、適当な宿主細胞で発現させればよい（例えば、Co, M. S. et al., J. Immunol. (1994) 152, 2968-2976 ; Better, M. and Horwitz, A. H., Methods Enzymol. (1989) 178, 476-496 ; Pluckthun, A. and Skerra, A., Methods Enzymol. (1989) 178, 497-515 ; Lamoyi, E., Methods Enzymol. (1986) 121, 652-663 ; Rousseaux, J. et al., Methods Enzymol. (1986) 121, 663-669 ; Bird, R. E. and Walker, B. W., Trends Biotechnol. (1991) 9, 132-137参照）。\n\n　本発明における低分子化抗体は、全長抗体よりも分子量が小さくなることが好ましいが、例えば、ダイマー、トリマー、テトラマーなどの多量体を形成すること等もあり、全長抗体よりも分子量が大きくなることもある。\n\nThe antibody used in the present invention may be a low molecular weight antibody. In the present invention, a low molecular weight antibody (minibody) includes a full-length antibody (whole antibody such as whole IgG) as a parent antibody and includes an antibody fragment in which a part of the full-length antibody is deleted, and has an ability to bind to an antigen. If it does, it will not specifically limit. The antibody fragment of the present invention is not particularly limited as long as it is a part of a full-length antibody, but preferably contains a heavy chain variable region (VH) or a light chain variable region (VL), particularly preferably VH and VL. A fragment containing both. Specific examples of antibody fragments include, for example, Fab, Fab ′, F (ab ′) 2, Fv, scFv (single chain Fv), sc (Fv \n2\n ), and preferably diabody (Huston, JS et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1988) 85, 5879-5883, Plickthun “The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies” Vol. 113, Resenburg and Moore, Springer Verlag, New York, pp. 269- 315, (1994)). In order to obtain such antibody fragments, the antibody is treated with an enzyme such as papain or pepsin to generate antibody fragments, or genes encoding these antibody fragments are constructed and introduced into expression vectors. Thereafter, it may be expressed in an appropriate host cell (for example, Co, MS et al., J. Immunol. (1994) 152, 2968-2976; Better, M. and Horwitz, AH, Methods Enzymol. (1989) 178, 476-496; Pluckthun, A. and Skerra, A., Methods Enzymol. (1989) 178, 497-515; Lamoyi, E., Methods Enzymol. (1986) 121, 652-663; Rousseaux, J. et al., Methods Enzymol. (1986) 121, 663-669; Bird, RE and Walker, BW, Trends Biotechnol. (1991) 9, 132-137). \n The low molecular weight antibody in the present invention preferably has a smaller molecular weight than the full-length antibody. However, for example, it may form a multimer such as a dimer, trimer or tetramer, and the molecular weight is larger than that of the full-length antibody. There is also.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　本発明において好ましい低分子化抗体は、抗体のVHを２つ以上およびVLを２つ以上含み、これら各可変領域を直接あるいはリンカー等を介して間接的に結合した抗体である。結合は、共有結合でも非共有結合でもよく、また、共有結合と非共有結合の両方でよい。さらに好ましい低分子化抗体は、VHとVLが非共有結合により結合して形成されるVH-VL対を２つ以上含んでいる抗体である。この場合、低分子化抗体中の一方のVH-VL対と他方のVH-VL対との間の距離が、全長抗体における距離よりも短くなる抗体が好ましい。\n\n\nA preferred low molecular weight antibody in the present invention is an antibody comprising two or more VHs and two or more VLs of an antibody, and these variable regions are bound directly or indirectly through a linker or the like. The bond may be covalent or non-covalent, and may be both covalent and non-covalent. Further preferred low molecular weight antibodies are antibodies comprising two or more VH-VL pairs formed by binding VH and VL by non-covalent bonds. In this case, an antibody in which the distance between one VH-VL pair and the other VH-VL pair in the low molecular weight antibody is shorter than the distance in the full-length antibody is preferable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　本発明においてscFvは、抗体のH鎖V領域とL鎖V領域を連結することにより得られる。このscFvにおいて、H鎖V領域とL鎖V領域はリンカー、好ましくは、ペプチドリンカーを介して連結される（Huston, J. S. et al.、Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (1988) 85, 5879-5883）。scFvにおけるH鎖V領域およびL鎖V領域は、上記抗体として記載されたもののいずれの由来であってもよい。V領域を連結するペプチドリンカーとしては、例えばアミノ酸12-19残基からなる任意の一本鎖ペプチドが用いられる。\n\n　scFvをコードするDNAは、前記抗体のH鎖または、H鎖V領域をコードするDNA、およびL鎖または、L鎖V領域をコードするDNAを鋳型とし、それらの配列のうちの所望のアミノ酸配列をコードするDNA部分を、その両端を規定するプライマー対を用いてPCR法により増幅し、次いで、さらにペプチドリンカー部分をコードするDNAおよびその両端を各々H鎖、L鎖と連結されるように規定するプライマー対を組み合せて増幅することにより得られる。\n\nIn the present invention, scFv is obtained by linking an H chain V region and an L chain V region of an antibody. In this scFv, the H chain V region and the L chain V region are linked via a linker, preferably a peptide linker (Huston, JS et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1988) 85, 5879. -5883). The H chain V region and the L chain V region in scFv may be derived from any of those described as the above antibody. As the peptide linker that links the V regions, for example, any single chain peptide consisting of amino acid residues 12-19 is used. \n The DNA encoding scFv is a DNA sequence encoding the H chain or H chain V region of the antibody, and a DNA encoding the L chain or L chain V region, and a desired amino acid sequence of those sequences. A DNA portion encoding the DNA is amplified by PCR using a primer pair that defines both ends thereof, and then further specified so that the DNA encoding the peptide linker portion and both ends thereof are linked to the H chain and L chain, respectively. Obtained by combining and amplifying primer pairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　また、一旦scFvをコードするDNAが作製されれば、それらを含有する発現ベクター、および該発現ベクターにより形質転換された宿主を常法に従って得ることができ、また、その宿主を用いて常法に従って、scFvを得ることができる。\n\n\nMoreover, once a DNA encoding scFv is prepared, an expression vector containing them and a host transformed with the expression vector can be obtained according to a conventional method, and the host can be used according to a conventional method. , ScFv can be obtained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　これら抗体の断片は、前記と同様にしてその遺伝子を取得し発現させ、宿主により産生させることができる。本発明でいう「抗体」にはこれらの抗体の断片も包含される。\n\n　本発明において特に好ましい低分子化抗体はdiabodyである。diabodyは、可変領域と可変領域をリンカー等で結合したフラグメント（例えば、scFv等）（以下、diabodyを構成するフラグメント）を２つ結合させて二量体化させたものであり、通常、２つのVLと２つのVHを含む(P.Holliger et al., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA, 90, 6444-6448 (1993)、EP404097号、WO93/11161号、Johnson et al., Method in Enzymology, 203, 88-98, (1991)、Holliger et al., Protein Engineering, 9, 299-305, (1996)、Perisic et al., Structure, 2, 1217-1226, (1994)、John et al., Protein Engineering, 12(7), 597-604, (1999)、Holliger et al,. Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA., 90, 6444-6448, (1993)、Atwell et al., Mol.Immunol. 33, 1301-1312, (1996))。diabodyを構成するフラグメント間の結合は非共有結合でも、共有結合でよいが、好ましくは非共有結合である。\n\nThese antibody fragments can be produced by the host by obtaining and expressing the gene in the same manner as described above. The term “antibody” as used in the present invention encompasses these antibody fragments. \n A particularly preferred low molecular weight antibody in the present invention is diabody. A diabody is a dimerization by linking two fragments (for example, scFv, etc.) obtained by connecting a variable region and a variable region with a linker or the like (hereinafter, fragments comprising diabody). Containing VL and two VHs (P. Holliger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90, 6444-6448 (1993), EP404097, WO93 / 11161, Johnson et al., Method in Enzymology , 203, 88-98, (1991), Holliger et al., Protein Engineering, 9, 299-305, (1996), Pericic et al., Structure, 2, 1217-1226, (1994), John et al. , Protein Engineering, 12 (7), 597-604, (1999), Holliger et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 90, 6444-6448, (1993), Atwell et al., Mol. Immunol. 33, 1301-1312, (1996)). The bond between the fragments constituting the diabody may be a non-covalent bond or a covalent bond, but is preferably a non-covalent bond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　また、diabodyを構成するフラグメント同士をリンカーなどで結合して、一本鎖diabody（sc diabody）とすることも可能である。その際、diabodyを構成するフラグメント同士を20アミノ酸程度の長いリンカーを用いて結合すると、同一鎖上に存在するdiabodyを構成するフラグメント同士で非共有結合が可能となり、二量体を形成する。\n\n　diabodyを構成するフラグメントは、VLとVHを結合したもの、VLとVLを結合したもの、VHとVHを結合したもの等を挙げることができるが、好ましくはVHとVLを結合したものである。diabodyを構成するフラグメント中において、可変領域と可変領域を結合するリンカーは特に制限されないが、同一フラグメント中の可変領域の間で非共有結合がおこらない程度に短いリンカーを用いることが好ましい。そのようなリンカーの長さは当業者が適宜決定することができるが、通常2～14アミノ酸、好ましくは3～9アミノ酸、特に好ましくは4～6アミノ酸である。この場合、同一フラグメント上にコードされるVLとVHとは、その間のリンカーが短いため、同一鎖上のVLとVHの間で非共有結合がおこらず、単鎖V領域フラグメントが形成されないため、他のフラグメントとの非共有結合による二量体を形成する。さらに、diabody作製と同じ原理で、diabodyを構成するフラグメントを３つ以上結合させて、トリマー、テトラマーなどの多量体化させた抗体を作製することも可能である。diabodyの例としては、上述のC3B3 diabody（WO2008/007755）や、2D7 diabody（Kimura, et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun., 325: 1201-1209 (2004)）等が挙げられるが、これらに限定されない。\n\nIn addition, fragments constituting diabody can be combined with a linker or the like to form a single-chain diabody (sc diabody). At that time, if the fragments constituting the diabody are joined together using a linker having a length of about 20 amino acids, the fragments constituting the diabody existing on the same chain can be non-covalently bound to form a dimer. \n Examples of the fragment constituting the diabody include a combination of VL and VH, a combination of VL and VL, a combination of VH and VH, and the like, and preferably a combination of VH and VL. In the fragment constituting the diabody, the linker that connects the variable region and the variable region is not particularly limited, but it is preferable to use a linker that is short enough so that non-covalent bonding does not occur between the variable regions in the same fragment. The length of such a linker can be appropriately determined by those skilled in the art, but is usually 2 to 14 amino acids, preferably 3 to 9 amino acids, particularly preferably 4 to 6 amino acids. In this case, VL and VH encoded on the same fragment have a short linker, so non-covalent bonding does not occur between VL and VH on the same chain, and no single-chain V region fragment is formed. Forms non-covalent dimers with other fragments. Furthermore, it is also possible to produce a multimerized antibody such as a trimer or tetramer by combining three or more fragments constituting diabody on the same principle as that for producing diabody. Examples of diabody include the above-mentioned C3B3 diabody (WO2008 / 007755), 2D7 diabody (Kimura, et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun., 325: 1201-1209 (2004)), and the like.

As shown in the following examples, anti-HLA class I antibody was found to be effective for SP cells, which are a kind of hematological cancer stem cell in the present invention. It is considered effective. \n \n1. SP fraction in MM cell line\n \n The myeloma cell lines RPMI 8226 (Health Science Resources Bank, Osaka, Japan), U266 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), MM.1S (provided by Dr. Steven Rosen, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) Dispense into tubes (1 × 10 \n6\n ), remove supernatant after centrifugation, PBS / 3 containing Hoechst33342 (final 5 μg / mL, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and PI (final 1 μg / mL, Sigma) 3 mL each of% FBS was added and cultured at 37 ° C. for 90 minutes. In addition, 100 μM verapamil (Sigma) was added as negative control of SP fraction. Centrifugation and washing were repeated three times, suspended in 1 mL of PBS / 3% FBS, and analyzed by FACS (Coultar). \n In \nRPMI\n 8226 and U266 cells, the presence of SP fraction suppressed by the addition of verapamil was confirmed (0.2% and 0.08%, respectively, Fig. 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n２．Expression of cell surface antigens\n \n\n　RPMI 8226細胞を用い、SP fractionとNon-SP fractionをソーティングした。細胞表面マーカーに対する蛍光標識モノクローナル抗体（P-glycoprotein抗体，Coulter #IM2370；ABCG2抗体，Chemicon #MAB4146；VLA-4抗体，Pharmingen #31475；CD138抗体，Immunotech #IM2759；HLA-A, C3B3 IgG抗体）で染色し、FACSにて解析した（図２。グレーはnegative control抗体）。薬剤耐性に関与するp-glycoproteinはいずれの細胞も発現していなかったが、ABCG2はSP fractionの一部の細胞に高発現していた。骨髄腫細胞の間質細胞との接着に関与するVLA-4については両者に差はなかったが、分化抗原であるCD138はSP fractionが低発現であった。なお、HLA-Aについてはいずれの細胞も高発現しており、これらの細胞はC3B3-DBの治療標的となりうる可能性が示唆された。\n\n \n2. Expression of cell surface antigens\n \n \nRPMI\n 8226 cells were used to sort SP fraction and Non-SP fraction. Fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody against cell surface marker (P-glycoprotein antibody, Coulter # IM2370; ABCG2 antibody, Chemicon # MAB4146; VLA-4 antibody, Pharmingen # 31475; CD138 antibody, Immunotech # IM2759; HLA-A, C3B3 IgG antibody) Stained and analyzed by FACS (FIG. 2. Gray is negative control antibody). None of the cells expressed p-glycoprotein involved in drug resistance, but ABCG2 was highly expressed in some cells of the SP fraction. There was no difference between VLA-4, which is involved in adhesion to stromal cells of myeloma cells, but CD138, a differentiation antigen, had a low expression of SP fraction. HLA-A was highly expressed in all cells, suggesting that these cells may be a therapeutic target for C3B3-DB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n３．Expression of ABCG2 protein\n \n\n　薬剤耐性に関与するABC transporterの１種であるABCG2の発現についてサイトスピン標本をABCG2抗体とFITC標識２次抗体（Zymed, San Francisco, CA）にて染色し、共焦点レーザー顕微鏡（Nikon, Tokyo, Japan）にて観察した。RPMI 8226のSP fractionはnon-SP fractionと比較し、ABCG2を細胞表面に高発現していた（図３）。\n\n \n3. Expression of ABCG2 protein\n \n Expression of ABCG2, one of the ABC transporters involved in drug resistance, cytospin specimens were stained with ABCG2 antibody and FITC-labeled secondary antibody (Zymed, San Francisco, CA), and confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The SP fraction of \nRPMI\n 8226 was highly expressed on the cell surface compared to the non-SP fraction (FIG. 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n４．Growth curves\n \n\n　ソーティングしたSP fractionとnon-SP fractionを培養し、それぞれの細胞数を経時的に測定した（図４）。SP fractionはnon-SP fractionよりも増殖速度が遅いことが明らかとなった。\n\n　以上のことから、SP fractionはABCG2を高発現し薬剤耐性でdormantなcancer stem cellに類似した特徴を有していることが明らかとなった。このSP fractionは化学療法後も残存し、再発をきたすと考えられることから、SP fractionに対するC3B3-DBの効果を検討した。\n\n \n4). Growth curves\n \n The sorted SP fraction and non-SP fraction were cultured, and the number of each cell was measured over time (FIG. 4). It was revealed that the SP fraction had a slower growth rate than the non-SP fraction. \n From the above, it was clarified that the SP fraction has characteristics similar to dormant cancer stem cells that highly express ABCG2 and are drug resistant. Since this SP fraction remains after chemotherapy and is thought to cause recurrence, the effect of C3B3-DB on SP fraction was examined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n５．Effect of C3B3 diabody on SP cell fraction\n \n\n　RPMI 8226細胞をC3B3-DB (1 μg/ml)やmelphalan (10 μM; Sigma)の存在下で48時間培養した後、SP fractionの割合をフローサイトメトリーで測定した（図５）。コントロールと比較し、C3B3-DBで処理した細胞はSP fractionが0.3%と減少し、non-SP fractionも4.0%と減少した。一方、melphalanで処理した細胞はnon-SP fractionが3.9%と減少したものの、SP fractionは0.7%と変わらなかった。このことから、SP fractionは抗癌剤に抵抗性であるがC3B3-DBには感受性があることが示唆された。\n\n \n5). Effect of C3B3 diabody on SP cell fraction\n \n \nRPMI\n 8226 cells were cultured for 48 hours in the presence of C3B3-DB (1 μg / ml) and melphalan (10 μM; Sigma), and then the SP fraction ratio was measured by flow cytometry (FIG. 5). Compared with the control, cells treated with C3B3-DB had a SP fraction decreased to 0.3% and a non-SP fraction also decreased to 4.0%. On the other hand, cells treated with melphalan had a non-SP fraction decreased to 3.9%, but the SP fraction remained unchanged at 0.7%. This suggests that SP fraction is resistant to anticancer drugs but sensitive to C3B3-DB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n６．Effect of C3B3 diabody on SP cell fraction\n \n\n　骨髄腫患者の骨髄よりhuman multiple myeloma cell enrichment cocktail (StemCell technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada)を用いて骨髄腫細胞を純化し、同様の検討を行ったところ、melphalanではnon-SP fractionのみが傷害されたが、C3B3-DBではSP fractionとnon-SP fractionの両者が傷害された（図６）。\n\n \n6). Effect of C3B3 diabody on SP cell fraction\n \n A myeloma cell was purified from the bone marrow of a myeloma patient using human multiple myeloma cell enrichment cocktail (StemCell technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada), and the same study was performed.In melphalan, only non-SP fraction was damaged. However, both SP fraction and non-SP fraction were damaged in C3B3-DB (FIG. 6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n７．Apoptosis assay\n \n\n　RPMI 8226をSP fractionとnon-SP fractionにソーティングし、各々をC3B3-DB (1 μg/ml)やbortezomib (5, 10, 20 nM; (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA)）、melphalan (5, 10, 20 μM)の存在下に48時間培養した。その後、Annexin V-PI染色(MBL, Nagoya, Japan)を行い、apoptosisの割合を測定し、コントロールを100%として生細胞率を示した（図７）。\n\n　bortezomibやmelphalanではSP fractionよりもnon-SP fractionの方が強く傷害されたが、C3B3-DBではSP fraction、non-SP fractionともに強い細胞障害が誘導された。\n\n \n7). Apoptosis assay\n \n \nRPMI\n 8226 is sorted into SP fraction and non-SP fraction, each of which is C3B3-DB (1 μg / ml), bortezomib (5, 10, 20 nM; (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA)), melphalan (5, 10 , 20 μM) for 48 hours. Subsequently, Annexin V-PI staining (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) was performed, the proportion of apoptosis was measured, and the viable cell rate was shown with the control as 100% (FIG. 7). \n In bortezomib and melphalan, non-SP fraction was more severely damaged than SP fraction, but in C3B3-DB, strong cell damage was induced in both SP fraction and non-SP fraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n８．Colony assay\n \n\n　RPMI 8226をSP fractionとnon-SP fractionにソーティングし、各々をC3B3-DB (1 μg/ml)存在下のもと、メチルセルロース培地（MethoCult, StemCell technologies）にて11日間培養した。50個以上の細胞からなる集団をコロニーとして、コロニー数を測定した（図８）。\n\n　SP fractionはnon-SP fractionよりも多くのコロニーを形成したが、C3B3-DBによりほぼ完全に抑制された。Non-SP fractionはコロニー形成が乏しかったが、同様にC3B3-DBによりコロニー形成はほぼ完全に抑制された。\n\n \n8). Colony assay\n \n \nRPMI\n 8226 was sorted into SP fraction and non-SP fraction, and each was cultured in methylcellulose medium (MethoCult, StemCell technologies) for 11 days in the presence of C3B3-DB (1 μg / ml). The number of colonies was measured using a population of 50 or more cells as a colony (FIG. 8). \n The SP fraction formed more colonies than the non-SP fraction, but was almost completely suppressed by C3B3-DB. The non-SP fraction was poor in colony formation, but the colony formation was similarly almost completely suppressed by C3B3-DB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n９．Effect of C3B3-DB on tumor growth in SCID mice\n \n\n　さらに、SCIDマウスを用いて腫瘍増殖の抑制効果を検討した。RPMI 8226のSP fraction (5x10\n6\n cells)をC3B3-DB (1μg/mL)で48時間処理し、4匹のSCIDマウスの右側胸部の皮下へ移植した。同時に未処理のSP fractionを左側に移植し、経時的に腫瘍の大きさを測定した。C3B3-DB未処理の細胞では、４週目より急速な腫瘍の増大を認めたが、C3B3-DB処理の細胞では、増殖速度は著明に抑制された（図９（ａ））。その後、それぞれの腫瘍を摘出し、SP細胞解析を行うと、C3B3-DB未処理の腫瘍ではSP fractionを0.33％認めたのに対し、C3B3-DB処理した腫瘍ではSP fractionは0.01%と著明に減少していた（図９（ｂ））。\n\n　さらに、腫瘍の増殖率を検討するために病理標本のKi-67染色を実施した。C3B3-DB未処理の腫瘍ではKi-67陽性細胞を多く認めたのに対し、C3B3-DB処理した腫瘍ではKi-67陽性細胞は減少していた（図９（ｃ））。\n\n　このことから，C3B3-DBはin vivoにおける腫瘍の増殖を抑制することが明らかとなった。\n\n \n9. Effect of C3B3-DB on tumor growth in SCID mice\n \n Furthermore, the suppression effect of tumor growth was examined using SCID mice. The SP fraction (5 × 10 \n6\n cells) of \nRPMI\n 8226 was treated with C3B3-DB (1 μg / mL) for 48 hours and transplanted subcutaneously into the right breast of 4 SCID mice. At the same time, an untreated SP fraction was implanted on the left side, and the tumor size was measured over time. In the cells not treated with C3B3-DB, rapid tumor growth was observed from the 4th week, but in the cells treated with C3B3-DB, the growth rate was markedly suppressed (FIG. 9 (a)). After that, when each tumor was removed and SP cell analysis was performed, SP fraction was 0.33% in tumors not treated with C3B3-DB, while SP fraction was significantly 0.01% in tumors treated with C3B3-DB. (FIG. 9B). \n Furthermore, Ki-67 staining of pathological specimens was performed to examine the growth rate of the tumor. In tumors not treated with C3B3-DB, many Ki-67 positive cells were observed, whereas in tumors treated with C3B3-DB, Ki-67 positive cells were decreased (FIG. 9 (c)). \n This indicates that C3B3-DB suppresses tumor growth in vivo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　このことから、melphalanやbortezomibは主に腫瘍細胞のnon-SP fractionを障害するが、C3B3-DBはnon-SPのみならずSP fractionに対しても細胞傷害を誘導することが明らかとなった。従って、従来の抗癌剤治療後に抗HLAクラスI抗体による治療を追加することは、残存する抗癌剤抵抗性のcancer stem cellを障害し、再発を抑制につながる維持療法として効果が期待できるものと考えられた。\n\n\nThis indicates that melphalan and bortezomib mainly impair the non-SP fraction of tumor cells, but C3B3-DB induces cytotoxicity not only against non-SP but also to SP fraction. Therefore, it was thought that adding anti-HLA class I antibody treatment after conventional anti-cancer drug treatment can be expected to be effective as a maintenance therapy that damages the remaining anti-cancer drug resistant cancer cells and suppresses recurrence. .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n　本発明により、骨髄腫等の癌の再発を予防するための維持療法用医薬組成物が提供された。血液癌や骨髄腫等の癌においては、化学療法により癌細胞が確認されなくなった場合であっても、一定期間経過後に癌が再発することがある。これは、化学療法により障害されなかった癌幹細胞が増殖するためと考えられる。癌の再発を抑制するために、癌細胞が確認されなくなった後も薬剤の投与を継続する維持療法が行われることがあるが、癌幹細胞に対しては従来の化学療法剤は効果が低いのが実情であった。一方本発明の組成物は、従来の化学療法剤によって障害することが困難な癌幹細胞に対して、障害作用を有する。従って、本発明の医薬組成物を従来の抗癌剤による治療後に投与することにより、残存する抗癌剤抵抗性の癌幹細胞を障害することが可能である。\n\n　このように本発明の医薬組成物は、抗癌剤のみでは完治の困難な腫瘍の治療や再発の防止に有用である。\n\nAccording to the present invention, a pharmaceutical composition for maintenance therapy for preventing recurrence of cancer such as myeloma is provided. In cancers such as blood cancer and myeloma, cancer may recur after a certain period of time even if cancer cells are no longer confirmed by chemotherapy. This is probably because cancer stem cells that were not damaged by chemotherapy proliferated. In order to suppress the recurrence of cancer, maintenance therapy that continues drug administration after cancer cells are no longer confirmed may be performed, but conventional chemotherapeutic agents are less effective against cancer stem cells Was the actual situation. On the other hand, the composition of the present invention has a damaging effect on cancer stem cells that are difficult to be damaged by conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, by administering the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention after treatment with a conventional anticancer agent, it is possible to damage the remaining anticancer drug-resistant cancer stem cells. \n Thus, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is useful for the treatment of tumors that are difficult to cure with anticancer agents alone and the prevention of recurrence."

New compounds having useful characteristics for photodynamic therapy for malignant tumors, preparation methods thereof, and photodynamic therapy of solid cancers containing the same as effective ingredients by effectively producing and having significantly superior tumor selectivity compared to conventional porphyrin-based photosensitizers. It relates to a pharmaceutical composition for the following.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n악성종양에 대한 광역학치료법(이하 PDT)은 현재 광범위하게 임상에 적용되고 있다. PDT의 효율성을 규정하는 중요한 요소 중의 하나는 표적성 또는 선택성(selectivity)으로서 종양조직과 정상조직에 있어 종양조직에만 광민감제를 선택적으로 축적시키는 정도를 나타낸다. 표적성이 높으면 PDT의 효과성이 높아져 치료시간을 단축시킬 수 있으며, 또한 체내에 주입된 약물의 부작용도 줄일 수 있게 된다. 특정 파장을 지닌 빛으로 광민감제를 활성화시키면 활성산소종의 일종인 일중항산소(singlet oxygen)와 라디칼 종(radical species)을 발생시키게 되는데, 이를 통해 직접적으로 종양세포를 죽이게 되며, 면역염증반응을 일으키고 또한 종양의 미소혈관계에 손상을 입히게 된다. 종래 광민감제들의 대부분이 종양에 일정 정도는 선택적으로 축적이 되었지만, 피부를 포함한 정상조직에도 축적이 된 것으로 나타났다.\nPhotodynamic therapy for malignant tumors (PDT) is now widely applied in the clinic. One of the important factors defining the efficiency of PDT is its target or selectivity, indicating the extent of selective accumulation of photosensitizers only in tumor tissues in tumor tissues and normal tissues. Higher targeting can increase the effectiveness of PDT, shorten the treatment time, and reduce the side effects of drugs injected into the body. Activating the photosensitizer with light with a specific wavelength generates singlet oxygen and radical species, which is a kind of reactive oxygen species, which directly kills tumor cells and triggers an immunoinflammatory reaction. And damage the tumor microvascular system. Although most of the conventional photosensitizers accumulate selectively to some extent in tumors, they accumulate in normal tissues including skin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n광민감제의 표적화 전달로 이러한 문제들을 해결할 수 있을 것이다. 이는 종양세포에 대한 선택적 축적정도를 개선시켜 광독성을 강화함으로써 가능할 수 있다. 표적화란 광활성화 물질을 종양추적(특정적)분자와 직접적으로 또는 캐리어를 이용해서 결합시키는 것을 의미한다. 이미 몇 가지 광민감제들이 종양-관련 항원(antigen)에 대한 항체와 결합된 바 있다. 저밀도 지단백(lipoprotein), 인슐린, 스테로이드, 트랜스페린, 상피세포성장인자(EGF)와 같은 리간드들 모두가, 이러한 리간드의 수용체를 과발현하는 세포로의 리간드-기반 광민감제의 표적화를 위하여 논의되어왔다. \nTargeted delivery of photosensitizers may solve these problems. This may be possible by enhancing phototoxicity by improving the degree of selective accumulation of tumor cells. Targeting means binding the photoactivating material directly to a tumor tracking (specific) molecule or using a carrier. Several photosensitizers have already been combined with antibodies to tumor-associated antigens. Ligands such as low density lipoproteins, insulin, steroids, transferrins, epidermal growth factor (EGF), all have been discussed for the targeting of ligand-based photosensitizers to cells that overexpress receptors of these ligands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n사실, 병변세포에서는 수용체 발현의 변화, 특정 세포표면막 지질과 단백질의 농도 증가 뿐만 아니라 세포적 미세환경(cellular microenvironment)의 변화 등이 모두 일어난다.\nIn fact, in lesion cells, changes in receptor expression, increased concentrations of specific cell surface lipids and proteins, as well as changes in cellular microenvironment occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n수용체 매개전달(receptor mediated delivery)을 이용한 여러 전달전략 중에서, 하기와 같은 이유로 엽산수용체 또한 종양특이적 약물 전달을 위한 유용한 타겟이 된다.\nAmong several delivery strategies using receptor mediated delivery, folic acid receptors are also useful targets for tumor specific drug delivery for the following reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n첫째, 엽산수용체들은 난소 암, 결장, 유선(mamma gland), 폐, 신장-세포성 암, 상피 종양의 뇌로의 전이 및 신경 내분비 암에서 종양세포 상에서 발현된다.\nFirst, folic acid receptors are expressed on tumor cells in ovarian cancer, colon, mamma gland, lung, kidney-cell cancer, epithelial tumor metastasis to the brain and neuroendocrine cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n둘째, 정상 조직에서 엽산 수용체의 발현은 상피세포의 apical_membrane 상의 위치로 인해 발현이 심각하게 제한되어있어 정상조식에서의 엽산 수용체에 대한 접근은 거의 일어나지 않는다. \nSecond, the expression of folic acid receptors in normal tissues is severely restricted due to the position of apical_membrane on epithelial cells, so that access to folic acid receptors in normal breakfast rarely occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n셋째, 극성화된 상피세포; 엽산수용체의 밀도가 증가한다(극성화된 상피세포 : 암이 악화된 정도에 따른 엽산수용체의 밀도 증가).\nThird, polarized epithelial cells; Increased folic acid receptor density (polarized epithelial cells: increased density of folic acid receptors depending on the extent of cancer exacerbation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n넷째, 엽산이 그것의 세포표면상 수용체와 높은 친화성을 나타낸다. 엽산과 거대분자의 결합은 거의 모든 테스트된 상태에서 시험관 내 엽산수용체-발현 암세포로의 이들의 전달을 개선시킬 수 있다.\nFourth, folic acid shows high affinity with its cell surface receptors. The binding of folic acid and macromolecules can improve their delivery to folate receptor-expressing cancer cells in vitro in almost all tested conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n엽산수용체(RFA)는 엽산과 결합하여 수용체-매개의 엔도시토시스를 통해 세포 내부로 이를 흡수하는, 수반성(adjoint) 글리코실 포스파티딜 이노시톨 당단백질이다.\nFolic acid receptor (RFA) is an adjoint glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol glycoprotein that binds folate and absorbs it into cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n비록 엽산수용체에 의한 세포 내로의 엽산 전달에 대한 정확한 작용기전이 확립되어 있지는 않지만, 엽산결합물들이 수용체-매개의 엔도시토시스를 통해 포유류 세포에 파괴되지 않은 채 축적된다는 것은 분명하다.\nAlthough no precise mechanism of action for folate delivery into cells by folate receptors is established, it is clear that folates accumulate in mammalian cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n생리적인 엽산은 특수화된 엔도시토시스 매개 경로를 통해 원형질막을 통과해서 세포질 안으로 이동한다. 암 세포 표면상의 엽산수용체와 결합한 후, 크기에 관계 없이 엽산결합물들은 엔도솜이라 불리는 세포내 성분으로 흡수되는 것으로 보여진다.\nPhysiological folic acid travels through the plasma membrane through specialized endocytosis mediated pathways and into the cytoplasm. After binding to folate receptors on the surface of cancer cells, folate bonds, regardless of size, have been shown to be absorbed into intracellular components called endosomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n일반적으로 이러한 선택성 또는 표적성의 정도는 10:1(암세포:정상세포)의 비율을 넘지 못하고 있다. 이에 항체, 올리고당, 트랜스페린, 호르몬 유사체 등과 같은 세포 표면에 특징적인 벡터 리간드와의 결합을 통해 특정 세포군의 막 수용체에 광민감제를 선택적으로 전달하는 방법이 개발되고 있다. 많은 연구결과들이 화학요법에 쓰이는 약물이 이러한 벡터와 결합되면 그렇지 않은 경우보다 변형된 세포에 5-10배 정도 더 많이 운반되고 있음을 보여주고 있다. 그 세포들은 파괴됨이 없이 수용체-매개 엔도시토시스를 통해서 결합물을 바인드할 수 있다.\nGenerally, the degree of selectivity or target does not exceed the ratio of 10: 1 (cancer cells: normal cells). Accordingly, a method of selectively delivering a photosensitive agent to membrane receptors of a specific cell population has been developed through binding with a vector ligand characteristic to a cell surface such as antibodies, oligosaccharides, transferrins, hormone analogs, and the like. Many studies have shown that drugs used in chemotherapy, when combined with these vectors, are transported five to ten times more in modified cells than otherwise. The cells can bind the binding through receptor-mediated endocytosis without disruption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n엽산은 세 개의 구성부분으로 이루어져 있으며, 비타민그룹에 속한다.\nFolic acid consists of three components and belongs to the vitamin group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n살아있는 유기물은 주로 dihydrofolic acid, tetrahydrofolic acid, 5-metil-tetrahydrofolic acid와 같은 엽산형태로 환원하는데, 이들은 단일 탄소 단편 운반 반응을 촉매하는 효소의 보조인자(cofactor)이다. 엽산의존적 효소들은 퓨린과 피리미딘 뉴클레오티드의 생합성과, 메티오닌, 히스티딘, 세린 및 글리신의 아미노산의 대사에 참여한다. 이 때문에 엽산은 세포분열과 성장에 반드시 필요한 성분이다.\nLiving organic matter is mainly reduced to folates such as dihydrofolic acid, tetrahydrofolic acid and 5-metil-tetrahydrofolic acid, which are cofactors of enzymes that catalyze the transport of single carbon fragments. Folic acid-dependent enzymes participate in the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides and the metabolism of amino acids of methionine, histidine, serine and glycine. Because of this, folic acid is an essential ingredient for cell division and growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n엽산은 생체 내에 들어간 후에 혈액에 흡수되며 플라즈마와 적혈구와 함께 조직으로 운반된다.\nFolic acid is absorbed into the blood after it enters the living body and is transported to the tissue along with plasma and red blood cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n동물세포는 엽산을 합성할 수 없기 때문에 원형질막에 있어 엽산을 바인드하고 흡수하는 특별한 시스템의 존재가 사실상 요구된다.\nSince animal cells are unable to synthesize folic acid, there is in fact a need for a special system in the plasma membrane that binds and absorbs folic acid.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n엽산은 뚜렷한 친수성 특이적인 특징을 나타내는 이가 음이온(dianion)인 한, 단순한 확산으로는 세포의 원형질막을 통해서 통과하기 어렵다. 단지 높은 약리학적 농도에서만 수동적인 확산으로 엽산 운반을 할 수 있다.\nFolic acid is difficult to pass through the plasma membrane of a cell with simple diffusion, as long as it is a divalent anion that exhibits distinct hydrophilic specific characteristics. Only at high pharmacological concentrations can folic acid be transported by passive diffusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n자연적 생리학 조건에서 엽산은 조직과 혈청 내에서 나노몰 농도로 발견되는데, 이것이 이러한 비타민을 흡수하고 운반하는 세포가 고도로 효과적인 특이한 막 시스템을 가지게 되는 이유이다.\nUnder natural physiological conditions, folic acid is found in nanomolar concentrations in tissues and serum, which is why cells that absorb and transport these vitamins have a highly effective specific membrane system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n높은 속도로 엽산 운반을 촉진하는 이동성 담체가 있다. 혈액으로의 엽산흡수가 일어나는 소장의 상피세포에 많이 존재한다. 촉매 운반은 다양한 세포에서 엽산 흡수의 주된 경로이다. 그러한 운반의 substrate는 복원된 형태의 엽산으로, 이는 상기 담체가 transporter of restored vectors (TRV)로 불리는 이유이다. 이는 46 kD의 크기을 가지는 당단백질으로 세포 원형질막 내에서 친수성 분자의 막을 통해서 생기는 \"채널(channel)\"을 형성한다. TRV 매개 운반의 동역학은 Michaelice-Menten 의존적인 것으로 설명된다. 작용하는 속도는 다소 높으며, 엽산과의 유사성은 대략 200 μM로 상대적으로 낮다.\nThere are mobile carriers that promote folic acid transport at high rates. It is present in the epithelial cells of the small intestine where folate absorption into the blood occurs. Catalytic transport is the main route of folic acid uptake in various cells. The substrate of such transport is folic acid in a restored form, which is why the carrier is called transporter of restored vectors (TRV). It is a 46-kD glycoprotein that forms a \"channel\" within the plasma membrane of the membrane through the membrane of hydrophilic molecules. The kinetics of TRV mediated transport are described as Michaelice-Menten dependent. The rate of action is rather high and the similarity with folic acid is relatively low, approximately 200 μM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTRV는 종양세포에서도 작용한다. 복원된 엽산의 결합력 K\nM\n은 1-4 μM 이내이다. 담체의 메토트렉세이트와의 유사성은 4-8 μM 이내에서 약간 더 낮은 K\nM\n이고, 그것의 운반 최대 속도는 세포 단백질 그램당 1-12 nmol/min 이내이다. TRV는 엽산의 막을 통한 운반을 수행할 수 있지만, 주어진 산소처리된 엽산에 대한 그것의 유사성은 낮다 (K\nM\n은 100-200 μM 이내이다).\nTRV also works in tumor cells. The binding force K \nM\n of restored folate is within 1-4 μM. The similarity of the carrier with methotrexate is slightly lower K \nM\n within 4-8 μM and its maximum transport rate is within 1-12 nmol / min per gram of cellular protein. TRV can perform transport through the membrane of folic acid, but its similarity to a given oxygenated folic acid is low (K \nM\n is within 100-200 μM).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n엽산수용체라고 불리는 막 당단백질을 통해 작용하는 수용체-매개의 시스템이 있다. 엽산수용체는 엽산에 대한 결합상수가 1 nM 미만이라는 점에서 substrata와 매우 유사하다는 특징을 가지고 있다.\nThere is a receptor-mediated system that works through membrane glycoproteins called folate receptors. Folic acid receptors are very similar to substrata in that the binding constant for folic acid is less than 1 nM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n엽산의 수용체 매개 운반은 한 방향 즉 세포 내부쪽으로만 수행된다. 정상조직의 세포들은 약간의 예외를 제외하고는 매우 적은 양의 엽산수용체만을 그 표면 상에서 발현한다. 그러나, 악성으로 형질변환된 세포들, 특히 폐, 신장, 뇌, 대장, 난소에서의 종양 세포와 백혈병에서의 골수 혈액 세포에서는 엽산에 대한 수용체의 양이 그들의 표면 상에서 증가하게 된다. 이러한 엽산수용체의 양적인 증가로 인해 엽산을 현저한 양(세포당 610\n7\n 분자 이상)으로 보다 효과적으로 바인딩할 수 있게 된다. 암세포의 진단에 사용되는 단일클론항체가 엽산과 매우 특이적으로 결합하는 것으로 나타나는 한, 이러한 당단백질은 종양 마커로서 언급되어질 수 있다.\nReceptor-mediated transport of folic acid is carried out only in one direction, ie inside the cell. Normal tissue cells express very small amounts of folic acid receptors on their surface with a few exceptions. However, in malignantly transformed cells, particularly tumor cells in the lungs, kidneys, brain, colon, ovaries and bone marrow blood cells in leukemia, the amount of receptors for folic acid increases on their surface. This quantitative increase in folate receptors allows for more efficient binding of folic acid in significant amounts (more than 610 \n7\n molecules per cell). Such glycoproteins may be referred to as tumor markers, as long as the monoclonal antibodies used for the diagnosis of cancer cells appear to bind very specifically with folic acid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n엽산의 수용체 매개 운반은 엔도시토시스 메커니즘을 통해서 수행된다. 수용체는 재순환 메커니즘(recirculatory mechanism)을 통해서 작동한다. 즉, 리간드가 분자를 결합하고 방출하면서, 반복적으로 원형질막으로부터 엔도솜으로 그리고 그 반대로 가로질러 통과한다. 그러한 기능의 효율성은 다음과 같은 다양한 요소들에 의해 규정된다: 세포 표면상의 수용체의 수, 세포 밖 엽산-리간드의 농도, 수용체에 대한 엽산의 유사성, 에너지-의존적 엔도시토시스의 속도, 엔도솜으로부터 수용체 분자 방출 속도, 막 내부에서 반복적으로 만들어지기 위한 수용체의 능력 등.\nReceptor-mediated transport of folic acid is carried out through endocytosis mechanisms. Receptors operate through a recirculatory mechanism. That is, the ligand repeatedly passes from the plasma membrane to the endosome and vice versa, binding and releasing the molecule. The efficiency of such function is defined by a variety of factors, including: the number of receptors on the cell surface, the concentration of extracellular folate-ligand, the similarity of folic acid to the receptor, the rate of energy-dependent endocytosis, from the endosome The rate of release of receptor molecules, the ability of the receptor to be made repeatedly within the membrane, and the like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n의약물과 결합한 엽산 결합물에서 엽산 수용체와 연합된 부분은 수용체-매개 엔도시토시스를 통해 세포로 들어가게 되고, 한편 다른 부분은 세포의 표면 상에 머물러 있게 될 것이다. 이에 따라 두 가지 타입의 치료 전략이 제안될 수 있다. 세포 내 타겟까지 접근할 필요가 있는 의약물은 엔도시토시스에 의해 시토졸로 운반될 수 있으며, 세포 밖 영역에서 작용할 수 있거나 작용해야 하는 의약물은 엽산수용체를 소비하면서 종양세포 표면 상에 축적될 것이다. \nThe portion associated with the folate receptor in the folate binding agent bound to the drug will enter the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis, while the other portion will remain on the surface of the cell. Accordingly, two types of treatment strategies can be proposed. Drugs that need to reach intracellular targets can be transported to the cytosol by endocytosis, and drugs that can or should act in the extracellular domain will accumulate on the tumor cell surface while consuming folic acid receptors. .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n주요한 특징은 약물이 병리적으로 변형된 세포에까지 직접 전달된다는 점이다. 치료효과를 가진 다양한 광민감제들을 이용하는 PDT의 경우, 종양 세포의 직접적인 손상이 아닌, 병소(pathological focus)의 생리학적 조건을 변화시키는 것을 통해 조정된다. 따라서, 친수성 염료(stains), 특히 Chlorin e6은 종양조직의 혈관 시스템의 광 손상에 민감하게 되고(광역학치료법의 혈관에 미치는 효과), 이는 형질 변환된 세포의 직접적인 비활성화를 유도하지 않고 종양의 성장을 억제한다. 광민감제를 종양에 선택적으로 운반하는 것은 PDT의 항암치료효과를 획기적으로 개선시킬 수 있는 한 가지 방법이 될 수 있음이 분명하다.\nThe main feature is that the drug is delivered directly to pathologically modified cells. PDT using a variety of photosensitive agents with therapeutic effects is mediated by changing the physiological conditions of the pathological focus, not directly damaging the tumor cells. Thus, hydrophilic stains, especially Chlorin e6, are sensitive to light damage of the vascular system of tumor tissues (effects on the blood vessels of photodynamic therapy), which does not induce direct inactivation of transformed cells and thus tumor growth. Suppress Selective delivery of photosensitizers to tumors is clearly one way to significantly improve the anticancer effects of PDT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n클로린 e6은 천연성분이며, 유기체의 정상적인 세포에는 독성이 없다. 또한 종양치료에 사용되는 다른 광활성 화합물들과 비교하여 악성 세포에 대해 높은 광화학 활성을 가진다.\nChlorine e6 is a natural component and is not toxic to normal cells of the organism. It also has high photochemical activity against malignant cells compared to other photoactive compounds used in tumor therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n클로린 e6은 혈액과 기관으로부터 종양부위로 빨리 도달한 후, 종양세포에 높은 농도로 축적된다.\nChlorine e6 quickly reaches tumor sites from blood and organs, and then accumulates in high concentrations in tumor cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n레이저에 의해 활성화된 클로린 E6는 종양에 대한 직접적인 파괴 효과뿐만 아니라 간접적으로도 세포면역을 약화시켜 항-종양 면역조절 효과를 제공한다. 염증 부위와 재생 조직에 클로린이 많이 축적되면 수술 후 상처의 회복이 보다 잘되게 하며 재감염을 막아준다.\nLaser-activated chlorine E6 provides an anti-tumor immunomodulatory effect by indirectly attenuating cellular immunity as well as indirectly damaging to tumors. Accumulated chlorine in the inflamed areas and regenerated tissues can help to recover from wounds better after surgery and prevent reinfection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n이에 본 발명자들은 상기와 같은 점을 감안하여 클로린 e6과 엽산을 헥산-1,6-디아민을 통해 말단 링커를 결합시킴으로써 다양한 매질에서 일중항 산소를 효과적으로 생성하고 종래 포르피린 계열의 광민감제에 비해 현저히 우수한 종양 선택성을 가짐으로써 악성종양에 대한 광역학치료에 유용한 특징을 가진 신규 클로린 e6-엽산 결합 화합물을 제조하고 상기 화합물이 종래 포르피린 계열의 광민감제에 비해 현저히 우수한 종양 선택성을 가짐으로써 악성종양에 대한 광역학치료에 유용함을 확인함으로써 본 발명을 완성하게 되었다.\nIn view of the above, the present inventors combine chlorine e6 and folic acid with a terminal linker through hexane-1,6-diamine to effectively generate singlet oxygen in various media and are significantly superior to conventional porphyrin-based photosensitizers.

It is known that a major role in this process is the abnormal operation of the cell membrane. This abnormal behavior is due to the oxidation of protein and lipid components by highly reactive oxidants such as singlet oxygen. This singlet oxygen is formed during the interaction between the oxygen molecules in the body and the photosensitizer molecules under an activated triplet condition. \n1\n efficiency of 0 \n2\n produced is determined by the following a number of factors, such as: absorption of the photosensitizer, the intensity and emission of triplet quantum conditions, the life of the above conditions, the present solubility and O \n2\n diffusion under the environment and the like. It should be noted here that the factors mentioned above can vary considerably during the transformation from homogeneous solutions of sensitizers to biological systems and their complexes that are characterized by significant heterogeneity. This is the reason for investigating the spectral-energy characteristics of Chlorin e6 conjugates in this experiment, and the efficiency of singlet oxygen production in various systems.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2-1 실험 방법\n2-1 Experiment Method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n안료 단백질 복합물은, 동일한 버퍼에서 녹인 특정한 양의 광민감제를, 인간 혈청 알부민(HAS) 용액에 첨가함으로써 형성되었다. 본 실험에서 HAS와 Chlorin e6결합물의 몰농도 비율은 2.5:1이었다. 유사한 방법으로 detergent micelle(Triton Х-100, С=10\n-3\nМ)에 광감제를 포함시켰다. 계란에서 지질의 겔 여과와 안료 분산을 통해 추출한 레시틴 유래의 단일층 리포좀과 클로린 결합물과의 복합체가 형성되었다.\nPigment protein complexes were formed by adding a certain amount of photosensitizer dissolved in the same buffer to human serum albumin (HAS) solution. In this experiment, the molar concentration of HAS and Chlorin e6 conjugate was 2.5: 1. In a similar manner, photosensitizers were included in detergent micelle (Triton Х-100, С = \n10-3\n М). A complex of lecithin-derived monolayer liposomes and chlorine conjugates was formed by gel filtration and pigment dispersion of lipids in eggs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n조사 대상 용액의 전자흡수 스펙트럼은 Specord UV-Vis 상에서 기록되었다. 형광 스펙트럼과 형광 극성도 (Р) 값은 자동 분광형광계(Institute of Physics) 상에서 기록되었다. 광민감제 형광의 수명(t\nS\n)은 광양자 계산 방식으로 작동하는 임펄스 형광계를 사용하여 측정하였다. \nElectron absorption spectra of the solution under investigation were recorded on Specord UV-Vis. Fluorescence spectra and fluorescence polarity (Р) values were recorded on an automated spectrofluorometer (Institute of Physics). The lifetime (t \nS\n ) of the photosensitive fluorescence was measured using an impulse fluorometer operating in the photon calculation method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nInP/InGaAsP 반도체 광음극을 가진 새로운 Hamamatsu FEU에 기초하여 nanosecond time resolution으로 950-1400 nm의 범위에서 발광(luminescence) 신호를 기록할 수 있는 매우 민감한 laser fluorometer를 사용했다.\nBased on the new Hamamatsu FEU with InP / InGaAsP semiconductor photocathodes, a highly sensitive laser fluorometer capable of recording luminescence signals in the range of 950-1400 nm with nanosecond time resolution was used.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2-2 분광학적 파라미터\n2-2 Spectroscopic Parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n실온 하의 약알칼리 버퍼 (рН 7.4 - 8.1)에서, Chlorin e6 결합물의 전자 흡수 스펙트럼은 수소화된 이중 C = C 결합을 갖는 포르피린 유리 염기의 특이적인 구조를 보였다(도 6). 흡수 스펙트럼의 주요 특징은 660 nm에서의 강한(ε = 4.8 10\n4\n M\n-1\ncm\n-1\n) Q\nx\n (0-0) 밴드이었고, 이 위치는 대부분의 생물학적 조직의 스펙트럼 창(spectral window)이 되었다.\nIn the weak alkali buffer at room temperature (рН 7.4-8.1), the electron absorption spectrum of the Chlorin e6 conjugate showed the specific structure of the porphyrin free base with hydrogenated double C = C bonds (FIG. 6). The main feature of the absorption spectrum was the strong (ε = 4.8 10 \n4\n M \n-1\n cm \n-1\n ) Q \nx\n (0-0) band at 660 nm, which became the spectral window of most biological tissues. .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n도 7은 버퍼에서의 Chlorin e6와 Chlorin e6 결합물의 형광 스펙트럼 및 형광 여기 스펙트럼을 보여준다. 두 안료의 형광 스펙트럼은 여기 파장에 의존하지 않았으며, 이들의 형광 여기 스펙트럼은 Chlorin e6의 흡수 스펙트럼과 거의 일치하였다. 다만 Chlorin e6 결합물의 여기 스펙트럼은 스펙트럼의 \"파란 영역\" 즉, 스펙트럼의 400~500nm 영역에서만 흡수 스펙트럼과 다르다는 점에 주목해야 한다. 결합물의 여기 스펙트럼에서 vectorial part(엽산)의 흡수에 상응하는 흡수 밴드는 나타나지 않았다.\nFigure 7 shows the fluorescence spectrum and fluorescence excitation spectrum of Chlorin e6 and Chlorin e6 combination in the buffer. The fluorescence spectra of the two pigments did not depend on the excitation wavelength, and their fluorescence excitation spectrum was almost identical to the absorption spectrum of Chlorin e6. It should be noted, however, that the excitation spectrum of the Chlorin e6 conjugate differs from the absorption spectrum only in the “blue region” of the spectrum, ie 400-500 nm region of the spectrum. There was no absorption band corresponding to the absorption of the vectorial part (folic acid) in the excitation spectrum of the binding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nChlorin e6 결합물과, HSA, 리포좀, 또는 detergent micelle이 복합체를 형성하게 되면 안료의 흡수 스펙트럼과 형광 스펙트럼에서 장파색방 이동(bathochromic shift)을 일으키게 된다. 그러나, 형광 광반응(B)의 증가가 관찰되었으며, 이는 Kravec 적분 값의 변화없이 수명이 증가(t\nS\n)하는 것과 관련이 있다.\nComplexation of chlorin e6 conjugates with HSA, liposomes, or detergent micelles results in a bathochromic shift in the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the pigment. However, an increase in fluorescence photoreaction (B) was observed, which is associated with an increase in lifetime (t \nS\n ) without changing the Kravec integral value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n표 1 \n \n다른 시스템에서 Chlorin E6 결합물의 형광 파라미터\n \n \n \n시스템(System)\n \n \n \nl\n \n \n00\n \n \n \nabs\n \n \nNm\n \n \n \nl\n \n \n00\n \n \n \nfl\n \n \nnm\n \n \n \nt\n \n \nS\n \n \nns\n \n \n \nB\n \n \n \n \nH\n2\nO, pH 8.1\n \n657\n \n664\n \n4.3\n \n0.16\n \n \n \nTriton X-100, pH 8.1\n \n665\n \n670\n \n5.7\n \n0.19\n \n \n \nHSA, pH 8.1\n \n664\n \n669\n \n5.2\n \n0.18\n \n \n \n리포좀(Liposomes), pH 8.1\n \n665\n \n670\n \n5.4\n \n0.21\n \n \n \n디메틸 설폭사이드\n \n661\n \n672\n \n4.6\n \n-\n \n \n \n피리딘\n \n666\n \n673\n \n5.0\n \n0.18\n \n \n \n테트라하이드로퓨란\n \n667\n \n573\n \n5.0\n \n-\n \n \n \n메탄올\n \n662\n \n667\n \n4.8\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n\n\nTable 1 \n \n Fluorescence Parameters of Chlorin E6 Bonds in Different Systems \n \n \n \nSystem\n \n \n \nl\n \n \n00\n \n \n \nabs\n \n \nNm\n \n \n \nl\n \n \n00\n \n \n \nfl\n \n \nnm\n \n \n \nt\n \n \nS\n \n \nns\n \n \n \nB\n \n \n \n \n H \n2\n O, pH 8.1 \n \n 657 \n \n 664 \n \n 4.3 \n \n 0.16 \n \n \n \n Triton X-100, pH 8.1 \n \n 665 \n \n 670 \n \n 5.7 \n \n 0.19 \n \n \n \n HSA, pH 8.1 \n \n 664 \n \n 669 \n \n 5.2 \n \n 0.18 \n \n \n \n Liposomes, pH 8.1 \n \n 665 \n \n 670 \n \n 5.4 \n \n 0.21 \n \n \n \n Dimethyl sulfoxide \n \n 661 \n \n 672 \n \n 4.6 \n \n - \n \n \n \n \nPyridine\n \n \n 666 \n \n 673 \n \n 5.0 \n \n 0.18 \n \n \n \n Tetrahydrofuran \n \n 667 \n \n 573 \n \n 5.0 \n \n - \n \n \n \n Methanol \n \n 662 \n \n 667 \n \n 4.8 \n \n - \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n매질의 극성이 감소하는 유기 용매에서도 Chlorin e6 결합물의 분광 파라미터의 유사한 변화가 관찰되었다.\nSimilar changes in the spectral parameters of the Chlorin e6 conjugate were observed in organic solvents with decreasing polarity of the medium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n얻어진 결과의 분석으로부터 모든 시스템에서의 Chlorin e6 결합물이 단량체적인 상태(monomeric state)에 있으며, 분광적 변화가 주로 배향 효과(orientational effects)에 의해 발생한다는 결론을 이끌어 낼 수 있다. 본 실험에서 특유하고 배향적인 상호 작용의 역할은 작았다. 모든 복합체에서 Chlorin e6 결합물은 극성이 피리딘과 동일한 소수성의 환경을 가진다.\nFrom the analysis of the results obtained, it can be concluded that the Chlorin e6 conjugates in all systems are in the monomeric state, and that spectral changes are mainly caused by orientational effects.

B + γ for all systems \n \n \n Regardless of its environment, the primary path of electronic excitation energy reduction in the molecules of the Chlorin e6 bonds is due to their mutual binding. The photoreactivity of this process is high (γ \n \n \n 0.7), appear substantially similar in all systems. However, the lifetime of the excited triplet state was markedly different in the oxygen-depleted solution (τ \nt\n \n0\n ) and in the oxygen-saturated solution (τ \nt\n ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n안료의 리포솜 형을 보면, 버퍼 용액에 비해서 τ\nt\n\n\n0\n 값이 거의 2.5배 정도 낮은 수준이다. 리포솜에서의 Chlorin e6 결합물의 P값(P = 0.13)이 높은 것은 지질 이중층 내에 안료가 다소 단단한 원형으로 존재한다는 증거이다. 이러한 상황과 함께, 리포솜과 복합체를 이루고 있는 Chlorin e6 결합물의 광물리학적 특성을 고려하면, τ\nt\n\n\n0\n의 값이 감소한 것으로 관찰되는 것은 아마도 불포화 지방산 지질 사슬의 탄소-탄소 이중결합에 의한 안료의 삼중항 상태의 퀀칭(quenching)에 의한 것이라고 추측할 수 있을 것이다.\nIn the liposome form of the pigment, the value of τ \nt\n \n0\n is almost 2.5 times lower than that of the buffer solution. The high P value (P = 0.13) of the Chlorin e6 binding in liposomes is evidence of the presence of a rather rigid circle of pigments in the lipid bilayer. With this situation, taking into account the photophysical properties of the Chlorin e6 conjugate complexed with liposomes, it was observed that a decrease in the value of τ \nt\n \n0\n was probably due to the triplet of the pigment by the carbon-carbon double bond of the unsaturated fatty acid lipid chain. It can be inferred that this is due to quenching of the term state.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2-4 산소 분자에 의한, Chlorin e6 결합물의 여기된 삼중항 상태의 퀀칭\nQuenching the excited triplet state of the Chlorin e6 conjugate by 2-4 oxygen molecules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n상기 표 2에 제시된 데이터는, 용액과 생체 시스템에 있는 산소 분자가 Chlorin e6 결합물의 여기된 삼중항 상태를 퀀칭하는 특이적인 특징을 분석하는데 도움을 준다. τ\nt\n\n\n0\n과 τ\nt\n의 얻어진 값, 수용액에서의 O\n2\n의 농도(2.6 × 10\n-4\n M), 피리딘에서의 O\n2\n의 농도(8.3 × 10\n-4\n M)를 고려하고, 또한 물과 막(membrane) 간의 분배비가 3과 동일하다는 점을 고려하면, 다음 수학식 2를 이용하여 산소로 Chlorin e6 결합물의 삼중항 상태를 퀀칭하는 이분자적 속도상수를 측정할 수 있다.\nThe data presented in Table 2 above help to analyze the specific characteristics of the oxygen molecules in solution and the biological system quenching the excited triplet state of the Chlorin e6 conjugate.

The excited state was performed on a wavelength of 531 nm (\npulse energy\n 4 microJ, \nfrequency\n 1 kHz). The test was made in buffer saturated with air at room temperature.

K\nτ\n < K\nΔ\n 인 경우에는, 일중항 산소 발광의 동역학이 역으로 일어나게 된다. 이 경우, k\n2\n = K\nτ\n이며 k\n1\n = K\nΔ\n 이다. Extinguishers가 존재하지 않는, 공기로 포화된 용액 내에서서는 첫번째 경우가 실현되었다. 따라서, 동역학 데이터에 근거하여 일중항 산소의 수명과 삼중항 상태의 수명을 계산할 수 있다.\nWhen the deactivation rate constant K \nτ\n of the photosensitizer triplet state exceeds the deactivation constant K \nΔ\n of the oxygen molecule triplet state, the increasing constant k \n1\n corresponds to K \nτ\n and the extinction constant k \n2\n corresponds to K \nΔ\n . When K \nτ\n <K \nΔ\n , the dynamics of singlet oxygen emission are reversed. In this case, k \n2\n = K \nτ\n and k \n1\n = K \nΔ\n . The first case was realized in an air saturated solution without extinguishers. Therefore, the lifetime of singlet oxygen and the lifetime of triplet state can be calculated based on the kinetic data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n그러므로, 동역학 곡선에 근거해서 다음과 같이 Chlorin e6 결합물의 τ\nt\n 및 τ\nΔ\n의 값을 얻었다: 2.0±0.2 microsec. 및 3.6±0.2 microsec. Chlorin e6 결합물의 삼중항 상태의 수명의 언급된 값들은, flesh-photolysis의 방법을 통해서 얻은 τ\nt\n 및 문헌으로부터 알려진 값인 τ\nΔ\n와 상관이 있다. Chlorin e6 결합물의 일중항 산소의 광민감성 형태(photosensitizing form) 광반응은 용액의 рH를 0.7(рH 8.1) 내지 0.52(рH 6.0)로 낮춤에 따라 감소하였다. 이는 pH를 낮춤에 따라 Chlorin e6 결합물의 결집이 발생하는 것과 관련이 있다. \nTherefore, based on the kinetic curves, the values of τ \nt\n and τ \nΔ\n of the Chlorin e6 conjugate were obtained as follows: 2.0 ± 0.2 microsec. And 3.6 ± 0.2 microsec. The stated values of the lifetime of the triplet state of chlorin e6 conjugates correlate with τ \nt\n obtained through the method of flesh-photolysis and τ \nΔ\n , a known value from the literature. The photosensitizing form of singlet oxygen of chlorin e6 conjugates decreased with decreasing the рH of the solution from 0.7 (рH 8.1) to 0.52 (рH 6.0). This is related to the aggregation of chlorin e6 conjugates as the pH is lowered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[규칙 제26조에 의한 보정 20.07.2009]　\n\n상기 표 2에서 분명하게 볼 수 있듯이, 피리딘과 버퍼 용액 내에서 Chlorin 결합물의 분자들은 \n1\nO를 매우 효율적으로 생성하였다. 용액 내 단백질의 존재는 τ\nΔ\n를대략 1.1까지 감소시키는데, 이는 이분자적 퀀칭 상수,   \n = 1.5 × 10\n8\n M\n-1\nc\n-1\n에 상응하는 것이다. 용액 내 안료 농도(3.1×10\n-6\n M) 및 단백질의 농도(C\nσ\n= 9.3×10\n-6\nM), 상수값(κ\nCB\n=1.2×10\n6\nM\n-1\n) 및 Chlorin e6 결합물(n = 1)과 결합하는 위치의 수를 알고 있으므로, 다음 수학식 3을 사용하여 안료-단백질 복합체에 포함된 민감제 분자의 점유율을 측정할 수 있다.\n\n[Revision 20.07.2009 under Rule 26] \n As can be clearly seen in Table 2, the molecules of the Chlorin conjugate in pyridine and buffer solution produced \n10\n O very efficiently.

However, the kinetics of accumulation appear differently. While most free Chlorin e6 accumulates in the cells within 5 hours, the accumulation of Chlorin e6 conjugates is increasing linearly over 20 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n6시간 배양한 후에, Chlorin e6 결합물의 축적 수치가 유리 Chlorin e6의 축적 수치보다 뚜렷하게 높게 나타나고 있다(도 9).\nAfter 6 hours of incubation, the accumulation level of Chlorin e6 conjugates was clearly higher than that of free Chlorin e6 (FIG. 9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n24시간 노출한 후에 Chlorin e6 결합물의 축적 수치는 유리 Chlorin e6의 축적 수치보다 평균적으로 8-10배 가량 높게 나타났다. Chlorin e6 결합물의 축적 수치가 24시간에 걸쳐 지속적으로 증가하였는데, 이는 비특이적인 세포 흡수 보다는 수용체-매개의 엔도시토시스를 통한 활발한 운반이 일어남을 시사하는 것이다.\nAfter 24 hours of exposure, the accumulation of Chlorin e6 conjugates was on average 8-10 times higher than that of free Chlorin e6. Accumulation levels of chlorin e6 conjugates increased continuously over 24 hours, suggesting that active transport through receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs rather than nonspecific cell uptake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n외인성 엽산의 존재가 유리 Chlorin e6 와 Chlorin e6 결합물의 헬라 세포내의 축적에 미치는 영향을 조사하기 위해서, 엽산을 유리 Chlorin e6 와 Chlorin e6 결합물 첨가 전에 4 μM/l의 농도로 세포 현탁액에 첨가한 후에 유리 Chlorin e6와 Chlorin e6 결합물과 함께 24시간 동안 배양했다. 이후에 시료를 원심분리하고, 상청액을 수거하고 침전물을 차가운 Hank's 용액 내에서 다시 세척하였다. 수득된 두번째 침전물을 다시 Hank's 용액에 넣었다.\nTo investigate the effect of the presence of exogenous folic acid on the HeLa cell accumulation of free Chlorin e6 and Chlorin e6 conjugates, folic acid was added to the cell suspension at a concentration of 4 μM / l before the addition of free Chlorin e6 and Chlorin e6 conjugates. Incubated with free Chlorin e6 and Chlorin e6 combination for 24 hours. The sample was then centrifuged, the supernatant was collected and the precipitate washed again in cold Hank's solution. The second precipitate obtained was put back into Hank's solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n형광 세기를 측정하여 헬라 세포 내 유리 chlorin e6과 chlorin e6 결합물의 축적량을 비교하였다.\nFluorescence intensity was measured to compare the accumulation of free chlorin e6 and chlorin e6 conjugates in HeLa cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n24시간 노출 후에, Chlorin e6 결합물의 축적량이 유리 Chlorin e6의 축적량보다 많았다. 도 10은 4 μM/l의 유리 엽산이 헬라 세포에서의 Chlorin e6 결합물의 축적을 상당량 감소시켰음을 보여준다(\np < \n0.05). 반면에 엽산의 존재는 유리 Chlorin e6의 축적량에는 영향을 미치지 않았다. 사실상, Chlorin e6의 세포 내 축적은 배양 매질 내 길항적인 농도의 엽산의 존재에 의해 영향을 받지 않았다. 그러나, 길항적인 엽산의 존재 하에서 Chlorin e6 결합물의 축적이 감소하더라도, 여전히 유리 Chlorin e6에 비해서는 우월한 것으로 나타났다. 이는 엽산의 존재가 또한 비특이적인 축적을 증가시킬 수 있음을 제시하는 것이다.\nAfter 24 hours of exposure, the accumulation of Chlorin e6 conjugates was greater than that of free Chlorin e6. FIG. 10 shows that 4 μM / l of free folic acid significantly reduced the accumulation of Chlorin e6 conjugates in HeLa cells ( \np <\n 0.05). On the other hand, the presence of folic acid did not affect the accumulation of free Chlorin e6. In fact, intracellular accumulation of Chlorin e6 was not affected by the presence of antagonistic concentrations of folic acid in the culture medium. However, even though the accumulation of Chlorin e6 conjugates decreased in the presence of antagonistic folic acid, it was still shown to be superior to free Chlorin e6. This suggests that the presence of folic acid can also increase nonspecific accumulation.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n3.2 세포독성(항증식성 분석)\n3.2 Cytotoxicity (Antiproliferative Assay)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n세포의 증식 과정 강도, 광민감제의 농도, 및 광학적 파워를 고려하여 세포 독성을 조사하였다\n. \n이를 위해 단일층의 세포를 담은 3개의 플라스크가 사용되었다.\nCytotoxicity was investigated in consideration of cell proliferation intensity, photosensitizer concentration, and optical power \n.\n Three flasks containing a single layer of cell were used for this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n세포로는 헬라 종양 세포의 단일층 배양물을 사용하였다.\nAs a cell, a monolayer culture of HeLa tumor cells was used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n헬라 종양 세포의 배양물을 영양배지 199, 또는 10% 우태아 혈청 및 100 mg/ml의 카나마이신을 첨가한 헤모히드롤리제이트 함유 영양 배지 내에서 성장시켰다.\nCultures of Hela tumor cells were grown in nutrient medium containing \nnutrient medium\n 199, or 10% fetal calf serum and 100 mg / ml kanamycin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n플라스크 내에 세포 배양물을 접종(영양 배지 2.0 ml 당 100,000 cells) 한 후 4일째에 광민감제를 각각 1, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0 mg/ml씩 첨가하였다.\nOn \nday\n 4 after inoculating the cell cultures (100,000 cells per 2.0 ml of nutrient medium), photosensitizers were added at 1, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0 and 30.0 mg / ml, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n광-보호 커버(dark cytotoxicity)를 가진 플라스크는 1 시간 동안 37.5 ℃에서 배양하였다. 세포를 Hank's 용액을 이용하여 4회 세척하였다. 신선한 영양 배지 2.0 ml를 첨가하고 \"METALAZ\" 레이져 의료기구(파장 627.8 nm, 578.2 또는 510.6 nm) 또는 \"LD 680-2000\"(파장 670-690 nm) (조사하고자 하는 광민감제의 분광학적 최대 흡수 파장에 따라)의 광선속(light flux)으로 5, 10, 15 또는 20 분 동안 얼음이 녹는 온도에서 40 J/㎠의 조사량으로 조사하였다. 20-24 시간 후에 Goriaev's 챔버 내에서 종양 세포를 계수하였다.\nFlasks with dark cytotoxicity were incubated at 37.5 ° C. for 1 hour.

Overexpression of certain receptors is often used for oncoselective delivery of photosensitizers. In HeLa cells that overexpress folate receptors, folate-targeting ligands are used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nChlorin e6 결합물의 헬라 세포에의 축적은 엽산 특이적인 것이며 비결합 Chlorin e6보다 훨씬 더 크게 이루어진다고 결론 내릴 수 있다.\nIt can be concluded that the accumulation of chlorin e6 conjugates in HeLa cells is folate specific and much greater than that of unbound chlorin e6.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n실험예 4: 본 발명 Chlorin e6 결합물의 생체 내 생물학적 효과 조사\nExperimental Example 4: In vivo biological effect of the present invention Chlorin e6 conjugate\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n4-1 사코마 M-1 래트에 대한 광 노출시 광민감제의 축적 동역학\n4-1 Accumulation Kinetics of Photosensitive Agents on Light Exposure to Sacoma M-1 Rats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n먼저, 사코마 M-1 래트에 대한 광 노출시 광민감제의 축적 동역학를 조사하였다. \nFirst, the accumulation kinetics of photosensitizers upon light exposure to Sacoma M-1 rats were investigated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n광민감제로는 Chlorin e6과 Chlorin e6 결합물을 비교하였으며, 상기 광민감제를 사코마 M-1 래트에 2.5, 5.0 및 10.0 mg/kg의 양으로 정맥 투여한 다음 종양 조직과 정상 조직 내 두 광민감제의 축적 동역학을 분석하였다.\nThe photosensitizers were compared with Chlorin e6 and Chlorin e6 conjugates. The photosensitizers were administered intravenously in Sacoma M-1 rats in the amounts of 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg / kg, followed by two photosensitisers in tumor and normal tissues.

The photosensitizers were administered once intravenously to each group of rats in low light rooms in amounts of 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg / kg, respectively. Sterile natural isotonic solution of sodium chloride was used as solvent.

For this purpose, a laser-fiber spectrum analyzer \"LESA-6\" was used with a helium-neon diagnostic laser \"LHN 633-25\". This allowed local assessment of the accumulation of photosensitizers in any organ or tissue that the fiber probe could reach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n실시간 모니터링을 위해서 약제투여후 매시간 카테터의 끝부분을 종양 조직과 정상조직 위에 올려놓고 약제축적의 강도를 최대 형광에 대응하는 파장에서 기록했다.\nFor real-time monitoring, the catheter tip was placed on tumor tissue and normal tissue every hour after drug administration and the intensity of drug accumulation was recorded at the wavelength corresponding to maximum fluorescence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n고려되어진 지수의 획득한 디지털 수치를 컴퓨터 프로그램 Origin 6.1을 사용하여 일반적으로 인정된 통계기법으로 처리하였다. 유의수준은 0.05이었다.\nObtained digital values of the indexes considered were processed using generally accepted statistical techniques using the computer program Origin 6.1.

Comparing the accumulation in the induced sacoma, it was confirmed that the Chlorin e6 conjugate was much more tumor-oriented than Chlorin e6. Therefore, it can be seen that the efficiency of phototherapy with Chlorin e6 combination is significantly superior to Chlorin e6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n본 실험결과를 고려해볼 때, Chlorin e6 결합물은 다양한 매질에서 일중항 산소를 효과적으로 생성하기 위한 최적의 특성을 가지고 있다는 결론을 내릴 수 있다. 또한 종양세포와 조직에 대한 Chlorin e6 결합물의 독특한 향성(tropism)을 고려해보면, Chlorin e6 결합물이 현재 알려져 있는 모든 포르피린 계열의 다른 광민감제들을 뛰어넘는 높은 광역학적 활성을 가진다는 것을 알 수 있을 것이다.\nConsidering the results of this experiment, it can be concluded that the Chlorin e6 combination has the optimal properties for the efficient production of singlet oxygen in various media. In addition, considering the unique tropism of the Chlorin e6 binding to tumor cells and tissues, it can be seen that the Chlorin e6 binding has a high photodynamic activity over all other porphyrin-based photosensitive agents currently known. ."

Description\n\n\n\n\nThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/030,031, filed on Jan. 3, 2002, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is in the field of molecular biology and diagnostics. In particular, the invention relates to a diagnostic assay for human Matrix Gla-protein (MGP), and its use as a biomarker for vascular conditions and vascular new formation.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nCardiovascular disease is one of the major life-threatening diseases in Western society, but biomarkers to monitor the severity or the progression of the disease are presently not available. Also, the number of biochemically detectable risk factors (e.g., serum cholesterol, triglycerides, ApoE genotype) is surprisingly low.\n\n\nVitamin K is a cofactor in the posttranslational conversion of glutamate residues into γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla). At this time, 10 mammalian Gla-containing proteins have been described in detail, and the number of Gla-residues per molecule varies from 3 (osteocalcin) to 13 (protein Z). In all cases in which their function was known, the activity of the various Gla-proteins was strictly dependent on the presence of the Gla-residues (Shearer, M. J., Brit. \nJ. Haematol\n. (1990) 75:156-162; Vermeer, C., \nBiochem. J\n. (1990) 266:625-636). Gla-proteins are synthesized in various tissues, for instance the liver, bone and vessel wall. Blood coagulation factors 11 (prothrombin), VII, IX and X are examples of Gla-proteins synthesized in the liver, examples of so-called extrahepatic Gla-proteins are osteocalcin and Matrix Gla-Protein (Hauschka, P. V. et al., \nPhys. Rev\n. (1989) 69:990-1047).\n\n\nMatrix Gla-Protein is a vitamin K-dependent protein synthesized in bone and in a number of soft tissues including heart and vessel wall. In experimental animals its soft tissue expression is high immediately after birth, but decreases in the months thereafter. Only in cartilage and arteries does its expression seem to continue lifelong. Although the precise function of MGP on a molecular level has remained unknown so far, experiments with MGP-deficient transgenic animals (“knock-out” mice) have shown that MGP has a prominent role in the prevention of vascular mineralization: MGP-deficient animals are born to term but develop severe aortic calcification (as analyzed by X-ray) in the first weeks of life; and eventually all animals die within 6-8 weeks after birth due to rupture of the aorta or one of the other main arteries (Luo, G. et al., \nNature \n(1997) 386:78-81).\n\n\nMGP contains five Gla-residues which are essential for its calcification-inhibitory function. This was discovered by Price et al., who treated rats with the vitamin K-antagonist warfarin thus blocking the formation of Gla-residues (Price, P. A. et al. Arterioscler. \nThromb. Vasc. Biol\n. (1998) 18: 1400-1407). The treatment protocol induced vitamin K-deficiency in the vasculature and lead to vascular calcification within 3 weeks. Hence an inadequate vitamin K-status leading to incomplete MGP carboxylation is a risk factor for cardiovascular calcification. Conformation-specific antibodies recognizing either carboxylated (=active conformation containing 5 Gla-residues/mol) or under-carboxylated (=inactive conformation containing less than 5 Gla-residues/mol) are a powerful tool in the diagnostics of cardiovascular disease.\n\n\nMGP was discovered in bone (Price, P. A. et al., \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun\n. (1983) 117:765-771), but in situ hybridization experiments showed that it is also expressed in other tissues including the vessel wall (Fraser, D. J. et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem\n. (1988) 263:11033-11036). With polyclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide homologous to the C-terminus of bovine MGP, the protein was also found in cartilage via immunohistochemical staining (Loeser, R. F. et al., \nBiochem. J\n. (1992) 282:1-6). A radioimmunoassay was developed for the detection of serum MGP in the rat, but in these experiments circulating MGP was correlated with maturation of rat bone, and not with vascular biology (Otawara, Y. et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem\n. (1986) 261:10828-10832).\n\n\nResearch concerning the role of MGP in the vessel wall has not started before the discovery by Luo et al. (supra) that MGP is a strong inhibitor of vascular calcification in mice. Since then, evidence has accumulated suggesting that bone calcification and atherosclerotic vessel wall calcification proceed via very similar mechanisms, in which the same proteins (including MGP) are used (Proudfoot, D. et al., \nArterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol\n. (1998) 18:379-388; Proudfoot, D. etal., \nJ. Pathol\n. (1998) 185:1-3). Most studies on the regulation of MGP expression have been performed in smooth muscle cell cultures, with mRNA detection as a measure for MGP synthesis. Recent studies in humans have shown that, although MGP mRNA is constitutively expressed by normal vascular smooth muscle cells, it is substantially upregulated in cells adjacent to both medial and intimal calcification (Shanahan, C. M. et al., \nCrit. Rev. in Eukar. Gene Expr\n. (1998) 8:357-375).\n\n\nThe prior art neither teaches nor suggests the use of MGP as a marker for angiogenesis or cardiovascular disease, or the like, nor does it disclose an assay for circulating MGP in humans.\n\n\nAs stated above, biomarkers to monitor the severity or the progression of cardiovascular disease are not available up till now, and the number of biochemically detectable risk factors is very low. Therefore, there is clearly a need for biomarkers for vascular characteristics, for assessment of the severity or progression of atherosclerosis and related diseases, as well as for monitoring the effect of treatment during vascular disease.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a diagnostic assay, preferably immunoassay, is provided for the detection and determination of MGP in a human serum sample, which comprises the use of one or more antibodies, in particular monoclonal antibodies, specifically recognizing epitopes on and/or conformations of human Matrix Gla-Protein (human MGP).\n\n\nThe invention further includes a method for the production of such antibodies.\n\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, a method is included for the production of chimeric recombinant MGP constructs which are recognized by said antibodies.\n\n\nIn yet another aspect of the invention, an assay is included wherein said antibodies and said chimeric recombinant MGP constructs recognized by said antibodies are used, allowing the detection of MGP, either (a) the total immunoreactive antigen, carboxylated, or (b) the fraction of carboxylated (=5 Gla-residues/mol), or (c) the fraction of undercarboxylated MGP (≦4 Gla-residues/mol), in human serum.\n\n\nIn still a further aspect of the invention, a method is included for using MGP-related antigens as biomarkers for certain diseases, for example, atherosclerosis and other vascular diseases, and angiogenesis/neogenesis in tumor development, and diseases of the cartilage, such as osteoarthritis, Bechterew's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment of the invention, monoclonal antibodies of class IgG are included for use in said diagnostic immunoassay which are obtainable by hybridomas formed by fusion of cells from a mouse myeloma and spleen cells from a mouse previously immunized with a peptide homologous to certain human MGP residues, in particular one of human MGP residues 3-15, human MGP residues 35-49, human MGP residues 35-53, human MGP residues 54-84, and human MGP residues 61-79, which antibodies are also referred to herein as mAb3-15, mAb35-49, mAb35-53, mAb54-84, and mAb61-79, respectively. Of these, mAb3-15, mAb35-49, and mAb35-53 are preferred antibodies. Of these, mAb61-79 and mAb54-84 can be used for detecting MGP without regard to its state of posttranslational modification. Peptides of residues 35-49 are used in two different conformations: those containing glutamic acid at positions 37, 41, and 48 and those containing Gla at those positions. Peptides of residues 35-53 are also used in two different conformations: those containing glutamic acid at positions 37, 41, 48, and 52 and those containing Gla at those positions. These peptides are designated as 35-49[Glu], 35-49[Gla], 35-53[Glu], and 35-53[Gla], respectively.\n\n\nThe present invention includes cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies specific for human MGP, conformations of human MGP, and regions of human MGP, methods of making cell lines that produce antibodies specific for human MGP, conformations of human MGP, and regions of human MGP, monoclonal antibodies specific for human MGP, conformations of human MGP, and regions of human MGP, diagnostic assays for human MGP, and kits for assaying or detecting human MGP, conformations of human MGP, and fragments of human MGP.\n\n\nThe present invention includes a method of detecting one or more diseases or disorders of the human vascular system, or diseases or disorders of human cartilage, comprising exposing a human serum sample to a monoclonal antibody capable of recognizing an epitope of human MGP.\n\n\nThe present invention also includes a method for detecting one or more diseases or disorders of the human vascular system, or diseases or disorders of human cartilage, comprising exposing a human serum sample to a polyclonal antibody capable of recognizing an epitope of human MGP.\n\n\nThese and other aspects of the present invention will be more fully outlined in the detailed description which follows.\n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n represents the assessed DNA nucleotide sequence and its derived amino acid sequence of insert, e.g., MGP linked to murine dihydrofolate reductase (“DHFR”) and equipped with a N-terminal 6-His tag.

See also SEQ ID NOS: 1 and 2.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n shows a dose-response reference curve for MGP in human reference serum. Points are means of duplicate measurements made on 12 different days; error bars represent standard deviation.\n\n\n \nFIG. 3\n shows the species specificity of MGP-assay. A dose-response curve for human serum MGP was compared with undiluted rat (□) and mouse (˜) serum. No response was obtained for the rodent sera.\n\n\n \nFIG. 4\n shows inter-individual variations in serum MGP levels. Five volunteers (30-50 year old males) were tested.\n\n\n \nFIG. 5\n shows blocking MGP antibodies with peptide 3-15. The stock solution (100%) of peptides was 1.3 μg/ml. Peptide dilutions (□) instead of serum were incubated with antibodies and the excess of antibodies was assessed with the microtiter plate assay. For comparison, reference serum in various dilutions (□) was taken in the same run.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 6-9\n show serum MGP concentrations of patients suffering from atherosclerosis, coronary atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus and malignancies, respectively, and of comparative groups of healthy people. These results are also summarized in Table 1.\n\n\n \nFIG. 10\n depicts the reactivity of mAb\n3-15 \nantibodies with purified rMGP (A) and rOC (B). The amount of recombinant protein on the microtiter plate was quantitated with anti-6His antibodies (□), the reactivity with mAb\n3-15 \nwas tested in the same plate (□). In both cases staining was performed by incubation with a second antibody (rabbit anti-mouse total IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase) as described below in Materials and Methods.\n\n\n \nFIG. 11\n shows the absence of circadian pattern for circulating human MGP. Points represent means ±SD for twelve different subjects; nine blood samples were obtained during the first 24 hours, and 5 samples were obtained at 9 a.m. during the following two months.\n\n\n \nFIG. 12\n illustrates the antigen-capture technique: triplicate measurements of the standard reference curve were prepared on three consecutive days. Unknown plasma or serum samples can be read from the curve. In this technique, a labeled tracer peptide (MGP\n3-15\n) was added to the serum, whereas monoclonal antibodies (mAb3-15) were coated onto the microtiter plate. The apparent MGP concentrations in the test sample are based on the assumption that the affinities of tracer and native MGP for the antibody are similar.\n\n\n \nFIG. 13\n shows the means of triplicate MGP-measurements in pooled plasma at various plasma dilutions using the sandwich ELISA technique. In this technique monoclonal antibodies against the MGP mid-sequence (mAb35-49) were coated onto the microtiter plate whereas biotinylated mAb3-15 was used as a second antibody. Error bars represent SD.\n\n\n \nFIG. 14\n illustrates immunohistochemical localization (pink color) of MGP species in coronary atherosclerosis.

For all stages: Left, total MGP (mAb3-15); right, under-carboxylated MGP (mAb35-53).\n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\n\nThe present invention is based on the surprising discovery that the vitamin K-dependent matrix Gla-protein, MGP, appears to play a key role in preventing vascular calcification. MGP is synthesized in a vitamin K-dependent way in smooth muscle cells of the healthy vessel wall and its mRNA transcription is substantially upregulated in atherosclerotic lesions.\n\n\nMGP is a protein that contains five glutamate residues, which may be modified by the addition of an extra carboxyl group. Whereas unmodified glutamate is abbreviated as Glu, carboxylated glutamate is designated as Gla. Gla residues are formed in a reaction in which vitamin K acts as a coenzyme. Human MGP contains 84 amino acid residues, with Gla residues at \npositions\n 2, 37, 41, 48, and 52 (Kiefer et al. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16:5213). The Gla residue at \nposition\n 2 is not regarded as part of human MGP's “Gla-domain,” because it is atypically located. Thus, the Gla domain in human MGP may contain four Gla residues. The Gla-residues in MGP are an absolute requirement for its biological activity.\n\n\nA typically Western type of diet contains insufficient vitamin K to fully carboxylate all Glu residues in MGP into Gla residues. As a consequence, non-carboxylated species of MGP are formed in a normal, “healthy” human population. These non-carboxylated, or under-carboxylated, species have no biological activity. The normal biological activity of MGP is inhibition of vascular calcification.\n\n\nInhibition of vascular calcification is an important factor in mediating the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases and disorders. At least two MGP-associated risk factors exist for cardiovascular disease. The risk factors are (1) low constitutive expression of MGP, in any of its forms (active or inactive), and (2) poor, under- or non-carboxylation of MGP, which can lead to a lessened ability of MGP to inhibit the calcification process.\n\n\nThe present invention includes cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies specific for human MGP and regions of human MGP, methods of making cell lines that produce antibodies specific for human MGP and conformations of human MGP, monoclonal antibodies specific for human MGP and conformations of human MGP, diagnostic assays for human MGP, and kits for assaying or detecting human MGP and conformations of human MGP. In this context “conformations of MGP” refers to MGP species containing or lacking posttranslationally modified amino acid residues. The methods and compositions of the present invention are particularly useful for detecting or monitoring diseases or disorders of the human vascular system and diseases or disorders of human cartilage.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the present invention includes cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies from a mouse previously immunized with a peptide homologous to certain human MGP residues, in particular human MGP residues 3-15, human MGP residues 35-49[Glu], human MGP residues 35-49[Gla], human MGP residues 35-53[Glu], human MGP residues 35-53[Gla], human MGP residues 54-84, and human MGP residues 61-79, which antibodies are also referred to herein as mAb3-15, mAb35-49[Glu], mAb35-49[Gla], mAb35-53[Glu], mAb35-53[Gla], mAb54-84, and mAb61-79, respectively. Of these, mAb3-15, mAb35-49[Glu] and mAb35-53[Glu] are preferred antibodies for detecting MGP lacking posttranslational modifications. Of these, mAb61-79 and mAb54-84 are preferred for detecting MGP without regard to its state of posttranslational modification. Methods of making the cell lines are included, monoclonal antibodies produced by the cells are included, and kits for assaying or detecting human MGP comprising the antibodies are included. The monoclonal antibodies mAb3-15, mAb61-79, and mAb54-84 allow for identification of human MGP without regard to human MGP's carboxylation state. The remainder of the antibodies are directed to regions that include glutamines that can be carboxylated. Thus, the present invention allows for characterization of human MGP in carboxylated forms and in uncarboxylated forms, as well as without regard to state of postranslational modification.\n\n\nIn

recognizes an epitope in human matrix Gla protein residues 61-79, or 54-84, or a combination thereof, the one or more monoclonal antibodies being present in a predetermined amount so that a portion of the one or more monoclonal antibodies remain uncomplexed to the human matrix Gla protein present in the sample; and measuring the amount of uncomplexed one or more monoclonal antibodies so as to

wherein an higher or lower level of human matrix Gla protein in said serum sample is associated with a disease, including, for example, coronary atherosclerosis, vascular calcification, angiogenesis,

disease, and rheumatoid arthritis, thereby monitoring or detecting coronary atherosclerosis, vascular calcification, angiogenesis, a disease of the vascular system, diabetes mellitus, ectopic calcification in tumor development, or diseases or disorders of human cartilage.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention includes a monoclonal antibody of class IgG, comprising a monoclonal

Deutsche Sammiung von Mikroorganizmen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSMZ) as accession number DSM ACC2639.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention includes a hybridoma cell line 52.1#1 deposited

and determination of MGP in a human serum sample, which comprises the use of one or more antibodies specifically recognizing epitopes on and/or conformations of human Matrix Gla-Protein. In a preferred embodiment, the assay is an immunoassay. In any of these embodiments, the antibodies can be monoclonal antibodies. The diagnostic assay can employ one or more of mAb3-15, mAb35-49[Glu], mAb35-49[Gla], 35-53[Glu], and 35-53[Gla], alone or in combination with mAb61-79, or 54-84.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention includes a chimeric recombinant MGB construct, comprising a chimeric recombinant MGB construct that is recognized by one or more of the antibodies of the aforementioned embodiments.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention includes one or more MGP conformations or MGP-related antigens, or one or more fragments of MGP, as biomarkers for one or more diseases. The invention also provides uses of total MGP, specific MGP conformations or an MGP-related antigen, or a fragment of MGP in monitoring a disease or disorder, wherein the disease or disorder is selected from atherosclerosis and other vascular diseases, angiogenesis/ neogenesis in tumor development, and a disease or disorder of human cartilage. The disease or disorder of human cartilage includes, for example, osteoarthritis, Bechterew's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention includes a monoclonal antibody of class IgG produced by a hybridoma formed by fusion of cells from a mouse myeloma and spleen cells from a mouse previously immunized with a peptide homologous to human MGP residues 3-15, which antibody is defined herein as mAb3-15.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention includes a monoclonal antibody of class IgG produced by a hybridoma formed by fusion of cells from a mouse myeloma and spleen cells from a mouse previously immunized with a peptide homologous to human MGP residues 35-49[Glu], which antibody is defined herein as mAb35-49[Glu].\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention includes a monoclonal antibody of class IgG produced by a hybridoma formed by fusion of cells from a mouse myeloma and spleen cells from a mouse previously immunized with a peptide homologous to human MGP residues 35-49[Gla], which antibody is defined herein as mAb35-49[Gla].\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention includes a monoclonal antibody of class IgG produced by a hybridoma formed by fusion of cells from a mouse myeloma and spleen cells from a mouse previously immunized with a peptide homologous to human MGP residues 35-53[Glu], which antibody is defined herein as mAb35-53[Glu].\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention includes a monoclonal antibody of class IgG produced by a hybridoma formed by fusion of cells from a mouse myeloma and spleen cells from a mouse previously immunized with a peptide homologous to human MGP residues 35-53[Gla], which antibody is defined herein as mAb35-53[Gla].\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention includes a monoclonal antibody of class IgG produced by a hybridoma formed by fusion of cells from a mouse myeloma and spleen cells from a mouse previously immunized with a peptide homologous to human MGP residues 61-79, which antibody is defined herein as mAb61-79.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention includes a monoclonal antibody of class IgG produced by a hybridoma formed by fusion of cells from a mouse myeloma and spleen cells from a mouse previously immunized with a peptide homologous to human MGP residues 54-84, which antibody is defined herein as mAb54-84.\n\n\nIn still another aspect of the invention, a kit is included, comprising a device suitable for carrying out the diagnostic assay according to the present invention, including one or more antibodies specifically recognizing epitopes on and/or conformations of human Matrix Gla-Protein, chemical agents useful or necessary to carry out the assay, which are familiar to the persons skilled in the art, and preferably instructions on how the assay is to be carried out in an optimal way.\n\n\nOne advantage of the present invention is the ability to fully characterize the carboxylation state of a sample of human MGP. In accordance with the present invention, this information will provide data as to risk of diseases or disorders including, but not limited to, diseases or disorders related to vascular calcification and diseases or disorders of human cartilage. The sample is subjected to analysis using the compositions and methods of the present invention in, for example, an immunoassay. Convenient immunoassays include, for example, enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), immunohistochemical techniques, and Western blots.\n\n\nFor those monoclonal antibodies generated using peptides that are not carboxylated, samples of human MGP with carboxylated residues will not bind with monoclonal antibodies generated using peptides that are not carboxylated. Thus, an indication that an antibody binds to MGP in a given sample comprising human MGP is indicative that the human MGP of the sample is not carboxylated at the residue corresponding to the particular monoclonal antibody (i.e., mAb3-15, mAb35-49[Glu], mAb35-53[Glu], mAb61-79, and mAb54-84). Similarly, for monoclonal antibodies that can be generated using peptides containing Gla-residues, samples of human MGP with non-carboxylated residues would not bind with monoclonal antibodies generated using peptides containing Gla-residues. In this case, an indication that an antibody binds to MGP in a given sample comprising human MGP is indicative that the human MGP of the sample is carboxylated at the residue corresponding to the particular monoclonal antibody (i.e., mAb35-49[Gla], mAb35-53[Gla) .\n\n\nWith this disclosure in hand, and by observing the reactivity pattern of a sample to the monoclonal antibodies of the present invention, a person of ordinary skill in the art can determine the ratio between carboxylated and under-carboxylated MGP, which is a determinant of the calcification inhibitory activity of MGP. In addition, ratios of reactivity of a sample to the aforementioned monoclonal antibodies to reactivity of the sample to mAb61-79 or mAb54-84 can be generated, providing even more information about the sample, for example, relative level of postranslational modification (e.g., carboxylation) with respect to total human MGP (as measured by mAb61-79 or mAb54-84, respecitvely). Ratios of reactivity can be determined using any method known in the art, for example, ELISA. For anti-MGP35-49[Glu] and anti-MGP35-53[Glu], less than 5% cross-reaction with carboxylated MGP is observed.\n\n\nThe methods and compositions of the present invention can also be used to monitor changes in the carboxylation status of human MGP. For example, a human sample can be assayed using the methods and compositions of the present invention to establish a baseline level of carboxylation of MGP in a human. A change in the carboxylation state of the human's MGP can then be determined following any therapy, drugs, protocols, or treatments known or suspected to affect vascular calcification, diseases related to vascular calcification, or level of carboxylation of human MGP.\n\n\nThe present invention also includes the use of serum MGP levels as a biomarker for one or more human diseases. In this regard, serum levels of MGP can be related to the occurrence, onset, progression, or regression of one or more diseases, as described herein. For example, the present disclosure describes the phenomenon that circulating MGP is correlated to cardiovascular calcification, coronary atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, malignancies, diseases or disorders of the cardiovascular system, and diseases or disorders of human cartilage, for example, osteoarthritis, Bechterew's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of MGP can also be used to monitor efficacy of treatment regimens for the aforementioned diseases, or the efficacy of vitamin K administration therapies, vitamin K inhibitor therapies, or therapies affecting vitamin K metabolism. Serum levels of MGP can also be used to monitor the efficacy of dietary regimens aimed at increasing vitamin K levels. For example, serum levels of MGP can be used to identify groups in a mammal population, for example a human population, which might benefit most from vitamin K-enriched foods or vitamin K-enriched food supplements.\n\n\nAccordingly, the present invention includes a method for detecting one or more diseases or disorders of the human vascular system or one or more diseases of human cartilage, comprising exposing a human serum sample to an antibody capable of recognizing an epitope of human MGP. The antibody can be a monoclonal antibody or a polyclonal antibody. Preferably, the antibody is a monoclonal antibody.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the method for detecting one or more diseases or disorders of the human vascular system comprises exposing a human serum sample to an antibody capable of recognizing an epitope of human MGP, determining the level of MGP in the human serum sample, comparing the level of MGP in the human serum sample to a serum level of MGP in a human population sample, and determining whether the level of MGP in the human serum sample is higher or lower than the serum level of MGP in the human population sample. In one embodiment, the epitope of human MGP is found in the group consisting of human MGP residues 3-15, 35-49, 35-53, and 61-79. In another embodiment, the one or more diseases or disorders of the human vascular system is vascular calcification. In another embodiment, the one or more diseases or disorders of the human vascular system is coronary atherosclerosis. In another embodiment, the one or more diseases or disorders of the human vascular system is a vascularized neoplasm. Preferably, the vascularized neoplasm is a malignant tumor. In another embodiment, the one or more diseases of human cartilage includes osteoarthritis, Bechterew's disease, or rheumatoid arthritis. In another embodiment, the monoclonal antibody is capable of recognizing a carboxylated epitope on human MGP and the monoclonal antibody is incapable of recognizing a noncarboxylated epitope on human MGP. In yet another embodiment, the monoclonal antibody is capable of recognizing a noncarboxylated epitope on human MGP and the monoclonal antibody is incapable of recognizing a carboxylated epitope on human MGP. In yet another embodiment, the monoclonal antibody does not distinguish between carboxylated and noncarboxylated forms of human MGP.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention includes a method for detecting one or more diseases or disorders of the human vascular system, or one or more diseases or disorders of human cartilage, comprising exposing a human serum sample to a polyclonal antibody capable of recognizing an epitope of human MGP.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention includes a method for detecting one or more diseases or disorders of the human vascular system, or one or more diseases or disorders of human cartilage, comprising exposing a human serum sample to a polyclonal antibody capable of recognizing an epitope of human MGP, determining a level of MGP in the human serum sample, comparing the level of MGP in the human serum sample to a serum level of MGP in a human population sample, and determining whether the level of MPG in the human serum sample is higher or lower than the serum level of MGP in the human population sample. In one embodiment, the one or more diseases or disorders of the human vascular system is coronary atherosclerosis. The polyclonal antibody can be an antibody directed against MGP or a fragment thereof.\n\n\nUpon exposure of a human serum sample to an antibody capable of recognizing human MGP, a level of MGP in the human serum sample can be determined, by any method known in the art, preferably using the compositions of the present invention. Once a level in the human serum sample is obtained, the level in the human serum sample can be compared to the average level of serum MGP in a human population. This human population can be selected by any suitable method known in the art, including a random sample of humans. The human population can be as small as a few persons, or as large as many thousands or persons. Preferably, the human population is large enough that, when compared with the human serum sample to be tested, the human population sample is capable of yielding a statistically significant difference between the human population sample and a serum sample of an individual with a disease or disorder of the vascular system or a disease or disorder of cartilage, for example, coronary atherosclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis, at the 95% or better confidence level.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the monoclonal antibody recognizes an epitope of human MGP found in the group consisting of human MGP residues 3-15, 35-49, 35-53, and 61-79. However, any monoclonal antibody capable of being employed in a human serum assay would suffice.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the one or more diseases or disorders of the human vascular system is coronary atherosclerosis. In another embodiment, the one or more diseases or disorders of the human vascular system is a vascularized neoplasm. The vascularized neoplasm can be, for example, a malignant tumor. In accordance with the disclosure herein, levels of serum MGP are elevated in patients with a vascularized neoplasm.\n\n\nThe monoclonal antibody employed to detect MGP in a human serum sample may be specific for a carboxylated epitope, specific for a noncarboxylated epitope, or incapable of distinguishing between a carboxylated and non-carboxylated epitope on MGP.\n\n\nPreferably, the human population sample is substantially free of mascular disease or cartilage disease. By “substantially free of vascular disease or cartilage” is meant that at least 80% of the human population sample has not been diagnosed with a vascular disease or disorder or a disease of the cartilage. More preferably, at least 90% of the human population sample has not been diagnosed with a vascular disease or disorder or a disease of the cartilage. Most preferably, at least 99% of the human population sample has not been diagnosed with a vascular disease or disorder or a disease of the cartilage. The phrase “vascular disease or disorder” includes, for example, moderate to severe cardiovascular calcification, moderate to severe coronary atherosclerosis, type I diabetes mellitus, and neoplastic growths that are vascularized such as, for example, malignant tumors. The phrase “disease of the cartilage” includes, for example, moderate to severe osteoarthritis, Bechterew's disease, and moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. More preferably, less than 30% of the human population sample displays clinical manifestations of vascular disease or cartilage disease. Most preferably, less than 10% of the human population sample displays clinical manifestations of vascular disease or cartilage disease. It is preferable that the human population sample be minimized with respect to any disease or disorder that would tend to affect levels of serum MGP.\n\n\nPreferably, serum MGP is detected using an immunoassay. An immunoassay employs the interaction between an antigen (for example, human MGP or a fragment thereof) and an antibody (for example, an antibody or monoclonal antibody, or fragment thereof, directed against human MGP). Serum MGP can be measured using the methods and compositions disclosed herein. Any suitable immunoassay method or platform now known in the art, or that comes to be known, can be used in conjunction with the methods and compositions of the invention. For example, ELISAs, sandwich assays, Western blots, and the like can be used in conjunction with the present invention to detect serum MGP levels.\n\n\nThe methods and compositions of the present invention can be employed in validation of therapies, drugs, protocols or treatments related to (1) vascular calcification, (2) diseases or disorders related to vascular calcification, (3) diseases or disorders of human cartilage, or (3) manipulation of the carboxylation state of MGP, whether directly acting on MGP or acting on a pathway that might result in a change of carboxylation state of MGP. One non-limiting example of such a use is to assay samples from a human over time, using the methods and compositions of the present invention, where the human is a subject in a clinical study of the efficacy or safety of a composition that affects, directly or indirectly, the carboxylation state of human MGP.\n\n\nThe methods and compositions of the present invention can be employed where human MGP and/or one or more of its carboxylated forms, is employed as a surrogate marker for a disease or disorder in a human. The term “surrogate marker” is meant to include the use of a first characteristic of a sample to infer a second characteristic of the sample, or of the organism from which the sample is derived. In this regard, a surrogate marker is typically correlated with a disease or disorder or a susceptibility thereto. For example, the first characteristic can be under-carboxylation or non-carboxylation of human MGP. Or the first characteristic can be, for example, the level of MGP in serum. The second characteristic can be the occurrence of, or susceptibility to, atherosclerosis. The correlation between the first characteristic and the second characteristic need not be perfect. Preferably, the correlation between the first characteristic and the second characteristic is from 0.1 to 0.3 (positive or negative). More preferably, the correlation is from 0.3 to 0.5 (positive or negative). Even more preferably, the correlation is at least 0.5 (positive or negative). Most preferably, the correlation is at least 0.9 (positive or negative).\n\n\nIn order to investigate the potential value of MGP, or a functional part or derivative thereof, as a biomarker for vascular and cartilage characteristics, MGP and fragments thereof were prepared synthetically and assays were developed for the detection both of MGP in tissue, in particular vascular tissue, and of circulating MGP. The methods described herein have been used to construct mAb3-15, mAb35-49[Glu], and mAb35-53[Glu]. The methods described herein can be used to construct other antibodies to human MGP, including, for example, mAb35-49[Gla], mAb35-53[Gla], mAb54-84, and mAb61-79. The methods herein can also be used to develop assays for the detection and assessment of diseases of the cartilage, for example, osteoarthritis, Bechterew's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nBy way of example, the inventors have determined that in all stages of atherosclerosis, vitamin K-deficiency was demonstrated. See \nFIG. 14\n. This identifies atherosclerotic patients as a group who might benefit from vitamin K-supplements, which is of importance for public health and for the health food industry.\n\n\nMGP, or functional fragments thereof, can be obtained in various ways, for example by recovering from a natural source, chemical synthesis, or using recombinant DNA techniques.\n\n\nIn bone, MGP accumulates in relatively large quantities, which is why bone is the only tissue from which native MGP has been isolated thus far (Price, supra). However, under physiological conditions, MGP originating from human and bovine bone is one of the most insoluble proteins known.\n\n\nThe nucleotide and amino acid sequences of human MGP are shown in \nFIG. 1\n. Comparison between its primary structure and the amino acid sequence derived from cDNA coding for MGP shows that in bone-derived MGP the last 7 C-terminal amino acids are missing (Hale, J. E. et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem\n., (1991) 266:21145-21149).\n\n\nFor the purpose of the present invention, synthetic peptides homologous to certain sequences of human MGP, for example, to the MGP sequences 3-15, 35-49[Glu], 35-49[Gla], 54-84, and 61-79 were synthesized chemically and purified. Sequences as those mentioned above will be referred to hereinafter as MGP\n3-15\n, MGP\n35-49\n[GIu], MGP\n35-49\n[Gla], MGP\n54-84\n, and MGP\n61-79\n, respectively. Further, polyclonal antibodies were generated using MGP sequences 61-79.\n\n\nA synthetic peptide homologous to residues 35-53[Glu] and 35-53[Gla] can be synthesized chemically and purified. Such synthetic peptides are designated MGP\n35-53\n[Glu] and MGP\n35-53\n[Glu], respectively.\n\n\nMGP can also be made using recombinant DNA techniques. When produced by recombinant techniques, standard procedures for constructing DNA encoding the antigen, cloning that DNA into expression vectors, transforming host cells such as bacteria, yeast, insect, or mammalian cells, or any suitable expression system known in the art, and expressing such DNA to produce the antigen may be employed. It may be desirable to express the antigen as a fusion protein to enhance expression, facilitate purification, or enhance solubility.\n\n\nFor example, first a DNA encoding the mature protein (used here to include any maturation form) is obtained. mRNA coding for MGP can be isolated from, e.g., cultured human osteoblasts, and converted into the corresponding cDNA using well-known techniques. Alternatively, mRNA coding for MGP can be obtained from other cell types, such as chondrocytes or smooth muscle cells. If the sequence is uninterrupted by introns, genomic or cDNA is suitable for expression in any host. If there are introns, expression is obtainable in eukaryotic systems capable of processing them. This sequence should occur in an excisable and recoverable form. The excised or recovered coding sequence is then placed in operable linkage with suitable control sequences in a replicable expression vector. The vector is used to transform a suitable host and the transformed host is cultured under favorable conditions to effect the production of the recombinant protein. To improve the efficacy of prokaryotic MGP expression, the cDNA may be equipped with an extension encoding a second protein in such a way that expression will give rise to a chimeric fusion protein.\n\n\nGenomic or cDNA fragments can be obtained and used directly in appropriate hosts, for example, \nE. coli\n. The constructs for expression vectors operable in a variety of hosts are made using appropriate replication and control sequences, as exemplified below. Suitable restrictions sites can, if not normally available, be added to the ends of the coding sequence so as to provide an excisable gene to insert into these vectors.\n\n\nThe control sequences, expression vectors, and transformation methods are dependent on the type of host cell used to express the gene. Generally, prokaryotic, yeast and other eukaryotic cells (e.g., fungi, mammalian, insect, and plant cells) are presently available as hosts. Host systems which are capable of proper post-translational processing are preferred.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, MGP is suitably expressed as a chimeric protein linked to murine dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and equipped with a N-terminal 6-His tag for rapid purification; see \nFIG. 1\n and SEQ ID NOS: 1 and 2. The obtained 6-His tagged chimeric protein was poorly soluble under physiological conditions. It is used for coating the microtiter plates in the assay which will be described below. Instead of DHFR, other proteins of sufficient size to efficiently express a chimeric protein with MGP may be selected, known in the art, such as maltose binding protein.\n\n\nA chemical detection method is used employing one or more monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibody may suitably be human, mouse, rat or Camelidae (e.g., llama) monoclonal antibody prepared by conventional methods, including those methods currently available for producing monoclonal antibodies on a commercial scale, genetically engineered monoclonal antibodies, or antibodies fragments or antibodies produced by in vitro immunization by certain cells, and by phage display techniques. Also, one or more polyclonal antibodies can be suitably employed, preferably antibodies generated in rabbit or goat.\n\n\nThe monoclonal antibodies are conveniently generated from mice which are immunized with human MGP or a fragment thereof, for example MGP\n3-15\n, MGP\n35-49\n[Glu], MGP\n35-49\n[Gla] MGP\n35-53\n[Glu] MGP35-53[Gla], MGP54-84, or MGP\n61-79\n. Suitable and preferred monoclonal antibodies against human MGP are obtained from Balb/C mice which are immunized, e.g., with the peptide MGP\n3-15\n, the peptide MGP\n35-49\n[Glu], or the peptide MGP\n35-53\n[Glu], using post-immune sera screening for their affinity toward purified recombinant MGP, which was used as a chimeric construct with DHFR; see below. In parallel, the antisera and culture media were also screened using synthetic peptides as affinity ligands. In this manner, monoclonal antibodies reactive against epitopes in human MGP residues 3-15, 35-49[Glu], and 35-53[Glu] were created. Monoclonal antibodies directed against other epitopes in MGP, such as those mentioned above and described herein, can be made in accordance with the methods described herein.\n\n\nDetection and quantitation of circulating MGP, which includes MGP-related antigen, can also be performed in various ways. In accordance with the present invention we have developed an ELISA-based serum assay, a so-called “antibody-capture” assay in which the sample MGP is complexed with an excess of purified monoclonal anti-MGP antibody, whereas in a second step the remaining unbound antibodies are quantified after binding to insolubilized recombinant MGP. Recorded immunoreactive MGP turned out to be independent of sample preparation and showed small within-day and day-to-day fluctuations.\n\n\nBesides the antibody capture technique and the competitive ELISA technique, which are both single-antibody ELISA assays, the sandwich ELISA assay can also be conveniently used for the detection and quantification of circulating MGP, depending on the availability of a suitable second antibody. Below we will first describe the development of the antibody-capture technique, followed by a more detailed description of the antigen-capture and sandwich ELISA techniques, respectively, as illustrated in \nFIGS. 12 and 13\n.\n\n\nDose-response curves were prepared with various dilutions of normal pooled serum and plasma. We found that these curves were reproducible in time with linear curves between 2- and 10-fold dilutions. Intra- and inter-assay variations in control samples were 12 and 15%, and little cross reaction was observed with serum from other species including mouse and cow.\n\n\nNo circadian fluctuations were observed in a group of 6 men and 6 women (see \nFIG. 11\n). The range in the adult male population was found to be between 60 and 150% of the mean. MGP was independent of age in a reference group of men and women >55 years old. After immunohistochemical staining of vascular material, a low but distinct MGP deposition was observed in medial smooth muscle cells. Strongly increased deposition of MGP was observed in the center of the lipid core in advanced plaques, and in the border zones of mineral deposits.\n\n\nSince it seems hard to envisage that a focal burst of MGP synthesis would trigger calcification, it seems likely that MGP expression is a response to the precipitating mineral. Diabetics form a high risk group for developing media sclerosis, and therefore we have monitored circulating MGP in this patient group. It turned out that circulating MGP concentrations in type I diabetics (n=12) were significantly higher than in age- and sex-matched healthy controls, and the difference was statistically significant. In a group of 26 patients with coronary atherosclerosis, serum MGP was even further increased. In a cohort of 200 subjects no correlation was found between serum MGP and intima thickness (intima/media ratio). In subjects with postmenopausal osteoporosis or other metabolic bone disease, serum MGP levels were within the normal range.\n\n\nFrom the data obtained so far we conclude that our assay for serum MGP is reproducible, that arterial calcification is associated with increased MGP deposition, and that in advanced atherosclerosis the increased MGP synthesis is reflected in its serum concentration. Apart from further elaboration and fine-tuning, which is well within the level of ability of a person of ordinary skill in the art in light of the disclosure of the present invention, the MGP assay is useful as a diagnostic tool for diagnosis or patient follow-up during the treatment of, for example, atherosclerosis and, possibly, related diseases, such as, for example, diseases of cartilage.\n\n\nThe following is a typical example and preferred embodiment of the invention illustrating the preparation of a monoclonal antibody specifically recognizing epitopes and/or conformations on human Matrix Gla-protein, and various other aspects.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nA. Preparation of Recombinant Human MGP\n\n\nFor cloning and expression of the chimeric construct of murine dihydrofolate reductase and MGP (DHFR-MGP) the commercially available QlAexpress system was used (Qiagen Inc.). Fusion proteins were constructed using the pQE40 vector, which contains an expression cassette consisting of the phage T5 promoter fused to the mouse DHFR protein. To facilitate protein purification by metal chelate affinity chromatography, the recombinant protein was engineered to contain a six residue long histidine tail preceding the DHFR. For in frame fusion with the start codon of the 6-His region the expression vector pQE40 was linearized with the restriction enzymes SphI and HindIII (Gibco BRL). Subsequently, the linearized vector was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis according to standard procedures.\n\n\nFor cloning of the human MGP cDNA, 5′-SphI and 3′-HindIII digestion sites were introduced by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers MGPHUMT1 and MGPHUMT3 (for details see below) were used for amplification of cDNA coding for Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-MGP. Each PCR reaction consisted of 5 μl cDNA, 1 mM of each dNTP, 1 μg of each primer, 4 mM MgCl\n2\n, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 0.01% gelatin, and 2.5 U of Taq polymerase (Pharmacia) in a total volume of 50 μl. Each PCR cycle consisted of 1 min at 95° C., 2 min at 60° C. and 2 min at 72° C. The amplified cDNA was digested with SphI and HindIII (Gibco-BRL) and the resulting fragments were then separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and isolated thereof by electro-elution. The isolated fragments and linearized vector were then ligated in reactions containing 1 μl digested fragment, 1 μl digested pQE40 vector (in a weight ratio of 3:1), and subsequently transformed into \nE. coli \nstrain M15 [pREP4]. Reaction conditions were: 1×T4 DNA ligase buffer, 1 mM ATP, and 1 Weiss Unit of T4 DNA ligase (Pharmacia Biotech). Ligations were performed overnight at room temperature in a total volume of 10 μl. For the identification of clones expressing a 6-His tagged DHFR protein fused to MGP, the colony blot procedure was used according to the QIA Expressionist manual.\n\n\nSequence analyses were performed on an ABI 310 genetic analyzer (Perkin Elmer) according to the cycle sequencing procedure of the manufacturer. In brief, approximately 0.5 μg of CsCl\n2 \npurified ds-DNA was added to a reaction mixture which included 8 μl Terminator Ready Reaction Mix (Perkin Elmer) and 5 pmol of an appropriate primer in a total volume of 20 μl adjusted with H\n2\nO. Cycle sequencing was performed on a Thermo Cycler 9600 (Perkin Elmer) according to the following protocol. Each cycle consisted of 30 s at 95° C., 15 s at 60° C., and 4 min at 72° C. After 25 cycles, the procedure was terminated by a rapid ramp to 4° C. Subsequently, the products were purified on MicroSpin S-200 HR columns (Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in H\n2\nO according to the manufacturer's protocol. Finally, samples were precipitated with ethanol, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in 25 μl of Template Suppression Reagent (Perkin Elmer). Prior to loading the samples on the ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyser, samples were heated at 95° C. for 2 min. Sequence analysis of the samples was performed according to the manufacturer's manual.\n\n\nAll primers necessary for PCR and cycle sequencing were commercially manufactured by Perkin Elmer or Eurogentec with the following sequences:\n\n \n \n \n \nMGPHUMT1 (5′→3′), for SphI restriction site at 5′ end of human Xa-MGP: tat gca tgc att gaa ggt cgt tat gaa tca cat gaa agc (SEQ ID NO: 3)\n \nMGPHUMT 3 (5′→3′), for HindIII restriction site at 3′ end of human Xa-MGP: tat aag ctt ttt ggc ccc tcg gcg ctt cct (SEQ ID NO: 4)\n\n\nB. Characterization of Expression Product\n\n \n \n \n\n\nAll DNA fragments obtained through restriction enzyme digestion were purified using the QlAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen).\n\n\nIle-Glu-Gly-Arg-MGP cDNA was ligated into pQE40 and resulted in a correct plasmid construct: pQE40-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-MGP as was established with CsCl\n2 \npurified DNA of the construct, sequenced on an ABI Prism 310 sequencer. It was verified that the construct corresponded to pQE40 Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-MGP and that it was in the correct reading frame (see \nFIG. 1\n; SEQ ID NO:1). Calculated characteristics of the recombinant fusion protein 6His-DHFR-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-hMGP are: Mw=34.787 kD, 297 amino acid residues, pl=9.59. The resulting plasmid was transformed into \nE. coli \nstrain M15 [pREP4].\n\n\nThe construct was transformed into \nE. coli \nstrain BL21 [DE3, pREP4], which is deficient in the Ion and ompT proteases. Selection of recombinant protein producing clones through the colony blot procedure and using the 6-His monoclonal antibodies demonstrated several MGP producing clones. From small-scale expression experiments, followed by analysis of the product by poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western-blotting, cross reaction with 6-His monoclonal antibodies demonstrated a specific binding against a protein with the expected molecular weight of approximately 35 kD and a minor band of 28 kD.\n\n\nFrom the foregoing it can be concluded that good expression of the Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-MGP constructs as a part of a 6-His DHFR fusion protein in the pQE expression vector was accomplished in \nE. coli \nstrain BL21 [DE3, pREP4].\n\n\nC. Preparation of Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\nBalb/C mice were immunized intraperitoneally either with a synthetic peptide homologous to the N-terminus of human MGP (residues 3-15), or synthetic peptides homologous to the mid-fragment of human MGP (residues 35-49 [Glu]); or a synthetic peptide homologous to the C-terminus of human MGP (residues 54-84), which were coupled respectively to keyhole limpet hemacin (KLH from Pierce, product nr. 77107). The antigen (20 μg) was mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant and used for the first immunization. The animals were boostered every second week with 20 μg of antigen in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Post-immune sera were screened with an indirect ELISA using purified recombinant 6-His-DHFR-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-hMGP derived from \nE. coli\n, as described below.\n\n\nFor the screening of post immune sera of mice and cell supernatants an indirect ELISA was used in which the purified recombinant protein 6-His-DHFR-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-hMGP was bound to the solid phase. The stock solution of protein was diluted with sodium carbonate buffer (0.067 M NaHCO\n3\n, 0.033 M Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, pH 9.6) to the required concentration (e.g., 50 fold), and used to coat the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (Costar, cat. no. 3590) by incubation for 1 hour at 37° C. After coating, the plates were washed three times with washing buffer (0.3% Tween-20 in phosphate buffered saline) and 50 μl of either post-immune serum or cell supernatant were transferred into the coated microtiter plates and incubated for one h at 37° C. to achieve complete binding of the antibodies. Plates were washed three times with washing buffer and subsequently incubated for one h at 37° C. with 50 μl of a solution containing 1 μg/ml of rabbit anti mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Dako, product nr. P0161) in washing buffer. Non-bound conjugated antibodies were removed by washing and 50 μl of TMB substrate (Roche) were transferred to each well; after 10 minutes reaction was stopped with 100 μl of H\n2\nSO\n4\n. Optical densities were read at 450 nm in an EIA reader (Bio-Rad, model 550). Post immune sera were diluted 100 times in 2% non fat dry milk (Protifar from Nutricia Holland) in phosphate buffered saline before use.\n\n\nSpleen cells of good responding mice were fused with \nSp\n 2/0 Ag 14 myeloma cells. Cell suspensions were dispensed in ten 96-well microtiter plates and hybridomas were cultured for first 5 days in HAT selective medium containing RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, cat. nr. 21060-017), 15% fetal clone serum (Hyclone-Greiner, cat. nr. A-6165), 1 mM pyruvate (Gibco, cat. nr. 11840-048), 2 mM L-glutamin (Serva, product nr. 22942), growth factor ESG (Costar), 1 mg/ml gentamycin (A.U.V. Cuijk Holland, cat. nr. VPK 62389) and 2% (v/v) 50× HAT. After 5 days half of the medium was refreshed with medium with same contents except that HAT was replaced by 2% (v/v) 50× HT (Gibco, cat. nr. 41065-012). After 11 days the cell supernatants of hybridoma cells were screened using the ELISA technique described above. Single cell cloning of positive hybridoma cultures was performed by limiting dilution (see: \nAntibodies, A Laboratory Manual \nby E. Harlow and D. Lane, 1986, p. 222). This technique was repeated two more times for obtaining a monoclonal hybridoma cell line.\n\n\nThe antibody producing hybridoma clone was grown in a roller bottle flask with 1 liter RPMI 1640 medium containing 3% fetal clone serum, 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamin and gentamycin at 37° C. for two weeks. Culture media were separated from the cells by centrifugation, and IgG was isolated from the cell supernatants by protein-G Sepharose column chromatography (Pharmacia, cat. nr. 17-0618-02). Eluate fractions with A\n280\n>0.1 were pooled and concentrated using a concentrator filter with a 10 kD cut-off value. The yield was approximately 20 mg IgG per liter of culture medium, the material obtained was stored at −20° C. at a concentration of 1 mg/ml.\n\n\nIn a similar way antibodies against other peptides, MGP\n35-49\n[Glu], and MGP\n35-53\n[Glu], have been prepared.\n\n\nSimilarly, antibodies against other peptides, such as MGP\n35-49\n[Gla], GP\n35-53\n[Gla], MGP\n61-79\n, and MGP54-84 can be prepared.\n\n\nD. Characterization of Antibodies\n\n\nAntibodies were characterized by the Western blot technique, in which total bacteria lysates were separated using an SDS-page minigel electrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis had been completed, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by blotting. Staining with the antibody resulted in a distinct protein band at 35 kDa. This is the expected molecular weight of the fusion protein 6-His-DHFR-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-hMGP. Monoclonal antibodies are of subclass type IgG\n1 \nas determined with the mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kit (Gibco, cat no. 10126-027). The monoclonal antibodies thus prepared will also be referred to as mAb3-15, mAb35-49[Glu], and mAb35-53[Glu], respectively. Preferred monoclonal antibodies of the present invention are mAb3-15 and mAb35-49[Glu]. Monoclonal antibodies can also be prepared against human MGP residues, such as, for example, MGP\n35-49\n[Gla], MGP\n35-53\n[Gla], MGP\n54-84\n, and MGP\n61-79 \nwhich would be designated mAb35-49[Gla], mAb35-53[Gla], mAb54-84, and mAb61-79, respectively. Preferred monoclonal antibodies of the present invention would include mAb35-49[Gla] and mAb35-53[Gla].\n\n\nE. The Use of Antibodies in Assays for Circulating MGP\n\n\nThree procedures for the MGP assay were worked out: the antibody-capture ELISA and the competitive ELISA both enable the detection of full length and fragmented MGP, and the sandwich ELISA, which allows the specific recognition of intact molecules only.\n\n\nE1. Procedure for the Antibody-capture ELISA.\n\n\nIn this assay a known excess of antibody is mixed with the test solution containing an unknown amount of antigen, and the mixture is added to a microtiter plate coated with antigen. Non-bound antibody from the test sample will be bound to the microtiter well, and is quantified with a second (labeled) antibody.\n\n \n \n \n \nUrea-solubilized recombinant 6His-DHFR-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-hMGP is diluted 50 fold with coating buffer (0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) and used for coating an excess of 6His-DHFR-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-hMGP of the microtiter plates (50 μl in each well), the plates are allowed to stand for 1 h at 37° C.;\n \nRemaining active sites are blocked with blocking buffer (Roche Diagnostics Blocking reagent, cat nr. 1 112 589), 100 μl/well for 1 h at 37° C.;\n \nAfter repeated washing with washing buffer (0.3% (w/v) Tween-20 in phosphate-buffered saline) the plates are ready for use;\n \nSerum or plasma samples are supplemented with antibody solution (1 μg/ml in 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature;\n \nThe samples (50 μl) are than transferred to the microtiter plates and incubated for 1 h at 37° C.;\n \nAfter washing 3 times with PBS/Tween buffer (see above) the amount of antibody bound to the plate is quantified using a second antibody: rabbit anti-mouse total IgG labeled with horse radish peroxidase (Dako, 1 μg/ml in PBS-Tween buffer) for TMB-staining (TMB enzymatic kit from Roche);\n \nAfter 15 min incubation the reaction is stopped by adding 1 M H\n2\nSO\n4 \nwhereafter the plate is read at 450 nm.\n\n\nE2. Procedure for the Competitive ELISA\n\n \n \n \n\n\nIn this assay a known amount of labeled antigen (the tracer) is mixed with the test solution containing an unknown amount of antigen, and the mixture is added to the microtiter-bound antibody. The antigen in the test solution will compete with the tracer for binding to the antibody matrix.\n\n \n \n \n \nBiotinylation of tracer. A synthetic peptide analogous to the amino acid sequence 3-15 in human MGP (MGP\n3-15\n) is used as a tracer. Biotin-X-NHS (Calbiochem #2031188) is diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml and added to MGP\n3-15 \n(2 mg/ml in 0.1 M Na-borate buffer pH 8.5). Incubate at room temperature for 3 h in the dark. Remove the unbound biotin by overnight dialysis against phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and store the labeled peptide in the dark at 4° C. after adding sodium azide to a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v).\n \nCoating of microtiter plates. mAb3-15 antibodies (5 mcg/ml in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, 0.1 ml per well) are immobilized in wells of a high binding 96-well microtiter plate (Corning #3590). After incubation for 1 h at 37° C. remaining active sites are blocked with blocking reagent (Roche, 0.125 ml for 1 h at room temperature). All subsequent washing steps between the various incubations are performed with 0.05% (v/v) tween-20 in 0.225 ml PBS.\n \nSample preparation. Prepare the following sample tubes:\n        \n \nnon-specific signal tube (blanc): 0.250 ml PBS/Tween (0.05%, v/v)\n \ntotal signal tube: 0.125 ml PBS-Tween (0.05% v/v)\n \nunknown sample tube: 0.120 ml PBS-Tween (0.05%, v/v)+0.05 ml sample\n \nstandard tubes containing 0.125 ml of unlabelled MGP\n3-15 \nin concentrations: 20, 10, 4, 2,1, 0.4, and 0.2 nM.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nAdd 0.125 ml of tracer (0.2 nM in PBS/Tween (0.05%, v/v) to all tubes except the non-specific signal tube and vortex. Transfer 0.1 ml of each tube into a well of the abovementioned microtiter plate and incubate for 1 h at 37° C.\n\n \n \n \n \nMeasurement. After washing, 0.1 ml of avidin-labeled horse radish peroxidase (0.1 mcg/ml) in PBS containing 10 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin) is added. Incubate for 30 min at 37° C. After two additional washing steps with PBS (to remove all Tween detergent), 0.1 ml of freshly prepared TMB substrate (TMB substrate kit, Pierce) is added to each well. After 15 min incubation at room temperature the reaction is stopped by adding 0.1 ml of 2 N H\n2\nSO\n4\n, and the optical density is measured at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader.\n \nCalculation.\n        \n \nSubtract OD\n450 \nof the non-specific signal tube from all others\n \nDivide corrected OD\n450 \nof standards and unknowns by OD of total signal: A/A\n0 \n(%)=OD of unknown or standard×100%/OD of total signal\n \nMake logistic curve fit with standards and interpolate MGP values of unknown samples.\n\n\nE3. Procedure for the Sandwich ELISA (1)\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nIn this assay two antibodies directed to different epitopes of one antigen are used. One antibody is purified and bound to the solid phase of a 96-well microtiter plate and the antigen in a test solution is allowed to bind. Unbound proteins are removed by washing, and the labeled second antibody is allowed to bind to the antigen. After washing, the assay is quantified by measuring the amount of labeled second antibody that is bound to the matrix. The procedure described here is for antibodies mAb35-49 and mAb3-15, but is applicable for other antibodies as well.\n\n \n \n \n \nCoating of microtiter plates. mAb35-49 antibodies (5 mcg/ml in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, 0.1 ml per well) are immobilized in wells of a high binding 96-well microtiter plate (Corning #3590). After incubation for 1 h at 37° C. remaining active sites are blocked with blocking reagent (Roche, 0.125 ml for 1 h at room temperature). All subsequent washing steps between the various incubations are performed with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 in 0.225 ml PBS.\n \nSample preparation.\n        \n \n0.075 ml of unknown plasma are supplemented with 0.225 ml of wash buffer\n \nreference samples are prepared by diluting pooled plasma with wash buffer in concentrations of: 75%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, 1%, 0.5% and 0.1%.\n \nnon-specific signal tube: 0.3 ml of wash buffer\n \ntransfer 0.1 ml of each sample to microtiter plate wells, incubate 1 h at 37° C.\n \n\n\n \nMeasurement. After washing, 0.1 ml of second antibody solution (5 mcg/ml biotinylated mAb3-15) is added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37° C. After washing 0.1 ml of Vectastain™ ABC reagent (Vector laboratories) is added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 37° C. After two additional washing steps with PBS to remove all Tween detergent, 0.1 ml of freshly prepared TMB substrate (TMB substrate kit, Pierce) is added to each well. After 15 min incubation at room temperature the reaction is stopped by adding 0.1 ml of 2 N H\n2\nSO\n4\n, and the optical density is measured at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader.\n \nCalculation.\n        \n \nSubtract the average OD\n450 \nof the non-specific signal tube from all others\n \nMake logistic curve fit with standards and interpolate MGP values of unknown samples.\n\n\nE4. Procedure for the Sandwich ELISA (2)\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nFor the principle of this test, see the introduction under E3, above.\n\n \n \n \n \nMouse anti-MGP\n3-15 \n(1 μg/ml in 0.1 M Na-carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) was coupled to the microtiter plate by pipetting 50 μl of this solution per well, and incubating the plates for 1 h at 37° C.;\n \nRemaining active sites are blocked with blocking buffer (Roche Diagnostics Blocking reagent, cat nr. 1 112 589) 100 μl/well for 1 h at 37° C.;\n \nAfter repeated washing with washing buffer (0.3% (w/v) Tween-20 in phosphate-buffered saline) the plates are ready for use: either serum or purified MGP are pipetted in the well (50 μl), incubation for 60 min at 37° C.;\n \nNon-bound material is removed by washing with PBS-Tween buffer;\n \nThe second antibody (mouse anti-MGP\n54-84\n, conjugated with horse-radish peroxidase) is pipetted (50 μl, 1 μg/ml), and the plates are incubated for 60 min at 37° C.;\n \nAfter washing 3 times with PBS/Tween buffer the amount of antibody bound to the plate is quantified using TMB-staining (TMB enzymatic kit from Roche);\n \nAfter 10 min incubation the reaction is stopped by adding 1 M H\n2\nSO\n4 \nwhereafter the plate is read at 450 nm.\n\n\nF. Calibration Curve and Test Characteristics\n\n \n \n \n\n\nAn example of serum and plasma dilution curves obtained with the antibody capture ELISA is shown in \nFIG. 2\n. Calibration curves were made on 12 different days using six different dilutions of pooled reference serum. Each dilution was measured in duplicate, and the mean optical densities (OD) at 450 nm (SD) were expressed as a function of the serum concentration (\nFIG. 2\n). At increasing dilutions of the serum sample, more anti-MGP was bound to the plate, with the buffer value as a theoretical maximum. The lower detection limit was defined as the mean OD+three times the standard deviation of the buffer value, and amounted 2.096−3×0.089=1.829, corresponding with an MGP concentration of 8.5 U/L. The intra- and inter-assay variation of the test were determined using a four-fold dilution of the reference serum. The intra-assay variation was calculated by expressing the standard deviation as a percentage of the mean obtained from 21 replicates, repeated on three different days and amounted 5.4%. For assessment of the inter-assay variation, duplicate measurements were made on 14 consecutive days after which the standard deviation was expressed as a percentage of the means to give a value of 12.6%.\n\n\nIn later experiments a gradual improvement can be seen, i.e., the buffer values (no serum added) are somewhat higher, and the plateau values at high MGP concentrations are lower. This depends on factors such as staining time, etc.\n\n\nThe procedure for the antibody capture assay and for the competitive ELISA are similar for each of the monoclonal antibodies. A sandwich ELISA for full length MGP can be made by using one antibody against the N-terminus of MGP (mAb3-15) in combination with one antibody against the C-terminus (mAb61-79). A sandwich ELISA specifically detecting undercarboxylated species of MGP is constructed by using one antibody raised against a peptide outside the Gla-domain (for example, either mAb3-15, which has been produced by the inventor, or mAb61-79, which can be produced in accordance with the procedures described herein) in combination with one conformation-specific antibody (either mAb35-49[Glu] or mAb35-53[Glu]. A sandwich ELISA specifically detecting carboxylated species of MGP can be constructed by using one antibody raised against a peptide outside the Gla-domain (for example, either mAb3-15 or mAb61-79) in combination with one conformation-specific antibody (for example, either mAb35-49[Gla] or mAb35-53[Gla]).\n\n\nG. Validity of the Competitive ELISA Using Anti-MGP3-15\n\n\nEvidence for the validity of the test was obtained from its species specificity: whereas a good response was obtained with human serum, rat and mouse serum gave a poor response (\nFIG. 3\n). This must be due to the 2 amino acid residue difference between the rodent and human MGP sequence 3-15.\n\n\nSamples from five different volunteers were tested in duplicate, showing a good reproducibility and curves four of which were in the same range, whereas there was one outrider (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\nFor assessment of the normal range and reference groups, apparently healthy subjects were recruited among the Maastricht population. The ‘normal range’ for MGP was established in 80 apparently healthy men between 20 and 84 years of age. It was found that the mean value for serum MGP in this group was 96±17 U/L. Hence the normal range (defined as the mean±2 SD) was calculated to be between 62 and 130 U/L. No apparent age-dependence was observed for MGP in this group. Similar data were observed for elderly women (>60 years of age), but a larger range was found in women between 20-55 years. This may be related to hormonal changes, and forms the basis for our decision that women <60 years old were not included in the experiments presented here.\n\n\nThe day-to-day and within-day variations were determined in a group of 12 healthy men (20-35 years old), from whom blood was taken by venipuncture on nine time points of one day, and on 4 different days at 09.00 a.m. with one week intervals. The day-to-day and within-day variations were determined in a group of 12 healthy men (20-35 years old), from whom blood was taken by venipuncture on nine time points of one day, and on 4 different days at 09.00 a.m. with one week intervals. The within-day variation was calculated for each subject separately by expressing the standard deviation as a percentage of the mean of the nine time points, and amounted 11%. No distinct circadian pattern was observed. The day-to-day variation was calculated in a similar way from the four samples obtained with weekly intervals, and was found to be 8%.\n\n\nThe antibodies were tested further by incubating them with highly diluted peptide MGP3-15. Even at concentrations as low as 0.09 μg/ml the buffer value was almost completely blocked (\nFIG. 5\n).\n\n\nEach of the procedures described above can be used for validation of assays using different antibodies against human MGP.\n\n\nH. Sample Preparation\n\n\nTo further evaluate the robustness of the assay, we have checked the influence of variations in the sample preparation at the following steps: centrifugation speed (1,500 and 10,000×g) during serum preparation, centrifugation (10,000×g) after adding of mAb\n3-15\n, freeze-thawing of the serum sample (up to 8 cycles of freeze-thawing) and incubation time (between 3 and 60 minutes at room temperature) of the serum sample with mAb\n3-15\n. In none of these cases did the sample treatment measurably affect the observed MGP concentration.\n\n\nEach of the procedures described above can be used for validation of assays using different antibodies against human MGP.\n\n\nI. Assay Specificity\n\n\nThe mAb\n3-15 \nused in the assay was tested for its ability to differentiate between two recombinant bone Gla-proteins: osteocalcin and MGP (both as chimeric constructs linked with 6His-DHFR). Microtiter plates were coated with either purified recombinant MGP (1 μg/well) or equimolar amounts of purified recombinant osteocalcin. Coupling efficiency of both proteins was checked with anti-6-His antibodies. As is shown in \nFIG. 10\n, both plates contained similar amounts of recombinant protein (A: MGP; B: osteocalcin), and mAb\n3-15 \nreacted well with MGP, but not with osteocalcin. The species specificity of mAb\n3-15 \nwas tested further by comparing their reaction with human, rat, and murine serum. Cross reaction with rodent sera was below the detection limit (<8.5 U/L) in all dilutions tested.\n\n\nEach of the procedures described above can be used for validation of assays using different antibodies against human MGP.\n\n\nJ. Application and Potential Diagnostic Value of the MGP-assay\n\n\nJ1. Cardiovascular\n\n\nIn a group of over 500 non-hospitalized men between 40 and 60 years old the calcification of the abdominal aorta was measured by X-ray, and 28 subjects with severe calcifications were selected. Circulating MGP was significantly higher in those with calcifications than in those in an apparently healthy age- and sex-matched reference population (p<0.0001, see \nFIG. 6\n).\n\n\nJ2. Coronary Atherosclerosis\n\n\nPatients with coronary atherosclerosis (n=26) were recruited from the University Hospital, and their serum MGP was compared with that of the reference population. Serum MGP was significantly increased in the patient group (p<0.001, see \nFIG. 7\n).\n\n\nJ3. Diabetes Mellitus\n\n\nPatients with type I diabetes mellitus (n=23) were recruited from the University Hospital, and their serum MGP was compared with that of the reference population. Diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis. Serum MGP was significantly increased in the patient group (p<0.01, see \nFIG. 8\n). Patients were selected independent on the duration of the disease.\n\n\nJ4. Malignancies\n\n\nPatients with various malignancies (n=15) were recruited from the University Hospital, and their serum MGP was compared with that of the reference population. Serum MGP was substantially and significantly increased in the patient group (p<0.0001, see \nFIG. 9\n). Malignancies will often lead to angiogenesis (new formation of blood vessels).\n\n\nJ5. Other Diseases\n\n\nNo correlations were found with early signs of atherosclerosis (increased intima-media thickness) nor with various diseases not related to the cardiovascular system (see Table 1). This suggests that the newly developed assay is specific for diseases of the cardiovascular system, but many other patient groups have to be evaluated in this respect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSERUM MGP CONCENTRATIONS IN PATIENTS\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSerum MGP\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(% of age-and sex-matched\n \n \n \nCondition\n \nNumber\n \ncontrols)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHigh femur BMD (mean + > 1SD)\n \n40\n \n 98.5 ± 5.7\n \n \n \nLow femur BMD (mean − < 1SD)\n \n38\n \n102.0 ± 5.2\n \n \n \nSenile osteoporosis\n \n28\n \n101.8 ± 6.8\n \n \n \nIncreased intima/media thickness\n \n43\n \n 97.3 ± 6.1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nData are given ± SE.

Patients with osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis were obtained via various departments of the University Hospital Maastricht. MGP was measured using human MGP mAb\n3−15\n.\n \n \n \n \n \n\nJ6. Serum MGP in Health and Disease\n\n\n\nIn an analysis of cardiovascular patients, we found that two groups diabetics and non-diabetics) presenting with angina pectoris and selected for percutaneous angioplasty were characterized by remarkably low serum MGP concentrations. Surprisingly, normal MGP levels were observed in most subjects shortly after cerebrovascular accident and myocardial infarction. In patients with diseases of the cartilage, such as osteoarthritis and Bechterew's disease, the circulating MGP concentrations were also significantly below normal. Except in the Bechterew population, the mean age of all patient groups was slightly higher than that of the reference population; after adjustment for age the differences remained significant in all cases. Normal MGP values were observed in a number of other conditions including postmenopausal osteoporosis (T-score<-2.5). Very high MGP levels were found in renal dysfunction. This may be due to impaired renal filtration, because in these patients also other serum markers such as creatinin and osteocalcin were substantially increased (data not shown).\n\n\nWe observed that serum MGP was significantly decreased in subjects with angina pectoris, where angina pectoris patients exhibit circulating MGP levels that are 50% that of the normal population. In the group of diabetics all subjects presenting with chest pain were included in the study, whereas the non-diabetics consisted of subjects who underwent \npercutaneous angioplasty\n 6 months before blood sampling. These data are consistent with a recent publication in which an inverse correlation was observed between the extent of calcification in coronary artery disease and serum MGP concentrations. Remarkably, samples taken shortly after an acute cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident) were in the normal range. This apparently confusing result may be brought about by two opposite effects: subjects with low constitutive levels of MGP expression are at risk for developing arterial calcifications, but in and around the atherosclerotic lesions MGP expression is stimulated substantially.\n\n\nAt certain disease states the locally induced MGP production may compensate for the low synthesis in healthy tissue, resulting in apparently normal circulating MGP levels. So it seems that serum MGP can serve as a marker for cardiovascular risk assessment.\n\n\nIt is also clear that in diseases associated with cartilage destruction and calcification such as osteoarthritis and Bechterew's disease, serum MGP is low as well. The very high MGP levels found in patients with end-stage renal disease were probably the result of poor filtration rather than of high protein expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSerum MGP in health and disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMGP\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatients:\n\n\nnumber\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference population\n\n\n121\n\n\n11.2 ± 3.5\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCardiovascular diseases:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nangina pectoris in diabetics\n\n\n28\n\n\n 5.1 ± 1.2\n\n\n<0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nangina pectoris in non-diabetics\n\n\n151\n\n\n 6.2 ± 1.9\n\n\n<0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmyocardial infarction\n\n\n16\n\n\n11.5 ± 4.6\n\n\n0.82\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncerebrovascular accident\n\n\n47\n\n\n10.9 ± 4.1\n\n\n0.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiseases of the cartilage:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nosteoarthritis\n\n\n28\n\n\n 9.0 ± 2.8\n\n\n0.004\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchondropathy\n\n\n37\n\n\n 8.7 ± 2.3\n\n\n<0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBechterew's disease\n\n\n48\n\n\n 8.8 ± 2.4\n\n\n<0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther diseases:\n\n\n\n\n\n\npostmenopausal osteoporosis:\n\n\n72\n\n\n11.0 ± 4.6\n\n\n0.79\n\n\n\n\n\n\nend-stage renal dysfunction\n\n\n14\n\n\n18.2 ± 6.9\n\n\n0.013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegend: Reference samples were from an apparently healthy adult population.

In healthy arteries (1A-1B), a narrow intima is seen, with no visible calcium precipitations. MGP total antigen (stained with anti-MGP\n3-15\n) accumulates around the elastin fibers; undercarboxylated MGP (stained with anti-MGP\n35-53\n[Glu]) was not found at this stage, thus demonstrating that this vessel wall is sufficient in vitamin K. In \nstage\n 3 atherosclerosis (1C-1D), substantial intima thickening was observed with apparent vesicular accumulations of total MGP antigen. Similar patterns were found for under-carboxylated MGP, suggesting vitamin K-deficiency in these structures. In atherosclerosis stage 5b (calcium precipitates and bone formation) most of the total MGP antigen accumulated between the intimal tissue and calcified areas, and also here a substantial part was in the form of under-carboxylated MGP (1E-1F). Thus in all stages of atherosclerosis vitamin K-deficiency was demonstrated. This identifies atherosclerotic patients as a group who might benefit from vitamin K-supplements, which is of importance for public health and for the health food industry.\n\n\nHybridoma cell \nline B11A#\n1, which produces a monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope in human matrix Gla protein residues 35-49[Glu], was deposited on Mar. 23, 2004 with Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganizmen und Zelikulturen GmbH (DSMZ) located at Mascheroder Weg 1b, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany as accession number DSM ACC2639.
