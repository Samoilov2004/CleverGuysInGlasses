Description\n\n\n\n\n BACTERIAL ION CHANNEL AND A METHOD FOR SCREENING ION CHANNEL MODULATORS\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[001] The present invention is directed to a bacterial voltage-sensitive and ion- selective channel, the novel polypeptides of the channel and assays for screening for compounds that modulate activity of the channel.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[002] Voltage-gated potassium (K\nv\n), sodium (Na\nv\n), and calcium (Ca\nv\n) channels regulate the flow of ions into and out of cells and thereby support specialized higher order cell functions such as excitability, contraction, secretion, and synaptic transmission (7). Hundreds of K\nv\n, Na\nv\n and Ca\nv\n, channel proteins provide the tremendous functional diversity required for the complex behaviors of eukaryotic vertebrate and invertebrate cell-types (2, S). Ion channels are also widespread in prokaryotes but their gating and function are poorly understood because few have been functionally expressed in a system in which their properties can be studied.\n\n\n[003] Defects in the ion channels are responsible for a myriad of diseases including Long QT syndrome, which claims lives of about 4,000 children and young adults yearly in the United States alone. Ion channel blockers have been used to treat a number of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, angina, and atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation alone affects over 2.5 million people in the United States, with an estimated 160,000 new cases diagnosed each year, and an estimated annual cost of $1 billion. Thus, ligands or drugs that modulate ion channel activity may be useful in treating these diseases.\n\n\n[004] The primary structural theme of ion-selective channels is of a pore region surrounded by two transmembrane (2TM) segments. The first high resolution images of a bacterial 2TM tetrameric channel revealed the structural basis of K\n+\n ion \n\n selectivity encoded by the signature GY/FG sequence (4). In the primary structure of voltage-sensitive ion channels, an additional four transmembrane segments precede the pore-containing domain. The pore-forming subunits ((X\n1\n) of Na\nv\n and Ca\nv\n are composed of 4 homologous repeats of 6TM domains (3, 5). In theory, gene duplication of the 6TM K\nv\n or TRP channels provided the precise structural requirements for highly selective Na\n+\n and Ca\n2+\n channels. In particular, selectivity for Ca\n2+\n requires coordination of the Ca\n2+\n ions by four negatively charged glutamatic or aspartic acid residues lining the pore. The TRP class of ion channels are presumably tetramers of single 6TM subunits, but only a subset of these channels are moderately Ca\n2+\n selective (5).\n\n\n[005] Eukaryotic ion channels, due to their complexity, have not been successful candidates for screening for compounds that modulate their activity. Therefore, there exists a need for ion channels that can be used in screening for compounds that modulate their activity and therefore used in the search for ligands or drugs to treat various disorders and defects, including central nervous system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and cardiovascular disorders.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[006] We have discovered the first functionally expressed bacterial voltage- sensitive ion-selective channel. The novel channel can be used in conjunction with mammalian ion channel pore-containing regions in assays for screening for compounds that modulate activity of the channel. One bacterial ion channel of the present invention, called NaChBac, is derived from Bacillus halodurans (GenBank #BAB05220 (5)).\n\n\n[007] We have also discovered that homologous ion channels can be obtained from other organisms including, for example, Bacillus halodurans C- 125, Bacillus pseudofirmus 0 F4, Magnetococus MC-I, ThermobiÎ²dafusca (thermonasporafurca) and Paracoccus zeaxanthinifaciens.\n\n\n[008] The novel protein channels of the present invention are encoded by one 6 transmembrane segment. The pore region of the novel channel is homologous to \n\n that of voltage-gated calcium channels (7). The expressed channel is activated by voltage, and is blocked by calcium channel blockers. However, despite the resemblance to Ca\nv\n channels, the novel channel is selective for sodium. In accordance with the present invention, the novel Na channel of the invention can be converted to a Ca- selective channel using amino acid substitution in the pore domain {see, Example 2A).\n\n\n[009] Extremophile Bacillus Halodurans lives in extremely high salt (up to IM), highly alkaline (up to pH 11) conditions and therefore has a large Na\n+\n influx via the open channel. Na\n+\n drives the flagellar motor used by alkaphilic Bacillus Halodurans (24-27) and thus NaChBac channel is a good candidate for control of flagellar activity. However, the stimuli provoking depolarization are not known. The presence of NaChBac channel in bacteria allows growing large amounts of protein for structural studies. Structural studies of the protein would shed light on the important questions of Na\n4\nVCa\n+\n selectivity and voltage-dependent activation.\n\n\n[0010] NaChBac is able to form functional voltage-gated Na\n+\n selective channels. The ability of NaChBac to form such a channel has several advantages. First, Na\n+\n selectivity does not require the 4 domain repeat structure present in Na\nv\n channels. Proper orientation of the selectivity filter can presumably be made in a homotetramers of NaChBac. Second, the presence of glutamic and aspartic residues in the pore does not ensure Ca\n2+\n selectivity. Third, and as can already be concluded from our knowledge of Ca\nv\n and Na\nv\n sites for dihydropyridine and TTX block, pharmacologic sensitivity need not be correlated with channel selectivity.\n\n\n[0011] It has been determined that that Ca\nv\n channels require a flexible environment around the glutamate/aspartate residues to enable the channel filter to bind one Ca\n2+\n ion with high affinity or two with lower affinity (22). This flexibility may be provided by the similar but non-identical amino acids surrounding the glutamate/aspartate in the four repeats in the pore-forming Ci\n1\n subunit (23). Since all 4 repeats are presumably identical in a NaChBac tetramer, this flexibility is lost. Heterotetramers of NaChBac homologs might recreate this flexible environment to comprise Ca\n2+\n -selective channels, considerably increasing the diversity of this \n\n channel class. The simple NaChBac channel thus emphasizes the evolutionary utility of the 6TM building block.\n\n\n[0012] The present invention further includes novel ion channels using the screening assays to select anti-bacterial or probacterial agents.\n\n\n[0013] As used herein, the phrase \"ion channel\" refers to an entire channel that allows the movement of ions across a membrane, as well as to subunit polypeptide chains that comprise such a channel. Those of skill in the art will recognize that ion channels are made of subunits. As used herein, the term \"subunit\" refers to any component portion of an ion channel, including but not limited to the alpha subunit and other associated subunits.\n\n\n[0014] The term \"synthesized\" as used herein and understood in the art, refers to polynucleotides produced by purely chemical, as opposed to enzymatic, methods. \"Wholly\" synthesized DNA sequences are therefore produced entirely by chemical means, and \"partially\" synthesized DNAs embrace those wherein only portions of the resulting DNA were produced by chemical means.\n\n\n[0015] By the term \"region\" is meant a physically contiguous portion of the primary structure of a molecule. In the case of proteins, a region is defined by a contiguous portion of the amino acid sequence of that protein.\n\n\n[0016] The term \"domain\" is herein defined as referring to a structural part of a molecule that contributes to a known or suspected function of the molecule. Domains may be co-extensive with regions or portions thereof; domains may also incorporate a portion of a molecule that is distinct from a particular region, in addition to all or part of that region. Examples of ion channel domains include, but are not limited to, the extracellular (i.e., N-terminal), transmembrane and cytoplasmic (i.e., C-terminal) domains, which are co-extensive with like-named regions of ion channels; and each of the loop segments (both extracellular and intracellular loops) connecting adjacent transmembrane segments. \n\n [0017] As used herein, the term \"activity\" refers to a variety of measurable indicia suggesting or revealing binding, either direct or indirect; affecting a response, i.e., having a measurable affect in response to some exposure or stimulus, including, for example, the affinity of a compound for directly binding a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the invention. Activity can also be determined by measurement of downstream enzyme activities, and downstream messengers such as K\n+\n ions, C\n+\n ions, Na\n+\n ions, Cl\n\"\n ions, cyclic AMP, and phospholipids after some stimulus or event. For example, activity can be determined by measuring ion flux. As used herein, the term \"ion flux\" includes ion current. Activity can also be measured by measuring changes in membrane potential using electrodes or voltage-sensitive dyes, or by measuring neuronal or cellular activity such as action potential duration or frequency, the threshold for stimulating action potentials, long-term potentiation, or long-term inhibition.\n\n\n[0018] As used herein, the term \"protein\" is intended to include full length and partial fragments of a protein. The term \"protein\" may be used, herein, interchangeably with \"polypeptide.\" Thus, as used herein, the term \"protein\" includes polypeptide, peptide, oligopeptide, or amino acid sequence.\n\n\n[0019] As used herein, the term \"antibody\" is meant to refer to complete, intact antibodies, and fragments thereof. Complete, intact antibodies include monoclonal antibodies such as murine monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, and recombinant antibodies identified using phage display.\n\n\n[0020] As used herein, the term \"binding\" means the physical or chemical interaction between two proteins, compounds or molecules (including nucleic acids, such as DNA or RNA), or combinations thereof. Binding includes ionic, non-ionic, hydrogen bonds, Vander Waals, hydrophobic interactions, etc. The physical interaction, the binding, can be either direct or indirect, indirect being through or due to the effects of another protein, compound or molecule. Direct binding refers to interactions that do not take place through or due to the effect of another protein, compound or molecule, but instead are without other substantial chemical intermediates. Binding may be detected in many different manners. As a non- \n\n limiting example, the physical binding interaction between an ion channel of the invention and a compound can be detected using a labeled compound. Alternatively, functional evidence of binding can be detected using, for example, a cell transfected with and expressing an ion channel of the invention. Binding of the transfected cell to a ligand of the ion channel that was transfected into the cell provides functional evidence of binding. Other methods of detecting binding are well known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n[0021] As used herein, the term \"compound\" means any identifiable chemical or molecule, including, but not limited to a small molecule, peptide, protein, sugar, nucleotide, or nucleic acid. Such compound can be natural or synthetic.\n\n\n[0022] As used herein, the term \"complementary\" refers to Watson-Crick base- pairing between nucleotide units of a nucleic acid molecule.\n\n\n[0023] As used herein, the term \"contacting\" means bringing together, either directly or indirectly, a compound into physical proximity to a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the invention. The polypeptide or polynucleotide can be present in any number of buffers, salts, solutions, etc. Contacting includes, for example, placing the compound into a beaker, microtiter plate, cell culture flask, or a microarray, such as a gene chip, or the like, which contains either the ion channel polypeptide or fragment thereof, or nucleic acid molecule encoding an ion channel or fragment thereof.\n\n\n[0024] As used herein, the phrase \"homologous nucleotide sequence,\" or \"homologous amino acid sequence,\" or variations thereof, refers to sequences characterized by a homology, at the nucleotide level or amino acid level, of at least about 50%, more preferably at least about 60%, more preferably at least about 70- 80%, more preferably at least about 90%, and most preferably at least about 95% to the entirety of SEQ ID NO: 1 to SEQ ID NO: 5, or to at least a portion of SEQ ID NO: 1 to SEQ ID NO: 5, which portion encodes a functional domain of the encoded polypeptide. As noted above, homologous nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences can be obtained from at least the following organisms: Bacillus halodurans C-125, \n\n Bacillus pseudofirmus 0 F4, Magnetococus MC-I, Thermobifidafusca (thermonasporafurcÎ¬) and Paracoccus zeaxanthinifaciens.\n\n\n[0025] Homologous amino acid sequences include those amino acid sequences which contain conservative amino acid substitutions, as well as polypeptides having ion channel activity.\n\n\n[0026] A homologous amino acid sequence does not, however, include the sequence of known polypeptides having ion channel activity. Percent homology can be determined by, for example, the Gap program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, Madison WI), which uses the algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Adv. Appl. Math., 1981, 2:482-489, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) using the default settings.\n\n\n[0027] As used herein, the term \"isolated\" nucleic acid molecule refers to a nucleic acid molecule (DNA or RNA) that has been removed from its native environment. Examples of isolated nucleic acid molecules include, but are not limited to, recombinant DNA molecules contained in a vector, recombinant DNA molecules maintained in a heterologous host cell, partially or substantially purified nucleic acid molecules, and synthetic DNA or RNA molecules.\n\n\n[0028] As used herein, the terms \"modulates\" or \"modifies\" means an increase or decrease in the amount, quality, or effect of a particular activity or protein.\n\n\n[0029] The term \"preventing\" refers to decreasing the probability that an organism contracts or develops an abnormal condition.\n\n\n[0030] The term \"abnormal condition\" refers to a function in the cells or tissues of an organism that deviates from their normal functions in that organism. An abnormal condition can relate to cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell signaling, or cell survival. Abnormal cell proliferative conditions include cancers such as fibrotic and mesangial disorders, abnormal angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, wound healing, psoriasis, diabetes mellitus, and inflammation. Abnormal differentiation \n\n conditions include, but are not limited to, neurodegenerative disorders, slow wound healing rates, and slow tissue grafting healing rates. Abnormal cell signaling conditions include, but are not limited to, psychiatric disorders involving excess neurotransmitter activity. Abnormal cell survival conditions may also relate to conditions in which programmed cell death (apoptosis) pathways are activated or abrogated. A number of protein kinases are associated with the apoptosis pathways. Aberrations in the function of any one of the protein kinases could lead to cell immortality or premature cell death.\n\n\n[0031] By \"amplification\" it is meant increased numbers of DNA or RNA in a cell compared with normal cells. \"Amplification\" as it refers to RNA can be the detectable presence of RNA in cells, since in some normal cells there is no basal expression of RNA. In other normal cells, a basal level of expression exists, therefore, in these cases amplification is the detection of at least 1 to 2-fold, and preferably more, compared to the basal level.\n\n\n[0032] As used herein, the term \"oligonucleotide\" refers to a series of linked nucleotide residues which has a sufficient number of bases to be used in a polymerase chain reaction(PCR). This short sequence is based on (or designed from) a genomic or cDNA sequence and is used to amplify, confirm, or reveal the presence of an identical, similar or complementary DNA or RNA in a particular cell or tissue. Oligonucleotides comprise portions of a nucleic acid sequence having at least about 10 nucleotides and as many as about 50 nucleotides, preferably about 15 to 30 nucleotides. They are chemically synthesized and may be used as probes.\n\n\n[0033] As used herein, the term \"probe\" refers to nucleic acid sequences of variable length, preferably between at least about 10 and as many as about 6,000 nucleotides, depending on use. They are used in the detection of identical, similar, or complementary nucleic acid sequences. Longer length probes are usually obtained from a natural or recombinant source, are highly specific and much slower to hybridize than oligomers. They may be single- or double-stranded and are carefully designed to have specificity in PCR, hybridization membrane-based, or ELIS A-like technologies. \n\n [0034] As used herein, the phrase \"stringent hybridization conditions\" or \"stringent conditions\" refers to conditions under which a probe, primer, or oligonucleotide will hybridize to its target sequence, but to a minimal number of other sequences. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences will hybridize with specificity to their proper complements at higher temperatures. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5Â°C lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength, pH and nucleic acid concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to the target sequence hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium. Since the target sequences are generally present in excess, at Tm, 50% of the probes are hybridized to their complements at equilibrium.\n\n\n[0035] Typically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M sodium ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M sodium ion (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30Â°C for short probes, primers or oligonucleotides (e.g., 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60Â° C for longer probes, primers or oligonucleotides. Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents, such as formamide.\n\n\n[0036] The amino acid sequences are presented in the ammo (N) to carboxy (C) direction, from left to right. The N-terminal a-amino group and the C-terminal P- carboxy groups are not depicted in the sequence. The nucleotide sequences are presented by single strands only, in the 5' to 3' direction, from left to right. Nucleotides and amino acids are represented in the manner recommended by the IUPAC Biochemical Nomenclature Commission.\n\n\n[0037] The present invention, in one aspect, provides a purified and isolated bacterial voltage-sensitive ion-selective channel containing a 6 transmembrane domain. The invention further provides a purified and isolated bacterial voltage- sensitive ion-selective channel having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a homologous sequence, or a fragment thereof capable of forming an ion-channel pore. The ion-channel pore has an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID \n\n NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, or a homologous sequence, or a fragment thereof.\n\n\n[0038] The term \"fragment\" when referring to the NaChBac channel protein means proteins or polypeptides which retain essentially the same biological function or activity as the protein of SEQ ID NO:1 and more specifically, as the pore region of SEQ ID NO:2 -5. For example, the NaChBac channel fragments of the present invention maintain at least about 50% of the activity of the protein of SEQ ID NO:1, preferably at least 75%, more preferably at least about 95% of the activity of the protein of SEQ ID NO:1, as determined e.g., by a standard activity assay such as the clamp assay or inside-out-patch disclosed in Example 1 which follows and includes measuring activity of the channel Ï\nact\n = 10 Â± 3.5 ms and Ïj\nÏact\n = 203 Â± 43 ms.\n\n\n[0039] A channel fragment of the invention may be (i) a peptide in which one or more of the amino acid residues are substituted with a conserved or non-conserved amino acid residue (preferably a conserved amino acid residue) and such substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code, or (ii) a peptide hi which one or more of the amino acid residues includes a substituent group, or (iii) a peptide in which the protein is fused with another compound, such as a compound to increase the half-life of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol). Thus, a channel fragment can include a proprotein which can be activated by cleavage of the proprotein portion to produce an active polypeptide.\n\n\n[0040] The protein fragments of the invention are of a sufficient length to uniquely identify a region of the channel pore. Preferred channel pore fragments of the invention include those that have at least about 50 % homology (sequence identity) to the protein of SEQ ID NO:2, more preferably at least about 60 % or more homology, more preferably at least about 70 - 80 % or more homology to the protein of SEQ ID NO. '2, still more preferably at least about 80 - 90 % or more homology to the protein of SEQ ID NO:2.\n\n\n[0041 ] The channel of the present invention and fragments thereof are \"isolated\", meaning the protein or peptide constitutes at least about 70%, preferably at least about 85%, more preferably at least about 90% and still more preferably at \n\n least about 95% by weight of the total protein in a given sample. The channel fragments may be present in a free state or bound to other components, e.g. blocking groups to chemically insulate reactive groups (e.g. amines, carboxyls, etc.) of the peptide, or fusion peptides or polypeptides (i.e. the peptide may be present as a portion of a larger polypeptide).\n\n\n[0042] The channel of the present invention has a number of functional domains, e.g., 6 transmembrane domains (as illustrated in Figure IA) Sl, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6 and a pore domain region. Accordingly, preferred channel fragments are the pore region (SEQ ID NO: 2), a segment containing the pore region and S6 domain (SEQ ID NO: 3), the pore region and S5 domain (SEQ ID NO: 4), and a segment containing the pore region, S5 and S6 domains (SEQ ID NO: 5).\n\n\n[0043] Thus, a NaChBac protein or nucleic acid fragment can be employed that contains only specific domains and can be used to screen for compounds that modulate the channel activity in targeted cells as desired or to screen for compounds that have anti-bacterial or probacterial activity.\n\n\n[0044] In another aspect, the invention additionally provides an isolated nucleic acid encoding a purified and isolated bacterial voltage-sensitive ion-selective channel containing a 6 transmembrane domain. According to the present invention, the channel nucleotide sequences disclosed herein may be used to identify homologs of the channel in other species, including but not limited to humans, mammals, and invertebrates. Any of the nucleotide sequences disclosed herein, or any portion thereof, can be used, for example, as probes to screen databases or nucleic acid libraries, such as, for example, genomic or cDNA libraries, to identify homologs, using screening procedures well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n[0045] Accordingly, homologs having at least 50%, more preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, and most preferably at least 100% homology with the channel sequences can be identified. The disclosure herein of polynucleotides encoding channel polypeptides makes readily available to one of ordinary skill in the art many possible fragments of the ion channel polynucleotide. \n\n roiynucieotiÎ±e sequences provided herein may encode, as non-limiting examples, a native channel, a constitutive active channel, or a dominant-negative channel.\n\n\n[0046] With the knowledge of the nucleotide sequence information disclosed in the present invention, one skilled in the art can identify and obtain nucleotide sequences which encode the channel from different sources (i.e., different tissues or different organisms) through a variety of means well known to the skilled artisan and as disclosed by, for example, Sambrook et al., Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual, 3\nrd\n ed., Cold Spring Harbor Press, NY (2000), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. For example, as noted above, the inventors have discovered homologs in, for example, the following organisms: Bacillus halodurans C-125, Bacillus pseudofirmus 0 F4, Magnetococus MC-I, Thermobifidafusca (thermonaspora fared) and Paracoccus zeaxanthinifaciens.\n\n\n[0047] A nucleic acid molecule comprising any of the channel nucleotide sequences described above can alternatively be synthesized by use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure, with the PCR oligonucleotide primers produced from the nucleotide sequences provided herein. See U.S. Patent Numbers 4,683,195 and 4,683,202. The PCR reaction provides a method for selectively increasing the concentration of a particular nucleic acid sequence even when that sequence has not been previously purified and is present only in a single copy in a particular sample. The method can be used to amplify either single- or double-stranded DNA. The essence of the method involves the use of two oligonucleotide probes to serve as primers for the template-dependent, polymerase mediated replication of a desired nucleic acid molecule.\n\n\n[0048] A wide variety of alternative cloning and in vitro amplification methodologies are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples of these techniques are found in, for example, Berger et al., Guide to Molecular Cloning Techniques, Methods in Enzymology 152, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA (Berger), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n[0049] Automated sequencing methods can be used to obtain or verify the nucleotide sequence of the channel. Nucleotide sequences determined by \n\n automation may contain some errors and are typically at least about 90%, more typically at least about 95% to at least about 99.9% identical to the actual nucleotide sequence of a given nucleic acid molecule.\n\n\n[0050] The invention also provides a fusion protein comprising the bacterial ion-channel, which ion channel preferably has an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, or a homolog, or a fragment thereof and a mammalian ion-channel pore-containing region. The fusion protein is expressed on the outer surface of a host cell such that the host cells displays the ion channel protein on its surface. The invention further contemplates an isolated nucleic acid encoding the fusion protein.\n\n\n[0051] The present invention also provides host cells transformed with the nucleic acid encoding a purified and isolated bacterial voltage-sensitive ion-selective channel containing a 6 transmembrane domain or a fusion protein. Thus, host cells, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, comprising a polynucleotide of the invention in a manner that permits expression of the encoded channel polypeptide are provided. Polynucleotides of the invention may be introduced into the host cell as part of a circular plasmid, or as linear DNA comprising an isolated protein coding region or a viral vector.\n\n\n[0052] Methods for introducing DNA into the host cell that are well known and routinely practiced in the art include transformation, transfection, electroporation, nuclear injection, or fusion with carriers such as liposomes, micelles, ghost cells, and protoplasts. Expression systems of the invention include bacterial, yeast, fungal, plant, insect, invertebrate, vertebrate, and mammalian cells systems.\n\n\n[0053] The invention provides host cells that are transformed or transfected (stably or transiently) with the fusion protein comprising the ion-channel of the invention and a mammalian ion-channel pore-containing region or with ion-channel alone. Such host cells are useful for amplifying the polynucleotides and also for expressing the channel polypeptide or fragment thereof encoded by the polynucleotide. In still another related embodiment, the invention provides a method for producing a channel polypeptide (or fragment thereof) comprising the steps of \n\n growing a host cell of the invention in a nutrient medium and isolating the polypeptide or variant thereof from the cell or the medium. Because the channel is a membrane spanning channel, it will be appreciated that, for some applications, such as certain activity assays, the preferable isolation may involve isolation of cell membranes containing the polypeptide embedded therein, whereas for other applications a more complete isolation may be preferable.\n\n\n[0054] The invention also provides a system for screening ion-channel agonists or antagonists. The system includes a host cell comprising a nucleic acid encoding a fusion protein having a purified and isolated bacterial voltage-sensitive ion-selective channel having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, a homolog, or a fragment thereof capable of forming an ion-channel pore and a mammalian ion channel pore- containing region.\n\n\n[0055] The present invention also provides a method of identifying a modulator of biological activity of an ion channel. The bacterial ion channel of the present invention is used for the high level expression of mammalian ion-channel pore domains in mammalian or bacterial cells. The expressed mammalian ion channel pore domains screened for activation or blockage by test compounds. The bacterial channel protein of the present invention represents a minimal length structure that is highly expressed in mammalian cells. The apparent lack of its interaction with other proteins is an advantage in that complications arising from multimeric protein formation are avoided. Regions of known mammalian channel domains can be inserted into this minimal structure and tested as targets for peptides or small molecules. Thus, the method of identifying a modulator involves expressing in a host cell a fusion protein comprising a mammalian ion-channel pore-containing region and a bacterial voltage-sensitive ion-selective channel having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, a homolog, or a fragment thereof capable of forming an ion-channel pore; contacting the host cell with a candidate modulator; and measuring the effect of the modulator on the ion-channel activity. Preferably, the pore region of SEQ ID NO: 1 is substituted with a mammalian ion-channel pore-containing region. The ion channel activity can be measured by various assays including high throughput screening assays, electrophysiological assays (e.g., patch clamp and patch clamp arrays), fluorescence changes (e.g., voltage-sensitive dyes and calcium- \n\n sensitive dyes), contractile behavior, secretion, and various binding assays (e.g., ion flux assay, a membrane potential assay, a yeast growth assay, a cAMP assay, an inositol triphosphate assay, a diacylglycerol assay, an Aequorin assay, a Luciferase assay, a FLIPR assay for intracellular Ca\n2+\n concentration, a mitogenesis assay, a MAP Kinase activity assay, an arachidonic acid release assay, and an assay for extracellular acidification rates, etc.). The modulator can be an antagonist or an agonist. The invention further contemplates a modulator discovered by screening candidate modulators using the above method.\n\n\n[0056] Compounds that stimulate the channel's activity are useful as agonists in disease states or conditions characterized by insufficient channel signaling (e.g., as a result of insufficient activity of the channel ligand). The modulators that block ligand-mediated channel signaling are useful as the channel antagonists to treat disease states or conditions characterized by excessive channel signaling. In addition channel modulators in general, as well as channel polynucleotides and polypeptides, are useful in diagnostic assays for such diseases or conditions.\n\n\n[0057] Agents that modulate (i.e., increase, decrease, or block) channel activity or expression may be identified by incubating a putative modulator with a cell containing a channel polypeptide or polynucleotide and determining the effect of the putative modulator on the channel activity or expression. The selectivity of a compound that modulates the activity of the channel can be evaluated by comparing its effects on the channel to its effect on other ion channel compounds. Selective modulators may include, for example, antibodies and other proteins, peptides, or organic molecules that specifically bind to the ion channel polypeptide or anion- channel encoding nucleic acid. Modulators of the channel activity will be therapeutically useful in treatment of diseases and physiological conditions in which normal or aberrant ion-channel activity is involved. Compounds identified as modulating channel activity may be further tested in other assays including, but not limited to, in vivo models, in order to confirm or quantitate their activity. The channel polynucleotides and polypeptides, as well as the channel modulators, may also be used in diagnostic assays for numerous diseases or conditions, including metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory diseases, hormonal disorders, and various neurological disorders. \n\n [0058] The invention also comprehends high-throughput screening (HTS) assays to identify compounds that interact with or inhibit biological activity (i.e., affect enzymatic activity, binding activity, etc.) of the channel polypeptide. HTS assays permit screening of large numbers of compounds in an efficient manner. Cell-based HTS systems are contemplated to investigate the channel's receptor- ligand interaction. HTS assays are designed to identify \"hits\" or \"lead compounds\" having the desired property, from which modifications can be designed to improve the desired property. Chemical modification of the \"hit\" or \"lead compound\" is often based on an identifiable structure/activity relationship between the \"hit\" and the channel polypeptide.\n\n\n[0059] One of skill in the art can, for example, measure the activity of the ion channel polypeptide using electrophysiological methods, described infra. Where the activity of the sample containing the test compound is higher than the activity in the sample lacking the test compound, the compound will have increased activity. Similarly, where the activity of the sample containing the test compound is lower than the activity in the sample lacking the test compound, the compound will have inhibited activity.\n\n\n[0060] The activity of the polypeptides of the invention can also be determined by, as non-limiting examples, the ability to bind or be activated by certain ligands, including, but not limited to, known neurotransmitters, agonists and antagonists, including but not limited to serotonin, acetylcholine, nicotine, and GABA. Alternatively, the activity of the ion channel can be assayed by examining activity such as ability to bind or be affected by sodium and calcium ions, hormones, chemokines, neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, nucleotides, lipids, odorants, and photons. In various embodiments of the method, the assay may take the form of an ion flux assay, a membrane potential assay, a yeast growth assay, a cAMP assay, an inositol triphosphate assay, a diacylglycerol assay, an Aequorin assay, a Luciferase assay, a FLIPR assay for intracellular Ca\n2+\n concentration, a mitogenesis assay, a MAP Kinase activity assay, an arachidonic acid release assay (e.g., using [\n3\nH]- arachidonic acid), and an assay for extracellular acidification rates, as well as other binding or function-based assays of activity that are generally known in the art. \n\n [0061] Another potentially useful assay to examine the activity of ion channels is electrophysiology (e.g., patch clamp, patch clamp arrays, or contractile behavior), the measurement of ion permeability across the cell membrane. This technique is described in, for example, Electrophysiology, A Practical Approach, D.I. Wallis editor, IRL Press at Oxford University Press, (1993), and Voltage and Patch Clamping with Microelectrodes, Smith et aL, eds., Waverly Press, Inc for the American Physiology Society (1985), each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n[0062] Another assay to examine the activity of ion channels is through the use of the FLIPR Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader system, developed by Dr. Vince Groppi of the Pharmacia Corporation to perform cell-based, high-throughput screening (HTS) assays measuring, for example, membrane potential. Changes in plasma membrane potential correlate with the modulation of ion channels as ions move into or out of the cell. The FLIPR system measures such changes in membrane potential. This is accomplished by loading cells expressing an ion channel gene with a cell-membrane permeant fluorescent indicator dye suitable for measuring changes in membrane potential such as diBAC (bis-(l,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) pentamethine oxonol, Molecular Probes). Thus the modulation of ion channel activity can be assessed with FLIPR and detected as changes in the emission spectrum of the diBAC dye.\n\n\n[0063] The present invention is particularly useful for screening compounds by using the channel in any of a variety of drug screening techniques. The compounds to be screened include (which may include compounds which are suspected to modulate the channel activity), but are not limited to, extracellular, intracellular, biologic or chemical origin. The channel polypeptide employed in such a test may be in any form, preferably, free in solution, attached to a solid support, borne on a cell surface or located intracellularly. One skilled in the art can, for example, measure the formation of complexes between ion-x and the compound being tested. Alternatively, one skilled in the art can examine the diminution in complex formation between the channel and its substrate caused by the compound being tested. \n\n [0064] The activity of the channel polypeptides of the invention can be determined by, for example, examining the ability to bind or be activated by chemically synthesized peptide ligands. Alternatively, the activity of the channel polypeptides can be assayed by examining their ability to bind calcium ions, hormones, chemokines, neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, nucleotides, lipids, odorants, and photons. Alternatively, the activity of the channel polypeptides can be determined by examining the activity of effector molecules including, but not limited to, adenylate cyclase, phospholipases and ion channels. Thus, modulators of the channel polypeptide activity may alter ion channel function, such as a binding property of a channel or an activity such as ion selectivity. The channel activity can be determined by methodologies that are used to assay for FaRP activity, which is well known to those skilled in the art. Biological activities of ion-x receptors according to the invention include, but are not limited to, the binding of a natural or an unnatural ligand, as well as any one of the functional activities of ion channels known in the art.\n\n\n[0065] The modulators of the invention exhibit a variety of chemical structures, which can be generally grouped into non-peptide mimetics of natural ion channel ligands, peptide and non-peptide allosteric effectors of ion channels, and peptides that may function as activators or inhibitors (competitive, uncompetitive and noncompetitive) (e.g., antibody products) of ion channels. The invention does not restrict the sources for suitable modulators, which may be obtained from natural sources such as plant, animal or mineral extracts, or non-natural sources such as small molecule libraries, including the products of combinatorial chemical approaches to library construction, and peptide libraries.\n\n\n[0066] Examples of organic modulators of ion channels are GAIBA, serotonin, acetylcholine, nicotine, glutamate, glycine, NMDA, and kainic acid.\n\n\n[0067] Other assays can be used to examine enzymatic activity including, but not limited to, photometric, radiometric, HPLC, electrochemical, and the like, which are described in, for example, Enzyme Assays: A Practical Approach, eds., R. Eisenthal and M. J. Danson, 1992, Oxford University Press, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \n\n [0068] A variety of heterologous systems are available for functional expression of recombinant receptors that are well known to those skilled in the art. Such systems include bacteria (Strosberg, et al., Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 1992,13, 95-98),yeast (Pausch, Trends in Biotechnology, 1997, 15, 487-494), several kinds of insect cells (Vanden Broeck, Int. Rev. Cytology, 1996, 164, 189-268), amphibian cells (Jayawickremeet al., Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 1997, 8, 629-634) and several mammalian cell lines (CHO, HEK-293, COS, etc.; see Gerhardt, et al., Eur. J Pharmacology, 1997, 334,1-23). These examples do not preclude the use of other possible cell expression systems, including cell lines obtained from nematodes (PCT application WO 98/37177).\n\n\n[0069] In preferred embodiments of the invention, methods of screening for compounds that modulate the channel activity comprise contacting test compounds with the channel and assaying for the presence of a complex between the compound and an ion. In such assays, the ligand is typically labeled. After suitable incubation, free ligand is separated from that present in bound form, and the amount of free or uncomplexed label is a measure of the ability of the particular compound to bind to ion-x. Examples of such biological responses include, but are not limited to, the following: the ability to survive in the absence of a limiting nutrient in specifically engineered yeast cells (Pausch, Trends in Biotechnology, 1997, 15, 487-494); changes in intracellular Ca\n2+\n concentration as measured by fluorescent dyes (Murphy, et al., Cur. Opinion Drug Disc. Dev., 1998, 1, 192-199). Fluorescence changes can also be used to monitor ligand-induced changes in membrane potential or intracellular pH; an automated system suitable for HTS has been described for these purposes (Schroeder, et al., J. Biomolecular Screening, 1996,1, 75-80). Melanophores prepared from Xenopus laevis how a ligand-dependent change in pigment organization in response to heterologous ion channel activation; this response is adaptable to HTS formats (Jayawickreme et al., Cur. Opinion Biotechnology, 1997, 8, 629-634). Assays are also available for the measurement of common second messengers, including cAMP, phosphoinositides and arachidonic acid, but these are not generally preferred for HTS.\n\n\n[0070] In another embodiment of the invention, the bacterial ion channel is used in assays to select compounds that have antibacterial or probacterial activity. For \n\n example, a method of identifying a modulator of biological activity of abacterial ion channel, said method comprising the steps of:\n\n\na) expressing in a host cell a bacterial voltage-sensitive ion-selective channel having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a homolog thereof, or a fragment thereof capable of forming an ion- channel pore;\n\n\nb) contacting said host cell with a candidate modulator; and c) measuring the effect of the modulator on the ion-channel activity.\n\n\n[0071 ] Candidate modulators contemplated by the invention include compounds selected from libraries of either potential activators or potential inhibitors. There are a number of different libraries used for the identification of small molecule modulators, including: (1) chemical libraries, (2) natural product libraries, and (3) combinatorial libraries comprised of random peptides, oligonucleotides or organic molecules.\n\n\n[0072] Chemical libraries consist of random chemical structures, some of which are analogs of known compounds or analogs of compounds that have been identified as \"hits\" or \"leads\" in other drug discovery screens, some of which are derived from natural products, and some of which arise from non-directed synthetic organic chemistry.\n\n\n[0073] Natural product libraries are collections of microorganisms, animals, plants, or marine organisms that are used to create mixtures for screening by: (1) fermentation and extraction of broths from soil, plant or marine microorganisms or (2) extraction of plants or marine organisms. Natural product libraries include polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides, and variants (non-naturally occurring) thereof. For a review, see Science 282:63-68 (1998).\n\n\n[0074] Combinatorial libraries are composed of large numbers of peptides, oligonucleotides, or organic compounds as a mixture. These libraries are relatively easy to prepare by traditional automated synthesis methods, PCR, cloning, or proprietary synthetic methods. Of particular interest are -non-peptide combinatorial \n\n libraries. Still other libraries of interest include peptide, protein, peptidomimetic, multiparallel synthetic collection, recombinatorial, polypeptide, antibody, and RNAi libraries. For a review of combinatorial chemistry and libraries created therefrom, see Myers, Curt: Opin. Biotechnol. 8:701-707 (1997). Identification of modulators through use of the various libraries described herein permits modification of the candidate \"hit\" (or \"lead\") to optimize the capacity of the \"hit\" to modulate activity.\n\n\n[0075] The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a modulator obtained using the present invention. Preferred compositions comprise, in addition to the modulator, a pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., sterile and non-toxic) liquid, semisolid, or solid diluent that serves as a pharmaceutical vehicle, excipient, or medium. Any diluent known in the art may be used. Exemplary diluents include, but are not limited to, water, saline solutions, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate, magnesium stearate, methyl- and propylhydroxybenzoate, talc, alginates, starches, lactose, sucrose, dextrose, sorbitol, mannitol, glycerol, calcium phosphate, mineral oil, and cocoa butter. Suitable carriers or diluents are described in the most recent edition of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16\nth\n ed., Osol, A. (ed.), 1980, a standard reference text in this field, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Preferred examples of such carriers or diluents include, but are not limited to, water, saline, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, and 5% human serum albumin. Liposomes and nonaqueous vehicles such as fixed oils may also be used. The formulations are sterilized by commonly used techniques.\n\n\n[0076] The compositions, or pharmaceutical compositions, comprising the nucleic acid molecules, vectors, polypeptides, antibodies and compounds identified by the screening methods described herein, can be prepared for any route of administration including, but not limited to, oral, intravenous, cutaneous, subcutaneous, nasal, intramuscular or intraperitoneal. The nature of the carrier or other ingredients will depend on the specific route of administration and particular embodiment of the invention to be administered. Examples of techniques and protocols that are useful in this context are, inter alia, found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16\nth\n ed., Osol, A. (ed.), 1980, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \n\n [0077] The dosage of these compounds will depend on the disease state or condition to be treated and other clinical factors such as weight and condition of the human or animal and the route of administration of the compound. For treating human or animals, between approximately 0.5 mg/kg of body weight to 500 mg/kg of body weight of the compound can be administered. Therapy is typically administered at lower dosages and is continued until the desired therapeutic outcome is observed.\n\n\n[0078] Additionally, the bacterial voltage-sensitive ion-selective channel of the present invention can as a backbone for delivery of ion channels of various kinds to tissues. For example, a vector can be used to deliver and overexpress a K channel in a region of epilpsy in brain, or to control insulin secretion from pancreas, to stabilize or prevent cardiac arrhythmias, or to prevent chronic pain by targeting to pain fibers of spinal cord. This could of course be done with a K channel, but the present invention, given its minimal structure, provides an advantage. In an additional embodiments, residues could be engineered into the bacterial ion channel, e.g., NaChBac, so that it was activated by a unique ligand (a unique small molecule that one could take as a drug, thus activating only the designer channel.).\n\n\n[0079] The term \"vector\" as used herein in the context of biological gene therapy means a carrier that can contain or associate with specific polynucleotide sequences and which functions to transport the specific polynucleotide sequences into a cell. The transfected cells may be cells derived from the patient's normal tissue, the patient's diseased tissue, or may be non-patient cells. Examples of vectors include plasmids and infective microorganisms such as viruses, or non-viral vectors such as the ligand-DNA conjugates, liposomes, and lipid-DNA complexes discussed above.\n\n\n[0080] Viral vector systems which may be utilized in the present invention include, but are not limited to, (a) adenovirus vectors; (b) retrovirus vectors; (c) adeno- associated virus vectors; (d) herpes simplex virus vectors; (e) SV 40 vectors; (f) polyoma virus vectors; (g) papilloma virus vectors; (h) picornavirus vectors; (i) vaccinia virus vectors; and (j) a helper-dependent or gutless adenovirus. In the preferred embodiment the vector is an adenovirus. \n\n BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n[0081] The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the objects, advantages, and principles of the invention. In the drawings, Figures 1 A-ID depict the primary structure and characteristics of NaChBac. Figure IA is a deduced amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) of NaChBa. The putative 6 transmembrane domains (S1-S6) and the pore region are indicated. The positively charged residences in the S4 region are indicated in bold. Figure IB shows control in lane 1 and an inducible His-tagged NaChBac protein expressed in bacteria and detected by Western Blot with anti-His antibody in lane 2. Figure 1C is a hydropathy plot of NaChBac 6 transmembrane domains (1-6) and a pore region (P). Figure ID illustrates alignment of the Putative pore region of NaChBac with that of CatSper and the four domains (I, II, III, IV) from representative voltage-gated Ca\n2+\n (Ca\nv\nl-3) and Na\n+\n (Na\nv\nl.l, Na\nv\n1.8) channels. GenBank accession numbers for sequences used in the alignment are AF407332 (CatSper), X15539 (CaJ -2) , M94172 (Ca\nv\n2.2), 054898 (Ca\nv\n3-1). X03638(Na\nv\nl-l) and X92184 (Na\nv\nl-8).\n\n\n[0082] Figures 2A-2D illustrate activation and inactivation of NaChBac expressed in CHO-Kl cells. Upper row is that of voltage -clamp protocols. Middle row is that of representative traces. Lower row is that of averaged peak current voltage (UV) relation. Figure 2A shows l\nNaChBao\n (upper) and an averaged peak current-voltage (W) relation (lower). Currents were normalized to cell capacitance (9.0 Â± 0.3 pF; n = 18). Figure 2B shows an l\nNaChB\na\nc\n activation and steady-state inactivation currents (upper), and normalized activation curve (n = 21; Â± SEM) and steady-state inactivation curve (n = 19; Â± SEM) (lower). Figure 2C shows recovery from inactivation. The time interval between the test pulse (-10 mV, 4000 ms) and the inactivation pulse (-10 mV, 4000 ms) were varied from 250 ms to 16s. The ratio between currents elicited by the two pulses were used to construct the recovery curve (n = 20; Â± SEM). The half-time for recovery was 600 ms. Figure 2D illustrates IÏaC\nhBac\n single channels and ensemble average. \n\n [0083] Figures 3A-3F show â\nNaChBac\n that is Na\n+\n-selective. Current traces in Figures 3A-3C were elicited by a test pulse to -1OmV, VH=- 10OmV. Figure 3A shows l\nNaChBac\n to be impemieant to Cl\n\"\n as shown by cation substitution with N- methyl-D-glutamine (NMDG). Figure 3B shows l\nN\na\nChBac\n to be poorly permeable to Ca\n2+\n. Peak current is isotonic [Ca\n2+\nJ\n0\n was 87 pA (7.6 Â± 0.9 pA/pF, n =8) compared to 1430 pA (135.9 Â± 11 pA/pF, n=8) in 140 mM [Na\n+\n]\no\n/lmM[Ca\n2+\n]\nÎ±\n Figure 3C illustrates l\nN\na\nChBac\n conductances at various [Na\n+\n]\n0\n. Figure 3D illustrates mean current density plotted as function of test potential in the presence of 20, 50 and 140 mM [Na\n+\nJ\n0\n (n = 8; Â± SEM). Figure 3E illustrates tail currents recorded at various test potentials following depolarizing to 0 mV. l\nNaChBac\ntail current amplitudes plotted as a function of test potential were used to determine reversal potentials (inset). Figure 3F shows E\nrev\n as a function of [Na\n+\n]\n0\n. The E\nrev\n/[Na\n+\n]\n0\n relation was best fit by a line with slope of 57.8 mV/decade (error bars smaller than symbols).\n\n\n[0084] Figures 4A-G illustrate sensitivity of lNaC\nhB\nac to Ca\nv\n and Na\nv\n channel blockers. Figure 4A shows representative traces before (control) and after the addition of 100 Î¼M Cd\n2+\n. Figure 4B shows l\nN\na\nChBac\n dose response curves to Cd\n2+\n and Ni\n2+\n. Figure 4C shows lNaCh\nB\nac that is reversibly blocked by nifedipine. Figure 4D shows dose response curves where l\nNaChB\nac is sensitive to the dihydropyridine class (nifedipine and nimodipine) of L-type Ca\nv\n channel blockers. l\nNaChB\naois relatively insensitive to the T-type Ca\nv\n channel blocker mibefradil. Figure 4E shows that ÎªNaC\nhB\nac is insensitive to tetrodotoxin (TTX). Figure 4F is a summary of lNaChBac inhibition by various Ca\nv\n -blocking agents. Figure 4G is a summary of concentration of agent needed to block lNaC\nhBac\n by 50% (IC50) as measured from dose response curves.\n\n\n[0085] Figures 5A-C illustrates the structure of NaChBac and alignment of amino acid sequences of the P loops of Cav and NaChBac. Figure 5 A shows the alignment of the putative pore region of NaChBac with that of the four domains (I- IV) of Cayl .2 channel. The numbers correspond to residues in the P loop of Cayl .2 domain I. Residues in the EEEE selectivity filter motif are boxed. Residues in red refer to relevant mutation sites. Figure 5B shows that NaChBac contains 274 amino acid residues, here color-coded according to their properties. Figure 5C shows the alignment of the putative pore region of NaChBac and NaChBac mutants. \n\n [0086] Figures 6A-C illustrate voltage- and time-dependence oi\n'\nwt NaChBac andNaChBac mutants. Figure 6A shows the representative currents recorded in 10 mM Ca\n2+\n/140 Na\n+\n modified Tyrode's solution (left) from NaChBac and mutant NaChBac with residues 190-196 as indicated. Voltage was stepped from V\nH\n \n=\n-100 mV to +100 mV in 10 mV increments at 15 s intervals. Figure 6B shows the averaged I- V curves derived from currents recorded as in Figure 6 A of NaChBac and mutant NaChBac (n= 8-12 cells each). Figure 6C shows the activation (upper; V\nH\n=- 100 mV) and steady state inactivation (lower; V\nH\n=- 100 mV, prepulse to 0 mV for 2 s) curves of NaChBac and mutant NaChBac (n= 7-12 cells each).\n\n\n[0087] Figures 7A-D illustrate relative current amplitudes, current densities, and permeabilities of wt NaChBac and mutant NaChBac. Figure 7A shows the original traces elicited by depolarizing from â100 mV to 0 mV in 10 mM Ca\n2\nVl 40 Na\n+\n solution (black) and in isotonic Ca\n2+\n (105 mM) solution (red). Figure 7B shows the averaged peak current densities of wt NaChBac and mutant NaChBac (n= 8). Figure 7C shows that the current amplitudes were normalized to the current amplitude in 10 mM Ca\n2+\n/140 Na\n+\n solution (n= 8). Figure 7D shows the relative permeabilities (P- \nC\na/PNa) of wt NaChBac and mutant NaChBac.\n\n\n[0088] Figures 8A-B illustrate currents of the Ca\n2+\n-selective CaChBac\nm\n (LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7)) mutant compared to wt NaChBac (LESWAS (SEQ ID NO: 6)). Figure 8A shows that the current amplitude of the LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7) mutant recorded in 10 mM Ca\n2+\nA 40 mM Na\n+\n solution was not significantly different from that recorded in 10 mM Ca\n2+\n mM/140 NMDG solution. Figure 8B shows that the current amplitude of the wt NaChBac (LESWAS (SEQ ID NO: 6)) was virtually eliminated by replacing 140 mM [Na]\n0\n by 140 mM [NMDG].\n\n\n[0089] Figures 9A-D illustrate that CaChBaC\nn\n, (LDDWAD mutant (SEQ ID NO: 7)) is a Ca\n2+\n selective channel. Figure 9A shows the CaChBac\nm\n (LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: I)) currents in various [Ca\n2+\nJ\n0\n (substituted by Na\n+\n to maintain isotonicity) elicited by depolarization from -100 to 0 mV. Figure 9B shows the normalized current amplitude of the LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7) mutant plotted as a function of [Ca\n2+\n]\n0\n with Na\n+\n substitution (Â± SEM, n=6). Figure 9C shows the averaged current density- voltage relations of LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7) in external \n\n solutions containing 1 mM, 10 mM and 105 mM Ca\nzÏ\n(Â± SEM, n=6). Figure 9D shows the reversal potentials (E\nrev\n) of the LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7) mutant plotted as a function of log [Ca\n2+\nJ\n0\n (Na\n+\n substitution; Â± SEM, n=6). The slope was fitted by linear regression analysis slope (25.6 mV per decade), close to slope predicted by the Nernst equation at 22\n0\nC (29 mV).\n\n\n[0090] Figures 1 OA-B illustrate that the NaChBac LESWAD (SEQ ID NO: 8) mutant is sensitive to Ca\n2+\n blockade. Figure 1OA shows the currents recorded at 0 mV in varying [Ca\n2+\nJ\n0\n with Na\n+\n substitution. Figure 1OB shows the averaged I-V relations of the LESWAD (SEQ ID NO: 8) mutant in 10 Î¼M, 1 mM, 10 mM and 105 mM [Ca\n2+\n]\no\n (Â± SEM, n=6). Note that the current density, but not E\nrev\n, changed with increasing [Ca\n2+\n J\n0\n.\n\n\n[0091] The invention will be further characterized by the following examples which are intended to be exemplary of the invention.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nIsolation and Sequencing\n\n\n[0092] NaChBac was cloned from Bacillus Halodurans C- 125 DNA by PCR using Pfu polymerase and primers designed according to the deposited sequence (GenBank # BAB0522)). The deduced sequence is identical to the deposited sequence except for 2 differences: Nucleotide 33 (T in our line vs. C in the deposited sequence; no change in amino acid); Nucleotide 818 (T vs. C; L to S Amino acid change). There is a large deletion (>1 kb) in the deposited sequence immediately after the ORF. Multiple clones from different amplification reactions were sequenced to verify our cDNA. The possible errors in the deposited C-125 sequence probably resulted from the shotgun method of sequence assembly.\n\n\n[0093] Isolation and sequencing of the gene NaChBac revealed an open reading frame of 274 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 31 kDa and a pi of 9.35 (Fig. IA). When expressed in bacteria, NaChBac migrated at -34 kDa (Fig. IB). Hydrophobicity analysis was consistent with a 6TM domain primary structure (Fig. 1C). NaChBac contains an S4 segment with positively charged amino acids \n\n (KJR) interspersed every third residue (Fig. IA), characteristic ot voltage-gateÎ± ion channels. A BLAST search against the database revealed that the function proteins with the closest similarity to NaChBac are Ca\nv\n channels (see also (7)). In contrast to Ca\nv\n channels that have 4 negatively charged amino acids in the pore, Na\nv\n channels have glutamate/aspartate residues in domains I and II, but lysine and alanine in domains III and IV (Fig. 1C). Replacing the lysine/alanine in domains III and IV of Na\nv\n with glutamatic acid conferred Ca\n2+\n channel properties onto the Na\nv\n channel (10). A functional Ca\nv\n or Na\nv\n composed of only 6 transmembrane domains has never been effected despite several attempts to artificially divide the large 4-repeat (X\n1\n subunits into single repeats (11, 12).\n\n\nDetection of Current\n\n\n[0094] NaChBac was subcloned into an eGFP-containing pTracer-CMV2 vector (Invitrogen) for expression into CHO-Kl and COS-7 cells. DNA was transfected using LT2 (PanVera), plated onto coverslips, and recordings made 24-48 hrs later. Unless otherwise stated, the pipette solution contained (in mM); 147 Cs, 120 methane-sulfonate, 8 NaCl, 10 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP\n5\n 20 HEPES (pH 7.4). Bath solution contained (in mM); 130 NaCl, 10 CaCl\n2\n, 5 KCl, 20 HEPES and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). All experiments were conduct ed at 22Â°C Â± 2Â° C. Unless otherwise indicated, all chemicals were dissolved in water. Nifedipine (dissolved in DMSO), Ï-Agatoxin IVA, Ï-Conotoxin GVIA, and (Â±)Bay K 8644 (dissolved in ethanol were purchased from Alomone Labs. Tetrodotoxin was from Sigma. When water was not the solvent, the final concentration of the solvents was less than 1% and did not affect the channel activity. Unknown agents, presumably leached from perfusion tubing, caused fast inactivation and these perfusion systems were subsequently avoided.\n\n\n[0095] We transfected NaChBac into CHO-Kl or COS-7 cells and recorded whole-cell current 24-48 hrs after transfection. NaChBac-transfected cells displayed robust large (-1000 to >10,000 pA) voltage-activated inward current (Fig. 2A). This large current is unlike the native CHO small (50 pA), fast inactivating, TTX-sensitive current (13) present in up to 20% of cells. Similar currents were not recorded in nontransfected or mock-transfected CHO-Kl or COS-7 cells. lNa\nC\nhBAc \n\n reversed at +70 mV, close to the Nernst potential OfNa\n+\n (Ew\na\n =+72mV). I \nN\naC\nh\nB\nA\nc activated relatively slowly (Ï = 12.9 Â± 0.4 ms at -10 mV, n = 32) compared to Na\nv\n channels (Ï < 2ms). Inactivation was also slow (Ï = 166 Â± 13 ms at -10 mV, n = 32) compared to the typically fast inactivating Na\nv\n current (Ï < 10 ms. (I)).\n\n\nVoltage-Dependent Activation\n\n\n[0096] Voltage-dependent activation was evaluated by measuring the deactivation tail current (Fig. 2B). A Boltzmann fit of the averaged curve yielded at Vi\n/\n, of -24mV. Steady-state inactivation of the channel was determined by a sequential depolarization to test voltages followed by clamp to the peak of activation at -10 mV. Steady state inactivation was a steep function of voltage, with 50% inactivation at -40 mV (Fig. 2B). The channel recovered slowly from inactivation (Fig. 2C), with 50% recovery by 660 ms and 90% recovery by 5.5 seconds (-100 mV).\n\n\nChannel Properties\n\n\n[0097] The single channel properties of NaChBac were studied in the inside-out patch configuration. Solutions were the same as used in whole-cell recording except that the pipette and bath solutions were reversed. The unitary single channel conductance was best fit with a slope of 12 pS Â± 1 pS (n = 7 cells). Consistent with the whole-cell current, single channels were activated by depolarization and both open and closed times varied as a function of voltage (not shown). An ensemble average of single channel currents from 5 cells resembled whole cell l\nNaChBac\n with Ï act = 10 Â± 3.5 ms and Ï\ninac\nt = 203 Â± 43 ms (Fig. 2D).\n\n\n[0098] Cation replacement with NMDG resulted in the complete removal of voltage-dependent inward current (Fig. 3A), suggesting that NaChBac was impermeant to anions. The internal pipette solution used in determining the relative permeability of K\n+\n and Ca\n2+\n contained (in mM) 133 Cs-methanesulfonate, 5 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH adjust to 7.2 with CsOH). External solution for K\n+\n permeability experiments contained 142 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose (pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH). External solution for Ca\n+\n permeability determinations \n\n contained 105 CaCl\n2\n, 10 HEPES\n5\n 20 glucose (pH 7.3, adjusted with Ca(OH\n2\n). The external solution used to study Ma\n+\n permeability contained (in mM): 140 NaCl , 5CsCl, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose (pH 7.3, adjusted with NaOH). Internal solutions were the same as described in the Detection of Current example. The relative permeability of Cs\n+\n versus Na\n+\n was calculated according to: \n\n\n ([Na]o-[Na]\ni\nexp(E\nre\nvF/RT)/([Cs]i exp(E\nrev\nF/RT)/([Cs]\n0\n) (1)\n\n\n[0099] The relative permeabilities of K\n+\n and Ca\n2+\n were evaluated under bi-ionic conditions, and the relative permeability of K\n+\n and Ca\n2+\n to Cs\n+\n was calculated according to the following equations: \n\n\n [CsJjexptErevF/RTypCJo (2)\n\n\nPca/Pc\ns\n= ([Cs]iexp(E\nrev\nF/RT){exp(E\nre\nvR/RT)+l }/4[Ca]\n0\n) (3)\n\n\n[00100] l\nN\naC\nhB\nac was weakly permeant to Ca\n2+\n; no significant difference in current was observed by sequential perfusion with bath solution containing 1 and 10 mM [Ca\n2+\nJo (Fig. 3B ). In isotonic [Ca\n2+\n]\n0\n (cations replaced with 105 mM Ca\n2\n), in the inward current was < 6% of that in normal [Na\n+\n] (7.6 Â± 0.9 pA/pF at -10 mV, n = 8; Fig. 3B). In contrast, lNaChBac amplitude correlated well with [Na\n+\nJ\n0\n (Fig. 3C, D). To estimate the E\nre\nv of iNaChBac, deactivation tail currents were measured according to the protocol shown in Fig. 3E. Measured reversal potentials plotted as a function of [Na\n+\nJ\n0\n had a slope of 57.8 mV/decade, close to the 58 mV/decade slope predicted for a Na\n+\n -selective pore (Fig. 3F). To estimate the relative ion selectivity of the channel, we measured changes in reversal potential while changing ionic composition. The calculated relative selectivity (Â± SEM) of NaChBac based on measured E\nrev\n was: P\nNa\n/Pca - 72 Â± 10 (n = 12); \n\n\n 383 Â± 56 (n = 8); P\nNa\n/PÎº = 171 Â± 16 (n = 8). lNaC\nh\nBac selectivity for Na\n+\n is at least as high as traditional Na\nv\n channels (/, 14). \n\n [00101] The pharmacological sensitivity of lNaChBac to known Na\nv\n and Ca\nv\n blockers most closely resembles L type Ca\nv\n channels. Cd\n2+\n (100 Î¼M; Fig. 4A). Co\n2+\n (1 mM), and La\n3+\n (1 mM) all reduced the channel current to various degrees (Fig. 4F). lNaC\nhB\nac was most sensitive to dihydropyridines (nifedipine and nimodipine; Fig. 4C, D, G) with IC50s of 2.2 Î¼M and 1 Î¼M, respectively (Fig. 4G). The dose response curves to dihydropyridines is comparable to that of mammalian Ca\nvs\n (15). lNa\nChB\nac was relatively insensitive to the T type Ca\nv\n channel antagonists, mibefradil (IC50 = 22 Î¼M) and Ni\n2+\n (IC50 = 720 Î¼M, Fig. 4B, D, G). The Ca\nv\n N type blocker, Ï-Conotoxin GVIA, and the Ca\nv\n P/Q blocker, Ï-Agatoxin IVA, were ineffective even at concentrations (3 Î¼M and 500 nM respectively) well above those used to block their respective targets (Fig. 4F). The channel was completely insensitive to the Na\n+\n channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX; up to 30 Î¼M; Fig. 4E, F).\n\n\n[00102] iNaC\nhB\nac's sensitivity to dihydropyridines is not obvious from a sequence comparison to the known sites for Ca\nv\n dihydropyridine sensitivity (16 - 18). Not surprisingly, the residues involved in Na\nv\n TTX binding (19 â 22) do not match identically to residues in NaChBac.\n\n\n[00103] NaChBac encodes a 6 TM domain, dihydropyridine-sensitive, TTX-insensitive Na\n+\n selective current. NaChBac is the first bacterial voltage-gated channel characterized in detail in an intact biological membrane. lNaC\nhBac\n differs from traditional 24TM Na\nv\n eukaryotic channels in its slower (roughly 10 fold) activation, inactivation, and recovery from inactivation. The slow inactivation kinetics are similar to that of mammalian persistent sodium current i\nNa\np- l\nNaP\n currents have been recorded from mammalian central and peripheral nerve system neurons and are believed to play important roles in neuronal function ((23) for review). A noninactivating, TTX-insensitive voltage-gated Na\n+\n channel current has been recorded from mammalian dorsal ganglion neurons, but its sensitivity to dihydropyridines is not known (24). A novel class of NaChBac-related mammalian homologs, including CatSper, are reasonable candidates for some persistent Na\n+\n currents. \n\n EXAMPLE 2\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nExpression of Wild-type and Mutant NaChBac\n\n\n[00104] NaChBac was cloned from Bacillus halodurans C- 125 DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR; BAB05220) (Ren, Navarro et al. 2001). The NaChBac construct containing an open reading frame of 274 amino acid residues was subcloned into a pTracer-CMV2 vector (Invitrogen,Carlsbad, CA) containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The skeletal muscle Na\n+\n channel SKMl (M26643) was used in comparison to NaChBac under identical recording conditions and determinations of permeability ratios. Mutations were introduced into the NaChBac cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis (Quickchangeâ¢ site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene; La Jolla, CA). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing and restriction digestion. Wild-type NaChBac and mutant cDNAs were transfected into CHO-Kl cells or COS-7 cells with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). Transfected cells were identified by fluorescence microscopy and membrane currents were recorded 24 to 48 hours after transfection.\n\n\nElectrophysiology and Data Analysis\n\n\n[00105] Unless otherwise stated, the pipette solution contained (in mM); 147 Cs, 120 methanesulfonate, 8 NaCl, 10 EGTA, 2 Mg\n2+\n-adenosine triphosphate, and 20 HEPES (pH 7.4). Bath solution contained (in mM); 140 NaCl, 10 CaCl\n2\n, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), and 10 glucose. For some experiments, NaCl was isotonically replaced by CaCl\n2\n.\n\n\n[00106] For reversal potential measurements to determine the relative permeabilities OfNa\n+\n and Ca \n+\n, the internal pipette solution contained (in mM): 100 mM Na-Gluconate, 10 NaCl, 10 EGTA, 20 HEPES-Na (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH, [Na\n+\n]\ntota\ni= 140). The external solution was (inmM): 140 NMDG-Cl, 10 CaCl\n2\n, 20 HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with HCl) or 80 NMDG-Cl, 50 CaCl\n2\n, and 20 HEPES. The fast kinetics and small current amplitude of SKMl in 10 mM [Ca\n2+\n]\n0\n necessitated the \n\n use of 50 mM [Ca\n2+\n]\n0\n for accurate determination of E\nrev\n. The permeability ratio of Ca\n2+\n was estimated according to the following equation:\n\n\nPca/PÏ=a\nsi\n(exp(E\nr\nevF/RT)[(exp(E\nr\nevF/RT)+l]/(4a\nse\n)\n\n\nwhere R, T, F, and E\nrev\n are the gas constant, absolute temperature, Faraday constant, and reversal potential, respectively, and x represents Cs\n+\n or Na\n+\n (i, internal; e, external) (Hille 2001). For calculations of membrane permeability, activity coefficients for Ca\n2+\n, Cs\n+\n and Na\n+\n were estimated as follows:\n\n\na\ns\n = Î³\ns\n[Xs]\n\n\nwhere activity, a\ns\n, is the effective concentration of an ion in solution, s related to the nominal concentration [X\ns\n] by the activity coefficient, Î³\ns\n . Î³\ns\n was calculated from the Debye-Huckel equation:\n\n\nlog Î³\ns\n = -0.51*z\ns\n \n2\nVÎ¼/[l+ 3.8Î±\nÏ\nVÎ¼]\n\n\nwhere Î¼ is the ionic strength of the solution, z\ns\n is the charge on the ion, and ct\ns\n is the effective diameter of the hydrated ion in nanometers (nm). The calculated activity coefficients were Î³\n(\nc\nS)\ni\n=\n0-70, Î³(c\na)e\n=0.331, Î³\n(Na)\ni\n=\n0.75 and Î³\n(Na)e\n=0.73. The liquid junction potentials were measured using a salt bridge as described by Neher (Neher 1992) and these measurements agreed within 3 mV to those calculated by the JPCaIc program (P. Barry) within Clampex (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA).\n\n\n[00107] The voltage dependence of NaChBac and mutants channel activation was determined from a holding potential of -100 mV. Instantaneous tail current were measured at -100 mV after a test potential of 40 ms duration. Normalized tail current amplitude was plotted vs. test potentials and fitted with a Boltzmann function. Measurements of steady state inactivation for NaChBac and mutants channel were resolved using 2 s prepulses and 1 s test pulse to -10 mV, 0 mV or +20 mV depending on the mutant's peak voltage. Cells were held at -100 mV for 20 s between pulses to allow the recovery from inactivation. Normalized test current amplitude was plotted vs. prepulse potential and fitted with a Boltzmann function. \n\n The activation and steady state inactivation curve were fitted by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n\nI = Im\n3x\n - (WW(I + exp((V-V\n1/2\n)/*))\n\n\nwhere I\nmax\n and I\nm\ni\nn\n are the maximum and minimum current values, V is the test voltage, Vm is the voltage activation midpoint and k is the slope factor.\n\n\n[00108] Whole-cell currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) amplifier. Data were digitized at 10 or 20 kHz, and digitally filtered off-line at 1 kHz. Patch electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass and had resistances of 2-5 MÎ©. All experiments were conducted at 22Â° Â± 2\n0\nC. For CHO cells, cell capacitance was 7.6 Â± 0.3 pF and for COS-7 cells was 13.9 Â±\n\n\n0.6 pF. Mutant NaChBac current amplitudes ranged from -100-800 pA. Forwt NaChBac, current amplitudes ranged 800 pA to 2 nA. Series resistance (R\ns\n) was compensated up to 90% to reduce all series resistance errors to <5 mV. Cells in which R\n5\n was >10 mÎ© were discarded. Pooled data are presented as means + SEM. Statistical comparisons were made using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and two-tailed t-test with Bonferroni correction; P < 0.05 indicated statistical significance.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\n[00109] The mutations of the NaChBac pore region described in this study are summarized in Figure 5. The six relevant pore amino acids in NaChBac are LESWAS (SEQ ID NO: 6) (residues 190-195), and mutants are specified with respect to this nomenclature.\n\n\nExpression Levels ofwt and Mutant NaChBac\n\n\n[00110] The wt NaChBac currents and I-V curve were similar to those previously reported in CHO-Kl cells (Ren, Navarro et al. 2001), but 4 to 6 times larger in COS- 7 cells (Figure 6A). Current densities of the LESWAD (SEQ ID NO: 8), LEDWAS (SEQ ID NO: 9), LEDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 10), LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7), and \n\n especially LEDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 10) mutants were smaller than that of wt NaChBac (24-48 hours after transfection). More than 98% of wt NaChBac-GFP expressing cells had substantial currents, whereas only 30% to 50% LESWAD (SEQ ID NO: 8) -, LEDWAS (SEQ ID NO: 9)-, LEDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 10)- or LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7)-GFP transfected cells produced detectable currents. The LEGWAS (SEQ ID NO: 11) mutant current was essentially the same as wt NaChBac and is not further described. GESWAS (SEQ ID NO: 12), GEAWAS (SEQ ID NO: 13), LKSWAS (SEQ ID NO: 14) and LASWAS (SEQ ID NO:15) mutant currents were not measurable.\n\n\nKinetics of the NaChBac Mutant Channels\n\n\n[00111] The averaged current density-voltage relations (I-V relations) are shown in (Figure 6B). LEDWAS (SEQ ID NO: 9), LEDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 10) and LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7) mutant currents peaked at 0 mV while the LESWAD (SEQ ID NO: 8) mutant peaked at +10 mV. Figure 6C and Table 1 summarizes the activation, inactivation, and slope factor for the most interesting NaChBac mutants. The 50% steady state inactivation (Vi\n/2\n-inact) of LESWAD (SEQ ID NO: 8), LEDWAS (SEQ ID NO: 9), and LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7) were similar to those of wt NaChBac, while the midpoints of their activation curves were shifted 19, 22, and 26 mV, respectively, in the positive direction. The difference in the midpoint voltage (V]\n/2\n) and slope factor (k) activation of wt NaChBac and the mutants suggests that introduction of aspartate into the pore region altered the gating function of the channel. The activation and inactivation kinetics of these mutants are similar to that of wt NaChBac with the exception of the LESWAD (SEQ ID NO: 8) mutant, which inactivated 2.7 times more rapidly than wt NaChBac (p<0.05).\n\n\nSelectivity of the NaChBac Mutant Channels\n\n\n[00112] Reversal potentials of the NaChBac mutants were measured under bi- ionic conditions as described in the Methods. Figure 7A shows representative currents of wt NaChBac, LEGWAS (SEQ ID NO: 11), LEDWAS (SEQ ID NO: 9), LEDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 10) and LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7) mutants recorded in 10 mM Ca\n2+\n (modified Tyrode's) solution and isotonic (105 mM) Ca\n2+\n solution. \n\n NaChBac (wt) and LEGWAS (SEQ ID NO: 11) currents were practically undetectable after replacement of the 140 mM Na\n+\n/ 10 rnM Ca\n2+\n-containing solution by the 0 mM Na\n+\n/105 mM Ca\n2+\n solution, indicating the low Ca\n2+\n permeability of these channels. Current amplitudes of the LEDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 10) and LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7) mutants were significantly increased when the external solution was changed to isotonic Ca\n2+\n solution while the amplitude of LEDWAS (SEQ ID NO: 9) mutant currents was not significantly increased. The LESWAD (SEQ ID NO: 8) mutant current was dramatically decreased in isotonic [Ca\n2+\n]\n0\n . The average peak current amplitude measured at 0 mV obtained in 10 mM Ca\n2+\n Tyrode's solution or in 105 mM Ca\n2+\n solution is shown in Figure 7B and normalized to the current amplitude measured in 10 mM Ca\n2+\n solution (Figure 7C).\n\n\n[00113] Relative permeability (Pc\na\n/P\nNa\n) was calculated as described in the Methods and Table 1. Since Pc\na\n/PNahad not been described for native Na\nv\n channels under these specific conditions, we also measured the relative permeability for SICMl, a skeletal muscle Na\n+\n-selective channel (SKMl; Kraner, Rich et al. 1998) was expressed in COS and CHO cells and examined under identical conditions as NaChBac and similar to its mutants; Table 1). For NaChBac, substitution of serine (192) by glycine (LEGWAS (SEQ ID NO: 11)) did not change NaChBac' s relative permeability (LESWAS (SEQ ID NO: 14): Pc\na\n/PN\na\n^O.lS. Replacement of the serine at position 195 by aspartate (D195S; LESWAD (SEQ IDNO: 8)) converted the normally Na\n+\n-selective wt NaChBac (Pc\na\n/P\nNa\n \n=\n0.15) into a relatively non-selective cation channel (Pc\na\n/PNa\n=\n 17).\n\n\n[00114] As uncharged amino acids were replaced by an increasing number of negatively charged aspartates, Ca\n2+\nselectivity dramatically increased. Replacing the serine at position 192 by aspartate (D192S; LEDWAS (SEQ ID NO: 9)) increased wt NaChBac' s Ca\n2+\n selectivity over Na\n+\n by 233-fold (P\nCa\n/P\nNa\n=35). Although the current amplitude was reduced, substitution of serines 192 and 195 by aspartate (LEDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 10)) increased Ca\n2+\n selectivity by 486-fold (P\nCa\n/PNa= 73). Further substitution by the negatively charged aspartate into position 195 (LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7); denoted CaChBac\nm\n) yielded the highest Ca\n2+\n permeability (Pca/PNa =133), with a much larger current amplitude (500 to 1000 pA) in 10 mM Ca\n2+\n solution. As shown in Figure 8 A, the current amplitude of CaChBac\nm\n \n\n in 10 mM Ca\n2+\n solution was virtually identical to that obtained in 10 mM Ca\n2+\n/ NMDG solution, suggesting that CaChBac\nm\n's conductance was not permeant to, nor affected by, [Na\n+\n ]\n0\n. In comparison, the wt LESWAS (SEQ ID NO: 14) current was almost undetectable in 10 mM Ca\n24\nVNMDG solution (Figure 8B), consistent with it being a relatively selective Na\n+\n channel.\n\n\nThe Anomalous Mole Fraction Effect\n\n\n[00115] Ca\n2+\n -selective channels exhibit a concentration-dependent permeability ratio, called the anomalous mole fraction effect. This effect is thought to be a consequence of the Ca\n2+\n channel's capacity to hold two or more divalent ions in the pore at the same time, and is usually interpreted to mean that ions interact within the pore. CaChBac\nm\n's (LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7)) conductance increased with increasing external [Ca\n2+\nJ\n0\n and its conductance to Na\n+\n increased when [Ca\n2+\nJ\n0\n was decreased to 10 Î¼M (Figure 9A). Presumably at low [Ca\n2+\n]\n0\n, the pore binding site for Ca\n2+\n is no longer occupied and Na\n+\n is less impeded in its transit through the pore. The normalized current amplitude plotted as a function of [Ca\n2+\nJ\n0\n (Figure 9B) is typical of anomalous mole fraction behavior.\n\n\nCaChBaCm is a Calcium-Selective Channel.\n\n\n[00116] CaChBac\nm\n's (LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7)) channel conductance increased and the reversal potentials shifted to more positive potentials as [Ca\n2+\nJ\n0\n was increased from 1 to 10 to 105 mM (Figure 9C). A plot of reversal potentials against log[Ca\n2+\n]\n0\n was best fit by a linear regression slope of 25.6 + 3.2 mV/decade (mean Â± SEM, n=8) close to that predicted by the Nernst equation for a Ca\n2+\n- selective electrode (29 mV/decade; Fig. 9D)). CaChBac\nm\n (LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7)) is thus a Ca\n2+\n-selective channel.\n\n\n[00117] Interestingly, the LESWAD (SEQ ID NO: 8) mutant that displayed a decreased permeability to Na\n+\n compared to wt NaChBac, was blocked by [Ca\n2+\nJ\n0\n. Figure 1OA shows LESWAD (SEQ ID NO: 8) currents recorded at 1 Î¼M, 1 mM, 10 mM (in 130 mM [Na\n+\nJ\n0\n), and 105 mM [Ca\n2+\nJ\n0\n. The LESWAD (SEQ ID NO: 8) mutant permeable to both Na\n+\n and Ca\n2+\n, were largest in 10 Î¼M Ca\n2+\n solution and \n\n smallest in 105 mM [Ca\n2+\n]. The mean I-V relations of LESWAD (SEQ ID NO: 8) under various [Ca\n2+\nJ\n0\n are shown in Figure 1OB.\n\n\n[00118] We have used the simple 274 amino acid bacterial voltage-gated Na\n+\n- selective channel to explore the mechanism of Na\n+\n and Ca\n2+\n selective permeation. This opportunity is fairly unique since no other voltage-gated ion-selective bacterial channel has been functionally expressed in mammalian systems and there are no known mammalian voltage-gated Ca\n2+\nor Na\n+\n-selective channels with the single repeat structure. Together with the wild-type NaChBac, the mutants described here suggest that voltage-gated Na-selective, Ca\n2+\n-selective, and NaVCa\n2+\n permeable cation channels can all be formed with the polypeptides of single repeat of the 6 transmembrane-domain (6TM). The single-repeat 6 TM structure is shared by voltage-gated potassium channels, TRP channels, and cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels. Voltage-gated Na\n+\n or Ca\n2+\n channels with this single-repeat structure have not been discovered in cells other than bacteria, but the recently reported mammalian sperm ion channels (Quill, et al. 2001; Ren, et al. 2001) may be candidates for the functional homologs of the bacterial channel.\n\n\n[00119] Our experiments show that mutation of amino acid residues in the pore domain can be mutated to make the channel cation nonselective, or even highly Ca\n2+\n-selective. The most illuminating mutations of the pore region occurred in the region between residues 190 and 195 amino acids of wild type NaChBac (LESWAS (SEQ ID NO: 14)). We found a correlation between increasing numbers of negatively charged aspartic acid substitutions within the domain and increasing Ca\n2+\n selectivity. The mutants denoted LESWAD (SEQ ID NO: 8), LEDWAS (SEQ ID NO: 9), LEDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 10) and LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7) displayed increasing selectivity for Ca\n2+\n, with LESWAD (SEQ ID NO: 8) having the lowest and LDDWAD (SEQ ID NO: 7) the highest Ca\n2+\nselectivity.\n\n\n[00120] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. \n\n REFERENCES\n\n\nThe references cited below and incorporated throughout the application are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n1.

No. 60/392,062, filed Jun. 26, 2002.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThis invention is related to the field of neuroscience and neurology. In particular embodiments it is related to the area of axon guidance cues and their modulators, and neurological drug screening using repulsive guidance molecules and Neogenin.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nOne of the most important mechanisms in formation of embryonic nervous systems is the guidance of axons and growth cones by directional guidance cues (Goodman, Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 19 (1996), 341-77; Mueller, Annu. Rev. Neurosci 22, (1999), 351-88). A suitable model system for studying this guidance process is the retinotectal system of vertebrates. In the chick embryo approximately 2 million retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons leave each eye and grow towards the contralateral tectum opticum to form a precise map (Mey & Thanos, (1992); J. Hirnforschung 33,673-702). Having arrived at the anterior pole of the optic tectum, RGC axons start to invade their tectal target to find their target neurons. Mapping occurs in such a way that RGC axons from nasal retina project to posterior tectum and temporal axons to anterior tectum. Along the dorso-ventral axis, axons coming from dorsal retina terminate in ventral tectum, whereas those from ventral retina end up in dorsal tectum. Ultimately, a precise topographic map is formed, where neighborhood relationships in the retina are preserved in the tectum so that axons from neighboring ganglion cells in the retina synapse with neighboring tectal neurons. Most important for formation of this map are graded tectal guidance cues, read by retinal growth cones carrying corresponding receptors which also show a graded distribution (Sperry, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 50 (1963), 703710; Bonhoeffer & Gierer, Trends Neurosci. 7 (1984) 378-381).\n\n\nPosition of each retinal growth cone in the tectal field is therefore determined by two sets of gradients: receptor gradients on in-growing retinal axons and growth cones and ligand gradients on tectal cells (Gierer, Development 101 (1987), 479-489). The existence of the graded tectal ligands has been postulated from anatomical work. Their identification, however, proved to be extremely difficult and was only made possible with the development of simple in vitro systems (Walter ; Development 101 (1987), 685-96; Cox, Neuron 4 (1990), 31-7). In the stripe assay, RGC axons grow on a membrane carpet, consisting of alternating lanes of anterior (a) and posterior (p) tectal membranes. On these carpets, temporal retinal axons grow on anterior tectal membranes and are repelled by the posterior lanes, whereas nasal axons do not distinguish between a and p membranes (Walter, Development 101 (1987), 685-96). The same specificity is also observed in the growth cone collapse assay (Raper & Kapfhammer, Neuron 4 (1990), 21-29) where temporal retinal growth cones collapse after addition of posterior tectal membrane vesicles but do not react to anterior tectal vesicles and where nasal growth cones are insensitive to either type of vesicles (Cox, (1990), loc. cit.). In both assay systems, treatment of posterior tectal membranes with the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (which cleaves the lipid anchor of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins) removed their repellent and collapse-inducing activity (Walter, J. Physiol 84 (1990), 104-10).\n\n\nOne of the first repulsive guidance molecules identified in the retinotectal system of chick embryos was a GPI-anchored glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 33/35 kDa (Stahl, Neuron 5 (1990), 735-43). This 33/35 kDa molecule, later termed RGM (Repulsive Guidance Molecule), was active in both stripe and collapse-assays and was shown to be expressed in a low-anterior high-posterior gradient in the embryonic tecta of chick and rat (Mueller, Curr. Biol. 6 (1996), 1497-502; Mueller, Japan Scientific Societies Press (1997), 215-229). Due to the abnormal biochemical behavior of RGM, the precise amino acid sequence was not easily obtainable. RGM was described as a molecule which is active during vertebrate development. Interestingly, RGM is downregulated in the embryonic chick tectum after E12 and in the embryonic rat tectum after P2 and completely disappears after the embryonic stages (Muller (1992), Ph. D thesis University of TÃ¼bbingen; MÃ¼ller (1997) Japan Scientific Societies, 215-229). In 1996, MÃ¼ller (loc. cit.) showed that CALI (chromophore-assisted laser inactivation) of RGM eliminates the repulsive guidance activity of posterior tectal membranes. However, due to the presence of other guidance molecules, in particular of RAGS (repulsive axon guidance signal) and ELF-1 (Eph ligand family 1), a complete elimination of guidance was not always detected and it was speculated that RGM acts in concert with RAGS (now termed ephrin-A5) and ELF-1 (ephrin-A2). It was furthermore envisaged that RGM may be a co-factor potentiating the activity of RAGS and ELF-1 in embryonic guidance events.\n\n\nIn 1980/81 the group of Aguayo found that, when peripheral neurons are transplanted/grafted into injured CNS of adult, axon growth of CNS neurons is induced (David, Science 214 (1981), 931-933). Therefore, it was speculated that CNS neurons have still the ability and capacity of neurite-outgrowth and/or regeneration, if a suitable environment would be provided. Furthermore, it was speculated that âCNS-neuron regeneration inhibitorsâ may exist.\n\n\nIn 1988, Caroni and Schwab (Neuron 1,85-96) described two inhibitors of 35 kDa and 250 kDa, isolated from rat CNS myelin (NI-35 and NI-250; see also Schnell, Nature 343 (1990) 269-272; Caroni, J. Cell Biol. 106 (1988), 1291-1288).\n\n\nIn 2000, the DNA encoding for NI-220/250 was deduced and the corresponding potent inhibitor of neurite growth was termed Nogo-A (Chen, Nature 403 (2000), 434-438). The membrane-bound Nogo turned out to be a member of the reticulon family (GrandPre, Nature 403 (2000), 439-444).\n\n\nFurther factors which mediate neuronal outgrowth inhibition have first been isolated in grasshoppers, and termed âfasciclin IVâ and later âcollapsinâ in chicken. These inhibitors belong to the so-called semaphorin family. Semaphorins have been reported in a wide range of species and described as transmembrane proteins (see, inter alia, Kolodkin Cell 75 (1993) 1389-99, PÃ¼schel, Neuron 14 (1995), 941-948). Yet, it was also shown that not all semaphorins have inhibitory activity. Some members of the family, e.g. semaphorin E, act as an attractive guidance signal for cortical axons (Bagnard, Development 125 (1998), 5043-5053).\n\n\nA further system of repulsive guidance molecules is the ephrin-Eph system. Ephrins are ligands of the Eph receptor kinases and are implicated as positional labels that may guide the development of neural topographic maps Flanagan, Ann. Rev. Neurosc. 21 (1998), 309-345). Ephrins are grouped in two classes, the A-ephrins which are linked to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor (GPIanchor) and the B-ephrins carrying a transmembrane domain (Eph nomenclature committee 1997). Two members of the A-ephrins, ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5, expressed in low anterior-high posterior gradients in the optic tectum, have recently been shown to be involved in repulsive guidance of retinal ganglion cell axons in vitro and in vivo (see, inter alia (Drescher, Cell 82 (1995), 359-70; Cheng, Cell 79 (1994), 157-168; Feldheim, Neuron 21 (1998), 563-74; Feldheim, Neuron 25 (2000), 563-74). Considering the fact that a plurality of physiological disorders or injuries are related to altered cellular migration processes, the technical problems underlying the present invention was to provide for means and methods for modifying developmental or cellular (migration) processes which lead to disease conditions.\n\n\nThe Ephrin, Semaphorin, Slit, and RGM families of extracellular guidance cues specify axonal trajectories during nervous system development\n1-3\n. The netrins are a family of proteins that are profound modulators of growth of developing axons, functioning as attractants for some axons and repellents of other axons. As such, the modulation of these effects provides an important therapeutic pathway for assisting the regeneration of axons in adult nervous system (e.g. following injury or trauma). While neuronal receptors have been identified for most axonal guidance cues, the mechanism by which the recently sequenced RGM protein (WO 02/051438) acts has not been clarified\n3\n. As described in part above, chick RGM is expressed in a posterior to anterior tectal gradient and has been shown to collapse temporal but not nasal retinal growth cones\n3\n. After signal peptide cleavage and GPI addition, the cell surface RGM is proteolytically processed to a mature active form of 33 kDa\n3\n.\n\n\nThe ability to construct high-throughput and specific pharmaceutical screens for modulators of guidance cues (such as RGM) has been limited by the lack of identifiable receptors. Identifying receptors on axons that mediate neural responsiveness to guidance cues will provide key targets for identifying lead pharmaceuticals for therapeutic intervention in the nervous system (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,087,326 and 5,747,262). Accordingly, because RGM has a demonstrated role in axon growth, it would be desirable to accurately identify the receptor through which RGM acts such that targeted screens could be conducted.\n\n\nNeogenin is known to share sequence similarity with the Netrin receptor Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC). The sequence for the Neogenin gene has been described (for example, Keeling S L, Gad J M, Cooper H M. âMouse Neogenin, a DCC-like molecule, has four splice variants and is expressed widely in the adult mouse and during embryogenesis.â Oncogene. Aug. 7, 1997;15(6):691-700. GenBank NT\nâ\n039474; NM\nâ\n008684) and it has been previously theorized that it is an interaction with Netrin-1 that is responsible for signaling through Neogenin. However, as described in detail herein, the present inventors have determined the true physiological ligand for Neogenin.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention identifies Neogenin as the receptor for Repulsive Guidance Molecule. Accordingly, the invention envisions the use of the previously described Neogenin and RGM molecules in combinations and methods which could not previously have been suggested. In particular, the invention allows for targeted screening assays and the development of inhibitors capable of specifically inhibiting the interaction between RGM and Neogenin.\n\n\nThe invention provides efficient methods of identifying agents, compounds or lead compounds for agents capable of modulating Neogenin cellular function. Generally, these screening methods involve assaying for compounds which modulate mammalian Neogenin interaction with a natural mammalian RGM. A wide variety of assays for binding agents are provided including labeled in vitro protein-protein binding assays, immunoassays, cell based assays, animal based assay, etc. Preferred methods are amenable to automated, cost-effective high throughput screening of chemical libraries for lead compounds. Such libraries encompass candidate agents of numerous chemical classes, though typically they are organic compounds; preferably small organic compounds and are obtained from a wide variety of sources including libraries of synthetic or natural compounds. Identified agents find use in the pharmaceutical industries for animal and human trials; for example, the agents may be derivatized and rescreened in in vitro and in vivo assays to optimize activity and minimize toxicity for pharmaceutical development.\n\n\nIn vitro binding assays employ a mixture of components including mammalian Neogenin protein, which may be part of a fusion product with another peptide or polypeptide, e.g. a tag for detection or anchoring, etc. The assay mixtures comprise a natural extracellular mammalian Neogenin binding target, such as a RGM. While native binding targets may be used, it is frequently preferred to use portions (e.g. peptides) thereof so long as the portion provides binding affinity and avidity to the subject mammalian Neogenin protein conveniently measurable in the assay. The assay mixture also comprises a candidate pharmacological agent and typically, a variety of other reagents such as salts, buffers, neutral proteins, e.g. albumin, detergents, protease inhibitors, nuclease inhibitors, antimicrobial agents, etc. The mixture components can be added in any order that provides for the requisite bindings and incubations may be performed at any temperature which facilitates optimal binding. The mixture is then incubated under conditions whereby, but for the presence of the candidate pharmacological agent, the mammalian Neogenin protein specifically binds the cellular binding target, portion or analog with a reference binding affinity. Incubation periods are likewise selected for optimal binding but also minimized to facilitate rapid, high-throughput screening.\n\n\nAfter incubation, the agent-biased binding between the mammalian Neogenin protein and one or more binding targets is detected. A separation step is often initially used to separate bound from unbound components. Separation may be effected by precipitation (e.g. TCA precipitation, immunoprecipitation, etc.), immobilization (e.g on a solid substrate), etc., followed by washing by, for examples, membrane filtration, gel chromatography (e.g. gel filtration, affinity, etc.). One of the components usually comprises or is coupled to a label. The label may provide for direct detection such as radioactivity, luminescence, optical or electron density, etc. or indirect detection such as an epitope tag, an enzyme, etc. A variety of methods may be used to detect the label depending on the nature of the label and other assay components, e.g. through optical or electron density, radiative emissions, nonradiative energy transfers, etc. or indirectly detected with antibody conjugates, etc. A difference in the binding affinity of the mammalian Neogenin protein to the target in the absence of the agent as compared with the binding affinity in the presence of the agent indicates that the agent modulates the binding of the mammalian Neogenin protein to the mammalian RGM. Analogously, in a cell-based transcription assay, a difference in the mammalian Neogenin transcriptional induction in the presence and absence of an agent indicates the agent modulates vertebrate such induced transcription. A difference, as used herein, is statistically significant and preferably represents at least a 50%, more preferably at least a 90% difference.\n\n\nThe invention provides methods and compositions for identifying pharmacological agents useful in the diagnosis or treatment of neurological disease or injury. In particular, the invention provides mixtures comprising an isolated (RGM) and an isolated Neogenin receptor capable of specifically binding said RGM. The general methods involve incubating a mixture comprising an isolated RGM, an isolated Neogenin receptor, and a candidate pharmacological agent, and determining if the presence of the agent modulates the binding of the RGM to the receptor. Specific agents provide lead compounds for pharmacological agents useful in the diagnosis or treatment of neurological disease or injury.\n\n\nIt is an object of the present invention to provide a method of monitoring the interaction of a RGM and a Neogenin.\n\n\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a method for monitoring the interaction between RGM and Neogenin so that agonists and antagonists can be identified.\n\n\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a polypeptide useful for antagonizing the interaction between a RGM and a Neogenin receptor.\n\n\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a polypeptide useful for antagonizing the interaction between RGM and Neogenin.\n\n\nThese and other objects of the invention are achieved by one or more of the embodiments described below. In one embodiment a method of monitoring the interaction of a RGM and a Neogenin receptor is provided. The method comprises the steps of:\n\n \n \n \n \ncontacting a first protein comprising an RGM with a second protein which comprises Neogenin under conditions where a domain of the RGM binds to a domain of the Neogenin;\n \ndetermining the binding of the first protein to the second protein or second protein to the first protein.\n \n \n \n\n\nAccording to another aspect of the invention a method is provided for monitoring the interaction between a RGM and a Neogenin.

When expressed in HEK293 cells, the cRGM-AP fusion protein was processed proteolytically to yield a 110 kDa fusion protein (data not shown). This material retained biological activity as demonstrated by the avoidance of cRGM-AP stripes by temporal retinal ganglion cell axons (\nFIG. 1A\n).\n\n\nThe cRGM-AP fusion protein does not bind to COS-7 kidney-derived cells, so we expressed an adult mouse brain cDNA expression library in these cells and screened for clones driving expression of cell surface binding activity. Only a single clone was identified in screens of 480,000 independent clones. This cDNA clone expressed a saturable binding site for cRGM-AP with a Kd of 230 pM (\nFIG. 1B-D\n). DNA sequence analysis revealed that the high affinity RGM-AP binding protein was Neogenin. In the mouse genome there are three RGM-related sequences, that we have termed mRGM-A, mRGM-B and mRGM-C. The three mouse RGM sequences share 41-49% aa identity and 55-61% aa similarity with one another. Chick RGM shares the highest level of identity with mRGM-A at 80% aa identity and 84% aa similarity. Both RGM-A and RGM-B are expressed in many regions of the developing mouse brain, so we tested if AP fusion proteins of these also bind to Neogenin. Both mRGM-A and mRGM-B bind mNeogenin with high affinity (\nFIG. 1E\n).\n\n\nTo verify that the RGM interaction with Neogenin was due to their participation in a physical complex, RGM and Neogenin were co-expressed in HEK293T cells and analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation. RGM precipitates contained detectable Neogenin but control immunoprcipitates did not (\nFIG. 2A\n). More relevant for in vivo activity, affinity chromatography using the RGM-AP protein isolated Neogenin protein from adult mouse brain tissue (\nFIG. 2B\n).\n\n\nThe RGM interaction with Neogenin raises several issues of specificity since Neogenin has been described previously as a Netrin binding protein\n4\n. RGM and Netrin-1 show no significant sequence similarity\n3\n. It should be noted that the reported Netrin binding affinity to Neogenin (Ë2nM) is an order of magnitude less than the RGM affinity (230pM). We considered whether RGM-AP binds to other known Netrin receptors. DCC is most closely related to Neogenin in sequence and the two proteins are reported to have similar affinities for Netrins. Functional studies have demonstrated a role for DCC in mediating axonal guidance by Netrins\n6,7\n, but the role of Neogenin in mediating axonal responses to Netrins have not been documented. DCC has no detectable affinity for RGM-AP, any affinity must be at least 50 fold less than for Neogenin (\nFIG. 3A\n). Unc5 proteins can bind Netrin-1 independently of DCC, and serve as obligate co-receptors together with DCC in axon repulsion by Netrins\n8\n. However, neither Unc5H1 nor Unc5H3 proteins bind RGM-AP (\nFIG. 3A\n). Netrin-1 is known to bind to the FNIII region of DCC, rather than the Ig domains\n9\n. Similarly, full RGM binding affinity is obtained with a truncated Neogenin containing only the FNIII repeats (\nFIG. 3B\n). This raises the possibility that RGM and Netrin bind to similar regions of Neogenin. However, the addition of excess Netrin-1 did not appear to alter RGM-AP binding to Neogenin (\nFIG. 3C\n). While functional interactions between Netrin and RGM might exist, the two protein do not appear to compete for binding to a single site on Neogenin.\n\n\nTo assess the role of Neogenin binding in RGM signalling in retinal ganglion axons, we purified the soluble recombinant ectodomain of Neogenin via a His tag, and tested its function-blocking capability. To the extent that RGM-Neogenin signalling contributes to retinotectal targeting, the soluble Neogenin ectodomain should disrupt the temporal retinal preference for anterior versus posterior tectal membranes in a stripe assay. The preference of temporal but not nasal retinal ganglion cell axons is obvious in the stripe assay under control conditions (\nFIG. 4A\n, C), as reported previously\n10,11\n. In the presence of soluble Neogenin the preference of temporal axons for anterior tectal stripes is lost (\nFIG. 4B\n). Blockade of retinal axon stripe preference is dose-dependent, with essentially complete blockade at 400 nM soluble Neogenin ectodomain (\nFIG. 4C\n). The tectum contains an anterior-to-posterior both RGM and ephrin A2/A5 guidance cues\n3,5\n. To ensure that soluble Neogenin ectodomain was selectively blocking RGM function, and not ephrin function, we tested the ligand binding specificity of these systems (\nFIG. 4D\n). It is clear that ephrinA2/5 bind to EphA3 but not Neogenin and that RGM binds to Neogenin but not EphA3. Thus, the blockade of stripe preference by soluble Neogenin demonstrates a crucial role for RGM/Neogenin signalling in determining retinotectal axon guidance in vitro.\n\n\nRGMs form high affinity complexes with Neogenin and Neogenin/RGM complexes play a significant role in retinotectal guidance systems. Since the Neogenin-related DCC functions as an axonal guidance receptor for Netrin-1, there is precedence for this family of receptor proteins mediating axonal guidance in vivo\n6,7\n. The interaction of RGM with Neogenin is of higher affinity than Netrin-1's interaction with Neogenin, and is specific amongst Netrin-binding proteins. Thus Neogenin's primary role in nervous system development is as a RGM receptor, with DCC serving as the primary Netrin receptor. It is of interest that both Neogenin and RGM (data not shown) are highly expressed in adult nervous system and in the injured nervous system, thus implicating them in adult neural regeneration. For example, RGM is localized at very high concentrations in brains at the lesion site in humans suffering form traumatic brain injury or from cerebral ischemia From approximately 1-7 days post injury or post cerebral ischemia, monocytes, lymphocytes, granulocytes and a few neurons express RGM. In subsequent stages, RGM is present on fibroblast-like cells, on reactive astrocytes and in fresh and mature scar tissue which forms at the lesion site.\n\n\nThe invention provides methods and compositions for identifying pharmacological agents useful in the diagnosis or treatment of mammalian, particularly human, neurological disease or injury. The methods rely on monitoring the interaction of a mammalian, particularly human, RGM and a corresponding Neogenin in the presence and absence of a candidate agent. A wide variety of assays can be used, including receptor activation assays and binding assays. Binding assays may monitor RGM binding to a domain of or a full-length receptor expressed on a cell, or in vitro protein-protein binding of a RGM to a full length or truncated receptor. In some embodiments, such in vitro screens involve the immobilization of one of the binding partners on a solid substrate.\n\n\nTypically, these assays involve a mixture comprising an isolated RGM and an isolated Neogenin capable of specifically binding said RGM. We have demonstrated that these mammalian gene products function as natural mammalian, and in particular, human, ligand-receptor complex. The general methods comprise the steps of: (1) forming a mixture comprising an isolated RGM, an isolated negoenin-1 receptor, and a candidate pharmacological agent; (2) incubating said mixture under conditions whereby, but for the presence of said candidate pharmacological agent, said RGM specifically binds said Neogenin at a first binding affinity; and. (3) detecting a second binding affinity of said RGM to said Neogenin, wherein a difference between said first and second binding affinity indicates that said candidate pharmacological agent is a lead compound for a pharmacological agent useful in the diagnosis or treatment of neurological disease or injury.\n\n\nThe term âmodulatorâ as employed herein relates to âinhibitorsâ as well as âactivatorsâ of RGM or Neogenin function. Most preferably said âmodulationâ is an inhibition, wherein said inhibition may be a partial or a complete inhibition. An inhibitor of RGM, for example, need not bind RGM but might inhibit RGM by interacting with Neogenin and inhibiting the RGM/Neogenin interaction. In addition, the inhibitor could inhibit RGM by inhibiting transcription, translation or processing (pre or post-translational) of RGM. Similarly, a modulator may mimic RGM function through binding to Neogenin without sharing homology to RGM.\n\n\nThe term, RGM amino acid sequence relates to the RGM polypeptides disclosed in WO 02/051438 (to which the following SEQ ID Nos. refer). In particular, SEQ ID NOs: 20 and 21 depict human RGM1. Human RGM1 has been localized on chromosome 15. Further, human RGMs comprise RGM2 and RGM3. RGM2 is depicted in SEQ ID NO: 23 (amino acid sequence) and is encoded by a nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 22. Human RGM2 has been localized on chromosome 5. Furthermore, human RGM3 is shown in appended SEQ ID NO: 25 (amino acid sequence) and encoded by a nucleotide sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO: 24. Human RGM3 is located on \nchromosome\n 1. Yet, as will be discussed herein below, said term relates also to further RGM homologues.\n\n\nThe term â(poly) peptideâ means, in accordance with the present invention, a peptide, a protein, or a (poly) peptide which encompasses amino acid chains of a given length, wherein the amino acid residues are linked by covalent peptide bonds.

Since the present invention provides for the use of amino acid sequences/polypeptides of RGM and Neogenin and their corresponding inhibitors and since the amino acid sequences of human and chicken RGM and Neogenin have been disclosed, the person skilled in the art is provided with the information to obtain RGM and Neogenin sequences from other species, like, inter alia, mouse, rat, pig, etc. The relevant methods are known in the art and may be carried out by standard methods, employing, inter alia, degenerate and non degenerate primers in PCR-techniques.\n\n\nBasic molecular biology methods are well known in the art and, e.g., described in Sambrook (Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)) and Ausubel, âCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biologyâ, Green Publishing Associates; and Wiley Interscience, N.Y.

The present invention, however, comprises also (poly)peptides deviating from wildtype amino acid sequences of human or chicken RGM and Neogenin, wherein said deviation may be, for example, the result of amino acid and/or nucleotide substitution(s), deletion(s), addition(s), insertion(s), duplication(s), inversion(s) and/or recombination(s) either alone or in combination. Those deviations may naturally occur or be produced via recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art. The term âvariationâ as employed herein also comprises âallelic variantsâ. These allelic variations may be naturally occurring allelic variants, splice variants as well as synthetically produced or genetically engineered variants.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 5 and 6\n present the amino acid sequence and nucleotide sequence, respectively, for Neogenin. For the purposes of this application, reference to âwildtypeâ Neogenin refers to this sequence although, as described herein, significant modifications of this sequence will not depart from the spirit of the invention.

Said nucleic acid probe itself may be a derivative of a nucleic acid molecule capable of hybridizing to said nucleic acid molecule or said derivative thereof. The term ânucleic acid moleculeâ further comprises peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) containing DNA analogs with amide backbone linkages (Nielsen, Science 254 (1991), 1497-1500). The term ânucleic acid moleculeâ which encodes a RGM (poly) peptide or a functional fragment/derivative thereof, in connection with the present invention, is defined either by (a) the specific nucleic acid sequences encoding said (poly) peptide specified in the present invention or (b) by nucleic acid sequences hybridizing under stringent conditions to the complementary strand of the nucleotide sequences of (a) and encoding a (poly) peptide deviating from the nucleic acid of (a) by one or more nucleotide substitutions, deletions, additions or inversions and wherein the nucleotide sequence shows at least 70%, more preferably at least 80% identity with the nucleotide sequence of said encoded RGM and Neogenin (poly)peptides having an amino acid sequence as defined herein and functions as a RGM or Neogenin (or a functional fragment/derivative thereof) as the case may be.\n\n\nThe term âmodulatorâ as employed herein also comprises the term âinhibitorâ, as mentioned herein above. The term comprises âmodulatorsâ of the RGM and Neogenin polypeptides and/or the RGM and Neogenin encoding nucleic acid molecule/genes. In context of this invention it is-also envisaged that said âmodulationâ may lead, when desired, to an activation of RGM and/or Neogenin.\n\n\nThe term âfunctional fragment or derivative thereofâ in context of the present invention and in relation to the RGM and Neogenin molecules comprises fragments of the RGM and Neogenin molecules defined herein having a length of at least 10, in another embodiment 25, in another embodiment at least 50, in another embodiment at least 75, and in another embodiment at least 100 amino acids depending on the application as would be known to one of skill in the art.\n\n\nFunctional fragments of the herein identified RGM and Neogenin molecules or RGM and Neogenin molecules of other species (homologous RGM and Neogenin) may be comprised in fusion and/or chimeric proteins. âFunctional fragmentsâ comprise RGM or Neogenin fragments (or their encoding nucleic acid molecules) which are able to replace RGM or Neogenin full length molecules in corresponding assays (as disclosed in, e. g. collapse and/or stripe assays) or may elucidate an anti-RGM or anti-Neogenin specific immune-response and/or lead to specific anti-RGM or anti-Neogenin antibodies. An example of such a âfunctional fragmentâ would be a fragment of RGM capable of binding Neogenin.

The term âderivativeâ also comprises chemical modifications. The term âderivativeâ as employed herein in context of the RGM and Neogenin molecule also comprises soluble RGM and Neogenin molecules which do not comprise any membrane anchorage.\n\n\nAs mentioned herein above, the present invention provides for the use of a modulator, preferably an inhibitor, of RGM molecules and/or their corresponding encoding polynucleotides/nucleic acid molecules for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for preventing, alleviating or treating various disorders of the nervous system, angiogenic disorders or disorders of the cardio-vascular system and malignancies of different etiology.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, said disorders of the nervous system comprise degeneration or injury of vertebrate nervous tissue, in particular neurodegenerative diseases, nerve fiber injuries and disorders related to nerve fiber losses.\n\n\nSaid neurodegenerative diseases may be selected from the group consisting of motorneuronal diseases (MND), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer disease, Parkinsons disease, progressive bulbar palsy, progressive muscular atrophy, HIV-related dementia and spinal muscular atrophy(ies), Down's Syndrome, Huntington's Disease, Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease, Gerstmann-Straeussler Syndrome, kuru, Scrapie, transmissible mink encephalopathy, other unknown prion diseases, multiple system atrophy, Riley-Day familial dysautonomia said nerve fiber injuries may be selected from the group consisting of spinal cord injury(ies), brain injuries related to raised intracranial pressure, trauma, secondary damage due to increased intracranial pressure, infection, infarction, exposure to toxic agents, malignancy and paraneoplastic syndromes and wherein said disorders related to nerve fiber losses may be selected from the group consisting of paresis of nervus facials, nervus medianus, nervus ulnaris, nervus axillaris, nervus thoracicus longus, nervus radialis and for of other peripheral nerves, and other aquired and non-aquired deseases of the (human) central and peripheral nervous system.\n\n\nThe above mentioned spinal cord and brain injuries not only comprise traumatic injuries but also relate to injuries caused by stroke, ischemia and the like. It is in particular envisaged that the inhibitors as defined herein below and comprising, inter alia, anti-RGM antibodies be employed in the medical art to stimulate nerve fiber growth in individuals, in particular in vertebrates, most preferably in humans.\n\n\nIn a more preferred embodiment of the present invention, the invention provides for the use of a modulator, preferably an inhibitor to RGM (or a functional fragment or derivative thereof) for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of disorders of the cardio-vascular system, wherein these disorders, e. g., comprise disorders of the blood-brain barrier, brain oedema, secondary brain damages due to increased intracranial pressure, infection, infarction, ischemia, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, exposure to toxic agents, malignancy, paraneoplastic syndromes.\n\n\nIt is envisaged, without being bound by theory, that RGM inhibitors may stimulate or allow surviving neurons to project collateral fibers into the diseased tissue, e. g. the ischemic tissue.\n\n\nRGM is expressed locally at the side of artificial transection of brain/spinal cord tissue in test animals (like rats), e. g., in the penumbra region surrounding an ischemic core of a human suffering focal ischemia in the temporal cortex. Furthermore, it is documented in the that RGM is, surprisingly, expressed in tissue(s) affected by traumatic brain injuries. The invention also relates to the use of a RGM polypeptide or a functional fragment or derivative thereof or the use of a polynucleotide encoding the same (polypeptides and polynucleotides as defined herein), wherein the above described disease or condition associated with seizures is epilepsy. An epilepsy is thereby characterized by an epileptic seizure as a convulsion or transient abnormal event experienced by the subject, e. g. a human patient, due to a paroxysmal discharge of (cerebral) neurons. The epileptic seizures comprise tonic seizures, tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal), myoclonic seizures, absence seizures as well as akinetic seizures. Yet, also comprised are in context of this invention simple partial seizures, e. g. Jacksonian seizures and seizures due to perinatal trauma and/or fetal anoxia. As mentioned herein below, the uses described herein relate in particular to the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of diseases/conditions associated with aberrant sprouting of nerve fibers, like epilepsy; see also Routbort, Neuroscience 94 (1999), 755-765.\n\n\nIn a even more preferred embodiment of the invention, the modulator, preferably the inhibitor of RGM (or of its functional fragment or derivative thereof or of its encoding nucleic acid molecule) is used for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the modification of neovascularization. Said modification may comprise activation as well as stimulation. It is in particular envisaged that said neovascularisation be stimulated and/or activated in diseased tissue, like inter alia, ischemic and/or infarctious tissue. Furthermore, it is envisaged that the RGM-inhibitors described herein may be employed in the regulation of the blood-brain barrier permeability.\n\n\nIt is furthermore envisaged that said modulators, preferably said inhibitors for RGM be employed in the alleviation, prevention and/or inhibition of progression of vascular plaque formation (e. g. artherosclerosis) in cardio-vascular, cerebo-vascular and/or nephrovascular diseases/disorders.\n\n\nFurthermore, the present invention provides for the use of a modulator, preferably an inhibitor of RGM as defined herein for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for remyelination. Therefore, the present invention provides for a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of demyelinating diseases of the CNS, like multiple sclerosis or of demyelinating diseases like peripheral neuropathy caused by diphteria toxin, Landry-Guillain-Barre-Syndrom, Elsberg-Syndrom, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and other polyneuropatias. A particular preferred inhibitor of RGM in this context is an antibody directed against RGM, e.g. an IgM antibody. It has previously be shown that certain IgMs bind to oligodendrocytes and thereby induce remyelination. IgM antibodies against RGM are known in the art and comprise e.g. the F3D4 described in the appended examples.\n\n\nIn addition the invention provides for the use of a RGM polypeptide as defined herein or of a functional fragment or derivative thereof or of a polynucleotide encoding said polypeptide or fragment or derivative for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for preventing, alleviating or treating diseases or conditions associated with the activity of autoreactive immune cells or with overactive inflammatory cells.\n\n\nMost preferably these cells are T-cells.\n\n\nFurthermore, the present invention relates to the use of a modulator, preferably an inhibitor or another RGM binding molecule of a RGM polypeptide or of a functional fragment or derivative thereof or of a polynucleotide encoding said polypeptide or of fragment/derivative thereof for modifying and/or altering the differentiation status of neuronal stem cells and/or their progenitors. Said stem cells are normally found in the subventricular zones of many brain regions. It is known that factors in the microenvironment of the brain dramatically influence the differentiation of undifferentiated stem cells. It is assumed that due to the characteristic expression of RGM in the subventricular layers of many different brain regions, this molecule could be a marker for stem cells. Furthermore, RGM inhibitors, like antibodies could be useful markers for stem cells. Most important in stem cell biology is the understanding of factors influencing their differentiation. It is therefore assumed that RGM inhibitors change the developmental fate of these cells.\n\n\nRGM is not only expressed in ischemic tissue but is also expressed in scar tissue surrounding (brain) lesions.\n\n\nIt is particularly preferred that the modulator, preferably the inhibitor of the RGM molecule (or its functional fragment or derivative) is an antibody or a fragment or a derivative thereof, is an aptamer, is a specific receptor molecule capable of interacting with a RGM polypeptide or with a functional fragment or derivative thereof, or is a specific nucleic acid molecule interacting with a polynucleotide encoding an RGM and/or the polypeptide.\n\n\nThe antibody to be used in context of the present invention can be, for example, polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies. Techniques for the production of antibodies are well known in the art and described, e. g. in Harlow and Lane âAntibodies, A Laboratory Manualâ, CSH Press, Cold Spring Harbor, 1988. The production of specific anti-RGM antibodies is further known in the art (see, e. g. Mutter (1996) loc. cit.) or described in the appended examples.\n\n\nThe term âantibodyâ as employed herein also comprises chimeric, single chain and humanized antibodies, as well as antibody fragments, like, inter alia, Fab fragments.\n\n\nAntibody fragments or derivatives further comprise F(abâ²)2, Fv or scFv fragments; see, for example, Harlow and Lane, loc. cit. Various procedures are known in the art and may be used for the production of such antibodies and/or fragments, see also appended examples. Thus, the (antibody) derivatives can be produced by peptidomimetics. Further, techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies (see, inter alia, U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778) can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies to polypeptide (s) of this invention. Also, transgenic animals may be used to express humanized antibodies to polypeptides of this invention. Most preferably, the antibody to be used in the invention is a monoclonal antibody, for example the F3D4 antibody described in the appended examples may be employed when an IgM is desired. The general methodology for producing, monoclonal antibodies is well-known and has been described in, for example, Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256 (1975), 494-496 and reviewed in J. G. R. Hurrel, ed., âMonoclonal Hybridoma Antibodies: Techniques and Applicationsâ, CRC Press Inc., Boco Raron, Fla. (1982), as well as that taught by L. T. Mimms et al., Virology 176 (1990), 604-619.\n\n\nPreferably, said antibodies (or inhibitors) are directed against functional fragments of the RGM polypeptide. As pointed out herein above and as documented in the appended examples, such functional fragments are easily deducible for the person skilled in the art and, correspondingly, relevant antibodies (or other inhibitors) may be produced.\n\n\nThe âmodulatorâ, preferably the âinhibitorâ as defined herein may also be an aptamer.\n\n\nIn the context of the present invention, the term âaptamerâ comprises nucleic acids such as RNA, ssDNA (ss=single stranded), modified RNA, modified ssDNA or PNAs which bind a plurality of target sequences having a high specificity and affinity.\n\n\nAptamers are well known in the art and, inter alia, described in Famulok, Curr. Op. Chem. Biol. 2 (1998), 320-327. The preparation of aptamers is well known in the art and may involve, inter alia, the use of combinatorial RNA libraries to identify binding sites (Gold, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 64 (1995), 763-797). Said other receptors may, for example, be derived from said antibody etc. by peptidomimetics.\n\n\nOther specific âreceptorâ molecules which may function as inhibitors of the RGM polypeptides are also comprised in this invention. Said specific receptors may be deduced by methods known in the art and comprise binding assays and/or interaction assays. These may, inter alia, involve assays in the ELISA-format or FRET-format.\n\n\nSaid âinhibitorâ may also comprise specific peptides binding to and/or interfering with RGM.\n\n\nFurthermore, the above recited âmodulatorâ, preferably âinhibitorâ may function at the level of RGM gene expression. Therefore, the inhibitor may be a (specific) nucleic acid molecule interacting with a polynucleotide encoding a RGM molecule (or a functional fragment or derivative thereof.) These inhibitors may, e. g., comprise anti sense nucleic acid molecules, small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) or ribozymes.\n\n\nThe nucleic acid molecule encoding RGM or Neogenin may be employed to construct appropriate anti-sense oligonucleotides or siRNA molecules.\n\n\nSaid anti-sense oligonucleotides are able to inhibit the function of wild-type (or mutant) RGM and Neogenin genes and comprise, for example, at least 15 nucleotides, at least 20 nucleotides, at least 30 nucleotides or at least 40 nucleotides.\n\n\nIn addition, ribozyme approaches are also envisaged for use in this invention.\n\n\nRibozymes may specifically cleave the nucleic acid molecule encoding RGM or Neogenin.\n\n\nIn the context of the present invention ribozymes comprise, inter alia, hammerhead ribozymes, hammerhead ribozymes with altered core sequences or deoxyribozymes (see, e. g., Santoro, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 (1997), 4262) and may comprise natural and in vitro selected and/or synthesized ribozymes.\n\n\nNucleic acid molecules according to the present invention which are complementary to nucleic acid molecules coding for proteins/ (poly) peptides regulating, causing or contributing to obesity and/or encoding a mammalian (poly) peptide involved in the regulation of body weight (see herein below) may be used for the construction of appropriate ribozymes (see, e. g., EP-\nB1\n 0 291 533, EP-\nA1\n 0 321 201, EP-\nA2\n 0 360 257) which specifically cleave nucleic acid molecules of the invention. Selection of the appropriate target sites and corresponding ribozymes can be done as described for example in Steinecke, Ribozymes, Methods in \nCell Biology\n 50, Galbraith, eds. Academic Press, Inc. (1995), 449-460.\n\n\nSaid âinhibitorâ may also comprise double-stranded RNAs, which lead to RNA mediated gene interference (see Sharp, Genes and Dev. 13 (1999), 139-141). Further potential inhibitors of RGM or Neogenin may be found and/or deduced by interaction assay and employing corresponding read-out systems. These are known in the art and comprise, inter alia, two hybrid screenings (as, described, inter alia, in EP-0 963 376, WO 98/25947, WO 00/02911), GST-pull-down columns, co-precipitation assays from cell extracts as described, inter alia, in Kasus-Jacobi, Oncogene 19 (2000), 20522059, âinteraction-trapâ systems (as described, inter alia, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,004,746), expression cloning (e. g. lambda gt11), phage display (as described, inter alia, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,541,109), in vitro binding assays and the like. Further interaction assay methods and corresponding read out systems are, inter alia, described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,525,490, WO 99/51741, WO 00/17221, WO 00/14271 or WO 00/05410.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the present invention provides for the use of the RGM amino acid sequence or of a functional fragment or derivative thereof or of a polynucleotide encoding said polypeptide or fragment or derivative for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for preventing or treating tumor growth or formation of tumor metastases.\n\n\nRGM (naturally isolated or recombinantly produced) and/or functional fragments thereof may be employed for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of neoplastic disorders, in particular of disorders related to tumor (cell) migration, metastasis and/or tumor invasion. Furthermore, it is envisaged that RGM inhibits undesired neovascularisation. Said neovascularisation, as an angiogenic disorder during neoplastic events, should be prevented in order to limit, inter alia, tumor growth.\n\n\nGrowth cones of neurons and (invasive) tumor cells secrete a cocktail of proteases (uPA, tPA, MNPs, etc.) in order to degrade extracellular matrix. Furthermore, similar mechanisms for adhesion and (cell) migration are employed by these cellular systems. RGM and/or its functional fragments may be employed to actively stimulate withdrawal of lamellipodia of tumor cells and/or to induce their collapse.\n\n\nIn addition the invention provides for the use of a RGM polypeptide as defined herein or of a functional fragment or derivative thereof or of a polynucleotide encoding said polypeptide or fragment or derivative for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for preventing, alleviating or treating diseases or conditions associated with the activity of autoreactive immune cells or with overactive inflammatory cells.\n\n\nMost preferably these cells are T-cells.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the invention provides for the use of a the RGM polypeptide h or of a functional fragment or derivative thereof or of a polynucleotide encoding said polypeptide or fragment or derivative for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of inflammation processes and/or allergies, for wound healing or for the suppression/alleviation of scar formation. Scar tissue is formed by invading cells, most importantly by fibroblasts and/or glial cells. Migration and adhesion of these cells are required to get to the lesion side. RGM or an active fragment/derivative could prevent accumulation of these cells in the lesion side, thereby preventing or slowing down scar formation. In inflammatory reactions cells migrate to the inflamed region and RGM or its active fragment/derivative prevent or reduce migration of these cells to the side of inflammation, thereby preventing overactive inflammatory reactions.\n\n\nIn context of the present invention, the term âpharmaceutical compositionâ also comprises optionally further comprising an acceptable carrier and/or diluent and/or excipient. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be particularly useful in preventing and/or treating pathological disorders in vertebrates, like humans. Said pathological disorders comprise, but are not limited to, neurological, neurodegenerative and/or neoplastic disorders as well as disorders associated with seizures, e. g. epilepsy. These disorders comprise, inter alia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS/SALS), ischemia, stroke, epilepsy, AIDS dementia and cancer.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical composition may also be used for prophylactic purposes.\n\n\nExamples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are well known in the art and include phosphate buffered saline solutions, water, emulsions, such as oil/water emulsions, various types of wetting agents, sterile solutions etc. Compositions comprising such carriers can be formulated by well known conventional methods. These pharmaceutical compositions can be administered to the subject at a suitable dose.\n\n\nAdministration of the suitable compositions may be effected by different ways, e. g., by intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, topical, intradermal, intranasal or intrabronchial administration. However, it is also envisaged that the pharmaceutical compositions are directly applied to the nervous tissue. The dosage regimen will be determined by the attending physician and clinical factors. As is well known in the medical arts, dosages for any one patient depends upon many factors, including the patient's size, body surface area, general health, age, sex, the particular compound to be administered, time and route of administration, and other drugs being administered concurrently. Pharmaceutical active matter may be present preferably, inter alia, in amounts between 1 ng and 1000 mg per dose, more preferably in amounts of 1 ng to 100 mg however, doses below or above this exemplary range are envisioned, especially considering the aforementioned factors. If the regimen is a continuous infusion, it should also be in the range of 1 ug to 10 mg units per kilogram of body weight per minute, respectively. Progress can be monitored by periodic assessment. The compositions of the invention may be administered locally or systemically. Administration will generally be parenterally, e. g., intravenously. The compositions of the invention may also be administered directly to the target site, e. g., by biolistic delivery to an internal or external target site or by catheter to a site in an artery. Preparations for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's, or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers (such as those based on Ringer's dextrose), and the like. Preservatives and other additives may also be present such as, for example, antimicrobials, anti-oxidants, chelating agents, and inert gases and the like. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may comprise further agents, depending on the intended use of the pharmaceutical composition. Such agents may be drugs acting on the central nervous system as well as on small, unmyelinated sensory nerve terminals (like in the skin), neurons of the peripheral nervous system of the digestive tract., etc.\n\n\nIt is also understood that the pharmaceutical composition as defined herein may comprise nucleic acid molecules encoding RGM and Neogenin (and/or functional fragments or derivatives thereof) or corresponding RGM and Neogenin inhibitors as defined herein. As mentioned herein-above, said inhibitors comprise, but are not limited to, antibodies, aptamer, RGM-interacting peptides as well as inhibitors interacting with the RGM-encoding polynucleotides.\n\n\nAccordingly, the present invention also provides for a method of treating, preventing and/or alleviating pathological disorders and conditions as defined herein, whereby said method comprises administering to a subject in need of such a treatment a pharmaceutical composition/medicament as defined herein. Preferably, said subject is a human.\n\n\nThe nucleic acid molecules may be particularly useful in gene therapy approaches and may comprise DNA, RNA as well as PNA. Said nucleic acid molecules may be comprised in suitable vectors, either inter alia, gene expression vectors. Such a vector may be, e. g., a plasmid, cosmid, virus, bacteriophage or another vector used e. g. conventionally in genetic engineering, and may comprise further genes such as marker genes which allow for the selection of said vector in a suitable host cell and under suitable conditions.\n\n\nFurthermore, the vectors may, in addition to the nucleic acid sequences encoding RGM and Neogenin or the corresponding inhibitors, comprise expression control elements, allowing proper expression of the coding regions in suitable host cells or tissues.\n\n\nSuch control elements are known to the artisan and may include a promoter, translation initiation codon, translation and insertion site for introducing an insert into the vector. Preferably, the nucleic acid molecule of the invention is operatively linked to said expression control sequences allowing expression in (eukaryotic) cells. Particularly preferred are in this context control sequences which allow for correct expression in neuronal cells and/or cells derived from nervous tissue.\n\n\nControl elements ensuring expression in eukaryotic cells are well known to those skilled in the art. As mentioned above, they usually comprise regulatory sequences ensuring initiation of transcription and optionally poly-A signals ensuring termination of transcription and stabilization of the transcript. Additional regulatory elements may include transcriptional as well as translational enhancers, and/or naturally-associated or heterologous promoter regions. Possible regulatory elements permitting expression in for example mammalian host cells comprise the CMV-HSV thymidine kinase promoter, SV40, RSV-promoter (Rous sarcoma virus), human elongation factor la-promoter, CMV enhancer, CaM-kinase promoter or SV40-enhancer. For the expression for example in nervous tissue and/or cells derived therefrom, several regulatory sequences are well known in the art, like the minimal promoter sequence of human neurofilament L (Charron, J. Biol. Chem 270 (1995), 25739-25745). Beside elements which are responsible for the initiation of transcription such regulatory elements may also comprise transcription termination signals, such as SV40-poly-A site or the tk-poly-A site, downstream of the polynucleotide. In this context, suitable expression vectors are known in the art such as Okayama-Berg cDNA expression vector pcDV1 Pharmacia), pRc/CMV, pcDNA1, pcDNA3 (In-Vitrogene, as used, inter alia in the appended examples), pSPORT1 (GIBCO BRL) or pGEMHE Promega). Beside the nucleic acid molecules defined herein, the vector may further comprise nucleic acid sequences encoding for secretion signals. Such sequences are well known to the person skilled in the art. Furthermore, depending on the expression system used leader sequences capable of directing the protein/(poly) peptide to a cellular compartment may be added to the coding sequence of the nucleic acid molecules of the invention and are well known in the art. The leader sequence (s) is (are) assembled in appropriate phase with translation, initiation and termination sequences, and preferably, a leader sequence capable of directing secretion of translated protein, or a part thereof.\n\n\nAs mentioned herein above, said vector may also be, besides an expression vector, a gene transfer and/or gene targeting vector. Gene therapy, which is based on introducing therapeutic genes into cells by ex-vivo or in-vivo techniques is one of the most important applications of gene transfer. Suitable vectors, vector systems and methods for in-vitro or in-vivo gene therapy are described in the literature and are known to the person skilled in the art; see, e. g., Giordano, Nature Medicine 2 (1996), 534-539; Schaper, Circ. Res. 79 (1996), 911-919; Anderson, Science 256 (1992), 808-813, Isner, Lancet 348 (1996), 370-374; Muhlhauser, Circ. Res. 77 (1995), 1077-1086; Wang, Nature Medicine 2 (1996), 714-716; WO 94/29469; WO 97/00957, Schaper, Current Opinion in Biotechnology 7 (1996), 635-640 Verma, Nature 389 (1997), 239-242 WO 94/29469, WO 97/00957, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,580,859, 589,66 or 4,394,448 and references cited therein.\n\n\nIn particular, said vectors and/or gene delivery systems are also described in gene therapy approaches in neurological tissue/cells (see, inter alia Blomer, J. Virology 71 (1997) 6641-6649) or in the hypothalamus (see, inter alia, Geddes, Front Neuroendocrinol. 20 (1999), 296-316 or Geddes, Nat. Med. 3 (1997), 1402-1404).\n\n\nFurther suitable gene therapy constructs for use in neurological cells/tissues are known in the art, for example in Meier (1999), J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 58,10991110. The nucleic acid molecules and vectors of the invention may be designed for direct introduction or for introduction via liposomes, viral vectors (e. g. adenoviral, retroviral), electroporation, ballistic (e. g. gene gun) or other delivery systems into the cell. Additionally, a baculoviral system can be used as eukaryotic expression system for the nucleic acid molecules described herein.\n\n\nThe terms âtreatmentâ, âtreatingâ and the like are used herein to generally mean obtaining a desired pharmacological and/or physiological effect. The effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing a disease or symptom thereof and/or may be therapeutic in terms of partially or completely curing a disease and/or adverse effect attributed to the disease. The term âtreatmentâ as used herein covers any treatment of a disease in a mammal, particularly a human, and includes: (a) preventing the disease from occurring in a subject which may be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibiting the disease, i. e. arresting its development; or (c) relieving the disease, i. e. causing regression of the disease.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the present invention provides for the use of a RGM or Neogenin polypeptide or of a functional fragment or derivative thereof or of a polynucleotide encoding said polypeptide or fragment or derivative as a marker of stem cells. Since it is envisaged that stem cells as well as their undifferentiated progenitor cells express RGM and Neogenin, RGM and Neogenin (and/or functional fragments or derivatives thereof) may be employed to influence the differentiation/differentiation pattern of said stem cells.\n\n\nIt is furthermore envisaged that antibodies directed against RGM or Neogenin or functional fragment(s)/derivative(s) thereof may be employed to influence the differentiation of (neuronal) stem cells and (neuronal) progenitor cells. It is particularly preferred that said antibodies (as well as other RGM-inhibitors and/or RGM-binding molecules) be employed to selectively label stem cells. Therefore these reagents may be employed as markers for stem cells. It is also envisaged that peptides or derivatives be employed in said purpose.\n\n\nIn a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the polypeptide and/or fragment thereof which comprises or has an RGM amino acid sequence to be used in accordance with their invention is a soluble, i. e. not membrane bound molecule.\n\n\nAs shown in Davis (1994), Science 266,816-819, ephrins, in particular A-ephrins, are not active in soluble, monomeric form. In contrast, soluble RGMs are active and may function without any membrane-attachment. RGM, in contrast to ephrins, is capable of self-formation of dimers and/or of the formation of higher aggregates. The invention also provides for the use of a RGM molecule or functional fragment or derivative thereof or of a polynucleotide encoding said polypeptide or a fragment or a derivative for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for alleviating, preventing and/or treating homeostatic and/or bleeding disorders and/or vascular damage.\n\n\nIt is envisaged, without being bound by theory, that RGMs may, due to their structural homology to von-Willebrand factor (vWF), be employed in the treatment of said disorders/diseases. Furthermore, it is envisaged that RGM may interact with von Willebrand factor and that said molecule, thereby, influences the activity of vWF.\n\n\nFurthermore, the inhibitors as defined herein should be employed in disorders where immune cells invade the brain, like multiple sclerosis, encephalomyelitis disseminata.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides for the use of an antibody or a fragment or a derivative thereof, or an aptamer, or a binding molecule capable of interacting with a polypeptide having or comprising the RGM or Neogenin amino acid sequence or with functional fragment or derivative thereof or of a nucleic acid molecule capable of interacting with a polynucleotide encoding said polypeptide or a fragment thereof for the preparation of a diagnostic composition for detecting neurological and/or neurodegenerative disorders or dispositions thereto.\n\n\nThe diagnostic composition may be used, inter alia, for methods for determining the expression of the nucleic acids encoding RGM and Neogenin polypeptides by detecting, inter alia, the presence of the corresponding mRNA which comprises isolation of RNA from a cell, contacting the RNA so obtained with a nucleic acid probe as described above under hybridizing conditions, and detecting the presence of mRNAs hybridized to the probe.\n\n\nFurthermore, corresponding mutations and/or alterations may be detected.\n\n\nFurthermore, RGM and Neogenin (poly) peptides can be detected with methods known in the art, which comprise, inter alia, immunological methods, like, ELISA or Western blotting.\n\n\nThe diagnostic composition of the invention may be useful, inter alia, in detecting the prevalence, the onset or the progress of a disease related to the aberrant expression of a RGM or Neogenin polypeptide. Accordingly, the diagnostic composition of the invention may be used, inter alia, for assessing the prevalence, the onset and/or the disease status of neurological, neurodegenerative and/or inflammatory disorders, as defined herein above. It is also contemplated that anti-RGM or anti-Neogenin antibodies, aptamers etc. and compositions comprising such antibodies, aptamers, etc. may be useful in discriminating the stage(s) of a disease.\n\n\nThe diagnostic composition optionally comprises suitable means for detection. The nucleic acid molecule(s), vector(s), antibody(ies), (poly)peptide(s), described above are, for example, suitable for use in immunoassays in which they can be utilized in liquid phase or bound to a solid phase carrier. Examples of well-known carriers include glass, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, polyethylene, polycarbonate, dextran, nylon, amyloses, natural and modified celluloses, polyacrylamides, agaroses, and magnetite. The nature of the carrier can be either soluble or insoluble for the purposes of the invention.\n\n\nSolid phase carriers are known to those in the art and may comprise polystyrene beads, latex beads, magnetic beads, colloid metal particles, glass and/or silicon chips and surfaces, nitrocellulose strips, membranes, sheets, duracytes and the walls of wells of a reaction tray, plastic tubes or other test tubes. Suitable methods of immobilizing nucleic acid molecule(s), vector(s), host(s), antibody(ies), (poly)peptide(s), fusion protein(s) etc. on solid phases include but are not limited to ionic, hydrophobic, covalent interactions and the like. Examples of immunoassays which can utilize said compounds of the invention are competitive and non-competitive immunoassays in either a direct or indirect format. Commonly used detection assays can comprise radioisotopic or non-radioisotopic methods.\n\n\nExamples of such immunoassays are the radioimmunoassay (RIA), the sandwich (immunometric assay) and the Northern or Southern blot assay. Furthermore, these detection methods comprise, inter alia, IRMA (Immune Radioimmunometric Assay), EIA (Enzyme Immuno Assay), ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immuno Assay), FIA fluorescent immune Assay), and CLIA (Chemioluminescent Immune Assay).\n\n\nFurthermore, the diagnostic compounds of the present invention may be are employed in techniques like FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) assays.\n\n\nThe nucleic acid sequences encoding RGMs of other species as well as variants of RGMs are easily deducible from the information provided herein. These nucleic acid sequences are particularly useful, as pointed out herein above, in medical and/or diagnostic setting, but they also provide for important research tools. These tools may be employed, inter alia, for the generation of transgenic animals which overexpress or suppress RGMs or wherein the RGM gene is silenced and/or deleted. Furthermore, said sequences may be employed to detect and/or elucidate RGM interaction partners and/or molecules binding to and/or interfering with RGMs. The same holds true for nucleic acid sequences encoding Neogenin.\n\n\nAll publications and patent applications cited in this specification are herein incorporated by reference as if each individual publication or patent application were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings of this invention that certain changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the appended claims.\n\n\nThe following Examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation:\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nAn expression vector containing a vector-derived signal sequence, the chick RGM sequence from aa 28 to 403 fused to AP and a Myc His tag was constructed. This plasmid was stably transfected into HEK293 cells and secreted RGM-AP protein was purified on a Ni-containing resin. Quantitative binding assays to transfected COS-7 cells were conducted as described for Nogo-AP binding\n13\n. To isolate a cDNA encoding a chick RGM-AP binding protein, a mouse adult brain cDNA library (Origene) was screened with 10 nM RGM-AP, as described previously for Nogo-66-AP\n13\n. Mouse RGM-1-AP (Accession number BC023870) and RGM-2-AP (AK080819) were prepared by identical methods as for chick RGM-AP. Mouse RGM-3 is encoded by BC022603. The mouse Unc5H1 and Unc5H3 expression plasmids were derived from EST clones (BI818609 and BI769500) and the pCMV-SPORT6 vector. Truncated versions of chick Neogenin-1 were expressed using the pcDNA3.1-MycHis vector. The soluble ectodomain protein contains aa residues 1-1027 of chick Neogenin-1, the ecto+TM protein contains residues 1-1115 and the 6ÃFNIII+TM protein contains aa 400-11.15. A rabbit anti-mouse neogenin-1 antibody was emploed for immunoblots (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.).\n\n\nChick retinal axons and tectal membranes were prepared for stripe assays as described\n10,11\n. Soluble ectodomain of chick Neogenin-1 (1-1027) was expressed with a carboxyl MycHis tag as a secreted protein in HEK293 cells and purified on a Ni containing resin. Dialyzed protein was added to the stripe assay cultures. Recombinant RGM-AP-MycHis and ephrinA2-Fc or ephrinA5-Fc stripes were prepared using an initial coating of poly-L-lysine coated coverslips with anti-Myc antibody or anti-Human IgG antibody as described for other proteins\n10,11,14\n.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nLigand Screening of Transfected COS Cells.\n\n\nI. Prepare the Ligand\n\n\nExpression Construct: cDNA encoding the targeted RGM is tagged with the Fcâportion of human IgG and subcloned into a 293 expression vector (pCEP4: In Vitrogen).\n\n\nTransfection: 293 EBNA cells are transfected (CaPO.sub.4 method) with the RGM expression construct. After 24 h recovery, transfected cells are selected with G418 (geneticin, 250 ug/ml, Gibco) and hygromycin (200 ug/ml). Once the selection process is complete, cells are maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles medium (DME)/10% FCS under selection.\n\n\nPreparation of Conditioned Medium: Serum-containing media is replaced with Optimem with glutamax-1 (Gibco) and 300 ng/ml heparin (Sigma), and the cells are conditioned for 3 days. The media is collected and spun at 3,000.times.g for 10 minutes. The supernatant is filtered (0.45 um) and stored with 0.1% azide at 4.degree. C. for no more than 2 weeks.\n\n\nII. Prepare Truncated Receptor (Positive Control)\n\n\nExpression Construct: cDNA encoding a corresponding Neogenin deletion mutant comprising the extracellular domain (truncated immediately N-terminal to the transmembrane region) is subcloned into a 293 expression vector (pCEP4: In Vitrogen).\n\n\nTransfection: 293 EBNA cells are transfected (CaPO.sub.4 method) with the receptor mutant expression construct. After 24 h recovery, transfected cells are selected with G418 (geneticin, 250 ug/ml, Gibco) and hygromycin (200 ug/ml). Once the selection process is complete, cells are maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles medium (DME)/10% FCS under selection.\n\n\nPreparation of Conditioned Medium: Serum-containing media is replaced with Optimem with glutamax-1 (Gibco) and 300 ng/ml heparin (Sigma), and the cells are conditioned for 3 days. The media is collected and spun at 3,000.times.g for 10 minutes. The supernatant is filtered (0.45 um) and stored with 0.1% azide at 4.degree. C. for no more than 2 weeks.\n\n\nIII. Transfect COS Cells\n\n\nSeed COS cells (250,000) on 35 mm dishes in 2 ml DME/10% FCS. 18-24 h later, dilute 1 ug of netrin receptor-encoding DNA (cDNA cloned into pMT21 expression vector) into 200 ul serum-free media and add 6 ul of Lipofectamine (Gibco). Incubate this solution at room temperature for 15-45 min.\n\n\nWash the \ncells\n 2Ã with PBS. Add 800 ul serum-free media to the tube containing the lipid-DNA complexes. Overlay this solution onto the washed cells.\n\n\nIncubate for 6 h. Stop the reaction by adding 1 ml DMA/20% FCS. Refeed cells. Assay cells 12 hr later.\n\n\nIV. Ligand Binding Assay\n\n\nWash plates of \ntransfected COS cells\n 1Ã with cold PBS (plus Ca/Mg)/1% goat serum.\n\n\nAdd 1 ml conditioned media neat and incubate 90 min at room temp.\n\n\nWash plates 3Ã with PBS (plus Ca/Mg). On the 4th wash, add 1 \nml\n 50% methanol to 1 ml PBS. Then add 1 ml methanol. Evacuate and add 1 ml methanol.\n\n\n \nWash\n 1Ã with PBS. Wash 1X PBS/1% goat serum.\n\n\nAdd secondary antibody (1-to-2,000 anti-human Fc conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Jackson Lab)) in PBS/1% goat serum. Incubate 30-40 mlin room ternp.\n\n\nWash 3Ã with PBS. \nWash\n 1Ã alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl). Prepare alkaline phosphatase reagents: 4.5 ul/ml NBT and 3.5 ul/ml BCIP (Gibco) in alkaline phosphatase buffer.\n\n\nIncubate 10-30 min, quench with 20 mM EDTA in PBS. Cells that have bound RGM are visible by the presence of a dark purple reaction product.\n\n\nIn parallel incubations, positive controls are provided by titrating RGM binding with serial dilutions of the mutant receptor conditioned medium.\n\n\nV. Results: Binding of RGM to Neogenin\n\n\nCell expressing mammalian RGM were shown to bind Neogenin. No reactivity was observed with control COS cells or with receptor-expressing COS cells in the presence of the secondary antibody but in the absence of the RGM-Fc fusion.\n\n\nBinding was observed to receptor-expression cells using a construct in which RGM is fused directly to alkaline phosphatase, for which a secondary antibody is not required. Neogenin deletion mutants titrate the RGM-receptor binding, serving as a positive control for inhibition assays.\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nComparison of axonal guidance phenotypes in Neogenin, DCC, Netrin, and RGM null mice.\n\n\nIn order to assess the functional role of the RGM/Neogenin system in neurological outcome after brain or spinal cord injury, studies in mice with targeted gene deletions are studied. These mice are created using mouse Embryonic Stem (ES) cells selected to contain disruptions of the endogenous genes of interest. The ES cells with gene disruptions is injected into mouse blastocysts to derive chimeric animals and then the targeted mutation are bred to homozygosity. In mice lacking Neogenin or RGM1 or RGM2 or RGM3 functional protein, various mouse models for human neurological disease are studied. For example, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) is created in mice using an intraluminal thread by standard methods. This MCAO produces a stroke in the brain and functional deficits in behavior. The recovery of mice from such injury in wild type and gene targeted lines is compared. The RGM/Neogenin interaction limits recovery from injury. Parallel studies of brain trauma and spinal cord traums are also made with mice lacking Neogenin or RGM1 or RGM2 or RGM3 function. Brain trauma is created by fluid percussion and spinal cord injury is created by either transection or by contusion. Improved recovery of mouse behavior after these traumatic lesions demonstrates the role of the RGM/Neogenin interaction in limiting recovery from CNS damage. Agents demonstrated to be inhibitory to the RGM/Neogenin interaction similarly improve recovery in wild-type mice exposed to brain trauma/spinal cord injury etc.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.

Its scientific name is \"Agaricus blazei Murrill\" and its name is \"Kagariharatake\". Himematsutake has long been called the âGod's Mushroomâ in the field, and it has been known that Himematsutake has a preventive / improving effect on cancer, infectious diseases, diabetes, etc. Extracts of fruiting bodies and fungal bodies are eaten as health foods. By the way, the effect is generally such as Î²-D-glucan, which is a high molecular polysaccharide contained in the fruit body of Himematsutake, glucomannan protein polysaccharide (ATOM) contained in mycelia, mannan protein complex It is thought to be due to the action of the body (AB-FP). However, it is suggested that various active ingredients such as lectin and polyphenol oxidase are effective, and that various active ingredients such as steroid apoptosis-inducing action are acting in combination. (For example, Patent Documents 1-6) \n In addition, it has been reported that the water-soluble complex component extracted from the fruit body and the fruit body of Himematsutake has an anti-arteriosclerotic action, and this action is due to the protein polysaccharide complex component of the extract. It has been suggested. (Patent Document 7) \n As described above, the extract of Himematsutake is known to have various pharmacological actions and has great potential for use in the treatment of diseases such as cancer and adult diseases. The body of is not revealed. In order to use Himematsutake as a medicine, not as a health food, it is necessary to elucidate its pharmacological action at the substance level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nãã¨ããã§ãå¾æ¥ãããã¨ã¹ãã­ã²ã³ã®æ¬ ä¹ã«ãã£ã¦ãå¥³æ§ã®æ´å¹´æéå®³ãæ§ããªç¾æ£ãå¼ãèµ·ãããããã¨ãç¥ããã¦ãããå·ä½çã«ã¯ãä¾ãã°ãèç¸®æ§è£çãªã©ã®æ³å°¿çæ®å¨éå®³ãåç«èºçãåç«èºè¥å¤§çãéª¨ç²é¬çãåèç¡¬åãè¨æ¶éå®³ãã¢ã«ããã¤ãã¼çãè¡æ æ§ç¾æ£ãªã©ãæããããã\n\n\nBy the way, it has been conventionally known that estrogen deficiency causes women's menopause and various diseases.

It is pointed out that it is. Against this background, in recent years, attention has been paid to a method for treating arteriosclerosis using a plant-derived estrogen-like substance such as soybean isoflavone instead of directly using estrogen for treatment. In this way, interest in useful substances in foods is increasing, and health foods that can be taken safely without any side effects are drawing attention.

As a similar example, the estrogenic action of soybean isoflavone is known. One of the reasons why soy isoflavones are recognized as an active ingredient in health foods is that they not only have the same effect as estrogen, but also do not have the risk of strong carcinogenesis (including cancer cell growth) that estrogen exhibits . For example, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare's Food Safety Commission report âBasic concept of safety assessment of foods for specified health use containing soy isoflavonesâ (May 2006: see attached file) states that â4.2.3.1 Cancer etc. \"In addition, there is a report that intake of soy isoflavone shows an anti-estrogenic effect on the development of breast cancer in the in vitro test\" (page 35).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nããã®ããã«ãæ¬çºæã®è¬å¤ã¯ãå¤§è±ã¤ã½ãã©ãã³ã®å ´åã¨åæ§ã«ãã¨ã¹ãã­ã²ã³æ§ä½ç¨ãæããã¨ã¨ãã«ãã¨ã¹ãã­ã²ã³ã®æã¤æ¬ ç¹ãæãã¦ããªããã¨ãããå¯ä½ç¨ã®æãããªããã¨ã¹ãã­ã²ã³ã®æ¬ ä¹ã«ã¨ããªãéå®³ãç¾æ£ãæããæ£èã«æä¸ãããã¨ã§ãéå®³ãç¾æ£ã®æ²»çã¾ãã¯äºé²ãããã¨ãã§ããã\n\n\nThus, the drug of the present invention has an estrogen-like action as in the case of soy isoflavone and does not have the disadvantages of estrogen, so there is no risk of side effects, and disorders associated with estrogen deficiency, By administering to a patient having a disease, the disorder or disease can be treated or prevented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nãããã§ããã¨ã¹ãã­ã²ã³ã®æ¬ ä¹ã«ã¨ããªãéå®³ãã¨ã¯ãä¾ãã°ãæ´å¹´æéå®³ãæããããæ¬çºæã®è¬å¤ã«ããã°ãæ´å¹´æéå®³ã«ãããèªå¾ç¥çµå¤±èª¿çç¶ï¼é¡é¢ç´æ½®ãçºæ±ãå·ãæ§ãç¡ç éå®³ãåæ¸ãé ­çãªã©ï¼ãç²¾ç¥çç¶ï¼æãã¤ãç²¾ç¥ä¸å®å®ãè¨æ¶åæ¸éãªã©ï¼ããã®ä»ã®çç¶ï¼è©ãããé¢ç¯çãè¹çãé£æ¬²ä¸æ¯ãæç²å´æ§ãªã©ï¼ï¼ååæ­£ä¸ä»ç£ä¿®ï¼ããªã³ã·ãã«ç£ç§å©¦äººç§å­¦ï¼ï¼æ¹è¨çãã¡ãã£ã«ã«ãã¥ã¼ç¤¾ã2001ï¼ãæ¹åãããã¨ãã§ãããã¾ãããã¨ã¹ãã­ã²ã³ã®æ¬ ä¹ã«ã¨ããªãç¾æ£ãã«ã¯ãä¾ãã°ãèç¸®æ§è£çãªã©ã®æ³å°¿çæ®å¨éå®³ãåç«èºçãåç«èºè¥å¤§çãéª¨ç²é¬çãåèç¡¬åãè¨æ¶éå®³ãã¢ã«ããã¤ãã¼çãè¡æ æ§ç¾æ£ãªã©ãå«ã¾ããã\n\n\nHere, the âdisorder associated with estrogen deficiencyâ includes, for example, climacteric disorder, and according to the agent of the present invention, autonomic dysfunction due to climacteric disorder (facial flushing, sweating, coldness, sleep disorder, palpitations) , Headache, etc.), psychiatric symptoms (depression, mental instability, decreased memory, etc.), other symptoms (stiff shoulders, joint pain, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fatigue, etc.) (supervised by Masakazu Sakamoto et al .: Principal Obstetrics and \nGynecology\n 1 Revised version, Medical View, 2001). âDiseases associated with estrogen deficiencyâ include, for example, genitourinary disorders such as atrophic vaginitis, prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, osteoporosis, arteriosclerosis, memory impairment, Alzheimer's disease, thrombotic disease, etc. .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nãã¾ããæ¬çºæã®å¥åº·è£å©é£åã¯ãç®èã®ã·ããã·ã¯ãªã©ã®æ¹åããè±è¸ãªã©ã®ç¾å®¹ç®çã«ãæç¨ã§ããã\n\n\nIn addition, the health supplement of the present invention is useful for the improvement of skin spots, wrinkles and the like, and beauty purposes such as breast augmentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nãããã¦ãå·ä½çã«ã¯ãæ¬çºæã®è¬å¤ãå¥åº·è£å©é£åã¯ãä¸è¨å¼ï¼ï¼©ï¼ã§è¡¨ããããã¬ãã§ã«ãã£ã³ï¼¡é¡ãæå¹æåã¨ãã¦å«æãã¦ããã\n\n\nSpecifically, the drug and health supplement of the present invention contain Brefeldin A represented by the following formula (I) as an active ingredient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nããã¬ãã§ã«ãã£ã³ï¼¡é¡ã¯ãï¼åã®ä¸æç­ç´ ï¼ï¼ä½ãï¼ä½ãï¼ä½ãï¼ä½ãï¼ä½åã³ï¼ï¼ä½ã®ç­ç´ åå­ï¼ãæãã¦ãããããã¤ãã®ç°æ§ä½ãå­å¨ãã¦ãããä¾ãã°ãä¸è¨å¼ï¼ï¼©ï¼©ï¼ã§è¡¨ãããç«ä½éç½®ãæãããã¬ãã§ã«ãã£ã³ï¼¡åã³ãã®ã¨ãã¼ãã¼ã§ããï¼ï¼epiï¼ãã¬ãã§ã«ãã£ã³ï¼¡ãï¼ï¼ï¼ï¼epiï¼ãã¬ãã§ã«ãã£ã³ï¼¡ç­ãç¥ããã¦ããï¼J.Chem.Soc.,1,Â 2387Â (1982);Â Angew.Â Chem.Â Int.Â Ed.Â Engl.,Â 23,Â 145Â (1984)ï¼ããããã®ç«ä½ç°æ§ä½ã®ä¸­ã§ãä¸è¨å¼ï¼ï¼©ï¼©ï¼ã§è¡¨ããããã¬ãã§ã«ãã£ã³ï¼¡ãæãå¥½ã¾ããã\n\n\nBrefeldin A has 6 asymmetric carbons (carbon atoms at 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 15), and several isomers exist.

In solid culture, since the culture time is long and the extraction process is complicated, it is preferable to use a liquid culture method in consideration of the convenience of operation. Examples of the liquid medium include glycol, saccharose, and maltose. , Water sources such as water candy, dextrin, sucrose, starch, sugar, nitrogen sources such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, sodium nitrate, natural complex nutrient sources such as malt extract, yeast extract, corn staple, phosphate, agnesium A normal sterilized liquid medium adjusted to around pH 6.0 comprising an inorganic salt such as a salt or potassium salt and other trace elements can be used. Organic and inorganic substances that help the growth of bacteria and promote the production of Brefeldin A can also be added to the medium. When inoculated with the seeds of Japanese matsutake mushrooms in the medium, the mycelium grows when cultured under aerobic conditions under aerobic conditions while preventing contamination of bacteria for about 15 to 25 days at a temperature of about 30 Â° C. The mycelium of matsutake mushroom can be obtained by centrifuging or filtering the culture system in stages. Production of Brefeldin A by the mycelia of Himematsutake varies depending on the culture medium and culture conditions, but in the agar surface culture method, which is a solid culture method in a flask, the accumulation usually reaches its maximum within 7 to 21 days. . Therefore, it is preferable to stop the culture when the accumulation amount of brefeldin A in the mycelium reaches the maximum. And the obtained mycelium can also be made into a powder form by freeze-drying, for example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nããã®ããã«ãã¦å¾ããããã¡ããã¿ã±ã®èç³¸ä½åã³ï¼åã¯ãã®å¦çç©ããæº¶åªæ½åºç©ãå¾ãããã®æº¶åªæ½åºç©ã«ã¯ããã¬ãã§ã«ãã£ã³ï¼¡é¡ãå«ã¾ãããæº¶åªã¯ãæ°´ãç±æ°´åã¯å«æ°´ææ©æº¶åªã«ãã£ã¦è¡ããã¨ãã§ããããã®å ´åãä¾ãã°ãç±æ°´ã¨ãã¦ã¯40âä»¥ä¸ã®ãã®ãå¥½ã¾ããã¯60âä»¥ä¸ã®ãã®ãæããããå«æ°´ææ©æº¶åªã¨ãã¦ã¯ã20ï½60ééï¼ç¨åº¦ã®ä½ç´ã¢ã«ã³ã¼ã«ãå¥½ã¾ããã¯ã¨ãã«ã¢ã«ã³ã¼ã«ãå«æããæ°´æº¶æ¶²ãæããããã\n\n\nA solvent extract is obtained from the mycelium of Himematsutake thus obtained and / or a processed product thereof.

It was thought that this would promote recovery of vascular damage and prevent and improve arteriosclerosis. \n Next, we examined the effects of daily administration of Japanese apricot powder on serum oxidized LDL levels in hyperlipidemic patients. Blood was collected from hyperlipidemic patients (n = 8) and healthy individuals (n = 6) who had been ingested for 1 year, and the serum oxidized LDL level was measured. Thereafter, the hyperlipidemic patient stopped taking 4 months and then resumed taking 3 months again. Blood samples were collected before and after daily administration of Japanese red pine powder (250 mg / day) for 1 year, and the oxidized LDL level in the serum was measured by sandwich ELISA. The oxidized LDL fraction in serum was separated from various blood components by ultracentrifugation, and the protein concentration was determined using BCA reagent (BioRad, Hercules, Calif., USA). After adding 100 Î¼l of diluted LDL (50 Î¼g / ml) fraction to microtiter wells pre-coated with anti-oxidized phosphatidylcholine monoclonal antibody (DLH3; 0.5 Î¼g / well), wells were washed thoroughly The oxidized LDL bound to the wells was detected using an anti-apo B protein polyclonal antibody as a primary antibody and a secondary antibody bound to alkaline phosphatase. Finally, the wells were incubated with paranitrophenyl phosphate (1 mg / ml, dissolved in 1 M triethanolamine buffer (pH 9.8)) for 10-30 minutes at 37 Â° C.

Then, an oxidation reaction was carried out with 5 Î¼M copper sulfate at 37 Â° C. for 3 hours, and after the reaction, the amount of TBARS (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance) was measured. As a result, as shown in FIG. 3, it was clarified that Japanese red pine powder does not promote LDL lipid peroxidation in vitro. \n Therefore, it was suggested that the inhibitory effect of the oxidized LDL level in the serum by administration of the Japanese pine agar powder is due to the removal of oxidized LDL from the serum by specific cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nãï¼å®æ½ä¾ï¼ï¼å ç¶åèã«ããããã¡ããã¿ã±ç²è¬ã®å½±é¿ã®åç«çµç¹åå­¦çãªåæ\n\nï¼ï¼ï¼è©¦é¨æ¹æ³\n\nãé«èèªè¡ã®è¿äº¤ç³»æ¥æ¬ç½ã¦ãµã®ã®2ã¤ã®ç¾¤ï¼ã°ã«ã¼ãIããã³IIï¼ãç¨ããåèç¡¬åã«é¢ããããã¡ããã¿ã±ç²è¬ã®å½±é¿ãèª¿ã¹ãã\n\n<Example 4> Immunohistochemical analysis of the effect of Japanese red pine powder on coronary arteries (1) Test method Using two groups of inbred Japanese white rabbits (group I and II) with hyperlipidemia, arteriosclerosis The effects of Japanese pine bamboo powder were investigated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nãç´2.5kgã®è¿äº¤ç³»ç½ã¦ãµã®ï¼ï¼å¹ããä»¥ä¸ã®ï¼ã¤ã®ã°ã«ã¼ãã«ã©ã³ãã ã«åããã\n\nã»ã°ã«ã¼ãIï¼ãã¡ããã¿ã±ç²è¬æä¸ç¡ãï¼n=8ï¼\n\nã»ã°ã«ã¼ãIIï¼ãã¡ããã¿ã±ç²è¬æä¸æãï¼n=6ï¼\n\nã»ã³ã³ãã­ã¼ã«ï¼ç¡å¦çç¾¤ï¼n=2ï¼\n\nãæåã«ã°ã«ã¼ãIããã³IIã®ã¦ãµã®ã®å¤§åèãããã«ã¼ã³ãããã«ãã¼ãã«ãä½¿ã£ã¦æå·ããããã®å¾ããã¹ã¦ã®ã¦ãµã®ã¯å¥ãã«é£¼è²ããããããã®ã¦ãµã®ã¯é£ç©ï¼100g/æ¥ï¼ã¨æ°´ãèªç±æåã§ããããã«ãããã°ã«ã¼ãIããã³IIã®ã¦ãµã®ç¾¤ã«ã12é±ã®éãé«ã³ã¬ã¹ãã­ã¼ã«å«æé£¼æï¼»0.5%ã®ã³ã¬ã¹ãã­ã¼ã«ããCLEAÂ RabbitÂ DietÂ CR-3ï¼ã¯ãªã¢ç¤¾ï¼ã«å ãããã®ï¼½ãä¸ãããæ¬¡ã®23é±éã¯ãã°ã«ã¼ãIIã®ã¦ãµã®ç¾¤ã«ã¯0.01%ã®ãã¡ããã¿ã±ç²è¬ï¼3.3mg/kgï¼äººéã®æåéã¨åãæç®æ¯çã«ãããã®ï¼ãå«ãCR-3é£¼æãä¸ããããã°ã«ã¼ãIã®ã¦ãµã®ç¾¤ã«ã¯éå¸¸ã®CR-3é£¼æãä¸ãããã³ã³ãã­ã¼ã«ã®ã¦ãµã®ç¾¤ã«ã¯ã35é±éã«ãããCR-3é£¼æã®ã¿ãä¸ããããã®å®é¨æéã®çµããã«ã¯ãã°ã«ã¼ãIã¨ã°ã«ã¼ãã®IIã®ã¦ãµã®ã®ééã¯ãã¨ãã«ç´3.5kgã«ãªã£ã¦ãããç¬¬12é±ã¨ç¬¬35é±ã®çµããã«ãã¦ãµã®ã®ç¼é¨åèã®åã¿ã¨ãä¸è¡è¹é¨å¤§åèã®ç¼é¨åèã®åã¿ãè¶é³æ³¢ã¨ã³ã¼ãä½¿ã£ã¦æ¸¬å®ãããæä¸æéçµäºå¾ï¼35é±å¾ï¼ã®ã¦ãµã®ã¯ãã³ãã¿ã¼ã«ï¼50mg/kgï¼ã§éº»éããè§£åãã¦ãã®å¾ã®å®é¨ã«ç¨ããã\n\nSixteen inbred white rabbits of about 2.5 kg were randomly divided into the following three groups. \nã» Group I: Japanese pine mushroom powder not administered (n = 8) \nã» Group II: Himematsutake powder administered (n = 6) \nã» Control: Untreated group (n = 2) \n Initially Group A and II rabbit aorta were injured using a balloon tip catheter.

Group I and II rabbit groups were fed a high cholesterol-containing diet [0.5% cholesterol added to CLEA Rabbit Diet CR-3 (Clear)] for 12 weeks. For the next 23 weeks, Group II rabbits were given a CR-3 diet containing 0.01% Japanese matsutake powder (3.3 mg / kg, equivalent to human consumption). The rabbit group was fed with normal CR-3 diet. The control rabbit group received only CR-3 diet for 35 weeks. At the end of the experiment, the Group I and Group II rabbits weighed approximately 3.5 kg. At the end of the 12th and 35th weeks, the thickness of the rabbit intima and the thickness of the intima of the descending abdominal aorta were measured using ultrasound echo.

This finding suggests that Japanese red pine mushroom powder does not change the thickness of the descending aortic intima as a whole but acts directly on the arteriosclerotic site.

Immunohistochemical staining with RAM11 showed significant macrophage proliferation in Group I rabbits (FIG. 5A) compared to Group II rabbits (FIG. 5K). For Î±-smooth muscle actin, type I, III, IV collagen, Ki67 (MIB-1), BAX, LOX-1 and CD36, immunostaining for the intima was good, but group I (FIG. 5B-I ) And Group II rabbits (Fig. 5L-S) were not found. TUNEL analysis of the intima of the aorta revealed that there were more cells showing apoptosis in group I rabbits (FIG. 5J) than in group II rabbits (FIG. 5T). This indicates that the damage to cells associated with arteriosclerosis was more prominent in Group I rabbits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nãï¼å®æ½ä¾ï¼ï¼ãã¡ããã¿ã±èç³¸ä½æ½åºç©ã®ã¨ã¹ãã­ã²ã³æ§ä½ç¨\n\næãã¯ããã¡ããã¿ã±èç³¸ä½æ½åºç©ã«ããèç®¡æå®³ãæ¹åããã¡ã«ããºã ãã¨ã¹ãã­ã²ã³æ§ä½ç¨ã«ãããã®ã§ã¯ãªããã¨èããä¹³çç±æ¥ã®MCF-7ç´°èã®å¢æ®ã«å¯¾ãããã¡ããã¿ã±æ½åºç©ã®å½±é¿ãæ¤è¨ããã\n\nï¼ï¼ï¼SulforhodamineÂ Bï¼SRBï¼æ¯è²åæè©ä¾¡\n\nãããä¹³çç±æ¥MCF-7ç´°èã¯ãJCRBÂ CellÂ Bankï¼å½ç«å»è¬åé£åè¡çç ç©¶æãæ±äº¬ï¼ããå¥æããRPMIÂ 1640å¹å°ï¼ã¤ã³ããã­ã¸ã§ã³ï¼ç±³å½ã«ãªãã©ã«ãã¢å·ã«ã¼ã«ã¹ãããï¼ã§ã5%ã®äºé¸åç­ç´ ã®å­å¨ä¸ã10%ã®èåã®ã¦ã·è¡æ¸ï¼FBSï¼ãè£åãã¦ç¶ä»£å¹é¤ããã17Î²ã¨ã¹ãã©ã¸ãªã¼ã«ï¼ä»¥ä¸ãE2ã¨ããï¼ã¾ãã¯ãã¡ããã¿ã±æ½åºç©ã«ããç´°èã®å¦çã®ããã«ãå¹å°ã10%ã®ãã­ã¹ãã©ã³ã³ã¼ããã£ã¼ã³ã¼ã«å¦çãããFBSï¼DCC-FBSï¼ã¨ãã§ãã¼ã«ã¬ãããå«ã¾ãªãRPMIÂ 1640å¹å°ã¨äº¤æãããSRBåæè©ä¾¡ã¯ããã¼ã¦ã§ã«ãºãã«ããå ±åï¼2003å¹´ï¼ã«ãããã£ã¦è¡ã£ãã\n\n(ï¼)ãåæçµæ\n\nãå³ï¼ã«ç¤ºãããã«ãæ½åºç©æ¿åº¦ã4Î¼g/mlã§ç´°èå¢æ®é»å®³çã50%ã«ãªãã6Â åã³8Î¼g/mlã§ã¯80%ã«è³ã£ããã¨ããããã¡ããã¿ã±æ½åºç©ã¯ç´°èå¢æ®æå¶ã«å¯¾ãã¦éçä¾å­æ§ãç¤ºããã¨ãæããã«ãªã£ãã\n\nãã®ããã«ããã¡ããã¿ã±èå­ä½ã®æ½åºç©ã¯ãå®æ½ä¾ï¼ã§ç¢ºèªãããèç®¡æå®³ã®æ¹åä½ç¨ãæãããã®ã®ãã¨ã¹ãã­ã²ã³ã®æã¤çç´°èå¢æ®æ´»æ§ã¯æãã¦ããªããã¨ãç¢ºèªããããæ¬å®æ½ä¾ã®çµæã¯ããã¡ããã¿ã±èå­ä½ã®æ½åºç©ãæä¸ãããã¨ã®å®å¨æ§ãç¤ºããã®ã§ããã\n\n<Example 5> Estrogen-like action of the extract of Himematsutake mycelium We considered that the mechanism to improve the vascular damage caused by the extract of Himematsutake mycelium may be due to the estrogen-like action. Proliferation of MCF-7 cells derived from breast cancer The effect of the extract of Himematsutake was investigated. \n (1) Sulforhodamine B (SRB) colorimetric evaluation Human breast cancer-derived MCF-7 cells were obtained from JCRB Cell Bank (National Institute of Pharmaceutical and Food Health, Tokyo) and RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA). And supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the presence of 5% carbon dioxide and subcultured. The medium was replaced with 10% dextran coated charcoal-treated FBS (DCC-FBS) and phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium for treatment of cells with 17Î² estradiol (hereinafter referred to as E2) or Himematsutake extract . The SRB analysis was evaluated according to a report by Powells et al. (2003). \n (2) Analysis results As shown in FIG. 6, the cell growth inhibition rate reached 50% at an extract concentration of 4 Î¼g / ml, and reached 80% at 6 and 8 Î¼g / ml. It became clear that there was a quantitative dependence on inhibition. \n Thus, although the extract of Himematsutake mycelia has the effect of improving the vascular damage confirmed in Example 4, it was confirmed that it does not have the cancer cell proliferating activity of estrogen. The result of the present example shows the safety of administering the extract of the mycelium of Himematsutake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nãï¼å®æ½ä¾ï¼ï¼éºä¼å­çºç¾ã¬ãã«ã§ã®èå¯ï¼\n\nããã¡ããã¿ã±æ½åºç©ãç¨ãã¦ãéºä¼å­çºç¾ã¬ãã«ã§ã¨ã¹ãã­ã²ã³æ§ä½ç¨ãç¤ºããã©ããããDNAãã¤ã¯ã­ã¢ã¬ã¤ãç¨ãã¦èª¿ã¹ãã\n\nï¼ï¼ï¼cDNAãã¤ã¯ã­ã¢ã¬ã¤ã¢ãã»ã¤\n\ncDNAãã¤ã¯ã­ã¢ã¬ã¤ã¯ãã¨ã¹ãã­ã²ã³ã«å¿ç­ãã172ã®éºä¼å­ãå«ãå¨é¨ã§203ã®éºä¼å­ã®cDNAæ­çï¼500bpï½1.5kbï¼ãã¬ã©ã¹åºæ¿ä¸ã«æ©æ¢°çã«ã¹ããããããã®ã§ãããã¤ã³ãã©ã¸ã¼ã³ãºç¤¾ï¼ç­æ³¢ï¼ã«ãã£ã¦è£½é ããããã®ï¼åååEstrArrayï¼ãç¨ãããEstrArrayåæè©ä¾¡ã®ããã«ãMCF-7ç´°èãã10%ã®DCC-FBSãå«ã¿ããã§ãã¼ã«ã¬ãããå«ã¾ãªãRPMIÂ 1640å¹å°ã§3æ¥éå¹é¤ãã10nMã®E2ã2Î¼g/mlã®ãã¡ããã¿ã±æ½åºç©ãã¾ãã¯æº¶åªã®ã¿ï¼DMSOã¾ãã¯ç¡èã®ããªï¼±æ°´ãã³ã³ãã­ã¼ã«ã¨ãããã®ï¼ã§72æéå¦çãããå¨RNAã¯ISOGENï¼ååç´è¬ç¤¾ï¼æ±äº¬ï¼ãç¨ãã¦ãè£½åã®æç¤ºæ¸ã«å¾ã£ã¦åé¢ãããã¢ã³ãã»ã³ã¹RNAï¼aRNAï¼ã¯ãRiboAmpÂ RNAÂ Amplificationã­ããï¼ã¿ã«ã©ãã¤ãªï¼æ¥æ¬ï¼ãä½¿ç¨ãã¦ã5Â mgã®å¨RNAããç²¾è£½ãããEstrArrayåæè©ä¾¡ã¯ãå¥ãã®å¹é¤ç´°èãç¨ãã3åã®ç¬ç«ããå®é¨çµæããã¨ã«è¡ã£ãã\n\n<Example 6> \nConsideration\n 1 at gene expression level \n It was investigated by using a DNA microarray whether or not an estrogen-like action was exhibited at the gene expression level using a himematsutake extract. \n (1) cDNA microarray assay \n The cDNA microarray is a mechanically spotted cDNA fragment (500 bp to 1.5 kb) of 203 genes including 172 genes that respond to estrogen on a glass substrate, manufactured by InfoJeans (Tsukuba).

In fact, bisphenol A, which is known as a representative example of a chemical substance having an estrogenic action, is a GPR30 receptor or an estrogen-related receptor. Examples of action via Î³ (ERRÎ³) have been reported (Filardo et al., Mol. Endocrinol. magazine, 16, 70-84, 2002; Okada et al., Envirn. Health Perspect., 116, 32-38 pages, 2008). In addition, the fact that chemical substances with estrogen-like action exhibit different signal transduction pathways than estrogen is a basis for improving the shortcomings of estrogen, such as the risk of carcinogenesis / thrombosis risk of estrogen and low specificity to tissues.

Japanese apricot extract increased the expression of two genes involved in the reduction of reactive oxygen species, glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3) and Î±-synuclein (SNCA). Estrogens have been shown to increase the expression of GPX3 and SNCA genes separately from the estrogen receptor pathway, indicating that the antioxidant effect induced by the extract of Japanese matsutake reduces serum oxidized LDL levels (Figure 1). It is thought that it shows that it contributes. In addition, himematsutake extract increases the expression of nitric oxide synthase gene (eNOS). Oxidized LDL induces a decrease in eNOS gene expression, but the addition of himematsutake extract increased the eNOS gene expression (FIG. 11). In cells treated with the extract of himematsutake, the expression of MCP-1 (monocyte-chemotactic protein-1) gene is decreased, and the gene expression of MCP-1 in response to oxidized LDL is inhibited. Therefore, these results can well explain the results of the eNOS gene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nãããã«ããã¡ããã¿ã±æ½åºç©ã®GPX3ãeNOSéºä¼å­ã«å¯¾ããå½±é¿ã¯ã¿ã³ãã¯è³ªã¬ãã«ã§ãç¢ºèªããããã«HUVECç´°èã«ãããGPX3ãåã³eNOSã¿ã³ãã¯è³ªã®ã¦ã¨ã¹ã¿ã³ãã­ããã£ã³ã°è§£æãè¡ã£ãï¼å³ï¼ï¼ï¼ã\n\n\nFurthermore, Western blotting analysis of GPX3 and eNOS protein in HUVEC cells was performed in order to confirm the influence of the extract of Himematsutake on GPX3 and eNOS genes at the protein level (FIG. 12).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nãçµæãå³ï¼ï¼ã«ç¤ºããå³ï¼ï¼ã«ç¤ºãããã«ããã¡ããã¿ã±æ½åºç©ã¯ãeNOSãGPX3éºä¼å­ã®çºç¾ãä¸æããããã¨ãåããã\n\n\nThe results are shown in FIG.

Estrogen activity was evaluated using plasmid pG-ERÎ±-AB for reporter gene testing. Test methods and plasmids were according to the literature (Inoue et al., 2002: J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods 47, 129-135.). Briefly described below. 2.0 mg of reporter gene DNA per 10 \n5\n cells was transfected into MCF-7 cells using Lipofectin (Gibco-BRL). After incubation for 24 hours, add 1 mM ICI 182,780 (ICI) to E \n2\n (10 nM), himematsutake mycelium extract (ABE: 0.01-8 Î¼g / ml), or each concentration of himematsutake mycelium extract After adding the sample, the cells were further cultured for 24 hours. Luciferase activity was measured using a kit, and the value of the control experiment was expressed as 100%. Each test was performed 4 times and the standard deviation (SD) was calculated. ** indicates that the risk factor (p value) is less than 0.01. \n (2) Results The results are shown in FIG. A significant estrogen responsive element-dependent luciferase activity was observed in the mycelium extract. This indicates that the extract of mycelium is an estrogenic activity.

The agaricus (Himematsutake) mycelium preparation (FIG. 20A) used in this Example was compared with three agaricus fruit body preparations (FIGS. 20B, C, and D). None of the fruit body preparations showed a significant peak in the HPLC retention time at which brefeldin A was eluted, but a significant peak was found in the mycelium specimen used in this example. It became clear that the quantitative ratio was at least 150 times in terms of the integral value. This indicates that Brefeldin A hardly exists in the fruit body, and even if the fruit body is used for treatment, the effect derived from Brefeldin A is hardly expected. From this fact, it was found that the effect seen in the mycelium of the matsutake mushroom was peculiar to the mycelium of the matsutake mushroom and was different from the effect in the fruiting body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nãï¼æ¯è¼ä¾ï¼ï¼æ§ããªæº¶åªã«ãããã¬ãã§ã«ãã£ã³ï¼¡ã®æ½åºå¹ç\n\nï¼ï¼ï¼Â è§£ææ¹æ³\n\nããã¡ããã¿ã±å¹é¤èç³¸ä½ä¹¾ç¥ç©2.5Â gãããï¼¡ï¼æ°´æ½åºãï¼¢ï¼ã¨ã¿ãã¼ã«æ½åºãï¼£ï¼ã¡ã¿ãã¼ã«æ½åºãï¼¤ï¼é¢é¸ã¨ãã«æ½åºãè¡ããMILEXç¤¾ã®0.45Â Î¼mãã£ã«ã¿ã¼ã§ãéå¾ãä¸é¨ä¹¾ç¥ãã¦ééãæ¸¬å®ãããããã«ãæ¿åº¦ã5.0Â mg/mlã«èª¿æ´ãã¦Â ãHPLCåæï¼ååç´è¬ç¤¾ã»éç¸ã«ã©ã 5C18-200ãç¨ãã¦ã¡ã¿ãã¼ã«ã§æº¶åºã210nmå¸åæ³¢é·ã§æ¤åºï¼ãè¡ãããã¬ãã§ã«ãã£ã³ï¼¡æº¶åºãã¿ã¼ã³ãæ¯è¼ããï¼å³ã«ãã¼ã¯ä½ç½®ãç¤ºããï¼ã\n\n<Comparative Example 2> Extraction efficiency of Brefeldin A with various solvents (1) Analysis method A: water extraction, B: ethanol extraction, C: methanol extraction, D: ethyl acetate from 2.5 g of dried mycelia cultivated mycelium Extraction was performed, and after filtration through a MILEX 0.45 Î¼m filter, a portion was dried and the weight was measured.

    "text": "Composition and kit for diagnosing immunoglobulin a nephropathy and tgbm nephropathy AbstractThe present invention relates to the development of a protein used as a biomarker for diagnosing IgA nephropathy and TGBM (thin-glomerular-basement-membrane) using urine through a target proteomics method. The present invention relates to a diagnosis biomarker protein and a kit for diagnosing IgA nephropathy and TGBM and predicting progress of the nephropathy in advance using the protein. The protein level is increased or decreased in urine from a patient with IgA nephropathy or TGBM nephropathy compared to urine from a normal patient. According to the present invention, the degree of the disease can be grasped by detecting IgA nephropathy and TGBM, enabling early diagnosis and confirming progress from the patient's urine. In addition, a monoclonal antibody produced based on the diagnosis biomarker protein can be used for an immunoassay kit (ELISA, antibody coated tube test, lateral-flow test, potable biosensor). As well, the monoclonal antibody is used in early diagnosis and progress detection of IgA nephropathy and development of a novel drug for the purpose of treatment.

I don't know the cause, but when bacteria invade our body, we need an immune substance called \"antibody\" to fight it, and one of those antibodies, called immunoglobulin A (IgA), doesn't fight bacteria and the kidney's glomeruli Glomerular destruction of glomeruli is called IgA nephropathy, and biomarkers that measure the progress of IgA nephropathy are proteinuria and creatine, but proteinuria is an indicator of the development of hypertension and cardiovascular disease other than IgA nephropathy. It is difficult to determine the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its high association with other disease markers, etc. TGBM nephropathy also has symptoms such as hematuria and proteinuria, similar to those of IgA nephropathy, but TGBM is relatively prognostic. Is not a bad disease. Standing looked this disease can be diagnosed with IgA nephropathy alone should) that the symptoms and whether the elapsed time and so on, history is a situation that can not be diagnosed have a kidney biopsy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \në°ë¼ì, ììì ì¼ë¡ í¹ì´ì±ê³¼ ë¯¼ê°ëê° ëì ì ê·ì§ë¨ ë§ì»¤ì ìì¸ë¬ ì´ë¥¼ ê²ì¶í  ì ìë ë¨ì¼í´ë¡ í­ì²´ë¥¼ ê°ë°í  ê²½ì°, ë¹ë¨ë³ì± ì ì¦ì ì¡°ê¸°ì§ë¨ ë° ì§íì ëë¥¼ ë¯¸ë¦¬ ìì¸¡ í  ì ìë ííì í¤í¸ ê°ë°ì ëëª¨í  ì ìë¤. ì´ì ë³¸ ë°ëªìë¤ì ìê¸° ì¢ëê¸°ì ë¤ì ë¬¸ì ì ë¤ì ê·¹ë³µíê¸° ìíì¬ ìì ì°êµ¬ ë¸ë ¥í ê²°ê³¼, íê² íë¡íì¤ë¯¹ì¤(proteomics) ê¸°ë²ì ì´ì©íì¬ IgA ì ì¦ ë° TGBM ì ì¦ ì§íì ë°ì´ì¤ë§ì»¤ë¤ì íì¸íê³ , ë³¸ ë°ëªì ìì±íê² ëìë¤.\nTherefore, when developing a new diagnostic marker with high specificity and sensitivity as well as a monoclonal antibody capable of detecting it, it is possible to develop a kit that can predict the early diagnosis and progression of diabetic nephropathy. have.

Its clinical manifestations vary in the appearance of intermittent gross hematuria with upper respiratory tract infections, persistent microscopic hematuria and proteinuria, and in some cases in the form of nephrotic syndrome or acute nephritis, hypertension, progression without knowing, chronic Often found in kidney failure. IgA nephropathy has been reported to progress slowly, with more than 30% of patients developing end-stage renal disease within 20 years. Risk factors affecting prognosis include persistent proteinuria, decreased renal function, persistent hypertension, old age, and male and histological findings. IgA nephropathy is a type of immunocomplex-mediated glomerulopathy, which is caused by the overproduction of polymeric IgA1 in the bone marrow and the structural defect of IgA1 at the same time. It is deposited on the erase and causes damage by the mediators. Microscopic findings of IgA nephropathy are characterized by local or diffuse cell proliferation in mesangium and expansion of extracellular matrix. Cell proliferation is diverse, severe meniscus formation, vascular lesions and trigeminal interstitial lesions are also observed. IgA is markedly deposited on mesangium by immunofluorescence, which is essential for the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy. Often deposited with C3, IgG, IgM and the like. Electron microscopic findings are characterized by the presence of large electron dense deposits on or around mesangium and localized subcutaneous deposition around mesangium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nì´ë¬í IgA ì ì¦ì ì§ë¨ë°©ë²ì ëí ì°êµ¬ë¡ë IgA ì ì¥ë³ì¦ íì ë°±íêµ¬ìì ëí¼ë°ìãëì¤íë ì´ë²ì ì¬ì©í ì ê·í ì ì ìì ì·¨ëë°©ë² ë° ë°±íêµ¬ ì ë ì¬ë¦¬ê³ ë´í´ë ì¤í°ëë¥¼ í¬í¨íë IgA ì ì¦ ì§ë¨ì½ ë° ì¹ë£ì½ì ê´í ê²(íêµ­ê³µê°í¹í í¹1999-82292í¸), ë¹ë¨ë§ë§ì ì§ë¨ í  ì ìë IgA ë¨ë°±ì§ ë° IgA ë¨ë°±ì§ í­ì²´ë¥¼ í¬í¨íë ì§ë¨í¤í¸ ë° ì§ë¨ë°©ë²(íêµ­ë±ë¡í¹í ì 528664í¸), ì ì½ê°ë° ë° ì§ë¨ ë§ì»¤ë¥¼ ëì íê¸° ìí ìê°ë©´ì­ì§í ë±ì í¬í¨íë ì§íê´ë ¨ íì  ë¨ë°±ì§ì ëì íëë° ìì´ì ì ì ì ë°í íë¡íì¼ì ë¨ë°±ì§ ë°í íë¡íì¼ê³¼ ì°ê´ìí¤ë ë°©ë²ì ê´í ê²(íêµ­ê³µê°í¹í ì 2004-54609í¸), í¼ê²ì²´ì íì¡ê³¼ ë¨ë¡ë¶í° ìë¦¬ì  ê²ì²´ë¥¼ ì±ì·¨í ë¤ì ê·¸ ê²ì²´ë¥¼ ì§ëë¶ìê¸°ë¡ ë¶ìíì¬ ì»ì ë¶ê´íì  í¼í¬ë¡ë¶í° ì»ê² ëë ë¨ë°±ì§ íë¡íì¼ ë¶ì ì ë³´ë¥¼ ì¬ì©íì¬ ì§íì ì§íì ëë¥¼ ì§ë¨íë ì¼ë°ì ì¸ ë°©ë²ì ê´í ê²(ë¯¸êµ­í¹íê³µë³´ ì 2007/87448í¸)ê³¼ í¨ê» ì¬ëì íì¡ì¼ë¡ë¶í° ë¹ë¨ë³ì± ì ì¦ íìì ë°ë³ì¬ë¶ ë° ë¹ë¨ë³ìì ë¹ë¨ë³ì± ì ì¦ì ì¡°ê¸°ì§ë¨ ë° ì§íì ëë¥¼ íì¸íì¬ ì¦ìì ì ëë¥¼ íìíë ê²ì¼ë¡ì íì¸ë ë¨ë°±ì§ì ê¸°ì´ë¡ ì ì¡°ë ë¨ì¼í´ë¡ í­ì²´ë immunoassay í¤í¸ì ì´ì©ëë©° ìì¸ë¬ ë¹ë¨ë³ì± ì ì¦ì ìì´ìë ë¹ë¨ë³ìì ë¹ë¨ë³ì± ì ì¦ì ì¡°ê¸°ì§ë¨ ë° ì§íì ëë¥¼ íë¨íë ë°©ë²ì ê´í ê²(íêµ­ë±ë¡í¹í ì 792630í¸) ë±ì´ ìë ¤ì ¸ ìë¤.  \nStudies on the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy include a method of obtaining a novel gene using differential display method in leukocytes of IgA nephropathy, and an IgA nephropathy diagnostic agent and therapeutic agent containing leukocyte-derived oligonucleotides (Korean Patent Publication) Japanese Patent No. 1999-82292), a diagnostic kit and diagnostic method including IgA protein and IgA protein antibody for diagnosing diabetic retina (Korean Patent No. 528664), autoimmune disease for identifying new drug and diagnostic marker, etc. A method for associating a gene expression profile with a protein expression profile in identifying a disease-related target protein comprising a protein (Korean Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2004-54609), comprising: taking a physiological sample from blood and urine of a subject, and then Using protein profile analysis information obtained from spectroscopic peaks obtained by analyzing a sample with a mass spectrometer Together with the general method of diagnosing the progression of the disease (US Patent Publication No. 2007/87448), the presence of diabetic nephropathy from human blood and the early diagnosis and progression of diabetic nephropathy in diabetes The monoclonal antibody prepared on the basis of the protein identified as a measure of the degree of symptoms is used in the immunoassay kit and, in diabetic nephropathy, a method for determining the early diagnosis and progression of diabetic nephropathy in diabetes mellitus ( Korean Patent No. 792630) is known.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \níí¸, IgA ì ì¦ì´ë TGBM ì ì¦ íììì ì¬ê°í ì ì¥ê¸°ë¥ì ì íê° ë°ìëê¸° ì´ì ì ì¡°ìí ì§ë¨ì íµí ì¹ë£ê° ì¤ìí¨ìë ë¶êµ¬íê³  ì´ì ì§ë¨ì ìí´ ì ì ì±ì¸ìì ëíëë ë¬´ì¦ìì íë¨ë ë¨ë°±ë¨ ë§ì ê°ì§ê³  ì ì¥ìê²ê³¼ ê°ì ì¹¨ìµì  ê²ì¬ì ìíì ê²°ì íê¸°ë íë  ì¼ì´ë©°, ì¤ì¬ ì ì¥ìê² ìíì íë ¤íë¤ í´ë ì¬ë¬ ê°ì§ ì´ì ë¡ ëª¨ë  íììì ì¤ì ë¡ ì´ë¥¼ ìííê¸°ë ì´ë ¤ì´ ì¤ì ì´ì´ì ê°í¸íë©´ìë ì íí ìë¡ì´ IgA ì ì¦ì´ë TGBM ì ì¦ì ì§ë¨ë°©ë²ì´ë í¤í¸ì ê°ë°ì´ ìêµ¬ëì´ ìë¤.\nOn the other hand, invasive tests such as kidney biopsy with only asymptomatic hematuria or proteinuria present in young adults for the diagnosis, despite the importance of prompt diagnosis prior to serious renal impairment in patients with IgA nephropathy or TGBM nephropathy.

The small gel is cut into 1 mm \n3\n size using a surgical knife, and then washed for 20 minutes alternately between 25 mM ABC (pH 8.0) buffer and 25 mM ABC (pH 8.0) / 50% ACN buffer. The gel is then dried using reduced pressure drying followed by the usual in-gel digest cloth method. Each protein was reduced for 30 minutes at 56 Â° C. by adding 10 mM DTT, and alkylated by room dark reaction by adding 55 mM iodoacetamide (IAA). Again, wash the gel pieces alternately in 25 mM ABC (pH 8.0) buffer and 25 mM ABC (pH 8.0) / 50% ACN buffer for 20 minutes and dried under reduced pressure to dry the gel.

The peptide obtained above is analyzed by dissolving in 0.1% formic acid. Mobile phase A 0.1% formic / water and mobile phase B 0.1% formic acid / ACN were used. Flow into the trap column for 3 minutes at a flow rate of 10 Î¼L / min. Peptides were separated by a flow of 360 minutes at a flow rate of 300 nl / min at a concentration of 3-40% of mobile phase B, washed for 15 minutes to 90% of mobile phase B, and then flowed into \nmobile phase B\n 3% for 20 minutes to re-stabilize the column. The column temperature is maintained at 35 Â° C., and 100 fmol [Glu 1] -Fibrinopeptide B / Î¼L is transferred to the nanolock reference spray of the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 300 nL / min using an auxiliary pump. All samples were subjected to four replicate experiments. Analysis of tryptic peptides was performed using a Q-Tof Premier mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK). The mass spectrometer has a resolution of 10,000 FWHM in v-mode. All analyzes were carried out in cation mode and TOF analysis was performed in the range of 50 m / z. Once every 30 seconds, [Glu1] -Fibrinopeptide B of bivalent charge is used to correct the real-time mass values. Low collision energy mass spectrometry gathers data for 1 second at 4 eV and high impact energy analysis gathers data for 1 second while increasing energy from 15 eV to 40 eV. Data is collected with a time difference of 0.1 seconds between low collision energy analysis and high collision energy analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<ì¤ìì 5> ìëì  ì ëë¶ì(Relative quantificatuon)\nExample 5 Relative quantificatuon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nì¡ì í¬ë¡ë§í ê·¸ëí¼ ì§ëë¶ìê¸°ë¡ ì»ì´ì§ ë°ì´í°ë ProteinLynx GlobalServer v2.3 (Waters Corporation)ìíí¸ì¨ì´ë¥¼ ì´ì©íì¬ ë¶ìíìë¤. í´ë¬ì¤í°ë§ê³¼ ë¸ë§ë¼ì´ì¦ ë ë°ì´í°ë¡ë¶í° ProteinLynx GlobalServer v2.3ì ìê³ ë¦¬ì¦ì ì´ì©íì¬ ë¨ë°±ì§ì ëì í í ëì ë ê²°ê³¼ì ì íí ì§ëê°ê³¼ ì¡ì í¬ë¡ë§í ê·¸ëí¼ì ì§ì°ìê°ì ì´ì©íì¬ í´ë¬ì¤í°ë§ì ì¤ìíìë¤ . ëì ë í¸ë¦½í± í©íì´ëì í¼í¬ ê°ë(intensity)ë¥¼ ì´ì©íì¬ ê° ë¨ë°±ì§ì ìì ê³ì°íê² ëê³  ì´ë¥¼ ì´ì©íì¬ ê° êµ°ë³ë¡ ë¨ë°±ì§ì ë°íì íì¸íë¤.\nData obtained by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was analyzed using ProteinLynx GlobalServer v2.3 (Waters Corporation) software.

ADV is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that exerts an antiviral effect by inhibiting HBV replication. Studies have confirmed that ADV has good efficacy and safety in patients with HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B.

In the early stage of ADV treatment, several mutations may occur or may occur alone, but as the course of treatment increases, rtA181V often occurs with rtN236T. In the in vitro susceptibility test, the sensitivity of the rtN236T variant strain to ADV decreased by 3.9 to 13.8 times compared with the wild strain virus, while the rtA181V variant decreased by 2.5 to 3.0 times.å·³ There are several studies pointing out that the appearance of rtN236T changes the polarity of amino acids in the replication catalytic active region, which causes the folding of HBV polymerase to change, so it is not conducive to its binding to the substrate during the replication phase, resulting in the replication process being affected. Obstruction. The appearance of rtA181V, to some extent, corrected the change in amino acid polarity, so that after the rtN236T mutation, the polymerase fold was closer to the original state, which was beneficial to the replication of the resistant strain. In addition, both in vivo and in vitro data suggest that the rtA181V variant is less sensitive to lamivudine than the rtN236T variant. This is most likely because the rtA181V variant is adjacent to lamivudine's rtLlSOM, so any occurrence of a mutation will have an ortho effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n çªå rtN236Tå rtA181Vå¯¹ HBeAgé´æ§åé³æ§æ£èçå½±åä¸å®å¨ç¸åã ADV èè¯ç°è±¡å¨ä½çæ¯è¡çä¸ HBeAgé³æ§æ£èä¸­çåççç¸å½ä½ï¼èè¯çåçä¹é¨å \n\nä½ç°å¨ ALTçåé«ä¸ã å¯¹äº HBeAgé´æ§çæ£èæ¥è¯´ï¼ ADVæ²»ç 48 å¨ååè¯ï¼ æ²»çè·çå¸¸å¨åè¯ 1 ~ 2å¹´åæ¶å¤±ã ä½è¥ç»§ç»­ç¨è¯ç´è³ 144å¨ï¼ æ£èå¨æ²»ç 48å¨ æ¶æè·å¾ççæ¯å­¦ã è¡æ¸çååç»ç»å­¦ç­åæ¹é¢æ¹åï¼ å°è¢«ä¿çä¸è¿ä¸æ­¥å¥½è½¬ã æé´èè¯åççå¾ä½ï¼ ä¸è´é¢ä½ç¨ä¸åå§ç 48å¨æ²»çæ¶ç¸ä¼¼ã \nThe effects of mutations rtN236T and rtA181V on HBeAg-negative and positive patients were not identical. The incidence of ADV resistance in hypoviral and HBeAg-positive patients is quite low, and the occurrence of drug resistance is also partially  Reflected in the rise of ALT. For HBeAg-negative patients, ADV is discontinued after 48 weeks of treatment, and the benefit of treatment often disappears after 1 to 2 years of discontinuation. However, if the drug is continued until 144 weeks, the virological, serum biochemical and histological improvements obtained by the patient at the 48th week of treatment will be retained and further improved. The incidence of drug resistance was low during the period and the negative effects were similar to those at the initial 48-week treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n ç®åï¼ ADVä¹å¸¸ç¨äºåææç±³å¤«å®æ²»çå¤±æçæ£èã æ©æ 48å¨å 96å¨ä¸´åº è¯éªåæç¤ºï¼ æ è®ºæ¯éçåè¿æ¯ YMDDçªååçæ¯æ ªï¼ åå¯¹ ADVææï¼ æ²»çå HBV DNA ä¸éåææ°è¶å¿ï¼ ä¸æ£èçèåæ§è¯å¥½ã æä¸¤ç§è¯ç©èååºç¨æ´å æ æå°æå¶äºçæ¯çå¤å¶ï¼ ä½ä¹å¯è½åçèåé¶åºç rtL180M+M204V å rtN236T èåçªåï¼ å¯¹æç±³å¤«å®å ADVäº§çåéèè¯ã å°½ç®¡ç ç©¶è¡¨æï¼ æç±³å¤«å®èè¯æ ªå¯¹ ADVææï¼ ä½å¯¹ HBVæ¬èº«æ¥è¯´ï¼ ä¸ç§åå¼èåå¢å äºå¯¹ ADVçèè¯æ°´å¹³ï¼ ä¸ rtN236Tåçªåç¸æ¯ï¼ å¯¹ ADVçæææ§ä¸éäº 2åã å¨åå­æ°´å¹³ï¼ èåçªåå¯¼è´ åºç©ç»åä½ç¹æ´é¾ä¸é¿å¾·ç¦é¦ç»åï¼ å æ­¤è¿ä¸æ­¥éä½äºå¯¹ ADVçæææ§ã \nÂ Currently, ADV is also commonly used in patients with previous lamivudine treatment failure. Early 48-week and 96-week clinical trials suggest that both wild-type and YMDD mutant strains are sensitive to ADV, and HBV DNA declines exponentially after treatment, and patients are well tolerated. Therefore, the combination of the two drugs can more effectively inhibit the replication of the virus, but the rtL180M+M204V and rtN236T combination mutations in the polymerase region may also occur, which is resistant to lamivudine and ADV. Although studies have shown that lamivudine-resistant strains are sensitive to ADV, for HBV itself, the three variants combined increased resistance to ADV, and the sensitivity to ADV was reduced compared to the rtN236T single mutation. Times. At the molecular level, combined mutations make the substrate binding site more difficult to bind to adefovir, thus further reducing sensitivity to ADV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n è¿ä»ä¸ºæ­¢ï¼ å­¦èä»¬åç°ä¸ä½ HBVèåé¶åºå åºç rtA181Vã rtN236Tåå¼å¯ å¼èµ· ADVç¸å³èè¯ï¼å¶ä»è®¸å¤ä¸ ADVç¸å³ççªåï¼ä¾å¦ rtI233Vã rtS85A> rtS85Pã rtS119Aã rtH133Lã rtV214Aã rtH234Qã rtP237Hå rtN238Dç­ï¼ ä¹å¯è½ä¸ ADV èè¯æå³ã ç¶èï¼ ä»æè®¸å¤æ¢æ§ä¹åèçæ£èï¼ å¨ ADVæ²»çä¸­åºç°ä¸´åºèè¯ï¼ å´ æ£æµä¸åºå·²ç¥åå¼ä½ç¹çå­å¨ã æ ADVç¸å³ HBVçªåçç ç©¶è¿éè¦è¿ä¸æ­¥çæ¢ ç´¢ã åæåå®¹ \nÂ So far, scholars have found that not only the rtA181V and rtN236T variants of the HBV polymerase gene region can cause ADV-related resistance, but many other ADV-related mutations, such as rtI233V, rtS85A> rtS85P, rtS119A, rtH133L, rtV214A, rtH234Q, rtP237H, and rtN238D.

According to this principle, hybridization detection can be further carried out by the following two methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 1 )ååçº¿æ§æ¢éæäº¤æ³ï¼ åºäºæ¢éæäº¤åçï¼ åè®¾è®¡åæä¸ç³»åæ¢éï¼ è¦ç çªåé«ååºï¼ å¶ä¸­ Sç³»åæ¢ééå¯¹éçæ ªåºå, Rç³»åæ¢éå«æ°ä¸ªæå¸¸è§çªååº åçæ¢éï¼ è¿å¯ä»¥è®¾è®¡ä¸ä¸ªæç§å±ç¹å¼æ§çæ¢éï¼ å°è¿ä¸ç³»åæ¢éé¡ºæ¬¡åºå®äºå ä¸æäº¤èä¸ï¼ å¨ä¸¥æ ¼æ¡ä»¶ä¸ä¸äº²åç´ æ è®°ç PCRäº§ç©æäº¤ï¼ æ£æµæäº¤ä¿¡å·ï¼ æ ¹æ® ä¸åæäº¤å¸¦è°±å¤å®åºçªåææ åå¤§è´ä½ç½®ã åºäºååæäº¤çåçï¼ æ©å¢åçè¢«ç ç©ç´ æ è®°ç HBV DNAäº§ç©ï¼ ä¸å¹³è¡çº¿å½¢å¼åºå®å¨å°¼é¾èæ£æµæ¡ä¸çç¹å¼æ§å¯¡æ ¸ è·é¸æ¢éæäº¤ã æäº¤åï¼ æªè½æäº¤ç DNAä»æ£æµæ¡ä¸è¢«æ´è±ã éåå å¥æ è®°æç¢± æ§ç£·é¸é¶çé¾éäº²åç´ ï¼ ä¸æäº¤äº§ç©ä¸æ è®°ççç©ç´ ç»åã æåå å¥ BCIP/NBT æ¾è²ï¼ æ¾ç°ç´«è² /æ£è²ï¼ ä»èå¤æ­ç»æã \nÂ 1) Reverse linear probe hybridization method: Based on the principle of probe hybridization, a series of probes are designed to cover the high-risk region of mutation. The S-series probes are directed to the wild-type sequence, and the R-series probes contain several common mutation sequences. The probe can also be designed with a species-specific probe. The probes are sequentially immobilized on the same hybrid membrane, and hybridized with the avidin-labeled PCR product under stringent conditions to detect the hybridization signal. The presence or absence of the mutation and the approximate location were determined based on the different hybridization bands. Based on the principle of reverse hybridization, the amplified biomarker-labeled HBV DNA product is hybridized with a specific oligonucleotide probe immobilized on a nylon membrane strip in parallel. After hybridization, the DNA that failed to hybridize is eluted from the test strip. Streptavidin labeled with a basic phosphatase is then added to bind to the labeled biotin on the hybridization product. Finally, BCIP/NBT color is added, and purple/brown appears to judge the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 2 )åºå è¯çæ³ï¼ å©ç¨æäº¤çåçï¼ å³ DNAæ ¹æ®ç¢±åºéå¯¹ååï¼ å¨å¸¸æ¸©ä¸å ä¸­æ§æ¡ä»¶ä¸å½¢æåé¾ DNAåå­ï¼ ä½å¨é«æ¸©ã ç¢±æ§æææºæº¶åç­æ¡ä»¶ä¸ï¼ åèºæä¹ é´çæ°¢é®æ­è£ï¼ åèºæè§£å¼ï¼ å½¢æåé¾åå­ï¼ç§°ä¸º DNA Â¾æ§ï¼ DNAåæ§æ¶çæ¸© åº¦ç§° Tmå¼ï¼ã åæ§ç DNAé»åº¦ä¸éï¼ æ²ééåº¦å¢å ï¼ æµ®åä¸åï¼ ç´«å¤å¸æ¶å¢å ã å½æ¶é¤åæ§æ¡ä»¶åï¼åæ§ DNAä¸¤æ¡äºè¡¥é¾å¯ä»¥éæ°ç»åï¼æ¢å¤åæ¥çåèºæç»æï¼ è¿ä¸è¿ç¨ç§°ä¸ºå¤æ§ã å¤æ§å DNAï¼ å¶çåæ§è´¨è½å¾å°æ¢å¤ã å©ç¨ DNAè¿ä¸éè¦ çåç¹æ§ï¼ å°ä¸¤ä¸ªä»¥ä¸ä¸åæ¥æºçå¤æ ¸è·é¸é¾ä¹é´ç±äºäºè¡¥æ§èä½¿å®ä»¬å¨å¤æ§è¿ ç¨ä¸­å½¢æå¼æºæååå­çè¿ç¨ç§°ä¸ºæäº¤ ï¼hydridization )ã æäº¤ä½ä¸­çåå­ä¸æ¯æ¥ èªåä¸ä¸ªäºèä½åå­ã ç±äºæ¸©åº¦æ¯å¶ä»åæ§æ¹æ³æ´å®¹ææ§å¶ï¼ å½åé¾çæ ¸é¸å¨é« \n\näºå¶åæ§æ¸©åº¦ ï¼Tinå¼)æ¶ï¼ è§£èºææåé¾åå­ï¼ å½æ¸©åº¦éå°ä½äº Tmå¼æ¶ï¼ åé¾ åå­æ ¹æ®ç¢±åºçéå¯¹ååååº¦å¤æ§æåé¾åå­ã å æ­¤éå¸¸å©ç¨æ¸©åº¦çååä½¿ DNA å¨åæ§åå¤æ§çè¿ç¨ä¸­è¿è¡æ ¸é¸æäº¤ã \n2) Gene chip method: Using the principle of hybridization, that is, DNA forms double-stranded DNA molecules under normal temperature and neutral conditions according to the principle of base pairing, but under conditions of high temperature, basic or organic solvent, The hydrogen bond is broken, and the double helix is unraveled to form a single-stranded molecule (called DNA 3â4, and the temperature at which the DNA is denatured is called Tm). Denatured DNA decreases in viscosity, sedimentation rate increases, buoyancy increases, and UV absorption increases. When the denaturing conditions are removed, the two complementary strands of the denatured DNA can recombine and restore the original double helix structure. This process is called renaturation. After renaturation, the physicochemical properties of DNA can be restored. Using the important physicochemical properties of DNA, the process of forming heterologous hybrid molecules in the renaturation process due to the complementarity between two or more different polynucleotide chains is called hydridization. The molecules in the hybrid are not from the same dimeric molecule. Because the temperature is easier to control than other denaturation methods, when the double-stranded nucleic acid is high  At its denaturation temperature (Tin value), it de-spins into a single-stranded molecule; when the temperature falls below the Tm value, the single-stranded molecule is refolded into a double-stranded molecule according to the base pairing principle. Therefore, the change in temperature is usually used to cause nucleic acid hybridization in the process of denaturation and renaturation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n æ ¸é¸åå­åé¾ä¹é´æäºè¡¥çç¢±åºé¡ºåºï¼ éè¿ç¢±åºå¯¹ä¹é´éå±ä»·é®çå½¢æå³åº ç°ç¨³å®çåé¾åºï¼ è¿æ¯æ ¸é¸åå­æäº¤çåºç¡ã æäº¤åå­çå½¢æå¹¶ä¸è¦æ±ä¸¤æ¡åé¾ çç¢±åºé¡ºåºå®å¨äºè¡¥ï¼ æä»¥ä¸åæ¥æºçæ ¸é¸åé¾å½¼æ­¤ä¹é´åªè¦æä¸å®ç¨åº¦çäºè¡¥ åºåå°±å¯ä»¥å½¢ææäº¤åé¾ï¼ åå­æäº¤å¯å¨ DNAä¸ DNAã RNAä¸ RNAæ R Aä¸ DNAçä¸¤æ¡åé¾ä¹é´ã å©ç¨åå­æäº¤è¿ä¸ç¹æ§ï¼ åå°æäº¤é¾ä¸­çä¸æ¡ç¨æç§å¯ä»¥ æ£æµçæ¹å¼è¿è¡æ è®°ï¼ åä¸å¦ä¸ç§æ ¸é¸ (å¾æµæ ·æ¬)è¿è¡åå­æäº¤ï¼ ç¶åå¯¹å¾æµæ ¸é¸ åºåè¿è¡å®æ§æå®éæ£æµï¼ åæå¾æµæ ·æ¬ä¸­æ¯å¦å­å¨è¯¥åºå æè¯¥åºå çè¡¨è¾¾ææ  ååã åºå è¯çéå¸¸éç¨ååæäº¤æ¹æ³, å³å°å¤ä¸ªæ¢éåå­ç¹å¨è¯çä¸ï¼ æ ·æ¬ç æ ¸é¸é¶æ è¿è¡æ è®°åä¸è¯çè¿è¡æäº¤ã è¿æ ·çä¼ç¹æ¯åæ¶å¯ä»¥ç ç©¶æåä¸ä¸çé¶ æ çè³å¨åºå ç»ä½ä¸ºé¶åºåã \nÂ There is a complementary base sequence between the single strands of the nucleic acid molecule, and a stable double-stranded region is formed by the formation of a non-covalent bond between the base pairs, which is the basis for hybridization of the nucleic acid molecule. The formation of hybrid molecules does not require that the base sequences of the two single strands be completely complementary. Therefore, nucleic acid single strands of different origins can form hybrid double strands with a certain degree of complementary sequence, and hybridization can be carried out in DNA and DNA. RNA and RNA or between RA and the two single strands of DNA. By utilizing the property of molecular hybridization, one of the hybridization chains is first labeled in a detectable manner, and then hybridized with another nucleic acid (sample to be tested), and then the nucleic acid sequence to be tested is qualitatively or quantitatively detected. The presence or absence of the gene or the expression of the gene in the sample to be tested is analyzed. Gene chips usually use a reverse hybridization method in which a plurality of probe molecules are spotted on a chip, and the nucleic acid target of the sample is labeled and hybridized with the chip. This has the advantage that thousands of targets or even whole genomes can be studied simultaneously as target sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n 2ã èåé¶é¾å¼ååºä¸éå¶æ§çæ®µé¿åº¦å¤ææ§ ï¼PCRâ RFLP ) åæææ¯ï¼ å çä¸ºéç¨ PCRæ©å¢ç®ç DNAçæ®µï¼ç¶åå°å¾æ£æµç DNAçæ®µç¨éå¶æ§ååé¶é¶ åï¼ éå¶æ§ååé¶è¯å«å¹¶åå²ç¹å¼çåºåï¼ ç¶åå°é¶ååçäº§ç©è¿è¡çµæ³³ï¼ åç± éå¶é¶å¾è°±åææ­¤æ®µåºåçç¹å¼é¶åä½ç¹ï¼ åç±çæ®µçå¤æ ·æ§æ¥æ¯å¯¹ä¸åæ¥æºåº å åºåçå·®å¼æ§ã è¿é rtE218Gçªåæ ¸è·é¸åå«äºæè¿°éå¶æ§ååé¶çè¯å«åºå ä¸­ã å¨æ¬åæçä¸ä¸ªå®æ½ä¾ä¸­ï¼ ä» GenBankä¸­éå HBVååºå ååèæ ªåºåï¼ è®¾è®¡è¯±åå¼ç© B2 (ä¸æ¸¸ 5'-TTG GTAATA GAG GTA AAA AGG TAC-3' ), è¯¥å¼ç© ä¸ rtE218Gçåå¼ä½ç¹å±åææå¯è¢« ^Â«Â« 1ååé¶è¯å«çé¶åä½ç¹ã åºç¨ B1 (ä¸ æ¸¸ 5ï¼- GAG TGG GCC TCA GTC CGT TTC TC-3ï¼ï¼ï¼ ä¸ B2 , æ©å¢ HBV DNA, å¾å° 160bpæ©å¢çæ®µï¼ åç¨ Î± Îéå¶æ§ååé¶æ¶åï¼ rtE218Gåå¼æ ªè¢«åæ 140bpå 20bpä¸¤ä¸ªçæ®µï¼ èéçæ ªä¸è½è¢« åå¼ï¼ ä¿æ 160bpççæ®µã \nÂ 2. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis technique: The principle is to use PCR to amplify the DNA fragment of interest, and then the DNA fragment to be detected is digested with restriction endonuclease to limit The endonuclease recognizes and cleaves the specific sequence, and then electrophoreses the digested product, and then analyzes the specific restriction site of the sequence by restriction enzyme mapping, and compares the different source gene sequences by the diversity of the fragments.

The basic principle of LCR is to rapidly perform DNA fragment amplification by ligating two adjacent oligonucleotide strands complementary to the template DNA under the action of DNA ligase. DNA ligase ligates two adjacent oligonucleotide fragments complementary to the template; DNA strand. The presence of a base mismatch at the linker of the two oligonucleotides prevents the ligation reaction from occurring. So through LCR, you can clearly distinguish between oligomerization  Whether the nucleotide is fully complementary to the template DNA, detects a point mutation in the gene. The program is: template DNA, DNA ligase, oligonucleotide primer under the corresponding reaction conditions, first heated to a certain temperature (94 95 Î) to denature DNA, double-stranded, and then cooled annealing (about 65 )), primer The complementary template DNA binds and leaves a gap. If the adjacent oligonucleotide primer hybridizing with the target sequence is completely complementary to the target sequence, the DNA ligase can be ligated to close the gap, then the three steps of the LCR reaction (Degeneration-anneal-linkage) can be repeated, and the product of each ligation reaction can be used as a template in the next round of reactions, allowing more oligonucleotides to be ligated and amplified. If the target sequence at the junction is a little mutated, the primer cannot bind precisely to the target sequence, and the spatial structure of the nucleotide near the gap changes, the ligation reaction cannot proceed, and the ligation product cannot be formed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n LCRçå¼ç©æ¯ä¸¤å¯¹åå«äºè¡¥çå¼ç©ï¼ å¼ç©é¿åº¦ä¸º 20 ~ 26ä¸ªï¼ ä»¥ä¿è¯å¼ç©ä¸é¶ åºåçç¹å¼æ§ç»åï¼ LCRè¯å«ç¹çªåçç¹å¼æ§é«äº PCR, å¶ç¹å¼æ§é¦ååå³äºå¼ ç©ä¸æ¨¡æ¿çç¹å¼æ§ç»åï¼ å¶æ¬¡æ¯èç­è¿æ¥é¶çç¹å¼æ§ã LCRè¿æ¥ååºæ¸©åº¦æ¥è¿å¯¡ è·é¸çè§£é¾æ¸©åº¦ (Tm), å èè¯å«åæ ¸è·é¸ééçç¹å¼æ§æé«. \nÂ LCR primers are two pairs of complementary primers, the primer length is 20 ~ 26, to ensure the specific binding of the primer to the target sequence, LCR recognition point mutation specificity is higher than PCR, its specificity depends first on the primer and template The specific binding, followed by the specificity of the thermostable ligase.

When electrophoresed in a neutral polyacrylamide gel without a denaturant, the mobility of the DNA single strand is related to the length of the DNA strand, and more importantly depends on the conformation formed by the DNA single strand. Under non-denaturing conditions, DNA single strands can fold themselves to form a conformation with a certain spatial structure. This conformation is determined by the single-stranded base of DNA, and its stability is maintained by the interaction of local sequences within the molecule (mainly hydrogen bonds). The single strands of DNA of the same length are in different order, and even a single base is different, the conformation is different, and the electrophoretic mobility is different. After the PCR product is denatured, the single-stranded product undergoes neutral polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and when the target DNA contains a base substitution, or a few base insertions or deletions, the mobility shift occurs due to a change in mobility. The variant DNA can be distinguished from normal DNA. Thus, the PCR-SSCP analysis technique is a DNA single-strand gel electrophoresis technique that detects genetic variation based on changes in electrophoretic mobility of a single-stranded DNA single strand of different conformations in a neutral polyacrylamide gel. This technology is widely used in the detection of oncogenes and anti-cancer gene mutations, pathogenic gene analysis of genetic diseases, and gene diagnosis, gene mapping and the like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n ä¸ºäºé«çµæç¹å¼æ§å°æ¾ç¤º SSCPåæç»æï¼ ç°å·²åå±å¤ç§ PCR-SSCPææ¯ï¼ åæå¶ä¼å¿åéç¨é¢åã ä¾å¦ï¼ å¯ä»¥å¨ PCRæ©å¢ä¸­ç¨åä½ç´ æè§åç´ ç­æ è®°å¼ç© ææ ¸è·ï¼ ä¹å¯ä»¥å¨çµæ³³åç¨é¶æææº´åä¹é­æè²ä»¥æ¾ç¤ºç»æã è¿éå°éç¹ä»ç»æ å¸¸ç¨çæ¾å°æ§åä½ç´  PCR- SSCPæ³ã å¨è¿è¡ PCRæ©å¢ç¹å®é¶åºå åºåæ¶ï¼ å©ç¨ Î³ -32P-ATPæ è®°å¼ç©æç´æ¥å¨ PCRååºä½ç³»ä¸­å å¥ a -32P-dCTPè¿è¡ PCRæ©å¢ï¼ ä½¿æ©å¢äº§ç©å¸¦æåä½ç´ æ è®°ç©ï¼ ç¶åå°æ©å¢äº§ç©åæ§ä¸ºåé¾è¿è¡éåæ§èä¸ç¯é° èºåè¶çµæ³³ï¼ æ¾å°èªæ¾å½±æ¾ç¤ºç»æã å©ç¨å¼ç©æ è®°æç¢±åºæºå¥æ³ä½¿ PCRæ©å¢äº§ç© å¸¦æåä½ç´ æ è®°ç©ï¼ åå¯ä½¿äº§ç©ä¿¡å·å¢å¼ºå ä¸ªæ°éçº§ã äºèç¸æ¯è¾ï¼ åèç»æµã æ©å¢ç¹å¼æ§å¼ºï¼ å¤ç¨äºå¤§æ ·æ¬çæ£æµåç­éï¼ åèæä½ç®ä¾¿ï¼ éäºä¸è¬å®éªå®¤å¼ å±ï¼ å¯ç¨äºå°æ ·æ¬æå¤§æ ·æ¬çæ£æµåç­æ¥ã \nÂ In order to display SSCP analysis results with high sensitivity and specificity, a variety of PCR-SSCP techniques have been developed, each with its advantages and applicable fields. For example, primers or nucleosides may be labeled with an isotope or fluorescein in PCR amplification, or may be stained with silver stain or ethidium bromide after electrophoresis to display the results. The most common radioisotope PCR-SSCP method will be highlighted here. When PCR-amplification of a specific target gene sequence, PCR amplification is carried out by using Î³-32P-ATP-labeled primer or directly adding a-32P-dCTP to the PCR reaction system, so that the amplified product carries an isotope label and then expands. The product was denatured into a single strand for non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the results were shown by autoradiography. The use of primer labeling or base incorporation to allow PCR amplification products to carry isotope labels can increase product signal orders of magnitude. Compared with the two, the former has strong economic and amplification specificity, and is mostly used for detection and screening of large samples. The latter is easy to operate and suitable for general laboratory development, and can be used for detection and screening of small samples or large samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n æ¬åæè¿ä¸æ­¥æä¾æ£æµ rtE218Gçªåä½ç¹åé´å®ç¸åº HBVçªåçæ¯æ ªçæ£æµ \n\nè¯åï¼ å¶ä¸­åæ¬åç§å¼ç©å /ææ¢éã è¿å¯ä»¥è¿ä¸æ­¥å°æè¿°æ£æµè¯ååå¿è¦çå¶å® è¯åç»è£ææ£æµè¯åçä»¥æ¹ä¾¿ä½¿ç¨ã ä¾å¦ï¼ å°ä¸è¿°å¼ç©ä¸éå¶æ§ååé¶ç­ç»æ\nThe invention further provides for detecting the rtE218G mutation site and identifying the corresponding HBV mutant virus strain.

For a recent review, see Nobel et al., Eur. J. Bio- chem. 2001 , 268: 4113-4125.\n\n\nThere exist numerous classes of HSDs. The 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11-Î²-HSDs) catalyze the interconversion of active glucocorticoids (such as Cortisol and corticosterone), and their inert forms (such as cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone). The isoform 11-beta- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11-Î²-HSD-1) is widely expressed in liver, adipose tissue, brain, lung and other glucocorticoid tissue, while the isoform 2 (11-Î²-HSD-2) expression is limited to tissues that express the min- eralocorticoid receptor, such as kidney, gut and placenta. Then the inhibition of 11Î²-HSD-2 is associated with serious side effects, such as hypertension.\n\n\nExcess Cortisol is associated with numerous disorders, including diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hypertension. The administration \n\n of 11 Î²-HSD-1 inhibitors decreases the level of Cortisol and other 11 Î²- hydroxysteroids in target tissues, thereby reducing the effects of excessive amounts of Cortisol and other 11Î²-hydroxysteroids. Thus, 11-Î²-HSD-1 is a potential target for therapy associated with numerous disorders that may be ameliorated by reduction of glucocorticoid action. Therefore, the inhibition of\n\n\n11-Î²-HSD-1 can be used to prevent, treat or control diseases mediated by abnormally high levels of Cortisol and other 11Î²-hydroxysteroids, such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension or dyslipidemia. Inhibition of 11-Î²-HSD-1 activity in the brain such as to lower Cortisol levels may also be useful to treat or 0 reduce anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment or age-related cognitive dysfunction (Seckl, et al., Endocrinology, 2001 , 142: 1371-1376).\n\n\nCortisol is an important and well recognized anti-inflammatory hormone, which also acts as an antagonist to the action of insulin in the liver, such that insulin sensitivity is reduced, resulting in increased gluconeogenesis and ele-\n\n\nI O vated levels of glucose in the liver. Patients who already have impaired glucose tolerance have a greater probability of developing type 2 diabetes in the presence of abnormally high levels of Cortisol (Long et al., J. Exp. Med. 1936, 63: 465-490; Houssay, Endocrinology 1942, 30: 884-892). In addition, it has been well substantiated that 11-Î²-HSD-1 plays an important role in the regulation of local glucocorticoid effect and of glucose production in the liver (Jamieson et al., J. Endocrinol. 2000, 165: 685-692). In Walker, et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995, 80: 3155-3159, it was reported that the administration of the non-specific 11Î²-HSD-1 inhibitor carbenoxolone resulted in im- 5 proved hepatic insulin sensitivity in humans.\n\n\nFurthermore, the hypothesized mechanism of action of 11-Î²-HSD-1 in the treatment of diabetes has been supported by various experiments conducted in mice and rats. These studies showed that the mRNA levels and activities of two key enzymes in hepatic glucose production, phosphoenolpyruvate 0 carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) were reduced upon administration of 11-Î²-HSD-1 inhibitors. In addition, blood glucose levels and hepatic glucose production were shown to be reduced in 11-Î²-HSD-1 \n\n knockout mice. Additional data gathered using this murine knockout model also confirm that inhibition of 11-Î²-HSD-1 will not cause hypoglycemia, since the basal levels of PEPCK and G6Pase are regulated independently of glucocorticoids (Kotelevtsev et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1997, 94: 14924- 14929).\n\n\nTherefore, the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of an 11-Î²-HSD-1 inhibitor is effective in treating, controlling and ameliorating the symptoms of diabetes, especially non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM, type 2 diabetes mellitus) and administration of a therapeutically effective amount of an 11-Î²-HSD-1 inhibitor on a regular basis delays or prevents the onset of diabetes, particularly in humans.\n\n\nThe effect of elevated levels of Cortisol is also observed in patients who have Cushing's Syndrome, which is a metabolic disease characterized by high levels of Cortisol in the blood stream. Patients with Cushing's Syndrome often develop NIDDM.\n\n\nExcessive levels of Cortisol have been associated with obesity, perhaps due to increased hepatic gluconeogenesis. Abdominal obesity is closely associated with glucose intolerance, diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyc- eridemia and other factors of Metabolic Syndrome, such as high blood pressure, elevated VLDL and reduced HDL (Montague et al., Diabetes, 2000, 49: 883-888). In obese subjects, 11-Î²-HSD-1 activity in adipose tissue is markedly increased and positively correlated with body mass. It has also been reported that inhibition of the 11-Î²-HSD-1 in pre-adipocytes (stromal cells) re- suited in a decreased rate of differentiation into adipocytes. This is predicted to result in diminished expansion (possibly reduction) of the omental fat depot, which may lead to reduced central obesity (Bujalska et al., Lancet 1997, 349: 1210-1213).\n\n\nThus, the administration of an effective amount of an 11-Î²-HSD-1 inhibitor is useful in the treatment or control of obesity. Long-term treatment with an\n\n\n11-Î²-HSD-1 inhibitor is also useful in delaying or preventing the onset of \n\n - A -\n\n\nobesity, especially if the patient uses an 11-Î²-HSD-1 inhibitor in combination with controlled diet end exercise.\n\n\nBy reducing insulin resistance and maintaining serum glucose at normal concentrations, compounds of the present invention also have utility in the treatment and prevention of conditions that accompany type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance, including the Metabolic Syndrome, obesity, reactive hypoglycemia and diabetic dyslipidemia.\n\n\nInhibition of 11-Î²-HSD-1 in mature adipocytes is expected to attenuate secretion of the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), which is an independent cardiovascular risk factor, as reported in Halleux et al., J; Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999, 84: 4097-4105. In addition, a correlation has been shown to exist between glucocorticoid activity and certain cardiovascular risk factors. This suggests that a reduction of the glucocorticoid effects would be beneficial in the treatment or prevention of certain cardiovascular diseases (Walker et al., Hypertension 1998, 31 : 891-895; and Fraser et al., Hypertension 1999, 33: 1364 1368).\n\n\nSince hypertension and dyslipidemia contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and inhibition of 11-Î²-HSD-1 activity and a reduction in the amount of Cortisol are beneficial in treating or controlling hypertension, administration of a therapeutically effective amount of an 11-Î²-HSD-1 inhibitor of the present invention may also be especially beneficial in treating, controlling or delaying the onset of or preventing atherosclerosis.\n\n\n11-Î²-HSD-1 has also been implicated in the process of appetite control and therefore is believed to play an additional role in weight-related disorders. It is known that adrenalectomy attenuates the effect of fasting to increase both food intake and hypothalamic neuropeptide Y expression. This suggests that glucocorticoids play a role in promoting food intake and that inhibition of 11-Î²-HSD-1 in the brain may increase satiety, thus resulting in a decreased food intake (Woods et al., Science 1998, 280: 1378-1383). \n\n Another possible therapeutic effect associated with modulation of 11-Î²- HSD- 1 is that which is related to various pancreatic aliments. It is reported that inhibition of 11 Î²-HSD-1 in murine pancreatic Î²-cells increases glucose stimulated insulin secretion (Davani et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275: 34841- 34844). This follows from the preceding discovery that glucocorticoids were previously found to be responsible for reduced pancreatic insulin release in vivo (Billaudel et al., Horm. Metab. Res. 1979, 11 : 555-560). Thus, it is suggested that inhibition of 11-Î²-HSD-1 would yield other beneficial effects in the treatment of diabetes other than the predicted effects on the liver and of fat reduction.\n\n\nExcessive levels of Cortisol in the brain may also result in neuronal loss or dysfunction through the potentiation of neurotoxins. Administration of an effective amount of an 11-Î²-HSD-1 inhibitor results in the reduction, amelioration, control or prevention of cognitive impairment associated with aging and of neuronal dysfunction. Cognitive impairment has been associated with aging, and excess levels of Cortisol in the brain (see J. R. Seckl and B. R. Walker, Endocrinology, 2001, 142: 1371 1376, and references cited therein). 11Î²-HSD-1 also regulates glucocorticoid activity in the brain and thus contributes to neurotoxicity (Rajan et al., Neuroscience 1996, 16: 65- 70; Seckl et al., Necroendocrinol. 2000, 18: 49-99). Stress and/or glucocorticoids are known to influence cognitive function (de Quervain et al., Nature 1998, 394: 787-790), and unpublished results indicate significant memory improvement in rats treated with a non-specific 11Î²-HSD-1 inhibitor. These reports, in addi- tion to the known effects of glucocorticoids in the brain, suggest that inhibiting 11Î²-HSD-1 in the brain may have a positive therapeutic effect against anxiety, depression and related conditions (Tranche et al., Nature Genetics 1999, 23: 99-103). 11 Î²-HSD-1 reactivates 11-dehydrocorticosterone to corticoster- one in hippocampal cells and can potentiate kinase neurotoxicity, resulting in age-related learning impairments. Therefore, selective inhibitors of 11Î²-HSD- 1 are believed to protect against hippocampal function decline with age (Yau et al., Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2001 , 98: 4716-4721). Thus, it has been hy- \n\n pothesized that inhibition of 11 Î²-HSD-1 in the human brain would protect against deleterious glucocorticoid-mediated effects on neuronal function, such as cognitive impairment, depression, and increased appetite.\n\n\nFurthermore, 11Î²-HSD-1 is believed to play a role in immunomodulation based on the general perception that glucocorticoids suppress the immune system. There is known to be a dynamic interaction between the immune system and the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis (Rook, Baillier's Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000, 13: 576-581), and glucocorticoids help balance between cell-mediated responses and humoral responses.\n\n\n10\n\n\nIncreased glucocorticoid activity, which may be induced by stress, is associated with a humoral response and as such, the inhibition of 11 Î²-HSD-1 may result in shifting the response towards a cell-based reaction. In certain disease states, such as tuberculosis, leprosy and psoriasis, and even under\n\n\n \n15\n conditions of excessive stress, high glucocorticoid activity shifts the immune response to a humoral response, when in fact a cell based response may be more beneficial to the patient. Inhibition of 11Î²-HSD-1 activity and the attendant reduction in glucocorticoid levels on the other hand shifts the immune response toward a cell based response (D. Mason, Immunology Today,\n\n\n20 1991 , 12: 57-60, and G.A.Vt. Rook, Baillier's Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 1999, 13: 576-581). It follows then, that an alternative utility of 11Î²-HSD-1 inhibition would be to bolster a temporal immune response in association with immunization to ensure that a cell based response would be obtained.\n\n\nRecent reports suggest that the levels of glucocorticoid target receptors 25 and of HSDs are connected with the susceptibility to glaucoma (J. Stokes et al., Invest. Ophthalmol. 2000, 41 : 1629-1638). Further, a connection between inhibition of 11Î²-HSD-1 and a lowering of the intraocular pressure was recently reported (Walker et al. , poster P3-698 at the Endocrine society meeting June 12-15, 1999, San Diego). It was shown that administration of the on nonspecific 11 Î²-HSD-1 inhibitor carbenoxolone resulted in the reduction of the intraocular pressure by 20% in normal patients. In the eye, 11Î²-HSD-1 is expressed exclusively in the basal cells of the corneal epithelium, the non- \n\n pigmented epithelium of the cornea (the site of aqueous production), ciliary muscle, and the sphincter and dilator muscles of the iris. In contrast, the distant isoenzyme 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (\"11-Î²-HSD-2\") is highly expressed in the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium and corneal endo- thelium. No HSDs have been found at the trabecular meshwork, which is the site of drainage. Therefore, 11-Î²-HSD-1 is suggested to have a role in aqueous production and inhibition of 11-Î²-HSD-1 activity is useful in reducing intraocular pressure in the treatment of glaucoma.\n\n\nGlucocorticoids also play an essential role in skeletal development and function but are detrimental to such development and function when present in excess. Glucocorticoid-induced bone loss is partially derived from suppression of osteoblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, as reported in C. H. Kim et al., J. Endocrinol. 1999, 162: 371 379. It has been reported that the detrimental effects of glucocorticoids on bone nodule formation can be less- ened by administration of carbenoxolone, which is a non-specific 11-Î²-HSD-1 inhibitor (C. G. Bellows et al., Bone 1998, 23: 119-125). Additional reports suggest that 11-Î²-HSD-1 maybe responsible for providing increased levels of active glucocorticoid in osteoclasts, and thus in augmenting bone resorption (M. S. Cooper et al., Bone 2000, 27: 375-381). This data suggests that inhibition of 11-Î²-HSD-1 may have beneficial effects against osteoporosis via one or more mechanisms which may act in parallel.\n\n\n11-Î²-HSD-1 inhibitors are known e.g. from the WO 04/10629, WO 03/065983, WO 04/089896, WO 04/089380, WO 04/065351 , WO 04/033427 or WO 04/041264.

The separation of the compounds of the invention can take place by column separation on chiral or nonchiral phases or by recrystallization from an optionally optically active solvent or with use of an optically active acid or base or by derivatization with an optically active reagent such as, for example, an optically active alcohol, and \n\n subsequent elimination of the radical.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be present in the form of their double bond isomers as \"pure\" E or Z isomers, or in the form of mixtures of these double bond isomers.\n\n\nWhere possible, the compounds of the invention may be in the form of the tautomers, such as keto-enol tautomers.\n\n\nIt is likewise possible for the compounds of the invention to be in the form of any desired prodrugs such as, for example, esters, carbonates, car- bamates, ureas, amides or phosphates, in which cases the actually biologically active form is released only through metabolism. Any compound that can be converted in vivo to provide the bioactive agent (i.e. compounds of the invention) is a prodrug within the scope and spirit of the invention.\n\n\nVarious forms of prodrugs are well known in the art and are described for instance in:\n\n\n(i) Wermuth CG et al., Chapter 31 : 671-696, The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, Academic Press 1996;\n\n\n(ii) Bundgaard H, Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier 1985; and (iii) Bundgaard H, Chapter 5: 131-191 , A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, Harwood Academic Publishers 1991.\n\n\nSaid references are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nIt is further known that chemical substances are converted in the body into metabolites which may where appropriate likewise elicit the desired bio- logical effect - in some circumstances even in more pronounced form.\n\n\nAny biologically active compound that was converted in vivo by metabolism from any of the compounds of the invention is a metabolite within the scope and spirit of the invention.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention can, if they have a sufficiently basic group such as, for example, a secondary or tertiary amine, be converted with \n\n inorganic and organic acids into salts. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention are preferably formed with hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, iodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesul- fonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, carbonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, sul-\n\n\n5 foacetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, racemic acid, malic acid, embonic acid, mandelic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, citric acid, taurocholic acid, glutaric acid, stearic acid, glutamic acid or aspartic acid.

The stoichiometry of the salts formed from the compounds of the invention may moreover be an\n\n\n15 integral or non-integral multiple of one.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention can, if they contain a sufficiently acidic group such as, for example, the carboxy, sulfonic acid, phosphoric acid or a phenolic group, be converted with inorganic and organic bases into their physiologically tolerated salts. Examples of suitable inorganic bases are am- \n20\n monium, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, and of organic bases are ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, ethyl- enediamine, t-butylamine, t-octylamine, dehydroabietylamine, cyclohexyl- amine, dibenzylethylene-diamine and lysine.

It is moreover possible for one, two, three or any number of solvate or water molecules to combine with the compounds of the invention to give solvates and hydrates.\n\n\nBy the term \"solvate\" is meant a hydrate, an alcoholate, or other solvate \n\n of crystallization.\n\n\nIt is known that chemical substances form solids which exist in different order states which are referred to as polymorphic forms or modifications. The various modifications of a polymorphic substance may differ greatly in their physical properties. The compounds of the invention can exist in various polymorphic forms and certain modifications may moreover be metastable. All these polymorphic forms of the compounds are to be regarded as belonging to the invention.\n\n\nThe compounds can be prepared by general method A, B and C shown below. In all preparative methods, all starting material is known or may easily be prepared from known starting materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod A - Coupling of piperazin to 1 eq acyl chloride or carboxyl chloride in a polar solvent at -20Â° to 50Â° C, most preferably 0Â° to 20Â° C \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod B - Coupling of piperazin to 1 eq isocyanate in a polar solvent at -20Â° to 50Â° C, most preferably 0Â° to 20Â° C \n\n\n\n\n\nMethod C - Coupling of piperazin to 1 eq sulfonyl chloride in a polar solvent at -20Â° to 50Â° C, most preferably 0Â° to 20Â° C \n\n\n \n\n Method D - Coupling of piperazin to 1 eq bromide in a polar solvent at - 20Â° to 50Â° C, most preferably 0Â° to 20Â° C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compounds of the formula (I) and also the starting materials for their preparation are, are prepared by methods as described in the examples or by methods known per se, as described in the literature (for example in standard works, such as Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart; Organic Reactions, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York), to be precise under reaction conditions which are known and suitable for the said reactions. Use can also be made here of variants which are known per se, but are not mentioned here in greater detail.\n\n\nThe starting materials for the claimed process may, if desired, also be formed in situ by not isolating them from the reaction mixture, but instead immediately converting them further into the compounds of the formula (I). On the other hand, it is possible to carry out the reaction stepwise.\n\n\nPreferably, the reaction of the compounds is carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent, which is preferably inert under the respective reaction conditions. Examples of suitable solvents are hydrocarbons, such as hexane, petroleum ether, benzene, toluene or xylene; chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as trichlorethylene, 1 ,2-dichloroethane, tetrachloromethane, chloroform or di- chloromethane; alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n- propanol, n-butanol or tert-butanol; ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dioxane; glycol ethers, such as ethylene gly- col monomethyl or monoethyl ether or ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (di- glyme); ketones, such as acetone or butanone; amides, such as acetamide, dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methyl pyrrolidinone \n\n (NMP); nitriles, such as acetonitrile; sulfoxides, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); nitro compounds, such as nitromethane or nitrobenzene; esters, such as ethyl acetate, or mixtures of the said solvents or mixtures with water. Polar solvents are in general preferred. Examples for suitable polar solvents are chlorinated hydrocarbons, alcohols, glycol ethers, nitriles, amides and sulfoxides or mixtures thereof. More preferred are amides, especially di- methylformamide (DMF).\n\n\nAs stated above, the reaction temperature is between about -100Â° C and\n\n\n300Â° C, depending on the reaction step and the conditions used.\n\n\nReaction times are generally in the range between some minutes and several days, depending on the reactivity of the respective compounds and the respective reaction conditions. Suitable reaction times are readily deter- minable by methods known in the art, for example reaction monitoring. Based on the reaction temperatures given above, suitable reaction times generally lie in the range between 10 min and 48 hrs.\n\n\nA base of the formula (I) can be converted into the associated acid- addition salt using an acid, for example by reaction of equivalent amounts of the base and the acid in a preferably inert solvent, such as ethanol, followed by evaporation. Suitable acids for this reaction are, in particular, those which give physiologically acceptable salts. Thus, it is possible to use inorganic acids, for example sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid, dithionic acid, nitric acid, hydro- halic acids, such as hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acids, such as, for example, orthophosphoric acid, sulfamic acid, furthermore organic acids, in particular aliphatic, alicyclic, araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic monobasic or polybasic carboxylic, sulfonic or sulfuric acids, for example formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, hexanoic acid, octanoic acid, de- canoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid, pivalic acid, diethylacetic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, pimelic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, gluconic acid, ascorbic acid, nicotinic acid, isonicotinic acid, methane- or ethanesulfonic acid, ethanedisulfonic \n\n acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, trimethoxybenzoic acid, adamantanecarboxylic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, glycolic acid, em- bonic acid, chlorophenoxyacetic acid, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, proline, glyoxylic acid, palmitic acid, parachlorophenoxyisobutyric acid, cyclohexane- carboxylic acid, glucose 1 -phosphate, naphthalenemono- and -disulfonic acids or laurylsulfuric acid.\n\n\nSalts with physiologically unacceptable acids, for example picrates, can be used to isolate and/or purify the compounds of the formula (I).\n\n\nOn the other hand, compounds of the formula (I) can be converted into the corresponding metal salts, in particular alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts, or into the corresponding ammonium salts, using bases (for example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate). Suitable salts are furthermore substituted ammonium salts, for example the dimethyl-, diethyl- and diisopropylammonium salts, mono- ethanol-, diethanol- and diisopropanolammonium salts, cyclohexyl- and dicy- clohexylammonium salts, dibenzylethylenediammonium salts, furthermore, for example, salts with arginine or lysine.\n\n\nIf desired, the free bases of the formula (I) can be liberated from their salts by treatment with strong bases, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, so long as no further acidic groups are present in the molecule. In the cases where the compounds of the formula (I) have free acid groups, salt formation can likewise be achieved by treatment with bases. Suitable bases are alkali metal hydrox- ides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides or organic bases in the form of primary, secondary or tertiary amines.\n\n\nEvery reaction step described herein can optionally be followed by one or more working up procedures and/or isolating procedures. Suitable such pro- cedures are known in the art, for example from standard works, such as\n\n\nHouben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart). Examples for such procedures \n\n include, but are not limited to evaporating a solvent, distilling, crystallization, fractionised crystallization, extraction procedures, washing procedures, digesting procedures, filtration procedures, chromatography, chromatography by HPLC and drying procedures, especially drying procedures in vacuo and/or elevated temperature.\n\n\nThe object of the present invention has surprisingly been solved in another aspect by providing a process of manufacturing a compound of the invention, comprising the steps: a)4-thiocarbamoyl-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester is reacted with ethyl bromopyruvate to yield 4-(2-ethoxycarbonyl-2-oxo- ethylsulanylcarbonimidoyl)-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (\"addition reaction\"), and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb)4-(2-ethoxycarbonyl-2-oxo-ethylsulanylcarbonimidoyl)-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester is converted into 4-(4-ethoxycarbonyl-thiazol-2-yl)- piperidine-1-carboxylic acid ter-butyl ester (\"cyclization\"), and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc)4-(4-ethoxycarbonyl-thiazol-2-yl)-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid ter-butyl ester is reacted with an acid to yield 4-(4-carboxy-thiazol-2-yl)-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid ter-butyl ester (\"acidification 1\"), and \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nd)4-(4-carboxy-thiazol-2-yl)-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid ter-butyl ester is reacted with R1-NH-R2, where R1 , R2 have the meaning as defined above, to yield 4-{4-(R1R2N-carbonyl)-thiazol-2-yl}-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid ter-butyl es- ter (\"amidation\"), and\n\n\n \n\n e)4-{4-(R1 R2N-carbonyl)-thiazol-2-yl}-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid ter-butyl ester is reacted with an acid to yield 4-{4-(R1R2N-carbonyl)-thiazol-2-yl}-piperidine (\"acidification 2\"), and\n\n\n \n\n f-|) 4-{4-(R1 R2N-carbonyl)-thiazol-2-yl}-piperidine is reacted with acyl chloride to yield 4-{4-(R1R2N-carbonyl)-thiazol-2-yl}-piperidine-1-carbonyl-R3 (\"acyla- tion\"), where R3 has the meaning as defined above, or\n\n\n \n\n f2) 4-{4-(R1R2N-carbonyl)-thiazol-2-yl}-piperidine is reacted with isocyanate to yield 4-{4-(R1 R2N-carbonyl)-thiazol-2-yl}-piperidine-1-carbamoyl-R3 (\"car- bamoylation\"), where R3 has the meaning as defined above, or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf3) 4-{4-(R1 R2N-carbonyl)-thiazol-2-yl}-piperidine is reacted with sulfonyl chlo- ride to yield 4-{4-(R1 R2N-carbonyl)-thiazol-2-yl}-piperidine-1-sulfonyl-R3 (\"sulfonylation\"), where R3 has the meaning as defined above, or\n\n\n \n\n f4) 4-{4-(R1 R2N-carbonyl)-thiazol-2-yl}-piperidine is reacted with carboxy- chloride to yield 4-{4-(R1 R2N-carbonyl)-thiazol-2-yl}-piperidine-1-carboxyl-R3 (\"carboxylation\"), where R3 has the meaning as defined above, or\n\n\n \n\n f5) 4-{4-(R1R2N-carbonyl)-thiazol-2-yl}-piperidine is reacted with a bromide to yield 4-{4-(R1R2N-carbonyl)-thiazol-2-yl}-piperidine-1-R3 (\"alkylation\"), where R3 has the meaning as defined above.\n\n\n \n\n The compounds of the invention are surprisingly characterized by a strong and/or selective inhibition of 11-Î²-HSD-1 enzyme.\n\n\nDue to their surprisingly strong and/or selective enzyme inhibition, the compounds of the invention can be advantageously administered at lower doses compared to other less potent or selective inhibitors of the prior art while still achieving equivalent or even superior desired biological effects. In addition, such a dose reduction may advantageously lead to less or even no medicinal adverse effects. Further, the high inhibition selectivity of the compounds of the invention may translate into a decrease of undesired side effects on its own regardless of the dose applied.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention are selective inhibitors of the 11-Î²-HSD- 1 enzyme. Thus, the present invention relates to the use of the compounds of the present invention for inhibiting the reductase activity of 11-Î²- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase- 1, which is responsible for the conversion of cortisone to Cortisol.\n\n\n \n2n\n The compounds of the invention being 11-Î²-HSD-1 inhibitors generally have an inhibition constant IC50 of less than about 500 nM, and preferably less than about 100 nM. Generally, the IC50 ratio 11-Î²-HSD-2 to 11-Î²-HSD-1 of a compound of the invention is at least about two or more, and preferably about ten or greater. Even more preferred are compounds with an IC50 ratio\n\n\n25 for 11-Î²-HSD-2 to 11-Î²-HSD-1 of about 20 or greater. For example, compounds of the present invention ideally demonstrate an inhibition constant IC50 against 11-Î²-HSD-2 greater than about 1000 nM, and preferably greater than 5000 nM.\n\n\nThe present invention includes the use of an 11-Î²-HSD-1 inhibitor for the on o\nÏ\n treatment, control, amelioration, prevention, delaying the onset of or reducing the risk of developing physiological and pathophysiological conditions that are described herein, as mediated by excess or uncontrolled amounts of cor- \n\n tisol and/or other corticosteroids in a mammalian patient, particularly a human, by the administration of an effective amount of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.

In this case, it is within the specialist knowledge of the average person skilled in the art to measure and determine such inhibiting, inhibition, and/or retardation by means of the usual methods of measurement and determination.

As used herein, the term \"effective amount\" means that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is be- ing sought, for instance, by a researcher or clinician. Furthermore, the term\n\n\n\"therapeutically effective amount\" means any amount which, as compared to a corresponding subject who has not received such amount, results in improved treatment, healing, prevention, or amelioration of a disease, disorder, or side effect, or a decrease in the rate of advancement of a disease or dis- order. The term also includes within its scope amounts effective to enhance normal physiological function. Said therapeutic effective amount of one or more of the compounds of the invention is known to the skilled artisan or can be easily determined by standard methods known in the art.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention and the additional active substances are generally administered analogously to commercial preparations. Usually, suitable doses that are therapeutically effective lie in the range between 0.0005 mg and 1000 mg, preferably between 0.005 mg and 500 mg and especially between 0.5 mg and 100 mg per dose unit. The daily dose is preferably between about 0.001 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of body weight.\n\n\nThose of skill will readily appreciate that dose levels can vary as a function of the specific compound, the severity of the symptoms and the susceptibility of the subject to side effects. Some of the specific compounds are more potent than others. Preferred dosages for a given compound are readily determinable by those of skill in the art by a variety of means. A preferred means is to measure the physiological potency of a given compound.\n\n\nFor the purpose of the present invention, all mammalian species are regarded as being comprised. In a preferred embodiment, such mammals are selected from the group consisting of \"primate, human, rodent, equine, bovine, canine, feline, domestic animals, cattle, livestock, pets, cow, sheep, pig, goat, horse, pony, donkey, hinny, mule, hare, rabbit, cat, dog, guinea pig, \n\n hamster, rat, mouse\". More preferably, such mammals are humans. Animal models are of interest for experimental investigations, providing a model for treatment of human diseases.\n\n\nThe specific dose for the individual patient depends, however, on the multitude of factors, for example on the efficacy of the specific compounds employed, on the age, body weight, general state of health, the sex, the kind of diet, on the time and route of administration, on the excretion rate, the kind of administration and the dosage form to be administered, the pharmaceutical combination and severity of the particular disorder to which the therapy relates. The specific therapeutic effective dose for the individual patient can readily be determined by routine experimentation, for example by the doctor or physician, which advises or attends the therapeutic treatment. In the case of many disorders, the susceptibility of a particular cell to treatment with the subject compounds may be determined by in vitro testing. Typically a culture of the cell is combined with a subject compound at varying concentrations for a period of time sufficient to allow the active agents to show a relevant reaction, usually between about one hour and one week. For in vitro testing, cultured cells from a biopsy sample may be used.\n\n\nEven without further details, it is assumed that a person skilled in the art will be able to utilise the above description in the broadest scope. The preferred embodiments should therefore merely be regarded as descriptive disclosure, which is absolutely not limiting in any way.\n\n\nAbove and below, all temperatures are indicated in Â°C.

The invention further relates to cells comprising such proteins, polynucleotide encoding such proteins or fragments thereof, and to vectors comprising the polynucleotides encoding the innovative proteins.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nFibronectin based scaffolds are a family of proteins capable of evolving to bind any compound of interest. These proteins, which generally make use of a scaffold derived from a fibronectin type III (Fn3) or Fn3-like domain, function in a manner characteristic of natural or engineered antibodies (that is, polyclonal, monoclonal, or single-chain antibodies) and, in addition, possess structural advantages. Specifically, the structure of these antibody mimics has been designed for optimal folding, stability, and solubility, even under conditions that normally lead to the loss of structure and function in antibodies. An example of fibronectin- based scaffold proteins are Adnectinsâ¢ (Adnexus, a Bristol-Myers Squibb R&D Company).\n\n\nFibronectin is a large protein which plays essential roles in the formation of extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions; it consists of many repeats of three types (types I, II, and III) of small domains (Baron et al., 1991 ). Fn3 itself is the paradigm of a large subfamily which includes portions of cell adhesion molecules, cell surface hormone and cytokine receptors, chaperoning, and carbohydrate-binding domains. For reviews see Bork & Doolittle, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Oct \n\n l ;89(19):8990-4; Bork et al., J MoI Biol. 1994 Sep 30;242(4):309-20; Campbell & Spitzfaden, Structure. 1994 May 15;2(5):333-7; Harpez & Chothia, J MoI Biol. 1994 May l 3;238(4):528-39).\n\n\nFibronectin type 111 (Fn3) domains comprise, in order from N-terminus to C- terminus, a beta or beta-like strand, A; a loop, AB; a beta or beta-like strand, B; a loop, BC; a beta or beta-like strand, C; a loop, CD; a beta or beta-like strand, D; a loop, DE; a beta or beta-like strand, E; a loop, EF; a beta or beta-like strand, F; a loop, FG; and a beta or beta-like strand, G. Any or all of loops AB, BC, CD, DE, EF and FG may participate in target binding. The BC, DE, and FG loops are both structurally and functionally analogous to the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from immunoglobulins. U.S. Patent No. 7,1 15,396 describes Fn3 domain proteins wherein alterations to the BC, DE, and FG loops result in high affinity TNFÎ± binders. U.S. Publication No. 2007/0148126 describes Fn3 domain proteins wherein alterations to the BC, DE, and FG loops result in high affinity VEGFR2 binders.\n\n\nIt would be advantageous to obtain improved fibronectin domain scaffold proteins for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. The present disclosure provides such improved proteins.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nOne aspect of the application provides for multivalent polypeptides comprising an N-terminal domain comprising a first fibronectin type III tenth domain (\nl 0\nFn3) that binds to a first target molecule with a K\nD\n of less than 500 nM and a C-terminal domain comprising a second \n10\nFn3 that binds to a second target molecule with a KQ of less than 500 nM.

Polypeptides can include natural amino acids and non-natural amino acids such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 6,559,126, incorporated herein by reference. Polypeptides can also be modified in any of a variety of standard chemical ways (e.g., an amino acid can be modified with a protecting group; the carboxy-terminal amino acid can be made into a terminal amide group; the amino-terminal residue can be modified with groups to, e.g., enhance lipophilicity; or the polypeptide can be chemically glycosylated or otherwise modified to increase stability or in vivo half-life). Polypeptide modifications can include the attachment of another structure such as a cyclic compound or other molecule to the polypeptide and can also include polypeptides that contain one or more amino acids in an altered configuration (i.e., R or S; or, L or D).\n\n\nThe term \"PK\" is an acronym for \"pharmokinetic\" and encompasses properties of a compound including, by way of example, absorbtion, distribution, metabolism, and elimination by a subject. A \"PK modulation protein\" or \"PK moiety\" refers to any protein, peptide, or moiety that affects the pharmokinetic properties of a biologically active molecule when fused to or administered together with the biologically active molecule. Examples of a PK modulation protein or PK moiety include PEG, human serum albumin (HSA) binders (as disclosed in U.S. Publication Nos. 20050287153 and 20070003549), human serum albumin, Fc or Fc fragments, and sugars (e.g., sialic acid).\n\n\nA \"functional Fc region\" possesses at least one \"effector function\" of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary \"effector functions\" include C I q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); Fc receptor binding; antibody- dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g., B cell receptor; BCR), etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain (e.g., an \n\n antibody variable domain) and can be assessed using various assays known in the art for evaluating such antibody effector functions.\n\n\nA \"native sequence Fc region\" comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. A \"variant Fc region\" comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide, e.g., from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80% sequence identity with a native sequence Fc region and/or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide, and most preferably at least about 90% sequence identity therewith, more preferably at least about 95% sequence identity therewith. \"Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity\" and \"ADCC\" refer to a cell-mediated reaction in which nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc receptors (FcRs) (e.g., Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcÎ³RIII only, whereas monocytes express FcÎ³RI, FcÎ³RII and FcÎ³RIII. To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,500,362 or 5,821 ,337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. PNAS (USA) 95:652-656 ( 1998).\n\n\n\"Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity\" herein is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in a selected sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be \n\n achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN, ALIGN-2 or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full-length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are obtained as described below by using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc. has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.

The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary. For purposes herein, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows: 100 times the fraction X/Y where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A.\n\n\nAn \"isolated\" polypeptide is one that has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the polypeptide, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified ( 1 ) to greater than 95% by weight of polypeptide as determined by the Lovyry method, and most preferably more than \n\n 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated polypeptide includes the polypeptide in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the polypeptide's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated polypeptide will be prepared by at least one purification step.\n\n\nTargets may also be fragments of said targets. Thus a target is also a fragment of said target, capable of eliciting an immune response. A target is also a fragment of said target, capable of binding to a single domain antibody raised against the full length target.\n\n\nA fragment as used herein refers to less than 100% of the sequence (e.g., 99%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10% etc.), but comprising 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1 1 , 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 22, 23, 24, 25 or more amino acids. A fragment is of sufficient length such that the interaction of interest is maintained with affinity of 1 x 10 \n6\n M or better.\n\n\nA fragment as used herein also refers to optional insertions, deletions and substitutions of one or more amino acids which do not substantially alter the ability of the target to bind to a single domain antibody raised against the wild-type target. The number of amino acid insertions deletions or substitutions is preferably up to 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1 1 , 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 , 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 , 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51 , 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61 , 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 or 70 amino acids. The term \"therapeutically effective amount\" refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat a disease or disorder in a mammal. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the disorder. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be \n\n cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy in vivo can, for example, be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and/or determining the response rates (RR).\n\n\nThe half-life of an amino acid sequence or compound can generally be defined as the time taken for the serum concentration of the polypeptide to be reduced by 50%, in vivo, for example due to degradation of the sequence or compound and/or clearance or sequestration of the sequence or compound by natural mechanisms. The half-life can be determined in any manner known per se, such as by pharmacokinetic analysis. Suitable techniques will be clear to the person skilled in the art, and may for example generally involve the steps of suitably administering to the primate a suitable dose of the amino acid sequence or compound to be treated; collecting blood samples or other samples from said primate at regular intervals; determining the level or concentration of the amino acid sequence or compound of the invention in said blood sample; and calculating, from (a plot of) the data thus obtained, the time until the level or concentration of the amino acid sequence or compound of the invention has been reduced by 50% compared to the initial level upon dosing. Reference is for example made to to the standard handbooks, such as Kenneth, A et al: Chemical Stability of Pharmaceuticals: A Handbook for Pharmacists and in Peters et al, Pharmacokinete analysis: A Practical Approach (1996). Reference is also made to \"Pharmacokinetics\", M Gibaldi & D Perron, published by Marcel Dekker, 2nd Rev. edition (1982).\n\n\nHalf-life can be expressed using parameters such as the tl/2-alpha, tl/2-beta and the area under the curve (AUC). In the present specification, an \"increase in half-life\" refers to an increase in any one of these parameters, such as any two of these parameters, or essentially all three these parameters. An \"increase in half-life\" in particular refers to an increase in the tl/2-beta, either with or without an increase in the tl/2-alpha and/or the AUC or both.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"multivalent\" refers to a recombinant molecule that incorporates two or more biologically active segments. The protein fragments forming the multivalent molecule optionally may be linked through a polypeptide linker which attaches the constituent parts and permits each to function independently. \n\n Overview\n\n\nThe application provides multivalent polypeptides comprising two or more fibronectin based scaffold proteins, such as Fn3 domains. The Fn3 domains may bind to the same target, thereby increasing the valency and thus the avidity of target binding, or to different targets, thereby demonstrating multiple effector functions.\n\n\nU.S. Patent No 6,818,418 describes fibronectin scaffold multimers that may be linked covalently or non-covalently The present application describes improved multimers that are covalently bonded via polypeptide linkers, allowing a multivalent polypeptide to be expressed as a single construct. The application relates, in part, on the surprising discovery that Fn3 domains joined via a polypeptide linker correctly fold independently of each other, retain high affinity binding, and that each of the domains retains its functional properties\n\n\nFibronectin based scaffolds\n\n\nOne aspect of the application provides for polypeptides comprising at least two Fn3 domains, each binding a target molecule, linked via a polypeptide. Each Fn3 domain comprises an AB loop, a BC loop, a CD loop, a DE loop, an EF loop, and an FG loop In some embodiments, the Fn3 domain is an Fn3 domain derived from human fibronectin, particularly the tenth Fn3 domain of fibronectin (\nl0\nFn3), as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. A variety of mutant \nl0\nFn3 scaffolds have been reported. In one aspect, one or more of Asp 7, GIu 9, and Asp 23 is replaced by another amino acid, such as, for example, a non-ncgatively charged amino acid residue (e.g., Asn, Lys, etc.). These mutations have been reported to have the effect of promoting greater stability of the mutant \nl 0\nFn3 at neutral pH as compared to the wild-type form (See, PCT Publication No WO02/04523) A variety of additional alterations in the \nlÏ\nFn3 scaffold that are either beneficial or neutral have been disclosed. See, for example, Baton et al., Protein Eng. 2002 Dec; 15( 12): 1015-20; Koide et al., Biochemistry 2001 Aug 28;40(34).10326-33.\n\n\nBoth variant and wild-type \nl Ï\nFn3 proteins are characterized by the same structure, namely seven beta-strand domain sequences designated A through G and \n\n six loop regions (AB loop, BC loop, CD loop, DE loop, EF loop, and FG loop) which connect the seven beta-strand domain sequences. The beta strands positioned closest to the N- and C-termini may adopt a beta-like conformation in solution. In SEQ ID NO:1 , the AB loop corresponds to residues 15-16, the BC loop corresponds to residues 21-30, the CD loop corresponds to residues 39-45, the DE loop corresponds to residues 51-56, the EF loop corresponds to residues 60-66, and the FG loop corresponds to residues 76-87 (Xu et al., Chemistry & Biology 2002 9:933- 942). The BC, DE and FG loops align along one face of the molecule and the AB, CD and EF loops align along the opposite face of the molecule. In SEQ ID NO: 1 , beta strand A corresponds to residues 9- 14, beta strand B corresponds to residues 17-20, beta strand C corresponds to residues 31 -38, beta strand D corresponds to residues 46-50, beta strand E corresponds to residues 57-59, beta strand F corresponds to residues 67-75, and beta strand G corresponds to residues 88-94. The strands are connected to each other through the corresponding loop, e.g., strands A and B are connected via loop AB in the formation strand A, loop AB, strand B, etc. Residues involved in forming the hydrophobic core (the \"core amino acid residues\") include the amino acids corresponding to the following amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 1 : L8, VlO, A13, Ll 8, 120, W22, Y32, 134, Y36, F48, V50, A57, 159, L62, Y68, 170, V72, A74, 188, 190 and Y92, wherein the core amino acid residues are represented by the single letter amino acid code followed by the position at which they are located within SEQ ID NO: 1. See e.g., Dickinson et al., J. MoI. Biol. 236: 1079- 1092 (1994).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the \nl 0\nFn3 polypeptide may be at least 40%, 50%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, or 90% identical to the human \n10\nFn3 domain, shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. Much of the variability will generally occur in one or more of the loops. Each of the beta or beta-like strands of a \nl 0\nFn3 polypeptide may consist essentially of an amino acid sequence that is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 100% identical to the sequence of a corresponding beta or beta-like strand of SEQ ID NO: 1 , provided that such variation does not disrupt the stability of the polypeptide in physiological conditions.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the disclosure provides polypeptides comprising a tenth fibronectin type 111 (\nl 0\nFn3) domain, wherein the \nl0\nFn3 domain comprises a \n\n loop, AB; a loop, BC; a loop, CD; a loop, DE; a loop, EF; and a loop, FG; and has at least one loop selected from loop BC, DE, and FG with an altered amino acid sequence relative to the sequence of the corresponding loop of the human \nl0\nFn3 domain. In some embodiments, the BC and FG loops are altered. In some embodiments, the BC, DE, and FG loops are altered, i.e., the Fn3 domains comprise non-naturally occurring loops. By \"altered\" is meant one or more amino acid sequence alterations relative to a template sequence (corresponding human fibronectin domain) and includes amino acid additions, deletions, and substitutions. Altering an amino acid sequence may be accomplished through intentional, blind, or spontaneous sequence variation, generally of a nucleic acid coding sequence, and may occur by any technique, for example, PCR, error-prone PCR, or chemical DNA synthesis..\n\n\nIn some embodiments, one or more loops selected from BC, DE, and FG may be extended or shortened in length relative to the corresponding human fibronectin loop. In some embodiments, the length of the loop may be extended by from 2-25 amino acids. In some embodiments, the length of the loop may be decreased by 1 -1 1 amino acids. In particular, the FG loop of \nlÏ\nFn3 is 12 residues long, whereas the corresponding loop in antibody heavy chains ranges from 4-28 residues. To optimize antigen binding, therefore, the length of the FG loop of \n10\nFn3 may be altered in length as well as in sequence to cover the CDR3 range of 4-28 residues to obtain the greatest possible flexibility and affinity in antigen binding.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises a first Fn3 domain that comprises an amino acid sequence at least 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, or 100% identical to the non-loop regions of SEQ ID NO: 1 , wherein at least one loop selected from BC, DE, and FG is altered. In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises a second Fn3 domain that comprises an amino acid sequence at least 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, or 100% identical to the non-loop regions of SEQ ID NO: 1 , wherein at least one loop selected from BC, DE, and FG is altered. In some embodiments, the altered BC loop has up to 10 amino acid substitutions, up to 4 amino acid deletions, up to 10 amino acid insertions, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the altered DE loop has up to 6 amino acid substitutions, up to 4 amino acid deletions, up to 13 amino acid insertions or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the FG loop has up \n\n to 12 amino acid substitutions, up to 1 1 amino acid deletions, up to 25 amino acid insertions or a combination thereof.\n\n\nThe \nl 0\nFn3 domains generally begin with amino acid number 1 of SEQ ID NO: 1. However, domains with amino acid deletions are also encompassed by the invention. In some embodiments, the first eight amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 1 are deleted. Additional sequences may also be added to the N- or C-terminus. For example, an additional MG sequence may be placed at the N -terminus of an Fn3 domain, in particular at the N-terminus of the first Fn3 domain. The M will usually be cleaved off, leaving a G at the N-terminus. In some embodiments, sequences may be placed at the C-terminus of the \nlÏ\nFn3 domain, e.g., SEQ ID NOS: 17, 18, or 19. In other embodiments, sequences placed at the C-terminus may be a C-terminally truncated fragment of SEQ ID NOs: 17, 18 or 19, including, for example, one of the following amino acid sequences (represented by the single letter amino acid code): E, EI, EID, EIDKP (SEQ ID NO: 50), EIDKPS (SEQ ID NO: 51 ), or EIDKPC (SEQ ID NO: 52).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises a first and/or second \nl 0\nFn3 domain with a BC loop having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, a DE loop having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, and an FG loop having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, wherein the Fn3 domain binds IGF-IR. In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises a first and/or second \nl0\nFn3 domain with a BC loop having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, a DE loop having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6, and an FG loop having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7, wherein the Fn3 domain binds VEGFR2. In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 8-15, 29-31 and 63-70. In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100% identical to of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 8-15, 29-31 and 63-70.\n\n\nFibronectin naturally binds certain types of integrins through its integrin- binding motif, \"arginine-glycine-aspartic acid\" (RGD). In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises a \nl0\nFn3 domain that lacks the (RGD) integrin binding motif.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a multivalent polypeptide comprises a polypeptide having the structure A-B-C, wherein A is a polypeptide comprising, consisting \n\n essentially of, or consisting of a \nl 0\nFn3 domain that binds to VEGFR2, B is a polypeptide linker, and C is a polypeptide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a \nl 0\nFn3 domain that binds to IGF-IR. In another embodiment, a multivalent polypeptide comprises a polypeptide having the structure A-B-C, wherein A is a polypeptide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a \nl 0\nFn3 domain that binds to IGF-IR, B is a polypeptide linker, and C is a polypeptide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a \nl0\nFn3 domain that binds to VEGFR2.

In certain embodiments, the core amino acid residues are fixed and any substitutions, conservative substitutions, deletions or additions occur at residues other than the core amino acid residues. The \nl0\nFn3 domain that binds to IGF-IR may optionally comprise an N-terminal extension of from 1-20, 1-15, 1-10, 1-8, 1-5, 1-4, 1-3, 1-2, or 1 amino acids in length. Exemplary N-terminal extensions include (represented by the single letter amino acid code) M, MG, G, MGVSDVPRDL (SEQ ID NO: 45), VSDVPRDL (SEQ ID NO: 46), and \n\n GVSDVPRDL (SEQ ID NO: 48), or N-terminally truncated fragments of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 45, 46 or 48. Other suitable N-terminal extensions include, for example, X\nn\nSDVPRDL (SEQ ID NO: 53), X\nn\nDVPRDL (SEQ ID NO: 54), X\n11\nVPRDL (SEQ ID NO: 55), X\nn\nPRDL (SEQ ID NO: 56), X\nn\nRDL (SEQ ID NO: 57), X\nn\nDL (SEQ ID NO: 58), or X\nn\nL, wherein n = 0, 1 or 2 amino acids, wherein when n = 1 , X is Met or GIy, and when n = 2, X is Met-Gly. The \n10\nFn3 domain that binds to IGF-IR may optionally comprise a C-terminal tail. Exemplary C-terminal tails include polypeptides that are from 1-20, 1-15, 1 -10, 1-8, 1-5, 1-4, 1-3, 1-2, or 1 amino acids in length. Specific examples of C-terminal tails include EIDKPSQ (SEQ ID NO: 17), ElDKPCQ (SEQ ID NO: 18), and ElDK (SEQ ID NO: 19). In other embodiments, suitable C-terminal tails may be a C-terminally truncated fragment of SEQ ID NOs: 17, 18 or 19, including, for example, one of the following amino acid sequences (represented by the single letter amino acid code): E, EI, ElD, EIDKP (SEQ ID NO: 50), EIDKPS (SEQ ID NO: 51), or EIDKPC (SEQ ID NO: 52).

In certain embodiments, the \nl0\nFn3 domain that binds to IGF-IR comprises both an N-terminal extension and a C-terminal tail. In exemplary embodiments, the A region comprises an N-terminal extension beginning with GIy or Met-Gly and a C-terminal extension that does not contain a cysteine residue and the B region comprises an N-terminal extension that does not start with a Met and a C-terminal extension that comprises a cysteine residue. Specific examples of \n10\nFn3 domains that bind to IGF-IR are polypeptides comprising (i) a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 26-27 and 35-39, or (ii) a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to the amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 26-27 and 35-39.\n\n\nThe B region is a polypeptide linker. Exemplary polypeptide linkers include polypeptides having from 1 -20, 1 - 15, 1 -10, 1 -8, 1 -5, 1 -4, 1 -3, or 1 -2 amino acids. Specific examples of suitable polypeptide linkers are described further herein. In certain embodiments, the linker may be a C-terminal tail polypeptide as described herein, an N-terminal extension polypeptide as described herein, or a combination thereof. \n\n In one embodiment, a multivalent polypeptide comprises a polypeptide having the structure XpA-X\n2\n-B-X\n3\n-C-X\n4\n, wherein X| is an optional N-terminal extension, A is a \n1(\n Fn3 domain that binds to VEGFR2, X\n2\n is an optional C-terminal tail, B is a polypeptide hnkei, X\n3\n is an optional N-terminal extension, C is a \nl 0\nFn3 domain that binds to IGF-IR, and X\n4\n is an optional C-terminal tail In another embodiment, a multivalent polypeptide comprises a polypeptide having the structure Xi-A-X\n2\n-B-X\n3\n-C-X\n4\n, wherein X| is an optional N-terminal extension, A is a \nl0\nFn3 domain that binds to IGF-IR, X? is an optional C-terminal tail, B is a polypeptide linker, X\n3\n is an optional N-terminal extension, C is a \nl 0\nFn3 domain that binds to VEGFR2, and X\n4\n is an optional C-terminal tail Specific examples of suitable N- terminal extensions and C-terminal tails are described above In certain embodiments, one or more of Xi, X\n2\n, B, X\n3\n or X\n4\n may compiise an amino acid residue suitable for pegylation, such as a cysteine or lysine iesidue In exemplary embodiments, X\n4\n compiises at least one amino acid suitable for pegylation, such as a cysteine or lysine iesidue Specific examples of suitable polypeptide linkers are described further below Specific examples of multivalent polypeptides having the structure XpA-X\n2\n-B-X\n3\n-C-X\n4\n are polypeptides comprising (i) a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs 8-15, 29-31 and 63- 70, or (ii) a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to the amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs 8-15, 29-31 and 63-70\n\n\nIn exemplary embodiments, X as defined herein is a naturally occurring amino acid\n\n\nPolypeptide linkers\n\n\nThe application provides multivalent polypeptides comprising at least two Fn3 domains linked via a polypeptide linker The polypeptides comprise an N- terminal domain comprising a first Fn3 domain and a C-terminal domain comprising a second Fn3 domain The first and second Fn3 domains may be directly or indirectly linked via a polypeptide linker Additional linkers or spacers, e g , SEQ ID NOS 17, 18, or 19, may be introduced at the C-terminus of the first Fn3 domain between the Fn3 domain and the polypeptide hnkei Additional linkers or spacers \n\n may be introduced at the N-terminus of the second Fn3 domain between the Fn3 domain and the polypeptide linker.\n\n\nSuitable linkers for joining the Fn3 domains are those which allow the separate domains to fold independently of each other forming a three dimensional structure that permits high affinity binding to a target molecule. The application provides that suitable linkers that meet these requirements comprise glycine-serine based linkers, glycine-proline based linkers, proline-alanine based linkers as well as the linker SEQ ID NO: 20. The Examples described herein demonstrate that Fn3 domains joined via these linkers retain their target binding function. In some embodiments, the linker is a glycine-serine based linker. These linkers comprise glycine and serine residues and may be between 8 and 50, 10 and 30, and 10 and 20 amino acids in length. Examples of such linkers include SEQ ID NOS: 23, 24, and 25. In some embodiments the polypeptide linker is selected from SEQ ID NOS: 21 and 22. In some embodiments, the linker is a glycine-proline based linker. These linkers comprise glycine and proline residues and may be between 3 and 30, 10 and 30, and 3 and 20 amino acids in length. Examples of such linkers include SEQ ID NOS: 32, 33, and 34. In some embodiments, the linker is a proline-alanine based linker. These linkers comprise proline and alanine residues and may be between 3 and 30, 10 and 30, 3 and 20 and 6 and 18 amino acids in length. Examples of such linkers include SEQ ID NOS: 60, 61 and 62. It is contemplated, that the optimal linker length and amino acid composition may be determined by routine experimentation by methods well known in the art. In some embodiments, the polypeptide linker is SEQ ID NO: 20.\n\n\nPharmacokinetic moieties\n\n\nIn one aspect, the application provides for multivalent polypeptides further comprising a pharmacokinetic (PK) moiety. Improved pharmacokinetics may be assessed according to the perceived therapeutic need. Often it is desirable to increase bioavailability and/or increase the time between doses, possibly by increasing the time that a protein remains available in the serum after dosing. In some instances, it is desirable to improve the continuity of the serum concentration of the protein over time (e.g., decrease the difference in serum concentration of the protein shortly after \n\n administration and shortly before the next administration). The polypeptides may be attached to a moiety that reduces the clearance rate of the polypeptide in a mammal (e.g., mouse, rat, or human) by greater than three-fold relative to the unmodified polypeptide. Other measures of improved pharmacokinetics may include serum half- life, which is often divided into an alpha phase and a beta phase. Either or both phases may be improved significantly by addition of an appropriate moiety.\n\n\nMoieties that tend to slow clearance of a protein from the blood, herein referred to as \"PK moieties\", include polyoxyalkylene moieties, e.g., polyethylene glycol, sugars (e.g., sialic acid), and well-tolerated protein moieties (e.g., Fc, Fc fragments, transferrin, or serum albumin). The polypeptides may be fused to albumin or a fragment (portion) or variant of albumin as described in U.S. Publication No. 20070048282.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the PK moiety is a serum albumin binding protein such as those described in U.S. Publication Nos. 2007/0178082 and 2007/0269422. In some embodiments, the PK moiety is a serum immunoglobulin binding protein such as those described in U.S. Publication No. 2007/0178082.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the multivalent polypeptide comprises polyethylene glycol (PEG). One or more PEG molecules may be attached at different positions on the protein, and such attachment may be achieved by reaction with amines, thiols or other suitable reactive groups. The amine moiety may be, for example, a primary amine found at the N-terminus of a polypeptide or an amine group present in an amino acid, such as lysine or arginine. In some embodiments, the PEG moiety is attached at a position on the polypeptide selected from the group consisting of: a) the N-terminus; b) between the N-terminus and the most N-terminal beta strand or beta-like strand; c) a loop positioned on a face of the polypeptide opposite the target- binding site; d) between the C-terminus and the most C-terminal beta strand or beta- like strand; and e) at the C-terminus.\n\n\nPegylation may be achieved by site-directed pegylation, wherein a suitable reactive group is introduced into the protein to create a site where pegylation preferentially occurs. In some embodiments, the protein is modified to introduce a cysteine residue at a desired position, permitting site directed pegylation on the cysteine. In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises a Cys containing linker \n\n such as SEQ ID NO: 18, which permits site directed pegylation. In some embodiments, the Cys containing linker is introduced at the 3' end of the second Fn3 domain (i.e., the domain most C-terminal in the polypeptide). PEG may vary widely in molecular weight and may be branched or linear. In some embodiments, the multivalent polypeptide comprises an Fn3 domain and a PK moiety. In some embodiments, the Fn3 domain is a \nl0\nFn3 domain. In some embodiments, the PK moiety increases the serum half-life of the polypeptide by more than 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 150, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000% or more relative to the Fn3 domain alone. In some embodiments, the PK moiety is linked to the Fn3 domain via at least one disulfide bond, a peptide bond, a polypeptide, a polymeric sugar, or a polyethylene glycol moiety. Exemplary polypeptide linkers include PSTSTST (SEQ ID NO: 20), EIDKPSQ (SEQ ID NO: 17), and GS linkers, such as GSGSGSGSGS (SEQ ID NO: 21 ) and multimers thereof. In some embodiments the PK moiety is human serum albumin. In some embodiments, the PK moiety is transferrin.\n\n\nTarget\n\n\nThe application provides multivalent polypeptides comprising a first Fn3 domain that binds to a first target molecule and a second Fn3 domain that binds to a second target molecule. The first and second target molecules may be the same or different target molecules. When the first and second target molecules are the same, the Fn3 domains, i.e., the binding loops, may be the same or different. Therefore, the first and second Fn3 domains may bind to the same target but at different epitopes. By introducing sequence variation in the loop regions, in particular loops BC, DE, and FG, Fn3 domains can be generated that can bind to almost any target molecule.\n\n\nPolypeptide binding to a target molecule may be assessed in teÏns of equilibrium constants (e.g., dissociation, KQ) and in teÏns of kinetic constants (e.g., on rate constant, k\non\n and off rate constant, k\nO\nÎ¹Ï). An Fn3 domain will generally bind to a target molecule with a K\nD\n of less than 500 nM, 100 nM, 1 nM, 500 pM, 100 pM or less, although higher K\nD\n values may be tolerated where the k\nO\nÎ¹Ï is sufficiently low or the k\noÏ\n is sufficiently high. \n\n In some embodiments, the first and/or second Fn3 domain binds a target selected from IGF-IR, FGFR, FGFRl , FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, FGFR5, c-Kit, human pi 85 receptor-like tyrosine kinase, EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4, c-Met, folate receptor, PDGFR, VEGFRl , VEGFR2, VEGFR3, human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, human CD20, human CD 18, human CDl Ia, human apoptosis receptor-2 (Apo-2), human alpha4beta7 lntegÏn, human GPIIb-IIIa lntegrin, stem cell factor (SCF), human CD3, IGF-IR, Angl , Ang2, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, or Tie2 3. In some embodiments, the first Fn3 domain is in the N-terminal position and binds IGF-IR and the second Fn3 domain binds VEGFR2. In some embodiments, the first Fn3 domain is in the N-terminal position and binds VEGFR2 and the second domain binds IGF-IR. In some embodiments, the first Fn3 domain is in the N- terminal position and binds IGF- I R and the second domain binds VEGFR2.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the multivalent polypeptides comprise first and second Fn3 domains that bind to different targets. In such embodiments, it may be desirable to tune the potency of one Fn3 binding domain relative to the other Fn3 binding domain. For example, if the binding affinity of the first Fn3 domain is significantly higher than the binding affinity of the second Fn3 domain, the biological effect of the first Fn3 domain could overwhelm the effects of the second of second Fn3 domain. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, it may be desirable for the binding affinities of the first and second Fn3 domains of a multivalent polypeptide to be similar to each other, e.g., binding affinities within 100-fold, 30- fold, 10-fold, 3-fold, 1-fold, 0.3-fold or 0 1-fold, of each other, or binding affinities within 0.1 -fold to 10-fold, within 0 3-fold to 10-fold, within 0.1 -fold to 3-fold, within 0.3-fold to 3-fold, within 0.1 -fold to 1 -fold, within 0 3-fold to 1 -fold, within 1 -fold to 10-fold, within 3-fold to 10-fold, within 3-fold to 30-fold, or within 1 -fold to 3-fold of each other.\n\n\nMulti-domain embodiments One aspect of the application provides for multivalent polypeptides further comprising a binding moiety. In some embodiments, the binding moiety binds a human target piotein with a K\nD\n of less than 10\n\"6\nM, 10\n'7\nM, 10\n\"s\nM, 10\n\"9\nM, or 10\n\"y\nM \n\n In some embodiments, the binding moiety binds a tumor associated target or antigen. In some embodiments antigen targeting will help localize the multivalent polypeptide in terms of tissue distribution or increased local concentration affect either in the tissue or desired cell type. In some embodiments, the binding moiety binds a tumor associated target or antigen, such as, for example, carbonic anhydrase IX, A3, antigen specific for A33 antibody, BrE3-antigen, CDl , CDI a, CD3, CD5, CDl 5, CDl 6, CD 19, CD20, CD21 , CD22, CD23, CD25, CD30, CD45, CD74, CD79a, CD80, HLA-DR, NCA 95, NCA90, HCG and its subunits, CEA (CEACAM-5), CEACAM-6, CSAp, EGFR, EGP- I , EGP-2, Ep-CAM, Ba 733, HER2/neu, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), KC4-antigen, KS-I -antigen, KS 1 -4, Le-Y, macrophage inhibition factor (MIF), MAGE, MUCl , MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, PAM-4-antigen, PSA, PSMA, RS5, Sl OO, TAG-72, p53, tenascin, IL-6, IL-8, insulin growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin growth factor-II. (IGF-II), Tn antigen, Thomson-Friedenreich antigens, tumor necrosis antigens, placenta growth factor (P l GF), 17-1 A-antigen, an angiogenesis marker (e.g., ED-B fibronectin), an oncogene marker, an oncogene product, and other tumor-associated antigens. Recent reports on tumor associated antigens include Mizukami et al., (2005, Nature Med. 1 1 :992-97); Hatfield et al., (2005, Curr. Cancer Drug Targets 5:229-48); Vallbohmer et al. (2005, J. Clin. Oncol. 23:3536- 44); and Ren et al. (2005, Ann. Surg. 242:55-63), each incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the binding moiety is selected from an antibody moiety. An antibody moiety refers to immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen. As such, the term antibody moiety encompasses not only whole antibody molecules, but also antibody multimers and antibody fragments as well as variants (including derivatives) of antibodies, antibody multimers and antibody fragments. Examples of antibody moieties include, but are not limited to single chain Fvs (scFvs), Fab fragments, Fab' fragments, F(ab')\n2\n, disulfide linked Fvs (sdFvs), and Fvs. Antibody moieties may be, for example, monoclonal, chimeric, human, or humanized. \n\n In some embodiments, the antibody moiety is selected from (i) a Fab fragment, having VL, CL, VH and CHl domains; (ii) a Fab' fragment, which is a Fab fragment having one or more cysteine residues at the C-terminus of the CHl domain; (iii) a Fd fragment having VH and CHl domains; (iv) a Fd' fragment having VH and CH l domains and one or more cysteine residues at the C-terminus of the CH l domain; (v) a Fv fragment having the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody; (vi) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., Nature 341 , 544-546 ( 1989)) which consists of a VH domain; (vii) isolated CDR regions; (viii) F(ab')\n2\n fragments, a bivalent fragment including two Fab' fragments linked by a disulphide bridge at the hinge region; (ix) single chain antibody molecules (e.g., single chain Fv; scFv) (Bird et al., Science 242:423-426 (1988); and Huston et al., PNAS (USA) 85:5879-5883 (1988)); (x) a \"diabody\" with two antigen binding sites, comprising a heavy chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (see, e.g., EP Patent Publication No. 404,097; WO93/1 1 161 ; and Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993)); and (xi) a \"linear antibody\" comprising a pair of tandem Fd segments (VH-CHl-VH-CHl ) which, together with complementary light chain polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions (Zapata et al. Protein Eng. 8(10):l 057-1062 (1995); and U.S. Patent No. 5,641 ,870). In some embodiments, an antibody moiety is a single domain antibody.\n\n\nExamples include, but are not limited to, heavy chain antibodies, antibodies naturally devoid of light chains, single domain antibodies derived from conventional 4-chain antibodies, engineered antibodies and single domain scaffolds other than those derived from antibodies. Single domain antibodies may be derived from any species including, but not limited to mouse, human, camel, llama, goat, rabbit, bovine.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, a single domain antibody is a naturally occurring single domain antibody such as VHH domains. VHHs are heavy chain variable domains derived from immunoglobulins naturally devoid of light chains such as those derived from Camelidae (including camel, dromedary, llama, vicuna, alpaca and guanaco) as described in WO94/04678. VHH molecules are about 10 times smaller than IgG molecules. Since VHH's are known to bind to \n'\nunusual\n'\n epitopes \n\n such as cavities or grooves, the affinity of such VHH's may be more suitable for therapeutic treatment, PCT Publication No. WO97/49805.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the single domain antibody is a VHH that binds a serum protein as described in U.S. Publication No. 20070178082. The serum protein may be any suitable protein found in the serum of subject, or fragment thereof. In some embodiments, the serum protein is serum albumin, serum immunoglobulins, thyroxine-binding protein, transferrin, or fibrinogen.\n\n\nVarious techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments that may be used to make antibody fragments used in the invention. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24: 107-1 17 (1992); and Brennan et al., Science, 229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. For example, the antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab'-SH fragments can be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form F(ab')\n2\n fragments (Carter et al., Bio/Technology 10: 163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab')2 fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). See WO 93/16185; U.S. Patent No. 5,571 ,894; and U.S. Patent No. 5,587,458. The antibody fragment may also be a \"linear antibody\", e.g., as described in U.S. Patent. No. 5,641 ,870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific. In some embodiments, the binding moiety comprises one or more avimer sequences. Avimers were developed from human extracellular receptor domains by in vitro exon shuffling and phage display. (Silverman et al., 2005, Nat. Biotechnol. 23: 1493-94; Silverman et al., 2006, Nat. Biotechnol. 24:220.) The resulting multidomain proteins may comprise multiple independent binding domains that may exhibit improved affinity (in some cases sub-nanomolar) and specificity compared with single-epitope binding proteins. Additional details concerning methods of construction and use of avimers are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent \n\n Publication Nos. 20040175756, 20050048512, 20050053973, 20050089932 and 20050221384, which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the binding moiety comprises one or more lipocalin related sequences, e.g., anticalins or lipocalin derivatives. Anticalins or lipocalin derivatives are a type of binding proteins that have affinities and specificities for various target molecules, including those described herein. Such proteins are described in US Patent Publication Nos. 20060058510, 20060088908, 20050106660, and PCT Publication No. WO2006/056464.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the binding moiety comprises one or more tetranectin C-type lectin related sequences or trinectins, e.g., . tetranectin C-type lectin or tetranectin C-type lectin derivatives. Tetranectin C-type lectins or tetranectin C-type lectin derivatives are a type of binding proteins that have affinities and specificities for various target molecules including those described herein. Different tetranectin\n\n\nC-type lectin and related proteins are described in PCT Publication Nos. WO2006/053568, WO2005/080418, WO2004/094478, WO2004/039841 ,\n\n\nWO2004/005335, WO2002/048189, WO98/056906, and U.S. Patent Publication\n\n\nNo.20050202043.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the binding moiety comprises one or more natural ankyrin repeat proteins, e.g., DARPins (Molecular Partners). In some embodiments, the binding moiety comprises one or more\n\n\nAffibodiesâ¢. Affibodiesâ¢ are derived from the IgG binding domain of Staphyloccal Protein A. Novel binding properties can be achieved by altering residues located near the binding surface of the Protein A domain.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the binding moiety comprises one or more cysteine knot based protein scaffolds, i.e., microbodies (Selecore/NascaCell).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the binding moiety comprises one or more Trans- bodies \nÎM\n. Trans-bodies \nM\n are based on transferrin scaffolds (BioResis/Pfizer).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the binding moiety comprises binding proteins based on gamma-crystalline or ubiquitin. These so-called Affilinâ¢ (Scil Proteins) molecules are characterized by the de novo design of a binding region in beta sheet structures of the proteins. Affilinâ¢ molecules have been described in U.S.\n\n\nPublication Nq. 20070248536. \n\n Conjugation\n\n\nThe multivalent polypeptide and the binding moiety may be linked via at least one disulfide bond, a peptide bond, a polypeptide, a polymeric sugar, or a PEG moiety.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the multivalent polypeptide and the binding moiety are linked via a polypeptide. In some embodiments, the polypeptide linker is SEQ ID NOS: 17, 18, or 20.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the multivalent polypeptide and the binding moiety are linked via a polypeptide linker having a protease site that is cleavable by a protease in the blood or target tissue. Such embodiments can be used to release two or more therapeutic proteins for better delivery or therapeutic properties or more efficient production compared to separately producing such proteins.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the multivalent polypeptide and the binding moiety are linked via a biocompatible polymer such as a polymeric sugar. Such polymeric sugar can include an enzymatic cleavage site that is cleavable by an enzyme in the blood or target tissue. Such embodiments can be used to release two or more therapeutic proteins for better delivery or therapeutic properties or more efficient production compared to separately producing such proteins. In some embodiments, the multivalent polypeptide and the binding moiety are linked via a polymeric linker. Polymeric linkers can be used to optimally vary the distance between each protein moiety to create a protein with one or more of the following characteristics: 1 ) reduced or increased steric hindrance of binding of one or more protein domain when binding to a protein of interest, 2) increased protein stability or solubility without searching for additional amino acid substitutions to increase stability or solubility (e.g., solubility at least about 20mg/ml, or at least about 50mg/ml), 3) decreased protein aggregation without searching for additional amino acid substitutions to decrease stability (e.g., as measured by SEC), and 4) increased the overall avidity or affinity of the protein by adding additional binding domains.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the multivalent polypeptide comprises a second \n1()\nFn3 domain comprising the linker of SEQ ID NO: 18. PEG is conjugated to the cysteine \n\n moiety in the linker sequence and links the multivalent polypeptide and the binding moiety.\n\n\nPEGylated embodiments One aspect of the application provides linking the multivalent polypeptides to nonproteinaceous polymers. In some embodiments, the polymer is polyethylene glycol (\"PEG\"), polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes, as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301 ,144; 4,670,417; 4,791 ,192 or 4,179,337. In some embodiments, the multivalent polypeptides comprise an Fn3 domain. In some embodiments, the polymer is a PEG moiety. In addition, the application provides N or C terminal PEG conjugation to antibody moieties (e.g., camel antibodies and their derivatives, as well as single chain and domain antibodies; and particularly those expressed from microbes) and antibody-like moieties (e.g., derivatives of lipocalins, ankyrins, multiple Cys-Cys domains, and tetranectins; and particularly those expressed from microbes).\n\n\nPEG is a well-known, water soluble polymer that is commercially available or can be prepared by ring-opening polymerization of ethylene glycol according to methods well known in the art (Sandler and Karo, Polymer Synthesis, Academic Press, New York, Vol. 3, pages 138-161). The term \"PEG\" is used broadly to encompass any polyethylene glycol molecule, without regard to size or to. modification at an end of the PEG, and can be represented by the formula: X-O(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n-\nI\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nOH (1), where n is 20 to 2300 and X is H or a terminal modification, e.g., a Ci\n-4\n alkyl. In one embodiment, the PEG of the invention terminates on one end with hydroxy or methoxy, i.e., X is H or CH\n3\n (\"methoxy PEG\"). A PEG can contain further chemical groups which are necessary for binding reactions; which results from the chemical synthesis of the molecule; or which is a spacer for optimal distance of parts of the molecule. In addition, such a PEG can consist of one or more PEG side-chains which are linked together. PEGs with more than one PEG chain are called multiarmed or branched PEGs. Branched PEGs can be prepared, for example, by the addition of polyethylene oxide to various polyols, including glycerol, pentaerythriol, and sorbitol. For example, a four-armed branched PEG can be prepared from pentaerythriol and ethylene oxide. Branched \n\n PEG are described in, for example, European Published Application No. 473084A and U.S. Patent No. 5,932,462. One form of PEGs includes two PEG side-chains (PEG2) linked via the primary amino groups of a lysine (Monfardini, C, et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 6 (1995) 62-69). PEG conjugation to peptides or proteins generally involves the activation of\n\n\nPEG and coupling of the activated PEG-intermediates directly to target proteins/peptides or to a linker, which is subsequently activated and coupled to target proteins/peptides (see Abuchowski, A. et al, J. Biol. Chem., 252, 3571 (1977) and J. Biol. Chem., 252, 3582 (1977), Zalipsky, et al., and Harris et. al., in: Poly( ethylene glycol) Chemistry: Biotechnical and Biomedical Applications; (J. M. Harris ed.) Plenum Press: New York, 1992; Chap.21 and 22). It is noted that a binding polypeptide containing a PEG molecule is also known as a conjugated protein, whereas the protein lacking an attached PEG molecule can be referred to as unconjugated. The size of PEG utilized will depend on several factors including the intended use of the multivalent polypeptide. Larger PEGs are preferred to increase half life in the body, blood, non-blood extracellular fluids or tissues. For in vivo cellular activity, PEGs of the range of about 10 to 60 kDa are preferred, as well as PEGs less than about 100 kDa and more preferably less than about 60 kDa, though sizes greater than about 100 kDa can be used as well. For in vivo imaging application, smaller PEGs, generally less than about 20 kDa, may be used that do not increase half life as much as larger PEGs so as to permit quicker distribution and less half life. A variety of molecular mass forms of PEG can be selected, e.g., from about 1 ,000 Daltons (Da) to 100,000 Da (n is 20 to 2300), for conjugating to binding polypeptides of the invention. The number of repeating units \"n\" in the PEG is approximated for the molecular mass described in Daltons. It is preferred that the combined molecular mass of PEG on an activated linker is suitable for pharmaceutical use. Thus, in one embodiment, the molecular mass of the PEG molecules does not exceed 100,000 Da. For example, if three PEG molecules are attached to a linker, where each PEG molecule has the same molecular mass of 12,000 Da (each n is about 270), then the total molecular mass of PEG on the linker is about 36,000 Da (total n is about 820). The molecular masses of the PEG \n\n attached to the linker can also be different, e.g., of three molecules on a linker two PEG molecules can be 5,000 Da each (each n is about 1 10) and one PEG molecule can be 12,000 Da (n is about 270). In some embodiments, one PEG moiety is conjugated to the multivalent polypeptide. In some embodiments, the PEG moiety is about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90 KDa. In some embodiments, the PEG moiety is about 40 KDa.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, PEGylated multivalent polypeptides contain one, two or more PEG moieties. In one embodiment, the PEG moiety(ies) are bound to an amino acid residue which is on the surface of the protein and/or away from the surface that contacts the target ligand. In one embodiment, the combined or total molecular mass of PEG in PEG- binding polypeptide is from about 3,000 Da to 60,000 Da, or from about 10,000 Da to 36,000 Da. In a one embodiment, the PEG in pegylated binding polypeptide is a substantially linear, straight-chain PEG.\n\n\nOne skilled in the art can select a suitable molecular mass for PEG, e.g., based on how the pegylated binding polypeptide will be used therapeutically, the desired dosage, circulation time, resistance to proteolysis, immunogenicity, and other considerations. For a discussion of PEG and its use to enhance the properties of proteins, see N. V. Katre, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 10: 91 -1 14 (1993).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, a multivalent polypeptide is covalently linked to one polyethylene glycol) group of the formula: âCOâ (CH\n2\n)\nX\nâ (OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nm\nâ OR, with the â CO (i.e. carbonyl) of the poly( ethylene glycol) group forming an amide bond with one of the amino groups of the binding polypeptide; R being lower alkyl; x being 2 or 3; m being from about 450 to about 950; and n and m being chosen so that the molecular weight of the conjugate minus the binding polypeptide is from about 10 to 40 kDa. In one embodiment, a binding polypeptide's Îµ-amino group of a lysine is the available (free) amino group.\n\n\nIn one specific embodiment, carbonate esters of PEG are used to form the PEG-binding polypeptide conjugates. N,N\n:\n-disuccinimidylcarbonate (DSC) may be used in the reaction with PEG to form active mixed PEG-succinimidyl carbonate that may be subsequently reacted with a nucleophilic group of a linker or an amino group of a binding polypeptide (see U.S. Patent No. 5,281 ,698 and U.S. Patent No. 5,932,462). In a similar type of reaction, 1 , 1 '-(dibenzotriazolyl)carbonate and di-(2- \n\n pyridyl)carbonate may be reacted with PEG to form PEG-benzotriazolyl and PEG- pyridyl mixed carbonate (U.S. Patent No. 5,382,657), respectively.\n\n\nPegylation of a multivalent polypeptide can be performed according to the methods of the state of the art, for example by reaction of the binding polypeptide with electrophilically active PEGs (supplier: Shearwater Corp., USA, www.shearwatercorp.com). Preferred PEG reagents of the present invention are, e.g., N-hydroxysuccinimidyl propionates (PEG-SPA), butanoates (PEG-SBA), PEG- succinimidyl propionate or branched N-hydroxysuccinimides such as mPEG2-NHS (Monfardini, C, et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 6 (1995) 62-69). Such methods may used to pegylated at a Îµ-amino group of a binding polypeptide lysine or the N- terminal amino group of the binding polypeptide.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, PEG molecules may be coupled to sulfhydryl groups on a binding polypeptide (Sartore, L., et al., Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol., 27, 45 (1991); Morpurgo et al., Biocon. Chem., 7, 363-368 (1996); Goodson et al., Bio/Technology (1990) 8, 343; U.S. Patent No. 5,766,897). U.S. Patent Nos. 6,610,281 and 5,766,897 describes exemplary reactive PEG species that may be coupled to sulfhydryl groups.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the pegylated a multivalent polypeptide is produced by site-directed pegylation, particularly by conjugation of PEG to a cysteine moiety at the N- or C-terminus. In some embodiments, the multivalent polypeptide is an Fn3 domain covalently bound to a PEG moiety, wherein at least one of the loops of said Fn3 domain participates in target binding. The PEG moiety may be attached to the Fn3 polypeptide by site directed pegylation, such as by attachment to a Cys residue, where the Cys residue may be positioned at the N-terminus of the Fn3 polypeptide or between the N-terminus and the most N-terminal beta or beta-like strand or at the C-terminus of the Fn3 polypeptide or between the C-terminus and the most C-terminal beta or beta-like strand. A Cys residue may be situated at other positions as well, particularly any of the loops that do not participate in target binding. A PEG moiety may also be attached by other chemistry, including by conjugation to amines.\n\n\nIn some embodiments where PEG molecules are conjugated to cysteine residues on a binding polypeptide, the cysteine residues are native to the binding \n\n polypeptide, whereas in other embodiments, one or more cysteine residues are engineered into the binding polypeptide. Mutations may be introduced into a binding polypeptide coding sequence to generate cysteine residues. This might be achieved, for example, by mutating one or more amino acid residues to cysteine. Preferred amino acids for mutating to a cysteine residue include serine, threonine, alanine and other hydrophilic residues. Preferably, the residue to be mutated to cysteine is a surface-exposed residue. Algorithms are well-known in the art for predicting surface accessibility of residues based on primary sequence or a protein. Alternatively, surface residues may be predicted by comparing the amino acid sequences of binding polypeptides, given that the crystal structure of the framework based on which binding polypeptides are designed and evolved has been solved (see Himanen et al., Nature. (2001 ) 20-27;414(6866):933-8) and thus the surface- exposed residues identified. In one embodiment, cysteine residues are introduced into binding polypeptides at or near the N- and/or C-terminus, or within loop regions. Pegylation of cysteine residues may be carried out using, for example, PEG- maleiminde, PEG-vinylsulfone, PEG-iodoacetamide, or PEG-orthopyridyl disulfide.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the pegylated binding polypeptide comprises a PEG molecule covalently attached to the alpha amino group of the N-terminal amino acid.\n\n\nSite specific N-terminal reductive animation is described in Pepinsky et al., (2001) JPET, 297,1059, and U.S. Patent No. 5,824,784. The use of a PEG-aldehyde for the reductive amination of a protein utilizing other available nucleophilic amino groups is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,002,531 , in Wieder et al., (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254,12579, and in Chamow et al., (1994) Bioconjugate Chem. 5, 133.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, pegylated binding polypeptide comprises one or more PEG molecules covalently attached to a linker, which in turn is attached to the alpha amino group of the amino acid residue at the N-terminus of the binding polypeptide. Such an approach is disclosed in U.S. Publication No. 2002/0044921 and PCT Publication No. WO94/01451.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding polypeptide is pegylated at the C-terminus. In a specific embodiment, a protein is pegylated at the C-terminus by the introduction of C-terminal azido-methionine and the subsequent conjugation of a methyl-PEG- triarylphosphine compound via the Staudinger reaction. This C-terminal \n\n conjugation method is described in Cazalis et al., C-Terminal Site-Specific PEGylation of a Truncated Thrombomodulin Mutant with Retention of Full Bioactivity, Bioconjug Chem. 2004;15(5): 1005-1009.\n\n\nConventional separation and purification techniques known in the art can be used to purify PEGylated binding polypeptide, such as size exclusion (e.g., gel filtration) and ion exchange chromatography. Products may also be separated using SDS-PAGE. Products that may be separated include mono-, di-, tri- poly- and un- pegylated binding polypeptide, as well as free PEG. The percentage of mono-PEG conjugates can be controlled by pooling broader fractions around the elution peak to increase the percentage of mono-PEG in the composition. About ninety percent mono-PEG conjugates represents a good balance of yield and activity. Compositions in which, for example, at least ninety-two percent or at least ninety-six percent of the conjugates are mono-PEG species may be desired. In an embodiment of this invention the percentage of mono-PEG conjugates is from ninety percent to ninety- six percent.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the PEG in a pegylated multivalent polypeptide is not hydrolyzed from the pegylated amino acid residue using a hydroxylamine assay, e.g., 450 mM hydroxylamine (pH 6.5) over 8 to 16 hours at room temperature, and is thus stable. In one embodiment, greater than 80% of the composition is stable mono-PEG-binding polypeptide, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the pegylated polypeptides will preferably retain at least about 25%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 100% of the biological activity associated with the unmodified protein. In one embodiment, biological activity refers to its ability to bind to a target molecule, as assessed by KQ, k\non\n or k\nO\nÎ¹y.\n\n\nIn one specific embodiment, the pegylated binding polypeptide protein shows an increase in binding to a target molecule relative to unpegylated binding polypeptide.\n\n\nThe serum clearance rate of PEG-modified polypeptide may be decreased by about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or even 90%, relative to the clearance rate of the unmodified binding polypeptide. The PEG-modified polypeptide may have a half-life (t|/\n2\n) which is enhanced relative to the half-life of the unmodified protein. The half-life of PEG- binding polypeptide may be enhanced \n\n by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 400% or 500%, or even by 1000% relative to the half- life of the unmodified binding polypeptide. In some embodiments, the protein half- life is determined in vitro, such as in a buffered saline solution or in serum. In other embodiments, the protein half-life is an in vivo half life, such as the half-life of the protein in the serum or other bodily fluid of an animal.\n\n\nDeimmunization of multivalent polypeptides\n\n\nIn one aspect, the application provides deimmunized multivalent polypeptides. In some embodiments, the sequence of a multivalent polypeptide has been altered to eliminate one or more B- or T-cell epitopes.\n\n\nThe multivalent polypeptide may be deimmunized to render it non- immunogenic, or less immunogenic, to a given species. Deimmunization can be achieved through structural alterations to the polypeptide. Any deimmunization technique known to those skilled in the art can be employed. One suitable technique, for example, for deimmunizing proteins is described in WO 00/34317, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. In summary, a typical protocol within the general method described therein includes the following steps: 1. Determining the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide; 2. Identifying potential T-cell epitopes within the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide by any method including determination of the binding of peptides to MHC molecules, determination of the binding of peptide: HLA complexes to the T- cell receptors from the species to receive the therapeutic protein, testing of the polypeptide or parts thereof using transgenic animals with HLA molecules of the species to receive the therapeutic protein, or testing such transgenic animals reconstituted with immune system cells from the species to receive the therapeutic protein; and\n\n\n3. By genetic engineering or other methods for producing modified polypeptide, altering the polypeptide to remove one or more of the potential T-cell epitopes and producing such an altered polypeptide for testing.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the sequences of the polypeptide can be analyzed for the presence of MHC class II binding motifs. For example, a comparison may be made \n\n with databases of MHC-binding motifs such as, for example by searching the \"motifs\" database on the worldwide web at sitewehil.wehi.edu.au. Alternatively, MHC class II binding peptides may be identified using computational threading methods such as those devised by Altuvia et al. (J. MoI. Biol. 249 244-250 (1995)) whereby consecutive overlapping peptides from the polypeptide are testing for their binding energies to MHC class II proteins. Computational binding prediction algorithms include iTopeâ¢, Tepitope, SYFPEITHI, EpiMatrix (EpiVax), and MHCpred. In order to assist the identification of MHC class II-binding peptides, associated sequence features which relate to successfully presented peptides such as amphipathicity and Rothbard motifs, and cleavage sites for cathepsin B and other processing enzymes can be searched for.\n\n\nHaving identified potential (e.g. human) T-cell epitopes, these epitopes are then eliminated by alteration of one or more amino acids, as required to eliminate the T-cell epitope. Usually, this will involve alteration of one or more amino acids within the T-cell epitope itself. This could involve altering an amino acid adjacent the epitope in terms of the primary structure of the protein or one which is not adjacent in the primary structure but is adjacent in the secondary structure of the molecule. The usual alteration contemplated will be amino acid substitution, but it is possible that in certain circumstances amino acid addition or deletion will be appropriate. All alterations can be accomplished by recombinant DNA technology, so that the final molecule may be prepared by expression from a recombinant host, for example by well established methods, but the use of protein chemistry or any other means of molecular alteration may also be used.\n\n\nOnce identified T-cell epitopes are removed, the deimmunized sequence may be analyzed again to ensure that new T-cell epitopes have not been created and, if they have, the epitope(s) can be deleted.\n\n\nNot all T-cell epitopes identified computationally need to be removed. A person skilled in the art will appreciate the significance of the \"strength\" or rather potential immunogenicity of particular epitopes. The various computational methods generate scores for potential epitopes. A person skilled in the art will recognize that only the high scoring epitopes may need to be removed. A skilled person will also recognize that there is a balance between removing potential epitopes and \n\n maintaining binding affinity of the polypeptide. Therefore, one strategy is to sequentially introduce substitutions into the polypeptide and then test for antigen binding and immunogenicity.\n\n\nIn one aspect the deimmunized polypeptide is less immunogenic (or rather, elicits a reduced HAMA response) than the original polypeptide in a human subject. Assays to determine immunogenicity are well within the knowledge of the skilled person. Art-recognized methods of determining immune response can be performed to monitor a HAMA response in a particular subject or during clinical trials. Subjects administered deimmunized polypeptide can be given an immunogenicity assessment at the beginning and throughout the administration of said therapy. The HAMA response is measured, for example, by detecting antibodies to the deimmunized polypeptide , in serum samples from the subject using a method known to one in the art, including surface plasmon resonance technology (BIACORE) and/or solid-phase ELISA analysis. Alternatively, in vitro assays designed to measure a T-cell activation event are also indicative of immunogenicity.\n\n\nAdditional Modifications\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the multivalent polypeptides are glycosylated. Fn3 domains do not normally contain glycosylation sites, however, such glycosylation may be engineered into the protein.\n\n\nGlycosylation of proteins is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X- threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. These can be engineered into the proteins of the invention, in particular fibronectin- based scaffold proteins and their corresponding polynucleotides. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used. \n\n Addition of glycosylation sites to proteins is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above- described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the multivalent polypeptides are modified to enhance antigen-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). In some embodiments, the multivalent polypeptide is an Fn3 domain further comprising an Fc region. In some embodiments, the Fc region is a variant that enhances ADCC or CDC. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgGl , IgG2, lgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (e.g., a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the variant Fc region may mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the presence of human effector cells more effectively, or bind an Fc gamma receptor (FcÎ³R) with better affinity, than a native sequence Fc region. Such Fc region variants may comprise an amino acid modification at any one or more of positions 256, 290, 298, 312, 326, 330, 333, 334, 360, 378 or 430 of the Fc region, wherein the numbering of the residues in the Fc region is that of the EU index as in Kabat.\n\n\nNucleic acid-protein fusion technology\n\n\nIn one aspect, the application provides multivalent polypeptides comprising fibronectin type III domains that bind a human target, such as, for example, EGFR, VEGFR2, IGF-IR, or other proteins. One way to rapidly make and test Fn3 domains with specific binding properties is the nucleic acid-protein fusion technology of Adnexus, a Bristol-Myers Squibb R&D Company. This disclosure describes the use of such in vitro expression and tagging technology, termed PROfusionâ¢, that exploits nucleic acid-protein fusions (RNA- and DNA-protein fusions) to identify novel polypeptides and amino acid motifs that are important for binding to proteins. Nucleic acid-protein fusion technology is a technology that covalently couples a protein to its encoding genetic information. For a detailed description of the RNA- \n\n protein fusion technology and fibronectin-based scaffold protein library screening methods see Szostak et al., U.S. Patent Nos.: 6,258,558; 6,261 ,804; 6,214,553; 6,281 ,344; 6,207,446; 6,518,018; PCT Publication Nos. WO00/34784; WO01/64942; WO02/032925; and Roberts and Szostak, Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. 94:12297-12302, 1997, herein incorporated by reference. Further discussion of nucleic acid-protein fusion technology can be found in the Examples and the Materials and Methods section of the application.\n\n\nVectors & Polynucleotides Embodiments Nucleic acids encoding any of the various proteins or polypeptides disclosed herein may be synthesized chemically. Codon usage may be selected so as to improve expression in a cell. Such codon usage will depend on the cell type selected. Specialized codon usage patterns have been developed for E. coli and other bacteria, as well as mammalian cells, plant cells, yeast cells and insect cells. See for example: Mayfield et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Jan 21 ;100(2):438-42; Sinclair et al. Protein Expr Purif. 2002 Oct;26(l ):96-105; Connell ND. Curr Opin Biotechnol. 2001 Oct;12(5):446-9; Makrides et al. Microbiol Rev. 1996 Sep;60(3):512-38; and Sharp et al. Yeast. 1991 Oct;7(7):657-78.\n\n\nGeneral techniques for nucleic acid manipulation are described for example in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, VoIs. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2 ed., 1989, or F. Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Green Publishing and Wiley-lnterscience: New York, 1987) and periodic updates, herein incorporated by reference. The DNA encoding the polypeptide is operably linked to suitable transcriptional or translational regulatory elements derived from mammalian, viral, or insect genes. Such regulatory elements include a transcriptional promoter, an optional operator sequence to control transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosomal binding sites, and sequences that control the termination of transcription and translation. The ability to replicate in a host, usually conferred by an origin of replication, and a selection gene to facilitate recognition of transformants are additionally incorporated.\n\n\nThe proteins described herein may be produced recombinantly not only directly, but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide, which is \n\n preferably a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process a native signal sequence, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, lpp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the native signal sequence may be substituted by, e.g., the yeast invertase leader, a factor leader (including Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces alpha-factor leaders), or acid phosphatase leader, the C. albicans glucoamylase leader, or the signal described in PCT Publication No. WO90/13646. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available. The DNA for such precursor regions may be ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the protein. Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally, in cloning vectors this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA, and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2 micron plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors (the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter).\n\n\nExpression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for Bacilli. \n\n A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trpl gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 (Stinchcomb et al., Nature, 282:39 (1979)). The trpl gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example, ATCC No 44076 or PEP4-1. Jones, Genetics, 85:12 (1977). The presence of the trpl lesion in the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan. Similarly, Leu2-deficient yeast strains (ATCC 20,622 or 38,626) are complemented by known plasmids bearing the Leu2 gene.\n\n\nExpression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the protein of the invention, e.g , a fibronectin-based scaffold protein Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the phoA promoter, beta-lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system, and hybrid piomoters such as the tac promoter. However, other known bacterial promoters are suitable Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S. D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding the protein of the invention\n\n\nPromoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-nch region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcÏption is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcÏption of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3' end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3' end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors. Examples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3- phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, tÏosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase\n\n\nOther yeast promoters, which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcÏption controlled by growth conditions, arc the promoter regions \n\n for alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, metallothionein, glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP Patent Publication No. 73,657. Yeast enhancers also are advantageously used with yeast promoters.\n\n\nTranscription from vectors in mammalian host cells can be controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and most preferably Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.\n\n\nThe early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,419,446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,601 ,978. See also Reyes et al., Nature 297:598-601 (1982) on expression of human .beta. -interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively, the rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.\n\n\nTranscription of a DNA encoding proteins of the invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, .alpha. -fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv, Nature 297:17-18 ( 1982) on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into \n\n the vector at a position 5' or 3' to the multivalent antibody-encoding sequence, but is preferably located at a site 5' from the promoter.\n\n\nExpression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (e.g., yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5' and, occasionally 3', untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding the multivalent antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94/1 1026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.\n\n\nThe recombinant DNA can also include any type of protein tag sequence that may be useful for purifying the protein. Examples of protein tags include but are not limited to a histidine tag, a FLAG tag, a myc tag, an HA tag, or a GST tag. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mammalian cellular hosts can be found in Cloning Vectors: A Laboratory Manual, (Elsevier, New York, 1985), the relevant disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nThe expression construct is introduced into the host cell using a method appropriate to the host cell, as will be apparent to one of skill in the art. A variety of methods for introducing nucleic acids into host cells are known in the art, including, but not limited to, electroporation; transfection employing calcium chloride, rubidium chloride, calcium phosphate, DEAE-dextran, or other substances; microprojectile bombardment; lipofection; and infection (where the vector is an infectious agent).\n\n\nSuitable host cells include prokaryotes, yeast, mammalian cells, or bacterial cells. Suitable bacteria include gram negative or gram positive organisms, for example, E. coli or Bacillus spp. Yeast, preferably from the Saccharomyces species, such as S. cerevisiae, may also be used for production of polypeptides. Various mammalian or insect cell culture systems can also be employed to express recombinant proteins. Baculovirus systems for production of heterologous proteins in insect cells are reviewed by Luckow and Summers, (Bio/Technology, 6:47, 1988). \n\n Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include endothelial cells, COS-7 monkey kidney cells, CV-I , L cells, C127, 3T3, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), human embryonic kidney cells, HeLa, 293, 293T, and BHK cell lines. Purified polypeptides are prepared by culturing suitable host/vector systems to express the recombinant proteins. For many applications, the small size of many of the polypeptides disclosed herein would make expression in E. coli as the preferred method for expression. The protein is then purified from culture media or cell extracts.\n\n\nSuitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated proteins of the invention are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts such as Spodoptera frugiperda (caterpillar), Aedes aegypti (mosquito), Aedes albopictus (mosquito), Drosophila melanogaster (fruitfly), and Bombyx mori have been identified. A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available, e.g., the L-I variant of Autographa californica NPV and the Bm-5 strain of Bombyx mori NPV, and such viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention, particularly for transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells.\n\n\nIn some instance it will be desired to produce proteins in vertebrate cells, such as for glycosylation, and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CVl line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651 ); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., J. Gen Virol. 36:59. ( 1977)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cellsÎDHFR (CHO, Urlaub et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216 (1980)); mouse Sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, Biol. Reprod. 23:243-251 ( 1980)); monkey kidney cells (CVl ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (Wl 38, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51 ); TRI cells (Mather et al., Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci. \n\n 383:44-68 (1982)); MRC 5 cells; FS4 cells; a human hepatoma line (Hep G2); and myeloma or lymphoma cells (e.g., YO, J558L, P3 and NSO cells) (see U.S. Patent No. 5,807,715). Plant cell cultures of cotton, corn, potato, soybean, petunia, tomato, and tobacco can also be utilized as hosts.\n\n\nProtein Production\n\n\nHost cells are transformed with the herein-described expression or cloning vectors for protein production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences. In the examples shown here, the host cells used for high-throughput protein production (HTPP) and mid-scale production was the HMS174-bacterial strain.\n\n\nThe host cells used to produce the proteins of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's Fl O (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma)), RPMl- 1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), (Sigma)) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in Ham et al., Meth. Enz. 58:44 (1979), Barnes et al., Anal. Biochem.l 02:255 (1980), U.S. Patent Nos. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762; 4,560,655; or 5,122,469; WO90/03430; WO87/00195; or U.S. Patent No. Re. 30,985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCINâ¢ drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan. \n\n Proteins disclosed herein can also be produced using cell- translation systems. For such purposes the nucleic acids encoding the polypeptide must be modified to allow in vitro transcription to produce mRNA and to allow cell-free translation of the mRNA in the particular cell-free system being utilized (eukaryotic such as a mammalian or yeast cell-free translation system or prokaryotic such as a bacterial cell-free translation system.\n\n\nProteins of the invention can also be produced by chemical synthesis (e.g., by the methods described in Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 2nd ed., 1984, The Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL). Modifications to the protein can also be produced by chemical synthesis.\n\n\nThe proteins of the present invention can be purified by isolation/purification methods for proteins generally known in the field of protein chemistry. Non- limiting examples include extraction, recrystallization, salting out (e.g., with ammonium sulfate or sodium sulfate), centrifugation, dialysis, ultrafiltration, adsorption chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, normal phase chromatography, reversed-phase chromatography, gel filtration, gel permeation chromatography, affinity chromatography, electrophoresis, countercurrent distribution or any combinations of these. After purification, polypeptides may be exchanged into different buffers and/or concentrated by any of a variety of methods known to the art, including, but not limited to, filtration and dialysis.\n\n\nThe purified polypeptide is preferably at least 85% pure, more preferably at least 95% pure, and most preferably at least 98% pure. Regardless of the exact numerical value of the purity, the polypeptide is sufficiently pure for use as a pharmaceutical product.\n\n\nImaging, Diagnostic and Other Applications\n\n\nIn one aspect, the application provides multivalent polypeptides labeled with a detectable moiety. The polypeptides may be used for a variety of diagnostic applications. The detectable moiety can be any one which is capable of producing, either directly or indirectly, a detectable signal. For example, the detectable moiety may be a radioisotope, such as H3, Cl 4 or 13, P32, S35, or 1131 ; a fluorescent or \n\n chemiluminescent compound, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, or luciferin; or an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase or horseradish peroxidase.\n\n\nAny method known in the art for conjugating a protein to the detectable moiety may be employed, including those methods described by Hunter, et al., Nature 144:945 (1962); David, et al., Biochemistry 13:1014 (1974); Pain, et al., J. Immunol. Meth. 40:219 (1981 ); and Nygren, J. Histochem. and Cytochem. 30:407 (1982). In vitro methods, include conjugation chemistry well know in the art including chemistry compatible with proteins, such as chemistry for specific amino acids, such as Cys and Lys. In order to link a moiety (such as PEG) to a protein of the invention, a linking group or reactive group is used. Suitable linking groups are well known in the art and include disulfide groups, thioether groups, acid labile groups, photolabile groups, peptidase labile groups and esterase labile groups. Preferred linking groups are disulfide groups and thioether groups depending on the application. For polypeptides without a Cys amino acid, a Cys can be engineered in a location to allow for activity of the protein to exist while creating a location for conjugation.\n\n\nMultivalent binding polypeptides linked with a detectable moiety also are useful for in vivo imaging. The polypeptide may be linked to a radio-opaque agent or radioisotope, administered to a subject, preferably into the bloodstream, and the presence and location of the labeled protein in the subject is assayed. This imaging technique is useful in the staging and treatment of malignancies. The protein may be labeled with any moiety that is detectable in a subject, whether by nuclear magnetic resonance, radiology, or other detection means known in the art. Multivalent polypeptides also are useful as affinity purification agents. In this process, the polypeptides are immobilized on a suitable support, such a Sephadex resin or filter paper, using methods well known in the art.\n\n\nMultivalent polypeptides can be employed in any known assay method, such as competitive binding assays, direct and indirect sandwich assays, and immunoprecipitation assays (Zola, Monoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques, pp. 147-158 (CRC Press, Inc., 1987)). \n\n In certain aspects, the disclosure provides methods for detecting a target molecule in a sample A method may comprise contacting the sample with a multivalent polypeptide descÏbed herein, wherein said contacting is carried out under conditions that allow polypeptide-target complex formation, and detecting said complex, thereby detecting said target in said sample Detection may be carried out using any technique known in the art, such as, for example, radiography, immunological assay, fluorescence detection, mass spectroscopy, or surface plasmon resonance The sample will often by a biological sample, such as a biopsy, and particularly a biopsy of a tumor, a suspected tumor The sample may be from a human or other mammal The multivalent polypeptide may be labeled with a labeling moiety, such as a radioactive moiety, a fluorescent moiety, a chromogenic moiety, a chemi luminescent moiety, or a hapten moiety The multivalent polypeptide may be immobilized on a solid support\n\n\nTherapeutic/in vivo uses\n\n\nIn one aspect, the application provides multivalent polypeptides useful in the treatment of disoideis The application also provides methods for administering multivalent polypeptides to a subject In some embodiments, the subject is a human In some embodiments, the multivalent polypeptides are pharmaceutically acceptable to a mammal, in particular a human A \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" polypeptide refers to a polypeptide that is administered to an animal without significant adveise medical consequences Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable multivalent polypeptides include \nl 0\nFn3 domains that lack the lntegÏn-binding domain (RGD) and \nl0\nFn3 domains that are essentially endotoxin free or have very low endotoxin levels\n\n\nThe multivalent polypeptides are particularly useful in disordeis such as cancer In an exemplary embodiment, the multivalent polypeptide comprises Fn3 domains that bind to two different targets The two targets may be within the same signaling pathway or within two separate signaling pathways One of the target molecules may \"recruit\" the multivalent polypeptide to a particular site, such as a cancer cell, while binding to the second target molecule may affect a particular signaling pathway \n\n One aspect of the applications provides multivalent polypeptides that target one or more proteins involved in tumor biology, such as, for example, VEGFR2, IGF-IR, and EGFR. In some embodiments, administration of a multivalent polypeptide inhibits tumor cell growth in vivo. The tumor cell may be derived from any cell type including, without limitation, epidermal, epithelial, endothelial, leukemia, sarcoma, multiple myeloma, or mesodermal cells. Examples of common tumor cell lines for use in xenograft tumor studies include A549 (non-small cell lung carcinoma) cells, DU- 145 (prostate) cells, MCF-7 (breast) cells, Colo 205 (colon) cells, 3T3/]GF-IR (mouse fibroblast) cells, NCI H441 cells, HEP G2 (hepatoma) cells, MDA MB 231 (breast) cells, HT-29 (colon) cells, MDA-MB-435s (breast) cells, U266 cells, SH-SY5Y cells, Sk-Mel-2 cells, NCI-H929, RPM 18226, and A431 cells. In some embodiments, the polypeptide inhibits tumor cell growth relative to the growth of the tumor in an untreated animal. In some embodiments, the polypeptide inhibits tumor cell growth by 50, 60, 70, 80% or more relative to the growth of the tumor in an untreated animal. In some embodiments, the inhibition of tumor cell growth is measured at least 7 days or at least 14 days after the animals have started treatment with the polypeptide. In some embodiments, another antineoplastic agent is administered to the animal with the polypeptide.\n\n\nIn certain aspects, the disclosure provides methods for administering multivalent polypeptides for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of tumours and/or tumour metastases, where the tumour is particularly preferably selected from the group consisting of brain tumour, tumour of the urogenital tract, tumour of the lymphatic system, stomach tumour, laryngeal tumour, monocytic leukemia, lung adenocarcinoma, small-cell lung carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma and breast carcinoma, without being restricted thereto.\n\n\nIn certain aspects, the disclosure provides methods for administering multivalent polypeptide for the treatment of diseases selected from the group of cancerous diseases consisting of squamous cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, kidney cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, head cancer, neck cancer, oesophageal cancer, gynecological cancer, thyroid cancer, lymphoma, chronic leukemia and acute leukemia. \n\n Additional Agents That May be Used with Appropriate Embodiments of the Invention\n\n\nOne aspect of the invention provides multivalent polypeptides linked to a cytotoxic agent. Such embodiments can be prepared by in vitro or in vivo methods as appropriate. In vitro methods, include conjugation chemistry well know in the art including chemistry compatible with proteins, such as chemistry for specific amino acids, such as Cys and Lys. In order to link a cytotoxic agent to a polypeptide, a linking group or reactive group is used. Suitable linking groups are well known in the art and include disulfide groups, thioether groups, acid labile groups, photolabile groups, peptidase labile groups and esterase labile groups. Preferred linking groups are disulfide groups and thioether groups. For example, conjugates can be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond between the antibody and the cytotoxic agent. Preferred cytotoxic agents are maytansinoids, taxanes and analogs of CC- 1065. In some embodiments, a multivalent polypeptide is linked to a bacterial toxin, a plant toxin, ricin, abrin, a ribonuclease (RNase), DNase 1, a protease, Staphylococcal enterotoxin-A, pokeweed antiviral protein, gelonin, diphtherin toxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin, Pseudomonas endotoxin, Ranpimase (Rap), Rap (N69Q), an enzyme, or a fluorescent protein. In some embodiments, a multivalent polypeptide is linked to maytansinoids or maytansinoid analogs. Examples of suitable maytansinoids include maytansinol and maytansinol analogs. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,424,219; 4,256,746; 4,294,757; 4,307,016; 4,313,946; 4,315,929; 4,331,598; 4,361 ,650; 4,362,663; 4,364,866; 4,450,254; 4,322,348; 4,371 ,533; 6,333,410; 5,475,092; 5,585,499; and 5,846,545.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, a multivalent polypeptide is linked to a taxanes. Taxanes suitable for use in the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,372,738 and 6,340,701.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, a multivalent is linked to CC- 1065 or its analogs.. CC-1065 and its analogs are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,372,738; 6,340,701 ; 5,846,545 and 5,585,499. \n\n An attractive candidate for the preparation of such cytotoxic conjugates is\n\n\nCC- 1065, which is a potent anti-tumor antibiotic isolated from the culture broth of\n\n\nStreptomyces zelensis. CC- 1065 is about 1000-fold more potent in vitro than are commonly used anti-cancer drugs, such as doxorubicin, methotrexate and vincristine (B. K. Bhuyan et al., Cancer Res., 42, 3532-3537 ( 1982)).\n\n\nCytotoxic drugs such as methotrexate, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, vincristine, vinblastine, melphalan, mitomycin C, chlorambucil, and calicheamicin are also suitable for the preparation of conjugates of the present invention, and the drug molecules can also be linked to multivalent polypeptides through an intermediary carrier molecule such as serum albumin.\n\n\nIn other therapeutic treatments or compositions, multivalent polypeptides are co-administered, or administered sequentially, with one or more additional therapeutic agents. Suitable therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, targeted therapeutics, other targeted biologies, and cytotoxic or cytostatic agents. In some instances in will be preferred to administer agents from the same or separate therapeutically acceptable vial, syringe or other administration device that holds a liquid formulation.\n\n\nCancer therapeutic agents are those agents that seek to kill or limit the growth of cancer cells while having minimal effects on the patient. Thus, such agents may exploit any difference in cancer cell properties (e.g., metabolism, vascularization or cell-surface antigen presentation) from healthy host cells. Differences in tumor morphology are potential sites for intervention: for example, the second therapeutic can be an antibody such as an anti-VEGF antibody that is useful in retarding the vascularization of the interior of a solid tumor, thereby slowing its growth rate. Other therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, adjuncts such as granisetron HCl, androgen inhibitors such as leuprolide acetate, antibiotics such as doxorubicin, antiestrogens such as tamoxifen, antimetabolites such as interferon alpha-2a, cytotoxic agents such as taxol, enzyme inhibitors such as ras farnesyl -transferase inhibitor, immunomodulators such as aldesleukin, and nitrogen mustard derivatives such as melphalan HCl, and the like.\n\n\nThe therapeutic agents that can be combined with multivalent polypeptides for improved anti-cancer efficacy include diverse agents used in oncology practice \n\n (Reference: Cancer, Principles & Practice of Oncology, DeVita, V. T., Hellman, S., Rosenberg, S. A., 6th edition, Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, 2001 ), such as docetaxel, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab, capecitabine, tamoxifen, toremifene, letrozole, anastrozole, fulvestrant, exemestane, goserelin, oxaliplatin, carboplatin, cisplatin, dexamethasone, antide, bevacizumab, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, levamisole, irinotecan, etoposide, topotecan, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, estramustine, mitoxantrone, abarelix, zoledronate, streptozocin, rituximab, idarubicin, busulfan, chlorambucil, fludarabine, imatinib, cytarabine, ibritumomab, tositumomab, interferon alpha-2b, melphalam, bortezomib, altretamine, asparaginase, gefÏtinib, erlonitib, anti-EGF receptor antibody (e.g., cetuximab or panitumab), ixabepilone, epothilones or derivatives thereof, and conjugates of cytotoxic drugs and antibodies against cell-surface receptors. Preferred therapeutic agents are platinum agents (such as carboplatin, oxaliplatin, cisplatin), taxanes (such as paclitaxel, docetaxel), gemcitabine, and camptothecin. The one or more additional therapeutic agents can be administered before, concurrently, or after the multivalent polypeptides. The skilled artisan will understand that for each therapeutic agent there may be advantages to a particular order of administration. Similarly, the skilled artisan will understand that for each therapeutic agent, the length of time between which the agent, and an antibody, antibody fragment or conjugate of the invention is administered, will vary.\n\n\nFormulation and Administration\n\n\nThe application further provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions comprising the multivalent polypeptides described herein, wherein the composition is essentially endotoxin free. Therapeutic formulations comprising multivalent polypeptides are prepared for storage by mixing the described proteins having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable earners, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. ( 1980)), in the form of aqueous solutions, lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; \n\n preservatives (such as octadecyidimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrans; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEENâ¢, PLURONICSâ¢ or polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\nThe formulations herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Examples of combinations of active compounds are provided in herein. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.\n\n\nThe active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsule and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsule, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).\n\n\nThe formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.\n\n\nSustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the proteins of the invention, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsule. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-mcthacrylate), or \n\n poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Patent No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L- glutamic acid and y ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOTâ¢ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated proteins of the invention may remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37Â°C, resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S-S bond formation through thio-disulfÏde interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.\n\n\nWhile the skilled artisan will understand that the dosage of each therapeutic agent will be dependent on the identity of the agent, the preferred dosages can range from about 10 mg/square meter to about 2000 mg/square meter, more preferably from about 50 mg/square meter to about 1000 mg/square meter.\n\n\nFor therapeutic applications, the multivalent polypeptides are administered to a subject, in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form. They can be administered intravenously as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by intramuscular, subcutaneous, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrathecal, oral, topical, or inhalation routes. The protein may also be administered by intratumoral, peritumoral, intralesional, or perilesional routes, to exert local as well as systemic therapeutic effects. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, and excipients are well known and can be determined by those of skill in the art as the clinical situation warrants. Examples of suitable carriers, diluents and/or excipients include: (1 ) Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline, pH about 7.4, containing about 1 mg/ml to 25 mg/ml human serum albumin, (2) 0.9% saline (0.9% w/v NaCl), and (3) \n\n 5% (w/v) dextrose. The method of the present invention can be practiced in vitro, in vivo, or ex vivo.\n\n\nAdministration of multivalent polypeptides, and one or more additional therapeutic agents, whether co-administered or administered sequentially, may occur as described above for therapeutic applications. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, and excipients for co-administration will be understood by the skilled artisan to depend on the identity of the particular therapeutic agent being co-administered.\n\n\nWhen present in an aqueous dosage form, rather than being lyophilized, the protein typically will be formulated at a concentration of about 0.1 mg/ml to 100 mg/ml, although wide variation outside of these ranges is permitted. For the treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of multivalent polypeptides will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibodies are administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, the course of previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician.

limit the present invention. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one of skill in the art that various changes and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.\n\n\nExample 1. Multivalent Fibronectin Scaffold Domain Proteins, including several V/I \nl0\nFn3-based binders. Various constructs of multivalent fibronectin scaffold domain proteins were generated. The following table depicts constructs described herein and their SEQ ID NOS. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n385A08 is an exemplary IGF-IR binder. V2B is an exemplary VEGFR2 binder. The two domains are linked by either glycine-serine based linkers (e.g., GS5, SEQ ID NO: 21 , and GSlO, SEQ ID NO: 22) or a modified stretch of amino acids that connect the first and second human Fn3 domains (SEQ ID NO: 20). These V/I l\n0\nFn3-based binders can be oriented in different ways - for instance, the V2B domain at the N-terminus, or the IGF-IR domain at the N-terminus. Peg-V2Bshort is a construct lacking the first eight amino acids of the fibronectin based scaffold domain of V2B and is pegylated at its single cysteine residue. AT577 is an IGF-IR binder with a C-terminal tail of SEQ ID NO: 17. AT580 is an IGF-IR binder with a C-terminal tail of SEQ ID NO: 18. Specifically, AT580 is represented by SEQ ID NO: 27. AT580-Peg20-AT580 are two IGF-IR binders connected via their single cysteine residues with a PEG linkage. AT580-PEG40 is an IGF-IR binder (SEQ ID NO: 27) that has a 4OkD peg attached. The multivalent constructs used in the following experiments generally contain a C-terminal His6 tag (SEQ ID NO: 59).\n\n\nExample 2: Expression of V/I \n10\nFn3-based Binders.\n\n\nCertain V/I \nl0\nFn3-based binders were purified using a high throughput protein production process (HTPP) as described in the materials and methods section below. Figure 1 depicts an exemplary SDS-PAGE analysis from several of the V/I l\n0\nFn3-based binders, including those linked by an Fn linker, GS5 linker (SEQ ID NO: 21 ), and GSl O linker (SEQ ID NO: 22). Figure 1 demonstrates acceptable expression levels for the multiple constructs that were tested. Additionally, select clones were also purified using a mid-scale purification process, which encompassed the purification of insoluble binders. An alternative method can also be used, which encompasses purification of soluble binders. These mid-scale purification processes are described in the materials and methods section below. Some specific clones were also purified using a large scale purification process, which is described in the materials and methods section below. \n\n Example 3: Biophysical Characterization of V/I \nl0\nFn3-based Binders.\n\n\nStandard size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on certain HTPP, midscale and large scale purified V/I \nl 0\nFn3-based binders. Mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses were also performed on certain of these constructs that were purified from midscale and large scale processes. Each of these analytical methods are described in the materials and methods section below.\n\n\nSEC results of the HTPP purified constructs varied depending on the orientation of the 385A08 (IGF-IR domain) or V2B (VEGFR-2 domain) subunits within the tandem. With the 385A08 subunit on the N-terminal side (i.e., 385A08- Fn-V2B with a his-tag), SEC showed predominantly monomeric protein (eluted in the 23kDa range vs. globular molecular weight standards), as shown in Figure 2. On the other hand, when the V2B subunit is on the N-terminal side (i.e., V2B-Fn- 385A08 with a his-tag, SEQ ID NO: 8), this resulted in a mixture of monomer (23kDa) and dimer (46kDa vs. globular molecular weight standards), as shown in Figure 3. SEC analysis of constructs where a GS5 (SEQ ID NO: 21) or GSl O linker (SEQ ID NO: 22) was used instead of an Fn linker showed similar results, depending on the orientation of the 385AO8 and V2B subunits. SECs of midscale purified constructs 385A08-Fn-V2B (SEQ ID NO: 8) and\n\n\n385A08-Fn-V2B-cys (SEQ ID NO: 9) were also evaluated. For the midscale purified construct 385A08-Fn-V2B (which has a his-tag, and includes a naturally occurring serine at the C -terminus), the SEC profile was predominantly monomeric with elution in the approximate range of 23kDa based on globular molecular weight standards. However, for the cysteine version of this construct (385A08-Fn-V2B-cys with a his-tag), the SEC demonstrated a mixture of monomeric and dimeric protein. It should be noted that the cysteine version is typically created for pegylation purposes. Equivalent results were observed for solubly expressed and purified 385A08-Fn-VB2 (with his tag) and material that was expressed in an insoluble form and refolded.\n\n\nSelect midscale constructs were further analyzed by LC-MS. The molecular weight measured by LC-MS for 385A08-Fn-V2B (with his tag) is 23,260 Daltons, \n\n which matches the molecular weight of the \"desMet form\" (a version of the tandem where the first methionine is cleaved off) calculated from amino acid composition of the tandem. The molecular weight measured by LC-MS for 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys (with a his-tag) is 23,581 Daltons, which is +174 Daltons of the theoretical calculated molecular weight based on the amino acid composition of the tandem indicating a post translational modification most likely of the Cys residue. In addition, the LC-MS for 385A08-GS 10 (SEQ ID NO: 22)-V2B (with his-tag, SEQ ID NO: 1 1) is 24,040, matching the theoretical molecular weight for this construct. See Figure 4. In addition, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis was performed on two of the midscale purified constructs. The experimentally determined T\n111\n of 385A08-Fn-V2B (with his tag) in 5OmM NaOAc, 15OmM NaCl, pH 4.5 is equal to 51.49Â°C. The DSC of 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys (with his tag) in 5OmM NaOAc, 15OmM NaCl, pH 4.5 showed two transition states of 46.77Â°C & 55.52\n0\nC which is probably due to the presence of dimer due to disulfide bond formation between two tandems (See Figure 4).\n\n\nSEC was also performed on large-scale purified, pegylated 385A08-Fn-V2B- cys (no his tag, SEQ ID NO: 9). SEC of this construct demonstrated material that was 95.1% monomelic as shown in Figure 5. In addition, DSC analysis on this same construct demonstrated that it was half unfolded at a temperature of 56Â°C (see Figure 6) with no unfolding detected at up to 45Â°C.\n\n\nExample 4: Effects of Pegylation on Multivalent Fibronectin Based Proteins.\n\n\nThe fibronectin based scaffold proteins can be pegylated according to the method described below. Various types of PEG, such as linear or branched PEGs, and various sized PEGs can be used. In particular, midscale and large scale purified versions of the construct 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys (SEQ ID NO: 9) were pegylated with\n\n\n4OkD linear and 4OkD branched PEG.\n\n\nAn analysis of drug concentration over a 120 hour period in mice revealed that his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys with branched PEG demonstrated a half life of\n\n\n14.6 hours, while the linear pegylated version of this construct (with his tag) demonstrated a half life of 10.5 hours (Figure 7). Details of the dosing schedule and \n\n half life calculations are described in the materials and methods section below. All concentrations of Adnectin reported here and in the rest of the document are based on the protein and not the PEG portion of the compound.\n\n\nExample 5. Determination of Binding Affinity using Surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore) analysis on Multivalent Fibronectin Based Proteins.\n\n\nSelected HTPP purified fibronectin based scaffold proteins, including several V/I \nl0\nFn3-based binders, were evaluated for their kinetic behavior towards IGF-IR using surface plasmon resonance as described in the materials and methods section below. The dissociation constant, K\nD\n, for these clones is shown in the first column of Figure 8.\n\n\nA concentration series of the midscale purification of the tandem construct 385A08-Fn-V2B (non pegylated, his-tagged version, SEQ ID NO: 8) was also evaluated. The functionality of each of the domains of this construct, specifically, the V2B domain, and the IGF-IR domain, was evaluated as described in the materials and methods section below. With respect to the V2B domain, the K\nD\n of 385A08-Fn-V2B for VEGFR2-Fc was ~ 0.3 nM with an average on rate of 1.4 x 10\n6\n M\n\"1\n sec\n\"1\n, the average off rate was 4.5 x 10\n\"4\n sec\n\" 1\n. With respect to the IGF-IR domain, the K\n0\n of 385A08-Fn-V2B for IGF-IR-Fc was ~ 20 pM with an on rate of 1.1 x 10\n7\n M\n\"1\n sec\n\"\n' and an off rate of 1.7 x 10\n\"4\n sec\n\"1\n (n of 1 ).\n\n\nData was also collected for midscale purified material of the tandem 385A08-GS10 (SEQ ID NO: 22)-V2B (SEQ ID NO: 1 1 ) and V2B-GS10 (SEQ ID NO: 22)-385A08 (SEQ ID NO: 15). Both constructs included a his-tag. The K\nD\n for the IGF-IR domain was 4OpM and 5OpM, respectively. The K\n0\n for the V2B domain was 0.5 nM and 0.6 nM, respectively. Additional data was collected for a linear pegylated, his-tagged midscale purified version of construct 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys (SEQ ID NO: 9). The K\nD\n for the IGF-IR domain was 1.2 nM. The K\nD\n for the V2B domain was 14 nM. These data are shown in Figure 9.\n\n\nAffinity data was also measured from midscale and large scale material, for the pegylated version of the tandem construct 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys (SEQ ID NO: 9, with and without his tag). The specific materials and methods for these calculations are described below. The results show that the various constructs tested bound to \n\n IGFl R-Fc with an average on-rate of 3.15E+05 M\n\"\n's\n\"\n' +/- 0.94E+05 M\n\"\n's\n'\n', and an average off-rate of 2.47E-04 s\n\"1\n +/-0.18E-04 s\n\" 1\n. For VEGFR2-Fc, the measured average association rate was 1.15E+04 M\n\"\n's\n\"\n' +/-0.62E+04 M\n\"\n's\n\"\n', and the dissociation rate was 1.02E-04 s\n\"1\n +/-0.21 E-04 s\n\" 1\n. These data are shown in Figure 10. The average calculated affinities for VEGFR2 and IGFl R using this experimental format are 10.5 Â± 0.48 nM and 0.84 Â± 0.22 nM, respectively.\n\n\nExample 6: Competitive IGFlR and Competitive VEGFR-2 Blocking Assays.\n\n\nCertain tandem constructs were evaluated for their ability to compete with mono-specific IGF-IR and VEGFR-2 binders in vitro. In particular, a pegylated, his-tagged version of the construct 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys (SEQ ID NO: 9)was shown to disrupt the interaction of a mono-specific IGF-IR \nl 0\nFn3-based binder (AT580-PEG40, SEQ ID NO: 27) with cell surface IGF-IR. Using the cell line R\n+\n, which overexpresses IGF-IR, we have shown that the IC\n50\n for blocking the interaction of a high affinity bivalent \nl0\nFn3-based IGFl R binder (AT58O-PEG2O- AT580, SEQ ID NO: 27) was 900 nM for pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B- cys, whereas it was 600 nM for AT580-PEG40. This suggests that pegylated, his- tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys has IGF-IR affinity similar to that of AT580-PEG40. Figure 1 1 demonstrates this data. Similarly, the pegylated, his-tagged construct 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys was able to block the interaction of a mono-specific \nl 0\nFn3-based VEGFR-2 binder (Peg- V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28) with VEGFR-2 present on 293:KDR cells. Results from the 293:KDR assay demonstrated an IC\n50\n of approximately 140 nM for the pegylated, his-tagged construct 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys, whereas that of Peg-V2Bshort is approximately 20 nM (see Figure 12). The 7-fold difference in activity between Peg-V2Bshort and the pegylated, his-tagged construct 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys is consistent with the fact that the VEGFR-2 binding portion of 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys has approximately a 5-fold lower affinity for VEGFR-2 as compared to Peg- V2Bshort. In particular, in a Ba/F3 assay (described below), the IC\n5O\n for the monomelic, non-pegylated VEGFR2 binder V2Bshort (SEQ ID NO: 28) is approximately 0.1 -3 nM whereas the IC\n50\n for the monomeric, non-pegylated VEGFR2 binder having SEQ ID NO: 44 (e.g., with an N-terminal extension) is \n\n approximately 8-13 nM. Therefore, the version of the VEGFR2 binder included in the tandem construct (e.g., having SEQ ID NO: 44 which includes an N-terminal extension) has an approximately 5-fold lower affinity for VEGFR2 as compared to the monomeric VEGFR2 binder used in this assay (e.g., having SEQ ID NO: 28). Both the R\n+\n and 293:KDR cell based competitive blocking assays are described in detail in the materials and methods section below.\n\n\nExample 7. In Vitro Proliferation Assays.\n\n\nCertain purified constructs, including several V/I \n10\nFn3-based binders, were evaluated in Ba/F3 and Rh41 cell-based assays in order to confirm activity. IC50s are depicted in Figure 8 (columns 2, 3). In addition, certain purified constructs were evaluated in Rh41 and HMVEC-L proliferation assays (also described in the materials and methods section below). These constructs were compared to a monospecific antibody directed to IGFl R (MAB391 ), a mono-specific antibody to VEGF (bevacizumab), another mono-specific \nl 0\nFn3-based IGFlR binder (AT-577, SEQ ID NO: 26), a mono-specific \nl 0\nFn3-based VEGFR-2 binder (Peg-V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28), and a wild type \nl 0\nFn3-based protein that does not bind to a target (SGE). The data demonstrates that neither the orientation of the tandem (e.g., whether the I portion or the V portion is at the N-terminus) or the choice of linker affected the results. This data is summarized in Figure 13. In addition, Ba/F3 and NC1-H929 cell proliferation assays were performed to compare certain his-tag and non-his-tag versions of the pegylated construct 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys (SEQ ID NO: 9). These constructs were compared to MAB391 , mono-specific \nl0\nFn3-based IGF-IR binder AT580-PEG40 (SEQ ID NO: 27), and mono-specific \n10\nFn3-based VEGFR2 binder Peg-V2Bshort (SEQ ID NO: 28). These data are summarized in Figure 14.\n\n\nExample 8. Activation and Signaling Activity of Multivalent Fibronectin Based Proteins in Cell-Based Assays.\n\n\nSelect V/I \nl 0\nFn3-based binders were screened for the ability to directly interfere with ligand-stimulated VEGFR2 and IGF-IR activation and downstream\n\n\nMAP kinase signaling. HEK/293 cells and Porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells were transfected with VEGFR2. Stimulation by VEGF induces phosphorylation of \n\n VEGFR and downstream signaling in both cell types. Stimulation by IGFl induces phosphorylation of IGF-IR and downstream signaling in both cell types, see Figure 15. Further details on the PAE and HEK/293 assays are discussed in the materials and methods section below. Figure 16 depicts the effect of various multivalent proteins on HEK/293 cells. All of the multivalent proteins comprising an IGF-IR binding fibronectin scaffold domain decreased levels of phosphorylated IGF-IR to similar levels as compared to a single IGF-IR binding fibronectin scaffold domain protein (AT577). All of the multivalent proteins comprising a VEGFR2 binding fibronectin scaffold domain decreased levels of phosphorylated VEGFR to similar levels as compared to a single VEGFR2 binding fibronectin scaffold domain protein (Peg-V2Bshort). Cell proliferation was evaluated by [\n3\nH]-thymidine incorporation after exposure to the various constructs.\n\n\nFigure 17 depicts the effect of various multivalent proteins on PAE cells. All of the multivalent proteins comprising an IGF-IR binding fibronectin scaffold domain decreased levels of phosphorylated IGF-IR to similar levels as compared to a single IGF-IR binding fibronectin scaffold domain protein (AT577). All of the multivalent proteins comprising a VEGFR2 binding fibronectin scaffold domain decreased levels of phosphorylated VEGFR to similar levels as compared to a single VEGFR2 binding fibronectin scaffold domain protein (Peg-V2Bshort). Cell proliferation was evaluated by [\n3\nH]-thymidine incorporation after exposure to the various constructs.\n\n\nThese results demonstrate that the exemplary polypeptide linkers are able to link fibronectin scaffold domains in an orientation whereby their binding to ligand, and therefore their ability to inhibit receptor signaling, is retained.\n\n\nAdditional studies were conducted on specific varieties of the tandem construct 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys (SEQ ID NO: 9, with and without PEG; with and without a his-tag) in primary human microvascular endothelial cells from lung (HMVEC-L). Assays measuring the following were conducted in HMVEC-L: cell proliferation, inhibition of ligand-induced VEGFR-2 and 1GF-1 R activity (via Western blot analysis), the mobilization of intracellular calcium (Ca2\n+\n Flux) in endothelial cells, and the ability to inhibit formation of nascent capillary-like \n\n structures known as tubes. An additional study measuring the inhibition of ligand- induced VEGFR-2 and IGF-IR activity via Western blot analysis was also conducted in Rh41 cells. Each of these assays are described in further detail in the materials and methods section below. The results from the cellular proliferation assay showed that specific varieties of the 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys constructs inhibit proliferation in HMVEC-L cells with an IC\n50\n ranging between 90 nM and 167 nM (see Figure 18). In one example, a pegylated, non-his-tag version of this construct inhibited proliferation in HMVEC-L cells with an IC\n50\n of - 167 nM, whereas the mono-specific \nl 0\nFn3-based VEGFR-2 binder (Peg-V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28) had an IC\n50\n of- 47 nM.\n\n\nIn order to assess the ability of the 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys constructs to inhibit IGF-I R and VEGFR-2, Western blot analysis was done to measure the activity of ligand-induced VEGFR-2 and IGF-IR activity in HMVEC-L cells by autophosphorylation in the presence or absence of the test compounds. Appropriate controls included the mono-specific \nl0\nFn3-based VEGFR-2 binder (Peg-V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28), and the mono-specific \nl0\nFn3-based IGF-IR binder (AT580- PEG40, SEQ ID NO: 27). The constructs generally inhibited pVEGFR-2 (pVEGFR-2 is phospho- VEGFR-2; also known as p-Flk-1 ), pIGF-l R, and pAKT activity (see Figure 19). A pegylated, non-his-tag version of the 385A08-Fn-V2B- cys construct demonstrated inhibition of pVEGFR-2 activity in a dose response starting at 10 nM, with near complete inhibition being achieved at 100 nM. This same compound also potently inhibited pIGF-lR activity at between 1 nM and 10 nM as compared to AT580-PEG40 where the IC\n50\n for inhibition was 100 nM.\n\n\nIn order to assess the ability of the specific varieties of the 385A08-Fn-V2B- cys constructs to inhibit IGF- I R in an IGF-I R-driven tumor cell line, Western blot analysis was earned out to measure the activity of ligand-induced IGF-I R activity in Rh41 cells by autophosphorylation in the presence or absence of the test compounds. Inhibition of pIGF- l R activity was generally observed for all of the 385A08-Fn- V2B-cys constructs at the 10OnM dose. Inhibition of pAKT was observed at varying levels for all of the 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys constructs tested. In one example, the pegylated, non his-tag version of the 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys construct demonstrated inhibition of pIGF- l R activity starting at the dose response in the ~1 - \n\n 10 nM range and inhibition was nearly complete at 100 nM. These data are summarized in Figure 20.\n\n\nBecause VEGF stimulates the mobilization of intracellular calcium in endothelial cells (as described in Ku, D. D., et al., Vascular endothelial growth factor induces EDRF -dependent relaxation in coronary arteries. Am J Physiol, 1993.\n\n\n265(2 Pt 2): p. H586-92), the ability to inhibit calcium release (Ca\n2+\n) is another measure of cell-based signaling for a VEGFR-2 inhibitor. In an assay measuring calcium release in HMVEC-L cells, the specific varieties of 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys constructs demonstrated an inhibition of Ca\"\n+\n release with an IC\n50\n of 4 - 10 nM. A similar level of inhibition was demonstrated for a mono-specific \nl 0\nFn3-based\n\n\nVEGFR-2 binder (Peg-V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28). The results of this study are summarized in Figure 21 .\n\n\nExample 9. Tumor xenograft efficacy studies on Multivalent Fibronectin Based Proteins.\n\n\nA pegylated, his-tagged version of the construct 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys was evaluated in multiple tumor studies using an RH-41 human rhabdomyosarcoma model, an A549 human lung model, a GEO colon tumor xenograft model, and an A673 Ewing Sarcoma xenograft tumor model. RH-41 and A673 were selected for in vivo testing with 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys as both models had previously shown sensitivity to IGF-IR inhibition. A549 and GEO, which are not as sensitive to IGFlR inhibition, were selected to compare the potency of VEGFR2 inhibition by the multivalent constructs as compared to the monomeric VEGFR2 inhibitor, PEG- V2B-short (SEQ ID NO: 28 with PEG attached at the single cysteine residue). These models are described in more detail in the materials and methods section below.\n\n\nThe RH-41 tumor xenograft model has been demonstrated to be sensitive to IGF-IR inhibition. Pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys was administered on a 3xwk schedule using a single dose level of 100 mg/kg. As illustrated in Figure 22, segment A, pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys was effective in inducing tumor growth delay when dosed for three weeks using this regimen. When compared to a combination of a mono-specific \nl 0\nFn3-based VEGFR-2 binder (Peg-V2Bshort, \n\n SEQ ID NO: 28) and a mono-specific \nl0\nFn3-based IGF-IR binder (AT580-PEG40, SEQ ID NO: 27) that should yield a comparable stoichiometry of target binding for IGFR-I and VEGFR-2, pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys resulted in similar antitumor activity. Furthermore, the antitumor activity achieved with the multivalent construct was superior to that observed when these agents were dosed individually based on percent tumor growth inhibition (% TGI). No overt toxicity was observed for any of these agents as defined by morbidity, behavioral changes or significant weight loss (e.g., >5%). As summarized in Figure 22, Segment B, all of these agents were effective in yielding >50% TGI, however both the combination of AT580-PEG40, Peg-V2Bshort, as well as pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B- Cys alone, resulted in an increased % TGI when compared to each agent alone.\n\n\nThe 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys (with Peg) construct binds to human IGFlR with a much higher affinity than it binds to mouse IGFl R. In particular, 385A08-Fn-V2B- cys (with Peg) binds to human IGFl R with a Kd of 211 pM, to monkey IGFl R with a Kd of 213 pM, to rat IGFl R with a Kd of 92,000 pM and to mouse IGFl R with a Kd of 86,000 pM. The tumor xenograft models used in this study involve human tumors displaying human IGFl R but also involve mouse endothelial cells expressing mouse IGFl R. Since the binding affinity for 385AO8-Fn-V2B-cys (with Peg) to mouse IGFlR is so much lower than that for human IGFlR, the effects seen in this model may underestimate the effects of 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys (with Peg) on tumor inhibition. In particular, tumor growth inhibition could be more significant if the binding affinity for the IGFl R expressed on the endothelial cells was higher.\n\n\nIn a second study using the RH-41 tumor xenograft model, pegylated, his- tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys was evaluated over several dose levels including 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg. These levels were also compared to the combined equivalent API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) dose level of each of the individually targeted mono-specific binders, e.g., a mono-specific \nl Ï\nFn3-based VEGFR-2 binder (Peg-V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28) and a mono-specific \nl0\nFn3-based IGF-IR binder (AT580-PEG40, SEQ ID NO: 27). The results of this study are illustrated in Figure 23 where, for the purpose of clarity, each dose level of pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys is shown individually in comparison to the corresponding combination dose levels of the individual AT580-PEG40 and \n\n Peg-V2Bshort. The combination of AT580-PEG40 and Peg-V2Bshort compared favorably with pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys, resulting in similar % TGI. Furthermore, all dose levels of pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys resulted in similar antitumor activity (as illustrated in Figure 23, Segment D), ranging from 75 - 83% TGl. As a result, further titration at lower dose levels of pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys will be required in order to generate a definitive antitumor dose response curve and to determine the minimum efficacious dose level in this tumor model.\n\n\nThe antitumor activity of pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys was also evaluated in the A549 tumor model in comparison to a mono-specific \n10\nFn3- based VEGFR-2 binder (Peg-V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28) and a mono-specific \nl0\nFn3-based IGF-IR binder (AT580-PEG40, SEQ ID NO: 27), as well as a combination treatment with these two mono-specific binders (see Figure 24). Given the lack of an antitumor response to AT580-PEG40 at the two dose levels tested (Figure 26, Segments A & C) and based on less than 50 % TGI (Figure 26, Segments B & D), this model appears to be insensitive to inhibition of IGF- IR. Further, the combination of AT580-PEG40 and Peg-V2Bshort, did not result in enhanced antitumor activity when compared to dosing of Peg-V2Bshort alone, which was active at both dose levels tested. The observation that the level of tumor growth inhibition achieved with pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys was comparable to that seen with Peg-V2Bshort dosed alone suggests that the antitumor activity observed in this model appears to reside with the antiVEGFR-2 activity of pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys and Peg-V2Bshort.\n\n\nComparable results were also obtained when these agents were evaluated in the GEO human colon xenograft model, which also appears to be insensitive to inhibition of IGF-I R (Figure 25). In this model, pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn- V2B-Cys was inactive at 100 mg/kg (Figure 27, Segments A and B) and the monospecific \n10\nFn3-based IGF-IR binder (AT580-PEG40, SEQ ID NO: 27) was inactive at both dose levels tested (Figure 25, Segments A, B, C, & D). At the higher dose level of 200 mg/kg, pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys was active and demonstrated antitumor activity based on >50% TGI (Figure 25, Segments C and D). Similar to the observations made using the A549 model, the mono-specific \n\n \nl0\nFn3-based VEGFR-2 binder (Peg-V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28) was active against the GEO model, suggesting that the antitumor activity observed with pegylated, his- tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys in this model may be solely dependent on the anti- VEGFR-2 component and that the GEO model is insensitive to IGF-IR inhibition. The increased antitumor activity observed with Peg-V2Bshort (as compared to pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys) in this model (illustrated in Figure 25, Segments A and B) may potentially be a reflection of the higher binding affinity for VEGFR-2 by the monomeric Peg-V2Bshort as compared to the VEGFR2 binding subunit included in the pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys construct (see Example 6 above).\n\n\nIn the A673 Evving Sarcoma xenograft model, pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys showed antitumor activity that was slightly weaker than mono-specific \n10\nFn3-based VEGFR-2 binder (Peg-V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28) (TGI = 72.4% vs 82%, respectively), as shown in Figure 26. This is likely a consequence of the lower affinity (approximately 4-5 fold lower) of the anti-VEGFR2 domain of pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys as compared to Peg-V2Bshort (see Example 6 above). On the other hand, the antitumor activity in the combo group was comparable to that of Peg-V2Bshort (TGI = 80.2 vs 82%, respectively), suggesting that the A673 Ewing Sarcoma xenograft model is insensitive to IGF-IR inhibition because the IGF-IR inhibition contribution to the overall antitumor activity was rather marginal, as evidenced by the response to the mono-specific \nl0\nFn3-based IGF-IR binder (AT580-PEG40, SEQ ID NO: 27) administration (TGI= 24.7%). Antitumor activities from pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys at l OOmg/kg, as well as Peg-V2Bshort and the combination of Peg-V2Bshort + AT580-PEG40 were significantly different from vehicle. Additionally, there appeared to be a dose response between the two different doses tested for pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys (50 vs 100mg/kg) at the end of study (Day 18, TGI= 56.8% vs 72.4%, respectively), but without reaching statistically significant differences between the two (Figure 26). Pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys dose response was also evaluated in the A673 Ewing Sarcoma model. The antitumor activity of doses between 20mg/kg and 200mg/kg were compared; this dose range was selected to \n\n maximize the likelihood to differentiate minimum vs. maximum efficacious doses. The different doses of pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys did not display a dose-dependent antitumor response. In fact, doses of 20, 60, and 100 mg/kg were not distinguishable from each other (TGl= 58.3, 67.1 , 63.1 , respectively) and 200mg/kg had the maximum inhibitory activity (TGI= 80.5%).\n\n\nExample 10: PK/PD studies on Multivalent Fibronectin Based Proteins.\n\n\nSingle-dose pharmacokinetic study with his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys in mice. Figure 27 summarizes the pharmacokinetic parameters of his-tagged\n\n\n385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys in mice. Following a single IV dose of 5 or 50 mg/kg, his- tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys serum concentrations exhibited a slightly bi- exponential decline. The CLTp of his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys was 0.1 1 -0.12 mL/min/kg. The Vss (0.10-0.12 L/kg) was greater than plasma volume but lower than the volume of extracellular fluid (0.2 L/kg). The MRT and T 1/2 of his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys were 15.2-16.8 and 13.0-21.4 h, respectively.\n\n\nAfter a single IP dose of 5 or 50 mg/kg, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys was rapidly absorbed (Tmax = 1.4-3.0 h), with a serum concentration-time profile parallel to that after IV dosing. The absorption was nearly complete, with an absolute IP bioavailability of 83.1 -105.8%. The average Cmax at 5 and 50 mg/kg was 1.5 and 14.4 Î¼M, respectively.\n\n\nSingle-dose pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study with his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys in nude mice bearing the Rh41 tumor.\n\n\nFollowing IP doses of 20 and 200 mg/kg of his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys to nude mice bearing the Rh41 tumor, the mVEGF-A levels showed dose- and time- dependent increases in plasma (Figure 28). Using an indirect-response PD model, the plasma IC50 of his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys that inhibited the clearance of mVEGF-A from plasma by blocking its binding to VEGFR-2 was estimated to be 13.8 Î¼M at 200 mg/kg. At 20 mg/kg, the dynamic range of mVEGF-A concentrations may be too low to yield meaningful estimates of PD parameters.\n\n\nSingle-dose pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study with 385A08-Fn-V2B- Cys (non-his tagged) in nude mice bearing the A 673 tumor. \n\n Consistent with findings observed in nude mice bearing the Rh41 tumor, the mVEGF-A levels showed dose- and time-dependent increases in plasma following IP doses of 20 and 200 mg/kg of 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys (non-his tagged) to nude mice bearing the A673 tumor Figure 29. Using an indirect-response PD model, the plasma IC50 of 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys (non-his tagged) that inhibited the clearance of mVEGF-A from plasma by blocking its binding to VEGFR-2 was estimated to be 7.0 Î¼M at 200 mg/kg. At 20 mg/kg, the dynamic range of mVEGF-A concentrations may be too low to yield meaningful estimates of PD parameters.\n\n\nSingle-dose pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study with his-tagged 385 A 08-Fn- V2B-Cys in monkeys.\n\n\nFigure 30 summarizes the pharmacokinetic parameters of his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys in the monkey following a single IV dose of 3 or 30 mg/kg. His-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys plasma concentrations exhibited a mono- or bi- exponential decline after the IV dose, with a significant drop in concentrations at the terminal phase. The drop in plasma concentrations of his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B- Cys was presumably due to the formation of neutralizing antibodies that were detected in plasma samples of the study. As a result, the plasma concentrations at the last time point were not included in the non-compartmental analysis.\n\n\nIn monkeys, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys exhibited a slight dose- dependency in pharmacokinetics between 3 and 30 mg/kg. The CLTp at 3 and 30 mg/kg was 0.029 and 0.023 mL/min/kg, respectively. The Vss ranged from 0.056 to 0078 L/kg, greater than plasma volume. The MRT and T 1/2 of his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys at 30 mg/kg were 57.9 and 42.7 h, respectively, slightly longer than those observed at 3 mg/kg (34.5 and 23.2 h, respectively). PK/PD modeling was conducted to understand the relationship between the plasma concentrations of his tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys and the elevation of circulating hVEGF-A levels. To fit the drop of plasma concentrations of his tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys in the terminal phase, an added clearance mechanism due to neutralizing antibodies was included in the PK model. The fitted vs. observed PK profiles are shown in Figure 31. The plasma IC50 of his tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B- Cys that inhibited the clearance of hVEGF-A from plasma by blocking its binding to \n\n VEGFR-2 was estimated to be 77-349 nM in monkeys, with a grand mean of 228 nM.\n\n\nSingle-dose pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study with 385A08-Fn-V2B (non-his tagged) in monkeys. Figure 32 summarizes the pharmacokinetic parameters of 385A08-Fn-V2B\n\n\n(non-his tagged) in the monkey following a 3 mg/kg IV dose as well as re-dosing the same monkeys at the same dose. Similar to his tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys, there was a drop in the plasma concentrations of 385A08-Fn-V2B (non-his tagged) at the terminal phase after the first dose. As a result, the plasma concentrations at the last time point were not included in the non-compartmental analysis. However, when 385A08-Fn-V2B (non-his tagged) was re-dosed to the same monkeys, the effect of antibodies on the pharmacokinetics of 385A08-Fn-V2B (non-his tagged) appeared not to be significant (Figure 32). In addition, the pharmacokinetics 385A08-Fn-V2B (non-his tagged) was comparable to that of his tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys in monkeys.\n\n\nSimilar to what was done to his tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys, PK/PD modeling was also conducted to understand the relationship between the plasma concentrations of 385A08-Fn-V2B (non-his tagged) and the elevation of circulating hVEGF-A levels. The fitted vs. observed PK profiles are shown in Figure 33. The plasma IC50 of 385A08-Fn-V2B (non-his tagged) that inhibited the clearance of hVEGF-A from plasma by blocking its binding to VEGFR-2 was estimated to be 68-231 nM in monkeys, with a grand mean of 159 nM. These results are consistent with those observed with his tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nHigh Throughput Protein Production (HTPP). Selected binders containing a His\n6\n tag (SEQ ID NO: 59) were cloned into the pET9d vector, transformed into E. coli HMS 174 cells, inoculated into 5ml LB medium containing 50 Î¼g/mL kanamycin in a 24-well format and grown at 37 Â°C overnight. Fresh 5ml LB medium (50 Î¼g/mL kanamycin) cultures were prepared for inducible expression by aspirating 200 Î¼l from the overnight culture and dispensing it into the appropriate well. The cultures were grown at 37 \n0\nC until A\n6O\no 0.6-0.9. After induction with 1 \n\n mM isopropyl-Î²-thiogalactoside (IPTG), the culture was expressed for 6 hours at 3O\n0\nC and harvested by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 2,750 x g at 4 \n0\nC. Cell Pellets were frozen at -80\n0\nC.\n\n\nCell pellets (in a 24-well format) were lysed by resuspension in 450Î¼l of Lysis buffer (50 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, I x Completeâ¢ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail-EDTA free (Roche), 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM CHAPS, 40 mM Imidazole, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 30 ug/ml DNAse, 2 ug/ml aprotonin, pH 8.0) and shaken at room temperature for 1 -3 hours. Lysates were clarified and re-racked into a 96-well format by transfer into a 96-well Whatman GF/D UnifÏlter fitted with a 96-well, 1.2 mL catch plate and filtered by positive pressure. The clarified lysates were transferred to a 96-well Ni-Chelating Plate that had been equilibrated with equilibration buffer (50 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 40 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0) and were incubated for 5 min. Unbound material was removed by vacuum. The resin was washed 2 x 0.3 ml/well with Wash buffer #1 (50 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM CHAPS, 40 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0) with each wash removed by vacuum. Next, the resin was washed with 3 x 0.3 ml/well with PBS with each wash step removed by vacuum. Prior to elution, each well was washed with 50 Î¼l Elution buffer (PBS + 20 mM EDTA), incubated for 5 min, and the wash discarded by vacuum. Protein was eluted by applying an additional 100 ul of Elution buffer to each well. After a 30 minute incubation at room temperature, the plate(s) were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 200 g. Eluted protein was collected in 96-well catch plates containing 5 Î¼l of 0.5 M MgCl\n2\n added to the bottom of the elution catch plate prior to elution. Eluted protein was quantified using a BCA assay with SGE as the protein standard. Midscale expression and purification of insoluble fibronectin-based scaffold protein binders. For expression, selected clone(s), followed by the His\n<\n-, tag (SEQ ID NO: 59), were cloned into a pET9d (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) vector and were expressed in E. coli HMS 174(DE3) cells. Twenty ml of an inoculum culture (generated from a single plated colony) was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium containing 50 Î¼g/mL kanamycin. The culture was grown at 37 Â°C until A\n600\n 0.6-1.0. After induction with 1 mM isopropyl-Î²-thiogalactoside (IPTG) the culture was grown for 6 hours at 30\n0\nC and was harvested by centrifugation for 30 minutes at \n\n > 10,000 g at 4 \n0\nC. Cell Pellets were frozen at -80 \n0\nC. The cell pellet was resuspended in 25 mL of lysis buffer (20 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, Ix Completeâ¢ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail-EDTA free (Roche), 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.4) using an Ultra-turrax homogenizer (IKA works) on ice. Cell lysis was achieved by high pressure homogenization (> 18,000 psi) using a Model M-1 1 OS Micro fluidizer (Microfluidics). The insoluble fraction was separated by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 23,300 x g at 4 Â°C. The insoluble pellet recovered from centrifugation of the lysate was washed with 20 mM Sodium Phosphate/500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The pellet was resolubilized in 6.0 M Guanidine Hydrochloride in 20 mM Sodium Phosphate/500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 with sonication followed by incubation at 37 degrees for 1 -2 hours. The resolubilized pellet was filtered to 0.45 urn and loaded onto a HisTrap column equilibrated with the 20 mM Sodium Phosphate/500 mM NaCl/6.0 M Guanidine, pH 7.4 buffer. After loading, the column was washed to baseline UV A280 absorbance with 20 column volumes (CV) of equilibration buffer, followed by washing for an additional 25 CV with the same buffer. Bound protein was eluted with 500 mM Imidazole in 20 mM Sodium Phosphate/500 mM NaCl/6.0 M Guan-HCl, pH 7.4. The purified protein was refolded by dialysis against 50 mM Sodium Acetate/150 mM NaCl pH 4.5.\n\n\nMidscale expression and purification of soluble fibronectin-based scaffold protein binders. As an alternative to purification of insoluble binders, the purification of soluble binders may also be used. For expression, selected clone(s), followed by the His\n6\n tag (SEQ ID NO: 59), are cloned into a pET9d (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) vector and are expressed in E. coli HMS174(DE3) cells. Twenty ml of an inoculum culture (generated from a single plated colony) is used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium containing 50 Î¼g/mL kanamycin. The culture is grown at 37 Â°C until A\n6\noo 0.6-1.0. After induction with 1 mM isopropyl-Î²- thiogalactoside (IPTG) the culture is grown for 6 hours at 30\n0\nC and is harvested by centrifugation for 30 minutes at >10,000 x g at 4 \n0\nC. Cell Pellets are frozen at -80 \n0\nC. The cell pellet is resuspended in 25 mL of lysis buffer (20 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, I x Completeâ¢ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail-EDTA free (Roche), 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.4) using an Ultra-turrax homogenizer (IKA works) on ice. Cell lysis is \n\n achieved by high pressure homogenization ( >18,000 psi) using a Model M-I lOS Microfluidizer (Microfluidics).\n\n\nThe soluble fraction is separated by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 23,300 g at 4 \n0\nC. The supernatant is clarified via 0.45 Î¼m filter. The clarified lysate is loaded onto a HisTrap column (GE) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.4. The column is then washed with 25 column volumes of 20 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.4, followed by 20 column volumes of 20 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 25mM imidazole pH 7.4, and then 35column volumes of 20 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 4OmM imidazole pH 7.4. Protein is eluted with 15 column volumes of column volumes of 20 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 50OmM imidazole pH 7.4, fractions are pooled based on absorbance at A\n2S\no and are dialyzed against Ix PBS, 5OmM Tris, 15OmM NaCl, pH 8.5 or 50 mM NaOAc; 15OmM NaCl; pH4.5. Any precipitate is removed by filtering at 0.22 Î¼m.\n\n\nLarge scale expression and purification of the fibronectin-based scaffold protein binders was also used. Other than the quantities produced, this method is substantially similar to the insoluble midscale purification methods.\n\n\nBiophysical Characterization of Fibronectin-based Scaffold Protein Binders\n\n\nSize exclusion chromatography (SEC). Standard size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on the proteins purified from the HTPP, midscale processes, and large scale processes (0.1 to 1 Î¼g of protein for HTPP and 10-50 Î¼g for midscale). SEC of HTPP derived material was performed using a Superdex 200 5/150 column (GE Healthcare) or on a Superdex 200 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) for midscale material on an Agilent 1 100 or 1200 HPLC system with UV detection at A\n214\n nm and A\n280\n nm and with fluorescence detection (excitation = 280 nm, emission = 350 nm). A buffer of 100 mM sodium sulfate, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.8 at appropriate flow rate of the SEC column was employed. Gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) were used for molecular weight calibration. Mass Spectrometry. The midscale and large scale purified \nl Ï\nFn3-based binders were further analyzed by LC-MS (Water's 2695 liquid chromatography HPLC system coupled with Waters Q-TOF API mass spectrometer, Waters \n\n Corporation, Milford, MA). Samples were diluted to approximately 0.5 mg/ml with HPLC grade water. Approximately 5 Î¼l of diluted sample was injected onto a Jupiter Cl 8 column (Catalog number 00G-4053-80, Phenomenex). Buffer A: 0.02% TFA + 0.08% formic acid in HPLC grade water. Buffer B: 0.02% TFA + 0.08% formic acid in HPLC grade acetonitrile. Sample was eluted with gradient (Table 1 ) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/minutes.\n\n\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis of the midscale and large scale purified \nlÏ\nFn3-based binders was performed to determine the T\nni\n. A 1 mg/ml solution was scanned in a N-DSC II calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corp) by ramping the temperature from 5 Â°C to 95 Â°C at a rate of 1 degree per minute under 3 atm pressure. The data was analyzed versus a control run of the appropriate buffer using a best fit using Origin Software (OriginLab Corp).\n\n\nDetermination of Binding Affinity Using Surface Plasmon Resonance (BIAcore) Analysis\n\n\nSelected HTPP purified fibronectin based scaffold proteins, and selected midscale and large scale versions of the tandem construct 385A08-Fn-V2B (pegylated and non-pegylated versions; his-tag and non-his-tag versions) were evaluated for their kinetic behavior towards IGF-IR using surface plasmon resonance. A capture assay was developed utilizing a human IGF-IR-Fc fusion. A similar reagent had been described by Forbes et al. (Forbes et al. 2002, European J. Biochemistry, 269, 961 -968). The extracellular domain of human IGF-IR (aa 1 -932) was cloned into a mammalian expression vector containing the hinge and constant regions of human IgG l . Transient transfection of the plasmid produced a fusion protein, IGF-IR-Fc as described next. 293T cells (a human embryonic kidney cell line expressing SV40 large T antigen) were obtained from Genehunter (Nashville, TN) and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 12 x 10\n6\n cells were seeded in Tl 75 flasks (Falcon) for transfection with the appropriate DNA preparations (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and Optimem (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Conditioned media was collected at 72 hrs and expression verified by Western blotting using anti-human IgG-HRP \n\n (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and anti-IGF-IR polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) This IGF-IR-Fc fusion protein was subsequently purified by Protein A chromatography\n\n\nOne method of obtaining kinetic measurements, which was used for the HTPP purified constructs (non-pegylated, his tag versions) was to captuie the IGF- IR-Fc on Protein A/G immobilized on Biacore CM5 chips (GE, Piscataway, NJ) by amine coupling The kinetic analysis involved the capture of IGF-IR-Fc on Protein A/G followed by injection of a concentration seÏes of the fÏbronectin based scaffold proteins in solution and regeneration of the Protein A/G surface by glycine pH 2 0 Protein concentrations from HTPP mateiial aie approximate, therefoie K\nD\n determinations are also approximate Sensorgrams were obtained at each concentration and fitted via Biaevaluation to determine the rate constants k\na\n (k\non\n) and kd (k\no\nt0 The dissociation constant, KQ, was calculated from the ratio of rate constants k\not\n( / k\non\n An alternative method is to capture the IGF-IR-Fc on Protein A This method was used for calculating the affinity and kinetics of certain versions of the construct 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys (both pegylated and non-pegylated and with or without his tag) from midscale and large scale materials Specifically, IGF-IR-Fc was captured on Protein A immobilized on a Biacore CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling VEGFR2-Fc was immobilized directly on a CM5 chip by amine coupling The affinity and kinetic analysis involved the capture of IGF-IR-Fc on Protein A followed by injection of the tandem adnectin in solution over IGF-IR-Fc and VEGFR2-Fc The analytical surface was regenerated between samples with glycine pH 1 5 Sensorgrams were obtained at each concentration and were evaluated using Biacore Tl OO evaluation softwaie to determine the rate constants k\na\n (k\non\n) and k\nc\n|\n\n\nAnothei method to assess the functionality of the IGF-IR domain is to capture the IGF-IR-Fc on anti-human IgG (GE, Piscataway, NJ) This was done for the midscale purified construct 385A08-Fn-V2B (non-pegylated, his-tag) as described in Example 5 above The anti-human IgG was immobilized on flow cells 1 and 2 of a CM5 chip surface according the manufacturer's instructions 100 nM human IGF-IR-Fc was injected for 2 minutes at 10 ul/min on flow cell 2 \n\n Subsequently a concentration series of the midscale prep was injected across both flow cell surfaces at 50 uL/min. Two injections of 50 mM Glycine pH 1.7 were used to regenerate the surface.\n\n\nThe functionality of the V2B domain was assessed by evaluating a concentration series of the midscale and large scale purification of the tandem construct 385A08-Fn-V2B (pegylated, and non-pegylated versions, his-tag and non- his-tag versions) vs. VEGFR2-Fc that was directly immobilized on a CM5 chip surface (GE, Piscataway, NJ). VEGFR2-Fc (R&D Systems, MN) was diluted tol2 ug/mL in 50 mM Acetate pH 5.0 for an immobilization level of ~ 1300 RU. Varying concentrations of 385A08-Fn-V2B in the solution phase were monitored for association (2 minutes) and dissociation (10 minutes) kinetics at a flow rate of 50 uL/min. Two 30 second injections of 50 mM glycine pH 1.7 were used to regenerate the surface.\n\n\nPegylation\n\n\nMulti-valent fibronectin based scaffold proteins, such as V/l \n10\nFn3 -based binders, can be pegylated with various sizes and types of PEG. To allow for pegylation, the protein is typically modified near the C-terminus by a single point mutation of an amino acid, typically a serine, to a cysteine. PEGylation of the protein at the single cysteine residue is accomplished by conjugating various maleimide-derivatized PEG forms, combining the PEG reagent with the protein solution and incubating. Confirmation of the PEGylation of the protein can be confirmed by SDS-Page and/or SE-HPLC methods that can separate the non- PEGylated protein from the PEGylated protein. For example, the construct 385A08-Fn-V2B was pegylated by replacing a serine that was at position 203 with a cysteine. The resulting construct, 385A08-Fn- V2B-Cys, was then conjugated with a 40 kD PEG. The PEG reagent was mixed with the protein construct (385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys) in solution and incubated. Studies to confirm the pegylation were also conducted as described in the paragraph above. Studies were also conducted on the tandem construct with linear PEG. In addition, this type of pegylation can also be done with a his-tagged protein. \n\n Additionally, the linear and branched pegylated versions of the construct 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys were used to conduct certain pharmacokinetic studies in mice to assess the difference between linear vs. branched PEG. Both were 40 kD PEGs, and the linear version of this construct also included a his-tag. V/l \nl Ï\nFn3-based binders may also be pegylated using an alternative method.\n\n\nFive ml of an inoculum culture of BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells containing a T7 ploymerase driven pET29 plasmid encoding a V/I \nl0\nFn3-based binder is generated from a single plated colony and used to inoculate 1 liter of auto-induction media (\"ONE\" medium, EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) containing 50 Î¼g/mL kanamycin. Expression is earned out at 18 \n0\nC after initial growth at 37 \n0\nC and harvested by centrifugation for 10 minutes at -10,000 x g at 4 \n0\nC. Cell pellets are frozen at 80 \n0\nC. The cell pellet is resuspended in 10 mL of lysis buffer (20 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM Immidazole, pH 7.4) and mechanically lysed using an Avestin homgenizer. The soluble fraction is separated by centrifugation for 15 minutes at 23,300 x g at 4 \n0\nC. The supernatant is decanted and the pellet is solubilized in Lysis buffer (above) supplemented with 4 M to 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). Solubilized protein is then purified on a suitably sized NiNTA column (Qiagen, Inc.) pre-equilibrated with the GdnHCL supplemented Lysis Buffer. The column is then washed with 5 to 10 column volumes of the same buffer, followed by elution with the same buffer supplemented with 300 mM Immidazole. The fractions eluted off the column containing the protein of interest are diluted to 2-3 mgs/mL protein and then combined with a 1.2-1.5 molar excess of solid NEM-PEG (40 kDa branched or other). The mixture is allowed to react at room temperature for 30 minutes or until the reaction is complete. The entire reaction volume is then placed into a dialysis bag (5,000 Da Molecular Weight cutoff) and the mixture is subjected to a dialysis refolding process. The dialysate from this procedure contains properly folded, PEGylated materials plus excess reactants. The mixture of products and excess reactants from the PEGylation reaction are clarified via centrifugation or filtration prior to loading them onto a cation exchange chromotography column (SP Sepharose or Resource S, GE Healthcare). The column is developed with 150 mM to 1 M NaCl gradient in the \n\n NaOAc background buffer. Studies to confirm the pegylation are conducted as described above.\n\n\nCompetitive Blocking Assays R\n+\n Competitive Blocking Assay. R\n+\n, a gift from Renato Baserga (Thomas\n\n\nJefferson University, Philadelphia, PA), is a mouse embryo fibroblast overexpressing human IGF-IR in the context of a deletion in the mouse IGF-IR gene. Cells were plated in 96 well plates at a concentration of 20,000 cells per well in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 5% calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). The following day, cells were washed twice in serum free DMEM containing 0.1 % BSA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After the washes, the cells were incubated at 4Â° C for 10 minutes in binding buffer (serum free DMEM + 0.1 % BSA) containing increasing concentrations of IGF-IR antagonists or controls. Typical controls included the mono-specific \nl0\nFn3-based IGF-IR binder (AT580-PEG40, SEQ ID NO: 27) (positive control) or the mono-specific \nl 0\nFn3-based VEGFR2 binder (Peg- V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28) (negative control). Following this brief exposure to antagonists, R\n+\n cells were additionally exposed to 200 nM of a bi-valent \nl0\nFn3-based IGF-IR binder (AT580-PEG20-AT580, SEQ ID NO: 27) labeled with IRDye 800CW according to the manufacturer instructions (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). After incubation for 4 hours at 4Â° C, cells were washed twice in binding buffer and visualized on the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).

The following day, cells were washed twice in serum free DMEM containing 0.1 % BSA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After the washes, the cells were incubated at 4Â° C for 10 minutes in binding buffer (serum free DMEM + 0.1 % BSA) containing increasing concentrations of VEGFR-2 antagonists or controls. Typical controls included the mono-specific \nl 0\nFn3-based VEGFR2 binder (Peg-V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28) (positive control) or the mono-specific \nl 0\nFn3-based IGF-IR binder (AT580- \n\n PEG40, SEQ ID NO: 27) (negative control). Following this bÏef exposure to antagonists, 293:KDR cells were additionally exposed to 200 nM Peg-V2Bshort labeled with IRDye 800CW according to the manufacturer instructions (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) After incubation for 4 hours at 4Â° C, cells were washed twice in binding buffer and visualized on the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li- Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) The resulting data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).\n\n\nIn Vitro Proliferation Assays RH41 RH41 cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM Hcpes, glutamax, penicillin and streptomycin. Cell proliferation was evaluated by [\n3\nH]-thymidine incorporation or coloÏmetÏc methods. For evaluation of [\n3\nH] -thymidine incorporation, cells were plated at an optimized density (4K cells/well) in 96-well plates, incubated overnight at 37Â° C, then exposed to a serial dilution of the fÏbronectin based scaffold proteins. After 72 hours incubation, cells were pulsed with 4 Î¼Ci/ml [\n3\nH]-thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) for 3 houis, trypsinized, harvested onto UniFilter-96 GF/B plates (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) and scintillation was measured on a TopCount NXT (Packard, CT) Results were expressed as an IC50, which is the drug concentration required to inhibit cell proliferation by 50% compared to untreated control cells The mean IC50 and standard deviation from multiple tests for each cell line were calculated. For coloÏmetÏc evaluation, cells were plated in 96 well plates at a concentration of 5,000 cells per well in 90 ul/well of RPMI-glutamax (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and incubated for 24 hours, 37Â° C, 5% CO\n2\n. 10 ul of 1 OX concentrations of \nl Ï\nFn3-based IGF-IR antagonists were added to the wells and incubated for 72 hours at 37Â° C, 5% CO\n2\n. After the proliferation period, cells were exposed to Cell Titer 96 Aqueous Proliferation Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) and allowed to incubate for an additional four hours. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured on a Spectramax Plus 384 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and the resulting data was analyzed using Softmax Pro 5 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). \n\n Ba/F3. Murine Ba/F3 cells stably expressing a VEGFR2 fusion protein (comprising the extracellular domain of hVEGFR2 and the intracellular domain of hEpoR) were plated in 96-well plates at 25.000 cells/well in 90 uL growth media containing 15 ng/mL VEGF-A. Serial dilutions of fibronectin scaffold domain proteins were prepared at 10x final concentration, and 10 uL of the protein was added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37Â° C/5% CO\n2\n for 48-72 hours. Cell proliferation assay reagent (CellTiter 96, Promega) was added to each well (20 Î¼L/well), and the plates were further incubated for 3-4 hours. At the end of the incubation period, absorbance was read (A490) in a 96-well plate reader. HMVEC-L. Primary human microvascular endothelial cells from Lung\n\n\n(HMVEC-L), were purchased from Lonza (Cat# CC-2527; Walkersville, MD) and maintained in EGM-2 MV Singlequots (Lonza, Cat# CC-3202), then switched to RPMI- 1640 + Glutamax supplemented with 2% Heat Inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 10 mM Hepes, 15 ng/ml recombinant Human VEGF (Biosource), and 50 ng/ml recombinant Human IGF-I (PeproTech) for the growth assay. Proliferation was evaluated by incorporation of [ H]-thymidine into DNA after exposure of cells to compounds in the presence of 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS). Typical controls included the following: IGF-IR monoclonal antibody mAB391 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), a mono-specific \n10\nFn3-based IGF-IR binder (AT580-PEG40, SEQ ID NO: 27), a mono-specific \nl0\nFn3-based VEGFR-2 binder (Peg-V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28), and a wild type \nl 0\nFn3-based protein that does not bind to a target (SGE). HMVEC-L cells were plated at 1 ,500 cells/well in 96-well microtiter Falcon plates (cell density was optimized for this cell type). After 72 hours incubation at 37Â° C, cells were pulsed with 4 Î¼Ci/ml [6-\n3\nH] thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) for 3 hours, trypsinized, harvested onto UniFilter-96 GF/B plates (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA), and scintillation counts were measured on a TopCount NXT (Packard, CT). Results are expressed as the drug concentration required for inhibition of cellular proliferation by 50% to that of untreated control cells (IC\n50\n).\n\n\nNCI-H929. NCI-H929 (ATCC, Manassas, VA), an IGF-dependent human plasmacytoma cell line, was plated in 96 well plates at a concentration of 25,000 cells per well in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) in the presence of IGF-IR antagonists or controls. \n\n Typical controls included the following: IGF-IR monoclonal antibody MAB391 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), a mono-specific \nl 0\nFn3-based IGF-IR binder (AT580-PEG40, SEQ ID NO: 27), a mono-specific \nl 0\nFn3-based VEGFR-2 binder (Peg-V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28), and a wild type \nl 0\nFn3-based protein that does not bind to a target (SGE).

Absorbance at 490 nm was measured on a Spectramax Plus 384 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and the resulting data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).\n\n\nCell-Based Signal Transduction Assays\n\n\nHEK293/KDR and PAE/KDR Assays. HEK293/KDR and PAE/KDR cells (Sibtech, Inc) were cultured in DMEM with GlutaMAXâ¢-l (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, streptomycin, HEPES and puromycin, and grown to ~70% confluency. Cells were placed into starvation medium (DMEM-GlutaMAX, 0.5% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, HEPES and puromycin) overnight at 37Â° C, then stimulated with VEGF or IGF-I (50 ng/ml, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 10 min at 37Â° C. Unstimulated cells were included as controls. Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS on ice and extracts were prepared in TTG lysis buffer ( 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, Complete tablet (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 (Sigma, Milwaukee, Wl). Protein concentrations of total cell lysates were determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

Unstimulated cells served as controls.\n\n\nRh41 cells were cultured in RPMI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FCS), penicillin, streptomycin, and HEPES, and grown to ~70% confluence. Rh41 is a human rhabdomyosarcoma tumor cell line which was obtained from Dr. Lee Helman (NlH), and maintained in RPMI-1640 + Glutamax, in the presence of 10% FCS, 1 OmM HEPES; Rh41 cells are IGF-dependent and are very sensitive to inhibition by antagonists of IGF-I R (i.e., small molecules, mononectins, and mAB391 ). Rh41 cells were placed into starvation medium (RPMI, 0.3% BSA) overnight at 37Â° C. Test reagents were diluted in starvation media and added to cells at a final concentration of 100 nM for 1 hour at 37Â° C. Cells were stimulated with a combination of VEGF and IGF-I ligands (50 ng/ml each), for 10 min at 37Â° C. Typical controls included the following: Unstimulated cells, IGF-I R monoclonal antibody mAB391 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), a monospecific \nl 0\nFn3-based IGF-IR binder (AT580-PEG40, SEQ ID NO: 27), or a monospecific \nl ()\nFn3-based VEGFR-2 binder (Peg-V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28).\n\n\nHMVEC-L or Rh41 cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS on ice and extracts were prepared in TTG lysis buffer (1 % Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, Complete Tablet (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 (Sigma, Milwaukee, WI). Protein concentrations of total cell lysates were determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). \n\n Equal amounts of protein from each lysate (40 ug) were added to each well of a gel (NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Proteins were separated on a NuPAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and incubated in Odyssey Blocking buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences) for 1 hr at room temperature. Inhibition of phosphorylation was measured by probing Western blots with antibodies specific for IGF-IR (Phospho-IGF-l RÎ², (Tyrl 135/1 136)/IR, (Tyrl 150/1 151 ) (19H7) Antibody, (Cell Signaling #3024)), IGF-I RÎ² (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. sc-713), Akt (pAkt (Ser473) (Cell Signaling #4051 )), Akt (Cell Signaling #9272), MAPK (p-p44/42) MAPK (Thr202/Tyr2040) (El O) (Cell Signaling #9106), (MAPK Cell Signaling #9102), and VEGFR-2 (pFlk-1 ) (Tyr996)-R, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. sc-16629R), VEGFR-2 (FIk-I ) (C-1 158), (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. sc-504), total GAPDH (Cell Signaling #21 18) in Odyssey Blocking Buffer with 0.1 % Tween 20 (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NB), for 3 hrs at room temperature. Membranes were washed 3 times in TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 and then incubated with IR-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. Protein analysis was performed utilizing the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences) which enables simultaneous and independent detection of fluorescent signals.\n\n\nCa2+ Flux Assays\n\n\nHMVEC-L cells were plated at 2.5 x 10\n4\n cells/well on poly-D-Lysine-coated 96-well plates (Falcon # 356640) in EGM2-MV Singlequots complete media (Lonza, Cat# CC-3202). Cells were starved overnight in basal EBM media (Lonza). The day of the assay, test reagents were serial diluted in HHP buffer (10 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM probenecid [Sigma #P8761 ] in HBSS [GibcoBRL #14025-076] + 0.1 % BSA) and added to the cells after aspirating EBM media. Calcium-4 dye kit (Molecular Devices, #R8142) was added at the same time as the HHP buffer, and cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37Â° C. Ca2\n+\n release was triggered by the addition of 50 ng/ml VEGF (Invitrogen #PHG0145). Ca2\n+\n flux was monitored by measurement on a FLIPR (Molecular Devices). \n\n Human Microvascular Endothelial Cell Tube Formation\n\n\nMatrigelâ¢ plates were prepared by thawing Matrigelâ¢ (BD Biosciences, #356237) overnight at 4Â° C. Matrigelâ¢ (300Î¼l/well) was added to a 24-well plate and subsequently incubated at 37Â° C for 30 minutes in order for the gel to polymerize. HMVEC-L cells were cultured in EGM-2MV complete media (Lonza, Cat# CC-3202), and grown to -70% confluence. The cells were resuspended (1 x10\n5\n cells/ml) with test compounds (100 nM) or without compounds in EGM-2MV complete media. 1 ml of the cell suspension was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 12 hrs at 37Â° C, in 5% CO\n2\n. The growth medium was aspirated and 1 ml of 0.3% Glutaraldehyde (VWR, #GX015305-1 ) was added to each well at room temperature for 30 minutes. The media was aspirated and cells were washed with 1 ml wash buffer (Cell Spreading Reagent Kit, Pierce, #K060001 1 ). 500 Î¼l of permeabilization solutions were added followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. The media was aspirated and cells were washed with 1 ml wash buffer. 500 Î¼l of stain solution was added to each well and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 hr. The solution was removed by aspiration and washed 3x with wash buffer. The plates were sealed, and imaged on an ArrayScan HCS Reader. The angiogenic index, which is a measure of the imaged area occupied by microvascular tubes, was automatically calculated and reported for each well.\n\n\nSingle-Dose PK in Mice\n\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys (SEQ ID NO: 9) pegylated with 40 kD linear or 40 kD branched PEG was studied in mice. Two groups of non- fasted animals (N = 3-4 per group, 20-25 g) received Adnectin as an intravenous (IV) bolus doses via the tail vein (5 mL/kg). The dose was 50 mg/kg. Prior to dosing, the compound was diluted from a stock solution to an appropriate dosing solution concentration in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Serial blood samples (-0.05 mL) were obtained by nicking the lateral tail vein. For the IV route, the sampling time points were 0.08, 0.5, 1 , 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, and 171 h post dose. Plasma samples were harvested by diluting blood sample into a citrate phosphate dextrose solution in a 1 : 1 ratio and were stored at -20Â° C until analysis. \n\n Single-dose PK/PD Study in Rh41-Tumored Mice\n\n\nPharmacodynamic studies were conducted in Rh41 tumored-mice using increasing concentrations after a single dose of a pegylated, his-tag version of construct 385A08-Fn0V2B-Cys (50, 100, 200 mpk), or a combination of a mono- specific \nl0\nFn3-based IGF-IR binder (AT580-PEG40, SEQ ID NO: 27) and a monospecific \nl0\nFn3-based VEGFR-2 binder (Peg-V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28) at equivalent doses (25+25, 50+50, 100+100). Tumors were harvested at 1 , 6, and 24 hrs after dosing and processed. Equal amounts of protein from each tumor Iysate (60 Î¼g) were added to each well of a gel (NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Proteins were separated on a NuPAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and incubated in Odyssey Blocking buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences) for 1 hr at room temperature. Inhibition of phosphorylation of proteins was measured by probing Western blots with phospho-specific antibodies as described above.\n\n\nTumor Xenograft Studies RH-41, A549 and GEO, in Mice\n\n\nFemale Balb/c athymic mice (nu/nu), 5-6 weeks of age were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley Co. (Indianapolis, IN). Animals were maintained in an ammonia and pathogen-free environment and fed water and food ad libitum. Mice were maintained in quarantine for 7 days prior to tumor implantation and efficacy testing. All animal studies were performed under the approval of the BMS Animal Care and Use committee and in accordance with the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).\n\n\nHuman tumors Rh-41 (rhabdomyosarcoma), A549 (lung) and GEO (colon) were implanted subcutaneously (sc) as small fragments generally no larger than 0.1 to 0.2 mm\n3\n using a 16 g trocar. All tumors that were evaluated were allowed to grow to an approximate size of 125 mm\n3\n prior at the initiation of treatment. The treatment and control group sizes consisted of 6 - 8 mice. Tumor size was measured twice weekly. Tumor volume was calculated by measuring perpendicular tumor diameters using Vernier scale calipers and using the foÏnula for an ellipsoid: 1/2 (length x (width)\n2\n). Mice were euthanized if the tumor size surpassed 1 ,500 mm\n3\n, if animal weight loss was greater than 20% of the starting weight or if \n\n extensive tumor necrosis occurred. All compounds were obtained internally and dosed by intraperitoneal (i.p.) delivery using a 25 g sterile hypodermic needle. Vehicle control solution was generally phosphate buffered saline (PBS) while a mono-specific \nl0\nFn3-based VEGFR-2 binder (Peg-V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28) was dosed in a formulation of 10 mM Sodium Acetate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 4.5; a monospecific \n10\nFn3-based IGF-IR binder (AT580-PEG40, SEQ ID NO: 27) was formulated in PBS and pegylated, his-tagged construct 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys (SEQ ID NO: 9) was formulated in 50 mM Sodium Acetate, 150 mM NaCl, pH, 4.5.\n\n\nAnti-tumor efficacy is expressed as percent tumor growth inhibition (% TGI) and calculated as follows:\n\n\n% TGI = {1-[(T,-T\nO\n)/(C,-C\nO\n)]} x 100 where Q = the median tumor volume (mm\n3\n) of vehicle control (C) mice at time, t; T\n1\n = median tumor volume (mm\n3\n) of treated mice (T) at time t; Co = median tumor volume (mm\n3\n) of vehicle control (C) mice at time 0; T, = median tumor volume (mm\n3\n) of treated mice (T) at time 0. Greater than or equal to 50% TGI over one tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) is considered an active anti-tumor response. TVDT is measured over the linear growth range of the tumor, generally between 250 mm\n3\n - 1000 mm\n3\n tumor size.\n\n\nTumor Xenograft Study in A673 Model.\n\n\n(J) Tumor Cell Line. Human A673 Ewing Sarcoma cells (CRL- 1598) were cultured following the instructions recommended by ATCC. Briefly, cells were maintained in base medium Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium, (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37\" C under a 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere.\n\n\n(2) Xenograft Model. 10 x 10\n6\n cells resuspended in 0.1 ml of PBS were injected subcutaneously in the dorsal flank region of female, seven to eight-week old, female athymic NCr nude mice (Taconic Farms, Hudson, NY). Mice were housed in microisolator cages under HEPA filtered-air and temperature controlled barrier racks. They were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle, fed with irradiated food and autoclaved water available ad libitum, and allowed to adapt to their new environment. Mice were manipulated using aseptic protocols and all experimental \n\n procedures and end point of tumor studies followed institutional guidelines. Tumor implantation was monitored using caliper measurements to establish tumor growth rate before randomization and mice were randomized when tumors reached an average of 150-200 mm\n3\n. Mice were euthanized when tumors reached a volume of 3,000 mm\n3\n.\n\n\n(3) Treatments. Mice from each study were assigned to treatment groups described below and received intraperitoneal administration at the regimens indicated below. The vehicle group received a mono-specific ' Fn3-based VEGFR-2 binder (Peg-V2Bshort, SEQ ID NO: 28) in reconstitution buffer: 10 mM Sodium Acetate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 4.5. A mono-specific \n10\nFn3-based IGF-IR binder (AT580-PEG40, SEQ ID NO: 27) was formulated in PBS and pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys (SEQ ID NO: 9) was formulated in 50 mM Sodium Acetate, 150 mM NaCl, pH, 4.5. For the study described in Figure 26, there were six treatment groups, each consisting of 9 mice that were dosed on a three times a week (TIW) schedule of either vehicle, 50 mg/kg (mpk) of Peg-V2Bshort, 50 mpk of AT580-PEG40, 50 mpk of pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys, 100 mpk of pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys, or a co-dose of 50 mpk of AT580- PEG40 and 50 mpk of Peg-V2Bshort. In the dose response study discussed above (data not shown), there were five treatment groups, each consisting of 9 mice that were dosed on a TIW schedule of either vehicle, or 20, 60, 100, or 200 mpk of pegylated, his-tagged 385A08-Fn-V2B-cys.\n\n\n(4) Tumor volume measurements. Tumor volume measurements were performed twice a week using Vernier scale calipers and tumor volumes (mm\n3\n) were calculated using the ellipsoid formula [Ï/6 (LxW\n\"\n)], where L represents the largest tumor diameter (mm) and W represents the smallest tumor diameter (mm). Tumor measurements were noted as absolute values. Animal body weights were recorded twice a week during the course of the experiment.\n\n\n(5) Tumor Growth Inhibition (TGl). TGl was calculated as the percent tumor growth of treated (T) groups from control group (vehicle, C). Tumor growth was calculated by subtracting initial tumor volume (at day 0) from the final tumor volume at the end of the experiment. TGI = (l -[T-T\n0\n]/[C-C\n0\n])* 100. \n\n PK/PD Study Methods for Mouse and Monkey Models\n\n\nDetermination of Concentration in Serum or Plasma\n\n\nA quantitative electrochemiluminescence assay was developed to detect the concentration of 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys (with and without his tag) in serum or plasma samples. In this assay, a mouse monoclonal antibody specific to the VEGFR2 portion of the molecule was adsorbed to a standard Meso Scale Discovery plate to capture the adnectin overnight at 4 Â°C. The serum/plasma sample was added to the plate for one hour incubation at room temperature. The captured adnectin was detected by a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to the scaffold region of the adnectin which was co-mixed with a goat anti-rabbit antibody linked with a SULFO- TAG, and added to the plate simultaneously. Following a wash to remove any unbound SULFO-TAG reagent, a read buffer is added to each well and electrochemiluminescense detection is used to detect binding events. 385A08-Fn- V2B-Cys (with and without his tag) plasma/serum concentrations in samples were calculated based on the signal of the sample compared to a 4 parameter fit of a standard curve of 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys (with and without his tag). Determination of VEGF-A Concentrations in Mice and Monkeys\n\n\nA quantitative electrochemiluminescence assay for human and murine VEGF-A from Meso Scale Discovery (Gaithersburg, MD) was employed to detect VEGF-A plasma concentration according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specific anti-VEGF-A monoclonal antibodies are pre-coated onto Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) plates. The plate is blocked overnight at 4 Â°C and VEGF-A present in the standards, QCs and samples are captured during a 2 hour incubation step by the immobilized antibody. After washing away any unbound substances, a SULFO-TAG linked polyclonal detection antibody is added to the wells for 2 hours. Following a wash to remove any unbound SULFO-Tag reagent, a read buffer is added to each well and electrochemiluminescense detection is used to detect binding events. Plasma VEGF-A concentrations in samples were calculated based on the signal of the sample compared to a 4 parameter fit of a standard curve. In Vivo Methods - Mouse\n\n\nSingle-dose Pharmacokinetics in Mice. The pharmacokinetics of his-tagged version of 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys was studied in nude mice. Four groups of non- \n\n fasted animals (N = 3-4 per group, 20-25 g) received his-tagged version of 385A08- Fn-V2B-Cys either as an intravenous (IV) bolus dose via the tail vein (5 mL/kg) or as an intraperitoneal (IP) dose (10 mL/kg). The doses were 5 and 50 mg/kg for both routes. Prior to dosing, the compound was diluted from a stock solution to an appropriate dosing solution concentration in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Serial blood samples (-0.05 mL) were obtained by nicking the lateral tail vein. For the IV route, the sampling time points were 0.08, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, and 171 h post dose. For the IP route, the sampling time points were 0.5, 1 , 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 124, and 171 h post dose. Plasma samples were harvested by diluting blood sample into a citrate phosphate dextrose solution in a 1 :1 ratio and were stored at -20 \n0\nC until analysis.\n\n\nSingle-dose Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Study in Nude Mice Bearing the Rh41 Tumor. His-tagged version of 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys was dosed intraperitoneally to non-fasted nude mice (20-25 g) bearing the Rh41 tumor at doses of 20 and 200 mg/kg along with a vehicle group. Prior to dosing, the drug candidate was diluted from a stock solution to an appropriate dosing solution concentration in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture at 1 , 3, 6, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 80 h post dose in the drug-treated groups and 1 , 24, and 36 post dose in the vehicle group. Serum samples were obtained after coagulation and stored at -20 Â°C until analysis for drug and VEGF-A concentrations.\n\n\nSingle-dose Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Study in Nude Mice Bearing the A673 Tumor. 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys (non-his tagged) was dosed intraperitoneally to non-fasted nude mice (20-25 g) bearing the A673 tumor at doses of 20 and 200 mg/kg. Prior to dosing, the drug candidate was diluted from a stock solution to an appropriate dosing solution concentration in PBS. Plasma samples were harvested by cardiac puncture into sodium heparin coated BD vacutainer tubes at 1 , 3, 6, 16, 24, 32, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h post dose, and were stored at -20Â°C until analysis for drug and VEGF-A concentrations. In Vivo Methods - Monkey Single-dose Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Study in Monkeys. The pharmacokinetics of his-tagged version of 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys was evaluated in male cynomolgus monkeys. Following an overnight fast, 2 animals (~4 kg) received \n\n his-tagged version of 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys at doses of 3 and 30 mg/kg by a constant-rate IV infusion (5 mL/kg) for 10 min via the femoral vein. Prior to dosing, the drug candidate was diluted from a stock solution to an appropriate dosing solution concentration in PBS. Blood samples (~1 mL) were collected into K\n2\nEDTA tubes from the femoral artery at predose and 0.17, 0.25, 0.5, 1 , 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 30, 54, 72 (day 3), 96 (day 4), 168 (day 7), 216 (day 9), 264 (day 1 1), 336 (day 14), 384 (day 16), 432 (day 18), 504 h (day 21) post dose. Plasma samples were obtained after centrifugation at 4 Â°C (1500-2000*g) and stored at -20 Â°C until analysis for drug and VEGF-A concentrations. Using the same study design, 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys (non-his tagged) was studied at 3 mg/kg following IV administration to male cynomolgus monkeys (N = 3, ~4 kg). After the 3-week study and additional 3-week washout period, 385A08- Fn-V2B-Cys (non-his tagged) was re-dosed to the same monkeys at the same dose, with blood samples collected up to a week post dose. Data Analysis\n\n\nThe data are expressed as mean Â± standard deviation (SD). The pharmacokinetic parameters of 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys (his tagged and non-his tagged) were obtained by non-compartmental analysis of plasma (serum) concentration vs. time data (KINETICAâ¢ software, Version 4.2, InnaPhase Corporation, Philadelphia, PA). The peak concentration (Cmax) and time for Cmax were recorded directly from experimental observations. The area under the curve from time zero to the last sampling time (AUC(O-T)) and the area under the curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(INF)) were calculated using a combination of linear and log trapezoidal summations. The total plasma clearance (CLTp), steady-state volume of distribution (Vss), terminal half-life (Tl /2) and mean residence time (MRT) were estimated after IV administration. Estimations of AUC and Tl/2 were made using a minimum of 3 time points with quantifiable concentrations.\n\n\nThe pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data of 385A08-Fn- V2B-Cys (his tagged and non-his tagged) generated in mice and monkeys were modeled using the SAAM Il (version 1.2.1 , Seattle, WA). For the mouse PK data obtained after IV and IP doses of 5 and 50 mg/kg, the naive-pooled serum \n\n concentration-time data were simultaneously fitted using a two-compartment model coupled with first-order absorption kinetics.\n\n\nThe PD response, measured as either mVEGF-A or hVEGF-A concentrations in plasma or serum, was modeled using an indirect response model, with the assumptions that the production of VEGF-A was not altered in the presence of 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys (his tagged and non-his tagged) and binding of VEGF-A to VEGFR-2, as its major clearance pathway, was blocked by 385A08-Fn-V2B-Cys (his tagged and non-his tagged)."

Description\n\n\n\n\n CRYSTALLINE PYRID AZINE COMPOUND\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\nThe hepatitis C virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense RNA virus in the tamÏlyFlaviviridae. HCV mainly replicates within hepatocytes in the liver. Circulating HCV particles bind to receptors on the surfaces of hepatocytes and subsequently enter the cells. Once inside the hepatocyte, HCV utilizes the intracellular machinery necessary to accomplish its own replication. Lindenbach, B. Nature 436(7053) :932-8 (2005). The HCV genome is translated to produce a single protein of around 3011 amino acids. This \"polyprotein\" is then proteolytically processed by viral and cellular proteases to produce three structural (virion-associated) and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins.\n\n\nHCV encodes two proteases, the NS2 cysteine autoprotease and the NS3-\n\n\n4A serine protease. The NS proteins then recruit the viral genome into an RNA replication complex, which is associated with rearranged cytoplasmic membranes. RNA replication takes places via the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of NS5B, which produces a negative-strand RNA intermediate. The negative strand RNA then serves as a template for the production of new positive-strand viral genomes. Nascent genomes can then be translated, further replicated, or packaged within new virus particles. New virus particles presumably bud into the secretory pathway and are released at the cell surface. \n\n HCV has a high rate of replication with approximately one trillion particles produced each day in an infected individual. Due to lack of proofreading by the HCV RNA polymerase, HCV also has an exceptionally high mutation rate, a factor that may help it elude the host's immune response.\n\n\nBased on genetic differences between HCV isolates, the hepatitis C virus species is classified into six genotypes (1-6) with several subtypes within each genotype. Subtypes are further broken down into quasispecies based on their genetic diversity. The preponderance and distribution of HCV genotypes varies globally. For example, in North America genotype Ia predominates followed by 1, 2a, 2b, and 3a. In Europe genotype 1 is predominant followed by 2a, 2b, 2c, and 3a. Genotypes 4 and 5 are found almost exclusively in Africa. Genotype is clinically important in determining potential response to interferon-based therapy and the required duration of such therapy. Genotypes 1 and 4 are less responsive to interferon-based treatment than are the other genotypes (2, 3, 5 and 6). Duration of standard interferon-based therapy for genotypes 1 and 4 is 48 weeks, whereas treatment for genotypes 2 and 3 is completed in 24 weeks.\n\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that world- wide 170 - 200 million people (3% of the world's population) are chronically infected with HCV. Approximately 75% of these individuals are chronically infected with detectable HCV RNA in their plasma. These chronic carriers are at risk of developing cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. In studies with a 7-16 years follow-up, 7-16 % of the patients developed cirrhosis, 0.7-1.3% developed hepatocellular carcinoma and 1.3-3.7% died of liver-related disease.\n\n\nThe only treatment option available today is the use of interferon Î±-2 (or its pegylated form) either alone or combined with ribavirin. However, sustained response is only observed in about 40% of the patients and treatment \n\n is associated with serious adverse effects. There is thus an urgent need for potent and selective inhibitors of HCV.\n\n\nRelevant disclosures include U.S. Patent Nos. 4,914,108; 4,988,707; 4,990,518; 5,137,896; 5,208,242; 5,227,384; 5,302,601; 5,374,638; 5,405,964; 5,438,063; 5,486,525; 6,479,508; and U.S. Patent Publication No. US2003/0108862 Al, Canadian Patent No. 2423800 Al, German Patent Nos. 4211474 Al, 4236026, 4309969, 4318813, European Patent Nos.

It is believed to be a hydrate (hereafter \"amorphous\" compound (I)).\n\n\nIt is an object of this invention to provide compound (1) in crystalline form.\n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\nIn accordance with achieving the foregoing objects of this invention, a crystalline compound is provided having formula (1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\nand its salts, which is substantially free of amorphous compound (1) .\n\n\nIn an embodiment, the crystalline compound (1) is the free base substantially free of amorphous compound (1) and any other crystal form of compound (1). \n\n Another embodiment of this invention is a method for making crystalline compound (1)\n\n\n \n\n (1) comprising crystallizing compound (1) from crystallization solvent and controlling the amount of water in the crystallization solvent.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a composition is provided that comprises crystalline free base compound (1) which is substantially free of the chloride salt of compound (1).\n\n\nCrystalline compound (1) is useful in a method for therapy or prophylaxis of HCV infection comprising administering to a subject a therapeutic or prophylactic dose of crystalline compound (1). Another embodiment comprises the use of crystalline compound (1) for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of an HCV infection in a mammal (more specifically a human).\n\n\nAnother embodiment of this invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions of the crystalline formula (1) compound comprising at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. In one embodiment the compound of formula (1) is formulated with an organic acid and optionally formulated into a \n\n pharmaceutical dosage form such as a capsule. In another embodiment, crystalline compound (1) is micronized and formulated as a suspension.\n\n\nCrystalline compound (1) or the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are employed in the treatment or prophylaxis of hepatitis C.\n\n\nCrystalline compound (1) exhibits improvements in pharmacological features and cost advantages, in particular improved purity, storage stability and manufacturing reproducibility. A particular advantage is its higher melting point as compared to the amorphous form.\n\n\nOther features of this invention, including novel intermediates and product compositions, will be apparent from consideration of this application as a whole. \n\n\n\n\nFigures\n\n\nFigure 1 depicts an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern obtained for crystalline compound (1) reference standard obtained by the method of example 1.\n\n\nFigure 2 depicts another X-ray powder diffraction pattern obtained for crystalline compound (1).\n\n\nFigure 3 is an X-ray powder diffraction pattern obtained for the amorphous form of compound (1) Research Lot 6, obtained by the method of Example Ia in WO 08/005519.\n\n\nFigure 4 illustrates a DSC thermogram obtained for crystalline compound (1) reference standard, lÂ°C/min scan, obtained by the method of Example 1 below. Figure 5 shows a DSC thermogram obtained for the amorphous form of compound (1) Research Lot 6, 5Â°C/min scan, obtained by the method of Example Ia in WO 08/005519.\n\n\nDetailed Description of the Invention Crystalline compound (1) is defined as a solid comprising compound (1) in which the constituent molecules are packed in a regularly ordered repeating pattern extending in all three spatial dimensions. Identification of crystallinity is readily accomplished in a number of ways known to those skilled in the art. Microscopic examination of the test composition often will reveal the presence of regular shapes, suggesting ordered internal structure. In the case of the crystal embodiment produced in example 1, the regular shape generally is rod or needle-like.\n\n\nXRPD is another method for identifying crystalline compound (1). The regularly ordered structure of constituent molecules in a crystal diffracts \n\n incident x-rays in a distinct pattern depicted as a spectrum of peaks. This pattern of peaks for crystalline compound (1) is shown in Figures 1 and 2. On the other hand, Figure 3 depicts an XRPD for substantially amorphous compound (1), which lacks distinct peaks. While the XRPD peaks for crystalline compound (1) may vary in intensity the same general pattern will be present in replicate x-ray diffraction analysis.\n\n\nCrystalline compound (1) exhibits an XRPD dominant peak(s) at about 17 degrees theta 20, ordinarily 17.4 and 17.5. By \"about\" applicants mean within the typical variation in measurement of XRDP peaks. Such variations may result from the use of different instruments, instrument settings, batches of product, post-crystallization processing such as micronization or milling, and with varying sample preparation methods. In general, \"about\" means + 0.5 degree theta 20. An example of this sort of variation can be seen by comparing Figures 1 and 2. In particular, peak intensity (e.g., at about 30) may vary due to crystal orientation effects.\n\n\nIllustrative examples of other dominant peaks for crystalline compound (1) are at about 8, 10, 13, 16, 19 and 24 degrees theta 20, ordinarily 8.4, 10.0, 13.5, 15.7, 16.8, 16.9, 18.8 and 24.4. Any one or more of these peaks (but especially, 8, 10, 15.7, 16.7 and 16.9, with or without the peaks at about 17, are suitably employed to define the XRDP for crystalline compound (1).\n\n\nThe identification of a crystal form of compound (1) need not require the presence of any one or more of the dominant peaks seen in Figures 1 or 2. Rather, the presence or absence of dominant peaks ordinarily is taken into account with other diagnostic characteristics (e.g., DSC thermogram) to identify a candidate as crystalline compound (1). \n\n Crystalline compound (1) also is characterized by DSC thermogram, which reveals an endothermic onset at about 235Â°C in differential scanning calorimetry profile. Typically, some variation in this measurement also will be encountered (usually, + 1 - 3Â°C).\n\n\nCrystalline compound (1) also is characterized by its heat of fusion (DHf) of about 81 J/g (42 KJ/mole).\n\n\nCrystalline compound (1) is made by a process comprising dissolving compound (1) in solvent and forming crystals therefrom. Typical solvents for use herein are ethyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol or a cosolvent containing ethyl acetate and isopropyl alcohol. Other suitable solvents are obtained from the solubility map in McConville, F. X. \"Pilot Plant Real Book\" (2002) which plots the dielectric constant and Hildebrand solubility parameter for a variety of solvents.\n\n\nSolvents close to ethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol on the map (dielectric 2.5-20 and Hildebrand 15-24) are ethyl ether, isobutyl acetate, butyl acetate, anisole, chlorobenzene, chloroform, methyl acetate, THF, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, 1,2-dichlorobenzeke, methylisobutylketone, methylethylketone, cyclohexanone, acetone, 1-butanol, 2-methoxyethanol, isobutanol, 2-butanol, cyclohexanol, isoamyl alcohol, pyridine, methyl formate, 1-pentanol, and/or 2-butoxyethanol.\n\n\nSome of these solvents would not be preferred due to toxicity issues, but this could be overcome by careful solvent removal from the product. It will be within the skill of the ordinary artisan to conduct laboratory screening to determine suitability of a candidate solvent for the preparation of crystalline \n\n compound (1). Combinations of these solvents also fall within the scope of the invention.\n\n\nA key finding facilitating the preparation of crystalline compound (1) is that the water content of the crystallization solvent must be controlled in order to obtain and/or optimize the production of crystalline product. For example, when using ethyl acetate as solvent, the upper limit on water content is about 0.6% to 0.9% by weight.\n\n\nAn additional consideration with regard to water content is its use to remove other forms of compound (1) that are less soluble than the crystalline free base in liquid lipophilic pharmaceutical carriers. For example the chloride salt of compound (1) is less soluble than the free base in the fatty acid solutions employed as carriers herein. In sufficiently large amounts such salts produce an undesirable haze in the pharmaceutical product. The final synthetic step of example 1 produces a mixture of free base together with minor amounts of the chloride salt. The haze-producing chloride salt is removed by first dissolving the product in a solvent containing a relatively high amount of water (about 3% - 10%) at alkaline pH. Refluxing in this solvent assures that there is enough water to back convert the chloride salt to the free base. Thereafter, the crystalline free base is crystallized from this solvent. This process optionally is repeated with decreasing water concentrations to gradually remove the chloride salt from the product. The final step is then accomplished with low water content (usually less than about 0.9% water) in order to crystallize the free base substantially free of the amorphous compound (1). In general, haze in the pharmaceutical preparation is not encountered when the chloride content in the final product is ordinarily less than about 100 ppm. The amounts of water employed will vary depending upon the concentration of contaminating \n\n chloride salt and other experimental variables determinable by the skilled artisan. In summary, the water content of the crystallization solvent is controlled, both to convert chloride (or other relatively water soluble salts of compound (I)) and to avoid generation of amorphous compound (1).\n\n\nThe amount of permitted water for each function will vary depending upon the solvent or solvents employed for crystallization, the concentration of compound (1), the temperature of the crystallization step, the time of crystallization, the tolerable amount of amorphous compound (1), and other variables. Hence, it will be incumbent upon the artisan to determine the optimal water level for obtaining the desired results, usually by conducting a typical variable matrix study. The lowest water concentration for avoiding generation of the amorphous compound (1) is more a matter of practical economics. For example, 0.05% water by weight is acceptable.\n\n\nIn general, the final crystallization step is conducted in substantially anhydrous solvent. Substantially anhydrous solvent is defined as solvent containing a sufficiently small amount of water that the resulting product contains crystalline compound (1) and is substantially free of amorphous compound (1), typically less than about 40%, ordinarily less than about 30, 20, 10, 5, 3, 2 or 1% by weight of amorphous compound (1) in the total of all forms of compound (1) in the product composition.\n\n\nIn general, substantially anhydrous solvent will about 0.5% - 0.9% water by weight of the crystallization solvent. However, more water can be present if the desired product is permitted to contain the greater proportions of amorphous compound (1). However, it is optimal if the compound (1) composition is free of detectable amorphous compound (1). \n\n The water content is controlled by any manner results in the proper amount of water in the crystallization step concerned. When formation of amorphous compound (1) is to be avoided, suitable techniques for minimizing or reducing the amount of water include adding drying agents and/or azeotropically removing water. It is most convenient to remove water during reflux dissolution of compound (1) just prior to crystallization. Of course, control of water content includes adding water as well, as will typically be the case during steps to convert the chloride salt.\n\n\nAmorphous compound (1) optionally is used as starting material for crystallization (form conversion). Alternatively, crystallization is conducted directly from the final reaction products without an intermediate recovery of amorphous compound (1). The crystallization typically is conducted by providing or dissolving compound (1) in solvent or solvent mixture at reflux (sufficient to dissolve compound (1), about 1 to 5 hours), followed by cooling to about 18-23Â°C over 4 - 8 hours, then optionally agitated for about 8 to 20 hours at about 18-23Â°C. Agitation is optional but increases the rate of crystallization. Reflux is not critical since all that is necessary is that compound (1) be placed in solution. However, refluxing compound (1) has the advantage of rapidly dissolving compound (1) and azeotropically removing water at the same time. Water is controlled before crystallization starts or during crystallization, or both, although in general it is best to reduce water below the desired limit before any compound (1) can precipitate as the amorphous polymorph.\n\n\nGeneration of amorphous material is optimized by using relatively longer crystallization times, higher temperatures and lower concentrations of compound (1). Determining the various optimal crystallization process parameters are well within the skill of the ordinary artisan. \n\n An embodiment herein is a composition made by the process of combining crystalline compound (1) with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and forming a pharmaceutical dosage form such as a tablet or capsule. The resulting product need not contain crystalline compound (1). While it is expected that dosage forms made from crystalline compound (1) will contain only compound (1) in crystalline form. However, in some embodiments the crystalline compound (1) is an intermediate for dissolution in the carrier or excipient.\n\n\nThe crystalline compound (1) of this invention is administered to a subject mammal (including a human) by any means well known in the art, i.e. orally, intranasally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intradermally, intravenously, intra-arterially, parenterally or by catheterization in a therapeutically effective amount, i.e., an HCV-inhibiting amount or an HCV- replication inhibiting amount. This amount is believed to be an amount that ensures a plasma level of about 100 nM, 3 times the protein-adjusted EC90. This ordinarily is expected to be achieved by daily oral administration of about 0.5 - about 5 mg/kg, typically about 0.7 to 2.2 mg/kg, most ordinarily about 1.2 mg/kg bodyweight for humans.\n\n\nThe optimal dosage of the compound of this invention will depend upon many factors known to the artisan, including bioavailability of the compound in a given formulation, the metabolism and distribution of the compound in the subject, the fasted or fed state of the subject, selection of carriers and excipients in the formulation, and other factors. Proper dosing typically is determined in the preclinical and clinical settings, and is well within the skill of the ordinary artisan. The therapeutically effective amount of the compound of this invention optionally is divided into several sub-units per day or is administered daily or \n\n in more than one day intervals, depending upon the nature of the infection, the patient's general condition and the formulation of the compound of this invention. Generally, the compound is administered twice daily.\n\n\nThe compound of this invention is employed in concert with other agents effective against HCV infections. They optionally are administered separately in a course of therapy, or are combined with compound (1) in a unitary dosage form such as tablet, iv solution or capsule. Such other agents include, for instance, interferon-alpha, ribavirin, and/or compounds falling within the disclosures of EP1162196, WO 03/010141, WO 03/007945, WO 00/204425 and/or WO 03/010140 (and other filings within their patent families). Other agents for administration in a course of therapy with the compound of this invention include compounds now in clinical trials, in particular HCV protease inhibitors such as VX-950 (Vertex Pharmaceuticals), SCH 5030347 (Schering Plough) and BILN-2061 (Boehringer Ingelheim), nucleoside HCV inhibitors such as NM283, NMl 07 (both Idenix/Novartis) and Rl 626 (Hoffmann-LaRoche), and non- nucleoside HCV inhibitors including HCV-086 and -796 (both ViroPharma/Wyeth). Supplementary antiviral agents are used in conventional amounts. If the efficacy of the compound of this invention and the supplementary compound are additive then the amounts of each active agent optionally are commensurately reduced, and more so if the agents act synergistically. In general, however, the agents are used in their ordinary active amounts in unitary combination compositions.\n\n\nCo-administered agents generally are formulated into unitary compositions with the compound of this invention so long as they are chemically compatible and are intended to be administered by the same route. \n\n If not, then they optionally are provided in the form of a medical kit or package containing the two agents in separate repositories or compartments.\n\n\nThe compound of this invention typically is provided as the free base, but also optionally is prepared as a salt. Salts typically are prepared by acid addition of organic and/or inorganic acids to the free base. Examples include (1) inorganic acids such as hydrohalogen acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and sulfamic acids; or (2) organic acids such as acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, benzoic, 2-hydroxypropanoic, 2- oxopropanoic, lactic, fumaric, tartaric, pyruvic, maleic, malonic, malic, salicylic (e.g. 2-hydroxybenzoic), p-aminosalicylic, isethionic, lactobionic, succinic, oxalic and citric acids; organic sulfonic acids, such as methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, C1-C6 alkylsulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p- toluenesulfonic, and cyclohexanesulfamic acids. Typical salts are the chloride, sulfate, bisulfate, mesylate, besylate, esylate, phosphate, oxalate, maleate, succinate, citrate, malonate, and/or fumarate salts. Also included within the scope of this invention are the salts of the compound of this invention with one or more amino acids, typically naturally-occurring amino acids such as one of the amino acids found in proteins. The acidic counterion desirably is physiologically innocuous and non-toxic or otherwise pharmaceutically acceptable, unless the salt is being used as an intermediate in preparation of the compounds whereupon toxicity is not relevant. Ordinarily, compound (1) will be administered as the free base, but suitable salts include mesylate (methanesulfonic acid) and HCl.\n\n\nThe compound of this invention includes the solvates formed with the compound of this invention or their salts, such as for example hydrates, alcoholates and the like. \n\n The pharmaceutical compound of this invention optionally is formulated with conventional pharmaceutical carriers and exÎ¬pients, which will be selected in accord with ordinary practice. Tablets will contain excipients, glidants, fillers, binders and the like. Aqueous formulations are prepared in sterile form, and when intended for delivery by other than oral administration generally will be isotonic. Formulations optionally contain excipients such as those set forth in the \"Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients\" (2005) and include ascorbic acid and other antioxidants, chelating agents such as EDTA, carbohydrates such as dextrin, hydroxyalkylcellulose, hydroxyalkylmethylcellulose and/or organic acids such as oleic acid or stearic acid.\n\n\nThe term \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" as used herein means any material or substance formulated with the active ingredient in order to facilitate its preparation and/or its application or dissemination to the site to be treated. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers for use in the compositions of this invention are well known to those skilled in the art. They include additives such as wetting agents, dispersing agents, adhesives, emulsifying agents, solvents, glidants, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents (for example phenol, sorbic acid, chlorobutanol), and isotonic agents (such as sugars or sodium chloride), provided that the same are consistent with pharmaceutical practice, i.e. they are not toxic to mammals.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are prepared in any known manner, for instance by homogeneously mixing, coating and/or grinding the active ingredients in a one-step or multi-step procedure, with the selected carrier material and, where appropriate, other additives such as surface-active agents. Compositions containing the compound of this invention \n\n formulated into microspheres (usually having a diameter of about 1 to 10 gm) are useful as controlled or sustained release formulations.\n\n\nIn one optional formulation, compound (1) is comminuted to a finely divided form, typically to an average particle size at any point within the range of about 1 - 20 microns. The product of example 1 is rods or needles and exhibits a range of crystal length, typically about 25 - 40 microns. These optionally are micronized in a Jet mill-00 at about 60-80 psi to obtain particles of about 3-4 microns and having surface area of about 7-8 square meters/g. However, the starting crystal sizes will vary from lot to lot and the degree of micronization is a matter of choice. Accordingly, micronized crystalline compound (1) is simply defined as crystal or amorphous compound (1) that has been subject to a micronization process such as the exemplary one described here. Neither the size nor surface area of the resulting particles is critical. The micronized compound (1) is suspended in aqueous solution, optionally aided by a suspending agent, emulsifiers and/or surfactant as further described below.\n\n\nTypically, the pharmaceutical formulation is a solubilized form of compound (1) where crystalline compound (1) is dissolved in an appropriate solvent or solubilizing agent, or combinations thereof. Crystalline compound (1) is solubilized in a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient for administration therapeutically or prophylactically.\n\n\nSuitable solutions of compound (1) for pharmaceutical preparations include water together with various organic acids (typically C4 - C24) usually fatty acids like capric, oleic, lauric, capric, palmitic and/or myristic acid. The fatty acids are optionally saturated or unsaturated, or mixtures thereof. In addition, polyethylene glycols (PEGs) and/or short, medium, or long chain \n\n mono, di, or triglycerides are employed supplementary to, or in place of, the organic acids. Pegylated short, medium or long chain fatty acids optionally also are used in the same fashion.\n\n\nThe most common organic acids are the carboxylic acids whose acidity is associated with the carboxyl group -COOH. Sulfonic acids, containing the group OSO3H, are relatively stronger acids for use herein. In general, the acid desirably contains a lipophilic domain. Mono- or di-carboxylic acids are suitable.\n\n\nSuitable surface-active agents optionally are used with any of the formulations of this invention (any one or more of the following agents, typically any one of them). Such agents also are known as emulgents or emulsifiers, and are useful in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention. They are non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic materials having suitable emulsifying, dispersing and/or wetting properties. Suitable anionic surfactants include both water-soluble soaps and water-soluble synthetic surface-active agents. Suitable soaps are alkaline or alkaline-earth metal salts, unsubstituted or substituted ammonium salts of higher fatty acids (C10-C22), e.g. the sodium or potassium salts of oleic or stearic acid, or of natural fatty acid mixtures obtainable from coconut oil or tallow oil. Synthetic surfactants include sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids; fatty sulphonates and sulphates; sulphonated benzimidazole derivatives and alkylarylsulphonates. Fatty sulphonates or sulphates are usually in the form of alkaline or alkaline-earth metal salts, unsubstituted ammonium salts or ammonium salts substituted with an alkyl or acyl radical having from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, e.g. the sodium or calcium salt of lignosulphonic acid or dodecylsulphonic acid or a mixture of fatty alcohol sulphates obtained from natural fatty acids, alkaline or alkaline- \n\n earth metal salts of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters (such as sodium lauryl sulphate) and sulphonic acids of fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide adducts. Suitable sulphonated benzimidazole derivatives preferably contain 8 to 22 carbon atoms. Examples of alkylarylsulphonates are the sodium, calcium or alcoholamine salts of dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid or dibutyl-naphthalenesulphonic acid or a naphthalene-sulphonic acid/formaldehyde condensation product. Also suitable are the corresponding phosphates, e.g. salts of phosphoric acid ester and an adduct of p-nonylphenol with ethylene and/or propylene oxide, or phospholipids. Suitable phospholipids for this purpose are the natural (originating from animal or plant cells) or synthetic phospholipids of the cephalin or lecithin type such as e.g. phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerine, lysolecithin, cardiolipin, dioctanylphosphatidyl-choline, dipalmitoylphoshatidyl -choline and their mixtures. Aqueous emulsions with such agents are within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nSuitable non-ionic surfactants include polyethoxylated and polypropoxylated derivatives of alkylphenols, fatty alcohols, fatty acids, aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule, alkylarenesulphonates and dialkylsulphosuccinates, such as polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic and cycloaliphatic alcohols, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and alkylphenols, said derivatives preferably containing 3 to 10 glycol ether groups and 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the (aliphatic) hydrocarbon moiety and 6 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety of the alkylphenol. Further suitable non-ionic surfactants are water-soluble adducts of polyethylene oxide with poy Iy propylene glycol, ethylenediaminopolypropylene glycol containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, which adducts contain 20 to 250 ethyleneglycol ether groups and/or 10 to 100 propyleneglycol ether groups. \n\n Such compounds usually contain from I to 5 ethyleneglycol units per propyleneglycol unit. Representative examples of non-ionic surfactants are nonylphenol -polyethoxyethanol, castor oil polyglycolic ethers, polypropylene/polyethylene oxide adducts, tributylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol, polyethyleneglycol and octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol. Fatty acid esters of polyethylene sorbitan (such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate), glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose and pentaerythritol are also suitable non-ionic surfactants.\n\n\nSuitable cationic surfactants include quaternary ammonium salts, particularly halides, having 4 hydrocarbon radicals optionally substituted with halo, phenyl, substituted phenyl or hydroxy; for instance quaternary ammonium salts containing as N-substituent at least one C8 - C22 alkyl radical (e.g. cetyl, lauryl, palmityl, myristyl and oleyl) and, as further substituents, unsubstituted or halogenated lower alkyl, benzyl and/or hydroxy-lower alkyl radicals.\n\n\nA more detailed description of surface-active agents suitable for this purpose is found in \"McCutcheon's Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual\" (MC Publishing Crop., Ridge wood, New Jersey, 1981), \"Tensid-Taschenbucw\", 2nd ed. (Hanser Verlag, Vienna, 1981) and \"Encyclopedia of Surfactants,\" (Chemical Publishing Co., New York, 1981).\n\n\nThe compound of this invention is administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated, such as oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including ocular, buccal and sublingual), vaginal and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural). The preferred route of administration may vary with for example the condition of the recipient, but is generally oral. \n\n Formulations of the compound of this invention for oral administration usually are presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granular form; as a solution or suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non- aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in- water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The compound of this invention optionally is presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.\n\n\nA tablet is made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets are prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the compound of the invention in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active and/or dispersing agent. Molded tablets typically are made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein.\n\n\nThe formulations are optionally applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w/w (including active ingredient(s) in a range between 0.1% and 20% in increments of 0.1% w/w such as 0.6% w/w, 0.7% w/w, etc), preferably 0.2 to 15% w/w and most preferably 0.5 to 10% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the compound is employed with a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the compound is formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base. If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e. an alcohol having two or \n\n more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethylsulfoxide and related analogs.\n\n\nThe oily phase of the emulsions of this invention is constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While this phase may comprise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Optionally, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.\n\n\nThe choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties. Thus the cream should optionally be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferred esters. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties \n\n required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is optionally present in such formulations in a concentration of 0.5 to 20%, advantageously 0.5 to 10% particularly about 1.5% w/w.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.\n\n\nFormulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate. Formulations suitable for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500 microns (including particle sizes in a range between 20 and 500 microns in increments of 5 microns such as 30 microns, 35 microns, etc), which is administered by aerosol or powder inhalers, of which numerous examples are available. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as for example a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations \n\n containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations are presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.\n\n\nThe compound of this invention optionally is formulated into controlled release compositions in which the release of the compound is controlled and regulated to allow less frequency dosing or to improve the pharmacokinetic or toxicity profile of the invention compound. Controlled release compositions are prepared in accord with known methods, many of which involve formulating the active compound with one or more polymer carriers such a polyester, polyamino acid, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose and/or protamine sulfate. The rate of drug release and duration of action optionally is controlled by incorporating the active ingredient into particles, e.g. microcapsules, of a polymeric substance such as hydrogels, polylactic acid, hydroxymethylcellulose, polymethyl methacrylate and the other above-described polymers. Also suitable are colloid drug delivery systems such as liposomes, microspheres, microemulsions, \n\n nanopartides, nanocapsules and so on. Depending on the route of administration, the pharmaceutical composition, e.g., tablets, may require protective coatings.\n\n\nThe invention will be more fully appreciated by reference to the following examples, which are to be considered merely illustrative and not limiting the scope of the invention.\n\n\nComposition percentages are by weight unless otherwise apparent from the context.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nSynthesis of Crystalline 5-((6-(2,4-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pyridazin-3- yl)methyl)-2-(2-fluorophenyÏ-5H-imidazo[4,5-clpyridine\n\n\nScheme 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a reactor, containing 2\n/\n4-bis(trifluoromethyl)bromobenzene (1.00 eq) and tetrahydrofuran (THF), was charged Isopropyl magnesium chloride \n\n (\n1\nPrMgCl) (2 M in THF, 1.14 eq) while maintaining the content at -10Â°C.

The remaining samples were crystalline compound (1). The samples were subjected to measurement using a Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) apparatus (DSC2010, manufactured by TA Instruments Corporation), under nitrogen atmosphere, sample weight 5 Â±1 mg, temperature rise rate: either 1Â°C per min, 5Â°C per min or 10Â°C per min, open aluminum pan, and indium standard as a reference.

A sample was fixed to an aluminum cell, and the measurement was performed using an X-ray powder diff ractometer (XRD-6000, Shimadzu Lab X, manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation, X-ray source: Cu- KÎ±l ray, tube voltage: 35 kV, tube electric current: 40 mA, scan speed: 2\ne\n per min, continuous scan mode, sampling pitch: 0.02\ns\n, scan range: 4 - 35\nQ\n, Î² axis rotation: 60 rpm).\n\n\nNon-micronized, ascicular compound (1) crystals obtained by the method of this invention have an X-ray powder diffraction pattern having characteristic diffraction peaks at diffraction angles 2Î (\nQ\n) of 13.46, 15.59, 16.90, 17.48, 23.05 and 30.15 as measured by X-ray powder diffractometer (Figure 1). Note that the non-micronized \"high melt\" 235Â°C melt ascicular crystal form of compound (1) tested in this example shows some effects due to preferred \n\n orientation and particle size. As a result, Figure 1 should be considered merely exemplary because varying the crystal size and orientation will change the magnitude of the peaks in the plot. Additionally, the diffraction peak value at the above mentioned diffraction angle 2Î (\ns\n) may show slight measurement error due to the measurement instrument or measurement conditions and the like. Typically, the measurement error generally is within the range of about Â±0.3. The specification for the Shimadzu XRD-6000 is Â±0.04. Further, some variation in peak positions can be expected due to product and experimental variation, so they must be considered approximate.\n\n\nThe 220Â°C \"low melt\" solid state form of compound (1) comprised by product made according to the example Ia method (or in the method herein prior to the reslurry step) gives an X-ray powder diffraction pattern consistent with amorphous material (Figure 3).\n\n\nCompound (1) by the method of this invention typically exhibits intrinsic solubility of 0.7 micrograms/ml, a pKa of 5.8, log P of 2.8; and geometric mean (3 lots) pH solubility profile at pH 2 of 458 micrograms/ml and at pH 7.3, 0.7 micrograms/ml.

The blend was granulated by spraying the blend solution. The granules were dried in a fluid-bed. The dried granules were sized by passing through a mill, and then blended with additional microcrystalline cellulose and croscarmellose sodium. The powder blend was lubricated by adding magnesium stearate and then compressed into tablets using a rotary tablet press. The tablets were subsequently film-coated.\n\n\nThe table below is a summary of various formulations tested in dogs dosed at 40 mg compound (1), corresponding to approximately 4 mg/kg. The table illustrates the superior performance of the solubilized compound (1) formulations. \n\n\n\n\nIn-vivo Data Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n3\n Utilizes micronized API b Dosed in dogs treated with pentagastrin to reduce stomach pH\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nAntiviral Activity of Compound (1)\n\n\nThe compound of this invention exhibits anti-HCV replicon activity (assay described in WO 05/063744) against both genotypes Ia and 1, extremely low cytotoxicity (>50,000 nM in Huh-7, HepG2 and MT4 cells), and a highly favorable selectivity index. The compound is substantially less active against genotype 2a.\n\n\nActivity of Compound 1 Against HCV Genotype 1 and Ia Replicons\n\n\nHCV genotype 1 (Con-1/lucneo) and Ia (H77/neo) replicon cells were incubated with serial dilutions of compound (1) 2'C-methyl adenosine (2'CMeA) or IFNÎ± for 3 days in the absence or presence of 40 mg/mL human serum albumin (HSA). After incubation, replicon RNA levels in the treated \n\n cells were determined by either a luciferase reporter assay (1 replicon) or a quantitative real-time PCR assay (Ia replicon) and the data points were used to calculate EC50 (50% effective inhibiting concentration) values for the inhibitors. Compound (1) was shown to inhibit both genotype 1 and genotype Ia replicons with EC50 values of 0.6 and 3.6 nM, respectively (Table A). In the presence of human serum albumin, the EC50 value of Compound (1) was increased to 11 nM.\n\n\nTable A: Activity of Compound (1) against HCV Genotypes Ia and 1 Replicons\n\n\n \n\n n.d., not determined; HSA, human serum albumin a Mean EC50 value and standard error determined from at least 4 independent experiments\n\n\nActivity of Compound (1) Against HCV Genotype Ia Replicon and Virus\n\n\nThe antiviral activity of compound (1) against HCV genotype 2a was tested in cells chronically infected with the genotype 2a virus as well as in cells replicating a subgenomic 2a replicon. Huh-7 cells containing chronically replicating HCV genotype 2a (J6/JFH-Rluc) virus or subgenomic replicons were cultured with compound (1) or 2'CMeA for 3 days in the absence of human serum albumin. After cultivation, the amount of luciferase in 2a-virus containing cells and HCV NS3 protease activity in the 2a replicon-containing \n\n cells was determined using Promega's lucif erase assay and a novel time- resolved fluorescence assay, respectively.\n\n\nThe antiviral activity of compound (1) was significantly reduced in both the HCV-2a chronically infected cell culture model (EC50 = 2.9 Î¼M) and the 2a\n\n\nsubgenomic replicon model (EC50 = 21.9 Î¼M) compared to Huh-7 cells\n\n\nreplicating an HCV-I subgenomic replicon (EC50 = 0.0006 Î¼M) (Table 2). Taken together, these results suggest that the reduction in potency for compound (1) against HCV genotype 2a may be due to the genotypic differences between genotype 1 and genotype 2 of HCV.\n\n\nTable B: Activity of Compound (1) against HCV Genotypes 1 and 2a\n\n\n \n\n n.d., not determined; HSA, human serum albumin a Mean EC50 value and standard error determined from at least 4 independent experiments\n\n\nCompound (1) was evaluated for its cytotoxicity in a variety of cell types including HCV replicon-containing cell lines (Huh-7, SL3 and MH4) and non- replicon-containing cell lines (HepG2, MT4), using a CellTiter-Glo Luminescence Cell Viability assay (Promega). No toxic effects were observed in any of the cell lines at the highest concentration tested (50 Î¼M) (Table C). These results, coupled with its potent antiviral activity (EC50 = 0.62-3.6 nM) in HCV-I \n\n and HCV-Ia replicons, indicates a high selectivity index (CC50/ EC5O>13,000- 80,000) for compound (1).\n\n\nTable C: Cytotoxicity of compound (1) in HCV Replicon Containing Cell .Lines\n\n\n \n\n n.d., not determined; HSA, human serum albumin a Mean CC50 value and standard error determined from at least 4 independent experiments b HCV replicon-containing cell lines\n\n\nAnti-HCV Activity of Compound (1) in Combination with IFN In Vitro Pegylated interteron-Î± (PEG-IFN-Î±), in combination with ribavirin, represents the current standard of care for HCV-infected patients. In vitro combination studies of compound (1) and IFN-Î± were performed in replicon cells. Data was analyzed using the MacSynergy template developed by Prichard and Shipman. Results from these studies suggest an additive interaction between compound (1) and IFN-Î±.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nAntiviral, Pharmacokinetic and Safety Data for Compound (1) in a Phase-1, First-In-Human Trial in HCV Genotype 1 -Infected Subjects.\n\n\nA randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial was designed to evaluate the safety /tolerability, phamacokinetics and antiviral activity of single\n\n\n(in Part A) and multiple (in Part B) doses of Compound (1) (oleic acid solution, \n\n above) in subjects chronically infected with HCV genotype 1 (GT-I) without decompensated cirrhosis. Prospective subjects are 18-60 years of age, are HCV treatment naive, and are in general good health.\n\n\nIn completed Part A, five successive cohorts of 6 subjects were randomized (5:1) to receive single ascending doses of Compound 1 (40, 120, 240, 240-with food, or 480 mg) or placebo. In ongoing Part B, four successive cohorts of 12 subjects are randomized (10:2) to receive multiple ascending doses of Compound 1 (40 mg BID, 120 mg BID, 240 mg QD, 240 mg BID) or placebo, over 8 days.\n\n\nThirty -one subjects enrolled in Part A were of mean age 43.6 years, predominantly male (20/31), Caucasian (25/31), and infected with either HCV Genotype-la (24) or 1 (6). Median (range) baseline HCV viral load was 6.6 Log\n10\n RNA IU/mL (5.2-7.3). Single doses of compound (1) were well tolerated, with no serious or treatment-limiting adverse events (AEs) reported. The most common AE was headache. All AEs were mild in severity, with the exception of one moderate headache. There were no Grade 3 or 4 treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities.\n\n\nMedian compound (1) plasma half-life ranged from 10 to 15 hours across cohorts. Systemic exposure was increased approximately 2-fold when compound (1) was administered with a high fat meal. Mean compound (1) concentration 24 hours after the 240 mg fasted dose dosing was ~7-fold higher than the protein binding adjusted in vitro HCV GT-I Replicon ECso value. Following single-dose exposure, maximal antiviral effect was observed at 24 hours, with median declines ranging from 0.46 to 1.49 Log\n10\n HCV RNA IU/mL \n\n across cohorts. Individual HCV RNA declines among all compound (1) recipients ranged from 0.19 to 2.54 log\n10\n IU/mL following single-dose exposure.\n\n\nThis is the first clinical demonstration of antiviral activity of compound (1). Single dose exposure to compound (1) was well tolerated, demonstrated favorable PK properties and potent antiviral activity."

Description\n\n\n\n\n ORGANIC COMPOUNDS\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates generally to the field of inhibitors of stearoyl-CoA desaturase, such as heterocyclic derivatives, and uses for such compounds in treating and/or preventing various human diseases, including those mediated by stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) enzymes, preferably SCDl, especially diseases related to elevated lipid levels, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, dermatological disorders and the like.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nAcyl desaturase enzymes catalyze the formation of a double bond in fatty acids derived from either dietary sources or de novo synthesis in the liver. In mammals, at least three fatty acid desaturases exists, each with differing specificity: delta-9, delta-6, and delta-5, which introduce a double bond at the 9-10, 6-7, and 5-6 positions respectively.\n\n\nStearoyl-CoA desaturases (SCDs) act with cofactors (other agents) such as NADPH, cytochrome b5, cytochrome b5 reductase, Fe, and molecular O\n2\n to introduce a double bond into the C9-C10 position (delta 9) of saturated fatty acids, when conjugated to Coenzyme A (CoA). The preferred substrates are palmitoyl-CoA (16:0) and stearoyl- CoA (18:0), which are converted to palmitoleoyl-CoA (16:1) and oleyl-CoA (18:1), respectively. The resulting mono-unsaturated fatty acids are substrates for further metabolism by fatty acid elongases or incorporation into phospholipids, triglycerides, and cholesterol esters. A number of mammalian SCD genes have been cloned. For example, two genes have been identified in humans (hSCDl and hSCD5) and four SCD genes have been isolated from mouse (SCDl, SCD2, SCD3, and SCD4). While the basic biochemical role of SCD has been known in rats and mice since the 1970's (Jeffcoat, R. et al., Eur. J. Biochem. (1979), Vol. 101, No. 2, pp. 439-445; de Antueno, R. et al, Lipids (1993), Vol. 28, No. 4, pp. 285-290), it has only recently been directly implicated in human disease processes. \n\n The two human SCD genes have been previously described: hSCDl by Brownlie et al, PCT published patent application, WO 01/62954, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and hSCD2, PCT published patent application, WO 02/26944, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nTo date, the only small-molecule, drug-like compounds known that specifically inhibit or modulate SCD activity are found in the following PCT Published Patent Applications: WO 06/034338, WO 06/034446, WO 06/034441, WO 06/034440, WO 06/034341, WO 06/034315, WO 06/034312, WO 06/034279, WO 06/014168, WO 05/01 1657, WO 05/011656, WO 05/011655, WO 05/011654 and WO 05/011653. SCD inhibitors have also been described in by Zhao et al., Biorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 2007, and PCT Published Patent Applications WO 06/130986 and WO 07/009236.\n\n\nBefore the discovery of the above compounds, only certain long-chain hydrocarbons, analogs of the substrate stearic acid, had been used to study SCD activity. Known examples include thia-fatty acids, cyclopropenoid fatty acids, and certain conjugated linoleic acid isomers. Specifically, cis-12, trans-10 conjugated linoleic acid is believed to inhibit SCD enzyme activity and reduce the abundance of SCDl mRNA, while cis-9, trans- 11 isomer of conjugated linoleic acid does not have this biological activity. Cyclopropenoid fatty acids, such as those found in stercula and cotton seeds, are also known to inhibit SCD activity. For example, sterculic acid (8-(2 octylcyclopropenyl)octanoic acid) and malvalic acid (7-(2-oclylcyclopropenyl)heptanoic acid) are C 18 and C 16 derivatives of sterculoyl and malvaloyl fatty acids, respectively, having cyclopropene rings at their C9-C10 position. These agents must be coupled to CoA to act as inhibitors and are believed to inhibit SCD enzymatic activity by direct interaction with the enzyme complex, thus inhibiting delta-9 desaturation. Other agents that may inhibit SCD activity include thia-fatty acids, such as 9-thiastearic acid (also called 8-nonylthiooctanoic acid) and other fatty acids with a thioester moiety.\n\n\nThere is a major unmet need for small molecule inhibitors of SCD enzyme activity because evidence is now compelling that SCD activity is directly implicated in common human disease processes: See e.g., Attie, A.D. et al, \"Relationship between stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity and plasma triglycerides in human and mouse \n\n hypertriglyceridemia\", J.

As such these compounds inhibit the formation of various fatty acids and downstream metabolites thereof. This may lead to an accumulation of stearoyl-CoA or palmitoyl-CoA and other upstream precursors of various fatty acids; which may possibly result in a negative feedback loop causing an overall change in fatty acid metabolism. Any of these consequences may ultimately be responsible for the overall therapeutic benefit provided by these compounds.\n\n\nTypically, a successful SCD inhibitory therapeutic agent will meet some or all of the following criteria. Oral availability should be at or above 20%. Animal model efficacy is less than about 20 mg/Kg, 2 mg/Kg, 1 mg/Kg, or 0.5 mg/Kg and the target human dose is between 10 and 250 mg/70 Kg, although doses outside of this range may be acceptable. (\"mg/Kg\" means milligrams of compound per kilogram of body mass of the subject to whom it is being administered). The required dosage should preferably be no more than about once or twice a day or at meal times. The therapeutic index (or ratio of toxic dose to therapeutic dose) should be greater than 10. The ICs\n0\n (\"Inhibitory Concentration - 50%\") is a measure of the amount of compound required to achieve 50% inhibition of SCD activity, over a specific time period, in an SCD biological activity assay. Any process for measuring the activity of SCD enzymes, preferably mouse or human SCD enzymes, may be utilized to assay the activity of the compounds useful in the methods of the invention in inhibiting said SCD activity. Compounds of the invention demonstrate an IC\n50\n (\"Inhibitory Concentration of 50%\") in a 15 minute microsomal assay of preferably less than 10 Î¼M, less than 5 Î¼M, less than 2.5 Î¼M, less than 1 Î¼M, less than 750 nM, less than 500 nM, less than 250 nM, less than 100 nM, less than 50 nM, and most preferably less than 20 nM. Compounds of the invention may show \n\n reversible inhibition (i.e., competitive inhibition) and preferably do not inhibit other iron binding proteins.\n\n\nThe identification of compounds of the invention as SCD inhibitors was readily accomplished using the SCD enzyme and microsomal assay procedure described in Shanklin J. and Summerville C, Proc. Natl Acad. ScL USA (1991), Vol. 88, pp. 2510- 2514. When tested in this assay, compounds of the invention had less than 50% remaining SCD activity at 10 Î¼M concentration of the test compound, preferably less than 40% remaining SCD activity at 10 Î¼M concentration of the test compound, more preferably less than 30% remaining SCD activity at 10 Î¼M concentration of the test compound, and even more preferably less than 20% remaining SCD activity at 10 Î¼M concentration of the test compound, thereby demonstrating that the compounds of the invention are potent inhibitors of SCD activity.\n\n\nThese results provide the basis for analysis of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) between test compounds and SCD. Certain-groups tend to provide more potent inhibitory compounds. SAR analysis is one of the tools those skilled in the art may employ to identify preferred embodiments of the compounds of the invention for use as therapeutic agents. Other methods of testing the compounds disclosed herein are also readily available to those skilled in the art. Thus, in addition, the determination of the ability of a compound to inhibit SCD may be accomplished in vivo. In one such embodiment this is accomplished by administering said chemical agent to an animal afflicted with a triglyceride (TG)- or very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-related disorder and subsequently detecting a change in plasma triglyceride level in said animal thereby identifying a therapeutic agent useful in treating a triglyceride (-TG)- or very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-related disorder. In such embodiment, the animal may be a human, such as a human patient afflicted with such a disorder and in need of treatment of said disorder.\n\n\nIn specific embodiments of such in vivo processes, said change in SCDl activity in said animal is a decrease in activity, preferably wherein said SCDl modulating agent does not substantially inhibit the biological activity of a delta-5 desaturase, delta-6 desaturase or fatty acid synthetase or other enzymes containing Fe at the active site.\n\n\nThe model systems useful for compound evaluation may include, but are not \n\n limited to, the use of liver microsomes, such as from mice that have been maintained on a high carbohydrate diet, or from human donors, including persons suffering from obesity. Immortalized cell lines, such as HepG2 (from human liver), MCF-7 (from human breast cancer) and 3T3-L1 (from mouse adipocytes) may also be used. Primary cell lines, such as mouse primary hepatocytes, are also useful in testing the compounds of the invention. Where whole animals are used, mice used as a source of primary hepatocyte cells may also be used wherein the mice have been maintained on a high carbohydrate diet to increase SCD activity in mirocrosomes and/or to elevate plasma triglyceride levels (i.e., the 18:1/18:0 ratio); alternatively mice on a normal diet or mice with normal triglyceride levels may be used. Mouse models employing transgenic mice designed for hypertriglyceridemia are also available. Rabbits and hamsters are also useful as animal models, especially those expressing CETP (cholesterol ester transfer protein).\n\n\nAnother suitable method for determining the in vivo efficacy of the compounds of the invention is to indirectly measure their impact on inhibition of SCD enzyme by measuring a subject's Desaturation Index after administration of the compound.\n\n\n\"Desaturation Index\" as employed in this specification means the ratio of the product over the substrate for the SCD enzyme as measured from a given tissue sample. This may be calculated using three different equations 18:ln-9/18:0 (oleic acid over stearic acid); 16:ln-7/16:0 (palmitoleic acid over palmitic acid); and/or 16:ln-7 + 18:ln- 7/16:0 (measuring all reaction products of 16:0 desaturation over 16:0 substrate).\n\n\nDesaturation Index is primarily measured in liver or plasma triglycerides, but may also be measured in other selected lipid fractions from a variety of tissues. Desaturation Index, generally speaking, is a tool for plasma lipid profiling.\n\n\nA number of human diseases and disorders are the result of aberrant SCDl biological activity and may be ameliorated by modulation of SCDl biological activity using the therapeutic agents of the invention.\n\n\nInhibition of SCD expression may also affect the fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids, as well as production or levels of triglycerides and cholesterol esters. The fatty acid composition of phospholipids ultimately determines membrane fluidity, with a subsequent modulation of the activity of multiple enzymes present within the membrane, while the effects on the composition of triglycerides and cholesterol esters \n\n can affect lipoprotein metabolism and adiposity.\n\n\nIn carrying out the procedures of the present invention it is of course to be understood that reference to particular buffers, media, reagents, cells, culture conditions and the like are not intended to be limiting, but are to be read so as to include all related materials that one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize as being of interest or value in the particular context in which that discussion is presented.\n\n\nFor example, it is often possible to substitute one buffer system or culture medium for another and still achieve similar, if not identical, results. Those of skill in the art will have sufficient knowledge of such systems and methodologies so as to be able, without undue experimentation, to make such substitutions as will optimally serve their purposes in using the methods and procedures disclosed herein.\n\n\nAlternatively, another format can be used to measure the effect of SCD inhibition on sebaceous gland function. In a typical study using ridnets, oral, intravenous or topical formulations of the SCD inhibitor are administered to a rodent for a period of 1 to 8 days. Skin samples are taken and prepared for histological assessment to determine sebaceous gland number, size, or lipid content. A reduction of sebaceous gland size, number or function would indicate that the SCD inhibitor would have a beneficial impact on acne vulgaris, (Clark, S.B. et al. \"Pharmacological modulation of sebaceous gland activity: mechanisms and clinical applications\", Dermatol. Clin. (2007) Vol. 25, No. 2, pp 137-46. Geiger, J.M., \"Retinoids and sebaceous gland activity\" Dermatology (1995), Vol. 191, No. 4, pp 305-10).\n\n\nPHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS OF THE INVENTION AND ADMINISTRATION\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to pharmaceutical composition containing the compounds of the invention disclosed herein. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a composition comprising compounds of the invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and in an amount effective to modulate triglyceride level or to treat diseases related to dyslipidemia and disorders of lipid metabolism, when administered to an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human patient. In an embodiment of such composition, the patient has an elevated lipid level, such as elevated triglycerides or \n\n cholesterol, before administration of said compound of the invention and the compound of the invention is present in an amount effective to reduce said lipid level.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions useful herein also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, including any suitable diluent or excipient, which includes any pharmaceutical agent that does not itself induce the production of antibodies harmful to the individual receiving the composition, and which may be administered without undue toxicity. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, liquids, such as water, saline, glycerol and ethanol, and the like. A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, and other excipients is presented in REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES (Mack Pub. Co., NJ. current edition).\n\n\nThose skilled in the art know how to determine suitable doses of the compounds for use in treating the diseases and disorders contemplated herein.\n\n\nTherapeutic doses are generally identified through a dose ranging study in humans based on preliminary evidence derived from animal studies. Doses must be sufficient to result in a desired therapeutic benefit without causing unwanted side effects for the patient. The preferred dosage range for an animal is 0.001 mg/Kg to 10,000 mg/Kg, including 0.5 mg/Kg, 1.0 mg/Kg, 2.0 mg/Kg 5.0 mg/Kg and 10 mg/Kg, though doses outside this range may be acceptable. The dosing schedule may be once or twice per day, although more often or less often may be satisfactory.\n\n\nThose skilled in the art are also familiar with determining administration methods (oral, intravenous, inhalation, sub-cutaneous, transdermal, topical, etc.), dosage forms, suitable pharmaceutical excipients and other matters relevant to the delivery of the compounds to a subject in need thereof.\n\n\nIn an alternative use of the invention, the compounds of the invention can be used in in vitro or in vivo studies as exemplary agents for comparative purposes to find other compounds also useful in treatment of, or protection from, the various diseases disclosed herein.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are those suitable for enteral, such as oral or rectal, transdermal, topical, and parenteral administration to mammals, including man, to inhibit stearoyl-CoA desaturase, and for the treatment of \n\n conditions associated with stearoyl desaturase activity. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmacologically active compound of the instant invention, alone or in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.\n\n\nThe pharmacologically active compounds of the invention are useful in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount thereof in conjunction or admixture with excipients or carriers suitable for either enteral or parenteral application. For enteral or parenteral application, it is preferred to administer an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention as tablets or gelatin capsules. Such pharmaceutical compositions may comprise, for example, the active ingredient together with diluents (e.g., lactose, dextrose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, cellulose and/or glycine), lubricants (e.g., silica, talcum, stearic acid, its magnesium or calcium salt and/or polyethyleneglycol), and for tablets also comprises binders (e.g., magnesium aluminum silicate, starch paste, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone) and disintegrants (e.g., starches, agar, alginic acid or its sodium salt) or effervescent mixtures and absorbants, colorants, flavors and sweeteners.\n\n\nIn another aspect of the present invention the compounds may be in the form of injectable compositions, e.g. preferably aqueous isotonic solutions or suspensions, and suppositories, which can be advantageously prepared from fatty emulsions or suspensions. The compositions may be sterilized and/or contain adjuvants, such as preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers. In addition, they may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances. The compositions may be prepared according to conventional mixing, granulating or coating methods, respectively, and contain about 0.1- 75%, preferably about 1-50%, of the active ingredient.\n\n\nSuitable formulations for transdermal and topical application include a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention with carrier. Advantageous carriers include absorbable pharmacologically acceptable solvents to assist passage through the skin of the host. Characteristically, transdermal devices are in the form of a bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the compound \n\n optionally with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound of the skin of the host at a controlled and pre-determined rate over a prolonged period of time, and means to secure the device to the skin.\n\n\nThe most suitable route will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated. Those skilled in the art are also familiar with determining administration methods, dosage forms, suitable pharmaceutical excipients and other matters relevant to the delivery of the compounds to a subject in need thereof.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be usefully combined with one or more other therapeutic agents for the treatment of SCD-mediated diseases and conditions. Preferrably, the other therapeutic agent is selected from antidiabetics, hypolipidemic agents, anti-obesity agents, anti-hypertensive agents or inotropic agents.\n\n\nThus, an additional aspect of the present invention concerns a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents. For example, the composition can be formulated to comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention as defined above, in combination with another therapeutic agent, each at an effective therapeutic dose as reported in the art.

The homogenate is centrifuged at 10,400 x g for 20 min to eliminate mitochondria and cellular debris. The supernatant is filtered through a 3-layer cheesecloth and centrifuged at 105,000 x g for 60 min.

Description\n\n\n\n\n SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR MEASURING TRANSLATION ACTIVITY IN VIABLE CELLS\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to translation systems and methods for measuring translation activity. In particular, the present invention relates to real-time measurement of general ribosomal activity in viable cells and organelles.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The process of protein synthesis\n\n\nProtein synthesis is one of the most central life processes. A protein is formed by the linkage of multiple amino acids via peptide bonds, according to a sequence defined by the template messenger RNA (mRNA). Protein synthesis occurs in the ribosomes, the protein manufacturing plants of every organism and nearly every cell type.\n\n\nRibosomes are ribonucleoprotein particles consisting of a small and large subunit. In bacteria these subunits have sedimentation coefficients of 30 and 50, and thus are referred to as \"30S\" and \"50S\" respectively; in eukaryotes the sedimentation coefficients are 40 and 60. The translation system makes use of a large number of components, including inter alia the ribosome, initiation, elongation, termination and recycling factors, transfer RNA, amino acids, aminoacyl synthetases, magnesium, and the product polypeptides. tRNAs are 73-93 nucleoside RNA molecules that recruit amino acid residues to the protein synthesis machinery. The structure of tRNA is often depicted as a cloverleaf representation. Structural elements of a typical tRNA include an acceptor stem, a D- loop, an anticodon loop, a variable loop and a TÏC loop. Aminoacylation, or charging, of tRNA results in linking the carboxyl terminal of an amino acid to the 2'-(or 3'-) hydroxyl group of a terminal adenosine base via an ester linkage. Aminoacylation occurs in two steps, amino acid activation (i.e. adenylation of the amino acid to produce \n\n aminoacyl-AMP), tRNA aminoacylation (i.e. attachment of an amino acid to the tRNA).\n\n\nProtein translation, also referred to as \"polypeptide synthesis,\" begins by formation of the initiation complex, composed of the two ribosomal subunits, proteins known as \"initiation factors,\" mRNA, and an initiator tRNA, which recognizes the base sequence UAG, i.e. the initiator codon of open reading frames. Initiation factors are proteins whose function is to bring the mRNA and initiator tRNA to the ribosome. The initiation factors first bind to the small ribosome subunit, then to the initiator tRNA, and then the large ribosomal subunit is recruited. Elongation proceeds with repeated cycles of charged tRNAs binding to the ribosome (a step termed \"recognition\"), peptide bond formation, and translocation. Elongation factors recruit and assist with binding of additional tRNAs and in elongation of the polypeptide chain. Elongation utilizes enzymes such as peptidyl transferase, which catalyzes addition of amino acid moieties onto the growing chain. Termination factors recognize a stop signal, such as the base sequence UGA, in the mRNA, terminating polypeptide synthesis and releasing the polypeptide chain and mRNA from the ribosome (Kapp et al., 2004, Annu Rev Biochem. 73:657-704). After termination of translation, the recycling factor enables the ribosome to dissociate into its two separate subunits, which are then available for a new round of protein synthesis. In eukaryotes, ribosomes are often attached to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments. Additionally, ribosomes are active in organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria and, in plant cells, in chloroplasts, and other subcellular compartments. One important locus of protein synthesis activity is the dendritic spines of neurons. Ribosomes as targets of drugs and antibiotic compounds\n\n\nThere are variations between eukaryotic and prokaryotic translation mechanisms, as well as subtler differences between eukaryotic ribosomes in different organisms and subcellular components. Prokaryotic ribosomes are the targets of many antibiotic compounds (Yonath, Annu Rev Biochem. 74:649-79, 2005; Hainrichson M et al, Designer aminoglycosides: the race to develop improved antibiotics and compounds for the treatment of human genetic diseases. Org Biomol Chem 6(2):227-39, 2008). Such antibiotics must not exhibit significant inhibition of eukaryotic ribosomes, including \n\n mitochondrial ribosomes, and thus may exploit subtle differences between prokaryotic vs. mammalian and mitochondrial ribosomes. Widespread use of antibiotics over the past half-century has lead to emergence of bacterial strains resistant to many antibiotics now in use. For these reasons, fast and accurate measurement of ribosomal activity is important for development of new types of antibiotics, including activity of mitochondrial ribosomes in the context of an intact eukaryotic cell, in order to produce new antibiotics to combat the increasing number of the antibiotic-resistant strains (Cohen, 1992, Science, 257: 1050-1055). Use of these assays may lead to the discovery of new classes of antibiotics that are toxic to a broad range of pathogenic bacteria, and at the same time, harmless to their mammalian hosts.\n\n\nDiseases related to protein translation\n\n\nControl of protein translation is implicated in a large number of diseases. For example, a family of central nervous system (CNS) disorders connected with protein synthesis disturbances in neural spines is currently the subject of intense research. The family includes fragile X mental retardation, autism, aging and memory degeneration disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Neural spines and synapses contain their own protein synthesis machinery. Synaptic plasticity, underpinning the most basic neural functions of memory and learning, is dependent upon proper regulation of spinal protein synthesis. Memory and aging are hypothesized to be linked to this phenomenon; fragile-X mental retardation and autism are known to be.\n\n\nFragile-X syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation in humans. Conditions associated with the syndrome include mild to moderate cognitive abnormalities and behavioral disorders similar to autism, attention deficit disorder, obsessive-compulsive tendencies, hyperactivity, slow development of motor skills, and anxiety/fear disorder. Fragile X syndrome results from a deficiency of the fragile X mental retardation protein, FMRP, which is encoded by the X-linked FMRl gene, usually due to transcriptional silencing of this gene brought about by the expansion and hypermethylation of a (CGG)\nn\n trinucleotide repeat in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the gene, indicating that the necessity of FMRP for higher cognitive function. In the cytoplasm, FMRP-mRNP is normally associated with translating polyribosomes. In \n\n dendrites, FMRP is believed to modulate translation of mRNAs and acts as a translational suppressor.\n\n\nAnother important family of diseases directly connected to protein synthesis includes genetic disorders associated with the presence of premature termination codons (PTC) in the coding sequence of a critical protein, preventing its translation. Such diseases include Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and a large family of congenital diseases. A small molecule known as PTC124 (Welch EM et al, Nature 2007 May 3; 447(7140):87- 91) helps the ribosome slide over the mutated codon, thereby producing the required protein, albeit at only at 1-5% of normal concentrations. These amounts are often sufficient to sustain the life of an afflicted individual. PTC suppression has also been achieved by introducing charged suppressor tRNA into a living cell, enabling readthrough suppression of the PTC-containing mRNA and accumulation of the encoded protein (Sako et al, Nucleic Acids Symp Ser, 50:239-240, 2006.\n\n\nOther diseases believed to be connected to control of protein synthesis include cardiac hypertrophy, restenosis, diabetes and obesity. Inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) is associated with increased whole-body protein turnover. Reduced translational activity in cells, tissues, organs and organisms is a widely observed age-associated biochemical change. The consequences of slower rates of protein synthesis are manifold in the context of aging and age-related pathology. These include decreased availability of enzymes, inefficient removal of intracellular damaged substances, inefficient intra- and intercellular communication, decreased production of hormones and growth factors, decreased production of antibodies, and altered nature of the extracellular matrix.\n\n\nIn addition, control of protein synthesis is often compromised by cellular transformation. Novel anticancer drugs capable of targeting the ribosome in cancer cells are currently being developed (Palakurthi, S. S. et al., Cancer Research 61 : 6213-6218, 2001).\n\n\nMitochondria-related diseases\n\n\nMitochondria found in eukaryotic cells have transcription and translation systems for expression of the endogenous mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that use a genetic code different from the universal code used by nuclear genomic DNA. Most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA that is transcribed, translated in the cytosol, and \n\n imported into the mitochondria. However, some mitochondrial proteins are transcribed from mtDNA and translated within the organelle itself, using the mitochondrial system that includes two ribosomal RNA and 22 tRNAs. The human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) consists of 37 genes (Wallace, Gene. 354:169-80, 2005). The mitochondrial DNA encodes proteins that are essential components of the mitochondrial energy generation pathway, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Oxidative phosphorylation generates heat to maintain body temperature and ATP to power cellular metabolism. Mitochondria also produce a significant fraction of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and can initiate apoptosis through activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP) in response to energy deficiency and oxidative damage. Mitochondrial ROS cause mutation of mtDNA, which has been associated with a wide range of age-related diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiomyopathy, metabolic diseases such as diabetes, and various cancers.\n\n\nFRET, quenching pairs, and FCS Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a method widely used to monitor biological interactions. FRET utilizes a donor fluorophore, having an emission spectrum that overlaps with the excitation spectrum of the acceptor fluorophore. Only when the donor fluorophore and acceptor fluorophore are in close proximity, typically about 10 run, is a signal emitted from the acceptor fluorophore. FRET is described in Szollosi J, Damjanovich S, Matyus L, Application of fluorescence resonance energy transfer in the clinical laboratory: routine and research, Cytometry 34(4): 159-79, 1998. A quenching pair is a fluorophore in combination with a second molecule that quenches fluorescence of the fluorophore when in close proximity thereto. Thus, when the quenching pair is separated, under conditions wherein the fluorophore emits radiation, a signal is emitted.\n\n\nFluorescent Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) is described for example in Schwille et al., Biophysical Journal, Vol. 77, 1999: 2251-2265; Wiseman and Petersen, Biophysical Journal, Vol. 76, 1999: 963-977; and Thompson et al., Current Opinion in Structural Biology, 2002, 12:634-641. In this method, signal variation is measured and used for computing basic parameters of the system, such as the number of fluorescing molecules in the system. The variability is mainly a function of molecules entering and leaving the illuminated volume. \n\n Existing methods of measuring protein translation\n\n\nMethods current used in the art typically comprise radioactive labeling of amino acid residues, following by electrophoretic separation of the protein mixture and detection of radioactive label. Such methods produce an estimation of the total production of proteins over a given period of time measured in minute, hours or days, as opposed to the instant readout of methods of the present invention. Current methods do not provide real-time measurements of the ribosomal activity, nor can they identify subcellular localization of protein synthesis or measure the dynamics of this activity.\n\n\nU.S. Patent No. 6,210,941 discloses methods for the non-radioactive labeling, detection, quantitation and isolation of nascent proteins translated in a cellular or cell-free translation system. tRNA molecules are mis-aminoacylated with non-radioactive markers that may be non-native amino acids, amino acid analogs or derivatives, or substances recognized by the protein synthesizing machinery. These methods require elaborate and expensive cell preparations and equipment to enable isolation of nascent proteins, and are not suitable as a simple tool for measuring general protein synthesis rates in live cells or organelles, particularly in real time.\n\n\nU.S. Patent application Nos. 2003/0219783 and 2004/0023256 of Puglisi disclose compositions and methods for solid surface translation, where translationally competent ribosome complexes are immobilized on a solid surface. The ribosomes may be labeled to permit analysis of single molecules for determination of ribosomal conformational changes and translation kinetics. One or more components of the ribosome complex may be labeled at specific positions, and arrays of ribosome complexes may comprise a panel of different labels and positions of labels. Monitoring may comprise co- localization of fluorescently-labeled tRNA with fluorescently-labeled ribosomes or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a labeled ribosome and separately labeled mRNA. However, only cell-free translation methods are disclosed; methods for measuring overall cellular translation activity, in real time in viable cells or organelles, are neither disclosed nor suggested.\n\n\nWO2004/050825 of the inventor of the present invention discloses methods for monitoring the synthesis of proteins by ribosomes in cells or a cell-free translation system. WO2005/116252 of the inventor of the present invention discloses methods for identifying proteins synthesized in a cell-free translation system. According to the \n\n methods described in these applications, the ribosome is engineered to carry a donor fluorophore, and tRNA, amino acids, and/or another component of the ribosome act as a fluorophore acceptor, via either their natural fluorescent properties or introduction of an engineered acceptor fluorophore. Illumination of ribosomes by a light source during translation excites the donor fluorophores and thereby the acceptor fluorophores whenever these are in sufficient proximity to a donor. One or a small number of ribosomes are typically analyzed in one batch. Neither of these references discloses or suggests the methods of the present invention for measuring overall cellular translation activity, in real time in viable cells or organelles. There is an ongoing need for methods that provide a measure of overall cellular translation activity, in real time and in viable cells. Methods for measuring changes in protein synthesis rates in response to a drug candidate will be very useful for drug screening and assays for predicting therapeutic activity of candidate drugs. Also highly advantageous would be real-time measurement of ribosomal activity at sub-cellular resolution. The present invention overcomes problems and disadvantages associated with current strategies and provides methods for labeling, detection, and quantitation of general translation activity in real time.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides system and methods for measuring protein translation and methods for real time measurements of overall ribosomal activity in viable cells and subcellular compartments and organelles.

In this regard, no attempt is made to show structural details of the invention in more detail than is necessary for a fundamental understanding of the invention, the description taken with the figures making apparent to those skilled in the art how the several forms of the invention may be embodied in practice. \n\n FIGURE 1 is a schematic presentation of a bacterial ribosome structure with the large (50S) subunit 20, small (30S) subunit 25, aminoacyl (A) site 50 where the tRNAs are initially docked, peptidyl (P) site 51 where the growing polypeptide chain is docked, and exit (E) site 52 wherefrom the deacylated tRNA is removed once the cycle is complete. On the right side, tRNAs that are still undocked, i.e. 40, 41, 42 and 43, are depicted. These are charged (ellipse at the top, 32, 33, 40-43) or uncharged (34); and are either not labeled (40, 43), or labeled with donor (33,34,42) or with acceptor (32, 41).

The methods of the present invention can identify active ribosomes, at subcellular resolution, and provide a signal indicating the overall rate of any of the steps of protein synthesis, such as initiation, elongation, termination and recycling, as well as additional steps including recycling, subunit assembly, amino-acid charging onto tRNA, etc.\n\n\nThe present invention can be utilized to obtain a value for overall protein synthesis rather than individual protein identification. For analysis of individual cells and identification of the sequence of individual proteins in individual cells, other methods can be applied. According to one aspect, the present invention provides an apparatus for measuring protein translation, comprising a cell, wherein the cell comprises at least one protein synthesis element, the protein synthesis element being labeled with at least one marker, wherein the marker is capable of providing a electromagnetic detectable signal in response to overall translation activity in the cell. In another embodiment, a plurality of cells comprising the labeled protein synthesis element is utilized in the apparatus. In another embodiment, the apparatus further comprises instructions for use thereof in measuring or monitoring protein translation in an intact cell. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.\n\n\nAccording to the present invention, the protein synthesis element is any macromolecule or molecular complex that may be involved in any of the phases of ribosomal protein synthesis. Such elements include, but not limited to, a ribosomal protein, ribosome, \n\n ribosomal subunit, rRNA, tRNA, animoacyl synthetase, translation factor, amino acid and guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The protein synthesis element may further refer to ternary complexes comprising protein synthesis elements, such as, GTP-tRNA, elongation factor and the like. In another embodiment, the present invention provides an apparatus for measuring protein translation, comprising a subcellular compartment, wherein the subcellular compartment comprises at least one protein synthesis element, the protein synthesis element being labeled with at least one marker, wherein the marker is capable of providing a detectable electromagnetic signal in response to overall translation activity in the subcellular compartment. In another embodiment, a plurality of subcellular compartments comprising the labeled protein synthesis element is utilized in the apparatus. In another embodiment, the apparatus further comprises instructions for use thereof in measuring or monitoring protein translation in a cellular organelle. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for measuring translation activity, comprising the steps of:\n\n\n(i) introducing into cultured cells at least one protein synthesis element, wherein the protein synthesis element is labeled with at least one marker detectable through detection of electromagnetic radiation, wherein the marker is capable of emitting electromagnetic radiation in response to translation activity in the cells or subcellular compartments; and\n\n\n(ii) measuring electromagnetic radiation signals obtained in response to translation activity. In another embodiment, the method further comprises the step of analyzing said signals, thereby obtaining an estimate of translation activity. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for measuring translation activity, comprising the steps of:\n\n\n(i) introducing into a preparation of a subcellular compartment at least one protein synthesis element, wherein the protein synthesis element is labeled with at least one marker detectable through detection of electromagnetic radiation, wherein the marker is \n\n capable of emitting electromagnetic radiation in response to translation activity in the cells or subcellular compartments; and\n\n\n(ii) measuring electromagnetic radiation signals obtained in response to translation activity. In another embodiment, the method further comprises the step of analyzing said signals, thereby obtaining an estimate of translation activity. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, once electromagnetic radiation of the required wavelength and energy has been administered to the biological sample, thereby exciting the donor fluorophores, an optical apparatus monitors fluorescence emanating from the cellular translation system. The acceptor fluorophores on the tRNAs and/or amino acids and/or on the translation factors respond to this energy with the FRET signal whenever a donor and acceptor pair are in sufficient proximity, indicative of particular steps of translation activity. Fluorescent radiation emitted from acceptor fluorophores is detected by the optical apparatus and the event is recorded by the image acquisition device. \"Detectable signal\" as used herein refers to a signal able to be detected, over the background level, by standard means of detecting electromagnetic radiation. Means of detecting electromagnetic radiation are well known in the art. In some preferred embodiments, the signal is detected using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIR-FM) \"TIR-FM\" as used herein refers to a microscopy illumination method that illuminates a very small volume at the interface of two materials with different refractive indices. TIR-FM is described in WO 05/116252 and in US patent applications 2004/0023256 and 2006/0228708, which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.\n\n\nAdditional means of detecting electromagnetic radiation include image acquisition devices; confocal laser scanning microscopes (LSM), used to improve fluorescence image quality by eliminating out-of-focus fluorescence; and spinning disk confocal microscopes, which can include video rate (typically 30 frames per second) imaging with charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras and imaging of 3 -dimensional structures in live cells on a subsecond time scale with reduced photobleaching/phototoxicity (Graf et al, Live cell spinning disk microscopy. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 95: 57-75,\n\n\n2005). Programmable array microscopes (Hanley et al, An optical sectioning programmable array microscope implemented with a digital micromirror device, J \n\n Microsc 196: 317-331, 1999) and line scanning microscopes are available and offer similar advantages to spinning-disk confocals. In addition, multi-photon microscopes use infrared light, which readily penetrates up to 600 Î¼m, allowing deep tissue imaging in living animals (Helmchen and Denk, Deep tissue two-photon microscopy. Nat Methods 2: 932-940, 2005). Additional methods are described inter alia in WO 2007/002758, WO 2008/028298, European Patent EP1428016, and US Patent 7015486 and US Patent application 2005/0157294, which are incorporated herein by reference. Each method represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"FRET\" (\"fluorescence resonance energy transfer\") refers to physical phenomenon involving a donor fluorophore and a matching acceptor fluorophore selected so that the emission spectrum of the donor overlaps the excitation spectrum of the acceptor. When donor and acceptor are in close proximity (usually less than 10 nm), excitation of the donor will cause excitation of and emission from the acceptor, as some of the energy passes from donor to acceptor via a quantum coupling effect. Thus, a FRET signal serves as a proximity gauge of the donor and acceptor; only when they are within close proximity is a signal generated.\n\n\nAccording to one embodiment, the translation apparatus is placed in a test-tube and manually observed. In another embodiment, the apparatus is placed in a multi-well plate such as a 96 or 384 well plate and observed by a high-throughput fluorimetry instrument.\n\n\nAccording to another embodiment, the translation apparatus is placed under a microscope suitable for observing fluorescence at cellular or subcellular resolution, such as instruments available from Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) and Leica (Wetzlar, Germany), with an image acquisition device operable at a sufficient rate (10-100 frames per second) and computational units that can acquire and analyze the resulting images and data.\n\n\nAccording to another embodiment, the cellular translation apparatus is measured with the technique of anisotropy microscope. Fluorescence anisotropy can distinguish between populations of immobilized fluorophores and freely diffusing (and rotating) fluorophores. The technique can also measure the relative abundance of such populations. \n\n Assessing cellular translation activity can be accomplished in a variety of ways according to methods of the present invention. In one embodiment, a well of a 96 well plate or other commercially available multi-well plate is used to contain the biological sample. In another embodiment, the receptacle is the reaction vessel of a FACS machine. Other receptacles useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to 384 well plates. Still other receptacles useful in the present invention will be apparent to the skilled artisan to facilitate rapid high-throughput screening.\n\n\nOverview of one exemplary embodiment of the present invention\n\n\nOne or more moieties of tRNA, amino acid, or translation factor, or a plurality thereof, is engineered to carry a donor fluorophore and utilized as a donor, and another component of the protein translation machinery, or a plurality thereof, is engineered to carry an acceptor fluorophore and utilized as an acceptor. The other component may be similar to, different from, or identical to, the first moiety. The labeled tRNA(s), amino acid(s), translation factor(s) or other labeled components are introduced into cultured cells or subcellular compartments. In order to monitor translation, a light source illuminates the cells, thus exciting the donor fluorophores and thereby the acceptor fiuorophores whenever these components are in sufficient proximity to each other, generating a measurable signal.\n\n\nIf the labeled FRET pair, during the process of translation, are brought into close proximity, namely within 10 nm, a FRET signal is observed. When they are separated, the signal ceases. Thus, the level of FRET signals emitted from this pair indicates translation activity. The measurement can be the intensity of the signal or any other relevant feature, such as signal variability, signal polarity, signal lifetime, wavelength, photon number, spectrum, etc. as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art of fluorescent labeling and measurements.\n\n\nOne exemplary measurement measures the variability of the emitted signal. From this variability, it is easy to deduce the number of on/off events in the sample being measured. This is similar to measurements performed in Fluorescent Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS). In these applications, signal variation is measured and used for computing basic parameters of the apparatus, such as the number of fluorescing molecules in the apparatus. In FCS, the variability is mainly a function of molecules entering and leaving the illuminated volume. In an exemplary embodiment of the \n\n present invention, the variation is mainly caused by \"blinking\" (turning on and off) of the signals in response to protein translation activity. Thus, the translation activity being detected is evaluated from the ratio of variation to average signal intensity. Consequently, a signal that does not vary, e.g., in the event that the signal is constantly ON, is interpreted as lack of translation activity.\n\n\nTo compute the number of events, a person skilled in the art can use any suitable method known in the art, including, but not limited to, a method where the signal is measured over a period of time (preferably measured in seconds), and the autocorrelation is computed as follows:\n\n\nÎ£/\n2\n â ^\n2\n where I\nt\n is the signal strength at time t, and Î´l\nÎº\n is the signal deviation at time t (signal - average signal). In this way of measuring signal variations (with the accepted assumption that blinking follows a Poisson/Gaussian distribution), an estimate can be obtained on the event rate in the observed volume. Introduction of tRNA and nucleic acid molecules into a target cell\n\n\nAccording to one embodiment of the present invention, labeled tRNAs are introduced into intact cells. This can be accomplished through a variety of methods that have been previously established such as encapsulation of tRNA into liposomes or vesicles capable of fusion with cells. Fusion introduces the liposome or vesicle interior solution containing the tRNA into the cell. Alternatively, some cells will actively incorporate liposomes into their interior cytoplasm through endocytosis. The labeled tRNAs can also be introduced through the process of cationic detergent mediated lipofection (Feigner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:7413-17, 1987), or injected into large cells such as oocytes. Additional methods for introduction of tRNA into a target cell are well known in the art. Such methods include the use of RNAiFectâ¢ from Qiagen of Valencia, CA (Sako et al ibid) and electroporation. According to Sako et al, transfection of tRNA molecules, engineered to carry an anticodon for one of the natural stop codons (CUA, UUA, UCA) into A549 cells using the transfection agent RNAiFectâ¢ (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) is shown. The engineered tRNA were properly transfected and proved functional in a \n\n luciferase assay, where the luciferase gene included stop codons UGA, UAA, or UAG in place of the native Serl70 codon.\n\n\nAdditional methods for the introduction of nucleic acid molecules are described in Akhtar et al., (Trends Cell Bio. 2, 139, 1992). WO 94/02595 describes general methods for introduction of enzymatic RNA molecules. These protocols can be utilized for the introduction of virtually any nucleic acid molecule. Nucleic acid molecules can be administered to cells by a variety of methods known to those familiar to the art, including, but not restricted to, encapsulation in liposomes (WO03057164, Malone, R. W. et al., 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 86: 6077- 6081; Glenn, J. S. et al., 1993, Methods Enzymol. 221 : 327-339; Lu, D. et al., 1994, Cancer Gene Ther. 1: 245-252), by microinjection (Liu et al., 2005, Dev Growth Differ. 47(5):323- 31), by iontophoresis (Sakamoto et al., 2004, Gene Ther. 11(3):317-24), or by incorporation into other vehicles, such as hydrogels, cyclodextrins, biodegradable nanocapsules, and bioadhesive microspheres. In another embodiment, INTERFERinâ¢ (Autogen Bioclearâ¢, Wiltshire, UK) is used for tRNA transfection. INTERFERinâ¢ has been successfully used for tRNA transfection\n\n\nU.S. Patent Application No. 2004/235175 discloses a method of inserting RNA into cells. In this method, cells are transfected with RNA using electroporation in order to achieve high transfection efficiency.\n\n\nIn another, non-limiting exemplary electroporation protocol, 3-40 x 10\n6\n cells, preferably growing at log phase, are harvested, counted and washed with cold Ix HeBS (Hepes- buffered saline). Cells are resuspended in 0.8 mL Ix HeBS containing the tRNA and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. An exemplary recipe for HeBS is 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0-7.4. The tRNA /cell suspension is transferred to an electroporation cuvette and electroporated at an appropriate voltage, preferably at between 500-2000 Î¼F capacitance. The time constant is recorded if desired, and the mixture is optionally incubated in the cuvette for about 10 minutes at room temperature, prior to returning the cells to culture media. In another, non-limiting exemplary electroporation protocol successfully used for CHO- Kl cells, HEK cells, and rat hippocampal neurons (thus having utility for a large variety of cell types), tRNA is precipitated (either alone or as a coprecipitate with DNA) in \n\n ethanol and ammonium acetate at -20Â°C for at least 1 hour. The precipitated tRNA is pelleted, vacuum dried, and resuspended in CO\n2\n-independent medium to the desired final concentration (4 Î¼g/Î¼l tRNA, either with our without 2.5 Î¼g/Î¼l carrier DNA, is typically appropriate). Immediately prior to electroporation, the media is replaced with CO\n2\n-independent media, containing no glutamine, FBS or antibiotics. CO\n2\n-independent media are available e.g. from Invitrogen-Gibco and include phenol red free media, Liebovitz's L15 Media (catalogue no. 11415-114), and catalogue nos. 18055-088; 18045-088, and 041-95180M. Approximately 5 Î¼l of electroporation solution is added to the cells, followed by electrical pulse application. For CHO-Kl cells and HEK cells, four 120 V pulses of 50 ms duration are typically used, and for neurons, four 160 V pulses of 25 ms duration. The CO\n2\n-independent media is immediately replaced with fresh Ham's F 12 media for CHOKl cells, DMEM for HEK cells, or neurobasal media for neurons, and cells are returned to the 37Â°C incubator.\n\n\nIn another, non-limiting exemplary electroporation protocol, electrolyte-filled fused silica capillaries (30 cm long, 30-Î¼m id., 375-Î¼m od) are used. The outlet end of the capillaries is tapered to an approximate outer tip diameter (typically 50 Î¼m, depending on the size of the cell type used). Exemplary electrolytes useful in this method are those based on HEPES buffer. The tapered outlet end of the capillary is submerged in the buffer contained in the cell chamber, and the inlet end is placed in a buffer-filled vial. Both the capillary and the inlet vial buffer solutions contain the tRNA and/or any other components to be transfected. Cells are placed in a chamber on the microscope stage, and cell bathing medium (HEPES buffer) is electrically grounded. The capillary outlet is placed within 5 Î¼m of the cell surface, and the DC high voltage power supply is connected. In another, non-limiting exemplary electroporation protocol, cells are electroporated using a modified patch-clamp technique. Single cells under direct observation are indented with a microelectrode and electroporated using a current delivered from a simple voltage-clamp circuit, as described in detail in Rae JL and Levis RA, Single-cell electroporation, Pflugers Arch 443(4):664-70, 2002. In another, non-limiting exemplary electroporation protocol successfully used for electroporation of DNA, but equally useful for tRNA, into individual neurons in cultures of organotypic brain slices (Figure 4), micropipettes with a tip diameter of \n\n about 1-2 Î¼m and with resistances of 10-20 MÎ© are pulled from capillary glass with filament (available from Science Products, Hofheim, Germany, catalogue number GB150F-8P) on a Micropipette Puller (available from Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, USA catalogue number P-97). Micropipettes are mounted on a three-axis micromanipulator (Luigs and Neumann, Ratingen, Germany). A Millicell CM insert (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) containing a brain slice is placed in a perfusion chamber on the stage of a Zeiss Axioplanâ¢ microscope and continuously perfused with oxygenated physiological salt solution during electroporation. The overall time under perfusion is typically about 30 min. Slices are transferred back into the incubator, individual cell somata are identified, and a pipette tip is gently placed against the cell membrane. Voltage pulses are delivered between an electrode placed inside the micropipette in contact with the tRNA solution (cathode), and a ground electrode (anode) using an isolated voltage stimulator (available from WPI, Berlin, Germany, under the name HI-MED HG-203) controlled by a tetanizer (available from Sigmann Elektronik, Hueffenbart, Germany). To prevent the tip from clogging and dilution of the tRNA, a back-pressure (typically 2-10 mbar) is applied to the pipette. In an exemplary embodiment, a single train of 200 square pulses with a duration of 1 ms is applied, using a 4 ms delay with an amplitude of 10 V. The 1 ms pulses remove the negatively charged tRNA from the pipette by electrophoresis, driving electroporation. Typically, no voltage is applied during the delay of 4 ms between the pulses and thus there is no current flowing through the circuit.\n\n\nEach method for introduction of tRNA or nucleic acid into a cell represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.\n\n\nIntroduction of Nucleic Acid Molecules into Subcellular Compartments Vestweber and Schatz (Nature 338: 170-172, 1989) achieved uptake of both single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides into yeast mitochondria by coupling the 5' end of the oligonucleotide to a precursor protein consisting of the yeast cytochrome c oxidase subunit. Seibel et al. (Nucleic Acids Research 23: 10-17, 1995) reported the import into the mitochondrial matrix of double-stranded DNA molecules conjugated to the amino- terminal leader peptide of the rat ornithine-transcarbamylase.\n\n\nMethods for the introduction of nucleic acid molecules into the interior of an organelle are disclosed in WO2003/052067. WO2005/001062 discloses the use of viral vectors \n\n that contain localization signals specific for the target organelle. These protocols can be utilized for the introduction of labeled tRNAs or some other part of the ribosome into the mitochondria or chloroplast.\n\n\nLabeling and detection according to the present invention In other embodiments, methods of the invention can be carried out in accordance with the following alternatives:\n\n\nRibosomal labeling. In this embodiment the donor and/or acceptor fluorophore or fluorophores are attached to the ribosome large subunit and/or small subunit by using fluorescent oligonucleotide DNA probes (Figure 2) as discussed in detail in Amann et al., Microbiological Reviews, 59:143-169, 1995; Fuchs et al, Appl Environ Microbiol 67: 961-968, 2001; Behrens et al, Appl Environ Microbiol 69:4935-4941, 2003), which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nAccording to one embodiment, a FRET pair of fluorescent oligonucleotide DNA probes is used to estimate the abundance of assembled ribosomes. According to another embodiment a quench pair of ribosome large subunit and/or small subunit is used to estimate the abundance of disassembled ribosomes. According to another embodiment, the ratio of assembled ribosomes is detected by the measurement of both said FRET and quench pairs. \"Quenching pair\" and \"quench pair\" as used herein refer to a fluorophore in combination with a second molecule that quenches fluorescence of the fluorophore when in close proximity thereto. Thus, when the quenching pair is separated, under conditions wherein the fluorophore emits radiation, a detectable signal can be emitted.\n\n\nProbe pairs that can attach to accessible parts of the assembled ribosome and have a distance compatible with the requirements of FRET are presented in Table 1 (TT denotes Thermus Thermofilus, EC denotes E. CoIi). Table 1: Oligonucleotide probe pairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabeling for estimation of ribosomal subunit assembly. According to another embodiment, the large and small ribosomal subunits are labeled with a FRET pair, wherein the obtained signal is proportional to the abundance of assembled ribosomes. According to another embodiment, the large and small ribosomal subunits are labeled with a donor/quencher pair, wherein the obtained signal is proportional to the abundance of dissociated ribosomes. According to a further embodiment, the ribosome subunits are labeled with both a FRET pair and a donor/quencher pair, wherein the ratio of assembled to dissociated ribosomes is estimated.\n\n\nA list of ribosomal protein pairs suitable to be used as a FRET pair or as a donor/quencher pair is provided in Table 2. The data is compiled from the Thermus Thermophilus structure and therefore is relevant for most prokaryotes.\n\n\nTable 2: Ribosomal protein pairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRibosomal protein labeling. In this embodiment the donor and/or acceptor fluorphore or fluorophores are attached to the ribosomal proteins by fusing the protein of choice with a naturally fluorescent protein, such as green fluorescent protein, yellow/cyan/blue fluorescent proteins or any other naturally fluorescent protein. An example wherein Ll \n\n was labeled by fusion with a naturally fluorescent protein is described in Mascarenhas et al (EMBO Rep. 2 (8): 685-689, 2001), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nOrganic dyes can be used to label ribosomal proteins using standard protein labeling techniques. Suppliers of these dyes publish detailed protocols describing their use. General procedures label proteins through their amino groups (lysine). Other procedures target cysteines which are sometimes available for precisely located labeling. In this way, ribosomal proteins Sl and S8 were labeled by coumarin (Bakin et al, 1991, J MoI Biol. 221 (2): 441- 453), and ribosomal proteins were tagged with fluorescein attached to a cysteine residue (Odom et al., 1990, Biochemistry, 10734- 10744). tRNA labeling. In this embodiment the donor and/or acceptor fluorophore or fluorophores are attached to one or more species of tRNAs, or even total bulk tRNA that includes all tRNA moieties. Methods for fluorophore labeling of tRNA are well known in the art and are described inter alia in U.S. Patent 7,288,372 and U.S. Patent applications 2003/0219780 and 2003/0092031, which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nIn another exemplary method, used for Met-tRNA (Jun SY et al, Fluorescent labeling of cell-free synthesized proteins with fluorophore-conjugated methionylated tRNA derived from in vitro transcribed tRNA. J Microbiol Methods. 2008 Jun;73(3):247-51) but suitable for any tRNA, 10 Î¼l of 3OmM succinimidyl ester of fluorescent dye in dimethy sulfoxide (DMSO) is added to 40 Î¼l of the Met-tRNA-fMet-resuspended solution and incubated for 40 min on ice. The reaction is stopped by adding one-tenth volume of 2M sodium acetate, pH 5.0. Fluorophore-conjugated Met-tRNA-fMet is extracted repeatedly with an equal volume of acid phenol: chloroform (1 :1, v/v; pH 5.0. Two and a half volumes of cold 95% (v/v) ethanol solution are added to the aqueous phase, and the mixture is allowed to stand at -70 \n0\nC for 1 h to precipitate fluorophore-conjugated Met-tRNA-fMet. The precipitated pellet is collected by micro-centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 Â°C for 20min, and then resuspended in an equal volume of diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water to the original reaction volume. After alcohol precipitation, the precipitate is washed with 80% (v/v) ethanol solution, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in 20 Î¼l of DEPC-treated water. \n\n In another exemplary method, used for conjugation of BODIPY-FL to Met-tRNA (Olejnik J et al, N-terminal labeling of proteins using initiator tRNA. Methods. 2005 Jul;36(3):252-60), but suitable for conjugation of BODIPY-FL to any tRNA, 1.0 OD\n260\n (1500pmol) of methionyl-tRNA-fMet (tRNA-fMet [Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO], aminoacylated with methionine) is dissolved in water (37.5 Î¼l), followed by addition of 2.5 Î¼l of IN NaHCO\n3\n (final cone. 5OmM, pH 8.5), followed by 10 Î¼l of 1OmM BODIPYFL-SSE solution (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The modification reaction is allowed to proceed for lOmin at 0 Â°C and quenched by the addition of 0.1 volume of IM lysine. 0.1 volume of 3M NaOAc, pH 5.0, is added, and modified tRNA is precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol, dissolved in 50 Î¼l of water, and purified on a NAP-5 column (Amersham-Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) to remove any free fluorescent reagent.\n\n\nIn general, tRNA molecules can be tagged while retaining their interaction with the aminoacyl synthetases as well as retaining their functionality with the ribosome. tRNAs have been tagged with fluorescein (Watson et al., 1995, Biochemistry. 34 (24): 7904- 12), with tetra methyl rhodamine (TMR) (Jia et al.,. 1997, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 7932-6), and with proflavine and ethidium bromide.\n\n\nCertain preferred embodiments of the present invention include labeling the tRNA with small organic dyes attached to the \"shoulder\" region of the tRNA, such as in positions 8 and 47 of E. CoIi tRNAs, which have been often used for this purpose. One particular labeling method is attaching the label of choice to one or both of the dihydrouridines in the D-Loop of the tRNA. Most tRNA have these dihydrouridine modifications, enabling a wide choice of labels, including rhodamines, which are very useful due to their low tendency to bleach and high signal strength. The most widely used dyes are FITC and TMR (excitation peaks at 550 nm and emission at 573 nm).\n\n\nIn another embodiment of the present invention, a specific tRNA species or bulk tRNA (non-specific) is labeled with the donor fluorescent label. Other specific or non-specific tRNA are labeled with the acceptor fluorescent label. The labeled tRNA mixture is administered to the cells. FRET will occur only when neighboring sites in the ribosome (for example A and P, or P and E) are occupied by a donor-acceptor pair. For example, if 10% of all cellular tRNA is labeled, then on average approximately 1% of active ribosomes will be in a FRET configuration (.25% in each of PA, AP, PE, EP \n\n configurations, where A\n5\nP\n5\nE indicate the ribosomal tRNA sites, and donor is assumed always to be in the first and acceptor in the second site).\n\n\nAccording to another embodiment of the present invention, the ratio of immobilized tRNAs in adjacent ribosomal sites is detected by measurement of FRET resulting from interaction between the tRNAs with donor and acceptor fluorophores. When both the donor and the acceptor fluorophores are attached to one or more species of the tRNAs, an elongation activity is detected.\n\n\nAccording to another embodiment of the present invention, the ratio of immobilized tRNAs is detected by the measurement of tRNAs with single fluorophores, which produce the isotropic signal detected by anisotropy microscopy only when immobilized.\n\n\nAmino acid labeling. Methods of fluorescent labeling of amino acids are well known in the art and are disclosed in WO2004/050825, which is incorporated herein by reference. Fluorescent moieties useful as markers include dansyl fluorophores, coumarins and coumarin derivatives, fluorescent acridinium moieties and benzopyrene based fluorophores. Preferably, the fluorescent marker has a high quantum yield of fluorescence at a wavelength different from native amino acids. Upon excitation at a pre-selected wavelength, the marker is detectable at low concentrations either visually or using conventional fluorescence detection methods. According to the present invention, while both the donor and the acceptor fluorophores are attached to one or more amino acids, an elongation activity is detected.\n\n\nTranslation factor labeling. In another embodiment, the translation factor of the present invention is selected from the group consisting of a preinitiation factor, an initiation factor, an elongation factor, a termination factor, a recycling factor, an amino- acyl synthetase and a peptidyl transferase. In another embodiment, two components of the preinitiation or initiation complex are identified and labeled with donor and/or acceptor fluorphore or fluorophores. The detected FRET signal is proportional to abundance of assembled complexes.\n\n\nLabeling strategies for initiation factors. In prokaryotes, the process of translation initiation is well documented (Laursen et al., 2005, Microbiol MoI Biol Rev. 69(1): 101- 123). Briefly, binding of IF3 to the 3OS ribosomal subunit promotes dissociation of the ribosome into subunits and thus couples ribosome recycling and translation initiation. \n\n Initiation factor IFl binds specifically to the base of the A-site of the 3OS ribosomal subunit and is thought to direct the initiator tRNA to the ribosomal P-site by blocking the A-site. Following subunit dissociation, IF2, mRNA, and fMet-tRNA associate with the 30S ribosomal subunit. The three factors bind to the ribosome, and are brought together transiently. Thus, identification of immobilization of one of the three factors, or formation of a FRET pair, identifies an ongoing process of translation. This is in contrast with other assay strategies, for example immobilization of tRNA in a ribosome, which means that the A, P or E site is occupied, but does not necessarily mean that translation is in progress, as some antibiotics are known to \"freeze\" the ribosome with tRNA in place.\n\n\nWith this strategy, as with other strategies known in the art, including, but not limited to FCS, measurement of signal variability provides an estimate of the number of initiation events.\n\n\nSeveral strategies are possible for monitoring factor immobilization or co-binding. According to one embodiment, any one of the factors can be labeled and anisotropy microscopy is used to identify the binding event. In this embodiment, IFl is a prime candidate due to its small size (about 8KDa). According to another embodiment, another pair of components of the translation machinery is labeled as FRET pair, with the emission of a FRET signal indicative of the transient state of the machinery. Apparatuses for study of translation in subcellular compartments and uses thereof. Methods of the present invention enable monitoring of translation in various specific subcellular compartments such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, and dendritic spines. In mitochondria and chloroplasts, the entire translation apparatus, including ribosomes, ribosomal proteins, translation factors, tRNAs and the genetic code, are specific to the subcellular compartment and distinct from those of the host eukaryotic cell. Also, apart from the ribosomal RNA and tRNA, other proteins of the translation apparatus are synthesized in the cell cytoplasm and imported into the subcellular compartment. This allows a specific assay to be developed, wherein the proteins of choice are labeled in the cell, either by techniques of genetic engineering or by introducing the labeled proteins into the cells. In both cases, the labeled proteins are directed to and imported into the subcellular compartment. Thus the measured signals pertain to subcellular compartment only and not to the general cellular translation \n\n apparatus. This type of assay can be useful, for example, in the study of adverse effects of antibiotics, which are mainly to be expected in mitochondria due to the large similarity between mitochondrial ribosomes and those of microorganisms.\n\n\nHost Cells\n\n\nAny cell is suitable for assaying translation by methods of the present invention. Non- limiting examples of target cell types are COS, HEK-293, BHK, CHO, TM4, CVI, VERO-76, HELA, MDCK, BRL 3A, NIH/3T3 cells, etc. Additional cell lines are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and a wide variety of suitable cell lines are available from the American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209. Cells of particular interest include neuronal cells, immune system cells, including lymphocytes (B and T cells e.g., T helper cells) and leucocytes (e.g., granulocytes, lymphocytes, macrophage and monocytes), cells from lymph, spleen and bone marrow tissues, epithelial cells, and cells from or derived from internal organs.\n\n\nSignal Detection\n\n\nThe signals emitted by the cells or organelles as disclosed in the present invention can be detected by several different instrument configurations. As a bulk assay, it can potentially be read manually, by comparing the fluorescent signal to calibrated standards under a fluorescent reader. Alternatively, it can be read by a fluorescent plate reader, made for 96 well plates, 384 well plates, or any other configuration. In another embodiment, the labeled cells are imaged by a microscope, to identify subcellular localization of protein synthesis processes and to estimate the relative rates of protein synthesis in various regions of the cell. In further embodiments, instruments capable of single-molecule detection in live cells are used.\n\n\nSignal Analysis\n\n\nThere are numerous methods to process and analyze the resulting signals. In one embodiment, donor, acceptor and FRET signals are separately measured and compared to yield the fraction of pairs in FRET position versus the total concentration of donors and acceptors separately. When repeating such measurements with various \n\n concentrations of labeled components vs. the unlabeled, it is easy to derive the overall fraction of component pairs versus the total number of components. For example, if 10% of tRNA are labeled as donors and 10% as acceptors, then about 4% of active ribosomes will include a FRET tRNA pair in neighboring ribosomal positions (1% AP, 1% PA, 1% PE, 1% EP, where donor is always first and acceptor second). This creates a specific ratio of donor/acceptor/FRET signals. If only 5% are labeled as donors or acceptors, than only 1% FRET signal will occur. Thus the FRET signal strength is proportional to the square of the donor/acceptor signals. This allows a calibration curve to be derived, for example in cell-free system, and later used in live cells to provide a precise estimate of the relative concentration of components in FRET position as well as the concentration of all components. This analysis is identical in the case that the labels are applied to ribosomal subunits, to ribosome and initiation factor, or any other combination of two components of the protein translation system.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, signal variance is computed, and the square of the ratio of average signal to average variance is computed, which yields an estimation of the number of labeled components being measured. This assumes that the process underlying this variation is of Poissonian or Gaussian nature, such as in molecules diffusing into and out of a certain volume, or the blinking of labeled ribosomes in response to protein synthesis. When considering a sizable number of ribosomes (10 or more), the process can be assumed to be governed by Poissonian or Gaussian statistics, depending on the number. In such cases, as is well known, the variability of the signal is proportional to the square root of the signal strength. For example, let the measured signal be denoted by S\nt\n, and let its average over a period of time (for example a few seconds) be denoted by S\nav\n- The variance Var(S) = average(S\nt\n-S\nav\n). In such processes, the size of the variance is on average the square root of the signal. Thus Var(S)~sqrt(S\nav\n) = sqrt(NS) where S is the signal from a single event (for example FRET from a pair of labeled components). This means that (S/Var(S))\n2\n = NS/S = N or the number of active particles.\n\n\nFluorescence anisotropy Fluorescence anisotropy is based on the principle of photo-selective excitation of fluorophores by polarized light. In an isotropic solution, the fluorophores are oriented randomly. Excitation with polarized light results in a selective excitation of those \n\n fluorophore molecules whose absorption transition dipole is parallel to the electric vector of the excitation. This selective excitation results in a partially oriented population of polarized fluorescence emission. If the excited fluorophores are immobile, emission occurs with the light polarized along the same axis in which excitation occurred.\n\n\nHowever, for a molecule that undergoes rotational diffusion during the lifetime of the excited state, the emission will take place in a basically random direction, and polarization will be relatively random (this depends on the relationship between the lifetime of the fluorophore and the rate of rotation). Conveniently, rotation correlation times for macromolecules are on the order of nanoseconds. For example, the rotational correlation time for human serum albumen is around 50 ns. When a molecule (such as a fluorescent labeled tRNA) binds to a large complex such as the ribosome, it will have a longer rotational correlation time. This can be observed as a change in the anisotropy of the complex with respect to the unbound molecule.\n\n\nApplication of the present invention for diagnostic applications\n\n\nThe methods disclosed herein are suitable for diagnostic applications, wherein rates of protein synthesis are indicative of type or phase of a disease or condition. For the purpose of diagnosis, cells are obtained from the host, for example, from biopsy, and prepared for the assay. In another embodiment, the preparation comprises the following steps:\n\n\n(a) introducing the labeled translation system components into the by means of transfection; and\n\n\n(b) detecting radiation emitted from the cells. In another embodiment, the method further comprises the step of analyzing the radiation or a signal derived thereof, thereby obtaining a readout of translation activity.\n\n\nPrior to detection, cells are commonly transferred to a carrier. The type of carrier depends on the type of measurement that is used for detection. Thus, a carrier includes, but is not limited to, a fluorescent plate reader. \n\n In another embodiment, the above method is applied in a high-throughput operation. In another embodiment, the method is applicable for accurate measurements of subcellular localization of protein synthesis events, for example, detection of translation activity in mitochondria or neuronal spines. Application of the present invention for high throughput screening (HTS) assays\n\n\nThe methods disclosed herein can optionally be used for the screening of a large library of small molecules, recombinant proteins, peptides, antibodies, or other compounds to determine their efficacy or their potential for use as drugs, based on measuring the effect of a test compound on general translation in a test cell. High-throughput screening typically utilizes an assay that is compatible with the screening instrument, enables quick rejection of most of the compounds as irrelevant, and approves only a small fraction for continued research. The present invention is suitable for a very thorough and informative assay, as explained above, in the sense that it provides realtime measurement of general ribosomal activity in viable cells. Thus, functional activity of a compound on a specific cell type can be usefully studied by subjecting it to translation monitoring assay as disclosed herein. A cell line with tagged elements is cultured and placed in a multi well plate. This can have a 96 well plate format, a 384 well plate format or any other format compatible with automated screening. The wells in the plate need to be optically amenable for detection. A robot administers one compound from the library into each well, and signal detection is performed. A suitable sampling regime should be adopted. As an illustrative example a protein translation monitoring measurement for 30 seconds every 10 minutes for a total of one hour. Other regimes can optionally be also used. The effect of the compound on translation activity can thus be detected. It is understood by the skilled artisan that while various options (of compounds, properties selected or order of steps) are provided herein, the options are also each provided individually, and can each be individually segregated from the other options provided herein. Moreover, steps which are obvious and known in the art that will increase the sensitivity of the assay are intended to be within the scope of this invention. For example, there may be additional washing steps, blocking steps, etc. It is understood that the exemplary embodiments provided herein in no way serve to limit \n\n the true scope of this invention, but rather are presented for illustrative purposes. All references cited herein are expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nDetermination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)\n\n\nAccording to some embodiments of the present invention, the test cells are bacterial cells. As a secondary assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against bacterial organisms is determined for each test compound that is positive in the translation-screening assay. Methods known in the art may be used such as broth micro- dilution testing, using a range of concentrations of each test compound (1993, National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Methods for Dilution Anti-microbial Susceptibility Tests For Bacteria That Grow Aerobically-Third Edition: Approved\n\n\nStandard, M7-A3). The MIC against a variety of pathogens are determined using the same method. Pathogenic species to be tested generally include: E. coli, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus,\n\n\nKlebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermis, Shigella flexneri, and Salmonella typhimurium.\n\n\nDuring the evaluation of positive compounds of this embodiment and selection of leads for further development, the two main considerations will be antibacterial activity and chemical structure. To be considered for further development, a compound should inhibit preferably the growth of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. The chemical structure should preferably be amenable to further chemical modification, so that analogs and derivatives can be synthesized and analyzed for structure-activity relationship and other preclinical studies, such as toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and drug metabolism.\n\n\nDefinitions The term \"translation activity\" as used herein refers to any step during the transition from mRNA to an amino acid sequence, including, but not limited to, assembly of the initiation or pre-initiation complex, attachment of an mRNA to a ribosomal subunit, assembly of the entire ribosome particle, mRNA-tRNA recognition and pairing (also known as \"codon-anti codon paring\"), amino acid activation (i.e. adenylation of the amino acid to produce aminoacyl-AMP), tRNA aminoacylation (i.e. attachment of an amino acid to the tRNA), attachment of the recycling factor, and addition of the amino \n\n acid to a growing polypeptide chain. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.\n\n\nThe term \"translation factor\" refers to any one or more factors involved in protein translation, including, but not limited to, preinitiation factor, initiation factor, elongation factor, termination factor, recycling factor, amino-acyl synthetase and peptidyl transferase.\n\n\nThe term \"mRNA\" is used herein to describe a ribonucleotide sequence that transfers genetic information to ribosomes, where it serves as a template for protein synthesis. Ribonucleotide sequences are polymers of ribonucleic acids, and are constituents of all living cells and many viruses. They consist of a long, usually single-stranded chain of alternating phosphate and ribose units with the bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil bonded to the ribose. The structure and base sequence of RNA are determinants of protein synthesis and the transmission of genetic information.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"tRNA\" refers to transfer ribonucleic acid. An \"initiator tRNA\" is a specific tRNA molecule that is used only for the initial amino acid of a synthesized polypeptide. A \"suppressor tRNA\" is a tRNA molecule that comprises an anticodon which allows pairing with a termination codon (e.g. UAG and UAA). An\n\n\n\"elongator tRNA\" is a tRNA molecule that is neither an initiator nor a suppressor, and that places its corresponding amino acid or codon in its proper sequence during the process of translation.\n\n\nAs used herein, \"cell\" refers to a prokaryotic or a eukaryotic cell. Suitable cells can be, for example, of mammalian, avian, insect, bacterial, yeast or plant origin.

As used herein, the term \"organelle\" refers to cellular membrane-encapsulated structures such as the chloroplast, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrion. As used herein, \"introducing\" refers to the transfer of molecules such as ribosomes, tRNAs, translation factors and amino acids from outside a host cell or subcellular compartment to inside a host cell or subcellular compartment. Said molecules can be \"introduced\" into a host cell or subcellular compartment by any means known to those of skill in the art, for example as taught by Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York (2001), the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. Means of \"introducing\" molecules into a host cell or subcellular compartment include, but are not limited to heat shock, calcium phosphate transfection, electroporation, lipofection, and viral- mediated transfer. As used herein, the term \"transfection\" refers to introduction of a nucleic acid sequence into the interior of a membrane-enclosed space of a living cell, including introduction of the nucleic acid sequence into the cytosol of a cell as well as the interior space of a mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or chloroplast.

In another embodiment, the nucleic acid is incorporated into a vector. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"infection\" means the introduction of a nucleic acid such as\n\n\nDNA, RNA, tRNA into a recipient cell, subcellular compartment, or organism, by means of a virus.

Y., 2001.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"label\" or \"detectable label\" means a molecule that can be directly (i.e., a primary label) or indirectly (i.e., a secondary label) detected. For example, a label can be visualized and/or measured and/or otherwise identified so that its presence, absence, or a parameter or characteristic thereof can be measured and/or determined.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"fluorescent label\" refers to any molecule that can be detected via its inherent fluorescent properties, which include fluorescence detectable upon excitation. Suitable fluorescent labels include, but are not limited to, fluorescein, rhodamine, tetramethylrhodamine, eosin, erythrosin, coumarin, methyl-coumarins, pyrene, Malachite green, stilbene, Lucifer Yellow, Cascade BluerM, Texas Red, IAEDANS, EDANS, BODIPY FL, LC Red 640, Cy 3, Cy 5, Cy 5.5, Alexa, LC Red 705 and Oregon green, as well as to fluorescent derivatives thereof. Suitable optical dyes are described in The Tenth Edition of Haugland, RP. The Handbook: A Guide to Fluorescent Probes and Labeling Technologies. 10th. Invitrogen/Molecular Probes; Carlsbad, CA: 2005, hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Additional labels include but are not limit to fluorescent proteins, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), blue fluorescent protein (BFP), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) etc.\n\n\nAs used herein, \"tags\" can refer to any label known in the art, which can be detected either directly or indirectly.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"test compound\" refers to a compound to be tested by one or more screening assays of the invention as a putative agent that modulates translation activity. The test compounds of the invention encompass numerous classes of chemical molecules, though typically they are organic molecules, and preferentially of low molecular weight.\n\n\nThe term \"modulator\" as used herein is generic for an inhibitor or activator of translation.\n\n\nEXAMPLES \n\n Example 1: Labeling two parts of the translational machinery as a FRET pair\n\n\nTwo parts of the translational machinery are labeled as a FRET pair. For example, some tRNAs (Fig. 1) can be labeled with a donor fluorophore, and others with a corresponding acceptor fluorophore. An example of such a pair is FITC (excitation and emission peaks are 494 and 520nm, respectively) and TMR (excitation and emission peaks at 550 and 573nm, respectively); when translation is active, such tRNAs are immobilized in two adjacent sites (A and P or P and E) of the ribosome, thereby producing a FRET pair which produces measurable FRET signals. These signals indicate that the A and P sites are populated with labeled tRNAs. A small signal indicates that a low percentage of the A and P sites are populated, and therefore that the translation apparatus is in a state of low production rates. Additional exemplary, non- limiting FRET combinations are listed in Table 3.\n\n\nTable 3. Exemplary FRET combinations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree docked tRNAs are shown in Figure 1. The first 32 is in the A (Aminoacyl) site; the second (33) in the P (Peptidyl) site, and the amino acid it carries is at this point connected to the nascent peptide; the third (34) is in the E (exit) site, it has been discharged from the amino acid and will be ejected shortly from the ribosome. The heavy line 30 indicates the mRNA being translated, and the dotted line 45 represents the polypeptide being synthesized, tied into the Peptidyl position.\n\n\nThe main stages of elongation are as follows. Stage 1 : Codon recognition. A tRNA molecule carrying an amino acid binds to a vacant A-site, while the nascent polypeptide is attached to the P-site. Stage 2: Peptide bond creation. A new peptide bond is created \n\n and the polypeptide chain is moved to the A-site. Stage 3: Translocation. The ribosome translocates a distance of 3 nucleotides with respect to the mRNA, the two tRNA units and the polypeptide chain. Stage 4: the cycle repeats itself until a stop codon is reached.\n\n\nThree types of tRNA are shown with respect to fluorescent labeling. The tRNAs 40 and 43 are unlabeled. tRNAs 33, 34 and 42 (marked with vertical lines) are labeled as FRET donors. tRNAs 41 and 32 (marked with horizontal lines) are labeled as FRET acceptors.\n\n\nWhen freely diffusing (as in the case of 41 and 42), the chance of a FRET pair forming for a measurable length of time is negligible. However, when a pair is immobilized on the ribosome (as in the case of 32 and 33), a FRET pair is formed for about 50 milliseconds, which is sufficient for detection.\n\n\nThe more active the translation system, the larger the probability of juxtaposition of such pairs, and the larger the FRET signal. In addition, signal variability can be used to estimate the concentration of active ribosomes. Also, with a microscope, subcellular localization of protein synthesis can be quantitatively estimated. tRNAs pairs that are not immobilized in such a way either diffuse in he cytoplasm or else are bound to non- labeled molecules such as translation factors or amino-acyl synthetases, and therefore do not create FRET pairs, yielding no measurable signal. This basic principle holds for any choice of FRET pairs.\n\n\nNumerous pairs of the translational machinery can be considered for such assays, yielding particular pieces of information. Some of these are shown in Table 4 and Table\n\n\n5.\n\n\nTable 4: FRET pairs\n\n\n \n\n When tRNAs are labeled, one or more specific moieties may be labeled, or bulk tRNA of all species may be labeled as well.\n\n\nTable 5: Labeling Strategy Variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Labeling one part of the translational machinery with a single fluorophore\n\n\nThe single fluorophore method makes use of the technique of fluorescent anisotropy microscopy (see above). Thus, tRNAs which are freely diffusing in the cytoplasm produce a fluorescent signal that is only weakly polarized (in the polarization oriented as the excitation radiation), but tRNAs which are bound to ribosomes (which are thousands of times more massive) yield a highly polarized fluorescent signal, where the polarization is in the same plane as the excitation radiation.\n\n\nAccording to this embodiment, only one part of the translational machinery is labeled. The total signal is related to the fraction of bound labeled molecules. The more active the translation system, the larger the probability of production of such bound molecules and the larger the signal. Numerous members of the translation machinery can be considered for such assays, yielding particular pieces of information. Some of these are shown in Table 6. \n\n Table 6: Labeling with a single FIuorophore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3: Introduction of the labeled tRNAs into CHO cells\n\n\nLabeled tRNAs are transfected into CHO cells using TransMessenger transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells are placed under a microscope equipped for single molecule detection (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with an image acquisition device operable at a sufficient rate (10-100 frames per second), and computational units that can acquire and analyze the resulting images and data (Fig. 3). General ribosomal activity is measured.\n\n\nFor high-throughput screening, transfected cells are cultured in a 96-well plate format, compatible with automated screening. A robot administers one compound out of the library being screened into each well and translation detection is performed. A suitable sampling regime is adopted. The effect of the compound on translation activity is detected in comparison with negative control signal.\n\n\nExample 4. Diagnostic applications Bulk yeast tRNA is labeled with donor fluorophore and stored. Another batch of bulk yeast tRNA is labeled with acceptor fluorophore and stored. Prior to the assay, two aliquots of donor- and acceptor-labeled tRNA are mixed. The mixture is transfected into the cells to be diagnosed, for example, by using the transfection kit INTERFERinâ¢ (Autogen Bioclearâ¢, Wiltshire, UK). The cells may be human cells, for example, human cells obtained from a tissue removed by biopsy. The transfected cells are introduced into a 96 well-plate. Signals are collected from the plates using a \n\n fluorescent plate reader and are subjected to computerized analysis/es. Typically, the parameters derived for the analysis are: average signal strength, average signal deviation, or concentration of active ribosomes in each well. These parameters are monitored over time and in response to treatment. Values before and/or after treatment are compared to known standards to infer clinical parameters of the cells.\n\n\nIt should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.\n\n\nThe foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily modify and/or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without undue experimentation and without departing from the generic concept, and, therefore, such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments. Although the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims."

The N-OPE shown in Fig. 1 can be studied in solution, in colloidal suspensions, and attached, for example, by modification of the carboxyester \"headgroup,\" to surfaces by various covalent linkages.\n\n\n[029] Synthesis of the N-OPE units shown in Fig. 1 can be carried out by a multistep procedure as outlined in Fig. 2.

For example, N-OPE-3 is formed by reacting iterations of steps vi-viÏ and subsequent reaction of the longer chain compounds with compound 16.\n\n\n[043] While the synthetic steps are all straight-forward, those involving conversion of the diiodobenzene to 4-(4-iodophenyl)-2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol occur with lower yields and the desired products must be separated from structurally similar byproducts. The alkylamino groups were attached in an early step but converted to the quaternary ammonium derivatives as the last step of the synthesis. The intermediates and final products were characterized by mass spectrometry and proton and carbon NMR. N-OPE-I and N-OPE-2 are readily soluble in water and polar organic solvents such as methanol. Absorption and fluorescence spectra for N-OPE-I in water are shown in Fig. 3. Absorption and fluorescence spectra for N-OPE-2 in water are shown in Fig. 4. Table 1 gives quantum efficiencies for fluorescence and fluorescence lifetimes.\n\n\n[044| Table 1. Quantum Yields and fluorescence lifetimes of N-OPE- 1 and N-OPE-2.

In both solvents there is no concentration dependence of the spectra in the micromolar range and it seems likely that in both solvents the N-OPE are monomelic. While N-OPE-I and N-OPE- 2 both exhibit high fluorescence quantum efficiencies in methanol (quinine sulfate was used as a standard), the fluorescence is much weaker for both compounds in water with N-OPE-I having a quantum efficiency of -15% and N-OPE-2 having an efficiency of just over 1%. Fluorescent lifetimes in water are correspondingly shorter than in methanol. [046J According to another embodiment, the present disclosure provides symmetrical cationic oligophenylene ethynylenes (S-OPEs). One exemplary embodiment is the S-OPE-n- x family shown in Fig. 5, where Ï is a number between land 10 and x is H, CO\n^\nEt, COO\n\"\n, NH\n2\n or COCH\n3\n (referred to separately as S-OPE-n (H), S-OPE-n (CO\n2\nEt), S-OPE-n (COO\n\"\n), \n\n S-OPE-n (NH\n2\n), and S-OPE-n (COCH\n3\n). Because the symmetrical molecules can be built by adding the same unit to both sides of a symmetrical diiodobenzene derivative, the synthesis of the symmetrical molecules is much simpler than the synthesis of the unsymmetrical OPEs. [047] An exemplary synthesis method for the S-OPE-n (H) family (where n = 1, 2, or 3) can be carried out by a multi-step process as shown in Fig. 6. As shown, compounds 1-12 are identical to those shown in the N-OPE-n synthesis method shown in Fig. 2.

The absorption and fluorescence maxima for N-OPE-I and the three S-OPE-I compounds identified above are listed in Table 2. [055] Table 2: Fluorescence quantum efficiencies and lifetimes\n\n\nAbs.

Each of the compounds also exhibits a relatively broad structureless single fluorescence transition in the range 380-450 nm for both methanol and aqueous solutions. Furthermore, we have also synthesized and carried out studies of S-OPE-1 (x) where x = NH\n2\n, COCH\n3\n, both of these compounds show similar absorption spectra to that of S-OPE-1 (COOEt). The fluorescence of all four compounds shown in Table 2 is strong in methanol and there is little variation in fluorescence efficiency among the different substituted derivatives. However there is a significant variation in the fluorescence efficiencies in \n\n aqueous solution ranging from 0.02 for S-OPE-I (COOEt) to 0.80 for S-OPE-I (H). While the diester derivative S-OPE-I (COOEt) shows a very low fluorescence quantum efficiency in water, the dicarboxylate derivative shows very strong fluorescence in aqueous solution near neutral pH. Clearly the ester groups in N-OPE-I and S-OPE-I (COOEt) must play a major role in a solvent-dependent process which deactivates the excited singlet of the oligomers in water. Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was carried out on the OPEs in order to monitor the triplet states. For all four compounds in aqueous solution transients giving rise to broad transient absorption bands were observed in the mid-visible region with lifetimes in the microsecond range (Table 2). The transient lifetimes and spectra are consistent with a triplet state assignment. The lmax of triplet-triplet absorption shifts from 518 nm to 569 nm following the extent of conjugation: S-OPEl-H (518 nm), N-OPE-I (533 nm), S-OPE-I (COO-) (557 nm), then S-OPE-I (COOEt) (569 nm). The apparent triplet yields decrease in the order of S-OPE-I (H) > S-OPE-I (COO-) Â» N-OPE-I Â» S-OPE-I (COOEt). The triplet lifetimes follow a similar trend as the triplet yield (Table 2). Interestingly, the relatively low triplet yield for S-OPE-I (COOEt) mirrors the low fluorescence quantum yield, suggesting that the triplet formation is suppressed by the same mechanism that quenches the singlet state. [057] According to yet another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a symmetrical cationic oligophenylene ethynylenes that includes cationic groups at both ends of the OPE chain, but not in the middle. An exemplary embodiment is the S-OPE-I-EO shown in Fig. 7. An exemplary synthesis scheme for S-OPE-I-EO is shown in Fig. 8.\n\n\n[058] According to still another embodiment, the present disclosure provides dimers or large aggregates of the presently disclosed compounds. According to an example, the presently- described compounds are allowed to self-assemble on an anionic scaffold such as carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), carboxymethylamylose (CMA) or Laponite clay. [059] It has been previously determined that several cationic cyanine dyes self-assemble on CMC, CMA and Laponite clay to form J-aggregates characterized by sharp red-shifted bands in both absorption and fluorescence spectra. See e.g., Jones, R. M.; Bergstedt, T. S.; Buscher, C. T.; McBranch, D.; Whitten, D. Langmuir 2001, 17, 2568-2571; Lu, L. D.; Jones, R. M.; McBranch, D.; Whitten, D. Langmuir 2002, 18, 7706-7713; Kim, O. K.; Je, J.; Jernigan, G.; Buckley, L.; Whitten, D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 510-516; and Whitten, D. G.; Achyuthan, K. E.; Lopez, G. P.; Kim, O. K. Pure Appl. Chem. 2006, 78, 2313-2323, each of which is incorporated by reference. All three of these materials are transparent in the near uv \n\n where the OPE absorb and aggregation should be easily followed by changes in absorption and/or fluorescence spectra.\n\n\n[060] N-OPE:CMC complexes can be formed by adding small aliquots of CMC to aqueous solutions containing the N-OPE compound. For both N-OPE-I and N-OPE-2 there are similar striking changes in both the absorption and fluorescence spectra upon addition of small aliquots of CMC to aqueous solutions as shown in Figs. 9-12. Fig. 9 shows the absorption spectra of N-OPE-I upon addition of various CMC concentrations. [N-OPE-I] = 1.5 x 10\n\"5\n M. Fig. 10 shows the fluorescence spectra of N-OPE-I upon addition of CMC. [N- OPE-I] = 1.5 x 10\n\"5\n and [CMC] = 5.0 x 10\n\"5\n M. Fig. 11 shows the absorption spectra for N- OPE-2 upon addition of CMC. [N-OPE-2] = 1.5 x 10\n\"5\n M. Fig. 12 shows the fluorescence spectra of N-OPE-2 upon addition of CMC. [N-OPE-2] = 1.5 x 10\n\"5\n and [CMC] = 0 - 4.2 x 10\n\"\n M. Both excitation and emission slits are 2.5nm. Excitation wavelength for N-OPE-I is 355 nm and for N-OPE-2 is 375 nm. For both N-OPEs there are several isosbestic points in the absorption spectra as the two bands in the absorption for water alone are replaced by a spectrum of the N-OPE: CMC having two bands at longer wavelength. For both N-OPEs the fluorescence also undergoes a red shift and increase in intensity as aliquots of CMC are added, finally leveling off at moderate concentrations (greater than 1 mM) of CMC. The increase in fluorescence of N-OPE-I is at least three- fold while that for N-OPE-2 is at least 14-fold. The clean spectral evolution and structured spectrum for the N-OPE-CMC complexes suggest that the N-OPEs are assembling on the planar sheets of CMC as discrete units. We suggest these spectral shifts could be attributed to the formation of dimers, most likely extended linearly as \"J\" type dimers. The spectral shifts seem reasonable for a linear dimer; we note that the absorption spectrum of N-OPE-I :CMC is slightly red-shifted compared to N-OPE-2 in water alone. Comparing the estimated length of the linear N-OPE \"rigid rod\" the \"conjugation length\" of a linear N-OPE-I dimer should be slightly longer than that of N-OPE-2. The spectral shifts are also consistent with \"planarization\" of the chromophores for a monomer assembling on the scaffold.\n\n\n[061] The N-OPE-CMC complexes can also be generated by addition of small aliquots of the N-OPE to a fixed concentration of CMC. When this was done with N-OPE-I, the very lowest concentrations of N-OPE-I produced absorption indicative of a mixture of monomer and complex; as the (N-OPE-I) increased the spectra indicated only the complex was being formed on the CMC until a limiting ratio of (N-OPE- l):(moles of CMC polymer repeat units) (CMCPRU) = 18:50 is reached. As additional N-OPE-I is added only the monomer spectrum \n\n is observed to grow indicating that saturation of the CMC scaffold has occurred. For N-OPE- 2 with CMC, addition of even the lowest concentrations of N-OPE-2 result in the spectral signature of what we suggest should be a \"J\" dimer and the limiting concentration ratio of (N- OPE-2): (CMCPRU) = 14:50. Here again as additional N-OPE-2 is added only the monomer spectrum increases.\n\n\n[062] We also examined the interactions between CMA and the two N-OPE in aqueous solution. Addition of CMA to an aqueous solution of N-OPE-I does not generate a spectrally observable aggregate. A monotonic decrease in the absorption of N-OPE-I is observed (275- 380 nm) upon addition of aliquots of CMA with the only increase in absorption being a small shoulder near 400 nm. There is a small increase in fluorescence and then a subsequent decrease with addition of CMA. In contrast, when aliquots of CMA are added to a solution of N-OPE-2 an intense red-shifted absorption grows in, very similar to that observed for CMC and a corresponding increase and red-shift in fluorescence. The fluorescence of the N- 0PE-2:CMA complex is more than ten-fold increased compared to N-OPE-2 in water. [063] The isosbestic points obtained in the association of the N-OPE with CMC and CMA suggest that a two-state model can be used and we assume that the equilibrium is for the reaction:\n\n\n2 N-OPE + CMC (or CMA) = CMC:(N-0PE)2 where K = [CMC:(N-OPE)2]/(N-OPE)2(CMC). Binding constants (assuming that an N-OPE dimer is formed in each case) can be estimated from a determination of the individual absorbances of the two species following a treatment for a similar two-state system developed by Pasternack and co-workers. See, e.g., Pasternack, R. F.; Goldsmith, J. L; Szep, S.; Gibbs, E. J. Biophys. J. 1998, 75, 1024-1031, which is incorporated by reference. The absorbances, extinction coefficients and concentrations were determined and used to estimate K. The obtained values (K = 1.3 X 1010 M-2 for CMC:(N-OPE-2)2 and K = 2.4X1012 M-2 for CMA:(N-OPE-2)2; values for the CMC complex with N-OPE-I are less accurate and slightly lower) indicate that the complexes are tightly bound. For N-OPE-2 addition of either CMC or CMA results in an induced circular dichroism (CD) spectrum as shown in Figs. 13 and 14. Fig. 13 shows the circular dichroism spectra of N-OPE-2 upon addition of CMA. [N-OPE-2] = 1.5 x 10\n\"5\n and [CMA] = 0 - 2.8 x 10\n\"5\n M. Fig. 14 shows the circular dichroism spectra of N-OPE-2 upon addition of CMC. [N-OPE-2] = 1.5 x 10\n\"5\n and [CMC] = 0 - 4.4 x 10\n\"5\n M. The induced CD observed for N-OPE-2 and CMA is strong and biphasic with a change in phase of the induced CD exactly corresponding to the maximum in the J-dimer absorption. This is \n\n similar to what was observed for CMA complex formation with a cyanine dye J-aggregate reported earlier and attributed to a cooperative self-assembly into a helical arrangement for the host-guest complex. See, e.g., Kim, O. K.; Je, J.; Jernigan, G.; Buckley, L.; Whitten, D. /. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 510-516, which is incorporated by reference. A similar structure may thus be reasonable for the CMA:N-0PE-2 complex. For the N-OPE-2 complex with CMC, the induced CD spectrum is much weaker and contains two bands corresponding to different absorptions: the longer wavelength band (negative) overlaps the transition we attribute to a J-dimer of N-OPE-2 while the shorter wavelength band (positive) overlaps the monomer of N-OPE-2.\n\n\n[064] Both N-OPEs were found to undergo very different spectral changes when aqueous solutions were treated with aliquots of nanoparticulate Laponite clay. For N-OPE-I the two banded spectrum in the near UV decreased in intensity with addition of Laponite and shifted to shorter wavelengths (see Figs. 15 and 16 where Fig. 15 shows the absorption spectra of N- OPE-I upon addition of Laponite [N-OPE-I] = 3.0 x 10\n\"6\n and Fig. 16 shows the fluorescence spectra of N-OPE-I upon addition of Laponite [N-OPE-I] = 3.0 x 10\n\"\n , both excitation slits are 5.0 nm) while the fluorescence decreased in intensity and was observed to undergo a red- shift in the maximum from 420 nm to 450 nm. For N-OPE-2 a similar decrease and blue- shift in the monomer absorption was observed, however a clear shoulder at longer wavelengths is observable and the fluorescence increased with addition of Laponite. These spectral changes are consistent with formation of an H-aggregate or more likely an H-dimer in both cases. See e.g., Song, X. D.; Perlstein, J.; Whitten, D. G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 9144-9159, which is incorporated by reference. Based on estimates of the area of N- OPE-I and N-OPE-2 and the surface area of Laponite we calculate that coverage of the clay by N-OPE-I reaches a limiting value at -45% coverage and for N-OPE-2 the limiting value is approximately 100%. A schematic of the proposed self-assembly processes occurring with the N-OPE is shown in Fig 15, where F denotes a forbidden excited state, A denotes an allowed excited state and IC denotes internal conversion.\n\n\n[065] In studies with cationic PPE polymers we have found that their fluorescence is strongly quenched by the anionic electron acceptor 9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid (AQS) for both solution phase polymer and microsphere- supported physisorbed polymers. The fluorescence quenching is attributed to ground state association of the AQS with the polymer by a combination of Coulombic and hydrophobic effects and a rapid electron transfer quenching of the excited state. For the PPE polymers there is normally very little change in \n\n the polymer absorption spectrum. For both N-OPE-I and N-OPE-2 addition of AQS to solutions of the oligomers results in both a strong spectral change and efficient quenching of the oligomer fluorescence. The absorption spectral changes that occur when AQS is added to solutions of the N-OPE are almost identical to those observed when CMC is added to the compounds and indicates that the relatively small molecule AQS is also providing a template onto which the N-OPE can form a J-dimer. The spectrum of the AQS is relatively little perturbed by association with the N-OPE suggesting that the ground state charge transfer interaction may be very weak. In contrast to the results when the N-OPEs are added to CMC and CMA, the formation of the J-dimers on AQS is accompanied by quenching of the oligomer fluorescence and there is no fluorescence from the templated J-dimers of the N-OPE when dimer formation is complete. Stern- Volmer quenching constants can be obtained for the early (low (AQS)) stages of the complex formation/quenching and the values obtained (Ksv = 6.7 X 103 M-I and 8.1 X 104 M-I are reasonable based on a largely Coulombic association between multiply charged cations and anions.\n\n\n[066] The results suggest that the cationic N-OPE' s readily participate in strong host-guest interactions with anionic scaffolds and that this interaction may be quite general. The formation of linear \"J-dimers\" results in substantial absorption and fluorescence spectral shifts to lower energies that suggest an effective increase in conjugation length. Our results with the first two members of the series suggest that the magnitude of these effects and the formation of dramatically shifted supramolecular complexes may be enhanced as the length of the N-OPE is extended to the next members of the series (i.e., N-OPE-3 and N-OPE-4). [067] Self-assembly is not limited solely to the non-symmetrical N-OPE compounds. The three cationic oligomers, S-OPE-I (H), N-OPE-I and S-OPE-I (COOEt) all show striking changes in absorption and fluorescence when CMC (Sigma Aldrich, degree of carboxyl substitution (DS) = 0.7) is added to aqueous solutions (oligomer concentration -15 mM) in the mM concentration range. Fig. 18 shows the absorption spectral changes of S-OPE-I (COOEt) upon addition of aliquots of CMC to an aqueous solution of S-OPE-I(COOEt). Fig. 19 shows fluorescent spectral changes under the same conditions. Similar spectral changes, but with less pronounced red shifts, are observed over the same concentration range for S-OPE-I (H) and N-OPE-I. Interestingly, there are no changes observed when a similar study is made for S-OPE-I (COO-) with CMC at near neutral pH. The changes that occur for S-OPE-I (H), N-OPE-I and S-OPE-I (COOEt) (sharp, red shifted absorption spectra, isosbestic points maintained throughout the CMC addition and red-shifted fluorescence) are \n\n consistent with an extension of effective conjugation for the oligomers on the carboxylate decorated surface of the CMC. The fluorescence quantum efficiency of the oligomer: CMC complex shows a dramatic increase for S-OPE-I (COOEt) (more than 18-fold), a strong increase for N-OPE-I and very little change for S-OPE-I (H). The absorption and fluorescence maxima for N-OPE-1/CMC, S-0PE-l(H)/CMC and S-OPE-I (COOEt)/CMC are listed in Table 3.\n\n\nTable 3 Fluorescence Quantum Efficiencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[068] The spectroscopic behavior of S-OPE-1 (COOEt) with CMC is reminiscent of the formation of cyanine J-aggregates templated on carboxymethylamylose and CMC. See, e.g., Kim, O.-K.; Je, J.; Jernigan, G.; Buckley, L.; Whitten, D. G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 510-516; and Whitten, D. G.; Achyuthan, K. E.; Lopez, G. P.; Kim, O.-K. Pure Appl. Chem. 2006, 78, 2313-2323. The increase in effective conjugation could be attributed either to planarization or to formation of J-dimers. Structurally similar OPE's have been investigated in organic solvent systems; although there is indicated to be little barrier to rotation of the phenyl rings from a totally coplanar structure, the completely planar system is estimated to be a slight energy minimum. Additionally in this experimental and computational study the absorption spectrum calculated for a completely planar structure is similar to those shown in Figs. 18 and 19 and Table 2 and also to that found for the N-OPE. As with other cases of host-guest complex formation in aqueous media, the formation of a planarized monomer or J-dimer of the oligomers on CMC is likely attributable to a combination of favorable Coulombic and hydrophobic interactions between the host and guest with favorable molecular topographies either pre-existing or induced during the complex formation. The failure of S- OPE-I (COO-) to interact with CMC is not surprising since it should be a zwitterion at neutral pH and thus there should be no Coulombic attraction towards the CMC host. [069] The sharply reduced fluorescence of the two ester containing oligomers, N-OPE-1 and S-OPE-1 (COOEt) in aqueous solution, compared to methanol, is remarkable and unprecedented for simple aromatic esters. While we do not yet know the origin of these \n\n effects, we have found that other S-OPE-I with different substituents (X = NH2, -C0CH3) exhibit similar reduced fluorescence in water.\n\n\n[070] The strong spectral red shifts in both absorption and fluorescence coupled with the increase in fluorescence efficiency upon complexation with CMC, suggests that S-OPE-I (COOEt) and other oligomers having extended p conjugation may be useful in sensing applications similar to those already demonstrated for certain cationic cyanines and anionic biopolymers such as hyaluronic acid and DNA. It is striking that excitation of S-OPE-I (COOEt) in water at 412 nm results in an increase from essentially no fluorescence at 470 nm to a very strong fluorescence easily detectable at micromolar concentrations of CMC repeat units. Since oligomers having extended symmetrical structures from the structure of 2 can be readily generated with a variety of substituents and other structural features, it should be possible to generate a versatile library of dyes and fluorescent probes extending into the visible region.\n\n\n[071] As stated above, at least some of the compounds described herein are useful in sensing applications. One particularly useful sensing application is DNA detection. Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a novel DNA detection mechanism. According to various embodiments, this detection mechanism does not involving labeling of the DNA and furthermore, is able to differentiate between single and double stranded DNA. [072] Specifically, some OPEs display circular dichroism (CD) signals when bound to either single stranded (ss) or double stranded (ds) DNA. Moreover, in some cases, the signals are noticeably different depending on whether the OPE is bound to ds or ss DNA. Accordingly, this signal differential can be exploited to detect hybridization events.\n\n\n[073] As an example, N-OPE-2 and S-OPE-I (COOEt) provide useful circular dichroism (CD)- based detection mechanisms because they display a detectable CD signal when bound to DNA. Furthermore, the signal varies noticeably, depending on whether the OPE is bound to ds or ss DNA. In an example, CD experiments were carried out as follows: ssDNA ([ssDNA] = 6.9 X 10\n\"6\nM) or dsDNA ([dsDNA] = 6.9 X 10\n\"6\nM) was added to a solution of N- OPE-2 ([N-OPE-2] = 1.5 X 10\n\"5\n M ) in 220 Î¼L phosphate buffer (25 mM, pH 7.4). The solution was then incubated for 30 s. The CD spectra were measured at room temperature. The CD spectra (Fig. 20, where [N-OPE-2] = 5.0 x 10\n\"6\n M, [dsDNA] = [ssDNA] = 1.1 x 10\n\"6\n M.) obtained showed that the N-OPE-2:ssDNA complexes produced a strong positive CD signal, while the N-OPE-2:dsDNA had a detectable, but much weaker signal. The N-OPE-2 can form complexes with dsDNA along the two phosphate backbones, so it is possible that \n\n the CD signal of N-OPE-s:dsDNA complexes is obstructed. Accordingly, the differential in\n\n\nCD singal between ssDNA and dsDNA complexes can be exploited to detect hybridization events.\n\n\n[074] Similarly, some OPEs display detectable fluorescence when bound to ds or ss DNA.\n\n\nAgain, some compounds reflect a noticeable difference in the fluorescence spectra when bound to ds versus ss DNA.\n\n\n[075] As an example, N-OPE-2 provides a useful fluorescence-based detection mechanism because it displays a detectable fluorescence signal when bound to DNA. Again, the signal varies noticeably, depending on whether the N-OPE-2 is bound to ds or ss DNA. However, in this case, the signal is stronger when the N-OPE-2 is bound to dsDNA. The fluorescence experiments are performed as follows. A 2 mL of phosphate buffer solution (25 mM, pH 7.4) was added to 10 Î¼L N-OPE-2 ([N-OPE-2] = 5.0 X 10\n\"6\n M) at room temperature. Either ssDNA or dsDNA was then added to the N-OPE-s solution successively. The fluorescence spectra were measured after mixing for 30 s. When the concentrations of dsDNA and ssDNA are 1.1 X 10\n\"6\n M, the fluorescence intensity of the complexes of N-OPE-2 / dsDNA is much greater than that of the complexes of N-OPE-2 / ssDNA.\n\n\n[076] Fig. 21 depicts I\nS\ni\ngna\ni/I\nb\ni\nank\n as a function of DNA concentration in phosphate buffer (25 mM, pH 7.4 [N-=OPE-2] = 5.0 x 10-6 M. The excitation wavelength is 378 nm. It can be seen that the plot for N-OPE-2 / dsDNA is higher than for N-OPE-2 / ssDNA. This is because the interactions between N-OPE-2 and dsDNA are stronger than that of N-OPE-2 and ssDNA, since N-OPE-2 can more easily form complexes with dsDNA. Accordingly, this differential in binding strength between dsDNA and ssDNA can be exploited to detect DNA hybridization without labeling the DNA, simply by detecting a differential in fluorescence spectra.\n\n\n[077] As described in greater detail below, the OPEs described herein have varying levels of both dark and light-induced biocidal activity. Penetration of the bacterial membrane and binding of OPEs with DNA may provide paths for this activity. Accordingly, in yet another embodiment, the present disclosure provides novel biocides formed from the OPEs described herein.\n\n\n[078] The OPEs described herein have been synthesized and studied as dark and light activated biocides towards a Gram negative bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Strain\n\n\nPAOl. The unsymmetrical compounds, N-OPE-I, N-OPE-2 and N-OPE-3, terminated in each case by a carboxy ester or carboxylic acid, are active biocides both in solution and \n\n attached to surfaces. N-OPE-I is active as a biocide under short term irradiation with near ultraviolet light, but relatively inactive when exposed to the bacteria in the dark for periods of up to one hour. In contrast, N-OPE-2 and N-OPE-3 are active against bacteria both in the dark and in the light. N-OPE-I has been attached to surfaces by covalent linkage. This has been accomplished for both micron sized glass beads and glass slides. The bead-grafted N- OPE-I has been studied as a biocide and has been found to exhibit the ability to capture Pseudomonas a. in a dark process (relatively little killing of the bacteria in the dark over - 15 minutes,) and to exhibit good biocidal activity on irradiation with 365 nm uv. The biocidal activity of bead crafted N-OPE-I is comparable or stronger than that of solution phase N- OPE-I. We anticipate that bead and planar surface grafted N-0PE-n (n>l) will exhibit strong dark and light-induced biocidal activity.\n\n\n[079] Three S-OPE-n (x = H) have been studied as biocides with suspensions of Pseudomonas and it has been found that the light-activated biocidal activity increases in the series S-OPE-I (x = H) < S-OPE-2 (x = H). Dark biocidal activity (much slower) was observed for S-OPE-2 (x = H) and S-OPE-3 (x = H). Biocidal activity is comparable for members of the N-OPE-n series and for the S-OPE-n (x = H).\n\n\n[080] S-OPE-EO has remarkable biocidal activity in the dark and upon uv irradiation against Gram positive Bacillus atrophaeus. Samples of the bacterial exposed to S-OPE-EO in the dark show several log kills following 6 hour exposure (a live control shows very little killing). A similar sample irradiated with 365 nm uv light shows almost the same level killing after 30 minutes.\n\n\n[081] Previous studies have shown that certain conjugated polylectrolytes exhibit visible light-activated biocidal activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria such as E. coli and B. anthracis. In these studies it was found that exposure of solutions of the polymer to suspensions of bacteria results in coating of the cationic polymer onto the surface of the bacteria. Irradiation of the polymer-coated bacteria results in killing of the bacteria. Subsequent investigations have shown that these same polymers can be effective at killing bacteria when incorporated into coatings either by physisorbing the polymer to a surface or by grafting the polymer covalently to a surface. The polymer coatings are active in trapping bacteria in the dark and the entrapped bacteria can be killed slowly in the dark or much more rapidly by irradiation with visible light. Recent experiments have demonstrated that the light activated biocidal activity is initiated by interfacial sensitization of a reactive oxygen intermediate. Singlet oxygen is certainly the initially formed reactive oxygen intermediate \n\n but more corrosive species may be generated in subsequent steps. The OPEs of the present disclosure can be formed into biocidal polymers using the above-described self-assembly, or other suitable, techniques.\n\n\n[082] Furthermore, much recent work has been devoted to the development of materials whose properties can be altered drastically by relatively small changes in properties such as temperature, pressure, solution or suspension properties (including but not limited to pH); these \"stimuli responsive materials\" (SRM) are often prepared as polymers or as surfaces prepared from components that can be covalently linked or self assembled on surfaces. Smart polymers that have found use in biotechnology and medicine have been described by I Yu Galaev in Russian Chemical Reviews 64: 471-489 (1995); A. S. Hoffman in Clinical Chemistry 46:1478-1486 (2000) and H. G. Schild, Prog. Polym. ScL 17, 163 (1992), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n[083] Prominent examples of SRMs include poly (N-isopropyl-acrylamide) (PNIPAAM) and oligo-ethylene glycol oligomers terminated with a thiol (OEG). The former can be grown from a surface by attaching an initiator monomer to a surface and following this with in situ polymerization. Through an ATRP process; the thickness of the resulting film can be controlled as a function of incubation time at a fixed catalyst and monomer concentration. The OEGs can be attached to a surface (usually Au) by covalent assembly as a self-assembled monolayer (SAM). For surfaces coated with either PNIPAAM or OEG there is a strong temperature dependence of the film properties. In both cases, films formed from these materials in contact with an aqueous solution exist as hydrated, expanded films at low temperatures that are relatively unreactive and non-adsorbtive towards various biological species including proteins, cells, bacteria, viruses, and the like. Above a specific lower critical solution temperature (LCST) the films contract, releasing water and become very hydrophobic. At temperatures higher than the LCST films from either SRM become thinner and strongly attract proteins, cells and other biological species that do not bind below the LCST.\n\n\n[084] According to yet another embodiment, the present disclosure provides films and assemblies containing both SRM components and oligomeric units of the conjugated OPEs described above. Exemplary features of one example of these two-component bi-functional films are shown in Figure 22. In general, these assembles provide a novel functional material that can be switched between active and inactive forms wherein, in the active form, the material is able to capture a biological species of interest and, in the inactive form, the \n\n material is able to release the biological species. In some embodiments the material can be switched between active and inactive forms repeatedly, allowing for reuse of the same material. Films containing these two functional components can be readily prepared by covalent synthesis or by a self assembly process employing a mixture of individual SRM and OPE thiols.\n\n\n[085] Viewing Fig. 22, it can be seen that at low temperatures an OPE of appropriate length is buried amidst the expanded form of the SRM and inaccessible to any biological species (such as a protein, cell, bacteria, virus, etc.) present in the aqueous media. Moreover, these species are not attracted to the surface and do not associate with it. However, as the temperature is elevated above the LCST, contraction of the SRM component \"unsheathes\" the OPE. Both components are now hydrophobic and strongly attractive. Accordingly, the unsheathed OPE is able to form a complex with the biological species.\n\n\n[086] Accordingly, in one embodiment, the presently described structure can form a reusable biocidal material. Under low temperatures the antimicrobial activity of the OPE is masked by the extended SRMs and therefore inactive. As stated above, elevation of the temperature above the LCST unsheathes the OPE, which is then allowed to form a complex with, thereby trapping, the bacteria. The OPE' s biocidal activity is then exploited to inactivate, kill or destroy the trapped species, under either dark conditions or under uv light irradiation. Following destruction of the pathogen, the film will typically be contaminated with debris from the killed bacteria or cell. Returning the film to temperatures lower than the LCST results in expansion of the SRM, forcing the debris away from the OPEs. The result is a self-cleaning, reusable, biocidal film.\n\n\n[087] Examples of other practical uses for these mixed films include employing them as an active sensor which can be monitored by steady state fluorescence or by laser interferometery. The attachment of protein, cells or bacteria to the surface can be detected, for example, by the monitoring irradiation.\n\n\n[088] The present disclosure further provides methods of manufacturing the functional materials described herein. Thiol terminated OEG derivatives are commercially available in a wide range of structures. A method of synthesis of PNIPAAM by monomer polymerization onto an initiator functionalized surface is shown in Fig. 23.\n\n\n[089] Synthesis of a wide variety of OPE units is described above. The OPE derivatives can be concerted to the carboxylic acid which can be then surface linked to an amine \n\n functionalized surface or converted to a thiol and attached to gold at the same time as an OEG derivative.\n\n\n[090] All patents and publications referenced or mentioned herein are indicative of the levels of skill of those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains, and each such referenced patent or publication is hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if it had been incorporated by reference in its entirety individually or set forth herein in its entirety.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n PROTEÃNAS OLIGOMERICAS Y SUS APLICACIONES\nÂ OLIGOMERIC PROTEINS AND ITS APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAMPO DE LA INVENCIÃN\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa invenciÃ³n se relaciona con una proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica que comprende una pluralidad de proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n, iguales o diferentes, y un marcador, en la que cada proteÃ­na de fusiÃ³n comprende un polipÃ©ptido que comprende un anticuerpo o un fragmento funcionalmente equivalente de dicho anticuerpo, y un polipÃ©ptido que comprende un dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n. Dichas proteÃ­nas oligomÃ©ricas pueden ser utilizadas para detectar, visualizar y localizar dianas de interÃ©s.\nThe invention relates to an oligomeric protein comprising a plurality of fusion proteins, the same or different, and a label, wherein each fusion protein comprises a polypeptide comprising an antibody or a functionally equivalent fragment of said antibody, and a polypeptide comprising an oligomerization domain. Said oligomeric proteins can be used to detect, visualize and locate targets of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nANTECEDENTES DE LA INVENCIÃN\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLos procedimientos de imagen en medicina se refieren a tÃ©cnicas y procesos no invasivos usados para crear imÃ¡genes del aspecto interno del cuerpo de un animal, para propÃ³sitos clÃ­nicos, por ejemplo, procedimientos mÃ©dicos para diagnosticar una enfermedad o para localizar dicha enfermedad. En un sentido amplio, incluye tÃ©cnicas tales como ciencias radiolÃ³gicas, endoscopia, termografÃ­a mÃ©dica y microscopÃ­a. Tradicionalmente, los estudios de laboratorio para evaluar la actividad de las terapias anticancerÃ­genas en ratones han requerido el sacrificio de mÃºltiples animales en cada etapa para proporcionar datos significativos. Las tÃ©cnicas de imagen, sin embargo, permiten una evaluaciÃ³n precisa del crecimiento tumoral y a tiempo real en animales de laboratorio, lo que disminuye de forma considerable el nÃºmero de sujetos requeridos.\nImaging procedures in medicine refer to non-invasive techniques and processes used to create images of the internal appearance of an animal's body, for clinical purposes, for example, medical procedures to diagnose a disease or to locate said disease. In a broad sense, it includes techniques such as radiological sciences, endoscopy, medical thermography and microscopy. Traditionally, laboratory studies to evaluate the activity of anticancer therapies in mice have required the sacrifice of multiple animals at each stage to provide significant data. Imaging techniques, however, allow an accurate evaluation of tumor growth and in real time in laboratory animals, which considerably decreases the number of subjects required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa tomografÃ­a por emisiÃ³n de positrones, TEP o PET (por las siglas en inglÃ©s de PositrÃ³n Emission Tomography) es una tÃ©cnica propia de una especialidad mÃ©dica llamada medicina nuclear y de la radiologÃ­a, al combinar imÃ¡genes de TAC (ejemplos de imÃ¡genes 3D). Se trata de una tÃ©cnica no invasiva de diagnÃ³stico e investigaciÃ³n por imagen capaz de medir la actividad metabÃ³lica de los diferentes tejidos del cuerpo humano, especialmente del sistema nervioso central. Al igual que el resto de tÃ©cnicas diagnÃ³sticas en Medicina Nuclear, la TEP se basa en detectar y analizar la distribuciÃ³n que adopta en el interior del cuerpo un radioisÃ³topo administrado a travÃ©s de una inyecciÃ³n. La TEP permite, por ejemplo, localizar los focos de crecimiento celular anormal en todo el organismo, en un solo estudio e independientemente de la localizaciÃ³n anatÃ³mica donde se presente la neoplasia (primaria o metastÃ¡sica), ya que \n\n Ia TEP no evalÃºa la morfologÃ­a de los tejidos, sino su metabolismo. Por tanto, se ha implantado con mucha fuerza como tÃ©cnica diagnÃ³stica en oncologÃ­a, ademÃ¡s de otras Ã¡reas, como son la cardiologÃ­a, la neurologÃ­a y la psicobiologÃ­a, dada la posibilidad de cuantificar el metabolismo tanto cardiaco como en el sistema nervioso central. La tÃ©cnica de fluorescencia es una tÃ©cnica de imagen que permite estudiar las propiedades de sustancias orgÃ¡nicas o inorgÃ¡nicas utilizando el fenÃ³meno de fluorescencia. En la mayorÃ­a de los casos, se marca especÃ­ficamente un componente de interÃ©s en la muestra, con una molÃ©cula fluorescente llamada fluorÃ³foro. La muestra se ilumina con luz de una determinada/s longitud/es de onda, que es absorbida por los fluorÃ³ foros, originando una emisiÃ³n de luz a longitudes de onda mayores (o a diferente color que la luz absorbida). La cantidad y la longitud de onda de la energÃ­a emitida dependen del fluorÃ³foro y del entorno quÃ­mico del fluorÃ³foro. Entre los fluorÃ³ foros mÃ¡s comÃºnmente utilizados se encuentran la fluoresceÃ­na isotiocianato (FITC), los derivados de la rodamina (TRITC), comarina y cianina, los fluorÃ³foros \"Alexa Fluor\" y \"DyLight Fluor\", la familia de la cianina (e.g., Cy3, Cy5 y Cy 7).\nPositron Emission Tomography (Positron Emission Tomography) is a technique of a medical specialty called nuclear medicine and radiology, when combining CT images (examples of 3D images). It is a non-invasive diagnostic and imaging technique capable of measuring the metabolic activity of the different tissues of the human body, especially the central nervous system. Like the rest of diagnostic techniques in Nuclear Medicine, PET is based on detecting and analyzing the distribution that a radioisotope administered through an injection adopts inside the body. PET allows, for example, to locate the foci of abnormal cell growth throughout the organism, in a single study and regardless of the anatomical location where the neoplasm occurs (primary or metastatic), since  The PET does not evaluate the morphology of the tissues, but their metabolism. Therefore, it has been implanted with great force as a diagnostic technique in oncology, in addition to other areas, such as cardiology, neurology and psychobiology, given the possibility of quantifying both cardiac and central nervous system metabolism. The fluorescence technique is an imaging technique that allows you to study the properties of organic or inorganic substances using the fluorescence phenomenon. In most cases, a component of interest in the sample is specifically labeled, with a fluorescent molecule called fluorophore. The sample is illuminated with light of a certain wavelength / s, which is absorbed by the fluorinated forums, causing light emission at longer wavelengths (or at a different color than the absorbed light). The amount and wavelength of the energy emitted depend on the fluorophore and the chemical environment of the fluorophore. Among the most commonly used fluorinated forums are fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), rhodamine derivatives (TRITC), comarin and cyanine, fluorophores \"Alexa Fluor\" and \"DyLight Fluor\", the cyanine family (eg, Cy3 , Cy5 and Cy 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa tÃ©cnica de imagen por fluorescencia in vivo es igual que la microscopÃ­a de fluorescencia, difiere Ãºnicamente en que trabaja a nivel macroscÃ³pico. Los objetos para imagen por fluorescencia son el cuerpo completo de (pequeÃ±os) animales. MolÃ©culas que absorben en la regiÃ³n del infrarrojo cercano (NIR), 700-1.000 nm, pueden ser utilizadas para visualizar e investigar dianas moleculares in vivo, ya que la mayorÃ­a de los tejidos generan poca fluorescencia NIR. Los fluorÃ³foros orgÃ¡nicos NIR mÃ¡s comunes son las polimetinas (e.g., pentametina y heptametina). Las sondas utilizadas para imagen por fluorescencia in vivo pueden ser dirigidas o no dirigidas. Las dirigidas tienen la ventaja de que se pueden dirigir especÃ­ficamente a un tejido diana. De esta manera, las sondas se unen a sus dianas, mientras que las no unidas se eliminan de la circulaciÃ³n. Esta aproximaciÃ³n es muy Ãºtil para realizar imÃ¡genes de tumores in vivo, ya que en cÃ¡ncer, normalmente se sobreexpresan ciertos receptores de superficie. Un ejemplo de sondas dirigidas pueden ser molÃ©culas de anticuerpos conjugadas con cianinas o \"quantum dots\". TambiÃ©n se pueden utilizar molÃ©culas mÃ¡s pequeÃ±as dirigidas, en lugar de anticuerpos, por ejemplo Ã¡cido fÃ³lico conjugado con un fluorocromo NIR que proporciona imÃ¡genes de macrÃ³fagos activados implicados en enfermedades inflamatorias de articulaciones. Dichas molÃ©culas irÃ­an dirigidas al \n\n receptor de Ã¡cido fÃ³lico. Dentro del grupo de las sondas dirigidas, los anticuerpos presentan la ventaja de su rÃ¡pido aislamiento y que tienen una alta afinidad por virtualmente, cualquier antÃ­geno.\nThe in vivo fluorescence imaging technique is the same as fluorescence microscopy, it differs only in that it works at the macroscopic level. The objects for fluorescence imaging are the whole body of (small) animals. Molecules that absorb in the near infrared region (NIR), 700-1,000 nm, can be used to visualize and investigate molecular targets in vivo, since most tissues generate little NIR fluorescence. The most common NIR organic fluorophores are polymethines (eg, pentametine and heptametin). The probes used for in vivo fluorescence imaging can be directed or non-directed. Targeting has the advantage that they can specifically target a target tissue. In this way, the probes join their targets, while the unbound are removed from the circulation. This approach is very useful for imaging tumors in vivo, since in cancer, certain surface receptors are normally overexpressed. An example of targeted probes can be cyanine-conjugated antibody molecules or \"quantum dots.\" Targeted smaller molecules can also be used, instead of antibodies, for example folic acid conjugated with an NIR fluorochrome that provides images of activated macrophages involved in inflammatory joint diseases. These molecules would be directed to  folic acid receptor. Within the group of targeted probes, the antibodies have the advantage of their rapid isolation and that they have a high affinity for virtually any antigen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPor otra parte, diferentes ensayos sistemÃ¡ticos in vivo han proporcionado una confirmaciÃ³n de que el tamaÃ±o es un parÃ¡metro importante en fÃ¡rmaco cinÃ©tica y biodistribuciÃ³n de molÃ©culas de anticuerpos monoclonales. AsÃ­, parece ser que molÃ©culas grandes de IgG (150 kDa) que reconocen antÃ­genos de superficie expresados por las cÃ©lulas tumorales penetran en los tumores sÃ³lidos muy lentamente, con una distribuciÃ³n no uniforme, y tienen una vida media sÃ©rica muy larga [Holliger et al. Nature Biotec. 2005; 23: 1126-36]. Por el contrario, pequeÃ±os fragmentos de anticuerpo de cadena Ãºnica (scFv) monovalentes, con un tamaÃ±o de 25-30 kDa son mucho mÃ¡s eficientes en la penetraciÃ³n al tumor, pero son eliminados demasiado rÃ¡pido y poseen ademÃ¡s una pobre retenciÃ³n en el tumor, debido a sus propiedades de uniÃ³n monovalente. Un anticuerpo ideal para localizar tumores deberÃ­a ser una molÃ©cula multivalente de tamaÃ±o intermedio, que proporcione una penetraciÃ³n mÃ¡s rÃ¡pida en el tumor, una mayor retenciÃ³n en el tejido diana y una eliminaciÃ³n sanguÃ­nea mÃ¡s rÃ¡pida. Estudios recientes indican que anticuerpos bivalentes, tales como los \"diabodies\" (60 kDa), pueden ser mÃ¡s apropiados para las tÃ©cnicas de imagen [Williams et al., 2001; CÃ¡ncer Biother. Radiopharm.; 16:25-35]. Los \"diabodies\" son molÃ©culas dimÃ©ricas no unidas covalentemente, formadas espontÃ¡neamente en formato scFv con espaciadores cortos que conectan la regiÃ³n variable de los genes. Debido a su pequeÃ±o tamaÃ±o, se eliminan rÃ¡pidamente a travÃ©s de los rÃ­Ã±ones, limitando, por tanto, su exposiciÃ³n a la mÃ©dula Ã³sea, que es frecuentemente el Ã³rgano dosis-limitante con los anticuerpos intactos radiomarcados. MolÃ©culas mÃ¡s grandes bivalentes, tales como los \"minibodies\" (dÃ­meros scFv-CH3) y ScFv\n2\n-Fc se pueden acumular en tumores y estos Ãºltimos pueden diseÃ±arse con un espectro amplio de vidas medias en suero, modulando la interacciÃ³n con el receptor FcRn. Los \"minibodies\" pueden ser ideales para localizar tumores, ya que penetran mejor y tienen una eliminaciÃ³n rÃ¡pida con lo que consiguen mejores proporciones tumor-sangre que las inmunoglobulinas intactas (150 kDa) o los fragmentos Fab\n2\n (110 kDa). \n\n Sin embargo, a pesar de los buenos resultados obtenidos con estos formatos en varios modelos [Williams et al, 2001; CÃ¡ncer Biother. Radiopharm.; 16:25-35 y Adams et al, 1998; Br. J. CÃ¡ncer 77:1405-12], aÃºn existen algunas limitaciones que necesitan ser solucionadas con el fin de obtener las mayores ventajas de la capacidad de localizaciÃ³n de estos anticuerpos recombinantes. Una de las limitaciones es su limitada flexibilidad, y, otra, la necesidad de que el segundo antÃ­geno estÃ© orientado de manera precisa en un Ã¡rea estrictamente definida una vez que el anticuerpo se una al primer antÃ­geno. De esta manera, los antÃ­genos unidos deberÃ­an encontrarse casi opuestos al \"diabody\", y en el caso del \"minibody\", en una pequeÃ±a Ã¡rea circular, que, en algunos casos impide la uniÃ³n del segundo antÃ­geno. Esto implica que parte de la afinidad observada depende principalmente de la uniÃ³n y de la capacidad de volverse a unir (\"rebinding\"), y no de la uniÃ³n simultÃ¡nea a diferentes molÃ©culas del antÃ­geno.\nOn the other hand, different systematic tests in vivo have provided confirmation that size is an important parameter in kinetic drug and biodistribution of monoclonal antibody molecules. Thus, it seems that large IgG molecules (150 kDa) that recognize surface antigens expressed by tumor cells penetrate solid tumors very slowly, with a non-uniform distribution, and have a very long serum half-life [Holliger et al. Nature Biotec 2005; 23: 1126-36]. On the contrary, small monovalent single chain antibody (scFv) fragments, with a size of 25-30 kDa are much more efficient in penetrating the tumor, but are removed too quickly and also have poor retention in the tumor, due to to its monovalent binding properties. An ideal antibody to locate tumors should be an intermediate-sized multivalent molecule that provides faster penetration into the tumor, greater retention in the target tissue and faster blood removal. Recent studies indicate that bivalent antibodies, such as \"diabodies\" (60 kDa), may be more appropriate for imaging techniques [Williams et al., 2001; Biother cancer. Radiopharm .; 16: 25-35]. \"Diabodies\" are dimeric molecules not covalently bound, formed spontaneously in scFv format with short spacers that connect the variable region of genes. Due to their small size, they are rapidly removed through the kidneys, thus limiting their exposure to the bone marrow, which is often the dose-limiting organ with radiolabelled intact antibodies. Bivalent larger molecules, such as \"minibodies\" (scFv-CH3 dimers) and ScFv \n2\n -Fc can accumulate in tumors and the latter can be designed with a broad spectrum of serum half-lives, modulating the interaction with the FcRn receptor. The \"minibodies\" can be ideal for locating tumors, since they penetrate better and have a rapid elimination, thus achieving better tumor-blood proportions than intact immunoglobulins (150 kDa) or Fab \n2\n fragments (110 kDa).  However, despite the good results obtained with these formats in several models [Williams et al, 2001; Biother cancer. Radiopharm .; 16: 25-35 and Adams et al, 1998; Br. J. Cancer 77: 1405-12], there are still some limitations that need to be solved in order to obtain the greatest advantages of the ability to localize these recombinant antibodies. One of the limitations is its limited flexibility, and, another, the need for the second antigen to be oriented precisely in a strictly defined area once the antibody binds to the first antigen. In this way, the bound antigens should be almost opposite to the \"diabody\", and in the case of the \"minibody\", in a small circular area, which, in some cases prevents the binding of the second antigen. This implies that part of the affinity observed depends mainly on the binding and on the ability to rejoin (\"rebinding\"), and not on the simultaneous binding to different antigen molecules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExiste, por tanto, la necesidad de desarrollar reactivos para diagnÃ³stico por imagen, basados en anticuerpos, que permitan la detecciÃ³n, visualizaciÃ³n o localizaciÃ³n de una diana de interÃ©s, tal como un antÃ­geno asociado con una alteraciÃ³n patolÃ³gica, que superen la totalidad o parte de los inconvenientes previamente mencionados.\nThere is, therefore, the need to develop reagents for diagnostic imaging, based on antibodies, that allow the detection, visualization or localization of a target of interest, such as an antigen associated with a pathological alteration, that exceed all or part of the previously mentioned inconveniences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCOMPENDIO DE LA INVENCIÃN\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLos inventores han desarrollado un nuevo formato de anticuerpo, en forma de proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica que comprende una pluralidad de proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n, comprendiendo cada proteÃ­na de fusiÃ³n un dominio de uniÃ³n de un anticuerpo o de un fragmento funcionalmente equivalente del mismo, y un dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n, marcada posteriormente con un marcador adecuado para su aplicaciÃ³n en tÃ©cnicas de diagnÃ³stico por imagen. Dichas proteÃ­nas oligomÃ©ricas pueden ser utilizadas para detectar, visualizar o localizar una diana de interÃ©s, tal como un antÃ­geno asociado con una alteraciÃ³n patolÃ³gica.\nThe inventors have developed a new antibody format, in the form of an oligomeric protein comprising a plurality of fusion proteins, each fusion protein comprising a binding domain of an antibody or a functionally equivalent fragment thereof, and an oligomerization domain. , subsequently marked with a marker suitable for application in diagnostic imaging techniques. Said oligomeric proteins can be used to detect, visualize or locate a target of interest, such as an antigen associated with a pathological alteration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEfectivamente, tal y como se ilustra en el Ej emplo 1 , dichas proteÃ­nas oligomÃ©ricas son agentes efectivos para la localizaciÃ³n de depÃ³sitos tumorales in vivo. En una realizaciÃ³n particular, los inventores han generado varias proteÃ­nas trimÃ©ricas, en ocasiones identificadas como \"trimerbodies\", una especÃ­fica frente al hapteno NIP, otra frente al antÃ­geno carcinoembrionario (CEA) humano, y otra que reconoce un epÃ­topo de la laminina asociado a angiogÃ©nesis, y las han caracterizado tanto in vitro como in vivo. \n\n Se ha estudiado en detalle su estabilidad, su especificidad y afinidad y sus propiedades de localizaciÃ³n tumoral, observÃ¡ndose que todas ellas eran multivalentes y poseÃ­an una excelente caracterÃ­stica de uniÃ³n al antÃ­geno, lo que les proporciona una elevada afinidad funcional (avidez). Asimismo, los trimerbodies anti-CEA conjugados quÃ­micamente con un marcador fluorescente mostraron una eficiente localizaciÃ³n del tumor en un modelo experimental de carcinoma colorrectal humano en ratones y los trimerbodies anti- laminina mostraron una localizaciÃ³n excelente en varios tipos de cÃ¡ncer humano, incluyendo fibrosarcomas y carcinomas. Estos resultados demuestran el potencial de este nuevo formato de anticuerpo para aplicaciones terapÃ©uticas y diagnÃ³sticas. Por tanto, en un aspecto, la invenciÃ³n se relaciona con una proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica que comprende una pluralidad de proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n, iguales o diferentes, y un marcador (M), en la que cada proteÃ­na de fusiÃ³n comprende:\nIndeed, as illustrated in Example 1, said oligomeric proteins are effective agents for the location of tumor deposits in vivo. In a particular embodiment, the inventors have generated several trimeric proteins, sometimes identified as \"trimerbodies\", one specific against the NIP hapten, another against the human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and another that recognizes an angiogenesis-associated laminin epitope , and have characterized them both in vitro and in vivo.  Its stability, its specificity and affinity and its tumor localization properties have been studied in detail, observing that all of them were multivalent and possessed an excellent antigen binding characteristic, which gives them a high functional affinity (greediness). Likewise, chemically conjugated anti-CEA trimerbodies showed an efficient tumor localization in an experimental model of human colorectal carcinoma in mice and anti-laminin trimerbodies showed excellent localization in several types of human cancer, including fibrosarcomas and carcinomas . These results demonstrate the potential of this new antibody format for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

Un \"antÃ­geno\", tal como aquÃ­ se utiliza, se refiere a una sustancia que induce la generaciÃ³n de anticuerpos y puede generar una respuesta inmune. Los antÃ­genos, habitualmente, son proteÃ­nas o polisacÃ¡ridos, e incluyen partes de cÃ©lulas, bacterias, virus y otros microorganismos. Atendiendo a su origen, un antÃ­geno puede ser (i) exÃ³geno, es decir, un antÃ­geno que ha entrado en el cuerpo de un sujeto desde el exterior, por ejemplo, mediante inhalaciÃ³n, ingestiÃ³n, inyecciÃ³n, etc.; (ii) endÃ³geno, es decir, un antÃ­geno generado en el interior celular como resultado del metabolismo celular normal o debido a una infecciÃ³n intracelular, e.g., bacteriana, vÃ­rica, etc., incluyendo antÃ­genos xenogÃ©nicos (heterÃ³logos), autÃ³logos e idiomÃ¡ticos o alogÃ©nicos (homÃ³logos); o (iii) autoantÃ­geno, es decir, una proteÃ­na (o un complejo de proteÃ­nas) normal que es reconocida por el sistema inmune de un sujeto que padece una enfermedad autoinmune. Una clase especialmente importante de antÃ­genos tumorales (o neoantÃ­genos), es decir, antÃ­genos que son presentados por molÃ©culas del complejo \n\n mayoritario de histocompatibilidad de tipo I (MHC I) o de tipo II (MHC II) sobre la superficie de cÃ©lulas tumorales; cuando dichos antÃ­genos tumorales son presentados Ãºnicamente por cÃ©lulas tumorales pero no por cÃ©lulas normales se denominan \"antÃ­genos especÃ­ficos de tumor\" (TSA, del inglÃ©s \"tumor-specific antigen\") y, en general, proceden de una mutaciÃ³n especÃ­fica del tumor; alternativamente, los antÃ­genos tumorales que son presentados tanto por cÃ©lulas tumorales como por cÃ©lulas normales se denominan \"antÃ­genos asociados a tumor\" (TAA, del inglÃ©s \"tumor-associated antigen\") y, en general, proceden de una mutaciÃ³n especÃ­fica del tumor.\nAs used herein, the term \"target\" includes a part of a macromolecule that is recognized by an antibody; In a particular embodiment, said target is an antigenic epitope or determinant of an antigen. An \"antigen\", as used herein, refers to a substance that induces the generation of antibodies and can generate an immune response. The antigens are usually proteins or polysaccharides, and include parts of cells, bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms. According to its origin, an antigen can be (i) exogenous, that is, an antigen that has entered the body of a subject from the outside, for example, by inhalation, ingestion, injection, etc .; (ii) endogenous, that is, an antigen generated inside the cell as a result of normal cellular metabolism or due to an intracellular infection, eg, bacterial, viral, etc., including xenogeneic (heterologous), autologous and idiomatic or allogeneic antigens ( homologues); or (iii) autoantigen, that is, a normal protein (or a complex of proteins) that is recognized by the immune system of a subject suffering from an autoimmune disease. An especially important class of tumor antigens (or neoantigens), that is, antigens that are presented by complex molecules  majority of histocompatibility type I (MHC I) or type II (MHC II) on the surface of tumor cells; when these tumor antigens are presented only by tumor cells but not by normal cells, they are called \"tumor-specific antigens\" (TSA) and, in general, they come from a tumor-specific mutation; alternatively, tumor antigens that are presented by both tumor cells and normal cells are called \"tumor associated antigens\" (TAA) and, in general, come from a specific mutation of the tumor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEl tÃ©rmino \"anticuerpo\", tal como aquÃ­ se utiliza, se refiere a una inmunoglobulina, o a un fragmento de la misma, con capacidad de uniÃ³n a un antÃ­geno e incluye todo tipo de anticuerpos, e.g., anticuerpos policlonales, anticuerpos monoclonales, etc., asÃ­ como fragmentos de anticuerpos tales como fragmentos Fab, F(ab')\n2\n, Fab', fragmentos Fv de cadena Ãºnica (scFv, del inglÃ©s single chain Fv), anticuerpos monodominio (V\nHH\n), diabodies, etc. En una realizaciÃ³n particular de la invenciÃ³n, dicho anticuerpo es un fragmento de un anticuerpo, tal como, por ejemplo, un fragmento Fab, F(ab')\n2\n, Fab', scFv o V\nHH\n, los cuales pueden producirse directamente mediante cÃ©lulas hospedadoras recombinantes. En una realizaciÃ³n particular y preferida, el anticuerpo es un scFv.\nThe term \"antibody\", as used herein, refers to an immunoglobulin, or a fragment thereof, capable of binding to an antigen and includes all types of antibodies, eg, polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, etc., as well as antibody fragments such as Fab, F (ab ') \n2\n , Fab' fragments, single chain Fv fragments (scFv), monodomain antibodies (V \nHH\n ), diabodies, etc. In a particular embodiment of the invention, said antibody is a fragment of an antibody, such as, for example, a Fab, F (ab ') \n2\n , Fab', scFv or V \nHH\n fragment, which can be produced directly by host cells recombinant In a particular and preferred embodiment, the antibody is an scFv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nUn fragmento \"Fv\" es un fragmento de anticuerpo mÃ­nimo que contiene un sitio completo de reconocimiento del antÃ­geno y de uniÃ³n al antÃ­geno. Esta regiÃ³n estÃ¡ formada por un dominio variable de una cadena pesada (VH) y un dominio variable de una cadena ligera (VL) asociados no covalentemente.\nAn \"Fv\" fragment is a minimum antibody fragment that contains a complete antigen recognition and antigen binding site. This region is formed by a variable domain of a heavy chain (VH) and a variable domain of a light chain (VL) not covalently associated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLos fragmentos \"scFv\" comprenden los dominios VH y VL de un anticuerpo, formando una cadena polipeptÃ­dica Ãºnica (VH-VL). Preferiblemente, el polipÃ©ptido Fv comprende adicionalmente un polipÃ©ptido conector (linker) entre los dominios VH y VL (VH- linker- VL) que permite al scFv formar la estructura deseada para la uniÃ³n al antÃ­geno. InformaciÃ³n adicional sobre scFv puede encontrarse en \"The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies\", vol. 113, Rosenburg y Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, N. Y., pÃ¡gs. 269-315 (1994).\nThe \"scFv\" fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of an antibody, forming a single polypeptide chain (VH-VL). Preferably, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a linker polypeptide (linker) between the VH and VL domains (VH-linker-VL) that allows the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. Additional information on scFv can be found in \"The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies\", vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, N. Y., p. 269-315 (1994).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEl tÃ©rmino \"diabodies\" se refiere a un fragmento de anticuerpo con dos sitios de uniÃ³n al antÃ­geno, comprendiendo una VH conectada a una VL en la misma cadena polipeptÃ­dica (VH- linker- VL). Mediante el uso de un conector que sea demasiado corto como para permitir el apareamiento entre los dos dominios en la misma cadena, los \n\n dominios son forzados a aparearse con los dominios complementarios de otra cadena, y crear dos sitios de uniÃ³n al antÃ­geno.\nThe term \"diabodies\" refers to an antibody fragment with two antigen binding sites, comprising a VH connected to a VL in the same polypeptide chain (VH-linker-VL). By using a connector that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains in the same chain, the  domains are forced to mate with the complementary domains of another chain, and create two antigen binding sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEl tÃ©rmino \"V\nHH\n\", tal como aquÃ­ se utiliza se refiere anticuerpos monodominio [Nguyen et al, Adv. Immunol. (2001), 79:261-96.; Nguyen et al, Embo J. (2000), 19 (5):921-30.; Sheriff & Constantine, Nat. Struct. Biol. (1996), 3 (9):733-6). En especies de camÃ©lidos (camellos, dromedarios, llamas, etc.) una parte de sus anticuerpos carece de cadena ligera, estando la zona de reconocimiento de los antÃ­genos constituida Ãºnicamente por el dominio VH [Desmyter et al., J. Biol. Chem. (2002), 277 (26):23645- 50]. Este dominio VH se diferencia de los dominios VH de otros anticuerpos en que sus zonas de reconocimiento del antÃ­geno estÃ¡n formadas por bucles de mayor tamaÃ±o. AsÃ­, a los dominios VH de anticuerpos de camÃ©lidos se les denomina V\nHH\n. Este dominio (V\nHH\n) de aproximadamente 15 kDa puede expresarse en el periplasma de E. coli manteniendo la capacidad de uniÃ³n a su antÃ­geno. Los V\nHH\n son molÃ©culas mÃ¡s estables que los scFv, y al contrario que Ã©stos raramente agregan. Al igual que los dominios VL y VH de ratÃ³n, los dominios V\nHH\n poseen un enlace S-S intramolecular que estabiliza su estructura terciaria y es necesario para su correcto plegamiento [Desmyter et al, J. Biol. Chem. (2002), 277 (26):23645-50].\nThe term \"V \nHH\n \", as used herein refers to monodomain antibodies [Nguyen et al, Adv. Immunol (2001), 79: 261-96 .; Nguyen et al, Embo J. (2000), 19 (5): 921-30 .; Sheriff & Constantine, Nat. Struct. Biol. (1996), 3 (9): 733-6). In camelid species (camels, dromedaries, llamas, etc.) a part of their antibodies lacks a light chain, the antigen recognition zone being constituted solely by the VH domain [Desmyter et al., J. Biol. Chem. (2002), 277 (26): 23645-50]. This VH domain differs from the VH domains of other antibodies in that their antigen recognition zones are formed by larger loops. Thus, the VH domains of camelid antibodies are called V \nHH\n . This domain (V \nHH\n ) of approximately 15 kDa can be expressed in the periplasm of E. coli while maintaining its antigen binding capacity. V \nHH\n are more stable molecules than scFv, and unlike they rarely add. Like the mouse VL and VH domains, the V \nHH\n domains possess an intramolecular SS bond that stabilizes their tertiary structure and is necessary for proper folding [Desmyter et al, J. Biol. Chem. (2002), 277 (26 ): 23645-50].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEl tÃ©rmino \"marcador\", tal como aquÃ­ se utiliza, se refiere a cualquier tipo de molÃ©cula que indica la existencia de un proceso quÃ­mico, fÃ­sico o biolÃ³gico, que se puede introducir en un organismo con el fin de examinar alguna propiedad. Los mareajes pueden ser radiactivos o no radiactivos. El mareaje radiactivo o isotÃ³pico se ha empleado con mÃ¡s frecuencia, aunque va siendo desplazado progresivamente por los mÃ©todos no radiactivos. Aunque no existe consenso acerca del mareaje ideal, en la mayorÃ­a de los casos se hace con \n32\nP. Puesto que la corta vida media de este isÃ³topo (14 dÃ­as) crea dificultades en la preparaciÃ³n, comercializaciÃ³n y uso rutinario de los ensayos, se utilizan tambiÃ©n otras alternativas (\n35\nS, \n3\nH, \n125\nI, \n14\nC, etc.). En cuanto a los marcadores no radiactivos, en funciÃ³n del marcador empleado, la detecciÃ³n se hace por fluorometrÃ­a o aÃ±adiendo un sustrato especÃ­fico cuya transformaciÃ³n enzimÃ¡tica por la enzima marcadora puede detectarse por alguno de los siguientes principios: (i) espectrofotometrÃ­a: medida de la absorciÃ³n de luz por los productos de la reacciÃ³n, bien solubles o insolubles, en el ultravioleta o el visible (colorimetrÃ­a), (ii) fluorometrÃ­a: medida de la luz emitida por productos de la reacciÃ³n que poseen un molÃ©cula \n\n fluorescente, o (iii) quimioluminiscencia: medida de luz emitida como consecuencia de reacciones con esta caracterÃ­stica. Estos y otros procedimientos se pueden aplicar a la detecciÃ³n de proteÃ­nas, antÃ­genos o pequeÃ±os ligandos.\nThe term \"marker\", as used herein, refers to any type of molecule that indicates the existence of a chemical, physical or biological process, which can be introduced into an organism in order to examine some property. The tides can be radioactive or non-radioactive. Radioactive or isotopic marking has been used more frequently, although it is progressively displaced by non-radioactive methods. Although there is no consensus on the ideal tide, in most cases it is done with \n32\n P. Since the short half-life of this isotope (14 days) creates difficulties in the preparation, commercialization and routine use of the tests, they are used also other alternatives ( \n35\n S, \n3\n H, \n125\n I, \n14\n C, etc.). As for non-radioactive markers, depending on the marker used, the detection is done by fluorometry or by adding a specific substrate whose enzymatic transformation by the marker enzyme can be detected by any of the following principles: (i) spectrophotometry: absorption measurement of light by reaction products, either soluble or insoluble, in ultraviolet or visible (colorimetry), (ii) fluorometry: measurement of the light emitted by reaction products that possess a molecule  fluorescent, or (iii) chemiluminescence: measure of light emitted as a result of reactions with this characteristic. These and other procedures can be applied to the detection of proteins, antigens or small ligands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEn concreto, la fluorometrÃ­a se puede utilizar para mareaje in vivo. De esta manera, se puede marcar especÃ­ficamente un componente de interÃ©s en una muestra, con una molÃ©cula fluorescente, llamada fluorÃ³foro. Uno de los fluorÃ³ foros mÃ¡s comÃºnmente utilizados es la fluoresceÃ­na isotiocianato (FITC), un reactivo derivado de la fluoresceÃ­na, que se acopla quÃ­micamente a otras molÃ©culas para crear nuevas molÃ©culas fluorescentes para una variedad de aplicaciones. Otros fluorÃ³foros histÃ³ricamente muy utilizados son los derivados de la rodamina (TRITC), comarina y cianina. Nuevas generaciones de fluorÃ³foros incluyen el \"Alexa Fluor\" y los \"DyLight Fluor\", mÃ¡s fotoestables, mÃ¡s brillantes y menos sensibles a cambios de pH que otros marcadores conocidos. Dentro de la familia de la cianina, se incluyen los marcadores Cy3, Cy5, Cy5.5 y Cy7, que son reactivos fluorescentes solubles en agua. Los marcadores Cy3 son amarillo -naranja (excitaciÃ³n a 550 nm aproximadamente, emisiÃ³n a aproximadamente 570 nm), mientras que los Cy5 son fluorescentes en la regiÃ³n del rojo (aproximadamente a 650/670 nm). Normalmente son sintetizados con grupos reactivos en una o en ambas cadenas laterales de nitrÃ³geno, de manera que pueden ser acoplados quÃ­micamente, tanto a Ã¡cidos nucleicos como a proteÃ­nas, siendo ampliamente usados en tÃ©cnicas de diagnÃ³stico por imagen. Por otra parte, dentro de los fluorÃ³foros orgÃ¡nicos para el infrarrojo cercano (NIR), los mÃ¡s comunes son las polimetinas de fÃ³rmula general (I)\nSpecifically, fluorometry can be used for in vivo marking. In this way, a component of interest can be specifically labeled in a sample, with a fluorescent molecule, called fluorophore. One of the most commonly used fluorinated forums is fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), a reagent derived from fluorescein, which chemically attaches to other molecules to create new fluorescent molecules for a variety of applications. Other historically widely used fluorophores are rhodamine derivatives (TRITC), comarin and cyanine. New generations of fluorophores include the \"Alexa Fluor\" and the \"DyLight Fluor\", more photostable, brighter and less sensitive to pH changes than other known markers. Within the cyanine family, the Cy3, Cy5, Cy5.5 and Cy7 markers are included, which are water soluble fluorescent reagents. Cy3 markers are yellow-orange (excitation at approximately 550 nm, emission at approximately 570 nm), while Cy5 are fluorescent in the red region (approximately 650/670 nm). They are normally synthesized with reactive groups in one or both side chains of nitrogen, so that they can be chemically coupled to both nucleic acids and proteins, being widely used in diagnostic imaging techniques. On the other hand, within the organic fluorophores for near infrared (NIR), the most common are polymetins of general formula (I)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n(I) \n\n donde\n(I)  where\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRi y R\n2\n, independientemente entre sÃ­, representan alquilo C\n1\n-C\n10\n, sulfoalquilo\nRi and R \n2\n independently represent C \n1\n -C \n10,\n sulphoalkyl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nC1-C10, cicloalquilo C\n3\n-C\n10\n, alcoxilo C\n1\n-C\n10\n, o arilo;\nC1-C10, cycloalkyl C \n3\n -C \n10,\n alkoxyl C \n1\n -C \n10\n -alkyl, or aryl;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nR\n3\n y R\n4\n, independientemente entre sÃ­, representan sulfoalquilo C\n1\n-C\n10\n, haloalquilo C\n1\n-C\n10\n, o hidroxicarbonilalquilo C\n1\n-C\n10\n;\nR \n3\n and R \n4\n independently represent sulfoalkyl \nC1\n - \nC10,\n \nC1\n - \nC10\n haloalkyl, or \nC1\n - \nC10\n hydroxycarbonyl;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nY es C, O, S; y n es un nÃºmero entero comprendido entre 1 y 10.\nY is C, O, S; and n is an integer between 1 and 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEntre las polimetinas mÃ¡s Ãºtiles se encuentran las cianinas pentametina (n = 1) y heptametina (n= 2) que comprenden un grupo benzoxazol, benzotiazol, indolil, 2- quino lin Ã³ 4-quinolin.\nAmong the most useful polymethines are the cyanines pentametin (n = 1) and heptametin (n = 2) comprising a benzoxazole, benzothiazole, indolyl, 2- quino lin or 4-quinolin group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nProteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n\nOligomeric protein of the invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEn otro aspecto, la invenciÃ³n se relaciona con una proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica, en adelante proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n, que comprende una pluralidad de proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n, iguales o diferentes, y un marcador (M), en la que cada proteÃ­na de fusiÃ³n comprende:\nIn another aspect, the invention relates to an oligomeric protein, hereinafter oligomeric protein of the invention, comprising a plurality of fusion proteins, the same or different, and a label (M), wherein each fusion protein comprises:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n(a) un polipÃ©ptido (A) que comprende un anticuerpo o un fragmento funcionalmente equivalente de dicho anticuerpo; y\n(a) a polypeptide (A) comprising an antibody or a functionally equivalent fragment of said antibody; Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n(b) un polipÃ©ptido (B) que comprende un dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n. El marcador (M) presente en dicha proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n puede ser prÃ¡cticamente cualquier marcador; no obstante, para sus aplicaciones en tÃ©cnicas de diagnÃ³stico por imagen dicho marcador (M) es un marcador adecuado para dichas tÃ©cnicas, por ejemplo, (i) un fluorÃ³foro, tal como un fluorÃ³foro para diagnÃ³stico por imagen por fluorescencia en la zona cercana al infrarrojo, e.g. Cy5, Cy7 etc.; (ii) un radionucleido para radioinmunoescintigrafÃ­a [compuestos que emiten partÃ­culas gamma: 99mTc, \n111\nIn, \n131\nI, renio 186 (\n186\nRe)] o para tomografÃ­a por emisiÃ³n de positrones (TEP) (marcador TEP); etc. En una realizaciÃ³n particular, dicho marcador (M) es un fluorÃ³ro, tal como Cy5, Cy7, etc., o un marcador TEP, tal como \n64\nCu, \n68\nGa, \n18\nF, \n86\nY, \n76\nBr, \n89\nZr, \n124\nI, etc. En general, el uso en clÃ­nica humana de anticuerpos recombinantes con fines diagnÃ³stico requiere el empleo de marcadores tipo TEP (\"inmuno-TEP\"), los cuales, por sus caracterÃ­sticas, permitirÃ¡n detectar lesiones pequeÃ±as, incluyendo micrometÃ¡stasis, \n\n localizadas en zonas profundas; alternativamente, para detectar lesiones mÃ¡s superficiales, se podrÃ­an utilizar fluorÃ³foros, e.g., marcadores fluorescentes NIR, en localizaciones mÃ¡s accesibles, por ejemplo, piel, fondo de ojo, etc. [Wu & Olafsen. CÃ¡ncer J. (2008). May-Jun; 14(3):191-7; van Dongen GA et al. (2007). Oncologist. Dec; 12(12):1379-89.\n(b) a polypeptide (B) comprising an oligomerization domain. The marker (M) present in said oligomeric protein of the invention can be practically any marker; however, for its applications in diagnostic imaging techniques, said marker (M) is a suitable marker for said techniques, for example, (i) a fluorophore, such as a fluorophore for imaging by fluorescence in the near-infrared area , eg Cy5, Cy7 etc .; (ii) a radionuclide for radioimmunoscintigraphy [compounds that emit gamma particles: 99mTc, \n111\n In, \n131\n I, rhenium 186 ( \n186\n Re)] or for positron emission tomography (PET) (PET marker); etc. In a particular embodiment, said marker (M) is a fluorophore, such as Cy5, Cy7, etc., or a PET marker, such as \n64\n Cu, \n68\n Ga, \n18\n F, \n86\n Y, \n76\n Br, \n89\n Zr, \n124\n I , etc. In general, the use in clinical practice of recombinant antibodies for diagnostic purposes requires the use of markers type TEP (\"immuno-TEP\"), which, due to their characteristics, will allow to detect small lesions, including micrometastases,  located in deep areas; alternatively, to detect more superficial lesions, fluorophores, eg, NIR fluorescent markers, could be used in more accessible locations, for example, skin, fundus, etc. [Wu & Olafsen. Cancer J. (2008). May-Jun; 14 (3): 191-7; van Dongen GA et al. (2007). Oncologist Dec; 12 (12): 1379-89.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n comprende una pluralidad de proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n, iguales o diferentes, y un marcador (M), comprendiendo cada una de dichas proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n comprende un polipÃ©ptido (A) que comprende un anticuerpo o un fragmento funcionalmente equivalente de dicho anticuerpo; y un polipÃ©ptido (B) que comprende un dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n.\nThe oligomeric protein of the invention comprises a plurality of fusion proteins, the same or different, and a marker (M), each of said fusion proteins comprising a polypeptide (A) comprising an antibody or a functionally equivalent fragment of said antibody; and a polypeptide (B) comprising an oligomerization domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEn una realizaciÃ³n particular, dicha proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n comprende una pluralidad de proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n iguales; en cuyo caso, cada una de dichas proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n comprende un mismo polipÃ©ptido (A) que comprende un anticuerpo o un fragmento funcionalmente equivalente de dicho anticuerpo; y un mismo polipÃ©ptido (B) que comprende un dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n.\nIn a particular embodiment, said oligomeric protein of the invention comprises a plurality of equal fusion proteins; in which case, each of said fusion proteins comprises the same polypeptide (A) comprising an antibody or a functionally equivalent fragment of said antibody; and the same polypeptide (B) comprising an oligomerization domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEn otra realizaciÃ³n particular, dicha proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n comprende una pluralidad de proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n diferentes, por ejemplo, dos o mÃ¡s proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n diferentes. En este caso, una de dichas proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n comprende un polipÃ©ptido (Al) que comprende un anticuerpo (1) o un fragmento funcionalmente equivalente de dicho anticuerpo (1); y un polipÃ©ptido (B) que comprende un dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n, y otra de dichas proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n comprende un polipÃ©ptido (A2) que comprende un anticuerpo (2) o un fragmento funcionalmente equivalente de dicho anticuerpo (2); y un polipÃ©ptido (B) que comprende un dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n, en donde dichos anticuerpos (1) y (2) son diferentes. El nÃºmero total de proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n presentes en la proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n dependerÃ¡ del dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n, dependiendo del dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n siendo posible prÃ¡cticamente cualquier combinaciÃ³n entre dichas proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n iguales o diferentes, siempre y cuando el dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n se mantenga. El hecho de que la proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n comprenda dos o mÃ¡s proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n diferentes permite reconocer e interaccionar con dos o mÃ¡s dianas (e.g., antÃ­genos) diferentes. \n\n A modo ilustrativo, no limitativo, la proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n puede contener dos proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n diferentes entre sÃ­, tal como se ha mencionado previamente; o, alternativamente, dos proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n iguales entre sÃ­ y una proteÃ­na de fusiÃ³n diferente; o, alternativamente, dos proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n iguales entre sÃ­ y otros dos proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n diferentes pero iguales entre sÃ­; o, alternativamente, dos proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n iguales entre sÃ­ y otros dos proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n diferentes entre sÃ­ y diferentes a las dos proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n iguales; o, alternativamente, tres proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n diferentes entre sÃ­; etc.; en general, cualquier combinaciÃ³n de proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n que comprendan un polipÃ©ptido (A) que comprende un anticuerpo o un fragmento funcionalmente equivalente de dicho anticuerpo, y un polipÃ©ptido (B) que comprende un dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n, en las que se mantenga dicho dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n.\nIn another particular embodiment, said oligomeric protein of the invention comprises a plurality of different fusion proteins, for example, two or more different fusion proteins. In this case, one of said fusion proteins comprises a polypeptide (Al) comprising an antibody (1) or a functionally equivalent fragment of said antibody (1); and a polypeptide (B) comprising an oligomerization domain, and another one of said fusion proteins comprises a polypeptide (A2) comprising an antibody (2) or a functionally equivalent fragment of said antibody (2); and a polypeptide (B) comprising an oligomerization domain, wherein said antibodies (1) and (2) are different. The total number of fusion proteins present in the oligomeric protein of the invention will depend on the oligomerization domain, depending on the oligomerization domain being possible virtually any combination between said same or different fusion proteins, as long as the oligomerization domain is maintained. The fact that the oligomeric protein of the invention comprises two or more different fusion proteins allows to recognize and interact with two or more different targets (eg, antigens).  By way of illustration, not limitation, the oligomeric protein of the invention may contain two different fusion proteins, as previously mentioned; or, alternatively, two fusion proteins equal to each other and a different fusion protein; or, alternatively, two fusion proteins equal to each other and two other fusion proteins different but equal to each other; or, alternatively, two fusion proteins equal to each other and two other fusion proteins different from each other and different from the two same fusion proteins; or, alternatively, three different fusion proteins from each other; etc.; in general, any combination of fusion proteins comprising a polypeptide (A) comprising an antibody or a functionally equivalent fragment of said antibody, and a polypeptide (B) comprising an oligomerization domain, in which said domain is maintained. oligomerization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n comprende dos o mÃ¡s proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n, iguales o diferentes; por tanto, puede reconocer e interaccionar con una Ãºnica diana (antÃ­geno), o, alternativamente, con dos o mÃ¡s dianas (e.g., antÃ­genos) diferentes, lo que la convierte en un reactivo muy versÃ¡til monoespecÃ­fico (es decir, cuando reconoce a una Ãºnica diana o antÃ­geno), o multiespecÃ­fico (es decir, cuando reconoce a mÃ¡s de una diana o antÃ­geno, e.g., biespecÃ­fico, si reconoce dos dianas o antÃ­genos diferentes, triespecÃ­ficos, si reconoce tres dianas o antÃ­genos diferentes, etc. El polipÃ©ptido (A) comprende un anticuerpo o un fragmento funcionalmente equivalente de dicho anticuerpo. Dicho anticuerpo, o fragmento funcionalmente equivalente, reconoce una diana, tal como un epÃ­topo o determinante antigÃ©nico de un antÃ­geno; en una realizaciÃ³n particular, dicho antÃ­geno es un antÃ­geno tumoral, tal como CEA (Begent RH et al. Nat Med. (1996) Sep; 2(9):979-84), o un antÃ­geno no tumoral que se expresa en Ã¡reas de angiogÃ©nesis activas en el microambiente peritumoral, tal como el dominio EDB de la fibronectina (Ebbinghaus C et al. Curr Pharm Des. (2004); 10(13):1537-49).\nThe oligomeric protein of the invention comprises two or more fusion proteins, the same or different; therefore, it can recognize and interact with a single target (antigen), or, alternatively, with two or more different targets (eg, antigens), which makes it a very versatile monospecific reagent (that is, when it recognizes a single target or antigen), or multispecific (that is, when it recognizes more than one target or antigen, eg, bispecific, if it recognizes two different targets or antigens, triespecific, if it recognizes three different targets or antigens, etc. The polypeptide (A) it comprises an antibody or a functionally equivalent fragment of said antibody, said antibody, or functionally equivalent fragment, recognizes a target, such as an antigenic epitope or determinant of an antigen; in a particular embodiment, said antigen is a tumor antigen, such as CEA (Begent RH et al. Nat Med. (1996) Sep; 2 (9): 979-84), or a non-tumor antigen that is expressed in areas of active angiogenesis in the peritumoral microenvironment, such as or the EDB domain of fibronectin (Ebbinghaus C et al. Curr Pharm Des. (2004); 10 (13): 1537-49).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEn una realizaciÃ³n particular, el polipÃ©ptido (A) comprende un anticuerpo que reconoce una diana o un fragmento funcionalmente equivalente de dicho anticuerpo que reconoce dicha diana. PrÃ¡cticamente cualquier anticuerpo, o fragmento funcionalmente equivalente del mismo, que reconozca una diana puede ser utilizado en la presente invenciÃ³n, por ejemplo, un anticuerpo monoclonal (AcM) o un anticuerpo policlonal \n\n (AcP); alternativamente, dicho polipÃ©ptido (A) puede contener un fragmento funcionalmente equivalente de un anticuerpo, tal como un fragmento de anticuerpo que mantiene la capacidad de reconocimiento de la diana reconocida por el anticuerpo completo del que deriva, e.g., un scFv, un anticuerpo biespecÃ­fico o diabody que reconoce dicha diana o bien en su formato recombinante completo (Fab + Fc), o un anticuerpo monodominio V\nHH\n preferentemente, un scFv (Ejemplo 1).\nIn a particular embodiment, the polypeptide (A) comprises an antibody that recognizes a target or a functionally equivalent fragment of said antibody that recognizes said target.

Las proteÃ­nas oligomÃ©ricas de la invenciÃ³n poseen una seÃ±al de uniÃ³n mayor que el anticuerpo monomÃ©rico (que constituye una unidad estructural de la misma) y, aparentemente, una disociaciÃ³n menor, consistente con la uniÃ³n multivalente al antÃ­geno. De hecho, se ha calculado que una proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n (e.g., la proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica anti-NIP - Ejemplo 1) tiene una afinidad funcional por el antÃ­geno muy superior (NIP-BSA) unas 100 veces mayor que su versiÃ³n monovalente. Este resultado sugiere, aunque no se desea estar vinculado por ninguna teorÃ­a, que esta ganancia de afinidad podrÃ­a ser debida al efecto de avidez de un segundo sitio de combinaciÃ³n en la molÃ©cula de la proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n. La presencia de al menos dos sitios de uniÃ³n funcionales en una sola molÃ©cula de una proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n ha sido posteriormente demostrada mediante la generaciÃ³n de proteÃ­nas de oligomÃ©ricas de la invenciÃ³n biespecÃ­ficas (Ejemplos 1); efectivamente, proteÃ­nas oligomÃ©ricas (trimerbodies) biespecÃ­ficas anti-laminina y anti-NIP estables fueron fÃ¡cilmente producidos por co-expresiÃ³n de dos construcciones diferentes de proteÃ­nas oligomÃ©ricas de la invenciÃ³n en cÃ©lulas humanas.\nThe oligomeric proteins of the invention can be isolated and, if desired, easily purified, by conventional methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by affinity chromatography. In general, the oligomeric protein of the invention is oligomeric in solution and possesses excellent stability and binding capacity to the target (antigen), recognizing with high efficiency both  purified antigens immobilized on a plaque as antigens expressed or overexpressed in pathological alterations (eg, on the surface of a tumor cell). The oligomeric proteins of the invention possess a greater binding signal than the monomeric antibody (which constitutes a structural unit thereof) and, apparently, a smaller dissociation, consistent with the multivalent binding to the antigen. In fact, it has been calculated that an oligomeric protein of the invention (eg, the anti-NIP oligomeric protein - Example 1) has a much higher functional affinity for the antigen (NIP-BSA) about 100 times greater than its monovalent version. This result suggests, although it is not desired to be bound by any theory, that this affinity gain could be due to the avidity effect of a second combination site in the oligomeric protein molecule of the invention. The presence of at least two functional binding sites in a single molecule of an oligomeric protein of the invention has subsequently been demonstrated by the generation of bispecific oligomeric proteins of the invention (Examples 1); indeed, stable anti-laminin and anti-NIP bispecific oligomeric proteins (trimerbodies) were easily produced by co-expression of two different oligomeric protein constructs of the invention in human cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEsta ganancia en afinidad a travÃ©s de la avidez convierte a las proteÃ­nas oligomÃ©ricas de la invenciÃ³n en unos reactivos muy atractivos para tÃ©cnicas de imagen in vzvo como agentes alternativos, y preferidos, a los anticuerpos dimÃ©ricos (diabodies y minibodies). Como es conocido, para una completa avidez en anticuerpos multivalentes dirigidos a molÃ©culas unidas a la superficie, los sitios de uniÃ³n del antÃ­geno deben apuntar hacia la misma direcciÃ³n; si la uniÃ³n mÃºltiple simultÃ¡nea no es posible estÃ©ricamente, entonces la ganancia aparente en afinidad funcional es probable que sea menor y debida Ãºnicamente al efecto de uniÃ³n aumentado, que es dependiente en tasas de difusiÃ³n y la concentraciÃ³n del antÃ­geno de superficie. El anÃ¡lisis del modelo de las proteÃ­nas oligomÃ©ricas de la invenciÃ³n, en particular en su formato trimÃ©rico (trimerbody), sugiere una estructura con forma de trÃ­pode con los dominios scFv orientados hacia fuera. La flexibilidad entre los sitios de uniÃ³n al antÃ­geno es otro aspecto importante en el diseÃ±o de anticuerpos multivalentes, requeridos para el entrecruzamiento de receptores de superficie, bien en la misma cÃ©lula o en adyacentes. En este sentido, el espaciador flexible presente en algunas realizaciones particulares de \n\n esta invenciÃ³n permite numerosas geometrÃ­as de uniÃ³n. Cuando una interacciÃ³n antÃ­geno-anticuerpo ocurre, la posibilidad de establecer una segunda interacciÃ³n depende de la valencia, orientaciÃ³n y flexibilidad del sitio de uniÃ³n del antÃ­geno. SegÃºn los cÃ¡lculos de los inventores, en una molÃ©cula de una proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n, tal como un trÃ­mero (trimerbody), los scFv que permanecen sin interaccionar tienen un Ã¡rea de influencia unas 1 1 veces mayor, aproximadamente, que otros formatos bivalentes, tales como los diabodies y los minibodies, aumentando la probabilidad de una segunda interacciÃ³n efectiva. La flexibilidad de las proteÃ­nas oligomÃ©ricas de la invenciÃ³n constituye tambiÃ©n una ventaja frente a otras estructuras mÃ¡s compactas o rÃ­gidas de otros formatos (e.g., collabody), ya que aumenta la accesibilidad de los scFv, que es un parÃ¡metro crÃ­tico para la localizaciÃ³n de las dianas in vivo.\nThis affinity gain through avidity makes the oligomeric proteins of the invention very attractive reagents for in vzvo imaging techniques as alternative, and preferred, agents to dimeric antibodies (diabodies and minibodies). As is known, for a complete avidity in multivalent antibodies directed to surface bound molecules, the antigen binding sites must point in the same direction; If simultaneous multiple binding is not sterically possible, then the apparent gain in functional affinity is likely to be less and due solely to the increased binding effect, which is dependent on diffusion rates and the concentration of the surface antigen. The analysis of the oligomeric protein model of the invention, particularly in its trimeric format, suggests a tripod-shaped structure with the scFv domains oriented outward. Flexibility between antigen binding sites is another important aspect in the design of multivalent antibodies, required for cross-linking of surface receptors, either in the same cell or in adjacent ones. In this sense, the flexible spacer present in some particular embodiments of  This invention allows numerous joining geometries. When an antigen-antibody interaction occurs, the possibility of establishing a second interaction depends on the valence, orientation and flexibility of the antigen binding site. According to the calculations of the inventors, in a molecule of an oligomeric protein of the invention, such as a trimer (trimerbody), scFv that remain un interacting have an area of influence approximately 1 1 times, approximately, than other bivalent formats, such as diabodies and minibodies, increasing the likelihood of a second effective interaction. The flexibility of the oligomeric proteins of the invention is also an advantage over other more compact or rigid structures of other formats (eg, collabody), since it increases the accessibility of scFv, which is a critical parameter for target location. in vivo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPor tanto, la multimerizaciÃ³n de las construcciones scFv presenta numerosas ventajas para las aplicaciones in vivo frente a otros anticuerpos recombinantes (diabodies y minibodies) que han mostrado su potencial como agentes de localizaciÃ³n in vivo. Las proteÃ­nas oligomÃ©ricas de la invenciÃ³n son molÃ©culas multivalentes de tamaÃ±o intermedio que presentan una alta estabilidad en condiciones fisiolÃ³gicas. El potencial de dichas proteÃ­nas oligomÃ©ricas de la invenciÃ³n, en particular de unos trÃ­meros (trimerbodies) para la localizaciÃ³n in vivo se ha estudiado en modelos experimentales de cÃ¡ncer humano en ratones desnudos (Ejemplo 1). En otro aspecto, la invenciÃ³n se relaciona con un kit que comprende una proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n. El empleo de dicho kit para la detecciÃ³n, visualizaciÃ³n o localizaciÃ³n de una diana, e.g., un antÃ­geno, mediante una tÃ©cnica apropiada, por ejemplo, una tÃ©cnica de imagen. En una realizaciÃ³n particular dicha diana es un antÃ­geno que se expresa de novo o se sobreexpresa en una alteraciÃ³n patolÃ³gica, por ejemplo, en patologÃ­as inflamatorias, vasculares, tumorales, etc. En una realizaciÃ³n particular, dicha diana es un antÃ­geno tumoral.\nTherefore, the multimerization of scFv constructs has numerous advantages for in vivo applications over other recombinant antibodies (diabodies and minibodies) that have shown their potential as in vivo localization agents. The oligomeric proteins of the invention are intermediate sized multivalent molecules that exhibit high stability under physiological conditions. The potential of said oligomeric proteins of the invention, in particular trimer (trimerbodies) for in vivo localization has been studied in experimental models of human cancer in nude mice (Example 1). In another aspect, the invention relates to a kit comprising an oligomeric protein of the invention. The use of said kit for the detection, visualization or localization of a target, e.g., an antigen, by an appropriate technique, for example, an imaging technique. In a particular embodiment said target is an antigen that expresses de novo or is overexpressed in a pathological alteration, for example, in inflammatory, vascular, tumor pathologies, etc. In a particular embodiment, said target is a tumor antigen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEl kit de la invenciÃ³n es un producto que contiene los diferentes productos (e.g., proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n, reactivos adicionales, etc.) formando la composiciÃ³n empaquetada de modo que permita su transporte, almacenamiento y su empleo.

Additionally, if desired, said fusion protein may include a polypeptide (C) comprising the amino acid sequence of a flexible binding peptide between said polypeptides (A) and (B) and / or a peptide (D) to facilitate the isolation or purification of the fusion protein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLas caracterÃ­sticas de dichos polipÃ©ptidos (A), (B), (C) y (D) ya han sido descritas previamente, al igual que la posibilidad de que dichas proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n sean iguales o diferentes.\nThe characteristics of said polypeptides (A), (B), (C) and (D) have already been described previously, as well as the possibility that said fusion proteins are the same or different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa proteÃ­na de fusiÃ³n proporcionada por la invenciÃ³n puede ser obtenida por mÃ©todos convencionales. A modo ilustrativo, dicha pro teÃ­na de fusiÃ³n puede obtenerse mediante la fusiÃ³n de dichos polipÃ©ptidos, obtenidos bien por mÃ©todos de sÃ­ntesis quÃ­mica de pÃ©ptidos o bien mediante la tecnologÃ­a del ADN recombinante. Alternativamente, dicha proteÃ­na de fusiÃ³n proporcionada por esta invenciÃ³n puede obtenerse por mediante el empleo de la tecnologÃ­a del ADN recombinante, para lo cual se generarÃ¡n las construcciones gÃ©nicas, cassettes de expresiÃ³n y vectores \n\n correspondientes. En general, cuando las proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n son iguales, pueden obtenerse mediante incorporaciÃ³n del ADN que codifica dicha proteÃ­na de fusiÃ³n en una cÃ©lula huÃ©sped apropiada (e.g., bacterias, levaduras, cÃ©lulas animales, etc.). Alternativamente, cuando las proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n son diferentes, pueden obtenerse, en general, mediante incorporaciÃ³n de los ADN que codifican dichas proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n en una cÃ©lula huÃ©sped apropiada, en donde los distintos ADN pueden formar parte de la misma construcciÃ³n gÃ©nica o de construcciones gÃ©nicas diferentes (e.g., mediante co- transformaciÃ³n o co-transfecciÃ³n de cÃ©lulas huÃ©sped apropiadas).\nThe fusion protein provided by the invention can be obtained by conventional methods. By way of illustration, said fusion protein can be obtained by fusion of said polypeptides, obtained either by chemical peptide synthesis methods or by recombinant DNA technology. Alternatively, said fusion protein provided by this invention can be obtained through the use of recombinant DNA technology, for which gene constructs, expression cassettes and vectors will be generated.  corresponding. In general, when the fusion proteins are the same, they can be obtained by incorporating the DNA encoding said fusion protein into an appropriate host cell (eg, bacteria, yeasts, animal cells, etc.). Alternatively, when the fusion proteins are different, they can be obtained, in general, by incorporating the DNAs encoding said fusion proteins into an appropriate host cell, where the different DNAs can be part of the same gene construct or gene constructs different (eg, by co-transformation or co-transfection of appropriate host cells).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPor tanto, en otro aspecto, la invenciÃ³n se relaciona con una construcciÃ³n gÃ©nica, en adelante construcciÃ³n gÃ©nica de la invenciÃ³n, que comprende, al menos: a) una primera secuencia de Ã¡cido nucleico (A'), que comprende la secuencia de nucleÃ³tidos que codifica un polipÃ©ptido (A), en donde dicho polipÃ©ptido (A) comprende un anticuerpo o un fragmento funcionalmente equivalente de dicho anticuerpo; y b) una segunda secuencia de Ã¡cido nucleico (B') que codifica un polipÃ©ptido (B) que comprende un dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n, en donde el extremo 3' de dicha primera secuencia de Ã¡cido nucleico (A') estÃ¡ unido al extremo 5' de dicha segunda secuencia de Ã¡cido nucleico (B'), o, alternativamente, el extremo 5 ' de dicha primera secuencia de Ã¡cido nucleico (A') estÃ¡ unido al extremo 3 ' de dicha segunda secuencia de Ã¡cido nucleico (B').\nTherefore, in another aspect, the invention relates to a gene construct, hereinafter referred to as the gene construct of the invention, comprising at least: a) a first nucleic acid sequence (A '), which comprises the nucleotide sequence that encodes a polypeptide (A), wherein said polypeptide (A) comprises an antibody or a functionally equivalent fragment of said antibody; and b) a second nucleic acid sequence (B ') encoding a polypeptide (B) comprising an oligomerization domain, wherein the 3' end of said first nucleic acid sequence (A ') is attached to the 5' end of said second nucleic acid sequence (B '), or, alternatively, the 5' end of said first nucleic acid sequence (A ') is attached to the 3' end of said second nucleic acid sequence (B ').\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa secuencia de Ã¡cido nucleico (A') comprende la secuencia de nucleÃ³tidos que codifica un polipÃ©ptido (A) que comprende un anticuerpo que reconoce una diana o un fragmento funcionalmente equivalente de dicho anticuerpo que reconoce dicha diana. Ejemplos ilustrativos de dicha diana incluyen un epÃ­topo o determinante antigÃ©nico de un antÃ­geno, por ejemplo, un antÃ­geno que se expresa de novo o se sobreexpresa en una alteraciÃ³n patolÃ³gica, por ejemplo, en patologÃ­as inflamatorias, vasculares, tumorales, etc. En una realizaciÃ³n particular, dicha diana es un antÃ­geno tumoral.\nThe nucleic acid sequence (A ') comprises the nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide (A) comprising an antibody that recognizes a target or a functionally equivalent fragment of said antibody that recognizes said target. Illustrative examples of said target include an antigenic epitope or determinant of an antigen, for example, an antigen that is expressed de novo or overexpressed in a pathological alteration, for example, in inflammatory, vascular, tumor pathologies, etc. In a particular embodiment, said target is a tumor antigen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPor tanto, en una realizaciÃ³n particular, la secuencia de Ã¡cido nucleico (A') codifica un polipÃ©ptido (A) que comprende un anticuerpo, o un fragmento funcionalmente equivalente del mismo, que reconoce una diana concreta. PrÃ¡cticamente cualquier anticuerpo, o fragmento funcionalmente equivalente del mismo, que reconozca una diana puede ser utilizado en la presente invenciÃ³n, e.g., un AcM, un AcP, \n\n un scFv, un anticuerpo biespecÃ­fico o diabody, un V\nHH\n, etc. En una realizaciÃ³n particular, dicha secuencia de Ã¡cido nucleico (A') codifica un polipÃ©ptido (A) que comprende un scFv recombinante derivado del AcM L36 anti-laminina [scFv L36], o un scFv recombinante derivado del AcM Bl.8 especÃ­fico del hapteno NIP, o un scFv recombinante derivado del AcM MFE23 especÃ­fico del antÃ­geno carcinoembrionario (CEA) humano (Ejemplo 1).\nThus, in a particular embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence (A ') encodes a polypeptide (A) comprising an antibody, or a functionally equivalent fragment thereof, that recognizes a specific target. Virtually any antibody, or functionally equivalent fragment thereof, that recognizes a target can be used in the present invention, eg, an AcM, an AcP,  a scFv, a bispecific antibody or diabody, a V \nHH\n , etc. In a particular embodiment, said nucleic acid sequence (A ') encodes a polypeptide (A) comprising a recombinant scFv derived from the anti-laminin L36 AcM [scFv L36], or a hapten-specific recombinant scMv derived from the AcM Bl.8 NIP, or a recombinant scFv derived from the ACM MFE23 specific to the human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (Example 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEn caso de que la proteÃ­na oligomÃ©rica de la invenciÃ³n comprenda una pluralidad de proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n diferentes, por ejemplo, dos o mÃ¡s proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n diferentes, cada una de ellas estarÃ­a codificada por la correspondiente secuencia de ADN, las cuales podrÃ­an estar en una Ãºnica construcciÃ³n gÃ©nica o en construcciones gÃ©nicas diferentes.\nIn case the oligomeric protein of the invention comprises a plurality of different fusion proteins, for example, two or more different fusion proteins, each of them would be encoded by the corresponding DNA sequence, which could be in a single gene construct or in different gene constructs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa secuencia de Ã¡cido nucleico (B') comprende la secuencia de nucleÃ³tidos que codifica un polipÃ©ptido (B) que comprende un dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n. Como se ha mencionado previamente, un dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n permite la formaciÃ³n de oligÃ³meros (e.g., dÃ­meros, trÃ­meros, tetrÃ¡meros, etc., de pÃ©ptidos o proteÃ­nas). PrÃ¡cticamente cualquier dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n, por ejemplo, un dominio de dimerizaciÃ³n, trimerizaciÃ³n, tetramerizaciÃ³n, etc., presente en distintas proteÃ­nas, tanto de origen eucariÃ³tico como procariÃ³tico, susceptible de ser expresado de forma recombinante y de formar un oligÃ³mero proteico de la proteÃ­na que lo comprende puede ser utilizado en la presente invenciÃ³n. En una realizaciÃ³n particular, dicho dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n es un dominio de trimerizaciÃ³n, tal como el dominio de trimerizaciÃ³n del dominio NCl de colÃ¡geno XVIII o del colÃ¡geno XV; en una realizaciÃ³n concreta, dicho dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n es el dominio de trimerizaciÃ³n del dominio NCl de colÃ¡geno XVIII o del colÃ¡geno XV al que se la ha eliminado la totalidad o parte del dominio de ES. Por tanto, en una realizaciÃ³n particular y preferida, la secuencia de Ã¡cido nucleico (B') comprende la secuencia de nucleÃ³tidos que codifica el dominio NCl de colÃ¡geno XVIII de mamÃ­fero o el dominio NCl del colÃ¡geno XV de mamÃ­fero, en el que, opcionalmente, se ha eliminado la totalidad o parte del dominio de ES. Las secuencias de dichos dominios NCl de colÃ¡geno XV y XVIII son conocidas; a modo ilustrativo, la secuencia del dominio NC l del colÃ¡geno XVIII ha sido descrita previamente por Sasaki et al. [Sasaki et al. Structure, function and tissue forms of the C- \n\n terminal globular domain of collagen XVIII containing the angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin. EMBO J. 1998 Aug 3;17(15):4249-56].\nThe nucleic acid sequence (B ') comprises the nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide (B) comprising an oligomerization domain. As previously mentioned, an oligomerization domain allows the formation of oligomers (eg, dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc., of peptides or proteins). Virtually any oligomerization domain, for example, a dimerization, trimerization, tetramerization, etc. domain, present in different proteins, both eukaryotic and prokaryotic, capable of being recombinantly expressed and forming a protein oligomer of the protein that It comprises it can be used in the present invention. In a particular embodiment, said oligomerization domain is a trimerization domain, such as the trimerization domain of the NCl domain of collagen XVIII or collagen XV; in a specific embodiment, said oligomerization domain is the trimerization domain of the NCl domain of collagen XVIII or collagen XV to which all or part of the ES domain has been removed. Therefore, in a particular and preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence (B ') comprises the nucleotide sequence encoding the mammalian collagen NCl domain XVIII or the mammalian collagen XV NCl domain, in which, optionally, all or part of the ES domain has been removed. The sequences of said NCl domains of collagen XV and XVIII are known; by way of illustration, the sequence of the NC 1 domain of collagen XVIII has been previously described by Sasaki et al.

Ambos dominios se encuentran unidos por un espaciador de 21 aminoÃ¡cidos para formar un monÃ³mero del anticuerpo L36 en formato trimerbody. Las coordenadas de los monÃ³meros restantes se obtuvieron mediante la aplicaciÃ³n de un eje triple de simetrÃ­a de rotaciÃ³n. El modelo del trimerbody L36 se formÃ³ mediante la suma de las coordenadas de los tres monÃ³meros. La estructura fue optimizada con GROMACS [Van Der Spoel, D. et al. 2005; J. Comput.

The structure of the NCl trimerization subdomain of the amino terminal end of murine collagen XVIII was obtained from ModBase [Pieper, U. et al. 2004, Nucleic Acids Res .; 32: D217-22]. Both domains are linked by a 21 amino acid spacer to form a monomer of the L36 antibody in trimerbody format. The coordinates of the remaining monomers were obtained by applying a triple axis of rotation symmetry. The L36 trimerbody model was formed by adding the coordinates of the three monomers. The structure was optimized with GROMACS [Van Der Spoel, D. et al. 2005; J. Comput. Chem .; 26: 1701-18] and its energy evaluated with DFIRE [Zhou, H. et al. 2002; Prot. Sci., 11: 2714-26]. In order to compare DFIRE values between the monomer and the trimer, the energies were normalized by dividing them by the length of the sequence.

RESULTADOS\nII. RESULTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDiseÃ±o y expresiÃ³n de las construcciones trimÃ©ricas Los anÃ¡lisis estructurales del dominio NCl del colÃ¡geno XVIII murino sugieren que consiste en tres segmentos: un dominio de trimerizaciÃ³n amino terminal implicado en el autoensamblaje de los homotrÃ­meros; una regiÃ³n flexible sensible a proteasas; y un dominio compacto carboxiterminal de endostatina (ES) [Sasaki, T. et al. 1998; EMBO J. 17:4249-56]. Los investigadores han demostrado previamente que un Ac recombinante conteniendo el scFv L36 anti-laminina fusionado al dominio amino terminal NC l del colÃ¡geno XVIII murino era producido y secretado en forma funcionalmente activa por cÃ©lulas HEK-293 [SÃ¡nchez- ArÃ© valo, LV et al.

AdemÃ¡s, para proporcionar la suficiente flexibilidad espacial al scFv situado en la regiÃ³n amino terminal, se insertÃ³ un conector artificial de 21 aminoÃ¡cidos [SÃ¡nchez-ArÃ©valo, LV et al. (2006), citado supra].\nDesign and expression of trimeric constructs Structural analyzes of the NCl domain of murine collagen XVIII suggest that it consists of three segments: an amino terminal trimerization domain involved in the self-assembly of homotymers; a flexible protease sensitive region; and a compact carboxy-terminal domain of endostatin (ES) [Sasaki, T. et al. 1998; EMBO J. 17: 4249-56]. Researchers have previously shown that a recombinant Ac containing the anti-laminin scFv L36 fused to the amino terminal NC domain of murine collagen XVIII was produced and functionally secreted by HEK-293 cells [SÃ¡nchez-ArÃ© valo, LV et al. (2006). Int. J. Cancer 119: 455-462]. In addition, to provide sufficient spatial flexibility to the scFv located in the amino terminal region, an artificial 21 amino acid connector was inserted [SÃ¡nchez-ArÃ©valo, LV et al. (2006), cited supra].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa naturaleza trimÃ©rica de la proteÃ­na de fusiÃ³n scFv-NCl fue demostrada por ultracentrifugaciÃ³n [SÃ¡nchez-ArÃ©valo, LV et al.

La eluciÃ³n del scFv L36 mediante cromatografÃ­a analÃ­tica de filtraciÃ³n en gel pone de manifiesto que es un monÃ³mero. La calibraciÃ³n de la columna segÃºn los marcadores utilizados proporciona un peso molecular de 24,2 kDa, acorde con el teÃ³rico (26,9 kDa). Por el contrario, la eluciÃ³n de la fusiÃ³n scFv L36-NC1 se corresponde con un peso molecular de 109,3 kDa, indicando \n\n su naturaleza trimÃ©rica (el peso teÃ³rico del trÃ­mero es de 111,4 kDa), acorde con los datos anteriores de ultracentrifugaciÃ³n [SÃ¡nchez-ArÃ©valo, LV et al. (2006), citado supra]. Este formato de anticuerpo trimÃ©rico ha sido designado como \"trimerbody\".\nThe trimeric nature of the scFv-NCl fusion protein was demonstrated by ultracentrifugation [SÃ¡nchez-ArÃ©valo, LV et al. (2006), cited above] and analytical gel filtration chromatography (Figure IA). Elution of sc36 L36 by analytical gel filtration chromatography shows that it is a monomer. The calibration of the column according to the markers used provides a molecular weight of 24.2 kDa, in accordance with the theoretical one (26.9 kDa). In contrast, elution of the scFv L36-NC1 fusion corresponds to a molecular weight of 109.3 kDa, indicating  its trimeric nature (the theoretical weight of the trimer is 111.4 kDa), in accordance with the previous ultracentrifugation data [SÃ¡nchez-ArÃ©valo, LV et al.

This trimeric antibody format has been designated as \"trimerbody\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEn la presente invenciÃ³n, se ha ampliado el concepto mediante el diseÃ±o de trimerbodies con especificidades diferentes para el hapteno NIP o el CEA humano.

The scFvs coding genes derived from the anti-NIP (B 1.8) and human anti-CEA (MFE23) Acs were assembled in a similar manner and expressed as soluble proteins in functionally active HEK-293 cells. Recombinant proteins were purified by affinity columns (IMAC) and their yield was greater than 95%, as verified in polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE). Both Bl.8 and MFE-23 trimerbodies eluted from the column with single peaks (data not shown) comparable to those shown in the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFigura IA.\nFigure IA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEstudios de uniÃ³n a su antÃ­geno\nAntigen binding studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLa funcionalidad de los trimerbodies purificados se demostrÃ³ mediante ELISA frente a los antÃ­genos inmovilizados conjugados NIP-BSA (NIPio-BSA), laminina EHS murina y CEA humano (Figura IB). Su capacidad para detectar a su antÃ­geno en un contexto celular fue investigada mediante el mareaje por inmuno fluorescencia de cÃ©lulas tumorales humanas que expresan el antÃ­geno CEA en su superficie celular. La fluorescencia se observÃ³ tras la incubaciÃ³n con el trimerbody MFE-23, seguido de reacciÃ³n con el AcM anti-myc y detecciÃ³n con el Ac de cabra anti-IgG de ratÃ³n conjugado con FITC. Por el contrario, la incubaciÃ³n de cÃ©lulas que expresan CEA (CEA\n+\n) con el trimerbody B 1.8 o la incubaciÃ³n con cÃ©lulas HeLa que no expresan CEA (CEA ) con el trimerbody MFE-23 no mostrÃ³ fluorescencia alguna (Figura IC). Estos resultados indican que los trimerbodies no sÃ³lo reconocen al antÃ­geno inmovilizado, sino que tambiÃ©n reconocen el antÃ­geno nativo expresado en la superficie de cÃ©lulas tumorales.\nThe functionality of the purified trimerbodies was demonstrated by ELISA against the conjugated immobilized antigens NIP-BSA (NIPio-BSA), murine EHS laminin and human CEA (Figure IB). Its ability to detect its antigen in a cellular context was investigated by immuno fluorescence mapping of human tumor cells expressing the CEA antigen on its cell surface. Fluorescence was observed after incubation with the MFE-23 trimerbody, followed by reaction with the anti-myc AcM and detection with the FITC conjugated mouse goat anti-IgG Ac. In contrast, incubation of cells expressing CEA (CEA \n+\n ) with trimerbody B 1.8 or incubation with HeLa cells that do not express CEA (CEA) with trimerbody MFE-23 showed no fluorescence (Figure IC). These results indicate that trimerbodies not only recognize the immobilized antigen, but also recognize the native antigen expressed on the surface of tumor cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLos ensayos de SPR sirvieron para determinar la influencia del formato de scFv o de trimerbody sobre la funcionalidad del Ac Bl.8. Se compararon las cinÃ©ticas de uniÃ³n de cada formato de Ac utilizando tres densidades diferentes del NIPio-BSA inmovilizado sobre la superficie del chip. Se utilizÃ³ BSA acoplado a dextrano como \n\n referencia de inespecificidad. Para comparar las respuestas de uniÃ³n durante los procesos de asociaciÃ³n-disociaciÃ³n, se inyectaron varias concentraciones de Ac B 1.8 (desde 9 a 1.200 nM para el scFv y de 6 a 800 nM para el trimerbody). Bajo estas condiciones, solo el trimerbody alcanzÃ³ la saturaciÃ³n de la superficie del antÃ­geno, mientras que el scFv se uniÃ³ lentamente y con una disociaciÃ³n aparente mÃ¡s rÃ¡pida. Los sensogramas indican que el trimerbody tiene una mayor capacidad de uniÃ³n que su versiÃ³n monovalente (Figura ID).\nThe SPR tests served to determine the influence of the scFv or trimerbody format on the functionality of Ac Bl.8. The binding kinetics of each Ac format were compared using three different densities of the NIPio-BSA immobilized on the chip surface. BSA coupled to dextran was used as  nonspecificity reference. To compare the binding responses during association-dissociation processes, several concentrations of Ac B 1.8 (from 9 to 1,200 nM for the scFv and 6 to 800 nM for the trimerbody) were injected. Under these conditions, only the trimerbody reached the saturation of the antigen surface, while the scFv joined slowly and with a faster apparent dissociation. Sensograms indicate that the trimerbody has a greater binding capacity than its monovalent version (Figure ID).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPara los estudios cinÃ©ticos, se utilizÃ³ un chip recubierto con aproximadamente 100 UR de NIPio-BSA. En estos ensayos, el scFv Bl.8 se comportÃ³ de forma muy diferente al trimerbody Bl.8, con cocientes de asociaciÃ³n mÃ¡s lentos y de disociaciÃ³n mÃ¡s rÃ¡pidos. Las constantes cinÃ©ticas de asociaciÃ³n (k\na\n) y de disociaciÃ³n (ka) se determinaron mediante ajuste simultÃ¡neo utilizando el modelo de interacciÃ³n Langmuir 1 :1. Para el scFv B 1.8, las constantes cinÃ©ticas de asociaciÃ³n (k\na\n) y de disociaciÃ³n (ka) aparentes fueron k\na\n: 1,0 x 10\n4\n Â± 1,7 x 10\n2\n M\n'\nV\n1\n y k\nd\n: 2 x 10\n~3\n Â± 4 x 10\n\"5\n s\n\"1\n (Chi\n2\n = 0,189). Utilizando K\nD\n = kd/k\na\n, la constante de disociaciÃ³n en equilibrio para scFv Bl.8, se estimÃ³ en 2 x 10\n\"7\n M. Dependiendo de la concentraciÃ³n de Ac utilizado en cada ensayo, el trimerbody inyectado en condiciones de baja densidad de NIPio-BSA inmovilizado podrÃ­a probablemente unirse de forma mono- y multivalente, e incluso las constantes cinÃ©ticas de uniÃ³n aparentes podrÃ­an incluir efectos de avidez por uniÃ³n multivalente. Usando un modelo de interacciÃ³n 1 :1 en el que las fases de asociaciÃ³n y disociaciÃ³n se tratan de forma separada para cada concentraciÃ³n, se ajustaron los resultados experimentales para la uniÃ³n de B 1.8 trivalente. Los datos de las curvas con valores de resonancia que se aproximan a R\nmax\n serÃ­an prÃ³ximos a los obtenidos para la uniÃ³n monovalente. En este caso, a medida que la concentraciÃ³n del trimerbody B 1.8 aumentaba, la k\na\n disminuyÃ³ de 4 x 10\n5\n M\n-1\nS\n\"1\n (12,5 nM trimerbody) a 2 x 10\n4\n M\n-1\nS\n\"1\n (800 nM trimerbody). Estos cambios son compatibles con los cambios en la proporciÃ³n de anticuerpo que se une al ligando de forma mono- o multivalente, ya que una aproximaciÃ³n a la saturaciÃ³n de la superficie conduce a una proporciÃ³n mayor de uniÃ³n de anticuerpo monovalente. La ka aparente tiene un rango mÃ¡s estrecho, de 6 x 10\n\"4\n (12,5 nM) a 9 x 10\n\"4\n (800 nM). Considerando que a 12,5 nM, la mayor parte de los trimerbodies puede unirse de forma bi- o multivalente, la afinidad funcional del \n\n trimerbody calculada para esa concentraciÃ³n podrÃ­a ser K\nD\n (k\nd\n/k\na\n) de 1,5 x 10\n\"9\n M o superior.\nFor kinetic studies, a chip coated with approximately 100 UR of NIPio-BSA was used. In these trials, scFv Bl.8 behaved very differently than trimerbody Bl.8, with slower association and dissociation ratios faster. The kinetic constants of association (k \na\n ) and dissociation (ka) were determined by simultaneous adjustment using the Langmuir 1: 1 interaction model. For scFv B 1.8, the apparent association (k \na\n ) and dissociation (ka) constants were k \na\n : 1.0 x 10 \n4\n Â± 1.7 x 10 \n2\n M \n'\n V \n1\n and k \nd\n : 2 x 10 \n~ 3\n Â± 4 x 10 \n\"5\n s \n\" 1\n (Chi \n2\n = 0.189). Using K \nD\n = kd / k \na\n , the equilibrium dissociation constant for scFv Bl.8, was estimated at 2 x 10 \n\"7\n M. Depending on the concentration of Ac used in each test, the trimerbody injected under low density conditions of immobilized NIPio-BSA could probably be mono- and multivalently bound, and even apparent binding kinetic constants could include avidity effects by multivalent binding, using a 1: 1 interaction model in which the association and dissociation phases are treated separately for each concentration, the experimental results for the trivalent B 1.8 junction were adjusted.The data of the curves with resonance values that approximate R \nmax\n would be close to those obtained for the monovalent junction. As the concentration of trimerbody B 1.8 increased, k \na\n decreased from 4 x 10 \n5\n M \n-1\n S \n\"1\n (12.5 nM trimerbody) to 2 x 10 \n4\n M \n-1\n S \n\" 1\n (800 nM trimerbody). These changes are compatibl it is with the changes in the proportion of antibody that binds to the ligand in a mono- or multivalent manner, since an approximation to surface saturation leads to a greater proportion of monovalent antibody binding. The apparent ka has a narrower range, from 6 x 10 \n\"4\n (12.5 nM) to 9 x 10 \n\" 4\n (800 nM). Considering that at 12.5 nM, most of the trimerbodies can bind bi- or multivalently, the functional affinity of the  trimerbody calculated for that concentration could be K \nD\n (k \nd\n / k \na\n ) of 1.5 x 10 \n\"9\n M or higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPara asegurar que al menos hay dos sitios activos de uniÃ³n en una misma molÃ©cula de trimerbody, cÃ©lulas 293T fueron transfectadas con los plÃ¡smidos codificantes de trimerbodies L36, Bl .8 o con ambos plÃ¡smidos en una co-transfecciÃ³n. Ensayos de transferencia Western pusieron de manifiesto que ambos trimerbodies eran expresados en el sobrenadante de las cÃ©lulas y que se unÃ­an a sus antÃ­genos respectivos, y que la cantidad de trimerbody era mÃ¡s alta en cÃ©lulas 293T co-transfectadas (con ambos plÃ¡smidos) que en cÃ©lulas 293T monotransfectadas (datos no mostrados). El medio condicionado de las cÃ©lulas 293T monotransfectadas unidas a NIPiO-BSA o laminina, asÃ­ como el medio condicionado de las cÃ©lulas 293T co-transfectadas reconocen ambos antÃ­genos (Figura 2A). En un ensayo de ELISA, medio condicionado de las cÃ©lulas 293T co-transfectadas (es decir, doblemente transfectadas), se aÃ±adiÃ³ a placas recubiertas con laminina y, tras lavado, los trimerbodies unidos a laminina eran capaces de capturar NIPio-BSA soluble (Figura 2B), demostrando su multivalencia. Por el contrario, los trimerbodies en el sobrenadante de cÃ©lulas 293T monotransfectadas con el plÃ¡smido que codifica el trimerbody L36 eran incapaces de unirse y capturar NIP\n10\n- BSA soluble.\nTo ensure that there are at least two active binding sites in the same trimerbody molecule, 293T cells were transfected with the L36, Bl .8 trimerbodies encoding plasmids or with both plasmids in a co-transfection. Western blotting trials revealed that both trimerbodies were expressed in the cell supernatant and that they bound their respective antigens, and that the amount of trimerbody was higher in co-transfected 293T cells (with both plasmids) than in cells 293T monotransfected (data not shown). The conditioned medium of the monotransfected 293T cells bound to NIPiO-BSA or laminin, as well as the conditioned medium of the co-transfected 293T cells recognize both antigens (Figure 2A). In an ELISA assay, conditioned medium of co-transfected 293T cells (i.e., double transfected), was added to laminin-coated plates and, after washing, laminin-linked trimerbodies were able to capture soluble NIPio-BSA (Figure 2B), demonstrating its multivalence. In contrast, trimerbodies in the supernatant of 293T cells monotransfected with the plasmid encoding trimerbody L36 were unable to bind and capture soluble NIP \n10\n -BSA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEnsayos de estabilidad frente a suero in vitro\nIn vitro serum stability tests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nUn aspecto muy importante para determinar la potencial aplicaciÃ³n in vivo de los fragmentos de Ac diseÃ±ados es comprobar la estabilidad frente a suero. Los investigadores han determinado la funcionalidad y la estabilidad estructural del trimerbody L36 tras incubaciÃ³n con suero humano y murino a 37\n0\nC durante periodos prolongados de tiempo (igual o superiores a 72 horas), mediante ensayos de transferencia Western y ELISA. Tal como se muestra en la Figura 3, el trimerbody L36 mantiene un 80-90% de su capacidad de uniÃ³n a su antÃ­geno tras 72 horas de incubaciÃ³n.\nA very important aspect to determine the potential in vivo application of the designed Ac fragments is to check the stability against serum. Researchers have determined the functionality and the structural stability of L36 trimerbody after incubation with human and mouse serum at 37 \n0\n C for extended periods of time (equal to or greater than 72 hours), using assays and Western blot and ELISA. As shown in Figure 3, trimerbody L36 maintains 80-90% of its binding capacity to its antigen after 72 hours of incubation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEnsayos de localizaciÃ³n especÃ­fica de tumores in vivo\nIn vivo specific tumor localization assays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPara evaluar la biodistribuciÃ³n de, y la localizaciÃ³n especÃ­fica de tumores por, los trimerbodies anti-NIP, anti-CEA y anti- laminina, se utilizÃ³ un sistema Ã³ptico de \n\n imagen molecular, que permite la evaluaciÃ³n de la cinÃ©tica de localizaciÃ³n del tumor y del aclaramiento por el Ac en un mismo animal y en diferentes tiempos del ensayo. Los trimerbodies fueron conjugados con el fluorocromo de emisiÃ³n cercana al infrarrojo Cy5 e inyectados por vÃ­a intravenosa (i.v.) en la vena de la cola de ratones hembra atÃ­micos desnudos nu/nu portadores de tumores humanos MKN45 (adenocarcinoma gÃ¡strico), HT-1080 (fibrosarcoma), o HeLa (adenocarinoma de cÃ©rvix) (n =4/grupo). Todos los trimerbodies mostraron un rÃ¡pido aclaramiento renal tras la inyecciÃ³n i.v., con un mÃ¡ximo de intensidad de seÃ±al a las 3 horas, siendo indetectable a las 48 horas post-inyecciÃ³n (Figuras 4 A y 4C). El trimerbody B 1.8 no mostrÃ³ localizaciÃ³n detectable de tumor en ninguno de los tres tipos de tumores estudiados (Figuras 4B y 5). Se observÃ³ una selectiva y fuerte acumulaciÃ³n en los tumores que expresan CEA (CEA\n+\n) del trimerbody MFE-23. Tras la inyecciÃ³n i.v. del trimerbody MFE-23-Cy5, el mÃ¡ximo de seÃ±al registrada se produjo a las 3 horas, decayendo la seÃ±al a las 24 horas y manteniÃ©ndose detectable a las 48 horas (Figura 4B). El trimerbody anti-laminina mostrÃ³ localizaciÃ³n especÃ­fica de tumor en todos los modelos estudiados (sean o no tumores que expresasen CEA) (Figuras 4B y 5). Sin embargo, la cinÃ©tica de intensidad de seÃ±al resultÃ³ diferente al trimerbody MFE- 23, siendo el mÃ¡ximo de seÃ±al a las 24 horas, algo menor que el mÃ¡ximo obtenido por el trimerbody MFE-23. El scFv anti-laminina tambiÃ©n mostrÃ³ localizaciÃ³n especÃ­fica de tumor pero a un nivel mucho mÃ¡s bajo que el del trimerbody anti-laminina (Figuras 4B y 4D).\nTo evaluate the biodistribution of, and the specific location of tumors by, the anti-NIP, anti-CEA and anti-laminin trimerbodies, an optical system of  molecular image, which allows the evaluation of the kinetics of tumor location and clearance by Ac in the same animal and at different times of the test. The trimerbodies were conjugated with Cy5 infrared near-emission fluorochrome and injected intravenously (iv) into the tail vein of nude female nude mice nu / nu carrying human tumors MKN45 (gastric adenocarcinoma), HT-1080 (fibrosarcoma ), or HeLa (cervical adenocarinoma) (n = 4 / group). All trimerbodies showed rapid renal clearance after iv injection, with a maximum signal intensity at 3 hours, being undetectable at 48 hours post-injection (Figures 4 A and 4C). Trimerbody B 1.8 showed no detectable tumor location in any of the three types of tumors studied (Figures 4B and 5). A selective and strong accumulation was observed in tumors expressing CEA (CEA \n+\n ) of the trimerbody MFE-23. After iv injection of the MFE-23-Cy5 trimerbody, the maximum recorded signal occurred at 3 hours, the signal decaying at 24 hours and remaining detectable at 48 hours (Figure 4B). The trimerbody anti-laminin showed specific tumor location in all models studied (whether or not tumors expressing CEA) (Figures 4B and 5). However, the signal strength kinetics was different from the MFE-23 trimerbody, the maximum signal being at 24 hours, somewhat less than the maximum obtained by the MFE-23 trimerbody. The anti-laminin scFv also showed tumor specific location but at a much lower level than that of the anti-laminin trimerbody (Figures 4B and 4D).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIII. DISCUSIÃN\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEstudios previos de los investigadores mostraban la capacidad de las secuencias derivadas de colÃ¡geno de promover la trimerizaciÃ³n de anticuerpos [SÃ¡nchez-Arevalo VJ et al. (2006) Int J CÃ¡ncer 119:455-462]. En dichos estudios, se mostraba que la fusiÃ³n del subdominio NCl N-terminal de colÃ¡geno XVIII, responsable de la trimerizaciÃ³n no- covalente de las cadenas alfa del colÃ¡geno XVIII al extremo C-terminal de un anticuerpo scFv, confiere un estado trimÃ©rico al anticuerpo generado (\"trimerbody\"). AsÃ­, se demostrÃ³ que utilizando un scFv (L36) que reconoce un epÃ­topo de laminina asociado a angiogÃ©nesis y que inhibe la angiogÃ©nesis y el crecimiento del tumor, el L36 trimÃ©rico \n\n era mÃ¡s efectivo que el correspondiente monomÃ©rico en la inhibiciÃ³n de la morfogÃ©nesis capilar in vitro, e inhibiendo el crecimiento del tumor in vivo [SÃ¡nchez- Arevalo VJ et al. (2006), citado supra]. Otro grupo investigador [Fan CY et al. (2008). FASEB J 22:3795- 3804] ha utilizado una aproximaciÃ³n similar para multimerizar anticuerpos y ha demostrado que un esqueleto de pÃ©ptidos cortos similares a colÃ¡geno era capaz de promover la trimerizaciÃ³n de fragmentos scFv fusionados (\"collabody\").\nPrevious studies of the researchers showed the ability of collagen-derived sequences to promote antibody trimerization [SÃ¡nchez-Arevalo VJ et al. (2006) Int J Cancer 119: 455-462]. In these studies, it was shown that the fusion of the N-terminal NCl sub-domain of collagen XVIII, responsible for the non-covalent trimerization of the alpha chains of collagen XVIII to the C-terminal end of an scFv antibody, confers a trimeric state to the generated antibody (\"trimerbody\"). Thus, it was demonstrated that using a scFv (L36) that recognizes a laminin epitope associated with angiogenesis and that inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth, the trimeric L36  it was more effective than the corresponding monomer in inhibiting capillary morphogenesis in vitro, and inhibiting tumor growth in vivo [SÃ¡nchez-Arevalo VJ et al. (2006), cited supra]. Another research group [Fan CY et al. (2008). FASEB J 22: 3795- 3804] has used a similar approach to multimerize antibodies and has shown that a skeleton of short collagen-like peptides was capable of promoting trimerization of fused scFv fragments (\"collabody\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEn la presente invenciÃ³n, se presenta una caracterizaciÃ³n detallada, tanto in vivo como in vitro de la fusiÃ³n del anticuerpo-dominio de oligomerizaciÃ³n, y se extiende el concepto produciendo molÃ©culas anÃ¡logas con especificidad frente al hapteno NIP y frente a un antÃ­geno asociado a tumores (CEA). En particular, se han desarrollado unas proteÃ­nas trimÃ©ricas (trÃ­meros) que comprenden 3 proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n, comprendiendo cada proteÃ­na de fusiÃ³n un fragmento de un anticuerpo y una secuencia derivada de colÃ¡geno que comprende el dominio de trimerizaciÃ³n; dichas proteÃ­nas oligomÃ©ricas (trÃ­meros) caen dentro del concepto \"trimerbody\" acuÃ±ado en esta descripciÃ³n. Todos los trimerbodies se aislaron en una forma activa a partir de medio condicionado obtenido de cÃ©lulas HEK293 transfectadas y fueron fÃ¡cilmente purificados utilizando cromatografÃ­a de afinidad por metal inmovilizado. Los trimerbodies son trimÃ©ricos en soluciÃ³n, y poseen una excelente estabilidad y capacidad de uniÃ³n al antÃ­geno. Los trimerbodies son muy eficientes reconociendo antÃ­genos purificados inmovilizados sobre una placa, o expresados en la superficie de una cÃ©lula tumoral. AnÃ¡lisis mediante SPR demostrÃ³ que el trimerbody tenÃ­a una seÃ±al de uniÃ³n mayor que el anticuerpo monomÃ©rico y aparentemente una disociaciÃ³n menor, consistente con la uniÃ³n multivalente al antÃ­geno. Los investigadores calcularon que el trimerbody anti-NIP tiene una afinidad funcional por el antÃ­geno (conjugados NIP-BSA) unas 100 veces mayor, comparado con la versiÃ³n monovalente. Este resultado sugiere que esta ganancia de afinidad podrÃ­a ser debida al efecto de avidez de un segundo sitio de combinaciÃ³n en la molÃ©cula de trimerbody. La presencia de al menos dos sitios de uniÃ³n funcionales en una sola molÃ©cula de trimerbody fue posteriormente demostrada mediante la generaciÃ³n de trimerbodies biespecÃ­ficos. Trimerbodies bifuncionales anti-laminina y anti-NIP estables fueron fÃ¡cilmente producidos por co-expresiÃ³n de dos construcciones diferentes de trimerbodies en cÃ©lulas humanas. \n\n La ganancia en afinidad a travÃ©s de la avidez hace a los trimerbodies atractivos para tÃ©cnicas de imagen in vivo como agentes alternativos a los anticuerpos dimÃ©ricos. Se podrÃ­a, por tanto, especular que los trimerbodies se preferirÃ¡n sobre los anticuerpos dimÃ©ricos (diabodies y minibodies), aunque esta propiedad puede depender de la estructura y densidad del antÃ­geno reconocido por los scFv. Para una completa avidez en anticuerpos multivalentes dirigidos a molÃ©culas unidas a la superficie, los sitios de uniÃ³n del antÃ­geno deben apuntar hacia la misma direcciÃ³n. Si la uniÃ³n mÃºltiple simultÃ¡nea no es posible estÃ©ticamente, entonces la ganancia aparente en afinidad funcional es probable que sea menor y debida Ãºnicamente al efecto de uniÃ³n aumentado, que es dependiente en tasas de difusiÃ³n y la concentraciÃ³n del antÃ­geno de superficie [Lawrence LJ et al. (1998) FEBS letters 425:479-484]. El anÃ¡lisis del modelo de trimerbody sugiere una estructura con forma de trÃ­pode con los dominios scFv orientados hacia fuera (Figura 6). La flexibilidad entre los sitios de uniÃ³n al antÃ­geno es otro aspecto importante en el diseÃ±o de anticuerpos multivalentes, requeridos para el entre cruz amiento de receptores de superficie, bien en la misma cÃ©lula o en adyacentes. El espaciador de 21 residuos, con una longitud mÃ¡xima de 79,8 Ã si la conformaciÃ³n es completamente extendida, es muy flexible, permitiendo numerosas geometrÃ­as de uniÃ³n. Cuando una interacciÃ³n antÃ­geno- anticuerpo ocurre, la posibilidad de establecer una segunda interacciÃ³n depende de la valencia, orientaciÃ³n y flexibilidad del sitio de uniÃ³n del antÃ­geno. SegÃºn los cÃ¡lculos de los inventores, en la molÃ©cula de trimerbody, los scFv que permanecen sin interaccionar tienen un Ã¡rea de influencia unas 11 veces mayor, aproximadamente, que otros formatos bivalentes, tales como los diabodies y los minibodies, aumentando la probabilidad de una segunda interacciÃ³n efectiva. Uniones mÃºltiples pueden, efectivamente, reducir las \"off rates \" aumentando asÃ­ el tiempo de retenciÃ³n del anticuerpo unido al antÃ­geno diana. A este respecto, una ventaja mayor del trimerbody sobre otros formatos trimÃ©ricos (como el collabody) es la flexibilidad. La estructura mÃ¡s compacta/rÃ­gida del collabody reduce la accesibilidad de los scFv, que es un parÃ¡metro crÃ­tico para la localizaciÃ³n de tumores in vivo.\nIn the present invention, a detailed characterization is presented, both in vivo and in vitro of the fusion of the oligomerization antibody-domain, and the concept is extended by producing analogous molecules with specificity against the NIP hapten and against a tumor associated antigen ( CEA). In particular, trimeric (trimer) proteins comprising 3 fusion proteins have been developed, each fusion protein comprising a fragment of an antibody and a sequence derived from collagen comprising the trimerization domain; said oligomeric proteins (trimers) fall within the \"trimerbody\" concept coined in this description. All trimerbodies were isolated in an active form from conditioned medium obtained from transfected HEK293 cells and were easily purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Trimerbodies are trimeric in solution, and possess excellent stability and antigen binding capacity. Trimerbodies are very efficient in recognizing purified antigens immobilized on a plate, or expressed on the surface of a tumor cell. SPR analysis showed that the trimerbody had a greater binding signal than the monomeric antibody and apparently a smaller dissociation, consistent with multivalent antigen binding. The researchers calculated that the anti-NIP trimerbody has a functional affinity for the antigen (NIP-BSA conjugates) about 100 times higher, compared to the monovalent version. This result suggests that this affinity gain could be due to the avidity effect of a second combination site in the trimerbody molecule. The presence of at least two functional binding sites in a single trimerbody molecule was subsequently demonstrated by the generation of bispecific trimerbodies. Stable anti-laminin and anti-NIP bifunctional trimerbodies were easily produced by co-expression of two different constructs of trimerbodies in human cells.  The affinity gain through avidity makes trimerbodies attractive for in vivo imaging techniques as alternative agents to dimeric antibodies. It could, therefore, be speculated that trimerbodies will be preferred over dimeric antibodies (diabodies and minibodies), although this property may depend on the structure and density of the antigen recognized by scFv. For complete avidity in multivalent antibodies directed to surface bound molecules, the antigen binding sites must point in the same direction. If simultaneous multiple binding is not aesthetically possible, then the apparent gain in functional affinity is likely to be less and due solely to the increased binding effect, which is dependent on diffusion rates and the concentration of the surface antigen [Lawrence LJ et al . (1998) FEBS letters 425: 479-484]. The analysis of the trimerbody model suggests a tripod-shaped structure with the scFv domains oriented outwards (Figure 6). Flexibility between antigen binding sites is another important aspect in the design of multivalent antibodies, required for cross-linking of surface receptors, either in the same cell or in adjacent ones. The spacer of 21 residues, with a maximum length of 79.8 Ã if the conformation is fully extended, is very flexible, allowing numerous joining geometries. When an antigen-antibody interaction occurs, the possibility of establishing a second interaction depends on the valence, orientation and flexibility of the antigen binding site. According to the calculations of the inventors, in the trimerbody molecule, scFv that remain without interaction have an area of influence approximately 11 times greater, than other bivalent formats, such as diabodies and minibodies, increasing the probability of a second effective interaction Multiple binding can effectively reduce the \"off rates\" thus increasing the retention time of the antibody bound to the target antigen. In this respect, a major advantage of the trimerbody over other trimeric formats (such as collabody) is flexibility. The more compact / rigid collabody structure reduces the accessibility of scFv, which is a critical parameter for tumor localization in vivo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAsÃ­, la multimerizaciÃ³n de las construcciones scFv presenta ventajas para las aplicaciones in vivo. Los anticuerpos recombinantes, tal como los diabodies y minibodies han demostrado su potencial como agentes de localizaciÃ³n in vivo [Holliger P et al. (2005) Nat Biotechnol 23:1126-1136]. Los trimerbodies son molÃ©culas multivalentes de \n\n tamaÃ±o intermedio que presentan una alta estabilidad en condiciones fisiolÃ³gicas. El potencial de los trimerbodies para la localizaciÃ³n in vivo se estudiÃ³ en modelos experimentales de cÃ¡ncer humano en ratones desnudos. Los trimerbodies anti-CEA localizan rÃ¡pida y especÃ­ficamente en los tumores CEA-positivos. La mÃ¡xima seÃ±al en el tumor se alcanzaba a las 3 horas tras la inyecciÃ³n y era lentamente eliminada a lo largo del tiempo. La fluorescencia era aÃºn detectable en el tumor tras 48 horas tras la inyecciÃ³n con el trimerbody. Es de destacar que el anticuerpo trimerbody anti-laminina L36 se localiza en todos los tumores estudiados independientemente de su estirpe histolÃ³gica. El mÃ¡ximo de absorciÃ³n de los trimerbodies anti-laminina fue a las 24 horas tras la administraciÃ³n del mismo. A pesar de que los scFv L36 anti-laminina presentaban una acumulaciÃ³n especÃ­fica en el tumor, la acumulaciÃ³n en el tumor era menor, probablemente debido a su eliminaciÃ³n mÃ¡s rÃ¡pida de la sangre (con una vida media menor de 15 minutos) y por su naturaleza monovalente (que implica bajos tiempos de retenciÃ³n) [Adams GP et al. (1995). CÃ¡ncer Immunol. Immunother. 40:299-306]. SegÃºn resultados previos, el epÃ­topo reconocido por el anticuerpo L36 estÃ¡ localizado en la parte media del brazo largo de la laminina, en un Ã¡rea altamente flexible, que corresponde a un sitio susceptible de proteasas. Los inventores han postulado que este epÃ­topo es Ãºnicamente accesible durante el ensamblaje de la membrana basal (MB) [Sanz L et al. (2003) EMBO J. 22:1508-1517], donde la laminina intacta durante el proceso de polimerizaciÃ³n actÃºa como soporte para el reclutamiento de otros componentes de la MB [Sasaki T et al. (2004) J. CeIl. Biol. 164:959-963]. La expresiÃ³n restringida de este epÃ­topo a situaciones asociadas con la remodelaciÃ³n de la MB, explicarÃ­a la captaciÃ³n mÃ¡s lenta de los trimerbodies L36 en comparaciÃ³n con los trimerbodies MFE23 que reconocen un antÃ­geno expresado por la cÃ©lula tumoral. MÃ¡s allÃ¡ de sus aplicaciones diagnÃ³sticas, los trimerbodies ofrecen oportunidades terapÃ©uticas prometedoras basadas en la liberaciÃ³n selectiva de molÃ©culas bioactivas en los tejidos diana. Alguna de las aplicaciones inmediatas de los trimerbodies especÃ­ficos de antÃ­genos asociados a tumores (por ejemplo, el receptor 2 del factor de crecimiento epidemial humano, antÃ­geno especÃ­fico de prÃ³stata), o dirigidos al estroma tumoral (por ejemplo, proteÃ­na de activaciÃ³n de fibroblasto) incluyen el desarrollo de proteÃ­nas de fusiÃ³n con inhibidores angiogÃ©nicos [SÃ¡nchez-Arevalo VJ et al. (2006) Int J CÃ¡ncer \n\n 119:455-462], citoquinas, enzimas, o receptores truncados, y conjugaciÃ³n con radionucleidos [Sanz L et al. (2004) Trends Immunol 25:85-91]. \n\nThus, the multimerization of scFv constructions has advantages for in vivo applications. Recombinant antibodies, such as diabodies and minibodies, have demonstrated their potential as in vivo localization agents [Holliger P et al. (2005) Nat Biotechnol 23: 1126-1136]. Trimerbodies are multivalent molecules of  intermediate size presenting high stability under physiological conditions. The potential of trimerbodies for in vivo localization was studied in experimental models of human cancer in nude mice. Anti-CEA trimerbodies quickly and specifically locate CEA-positive tumors. The maximum signal in the tumor was reached at 3 hours after the injection and was slowly eliminated over time. Fluorescence was still detectable in the tumor after 48 hours after injection with the trimerbody. It is noteworthy that the trimerbody anti-laminin L36 antibody is located in all tumors studied regardless of their histological lineage. The maximum absorption of the anti-laminin trimerbodies was 24 hours after administration. Although the L36 anti-laminin scFv had a specific accumulation in the tumor, the accumulation in the tumor was lower, probably due to its faster removal of blood (with a half-life of less than 15 minutes) and by its nature monovalent (which implies low retention times) [Adams GP et al. (nineteen ninety five). Immunol cancer. Immunother 40: 299-306]. According to previous results, the epitope recognized by the L36 antibody is located in the middle part of the long arm of the laminin, in a highly flexible area, corresponding to a protease susceptible site. The inventors have postulated that this epitope is only accessible during the assembly of the basement membrane (MB) [Sanz L et al. (2003) EMBO J. 22: 1508-1517], where the intact laminin during the polymerization process acts as a support for the recruitment of other components of the MB [Sasaki T et al. (2004) J. CeIl. Biol. 164: 959-963]. The restricted expression of this epitope to situations associated with the remodeling of MB, would explain the slower uptake of L36 trimerbodies compared to MFE23 trimerbodies that recognize an antigen expressed by the tumor cell. Beyond their diagnostic applications, trimerbodies offer promising therapeutic opportunities based on the selective release of bioactive molecules in target tissues. Some of the immediate applications of tumor-specific antigen-specific trimerbodies (e.g., the human epidemic growth factor receptor 2, prostate-specific antigen), or targeting the tumor stroma (e.g., fibroblast activation protein) include the development of fusion proteins with angiogenic inhibitors [SÃ¡nchez-Arevalo VJ et al. (2006) Int J Cancer  119: 455-462], cytokines, enzymes, or truncated receptors, and radionuclide conjugation [Sanz L et al. (2004) Trends Immunol 25: 85-91]."

Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application is a continuation in part application of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/149,097, filed Apr. 25, 2008, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/907,977, filed Apr. 25, 2007, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/924,868, filed Jun. 4, 2007, and are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention generally relates to compositions and methods for delivering a protein, peptide, epitope, or antigen to an antigen presenting cell, such as a macrophage or dendritic cell. The compositions and methods disclosed herein are particularly useful in making prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAntigen presenting cells, including macrophages and other cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system actively phagocytose particles and play a central role in the immune response. Macrophages are cells within the tissues that are derived from monocytes. These monocytes/macrophages phagocytose microbes, for example, which are then digested to smaller antigenic portions in the lysosome/phagosome. The resultant antigens are cycled back to the surface for presentation to the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system. Accordingly, monocytes/macrophages are of particular interest because they play an important role in both nonspecific and specific defenses in the host against pathogens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDendritic cells are also antigen presenting cells that express MHC class I and class II molecules. An ideal vaccine mimics the rapid uptake and transfer of pathogenic structures without actually establishing an infection and without causing suppression of the MHC class I pathway. For this purpose, the present invention relates to a composition comprising a modified particle to be phagocytosed that is avidly and specifically taken up by professional phagocytic cells, and methods for delivering cargo molecules to the cytoplasm of antigen presenting cells for presentation on MHC class I molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBefore the present invention, delivery of exogenous antigens, peptides, or proteins to an antigen presenting cell for presentation on class I MHC molecules was difficult because following degradation in vesicular intracellular compartments, such antigens would be loaded on MHC class II molecules for presentation. Indeed, the only antigens that normally activate the MHC class I pathway are those that are derived from cytosolic antigens (e.g., endogenously produced within an antigen presenting cell). Although dendritic cells can exhibit âcross presentationâ phenomena, whereby dendritic cells present exogenous antigens on a class I molecule, the localized concentration of soluble, exogenous antigen must be very high (approximately 100 or even 1000 fold higher than the present invention) for such cross presentation to occur and is therefore inefficient. On the other hand, the compositions of the present invention can efficiently deliver exogenous proteins, epitopes, antigens, and peptides, for presentation on class I molecules with only a very low amount of exogenous material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, while some proteins that escape the phagosome and enter into the cytosol of an antigen presenting cell could also activate the MHC class I pathway, a cost effective and efficient delivery method of exogenous proteins, epitopes, antigens and/or peptides for association with MHC class I molecules could not be purposefully accomplished before the present invention.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is an antigenic composition comprising (i) a polypeptide component, (ii) a buffering component, and (iii) a particle that can be phagocytosed, wherein the polypeptide component or a fragment thereof is ultimately presented on a class I MHC molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the invention is a method for efficient delivery of a polypeptide component to an antigen presenting cell comprising administering a composition comprising (i) a polypeptide component, (ii) a buffering component, and (iii) a particle that can be phagocytosed, wherein the polypeptide component, following administration, enters the cytosol from an endocytotic vesicle, and the polypeptide or a fragment thereof is presented on a MHC class I molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso described herein is a composition for exogenous antigen presentation on class I MHC molecules comprising (i) a polypeptide component, (ii) a buffering component, and (iii) a particle that can be phagocytosed, and a vaccine composition comprising (i) a polypeptide component, (ii) a buffering component, and (iii) a particle that can be phagocytosed, wherein the polypeptide component or a fragment thereof is ultimately presented on a class I MHC molecule. The polypeptide component is also delivered in an amount sufficient to provoke a CD8 T cell response, in the case of dendritic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the compositions and methods of the present invention, the particle that can be phagocytosed is a biodegradable particle, such as zymosan particle, chitin particle, agarose particle or sepharose particle, and the buffering component can be any buffer with a buffering capacity in the range of about pH 6 to about pH 8, such as RCONHNH\n2\n, polyethyleneimine, oligohistidine, oligoornithine, and oligolysine.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n. Antigenic stimulation of MHC-I (H-2K\nb\n) restricted B3Z hybridoma reporter cells specific for the internal OVA epitope SINFEKL in the absence or presence of IC-21 (H-2K\nb\n) antigen presenting cells.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a composition for delivery to an antigen presenting cell, and a related method of use. The composition according to the present invention comprises a polypeptide component, attached to a particle that can be phagocytosed and a buffering component. The present invention takes advantage of the phagocytic property of certain antigen presenting cells in that the polypeptide component is provided on a substrate that âlooksâ like a microbe. Thus, the particle attracts phagocytic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention do not contain liposomes (vesicles with an aqueous interior enclosed by one or more phospholipid bilayers), nor are the compositions disclosed herein taken up by macrophages, dendritic, or other antigen presenting cells based on an agent that permeabilizes the extracellular membrane of these cells. The compositions of the present invention also do not utilize haemolysin to permeabilize the phagosomal membrane.\n\n\n \nParticle to be Phagocytosed\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the particle to be phagocytosed (âparticleâ) is a biodegradable particle, such as one derived from natural sources. In one embodiment, the particle to be phagocytosed is of microbial origin, and is preferably a particle from a yeast cell wall. In another embodiment, the yeast cell wall particle is a zymosan particle. Zymosan (also referred to as Zymosan A) is commercially available from various companies such as Sigma-Aldrich. Natural particles, such as zymosan, are better tolerated by macrophages, for example, than magnetic beads and particles from other sources.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nZymosan is an insoluble polysaccharide component of yeast cell wall. Prior publications uncovered zymosan's involvements in (i) induction of the release of cytokines or proinflammatory cytokines, (ii) induction of protein phosphorylation and inositol phosphate formation, (iii) arachidonate mobilization, (iv) activation of the alternative complement pathway; and (v) raise of cyclin D2 levels, suggesting a role of cyclin D2 in macrophage activation (Miyasato et al., \nInt. Arch. Allergy Immunol. \n104: 24-26, 1994). For example, it has been reported that zymosan particles are capable of inducing inflammatory signals in macrophages through Toll-like receptors, e.g. TLR2 and TLR6, and dectin-1, which is a receptor that binds Î²-glucans and is important for macrophage phagocytosis. Zymosan is also involved in inducing inflammatory responses, such as TNF-Î± production and NF-ÎºB activation in macrophages (Underhill, \nJournal of Endotoxin Research, \n9: 176-180, 2003; Sato et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n171: 417-425, 2003; Dillon et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n116: 916-928, 2006).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred size for the particle that can be phagocytosed is one that approximates the size of microbial structures that cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system and other phagocytic cells typically ingest. In one embodiment, the particle will be about 0.05 to about 5.0 Î¼m, about 0.05 to about 2.5 Î¼m, about 0.1 to about 2.5 Î¼m, about 1.0 to about 2.5 Î¼m, about 1.0 to about 2.0 Î¼m, or about 1.0 to about 1.5 Î¼m. The term âaboutâ in this context refers to Â±0.25 Î¼m. Zymosan is typically about 2.0 Î¼m in size.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the particle that can be phagocytosed is not limited by any particular size, a preferred size for the particle that can be phagocytosed is one that approximates the size of microbial structures that cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage (e.g., monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, dendritic cell precursors (immature dendritic cells), or other antigen presenting cells, typically ingest. In one embodiment, the particle will be about 0.05 to about 5.0 Î¼m, about 0.05 to about 2.5 Î¼m, about 0.1 to about 2.5 Î¼m, about 1.0 to about 2.5 Î¼m, about 1.0 to about 2.0 Î¼m, or about 1.0 to about 1.5 Î¼m. The term âaboutâ in this context refers to Â±0.25 Î¼m. Zymosan is typically about 2.0 Î¼m in size.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe particle that can be phagocytosed is also not limited by shape or material. In general, the particle can be of any shape or material that allows the composition of the present invention to be phagocytized by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, such as monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, immature dendritic cells (have a high capacity for phagocytosis, then undergo maturation), or other phagocytic cells. For example, in addition to zymosan, the particle to be phagocytosed can be made of chitin, a synthetic beta glucan polymer, agarose, sepharose, etc., so long as the particle contains a carbohydrate or other moiety that permits attachment of the polypeptide component of the present invention.\n\n\n \nPolypeptide Component\n\n\n \n \n \nThe polypeptide component of the present invention is attached to the particle to be phagocytosed. Following administration of the polypeptide component attached to the particle, the polypeptide component, or fragment thereof is released from the particle, enters the cytosol from an endocytotic vesicle (e.g., phagosome) and, as a result of normal âprocessingâ, is presented on a MHC class I molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptide component for delivery to a phagocytic cell (âcargoâ) comprises an amino acid sequence, and can be at least one peptide such as at least one epitope (approximately 8-12 amino acids in length), at least one small peptide (e.g., approximately <30 amino acids in length), at least one large peptide (approximately >30 amino acids in length), at least one full length protein, or a combination thereof. For example, the cargo can be composed of at least one tumor antigen, protein, protein fragment or a combination thereof The cargo may also be a tumor cell lysate; the large antigen capacity of the particle to be phagocytosed allows for the coupling of complex protein mixtures derived from a patient's lysed tumor tissues. The polypeptide component is an exogenous polypeptide (i.e., exogenous relative to the phagocytic cell).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, suitable cargo for use in the present invention can be allergens, viral antigens, bacterial antigens and antigens derived from parasites. Preferred antigens include tumor associated antigens, with which the artisan will be familiar (e.g., carcinoembryonic antigen, prostate-specific membrane antigen, melanoma antigen, adenocarcinoma antigen, leukemia antigen, lymphoma antigen, sarcoma antigen, MAGE-1, MAGE-2, MART-1, Melan-A, p53, gp100, antigen associated with colonic carcinoma, antigen associated with breast carcinoma, Muc1, Trp-2, telomerase, PSA and antigen associated with renal carcinoma). Whole inactivated viruses, portions of the virus, and viral antigens are also suitable polypeptide components for the present invention. In another embodiment, viral antigens include HIV, EBV, Herpes virus, and a linear gp41 epitope insertion (LLELDKWASL), which has been identified as a useful construct for improving HIV-1 Env immunogenicity (Liang, et al., Vaccine, 16; 17(22):2862-72, July 1999).\n\n\n \nBuffering Component\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention employ a buffering component, which allows the polypeptide component to evade the lysosome and enter the cytosol of the antigen presenting cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore specifically, when a cell of the mononuclear phagocyte system, such as a monocyte (or monocyte derived cell), macrophage, dendritic cell or dendritic cell precursor, ingests an antigen, a phagocytic vesicle (phagosome) which engulfs the antigen is formed. Next, a specialized lysosome contained in the phagocytic cell fuses with the newly formed phagosome. Upon fusion, the phagocytosed antigen is exposed to several highly reactive molecules as well as a concentrated mixture of lysosomal hydrolases. These highly reactive molecules and lysosomal hydrolases digest the contents of the phagosome/lysosome. Therefore, by covalently attaching a buffering component to the particle to be phagocytosed, the polypeptide component that is also attached to the particle escapes digestion by the materials in the phagosome/lysosome and enters the cytoplasm of the phagocytic cell because the buffering component is localized in the phagosome and causes a continued influx of protons, accompanied by chloride ions into the phagosome, and therefore osmotic swelling and ultimately rupture of the endosomal membrane. When the phago some bursts, fusion between the phagosome and lysosome does not occur.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the inventors of the present invention surprisingly discovered how to efficiently deliver an exogenously produced antigen, epitope, protein, peptide or other amino acid sequence 8 amino acids in length or greater, even in very small amounts, to a phagocytic cell, such as a cell of the mononuclear phagocyte system (e.g., monocyte/macrophage, dendritic cell, dendritic cell precursor), for cell surface expression by class I MHC molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the buffering component has a buffering capacity in a pH range of about pH 6 to about pH 8. An example of a buffering component suitable for use in the present invention is RCONHNH\n2\n. Another example of a buffering component is an oligo-histidine, oligo-lysine, polyamine, polyethylenimine (e.g., a low molecular weight PEI, either branched or linear), and oligo-ornithine. Several exemplary buffers can be found in a âpKa data compilation by R. Williamsâ, available at http://research.chem.psu.edu/brpgroup/pKa_compilation.pdf, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The buffering component does not form a complex with the polypeptide component as one of the buffering components exemplified herein can form with nucleic acid. The buffering component may, however, be used as a way to attach the polypeptide component. But in that way, the âbuffering componentâ does not have a buffering capacity in a pH range of about 6-8 and is therefore not acting as a buffer; it is acting as a chemical linkage instead.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the buffering component described herein, the compositions of the present invention may optionally contain an additional component that evades the degrading environment of the phagosome/lysosome. Such an additional âlysosome evading componentâ can be added to the compositions of the present invention and includes any number of amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, fatty acids, biomimetic polymers, microorganisms and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred lysosome evading components include proteins, viruses or parts of viruses. The adenovirus penton protein, for example, is a well known complex that enables the virus to evade/disrupt the lysosome/phagosome. Thus, either the intact adenovirus or the isolated penton protein, or a portion thereof (see, for example, Bal et al., Eur J Biochem 267:6074-81 (2000)), can be utilized as the lysosome evading component. Fusogenic peptides derived from N-terminal sequences of the influenza virus hemagglutinin subunit HA-2 may also be used as the lysosome evading component (Wagner, et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n89:7934-7938, 1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther preferred lysosome evading components include biomimetic polymers such as Poly (2-propyl acrylic acid) (PPAAc), which has been shown to enhance cell transfection efficiency due to enhancement of the endosomal release of a conjugate containing a plasmid of interest (see Lackey et al., Abstracts of Scientific Presentations: The Third Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene Therapy, Abstract No. 33, May 31, 2000-Jun. 4, 2000, Denver, Colo.). Examples of other lysosome evading components envisioned by the present invention are discussed by Stayton, et al. J. Control Release, 1;65(1-2):203-20, 2000.\n\n\n \nMethod for Attaching the Polypeptide Component to the Particle to be Phagocytosed\n\n\n \n \n \nAny number of methods can be used to attach the cargo to the particle to be phagocytosed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAttachment of the components discussed above to the particle to be phagocytosed can be done by any number of means. In principle, the target protein can be linked to a particle to be phagocytosed, such as a biodegradable particle, either directly or indirectly. Direct attachment, for instance, typically requires the biodegradable particle and polypeptide component to present appropriate functional groups such that a direct link between the particle and polypeptide component can be formed via reaction of these groups, and then the polypeptide component can be readily cleaved off so as to release the polypeptide component. For example, the polypeptide component may contain a sulfhydryl group that ultimately allows for attachment to the particle, or can be modified by the addition of a cysteine residue at its N or C terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndirect methods for attachment typically utilize well-known and rich chemistry of linkers suitable for this purpose and, as with direct attachment, the methods establish a cleavable bond that gives rise to free polypeptide component. In either case, the particle to be phagocytosed possesses free amino groups or it can be modified with reagents to present such groups, as described in more detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the inventors believe that such linking moieties are useful not only for presenting appropriate combinations of functional groups for linking the particle and protein, but also for possessing buffering properties in a physiological environment. The latter property is believed to allow the linked protein and particle to withstand the otherwise destructive action of intracellular lysosomes and/or phagosomes, thereby preserving the protein in its entirety until it can be cleaved from the particle-linker. Suitable buffers in this regard should confer a pH of about 6- to about 8 to the final product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn illustrative biodegradable particle in this context is zymosan because it presents convenient functional groups for modification, although any other biodegradable particle that similarly presents suitable functional groups can be adapted to the synthetic methodologies described herein. As described above, direct or indirect attachment methods are well-known. In some embodiments, the particle contains amino groups that can be incorporated directly into the synthetic schemes below. In other embodiments that are explicitly set forth below, the particles do not present amino groups but can be modified to exploit advantageous properties of one or more linking moieties that do contain amino groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo illustrate, zymosan was reacted with a source of periodate, such as sodium periodate, to yield aldehyde moieties in intermediate A as shown in reaction (i) below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany particles to be phagocytosed are suitable for use in the invention. The examples herein utilize zymosan, but any number of other well-known particles can be used such as, for instance, agarose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe next steps introduce appropriate linkers and buffers consistent with the general requirements discussed above. In general, a linker can also possess a buffering property, or a linker and buffer can be distinct moieties. In addition, the basic chemical requirement is that the combination of linker and buffer possess compatible functional groups so as to ultimately present a disulfide moiety that is highly useful for attaching an appropriately modified protein, as described in more detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in one alternative, the aldehyde groups in intermediate A were reacted with a convenient cross-linking reagent, adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH), in the presence of reductant sodium cyanoborohydride in order to introduce reactive amino groups in intermediate B as shown in reaction (ii) below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany other reagents that are well known to those who are skilled in organic chemistry can transform aldehydes into amino moieties. These reagents can be used instead of or in addition to ADH. In this instance, the inventors discovered that the ADH moiety conveniently possesses buffering properties, which simplified the chemistry because no further linker or modification was necessary to introduce a buffer, as explained more fully below. Alternatives to ADH include, for instance, isophthalic dihydrazide (IDH) and sebacic dihydrazide (SDH). Thus, other synthetic strategies that present amino moieties, as in reaction (ii) above, should account for the need for a buffer, as detailed in a further embodiment below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, it should be noted that intermediate B is depicted as being doubly substituted with ADH moieities only for illustrative purposes. In practice, at least one and any number of additional aldehyde groups can be present for reaction with a reagent such as ADH to introduce at least one ADH or other similar moiety having an amino group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntermediate B was then treated with the well-known reagent N-succinimidy1-6-(3â²-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionamido)-hexanoate, LC-SPDP, in order to introduce a convenient source of a disulfide unit in intermediate C that is capable of reacting with a thiol-substituted protein. The transformation is illustrated by reaction (iii) below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction between B and LC-SPDP or another suitable source of a disulfide moiety may result in fewer than all amino moieties participating in the reaction, as shown above. Less than complete reaction is acceptable. What is important is that at least one amino moiety reacts so as to install a disulfide moiety, thereby allowing attachment to an appropriately modified protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHeterobifunctional cross-linking reagents other than LC-SPDP are well known and are suitable for use in reaction (iii) above, and they also provide a disulfide unit. These include sulfo N-succinimidy1-6-(3â²-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionamido)-hexanoate (sulfo-LC-SPDP) and N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionate (SPDP). It is not necessary to use these particular reagents, so long as a protein ultimately can be attached to the particle. However, the reagents described above are convenient sources of disulfide moieties that are well-adapted for use in protein chemistry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, intermediate C was treated with a protein that has been reduced to display at least one sulfhydryl group, âSH, for reaction with the disulfide moiety in C, as shown in reaction (iv) below, to yield the final product D:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, it is not necessary to link the particle and protein with reagents that serve simultaneously as linkers and buffers, as illustrated by reactions (i)-(iv) above. It is sufficient that a protein ultimately is linked to the particle and that the product is buffered to pH of about 6- to about pH 8, as mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in another embodiment, the particle is derivatized with moieties that separately confer buffering and linking capacities, respectively. For instance, reaction (v) below illustrates how intermediate A was reacted with an oligo-histidine and 1,4-diaminobutane to yield the mixed addition product E:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe oligo-histidine can be various lengths. What is important is that it confers buffering properties to the final product. Because the oligo-histidine terminates in a carboxyl group, it is not well-adapted for use in the synthetic methodologies described above for further reaction with reagents containing disulfide moieties. For this reason, the bifunctional diamine serves as a linker. In principle, any diamine is suitable for this purpose because it contains a requisite amino group to react with intermediate A as well as an amino group for further reaction with the disulfide-containing reagents. Typical diamines are primary amines because they are the most reactive.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the general guidelines above, intermediate E was then treated with LC-SPDP to give intermediate F that contains a disulfide moiety, as illustrated in reaction (vi):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, as described above, other disulfide-containing reagents are used instead of LC-SPDP. Regardless of which reagent is selected, it follows from these methodologies that the presence of the oligo-histidine buffer effectively reduces the number of attachment points to the particle that will be available to an appropriately modified protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, reaction of intermediate F with a sulfhydryl-modified polypeptide component yielded final product G, as depicted in reaction (vii) below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUltimately, the polypeptide component is released intracellularly from the phagocytosed particle into the cytoplasm.\n\n\n \nFormulation\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention may be formulated for mucosal administration (e.g., intranasal and inhalational administration) or percutaneous administration. The compositions of the invention can also be formulated for parenteral administration (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous, or subcutaneous injection), and injected directly into the patient and target cells of monocytic origin, like macrophages and dendritic cells. Thus, the compositions of the present invention may be administered just like a conventional vaccine. This also substantially reduces cost because of the lower level of skill required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampules or in multi-dose containers, optionally with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. The composition of the present invention may also be formulated using a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Such excipients are well known in the art, but typically will be a physiologically tolerable aqueous solution. Physiologically tolerable solutions are those which are essentially non-toxic. Preferred excipients will either be inert or enhancing, but a suppressive compound may also be used to achieve a tolerogenic response.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention attract phagocytic cells, such as cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells or immature dendritic cells. In the field of vaccination, cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system are considered âprofessionalâ antigen presenting cells and, thus, are the ideal target for vaccine delivery. It is well known that presentation of an antigen within an APC is vastly more effective in generating a strong cellular immune response than expression of this same antigen within any other cell type. Therefore, the ability of the compositions of the present invention to present a polypeptide component for display on an antigen presenting cell via class I MHC molecules dramatically enhances the efficacy of such a vaccine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention can be used to develop CD8 T cell vaccines against viral, bacterial and parasitic infections, as well as cancer. The polypeptide component in the compositions of the present invention is delivered in an amount sufficient to provoke a CD8 T cell response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of modified particles that can be phagocytosed, including yeast cell wall particles, present a number of advantages over conventional vaccine methodologies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFirst, the compositions disclosed herein would obviate the need for attenuated live vaccines to obtain protective CD8 T cell immune responses without infectious agents because transfer of inactivated pathogen structures to the MHC-I pathway is mediated by the particle to be phagocytosed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSecond, the modified particle can accommodate a large amount of different cargo molecules, which together with the avid phagocytosis, ensures very effective transfer of antigens to the MHC-I pathway of professional antigen presenting cells. Furthermore, there is no restriction on the molecular size of antigenic structures, as the particle to be phagocytosed can accommodate whole inactivated virus particles. Additionally, the large surface area of the particle to be phagocytosed, such as zymosan, would allow for the attachment of compounds that potentiate the phagocyte response to the antigen, such as CpG motifs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThird, zymosan for example, due to its inherent phagocyte stimulating capacity as a microbial compound, in itself should have potent adjuvant properties, which is a perquisite for the induction of a primary CD8 T cell response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFourth, because antigen uptake happens via the phagocytic route, it is to be expected that part of the antigenic material would be presented simultaneously via the MHC class II pathway, which would ensure induction of a concomitant CD4 T cell helper response, which in turn is required for a productive CD8 T cell response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLastly, ready to use vaccines may be prepared within a short period of time without the requirement for specialized equipment, provided appropriate antigenic material is available.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention can be used in both a prophylactic context as well as a therapeutic one. For a prophylactic vaccine, the polypeptide component as part of the compositions disclosed herein that is delivered to an antigen presenting cell is designed to trigger an immune response against the polypeptide/antigen. A therapeutic vaccine is also designed to provoke an immune response, but in individuals already affected with the disease or disorder. The present invention contemplates both prophylactic and therapeutic uses of the compositions disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention come into contact with phagocytic cells either in vivo or in vitro. Hence, both in vivo and ex vivo methods are contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs for in vivo methods, the compositions of the present invention are generally administered parenterally, usually intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. They may be administered, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. In ex vivo methods, monocytic cells are contacted outside the body and the contacted cells are then parenterally administered to the patient.\n\n\n \nExamples\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following non-limiting examples are given by way of illustration only and are not to be considered limitations of this invention. There are many apparent variations within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nAntigenic Stimulation of B3Z Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nThe phagocytosis carrier system is based on yeast cell wall particles that have been chemically modified to allow escape from the phagosome and release of covalently attached cargo molecules into the cytoplasm. The technical feasibility of this approach is exemplified in an in vitro model system for the presentation of a model peptide structure derived from ovalbumin (OVA) to a reporter MHC-I restricted CD8 T cell hybridoma line (B3Z), recognizing the internal OVA peptide sequence SIINFEKL. See, Shastri, N., and Gonzalez, F. 1993. \nJ. Immunol. \n150:2724.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults indicate that neither the soluble OVA nor the modified zymosan carrier alone caused stimulation of the B3Z hybridoma in the presence of MHC-I matched IC-21 presenting cells. Efficient antigen presentation, however, was observed with the zymosan-coupled OVA peptide (see induction of Î²-galactosidease reporter gene for T cell activation). Stimulation of B3Z cells was dependent on both phagocytosis and correct proteolytic processing of the zymosan-attached OVA because neither soluble nor zymosan coupled OVA induced Î²-gal reporter activity in the absence of IC-21 presenting cells. See \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese data demonstrate that efficient transfer of zymosan-coupled OVA to the cytoplasm as well as correct proteolytic processing via the proteosome and loading onto MHC-I molecules.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nExperimental Model Systems for Testing Vaccination Efficacy\n\n\n \n \n \nThree principal experimental mouse model systems can be used to analyze the efficacy of zymosan-particle based vaccines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a first model system, a simple defined model protein antigen like OVA or Î²-gal is coupled to modified zymosan, induction of a cytolytic CD 8 T cell response is the readout, and established OVA or Î²-gal transfected, syngeneic tumor cell lines are the target cells for an in vitro assay of cytolytic T cell activity and an in vivo protection against tumor challenge. This model system allows the investigator to define the most basic parameters of vaccination, including dosage and vaccination schedule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe second system model system is for vaccinating with complete viruses coupled to a modified yeast cell wall particle. As a model antigen, Moloney viruses would be attractive candidates because these retroviruses are known to rapidly cause sarcomas in various mouse strains which, after initial regression, prove lethal in most cases. As a readout system for this model, various established murine Moloney virus-transformed leukemia cell lines are used as model target cells both for in vitro cytolytic assays as well as in vivo tumor protection or tumor therapy assays. Furthermore, direct protection against virus-induced sarcoma formation may be used to assay vaccine efficacy in this model. This model system is also particularly attractive because retroviruses have been found to be involved in oncogenesis both in experimental animal systems and in humans, and in the case of HIV-1 are the causative agent of AIDS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe third model system is for tumor vaccination with lysed tumor cells as the model antigen coupled to a modified yeast cell wall particle. The experimental readout system is in vitro cytolytic T cell activity against the tumor cells and both tumor protective and therapeutic efficacy in vivo."

Although specific reference is made to epithelial defects following photorefractive keratectomy, embodiments of the present invention can be used to treat epithelial defects from other causes, for example corneal abrasions, trauma, keratoconus, penetrating keratoplasty and dystrophies.\n\n\n[0003] The eye includes several tissues that allow patients to see. The cornea of the eye is an anterior tissue of the eye that is clear in healthy eyes and refracts light so as to form an image on the retina. The retina is a posterior tissue of the eye that senses light from the image formed thereon and transmits signals from the image to the brain. The cornea includes an outer layer of tissue, the epithelium, which protects the underlying tissues of the cornea, such as Bowman's membrane, the stroma and nerve fibers that extend into the stroma and Bowman's. The healthy eye includes a tear film disposed over the epithelium. The tear film can smooth small irregularities of the epithelium so as to provide an optically smooth surface. The tear film is shaped substantially by the shape of the underlying epithelium, stroma, and Bowman's membrane, if present. The tear film comprises a liquid that is mostly water and does include additional components, such as mucoids and lipids. The many nerve fibers of the cornea provide sensation to promote blinking that can cover the cornea with the \n\n tear film. The never fibers also sense pain so that one will normally avoid trauma to the cornea and also avoid direct contact of an object to the cornea so as to protect this important tissue.\n\n\n[0004] In the healthy cornea, the proper amount of hydration of the cornea, sometimes referred to as dehydration of the cornea, is maintained such that the cornea remains clear. The cornea includes a posterior endothelial layer that pumps water from the cornea into the adjacent anterior chamber. The epithelium minimizes flow of water from the tear liquid into the cornea, such that the corneal stroma can be maintained with the proper amount of hydration with endothelial pumping. The endothelial pumping of water from the cornea to maintain the proper hydration and thickness of the eye is often referred to as deturgescence.\n\n\n[0005] In patients with epithelial defects, the barrier function of the epithelium is compromised, such that water can enter the cornea through the epithelial defect so as to cause swelling of the corneal stroma. As a result, excessive hydration of the cornea may occur in eyes with epithelial defects. In some instances, excessive hydration that swells the corneal stroma can result in light scattering, or haze, such that an image seen by a patient is degraded. The scattering of light by the corneal stroma can be seen with a slit lamp examination to diagnose the patient, and is sometimes referred to as corneal haze. In addition to potentially causing excess hydration of the cornea, an epithelial defect can expose the nerve fibers of the cornea such that the patient feels pain. [0006] Several known techniques exist to treat corneal epithelial defects, including bandage therapeutic lenses, non-steroidal antiinflammatories (hereinafter NSAIDS), steroids, antibiotics and analgesics. These known techniques may be somewhat effective in reducing symptoms associated with the epithelial defect. However, many of these known techniques may not provide a barrier to water entry into the corneal stroma, such that the cornea may swell with water and may affect patient vision in at least some instances. For example, a bandage therapeutic lens may be placed over the epithelial defect to cover and protect the corneal tissues under the defect, such as the corneal stroma and nerve fibers. However, in at least some instances the bandage therapeutic lens may not prevent water of the tear from leaking through the epithelial defect into the stroma. Also, a bandage therapeutic lens may slide over the epithelial defect when positioned on the eye in at least some instances, potentially decreasing the therapeutic benefit of the therapeutic lens when the lens slides along the delicate underlying tissue, for example when a patient blinks. \n\n [0007] Work in relation to embodiments of the present invention suggests that at least some of the known therapeutic bandage lenses used to treat epithelial defects may actually contribute to corneal edema and pain in at least some instances. At least some of the current bandage lenses may provide less oxygen than would be ideal, and decreased oxygen to the cornea may be related pain and corneal edema in at least some instances. Also, in at least some instances, bandage lenses may be fit loosely on the cornea, such that water can go around the bandage lens and may penetrate the stroma through the epithelial defect.\n\n\n[0008] Although analgesics such as lidocaine may reduce pain, the overuse of these treatments can delay regeneration of the epithelial tissue over the defect, such that the defect may last longer. Consequently many people with epithelial defects may feel pain and have degraded vision while the epithelial defect heals.\n\n\n[0009] Many people elect to undergo laser vision correction surgery to treat refractive error of the eye, such as near sightedness. With one form of this surgery known as photorefractive keratectomy (hereinafter \"PRK\"), a large area of the epithelium is removed, for example a 6 mm area. Following ablation of the underlying tissues such as the corneal stroma and/or Bowman's membrane, the epithelium grows back over the ablation to cover the area where the epithelium was removed. This re-growth of the epithelium can take three to four days, and at least some of the patients who undergo this surgery may feel pain. In addition, the epithelium may be somewhat irregular while growing back over the corneal stroma, and the irregularities may degrade patient vision in at least some instances. Further, work in relation to embodiments of the present invention suggests that anterior stromal edema, ablated surface irregularities and necrotic cells in the ablated surface area may decrease vision in some instances. Therefore, improved treatment of epithelial defects may result in improved patient comfort and vision following PRK, and possibly other surgeries that remove the corneal epithelium.\n\n\n[0010] In light of the above, it would be desirable to provide improved treatments for epithelial defects of the cornea. Ideally, these treatments would avoid at least some of the deficiencies of known techniques while providing improved patient comfort and/or vision while the epithelial defect heals.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0011] The present invention is generally directed to visual rehabilitation and treatment of pain for patients with epithelial defects on the cornea of the eye. Although specific reference \n\n is made to epithelial defects following photorefractive keratectomy, embodiments of the present invention can be used to treat epithelial defects from other causes, for example corneal abrasions, trauma, keratoconus and corneal dystrophies. Embodiments of the present invention can provide patients having epithelial defects with improved hydration of the cornea and improved vision with decreased pain.\n\n\n[0012] Embodiments of the present invention provide a therapeutic covering for the treatment of an epithelial defect of a cornea of an eye, in which the cornea comprises a stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. The covering may comprise a layer of a therapeutic material positionable over the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane of the eye. The layer can be positionable over the eye to reduce pain, for functional vision through the layer, to inhibit and/or minimize swelling of the cornea, and/or so as to decrease light scatter of the cornea. The layer can be configured to reduce pain in many ways, for example by covering exposed nerve fibers and/or by adhering to the stroma and/or Bowman's so as to inhibit, in some embodiments minimize, rubbing of the layer on the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane where nerve fibers may be located. The layer may be configured for positioning on the eye with mechanical resistance sufficient to resist a blink of the eyelid, and this resistance may decrease pain by inhibiting motion of the covering over corneal nerve fibers. The layer can be configured for functional vision through the layer in many ways, for example configured to contact the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane for a plurality of days so as to inhibit and/or minimize, swelling of the cornea and/or so as to inhibit and/or minimize light scatter from an anterior surface of the cornea. The layer may comprise an index of refraction so as to inhibit and/or minimize light scatter from the anterior surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. The layer can be configured to inhibit and/or minimize swelling of the cornea in many ways, for example with a hyperosmotic solution, a hydrophobic liquid and/or a matrix material that inhibits and/or minimizes water flow from the tear liquid to the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. The layer may be configured to inhibit and/or minimize swelling of the cornea for a plurality of days when positioned on the eye, and the layer may restore deturgescence of the cornea. In some embodiments, the layer is configured to inhibit and/or minimize swelling of the cornea so as to inhibit and/or minimize light scatter from the stroma and /or Bowman's membrane. The layer may comprise an index of refraction to inhibit and/or minimize light scatter from an anterior surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. The layer may be configured for the eye to view through for a plurality of days when positioned on the eye. The layer can be configured to adhere to the stroma and/or \n\n Bowman's membrane. The layer may comprise a curved anterior surface that corresponds to the anterior surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane to within about +/- 1 D, for example with post-PRK patients, such that the lens with the curved anterior surface comprises a lens to correct vision of the patient when the epithelium regenerates. The layer of therapeutic material can be positioned on the eye in many ways, for example with a covering that is placed on the eye or with a spray that is cured to adhere the layer to the exposed surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. In many embodiments a thin layer sprayed on the corneal surface may comprise a curved anterior surface of the therapeutic layer that corrects patient vision. In some embodiments, a therapeutic lens disposed over the layer of therapeutic material may comprise a curved anterior surface that corrects patient vision.\n\n\n[0013] The therapeutic covering may comprise oxygen permeability sufficient to restore deturgescence of the cornea, for example with an oxygen permeability Dk parameter of 350 or more, such that the epithelial and endothelial cell layers have oxygen for epithelial regeneration and endothelial pumping to restore deturgescence, respectively. The covering may comprise a hydrophobic water barrier layer disposed between a hydrophilic lower surface to contact the cornea and a hydrophilic upper surface to contact the tear film. An outer portion of the covering may be configured to form a seal with the epithelium such that the covering can be adhered to the cornea with endothelial suction of the covering onto the epithelial defect. As the endothelial suction may not immediately adhere the covering to the cornea, the covering may be held in place with another mechanism initially. For example, a contact lens may be placed over the covering to hold the covering against the epithelial defect, and the contact lens removed after the covering is adhered to the cornea with endothelial suction, for example removed after one hour or less.

The cover may comprise a layer of therapeutic material positionable \n\n over the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. A person or ordinary skill in the art may refer to Bowman's membrane as \"Bowman's\". The cover may minimize water flow into the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane, such that corneal deturgescence can be restored and can decrease light scattering when the epithelium regenerates. The layer of therapeutic material can cover and protect nerve fibers so as to decrease pain felt by the patient. The layer may comprise an index of refraction to inhibit or minimize light scatter from an anterior surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane, for example with an index of refraction that matches the index of refraction of the anterior surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. The cover may comprise a curved anterior surface that corresponds to the anterior surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane, for example with post-PRK patients, such that the curved anterior surface comprises a lens to correct vision of the patient when the epithelium regenerates. The lens on the anterior surface of the layer may correspond to the optical power of the anterior surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's to within about +/- 1 Diopter. The layer of therapeutic filler material may comprise a solid, an adhesive, a gel, a low adhesion gel, and/or a liquid with therapeutic properties. The layer of therapeutic material can be positioned on the eye in many ways, for example with a spray that is cured to adhere the layer to the exposed surface of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. In many embodiments a thin layer sprayed on the corneal surface may comprise the curved anterior surface of the therapeutic lens that corrects patient vision. In additional embodiments, a therapeutic lens disposed over the layer of therapeutic material may comprise the curved anterior surface of the therapeutic lens that corrects patient vision, and the therapeutic lens may comprise a posterior surface with a curvature that fits the curvature of the epithelium.\n\n\n[0503] The therapeutic covering as described herein can be used with many corneal surgeries. For example, the therapeutic covering can be used with surgery of the cornea where an incision is made, and the covering used to shape the cornea when the cornea heals, for example with penetrating keratoplasty, also referred to as PKP.\n\n\n[0504] As used herein, a lens encompasses at least one light transmitting body with two opposite surfaces with optical properties suitable for forming images. A therapeutic contact lens encompasses a lens that can be worn on the cornea of the eye. In many embodiments the lens may comprise little or no refractive power when placed on the cornea.\n\n\n[0505] As used herein the stroma and/or (the) Bowman's encompasses: the Bowman's membrane or the stroma, or both. For example, the ablations and coverings described herein \n\n can be used to cover one of Bowman's membrane or the stroma following laser ablation, or both. With PRK, for example, both the stroma and Bowman's can be ablated, such that the ablated surface includes an exposed surface of Bowman's membrane and an exposed stromal surface such that the covering contacts both the stroma and Bowman's membrane. In some instances, Bowman's membrane may be ablated such that the coverings described herein may cover mostly stromal tissue, for example with a deep PRK ablation of about 150 um. With a very shallow PRK ablation, for example to about five microns, the ablated surface in a human cornea may comprise Bowman's membrane without exposed stromal tissue.\n\n\n[0506] A tie layer encompasses a layer that can be optically clear, and adhere the lens, itself or other \"layer\" to the cornea, for example to at least one of the stroma, the epithelium or the conjunctiva.\n\n\n[0507] Work in relation to embodiments suggests that edema can be caused by both a decreased water barrier function and decreased oxygenation of the cornea. The thin lens covering can provide pain management both mechanically and metabolically. From a mechanical standpoint, the thin lens covering can provide a barrier against rubbing between the debrided zone and the inside of the eye lid. The thin lens covering may also comprise a barrier sealed against the epithelium so as to inhibit or minimize water entering the debrided area. From a metabolic standpoint, the thin lens covering comprises oxygen permeability so as to provide the amounts of oxygenation helpful for corneal epithelium healing. The oxygenation can also be sufficient for increased endothelial pumping and associated metabolism that may occur in response to the epithelial defect. For epithelial re-growth of the debrided epithelium, the oxygen requirement of the epithelium growing over the defect can be much higher than for intact epithelium. Without adequate oxygenation, the epithelium may shift the metabolic pathway away from producing the carbon dioxide to producing lactic acid. The lactic acid can cause hyperosmosis in the epithelial and stromal layers and draw water into these layers which, in turn, may cause the cornea to swell. The decreased oxygen of the cornea may also cause nerve activation manifested by pain, for example nerve activation due to increase swelling. Embodiments can provide a therapeutic covering with a high oxygen permeability, for example a Dk of at least about 350. In at least some embodiments the Dk of the covering comprises a value of 400 or more, for example a Dk of at least about 500. This increased permeability can decrease swelling associated with the metabolically active epithelium when the epithelium regenerates over the debrided cornea. \n\n [0508] The therapeutic material and/or layer as described herein may comprise permeability to water no more than about 50 % more than a healthy cornea, or about 1.5 times the permeability of the cornea, for example about no more than 25% more than a healthy cornea, or 1.25 times the permeability of the healthy cornea, such as the cornea prior to ablation. The permeability of the cornea, for example the permeability of the corneal epithelium, can be expressed as a quantity of water per unit area of the cornea per unit time. The permeability of the cornea to water may comprise the permeability of the corneal epithelium to water.\n\n\n[0509] The therapeutic device may be used as a drug delivery platform. At least one of the therapeutic materials or the therapeutic lens may comprise a therapeutic agent. The therapeutic agent may comprise at least one of an analgesic, an anti-inflammatory, an antibiotic, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, a steroid or an epithelial growth factor to enhance epithelialization.

Endothelium 18 comprises a layer of cells that pump water from cornea 10 as indicated by arrows 19. Tear liquid 13 also covers surfaces of the cornea that are exposed by the epithelial defect, such as an exposed surface of Bowman's membrane I4E and an exposed stromal surface 16E. [0513] In a normal healthy eye, epithelium 12 is disposed across cornea 10 and is a protective layer. Epithelium 12 covers nerves of the cornea and minimizes the flow of water from the tear film of the eye to into the stroma. Epithelium 12 in most human patients can be about 40 to 60 microns thick, for example about 50 microns. When epithelium 12 is intact, endothelium 18 can pump water from stroma 16 and maintain hydration in the cornea at a proper level. The mechanism by which the stroma of the cornea remains properly hydrated can be referred to as deturgescence. Deturgescence of the cornea can be important because excess hydration of the cornea can result in swelling of the cornea and light scattering, or haze, that can degrade vision. The total thickness of normal cornea 10 from endothelium 18 to tear liquid 13 in most human patients can be from about 400 to 600 microns. A healthy cornea with normal hydration comprises about 80 to 85% water. Edema of the cornea due to swelling of the cornea, for example with additional water can increase, the thickness of the cornea. \n\n [0514] With refractive surgery, for example PRK, the epithelium can be removed to ablate a refractive correction into Bowman's membrane 14 and/or stroma 16. An initial profile 22 of the anterior surface of stroma and/or Bowman's membrane is ablated to an ablated profile 20 to correct the patient's vision. The profile of tissue removed to correct vision is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5, 163,934, entitled \"Photorefractive keratectomy\", the disclosure of which may be suitable for combination in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention described herein. Ablated profile 20 generally comprises an optical zone that extends across the cornea to correct refractive error of the eye and may correct aberrations of the eye, for example wavefront aberrations. Ablated profile 20 is bounded by boundary 2OB that may circumscribe the ablated profile. The epithelium grows centripetally from circumscribing boundary 12B toward the center of ablated profile 20 to cover the exposed stroma, as indicated by arrows 30.\n\n\n[0515] Fig. I B shows application of a therapeutic filler material 130 to an eye to form a protective coating to the eye while the epithelium regenerates. Filler material 130 can be applied to the eye in many ways, for example with an aerosol spray 1 10 comprising small particles directed toward the anterior exposed surface of cornea 10. Although an aerosol spray is shown, filler material 130 can be formed in many ways, for example by application of a drop of liquid that spreads on the eye, for example with surface tension and/or a therapeutic lens mold. Filler material 130 may comprise a two component system with a polymer component and a cross-linker component. The two components may be applied separately, for example by separate application, or simultaneously, for example with a mixed aerosol spray. Filler material 130 can be applied over ablated profile 20. Filler material 130 can be applied over epithelium 20 with a peripheral flap 120 that can facilitate removal of filler material 130 when epithelium 12 regenerates centripetally as shown by arrows 30, as shown in Fig. I C.\n\n\n[0516] The therapeutic filler material can be applied in many ways. The therapeutic filler material can be applied as a spray onto the cornea post PRK, with a layer thin enough to match PRK contour and thick enough to smooth roughness of the post ablation contour at the interface of the filler material and stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. The filler material can be applied with an inkjet deposition process, for example with separate cartridges for each component of two component system. Microparticles of the filler material can be applied, for example microparticles of collagen. The filler material can build up over time with deposition to make the therapeutic layer and/or lens. The shape of the layer can be \n\n customized based shape on an intended shape, for example a customized lens shape with computer controlled deposition profile. Application of material to the eye is described in U.S. Pub No. 2004/0170666 in the name of Keates, the disclosure of which may be suitable for combination with some embodiments of the present invention described herein. Known electrospray aerosol generators can be used to generate nanoparticles. For example a known electrospray generator is available from TSI that is capable of generating 3 nm particles with a density as high as 10\n7\n particles per cm\n3\n.\n\n\n[0517] Fig. 1C shows a therapeutic lens 150 comprising a layer 130L of filler material 130 as in Fig. I B, in which the filler material has been cured to form a tie layer 140. Lens 150 comprises an optical surface 152 that is smooth to improve patient vision. Tie layer 140 comprises a lower surface 142, or posterior surface, that is adhered to the stroma and/or Bowman's along ablated profile 20. This adherence of tie layer 140 allows tie layer 140 to remain on the cornea when the epithelium regenerates, so as to provide a therapeutic barrier.\n\n\n[0518] Fig. ICl shows optical smoothing of a corneal surface and barrier protection with therapeutic lens 150 comprising optical surface 152. Filler material 130 and/or tie layer 140 comprise a thickness 132. Thickness 132 can be sufficient to inhibit or minimize passive transport of water, for example by diffusion, from the tear film near the anterior surface through filler material 130 and/or tie layer 140 to ablated profile 20 as indicated by arrow 158. Optical surface 152 corresponds to abated surface 20 over an optically useful portion of ablated surface 20, for example at least about a central 3 mm of ablated surface 20.\n\n\n[0519] The permeability to water of filler material 130 and/or tie layer 140 may be no more than about 50% more than the pumping capacity of the endothelial layer. For example, the permeability of the filler material and/or tie layer may be no more than about 50% more than the permeability of the intact epithelium.\n\n\n[0520] Optical surface 152 comprises an anterior surface of layer 130L and/or tie layer 140 and is sufficiently smooth to provide functional vision while the epithelium regenerates, for example a visual acuity of 20/40 or better for driving, for example 20/25 or better. Filler material 130 and/or tie layer 140 comprises thickness 132 extending from ablated surface 20 to optical surface 152 that is sufficient to smooth irregularities 201 of ablated profile 20. Irregularities 201 can include peaks 2OP and valleys 20V. Such irregularities may be caused by the ablation of tissue and may be present prior to ablation for example with naturally \n\n occurring roughness of Bowman's membrane and/or roughness of an exposed surface of the cornea following debridement of the corneal epithelium.\n\n\n[0521] Anterior optical surface 152 comprises a profile, for example a curvature profile, that corresponds to ablated profile 20 so as to correct vision of the patient, for example with an anterior surface profile that corresponds to a refractive and/or wavefront ablation profile. Thickness 132 can be substantially uniform such that the profile of anterior optical surface 152 corresponds to ablated profile 20 and smoothes irregularities 201. For example, thickness 132 can be within a range from about 1 micron to about 200 microns, as noted above, and thickness 132 can vary from a mean value by no more than about +/- 10 microns over an optically useful portion of the layer, such that the anterior surface of therapeutic layer 130 and/or tie layer 140 corresponds to ablated profile 20. An optically useful portion of the layer may comprise a distance that is no more than about 3 mm across, for example about 2 mm across.\n\n\n[0522] Filler material 130 comprising layer 130L and/or tie layer 140 may comprise an index of refraction close to the index of refraction of the cornea so as to inhibit or minimize the optical effect of these irregularities. Cornea 10 may comprise an index of refraction of about 1.376 to about 1.377. The tear liquid has an index of refraction of no more than about 1 .34, for example no more than about 1.337. Work in relation to embodiments of the present invention indicates that this difference in the index of refraction of about 0.04 may be sufficient to degrade patient vision with irregularities 201 at the interface of the tear film and stroma when the tear film covers ablated profile 20. The difference between the index of refraction of the material in contact with the cornea can be minimized so as to improve patient vision. Filler material 130 comprising layer 130L and/or tie layer 140 may comprise an index of refraction that is close to the index of refraction of the cornea from about 1.34 to about 1.42, for example from about 1.36 to about 1.40, such that vision is improved. The index of refraction of the filler material and/or tie layer may be from about 1.37 to about 1.39 so as to substantially match the index of refraction of the cornea.\n\n\n[0523] Thickness 132 and filler material 130 can be selected to inhibit or minimize the permeability of water to within the above amounts and to smooth ablated profile 20. The thickness of layer 130L of filler material 130 and/or tie layer 140 can be from about 1 micron to about 200 microns, for example from about 2 microns to about 50 microns. Filler material 130 can cure to form tie layer 140 so as to inhibit or minimize permeability of water and may \n\n comprise known adhesives such as a fibrin based adhesive, a polyethylene glycol based adhesive, an albumin based adhesive, a cyanoacrylate based adhesive, and/or modified proteins with activated functional groups and a multi-arm branched pre-polymer based adhesive. Many of these known adhesives are commercially available as TissealTM, CosealTM, DurasealTM, BioglueTM, ArterXTM, , NeomendTM, DermabondTM,\n\n\nHistocrylTM and OcuSealTM. Many known adhesives may comprise a two component system with a protein and/or polymer component and a cure components, such as a fibrin based adhesive, a polyethylene glycol based adhesive, an albumin based adhesive, many of which may comprise a cure component with gluteraldehyde. A two component system may comprise a cross-linker and a branched pre-polymer. The hydration of many of these materials can be adjusted prior to curing so as to provide an index of refraction within the above ranges and/or that matches the index of refraction of cornea.\n\n\n[0524] The adhesive may comprise a two component system. A first component may comprise protein and/or a prepolymer component. The protein may comprise, for example, fibrinogen, and the prepolymer may comprise, for example polyethylene glycol. A second component may comprise a catalyst and/or a cross-linker, for example glutaraldehyde. The therapeutic layer may be soaked in the protein and/or prepolymer, and the catalyst and/or cross-linker may be applied to the exposed tissue of the eye, for example the stroma and/or Bowman's. The therapeutic layer can then be positioned on the exposed tissue such that the first component reacts with the second component so as to adhere the therapeutic layer to the exposed tissue. In some embodiments, the therapeutic layer may be soaked in the catalyst and/or cross-linker, and the protein and/or pre-polymer applied to the exposed tissue, for example the stroma and/or Bowman's. The therapeutic layer can then be placed on the eye. At least one of the first component or the second component may comprise a photosensitizer for tissue welding and/or photoactivated curing.\n\n\n[0525] Layer 130L comprising filler material 130 may comprise photosensitizers for curing filler material 130 with light to form tie layer 140. Photosensitizers can include ultraviolet (hereinafter \"UV\") or blue light photosensitizer such as riboflavin, IR photosensitizer such as indocyanine green, visible light photosensitizers such as Janus green, rose Bengal and methlyene blue, known protein crossl inking agents such as heterobifunctional with at least one photoactivated group. The photosensitizers can be used to cure the therapeutic material. The photosensitizer can be used to adhere and/or to weld therapeutic material to the tissue. U.S. Pat.

The donor tissue may comprise homologous donor tissue, and in some embodiments may comprise autologous donor tissue. Known methods of preparing a donor cornea can be used. The donor cornea \n\n may comprise an artificial human cornea capable of innervation when placed on the cornea. In some embodiments, the donor cornea may comprise a xenograft, for example porcine or bovine cornea.\n\n\n[0529] Layer 130 may comprise a therapeutic agent. The therapeutic agent may comprise at least one of an analgesic, an anti-inflammatory, an antibiotic, a non-steroidal antiinflammatory, a steroid or an epithelial growth factor to enhance epithelialization.

The therapeutic layer may comprise human recombinant material, for example fibrogen. The therapeutic layer material may comprise collagen plus a polymer, for example a neoglycopolymer-crosslinked biopolymer matrix, a biosynthetic matrix, collagen hydrogel, for example collagen with poly ether amide (PEA) hydrogel and collagen with acrylate. Collagen based materials that may be used in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention are described in the following US patents and patent applications: 4,452,925; 4,983,181 ; 5,213,720; 5,522,888; 5, 1 14,627; 5,716,633; 5,836, 3 13; 6,645,715; 2006/0034807; US2006/013050;\n\n\nUS2006/0134170; 2006/02461 13; and 2007/002046, the disclosures of which may be suitable for combination in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention described herein. In some embodiments, homologous tissue from a human cell line may be used, for example a human fibroblast cell line, and cross-linked with a cross-linker. The therapeutic layer may comprise known human or mammal-derived amniotic membrane, such as\n\n\nAmbioDry2â¢ from IOP Inc. of Costa Mesa, California, EpiFixâ¢ from Surgical Biologies of Kennesaw Georgia, AcelaGraftâ¢ from Oasis of Glendoar, California, and AmnioGraftâ¢ \n\n from Bio-Tissue of Miami, Florida, a solution comprising amniotic membrane tissue repair and growth factors, or ground up amniotic membrane. The therapeutic material may comprise an optically clear material, for example as described in US20030187515, US20040048796, the disclosures of which may be suitable for combination in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention described herein.\n\n\n[0532] The above donor and collagen based materials can be stabilized and/or solidified by soaking in a photosensitizer, for example riboflavin, and exposed to light so as to induce photocatalyzed crossl inking, for example with UV or blue light.\n\n\n[0533] II. C. SYNTHETIC The therapeutic layer lens material may comprise a known synthetic material, for example porous hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) hydrogel, hydrogel, silicone, for example hydrated silicone and derivatives thereof.\n\n\n[0534] ADHESION OF THERAPEUTIC LAYER TO BOWMAN'S MEMBRANE AND/OR THE CORNEAL STROMA [0535] The adhesive can hold the therapeutic layer in place on the cornea as the epithelium grows over the anterior surface of the therapeutic layer. The adhesive can be applied in many ways.\n\n\n[0536] GLUE\n\n\n[0537] In many embodiments, the adhesive comprises an adhesive glue. The adhesive glue may comprise many known surgical sealants. The adhesive may comprise a synthetic adhesive, a natural or biologically derived adhesive, a hybrid adhesive, and/or a recombinant adhesive. The synthetic adhesive may comprise, for example, poly-lysine, cyanoacrylate, and/or polyethylene glycol. The natural or biologically derived adhesive may comprise, for example, known fibrin adhesive. The hybrid adhesive may comprise, for example, albumin with glutaraldehyde, and/or modified proteins with activated functional groups, such as such as succinylated collagen. The recombinant adhesive may comprise recombinant fibrin bio- derived from plasma and/or poly-lysine.\n\n\n[0538] In specific embodiments, the adhesive may comprise a fibrin and/or fibrinogen adhesive, commercially available as Tissealâ¢. The adhesive may comprise a two part component. For example, the fibrinogen component can be placed on cornea, the therapeutic \n\n layer soaked in thrombin, then applied to cornea so as to form fibrinogen and covalently bond the therapeutic layer to the exposed Bowman's and/or stroma, for example with a collagen or collagen based therapeutic layer.\n\n\n[0539] The optical clarity of the fibrin adhesive may be modulated by altering the fibrin structure (solid phase) within the fibrin gel, for example when the adhesive is sprayed onto the eye to form a layer with a thickness from about 5 to 100 microns. This may be accomplished by altering the gelation time (thrombin concentration between 1 -1000 units/mL) or by altering the ionic strength of the liquid phase of the gel. A more opaque (\"coarse\") gel is created by lower ionic strength and slower gelation times (low thrombin concentration). A clear or \"fine\" gel can be made by increasing the ionic strength or decreasing the gelation time (almost instantaneous at a high thrombin concentration, while several minutes at a low thrombin concentration). As gelation time usually is preferably consistent for a given medical application, it may be more convenient to alter the ionic strength of the liquid phase by increasing or decreasing the salt concentration (as an example, if using sodium chloride, the concentrations range between 0-500 mM). For example, lyophilized thrombin may be reconstituted in a low ionic strength buffer with the requisite calcium chloride (required for covalent crosslinking of the resultant gel by the transamidation reaction of Factor XIlI) in order to create a more opaque gel. To create an optically clear gel, a higher salt concentration buffer system (e.g., saline at twice or more physiological concentration) with calcium chloride can be used. Other ways of altering the ionic strength can be by use of compatible salts and buffers such as potassium chloride, calcium chloride, tris buffer, carbonate buffer, and the like. Alternately or in combination, sugar-based solutions can be used such as dextrose. Dextran solutions can also be used to alter the ionic strength. The buffer/salt solution can be used in either the fibrinogen component or the thrombin component, though it is most convenient to reconstitute and dilute the thrombin component in order to attain the desired gel time. The above can be used to spray an optically clear and optically transmissive layer on the eye such that a patient has functional vision of 20/40 or better, for example 20/25 or better.\n\n\n[0540] The adhesive may comprise polyethylene glycol (PEG) based adhesive, for example commercially available under the trade names Cosealâ¢ and Durasealâ¢. The PEG components may be placed on cornea, the therapeutic layer soaked in catalyst, for example a higher pH solution, and the therapeutic layer then applied to cornea. \n\n [0541] Albumin based glue is commercially available and can be obtained commercially under the trade name Bioglue TM\n\n\n[0542] Cyanoacrylate is commercially available and can be obtained commercially with the trade name Dermabondâ¢ and Histocrylâ¢. Commercially available methylmethacrylate can be obtained and may be used.\n\n\n[0543] The glue may comprise BSA-GTA know as BioglueTM, available from Cryolife; BSA-GTA glue known as ArtexTM, commercially available from Tenaxis Medical; polysaccharide multi-arm glue known as OcuSealTM, commercially available from Hyperbranch Medical; and PEG-based glue known as ProPEGTM and NeoMendTM.\n\n\n[0544] Many of the above adhesive glues, for example Fibrinogen and/or PEG based glues can be disposed as a dry material on the therapeutic layer, such that moisture from the cornea cures the glue when the adhesive is placed on the cornea.\n\n\n[0545] The therapeutic covering comprising the layer may comprise at least one of a synthetic adhesive, a natural and/or biologically derived adhesive, a recombinant adhesive or a hybrid adhesive or derivatives thereof. The synthetic adhesive may comprise, for example, a least one of a polylysine adhesive, a cyanoacrylate adhesive or a polyethylene glycol adhesive or derivative thereof. The natural and/or biologically derived adhesive may comprise, for example, at least one of a fibrin adhesive or an RPG adhesive or derivatives thereof. The recombinant adhesive may comprise, for example, at least one of a fibrin adhesive, a polylysine adhesive, a biologically derived adhesive from plasma or an RPG adhesive or derivatives thereof. The hybrid adhesive may comprise, for example an albumin with glutaraldehyde adhesive.\n\n\n[0546] TISSUE WELDING\n\n\n[0547] Optical tissue welding can be used to adhere the therapeutic layer to the stroma and/or Bowman's. A light sensitive material comprising a photo sensitizer may be disposed in the therapeutic layer, in the cornea, and or between the cornea and therapeutic layer, for example within an indentation of the therapeutic layer. Light is applied to the therapeutic layer, for example with a laser beam. The applied light interacts with the photo sensitive material and welds the tissue. Although light welding is shown, other welding such as thermal and electrosurgical welding may be used in some embodiments. \n\n [0548] Many photosensitizers may be used and wavelengths of light may be used to initiate photo-chemical reactions and/or chemical bonding with an appropriate flux of the light energy. The corneal therapeutic layer material described above may be combined with the photosensitizer to adhere the therapeutic layer to the stroma and/or Bowman's, for example to form a covalent bond with the stroma and/or Bowman's. In some embodiments, UV or blue light may be used, for example with riboflavin as a photosensitizer with an appropriate flux of the light energy distributed over an area. Infrared (IR) light may be used with indocyanine green photosensitizer. Visible light and visible light photosensitizers, for example Janus green, rose Bengal and/or methylene blue may be used. Examples of known photo-sensitizers are described in US Patent Nos. 5,552,452; 6,607,522; and 7,077,839, the disclosures of which and may be suitable for combination in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention described herein.\n\n\n[0549] Table 1 shows examples of photosensitizers and laser sources that may be used.\n\n\n[0550] TABLE 1 Photosensitizer Laser Source Wavelength\n\n\nRiboflavin-5-phosphate Argon 488-514 nm Rose Bengal Krypton Red 600-670 nm Porphyrins Argon/Krypton/ 488-5 14 Tunable Dye Lasers 546, 600-670 nm [0551] Table 1 is merely an example of some of the electromagnetic radiation wavelength that may be used to achieve photo-activation, which may generally have a wavelength from about 10 nm to about 700 nm and will be within the visual, infra red or ultra violet spectra. The radiation may be supplied in the form of a monochromatic laser beam or other form of electromagnetic radiation source. The choice of energy source can be made in conjunction with the choice of photosensitizer employed in the composition. For example, an argon laser may be particularly suitable for use with flavins such as riboflavin-5-phosphate, i.e., flavins are optimally excited at wavelengths corresponding to the wavelength of the radiation emitted by the argon laser. For similar reasons, a diode laser can be suitable for use with chlorophylls such as bacteriochlorophyll A.\n\n\n[0552] There are at least two major types of sensitized photo-\n1\n oxidative processes, for example Type I and Type II. The sensitizer in its ground state can first absorb light energy to form S\nx\n and T\nx\n which may comprise sensitizer molecules in their excited singlet and triplet \n\n states, respectively. Both Type I and Type II reactions can then proceed via the triplet state because it has a much longer lifetime than the singlet state.\n\n\n[0553] In many Type I reactions, the sensitizer triplet T\nÎ\n can then directly bind to the substrate to produce substrate free radicals or radical anions. The substrate radicals then can undergo further reactions, including that with molecular oxygen to form the superoxide anion O\n2\n- . The superoxide anion then can react in numerous ways. For example, the superoxide anion can further react to generate hydrogen peroxide (H\n2\nO\n2\n) and the hydroxyl radical (OH\n*\n) .\n\n\n[0554] In Type II reactions, the sensitizer triplet may react first with molecular oxygen to produce singlet oxygen (\n1\nO\n2\n) . The singlet oxygen can then oxidize the substrate to form photo-oxidation products. Direct electron transfer from triplet to oxygen can also occur to yield superoxide anions, but in some instances much less efficiently.\n\n\n[0555] Photosensitizers can then cause oxidative damage to susceptible amino acid residues, for example histidine, tryptophan, tyrosine, cysteine, and methionine. They may cause non-disulfide covalent cross-links in susceptible proteins. This process can be oxygen dependent and may be mediated by singlet oxygen rather than by superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, or hydroxyl radicals. Natural collagen can be devoid of disulfide bridges. Embodiments of the present invention enable one to produce non-disulfide covalent crosslinks within collagen when exposed to light so to adhere an onlay to the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane.\n\n\n[0556] In at least some embodiments of the present invention, water soluble photosensitizers that have high quantum efficiency for singlet oxygen production can be selected. These photosensitizers may include rose bengal (excited by the argon laser) , riboflavin-5-phosphate (argon laser) , porphyrins (argon/krypton) and methylene blue (krypton laser). The photosensitizer can then be mixed with a protein solder, applied to the wound, and exposed to the appropriate laser. An 18% fibrinogen solution may have the right consistency for ease of application and dissolved all photosensitizers without problem. Welded fibrinogen may resorb in vivo (Oz and Chuck et al. , 1989), and may be a good substrate for an organic glue in embodiments where resorbtion is used such that the onlay is temporarily adhered with the adhesive, for example prior to integration and/or re- epithelialization.

The photosensitizers of Table 2 can be combined with many of the onlay materials described and/or adhesives described herein to form a material suitable for adhesion to the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane.\n\n\n[0558] Adhesion of a therapeutic layer can be used to hold the therapeutic layer in place while an adhesive sets. A photosensitizer may be disposed under the therapeutic layer and tack welded with laser and/or other light to weld the therapeutic layer to the tissue. In some embodiments, an additional adhesive may be employed, for example delivered with a deliver tool near the periphery of the therapeutic layer. The tack welds can hold the therapeutic layer in place while the adhesive sets. In some embodiments, an annular track of adhesive may be disposed on the therapeutic layer as described above, and used with tack welding of the therapeutic layer with light.\n\n\n[0559] PROTEIN CROSS-LINKING AGENTS\n\n\n[0560] Many protein cross-linking agents may be used, for example adhesives as described above. In some embodiments, a heterobifunctional with a photoactivated group and a cross- linking group can be employed so as to cross-link the layer to the Bowman's membrane and/or stroma with covalent bonds in response to photo activation with an appropriate flux. In some embodiments, the cross-linking agent may crosslink the therapeutic layer to Bowman's membrane and/or the stroma without photoactivation.\n\n\n[0561] Fig. 1 C2 shows regeneration of the epithelial layer with centripetal advancement of the epithelial layer under therapeutic lens 150. Regenerated epithelium 1 12 comprises a leading edge 1 12A that advances centripetally as shown by arrows 30. Filler material 130 and/or tie layer 140 comprise peripheral flap 120 that allows the epithelium to advance centripetally under and dislodge a peripheral portion of the filler material and/or tie layer while a central portion of the filler material and/or tie layer remains adhered to the cornea. \n\n This adherence of a central portion of the filler material and/or tie layer while the peripheral portion is dislodged allows the filler material and/or tie layer to inhibit or minimize water transport into the cornea and provide good vision through the adhered portion. The epithelium continues to regenerate centripetally and dislodge filler material 130 and/or tie layer 140 with leading edge 1 12A near the center of ablated profile 20. When the epithelium substantially covers the cornea so as to provide a natural barrier to water and natural smoothing of most of ablated profile 20, therapeutic lens 150 can be completely dislodged from the cornea, for example when the epithelial defect is no more than about I mm across.\n\n\n[0562] Fig. 2A shows application of a therapeutic filler material 230 to an eye with an aperture 210A disposed in a blocking material 210 so as to form a protective coating to the eye when the epithelium regenerates. Aperture 210A can be shaped so as to apply filler material 230 to the eye over the exposed corneal surface and/or Bowman's membrane. A layer 230L of filler material forms over the exposed corneal surface and/or Bowman\n'\ns membrane. Filler material 230 can be applied to the eye in many ways, for example as described above, and with aperture 210A disposed between the cornea and source of aerosol, for example with an aerosol spray 220 comprising small particles directed toward the anterior exposed surface of cornea 10. Although an aerosol spray is shown, filler material 230 can be formed in many ways as described above. Filler material 230 may comprise a two component system, as described above. Filler material 230 can be applied over ablated profile 20 so as to inhibit or minimize deposition of the filler material on the epithelium, as this may allow the epithelium 12 to regenerate over the cured filler material.\n\n\n[0563] Fig. 2B shows a therapeutic lens 250 comprising a layer 230L of filler material 230 as in Fig. 2A, in which the filler material has been cured to form a tie layer 240. Lens 250 comprises an optical surface 252 that is smooth to improve patient vision as described above. Optical surface 252 corresponds to ablated surface 20 over an optically useful portion of ablated surface 20, for example at least about a central 3 mm of ablated surface 20. Tie layer 240 comprises a lower surface 242, or posterior surface, and an upper surface 244, or anterior surface. Lower surface 242 is adhered to the stroma and or Bowman's along ablated profile 20. This adherence of tie layer 240 allows tie layer 240 to remain on the cornea when the epithelium regenerates, so as to provide a therapeutic barrier and therapeutic optical surface.\n\n\n[0564] Fig. 2B I shows optical smoothing of a corneal surface and barrier protection with therapeutic lens 250 comprising optical surface 252. Filler material 230 and/or tie layer 240 \n\n comprise a thickness 232. Thickness 232 can be sufficient to inhibit or minimize transport of water from the anterior surface near the tear film through filler material 230 and/or tie layer 240 to the stromal ablated profile 20 as indicated by arrow 258. Optical surface 252 corresponds to ablated surface 20 over an optically useful portion of ablated surface 20, for example a central 3 mm of ablated surface 20.\n\n\n[0565] The permeability and optical properties of filler material 230 and/or tie layer 240 can be similar to filler layer 130 and/or tie layer 140 described above.\n\n\n[0566] Optical surface 252 can be sufficiently smooth to provide functional vision while the epithelium regenerates, similar to optical surface 152 described above. [0567] Filler material 230 and/or tie layer 240 may comprise an index of refraction similar to filler layer 130 and/or tie layer 140 described above.\n\n\n[0568] Thickness 232 and filler material 230 can be selected to inhibit or minimize the permeability of water to within the above ranges and to smooth ablated profile 20, as described above. Work in relation to embodiments of the present invention suggest that epithelium 12 can grow over filler material 230 and/or tie layer 240 when the thickness is within a range from about 1 um to about 100 microns, for example from about 2 microns to 50 microns. As the irregularities of the cornea can be small, a thickness of about 1 um can provide optical smoothing and provide a barrier. In some embodiments, thickness 232 can be within a range from about 3 microns to about 25 microns, for example from about 4 microns to about 10 microns, and provide a therapeutic barrier and therapeutic optical surface. Filler material 230 can cure to form tie layer 240 so as to inhibit or minimize permeability of water may comprise materials similar to filler material 130 described above. Filler material 230 may comprise at least one of a silicone oil or a perfluorocarbon based oil.\n\n\n[0569] Fig. 2C shows regeneration of the epithelial layer with centripetal advancement of the epithelial layer over therapeutic lens 250. Regenerated epithelium 212 comprises a leading edge 212A that advances centripetally (as shown by arrows 30) over lens 250. Filler material 230 and/or tie layer 240 can be disposed within boundary 12B so as to allow the epithelium to advance centripetally over the filler material and/or tie layer while the filler material and/or tie layer remains adhered to the cornea. This adherence of the filler material and/or tie layer allows the filler material and/or tie layer to inhibit or minimize water transport into the cornea and provide good vision when the epithelium advances centripetally. The epithelium continues to regenerate centripetally and cover filler material 230 and/or tie \n\n layer 240 centrally with leading edge 212A near the center of ablated profile 20, when the epithelium substantially covers the cornea so as to provide a natural barrier to water and natural smoothing of ablated profile 20. In many embodiments, filler material 230 and/or tie layer 240 may comprise a biodegradable material that erodes when the epithelium is disposed over the filler material and/or tie layer. The biodegradable filler material and/or tie layer may comprise at least one of collagen, fibrin or degradable polyesters such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid and polycaprolactones. In some embodiments, filler material 230 and/or tie layer 240 may comprise an implantable material that remains in the cornea after the epithelium covers the implantable material. The implantable material may comprise many of the materials described above with reference to filler material 130 an/or tie layer 140. The implantable material may comprise known implantable materials, for example perfluorocarbons, polyethylene, polypropylene.\n\n\n[0570] Fig. 2D shows a therapeutic lens 299 and regeneration of the epithelial layer with centripetal advancement of the epithelial layer as a portion 295 of therapeutic lens 299 sloughs off the cornea. Therapeutic lens 299 comprises an anterior optical surface, similar to optical surfaces 152 and 252 described above. A layer 280L of filler material 280, similar to layer 130L, layer 230L, filler material 130 and filler material 230, can be applied to the cornea and cured to form a tie layer 290, similar to tie layer 140 and tie layer 240 as described above. Tie layer 290 comprises a lower surface 292, or posterior surface, and an upper surface 294, or anterior surface. Regenerated epithelium 262 comprises a leading edge 262A, for example a leading edge circumscribing the adhered portion of the lens, that advances centripetally and dislodges and/or fractures filler material 280 and/or tie layer 290, such that portion 295 sloughs from lens 299 as the epithelium advances centripetally. As the epithelium continues to advance additional portions can slough from layer 280L and/or tie layer 290. A thickness 282 of filler material 280 can be similar to thickness 132 and thickness 232, described above. Filler material 290 may comprise filler materials similar to filler material 230 described above.\n\n\n|0571] Fig. 3A shows application of a therapeutic filler material 330 to an eye. Filler material 330 can be applied to the eye in many ways, for example with a drop of liquid applied to the eye from a syringe such that the drop spreads over and covers the epithelial defect of the eye. Filler material 330 can be applied to the eye with an aperture 31 OA disposed in a blocking material 310 so as to form a protective coating to the eye while the epithelium regenerates. Aperture 31 OA can be shaped so as to apply filler material 330 to \n\n the eye over the exposed corneal surface and/or Bowman's membrane. Filler material 330 can be applied to the eye in many ways with aperture 310 disposed between the cornea and source of aerosol, for example with an aerosol spray 320 comprising small particles directed toward the anterior exposed surface of cornea 10. Although an aerosol spray is shown, filler material 330 can be applied to form layer 330L in many ways. Filler material 330 may comprise a two component system, as described above. Filler material 330 may be applied to ablated profile 20 so as to inhibit or minimize deposition on the epithelium. Filler material 330 may comprise the filler materials described above.\n\n\n[0572] Fig. 3B shows molding the filler material 330 as in Fig. 3A with mold comprising a lens 360 to form a therapeutic lens 350 in situ on the cornea. Therapeutic lens 360 may comprise known therapeutic lens materials such as low water content silicone material, for example no more than about 25% water content, high water content silicone material, for example at least about 25% water content, polymethylmethacrylate (hereinafter \"PMMA\"), hydrogel material, or other materials, either singly and in various combinations (i.e. \"copolymers\"): HEMA 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate; MA methacrylic acid; MMA methyl methacrylate; NVP N-vinyl pyrrolidone; PC phosphorylcholine; PVA poly vinyl alcohol; PVP polyvinyl pyrrolidone and a hard therapeutic lens, for example comprising PMMA or one or more of the following materials, either singly or in combination, gas permeable therapeutic lens are harder/stiffer and are silicone based, but have greater oxygen permeability than the soft lenses and include these singly and in copolymer: DMA N,N- dimethylacrylamide; HEMA 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate; MA methacrylic acid; NVP N- vinyl pyrrolidone; TPVC tris-(trimethylsiloxysilyl) propylvinyl carbamate; NCVE N- carboxyvinyl ester; PBVC poly[dimethylsiloxyl] di [silylbutanol] bis[vinyl carbamate]; PVP polyvinyl pyrrolidone. The therapeutic lens comprising a hard lens material may reduce lens pressure on the wound, for example when the patient blinks. Lens 360 comprises a lower surface 362, or posterior surface, and an upper surface 364, or anterior surface. Lower surface 362 is shaped to fit on the cornea and form therapeutic lens 350 with a desired shape. Lower surface 362 comprises a peripheral portion 362P shaped to fit over the unablated cornea, for example with a radius of curvature that corresponds to the radius of curvature of the cornea. Lower surface 362 comprises a central portion 362C shaped to correspond to the ablated profile 20, for example with a radius of curvature that corresponds to the intended post ablation curvature of the cornea, such as a curvature within about +/- 1 D of the intended optical power of the curvature of ablated profile 20. With wavefront ablations that ablate a \n\n wavefront shape on the eye, the curvature of the wavefront ablation can comprise the lower order corrections of the wavefront ablated profile such as sphere and/or cylinder.\n\n\n[0573| Filler material 330 can be cured to form tie layer 340, similar to the curing of tie layers described above. Tie layer 340 comprises a lower surface 342, or posterior surface, and an upper surface 344, or anterior surface. Lower surface 342 is adhered to the stroma and or Bowman's along ablated profile 20. This adherence of tie layer 340 can allow layer 340 to remain on the cornea when the epithelium regenerates, so as to provide a therapeutic barrier and therapeutic optical surface as described above.\n\n\n[0574] Fig. 3B l shows detail of the lens 360 used to mold the therapeutic lens 350 as in Fig. 3B. Peripheral portion 362P of lower surface 362 comprises a peripheral radius of curvature Rp that corresponds to the pre-operative radius of curvature of the cornea. Work in relation to embodiments of the present invention indicates that most human patients can be fit with Rp within about 2 D of the curvature of the cornea, based on keratometer readings, for example with curvatures corresponding to corneal powers of about 42 D, 44 D and 46 D. Patients can be fit with Rc within about 1 D, for example about 0.5D, of the curvature of the cornea, based on keratometer readings, for example with curvatures corresponding to post ablation corneal powers from about 35 D to about 50 D in about 0.5 D increments. In the exemplary embodiment, 3 values of Rp can be selected and 32 values of Rc can be selected, such that a kit comprising about 96 lens can be used to select a lens for the patient. Central portion 362C of lower surface 362 comprises a central radius of curvature 362C that corresponds to the intended post operative curvature of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. A circumscribing boundary 362B, for example an annular boundary, extends around central portion 362C along peripheral portion 362P.\n\n\n[0575] Therapeutic lens 350 can be molded in situ on the cornea with the mold comprising therapeutic lens 360 position over the cornea. Peripheral portion 362P is aligned with the unablated periphery of the epithelium. Central portion 362C is aligned with ablated profile 20. Filler material 330 is configured to form tie layer 340. Tie layer 340 comprises a lower surface 342 configured to adhere to the stromal tissue exposed with ablated profile 20 and Bowman's membrane near boundary 2OB. Tie layer 340 comprises an upper surface 344. Upper surface 344 can be configured for removal of the mold comprising therapeutic lens 360. In some embodiments, the mold comprising therapeutic lens 360 may comprise a high water content therapeutic lens, a PTFE coating and known low adhesion and/or low friction \n\n surfaces, for example a polished surface, such that therapeutic lens 360 can be removed from tie layer 340 when tie layer 340 is adhered to the anterior stroma and/or Bowman's membrane that defines ablated profile 360.\n\n\n[0576] Fig. 3C shows therapeutic lens 350 comprising tie layer 340 with the mold comprising therapeutic lens 360 removed. Therapeutic lens 350 may comprises a thickness 332 for optical smoothing, to inhibit or minimize water transport into the cornea and to protect tissue the anterior stroma and/or Bowman's membrane, as described above. Tie layer 340 may comprise materials and thicknesses as described above.\n\n\n[0577] Fig. 3D shows molding of the therapeutic lens 350E with a tie layer 340E comprising a flap 320E formed over the epithelial layer. Lens 350E can be formed with the mold comprising therapeutic lens 360. Filler material 330E, similar to material 330, can be applied over the peripheral epithelium as described above. The mold comprising therapeutic lens 360 can be positioned over the filler material, such that filler material 330E is disposed over the intact epithelium 12. Filler material 330E can be cured to form tie layer 340E comprising flap 320E. Tie layer 340E comprises a lower surface 342E, or posterior surface, an upper surface 344E, or anterior surface. Lower surface 342E comprises a peripheral portion 342EP and a central portion 342EC. Upper surface 344E comprises a peripheral portion 344EP and a central portion 344EC. A circumscribing boundary 344EB extends around central portion 344EC between the central portion and peripheral portion. Central lower surface 342EC is adhered to the anterior stroma and/or Bowman's having ablated profile 20. The central upper surface may comprise an anterior optical surface as described above. Thickness 332E is sufficient to provide optical smoothing, minimize water transport from the tear to the stroma and protect the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane as described above. [0578] Filler material 330E can be cured to form tie layer 340E, as described above. Tie layer 340E comprises a lower surface 342E, or posterior surface, and an upper surface 344E, or anterior surface. Lower surface 342E is adhered to the stroma and or Bowman's along ablated profile 20. This adherence of tie layer 340E can allows to layer 340E to remain on the cornea when the epithelium regenerates, so as to provide a therapeutic barrier, a therapeutic optical surface and decreased pain, as described above. \n\n [0579] Fig. 3E shows therapeutic lens 35OE with the mold comprising therapeutic lens 360 removed. The epithelium can grow under flap 320E with centripetal advancement of the epithelium as described above.\n\n\n[0580] In situ molding on the cornea may comprise the steps of placing a filler material on the cornea, placing a mold on the cornea, curing the filler material to form a tie layer, and removing the mold. In situ molding is described in U.S. Pat.

Lens 392 may comprise a therapeutic lens shaping surface 392. Surface 392 may comprise a non-adhesive and/or low friction coating, as described above. Although at least one channel 396 is shown to inject material centrally, the at least one channel may be disposed to inject material peripherally, and may comprise multiple channels.\n\n\n[0582] Fig. 4A shows application of a therapeutic filler material 430 to an eye with an aperture 410A disposed in a blocking material 410 so as to form a protective coating to the eye while the epithelium regenerates. Filler material 430 may comprise the filler material, as described above. Aperture 41 OA can be shaped so as to apply filler material 430 to the eye over the exposed corneal surface and/or Bowman's membrane. Filler material 430 can be applied to the eye in many ways with aperture 410 disposed between the cornea and source of aerosol, for example with an aerosol spray 420 comprising small particles directed toward the anterior exposed surface of cornea 10. Although an aerosol spray is shown, filler material 430 can be applied in many ways, as described above. Filler material 430 may comprise a two component system, as described above. Filler material 430 can be applied over ablated profile 20 so as to inhibit or minimize deposition on the epithelium. In some embodiments, filler material 430 can be applied over the epithelium, for example to form a flap as described above. \n\n [0583] Fig. 4B shows molding filler material 430 as in Fig. 4A with a mold comprising a therapeutic lens 460 to form a layer 430L of therapeutic material 430. Layer 430L comprises a thickness 532. Layer 430L may comprise a therapeutic lens 450 formed in situ on the cornea. Therapeutic lens 460 may comprise known therapeutic lens materials such as low water content silicone material, for example about 25% water content, high water content silicone material, for example about 25% water content, polymethylmethacrylate (hereinafter \"PMMA\"), hydrogel material, and a hard therapeutic lens material such as PMMA. The therapeutic lens comprising a hard lens material may reduce lens pressure on the wound, for example when the patient blinks. Therapeutic lens 460 comprises a lower surface 462, or posterior surface, and an upper surface 464, or posterior surface. Lens 460 comprises a thickness 466. Upper surface 464 comprises a central portion 464C over the ablated profile 20 and a peripheral portion 464P. A boundary 464B extends around central portion 464C between the central portion and peripheral portion 464P. Upper surface 464 comprises an anterior surface of the therapeutic lens and can be separated from the ablated surface with ablated profile 20 with a distance 468. Central portion 464C comprises a radius of curvature that corresponds to the radius of curvature of ablated profile 20 of the stroma so as to provide optical correction for the patient. Lower surface 462 can be shaped to fit on the cornea and form therapeutic lens 450 with a desired shape.

The tie layer may comprise a first adhesive over the debrided stroma and/or Bowman's membrane, and a second adhesive disposed over the conjunctiva. The first and second adhesive may comprise the adhesives described herein. For example the first adhesive may comprise fibrin and the second adhesive may comprise 5 cyanoacrylate to adhere the therapeutic lens to the cornea.\n\n\n[0624] The therapeutic lens may comprise a hard therapeutic lens so as to make contact with the cornea so as to allow for adhesion to the tie layer and prevention of fluid, for example tear liquid, introduction into the interface between the lens and cornea and may prevent or decrease subsequent stromal edema. The lens may comprise a lens custom fit to I O the patient with a first radius of curvature to fit the conjunctiva and a second radius of curvature to fit the cornea so as to inhibit or minimize a gap between the lens and cornea. Work in relation to embodiments of the present invention suggests that known hard scleral lenses may provide a gap between the cornea and hard lens so as to allow fluid to enter the epithelial defect.\n\n\n15 [0625] Fig. 1 OA shows a jet deposition system and process to form a covering comprising a therapeutic layer in situ on an exposed corneal surface. The system may also be used to form a covering on a substrate for subsequent placement on the Bowman's membrane and/or stroma. The system comprises a processor 1000 and a jet forming device 1002 coupled to the processor to control the jet forming device in response to commands from the processor. The 0 processor may comprise an input device such as a keyboard. Data for the deposition process can be entered with the input device.

The at least one cartridge 1010 may comprise three cartridges for example cartridge A 101 OA, cartridge B and cartridge C. Each cartridge may comprise components for forming the therapeutic layer, for example components of the adhesives and/or materials as described above. The drive mechanism 101 1 may move the jet forming structure 1012 via a support 1015, so as to control the position of the jet on the eye,\n\n\n30 such that the jet can be scanned over the eye under computer along at least two directions, for example X and Y directions along the exposed surface. The jet may comprise a pulsed jet 1013 comprising the material from one of the cartridges. A sequence of pulsed jets comprising the material from the cartridges can be sequentially applied to the exposed \n\n surface of the cornea 1014 so as to form the covering comprising the layer with the desired shape, for example the desired thickness and or diameter of the layer.\n\n\n[0626] The jet may apply micro particles of collagen. The at least one cartridge may comprise a collagen cartridge similar to a cartridge for a printer. A first cartridge, for example cartridge A, and a second cartridge, for example cartridge B, may comprise components of a two component system in which the first part comprises protein and the second part curing agent. The jet deposition apparatus can build up the layer over time and sputter the therapeutic material onto the exposed surface so as to form the layer. The layer can be fabricated in situ on the eye. A third cartridge may comprise a photosensitizer. The photosensitizer can be applied with the jet to provide the photosensitizer at a level of the deposition to cure the lens and/or adhere the lens to the stroma with light activation. A light beam can be used to cure the material comprising the photo sensitizer and/or the first two components, for example the first two components from cartridge A and cartridge B, respectively. In some embodiments, the covering comprising the therapeutic layer may be fabricated on a support substrate, for example at fabrication center, similar to semiconductor processing. The therapeutic layer may comprise a customized computer based shape profile, for example a three dimensional shape profile with X-Y coordinates.\n\n\n[0627] The jet may apply micro particles comprising amniotic membrane material so as to form a covering over the eye comprising amniotic membrane material.\n\n\n[0628] Fig. 1 IA shows a method 1 100 of forming a covering comprising a therapeutic layer. A step 1 105 determines a size of the covering. The covering can be sized so as to extend across the limbus and cornea, such that the covering can be tacked down and/or adhered to the conjunctiva as described above. The covering may be sized such that a gap extends between the layer and the epithelium as described above. Intermediate sizes can also be selected. A step 1 1 10 deposits the layer. The layer can be deposit as described above. A step 1 1 15 masks and or scans the layer during the deposition process to size the layer as described above. A step 1 120 cures the layer, for example as described above. A step 1 125 deposits a photosensitizer as described above. A step 1 130 masks and/or scans the photosensitizer. A step 1 135 applies a light beam to cure the material comprising the photosensitizer. A step 1 140 masks and/or scans the light beam. A step 1 145 repeats the above steps to form the therapeutic layer on the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. \n\n [0629J It should be appreciated that the specific steps illustrated in Figure 1 I A provide a particular method of forming the layer according to one embodiment. Other steps may also be performed according to alternative embodiments. For example, alternative embodiments may perform the steps outlined above in a different order. Moreover, the individual steps illustrated in Figure 1 I A may include multiple sub-steps that may be performed in various sequences as appropriate to the individual step. Furthermore, additional steps may be added or removed depending on the particular applications. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives.\n\n\n[0630] Fig. 12A shows a therapeutic lens 1200 comprising an adhesive track for welding the therapeutic lens to the cornea. The adhesive track 1202 can comprise the adhesives and/or photo sensitizers as described above, and the therapeutic lens may comprise the therapeutic lens materials as described above.\n\n\n[0631] Fig. 13A shows a therapeutic lens 1300 with an adhesive track 1302 that may comprise a dried water soluble adhesive. The water soluble adhesive may comprise many of the water soluble adhesives as described above. The dried water soluble adhesive track can be configured to adhere to the cornea, for example the epithelium, when placed on the eye. The water from the tissue of the eye hydrates the adhesive and the adhesive adheres the therapeutic lens to the eye. The water soluble adhesive may comprise at least one of a fibrin adhesive, a polyethylene glycol adhesive or an albumin adhesive. [0632] Fig. 14 shows a light beam system 1400 to irradiate material 1406 comprising a photosensitizer. The system may comprise at least one mask 1402 and/or a scanner 1404 to irradiate the material with a pattern, for example an annular pattern. The mask may comprise non-transmitting material with a light 1408 transmitting annular aperture. The scanner may comprise a known scanner. The material may comprise material with photosensitizer as described above, for example a therapeutic lens with photosensitizer.\n\n\n[0633] Fig. 15A shows a therapeutic lens 1500 comprising structures to adhere the lens to the cornea. The lens may comprise a perimeter 1502 to increase surface area of the therapeutic lens. The lens may comprise channels with tortuosity 1504 and/or a surface tortuosity so as to increase surface area of the therapeutic lens, for a therapeutic lens comprising water.\n\n\n[0634] Many of the adhesives described above can be reversed with a removal agent. The adhesives used to adhere the layer and/or therapeutic lens to the stroma, Bowman's, \n\n epithelium and/or conjunctiva may comprise a removable adhesive that can melt when a removal agent is applied. The removal agent may comprise tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). The adhesive may comprise fibrin, such that the adhesive can melt when the removal agent is applied to the adhesive. [0635] Fig. 16A shows a composite lens 1600 comprising a first component and a second component. The first component may comprise a soft lens 1602 composed of known soft lens materials. The second component may comprise a hard lens 1604 composed of known hard lens materials. The soft component can be affixed to the second component The hard lens can be disposed under the soft lens such that the hard lens is positioned toward the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane of the eye. The hard lens may protect an ablated area from blinking of the eye. Many of the adhesives 1606 described above can be applied to the eye, for example Tisseal. The adhesive can be disposed under the two component lens such that the adhesive is disposed in contact with the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane and in contact with at least the hard lens of the two component lens so as to adhere the two component lens to the eye. Epithelium may be disposed to the periphery of the adhesive in contact with the stroma and/or Bowman\n'\ns membrane and the adhesive may extend over the epithelium in contact with the epithelium such that the adhesive adheres the second soft lens component to the epithelium. The hard lens may be sized to fit over the ablation zone with a diameter that corresponds to the size of the ablation zone, for example within about one mm of the size of the ablation zone. The soft lens may comprise a diameter greater than the hard lens, such that the soft lens can adhere to the epithelium as described above.\n\n\n[0636] Fig. 16B shows a two component lens in which the second component is configured to adhere to at least one of a cornea 1604 or a conjunctiva. The two component lens comprises a soft lens S 1602 disposed over a hard lens H. The soft lens may comprise at least one peripheral tack 1608 configured for insertion into at least one of a peripheral portion cornea or a conjunctiva. The peripheral portion of the cornea may often comprise an annular portion of the cornea disposed away from the pupil of the eye, such that the peripheral portion of the cornea may not be optically useful for vision. The hard lens may be sized to fit the ablation zone for protection, and the soft lens can be sized to extend across at least a peripheral portion of the cornea and may extend over an annular portion of the conjunctiva to the periphery of the cornea. The hard and soft lens combination can be shaped such that the two component lens comprises no more than about +/- 1 Diopter of optical power, so as to \n\n allow the patient to see with the ablated surface when the two component lens is placed on the eye, for example following PRK.\n\n\n[0637] The at least one tack may comprise many materials. The tack may comprise a bioerodible or bioabsorbable material, such that the tack adheres the lens to the cornea for a period of time, for example when the epithelium regenerates under the lens, and the material erodes or is absorbed sufficiently to release the lens from the cornea after the epithelium has grown under the lens. Many bioerodible or bioabsorbable materials can be used including poly lactic acid (hereinafter \"PLA\"). The tack can be configured to erode and/or break or be absorbed after at least three days, for example after at least one week. Alternatively, the tack may comprise a shape memory material, for example, Nitinol or a temperature sensitive shape memory alloy. The shape memory material may facilitate the removal of the lens by allowing the tack to straighten under certain conditions.\n\n\n[0638] Figs. 17A and 17B show a two component lens 1700 with a central circular first component and an annular second component. The first component may comprise a hard lens 1702 composed of a known hard lens material. The second component may comprise a soft lens 1704 composed of a known soft lens material. The first component may comprise a circular component with an outer circumference. The second component may comprise a skirt in contact with the first component. For example, the second component may comprise an annular component with an inner circumference having an inner annular diameter and an outer circumference having an outer annular diameter. The inner annular circumference of the second component can be sized to fit the outer circumference of the second component, such that the second component contacts the first component along the inner annular circumference. The first component can be sized to match the ablation zone, for example with a diameter within about 1 mm of an ablation zone. The second component may be configured to extend outward toward the conjunctiva of the eye. The soft lens may comprise at least one peripheral tack 1706 configured for insertion into at least one of a peripheral portion cornea or a conjunctiva.\n\n\n[0639] Fig. 17C shows a hard lens 1710 with anterior and posterior surface profiles that corresponds to a reshaped cornea. The anterior surface profile may track the ablated profile, such that the lens provides optical correction similar to the ablation. The posterior profile of the lens may correspond to the unablated corneal profile at the periphery as described above, such that the posterior profile tracks the unablated profile of the periphery of the eye. The \n\n lens may comprise a lens with no more than about +/- 1 Diopter of optical power, for example a piano lens with no refractive power centrally. However, the lens can be formed with many optical powers, and the center may be flat with a plateau profile. In some embodiments an adhesive may be placed below the lens to adhere the lens to the ablated bed comprising stroma and/or Bowman's membrane, for example with Tisseal adhesive.\n\n\n[0640] Fig. 17D shows a side profile view of a therapeutic lens 1700 with at least one tack 1706. The at least one tack, for example two tacks, may be normal to the posterior surface of the lens, and may be inclined inward or outward, or combinations thereof. The tacks can be inclined inwardly, for example centrally, and may be inclined outwardly toward the periphery, for example outwardly along a radius extending from center of the lens. The tack and lens may be formed from a single material, for example a rigid material such as an RGP material. The tack and lens may comprise separate materials, for example the lens may comprise known soft lens material and the tack may comprise a rigid material. Other materials include shape memory materials such as Nitinol.\n\n\n[0641] The lens comprises a central portion CP composed of an optically transmissive material for vision and a peripheral portion PP to anchor the lens over the cornea. The peripheral portion can be sized to extend over a peripheral portion of the cornea, and may even extend over at least a portion of the conjunctiva. The peripheral portion of the lens can anchor to the cornea and/or conjunctiva with the tacks. [0642] Fig. 17E shows many angles at which a tack 1706 can be positioned in relation to a therapeutic lens 1700. The tack can extend from a base on the bottom surface of the lens to a tip in a direction normal to the surface of the therapeutic lens. The tack may be inclined inward or outward as described above.\n\n\n[0643] Fig. 17F shows a bevel edge 1712 on a therapeutic lens 1700 to anchor the therapeutic lens to the tissue. The bevel edge can be configured to adhere the lens to the eye. The bevel may comprise a sharp edge 1714 that penetrates the cornea to adhere the lens to the eye or to tack the lens into the conjunctiva. The beveled edge may comprise a sharp tip to extend into tissue similar to a hypodermic needle.\n\n\n[0644] Fig. 17G shows a barbed tack 1716 with the tack configured to extend into the tissue of the eye. The barbed tack can be sized to anchor the tack in the cornea. The tack can extend a distance from the base 1718 to the tip 1720. The distance may correspond to the depth of the tack in tissue. The tack may extend no more than 400 microns, for example \n\n when the tack extends normal to the lens surface, so as to avoid penetration of the cornea. In some embodiments, the tack may be sized to extend no more than about 40 microns so as to avoid penetration of the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane.\n\n\n[0645] Fig. 17H shows a barbed tack 1716 with the barb 1722 extending from a base 1718 at the therapeutic lens to tip 1720 with the tack inclined outward. The barbed tack can be sized and positioned at many locations as described above.\n\n\n[0646] Fig. 171 shows a suction cup anchor 1724. The suction cup may comprising an indentation in the lens to adhere the lens to the tissue with suction. The suction cup may be disposed on a peripheral portion of the therapeutic lens. [0647] Fig. 18 shows optical smoothing with a two component lens 1800 positioned on an eye. The stroma 16 and/or Bowman's membrane 14 exposed for the ablation process comprises a bed with roughness. An adhesive, for example a fibrin 1802 based adhesive, is disposed over the bed 1804 to smooth the roughness, for example as described above. A two component lens can be positioned over the adhesive, for example with a first hard lens 1806 component in contact with the adhesive and a soft lens 1808 component disposed over the hard lens. The adhesive can be disposed on the bed with sufficient thickness to smooth the roughness, for example about 25 to 75 um, and the two component lens can be positioned on the adhesive such that the hard lens component is positioned over the adhesive with smoothing of the adhesive. Although a two component lens is shown, smoothing can be achieved with many of the lenses, molds and sprays, for example as described above.\n\n\n[0648] Fig. 19A shows a therapeutic covering 1900 comprising a first layer 1902 sprayed on the eye and a second layer sprayed 1904 over the first layer. The stroma and/or Bowman's membrane ablated with the laser may comprise a bed 1906 with irregularity, for example as described above. The first layer may comprise a thin layer, for example from about 1 to 25 um. The first layer may be sprayed in many ways, for example with jet deposition, electrospray, and/or apertures as described above. The first layer may comprise a hydrophobic material, for example polyethylene glycol-based material. The first layer may comprise an optically clear material and control edema, as described above. The first layer may comprise a substantially water impermeable layer that minimizes and/or inhibits the passage of water through the material into the cornea. The first layer can be sucked down onto the bed comprising the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane, for example with endothelial pumping, in a manner similar to a LASIK flap. The first layer may comprise a \n\n uniform thickness such that irregularities of the bed are transferred from a posterior surface of the first layer in contact with the bed to a posterior surface 1902PS of the first layer. The posterior surface of the first layer may contact the posterior surface of the second layer 1904PS. [0649] The second layer may comprise a smoothing layer, for example with a thickness from about 10 um to about 200 um to smooth the irregularities of the bed transferred through the first layer. The second layer may be sprayed in many ways, for example with jet deposition, electrospray, and/or apertures as described above. Thus, irregularities from the anterior surface of the first layer 1902AS in contact with the posterior surface of the second layer 1904AS can be smoothed out along the anterior surface of the second layer. This smoothing can be sufficient to provide functional vision for the patient of 20/40 or better, for example 20/25 or better. The second layer may comprise an anterior surface profile with a radius of curvature similar to the ablated bed such that the anterior surface of the second layer provides optical correction for the patient. Although the second layer is shown sprayed on the first layer, the second layer may be applied to the first layer in many ways, for example as a single drop of liquid that spreads over the first layer. The second layer may be adhered to the first layer. The anterior upper surface of the second layer can be smoothed in many ways, for example with molds, as described above.\n\n\n[0650] A therapeutic lens may be placed over the second layer, for example as described above.\n\n\n[0651] Figs. 19B l and 19B2 show epithelial growth over at least one layer of a therapeutic covering as in Fig. 19A. The epithelium 12 may grow over the first layer, for example to separate the first layer from the second layer; and the first layer may remain in contact with the bed comprising the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane when the epithelium separates the first layer from the second layer, as shown in Fig. 19Bl . The epithelium may grow over the first layer 1902 and the second layer 1904, for example when the first layer is adhered to the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane and the second layer is adhered with bioadhesive 1908 to the first layer, as shown in Fig. 19B2. The epithelium may grow under the first layer to separate the first layer from the bed comprising the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane, for example when the first layer is adhered to the second layer.\n\n\n[0652] Fig. 19B3 shows epithelial growth under the therapeutic covering as in Fig. 19A. \n\n [0653] Fig. 2OA shows a side profile view of a therapeutic lens 2000 with tacks disposed on a peripheral portion 2002 of the lens to adhere the therapeutic lens to the cornea. The therapeutic lens comprises a therapeutic covering for placement on an exposed surface of a cornea of an eye to correct vision of the eye. The therapeutic lens comprises a central optical portion 2004 for patient vision and a peripheral portion to anchor the lens to the eye. The therapeutic lens comprises an optically clear transmissive material, for example many known therapeutic lens materials can be used such as rigid, gas permeable, rigid gas permeable (RGP) and soft lens materials. The therapeutic lens comprises at least one anchor 2006 extending from a periphery of the lens to anchor the lens over the cornea. The therapeutic lens may comprise a center portion for optical effect and placement over the pupil. The peripheral portion can be sized to extend over at least a peripheral portion of the cornea, such that the peripheral portion with the tacks engage a peripheral portion of the cornea. The peripheral portion may extend to the conjunctiva and/or limbus, such that the anchor engages the conjunctiva to anchor the lens over the cornea. [0654] The at least one anchor comprises at least one peripheral tack comprising a base extending to a sharp tip, the base attached to the therapeutic lens. The tack may comprise a length from the base to the tip of about 50 urn. This size of the tack can anchor the lens in the epithelium of the cornea or in the conjunctiva without penetrating through the epithelium or conjunctiva, such that the tip of the tack is disposed over the stroma or sclera, for example without penetrating the stroma or sclera. The tack can be configured to penetrate only epithelium, for example with a length from the base to the tip of no more than about 50 microns, for example no more than about 40 microns. The tack can be configured to extend into the corneal stroma so as to anchor with collagenous tissue, for example with a depth of at least about 50 microns and no more than 500 microns, for example with a length from the base to the tip within a range from about 100 microns to 400 microns. The tip may be no more than 500 microns so as to avoid penetrating through the cornea into Descemet's membrane and/or the endothelium. The tack may be formed from a variety of materials including shape memory material such as Nitinol.\n\n\n[0655] The at least one anchor may be inclined. The at least one peripheral tack can be inclined inward toward a center of the lens.\n\n\n[0656] Fig. 2OB shows a top view of the therapeutic lens 2000 as in Fig. 2OA. The at least one anchor 2008 may comprise at least two anchors located on an annular peripheral portion \n\n of the lens. The central portion of the lens comprising an optic zone 2010 with optical correction for the patient is shown sized to fit over at least the pupil of the eye for patient vision. The at least two anchors may be symmetrically disposed around the optical portion such that at least two anchors are located on opposite sides of the central portion and pull against each other, for example the at least two anchors disposed along the vertical line. The at least two anchors may comprise equal spacing, for example equal angular and/or circumferential spacing around the central optical portion and along the peripheral portion 2012.\n\n\n[0657] Fig. 2OC shows detail of the therapeutic lens 2000 as in to Figs. 2OA and 2OB with the lens and inwardly inclined tack 2006 configured such that the lens comprises a lens spring 2014 with inward tension force to the inwardly inclined tack such that the lens force and tack anchor the lens on the eye. The therapeutic lens can be configured to urge the at least one peripherally inclined tack inward with an elastic force when the lens is positioned on the cornea. The posterior surface of the therapeutic lens 2000PS comprises a base radius of curvature. The anterior surface of the cornea 1 OAS comprises an anterior radius of curvature. The base radius of curvature of the therapeutic lens may be no more than the anterior radius of curvature of the cornea, such that the peripheral portion of the lens is urged outward by the cornea when the lens is positioned on the eye with force in the anterior to posterior direction. When released, the therapeutic lens can apply a force to the cornea with the peripheral portion, such that the inwardly inclined tack engages the cornea.\n\n\n[0658] Fig. 2OD shows a method of application of a therapeutic lens 2000 as in Figs. 2OA and 2OB. The method places the therapeutic covering comprising the lens over an exposed surface of a cornea 10 of an eye. A lens as in Figs. 2OA to 2OC is provided. The lens is placed on the eye to anchor the lens over the cornea with the at least one anchor. The lens is pushed onto the eye 2013 with at least some force, such that the lens slides along the surface of the cornea and is urged outward 2014, for example with elastic stretching of the lens material. The at least one anchor comprises at least one peripheral tack 2006 inclined inward toward a center of the lens. When the force that pushes the lens into place is removed, the lens retracts elastically 2016 so as to anchor the tack in the cornea and/or conjunctiva.\n\n\n[0659] Fig. 2OE shows detail of the therapeutic lens 2000 as in Fig. 2OA with a centrally inclined peripheral tack 2006 and removal of the centrally inclined peripheral tack. The centrally inclined tack is inclined inward relative to a 90 degree surface normal vector. This \n\n inclination can hold the lens in position, for example when the lens exerts and centripetal force on the tack. The lens can be removed with deformation and/or rotation of the lens at the periphery, as indicated by the dashed line and arrows. The removal may stretch the lens so as to retract the tack from the tissue of the cornea and/or conjunctiva.\n\n\n[0660] Fig. 20El shows the lens 2000 as in Figs. 2OA to 2OE in an initial configuration. The lens may comprise a first configuration, for example without deformation, such that the peripheral portion of the lens engages the cornea.\n\n\n[0661] Fig. 20E2 shows the lens 2000 as in Figs. 2OA to 20El in an elastically deformed configuration. The lens can be pushed into position, for example with force applied to the lens in an anterior to posterior direction, such that the peripheral portion of the lens 2000P is stretched elastically outward away from a center of the lens to assume a second configuration, for example an elastically deformed configuration, when the lens is placed on the cornea. In the deformed configuration, the radius of curvature of the posterior surface of the lens 2000R may be closer to the radius of curvature of the cornea 1 OR than when the lens is in the initial configuration without deformation. With the elastic deformation of the lens, the anchor is urged inward to engage tissue with elastic force when the lens is released.\n\n\n[0662] The therapeutic lens covering may be removed. For example, the lens may be stretched outward to pull the tack out of the corneal tissue when the lens is removed. The lens may be stretched outward to remove the tack from the conjunctiva in those embodiments where the peripheral portion is sized to anchor the tack in the conjunctiva. The tack may be formed from a variety of materials, including shape-memory materials such as Nitinol. For example, a heat-sensitive shape-memory material may facilitate removal of the lens by allowing the tack to straighten out under certain temperatures.\n\n\n[0663] Although Figs. 2OA to 2OE show a lens sized to engage the cornea with anchors of the lens, the lens can be of a larger size such that the anchors engage the conjunctiva. Such lenses can be anchored to the conjunctiva and removed with similar structures to those used to anchor the cornea and remove from the cornea.\n\n\n[0664] Fig. 2OF and 2OG show detail of a therapeutic lens similar to Figs. 2OA and 2OB with a peripherally inclined tack 2018 and insertion and removal of the peripherally inclined tack. The at least one peripheral tack can be inclined outward away from a center of the lens. The lens and outwardly inclined tack can be configured such that the lens comprises a lens spring with outward force to the outwardly inclined tack 2020 such that the lens force and \n\n tack anchor the lens on the eye. The lens can be anchored to the cornea with at least two, for example at least four, outwardly inclined tacks. The therapeutic lens may comprises a base radius of curvature on the posterior surface and the cornea comprises an anterior radius of curvature. The base radius of curvature may be greater than or equal to the anterior radius of curvature, such that the lens is flatter than the cornea. As the lens is flatter than the cornea, the lens can be deformed, or bent downward at the periphery when positioned on the eye. With this configuration therapeutic lens is configured to urge outward the at least one tack disposed on the peripheral portion with an elastic force when the lens is positioned on the cornea. The therapeutic lens may comprise an inner optical portion for placement over the pupil of the eye and an outer peripheral portion that extends over at least one of a peripheral portion of the cornea or a conjunctiva of the eye when the lens is positioned over the cornea. The at least one anchor can be positioned on the outer peripheral potion so as to extend into the epithelium of at least one of the peripheral cornea or the conjunctiva of the eye when the lens is positioned on the eye. In embodiments where the peripheral portion of the lens is sized to extend the tack into the epithelium above the cornea, the tack may be sized to extend into the cornea. The at least one anchor may have a length sized to extend into the epithelium without extending into the sclera when the outer portion of the lens is sized to engage the epithelium above the conjunctiva. The at least one anchor comprises at least four tacks disposed on the outer portion, for example as described above. The at least one anchor may comprise a variety of materials, for example, a shape memory material such as Nitinol.\n\n\n[0665] Fig. 2OH, 20H l and 20H2 show a method of application of a therapeutic lens 2000 as in Figs. 2OF and 2OG. The method places therapeutic covering comprising a lens on an exposed surface of a cornea of an eye. The lens may comprise a curved posterior surface and a curved anterior surface, such that the lens comprises no more than about one Diopter of optical power over a central optical portion of the lens. The therapeutic lens may comprise a base radius of curvature on the posterior surface 2020. The cornea may comprise an anterior radius of curvature 2022. In a first configuration as shown in Fig. 20H l , for example without deformation, the base radius of curvature may be greater than or equal to the anterior radius of curvature of the cornea. The lens may be squeezed inward 2024 toward a center of the lens to assume second configuration, for example an elastic squeezed and/or deformed configuration as in Fig. 2OH. For example, the lens can be pressed inward 2026 similar to a taco, such that the periphery of the lens is urged inward with force. In the second configuration, the lens can be placed against the cornea and released, and the therapeutic lens \n\n urges outward the at least one peripheral tack with an elastic force when the lens is positioned on the cornea and released. When released, the periphery of the lens can move outward toward the first configuration, such that the at least one anchor urges outward 2028 and engages the cornea with elastic force in the released configuration, as shown in Fig. 20H2. The therapeutic lens can be removed, and the lens can be compressed inward 2030 to remove the tack from the cornea when the lens is removed.\n\n\n[0666] Fig. 21 shows a lens 2100 configured to engage a conjunctiva with tacks 2102. The therapeutic lens can be similar to the embodiments described in Figs. 2OA to 2OE, and comprise a peripheral portion that is sized to extend at least partially over the conjunctiva 905, such that the anchor comprising the tack 2102 can extend at least partially into the conjunctiva when the lens is positioned on the eye.\n\n\n[0667] The lenses described above, for example with reference to Figs. 2OA to 2OE, can be combined with the tie layers and/or therapeutic layers described above.\n\n\n[0668] Fig. 22A shows an annular structure 2200 for use with a therapeutic lens that extends over at least a peripheral portion of the therapeutic lens to adhere the lens to cornea of the eye. The annular structure may comprise an annular band, for example a ring, configured to retain the lens of the eye. The annular band may comprise many of the adhesive materials, structures and/or anchors described above, such that the annular band is adhered to the eye when placed on the eye. [0669] Fig. 22B shows an annular structure 2200 as in Fig. 22A over a therapeutic lens 2202 to adhere the lens to the eye. The annular structure, for example an annular band, may comprise an inner diameter and an outer diameter. The therapeutic lens can be sized with a diameter greater than the inner diameter of the annular structure and less than the outer diameter, such that the annular structure extends over a portion of the therapeutic lens so as to contact the tissue and adhere the lens. The annular structure may comprise a first potion sized to contact the therapeutic lens and a second portion sized to contact the corneal tissue, for example the corneal epithelium.\n\n\n[0670] Fig. 22C shows an annular structure 2200 with tabs to adhere a therapeutic lens 2202 to a cornea. The annular structure may be similar to the annular structure of Fig. 22B and include adhesive tabs 2204 that can extend outward from the band and downward to engage tissue, such that the tabs are configured to adhere to the epithelium, for example, the epithelium over the stroma and/or conjunctiva. The tabs may comprise many of the adhesive\n\n\n1 1 \n\n materials, structures and/or anchors described above, such that the annular band is adhered to the eye when placed on the eye. The tabs may be formed from the same material and/or formed from a different material affixed to the annular structure. The tabs may comprise adhesive tape configured to adhere to the epithelium and/or the band. The annular structure 2200 can be placed over the therapeutic lens 2202 to anchor the lens on the cornea, as described above\n\n\n[0671] Fig. 22D shows a therapeutic lens with adhesive tabs 2206 to adhere to the eye. The tabs may comprise many of the adhesive materials, structures and/or anchors described above, such that the therapeutic lens is anchored to the eye when the tabs are placed on the eye. For example the tabs may comprise adhesive tape configured to adhere to the epithelium and the therapeutic lens 2202, such that the lens can be adhered to the cornea with the tape. [0672] Fig. 23A shows a therapeutic lens 2300 with a peripheral adhesive structure disposed on an upper surface of the lens, which structure 2301 extends from the upper surface of the lens past an outer periphery of the lens to contact corneal tissue so as to adhere the lens to the eye. The peripheral adhesive structure may comprise at least one of the tabs, annular structure, bands or rings described above. The inner portion 2302 may comprise a lower surface with a profile shaped to match the therapeutic lens, for example at least one of a sloped surface or a concave surface with a radius of curvature sized and/or sloped to engage the upper convex surface of the therapeutic lens. The second outer portion 2304 may comprise an adhesive surface 2306 with many of the adhesives described above.\n\n\n[0673] Fig. 23 B shows a therapeutic lens 2300 with a peripheral adhesive structure 2308 disposed on a lower surface of the lens, which structure extends from the lower surface of the lens past an outer periphery of the lens to contact corneal tissue so as to adhere the lens to the eye. The peripheral adhesive structure may comprise at least one of the tabs, annular structure, bands or rings described above. The inner portion may comprise an upper surface with a profile shaped to match the therapeutic lens, for example at least one of a sloped surface or a convex surface with a radius of curvature sized and/or sloped to engage the upper concave surface of the therapeutic lens. The second outer portion may comprise an adhesive surface with many of the adhesives described above. [0674] Fig. 24A shows a therapeutic lens 2400 comprising a suture tack 2402 to anchor the lens to the cornea. The suture may extend from a base 2404 along the lower surface of the therapeutic lens to a tip 2406. The suture may comprise a thickness and/or material to penetrate tissue. The suture may extend along a curved arc that corresponds to a radius R 2408 of curvature. The suture can extend with inward inclination from the base to the tip \n\n along the arc. The suture can extend many distances from the lower surface of the therapeutic lens. The suture may extend a distance of no more than 400 microns for example 200 microns, and may extend no more than 50 microns to adhere to the epithelium without penetrating the stroma. The suture may comprise many known suture materials, including known bioerodible or bioabsorbable suture materials. The suture may comprise a bioerodible or bioabsorbable material configured to break or be absorbed after a period of time that corresponds to re-epithelialization of the patient following PRK, for example configured to break after 3 or more days, for example after 7 days.\n\n\n[0675] The suture may be affixed to the therapeutic lens. For example the suture may be formed, for example molded, with the therapeutic lens. The suture may be inserted into the therapeutic lens after the lens is formed, for example and glued to the therapeutic lens.\n\n\n[0676] Fig. 24B shows a therapeutic lens 2400 comprising a suture tack 2410 with outward inclination to anchor the lens to the cornea. The suture may extend along an outwardly inclined arc, and may be similar to the curved suture described above. In some embodiments the erodible suture may extend normal to surface, for example as described above.\n\n\n[0677] Fig. 24C shows a therapeutic lens 2400 comprising a barbed suture to anchor the lens to the cornea. The barbed suture can be inclined inward 2412 and may comprise many of the suture characteristics described above. The barbed suture may comprise a bioerodible or bioabsorbable material such that the suture is configured to break or be absorbed and release the lens after an appropriate time, for example three days, or a week, as described above. In some embodiments, the barb can be configured to erode before the suture breaks to facilitate removal.\n\n\n[0678] Fig. 24D shows a therapeutic lens 2400 comprising a barbed suture with outward 2418 inclination to anchor the lens to the cornea. The barbed suture is similar to may of the sutures described above.\n\n\n[0679] Fig. 25A shows an external elastically deformable structure 2502 coupled to a therapeutic lens 2500 so as to adhere the lens to the eye. The elastically deformable structure may urge the tacks 2504 into tissue with force, for example with inclined tacks as described above. The elastically deformable member may comprise a band, a loop, a coil, a spring, a suture and many materials such as shape memory materials. The elastically deformable structure can be connected to the tacks, for example tacks as described above, such that the structure exerts force on the tacks. The deformable structure can be used with deformation of the therapeutic lens 2508, for example with a first configuration and a second configuration \n\n as described above, such that the therapeutic lens can be adhered on the cornea with force from the elastic structure coupled to the tacks. The structure may comprise a low profile configured to lay along the surface of the cornea and/or conjunctiva. The structure may also fit into a groove on the surface of the therapeutic lens. The tacks may comprise barbs 2510 and/or bioerodible or bioabsorbable materials as described above.\n\n\n[0680] Fig. 25B shows an external elastically deformable structure 2502 coupled to tacks 2504 inclined at opposing angles to as to adhere the lens to the eye with rotation 2512 of the elastically deformable structure. The tacks may extend from a base to a tip with opposite inclination. For example, a first tack may extend from the base to the tip in a first direction, and the second tack may extend from the base to the tip in a second direction, in which the second direction extends opposite the first direction. The external elastically deformable structure 2502 may comprise a low profile that extends along the cornea and/or conjunctiva when the lens is adhered, for example anchored, to the eye. [0681] Fig. 25C shows an internal elastically deformable structure 2502 coupled to tacks to adhere the lens to the eye. The elastically deformable structure and tacks may comprise characteristics similar to the external deformable structure described above. For example the tacks may comprise erodible sutures and/or barbs, as described above. [0682] Fig. 25D shows an external insertion tool 2514 coupled to tacks 2504 with couplings to adhere the lens 2500 to the cornea of the eye. The insertion tool may comprise a graspable loop connected to the tack so as to engage each tack with a coupling 2516 connected to the tack. The insertion tool can be separated from each tack at the coupling when the lens is adhered to the eye.\n\n\n[0683] Fig. 26A to 26D show a method of forming a therapeutic covering. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to form a first covering centrally over the stroma and/or Bowman's and a second outer covering over the epithelium. As shown in Fig. 26A a step applies a first spray 2600 comprising a first material 2602 to the eye. The first material is applied to the exposed stroma 16 and/or Bowman's 14 where tissue has been ablated. An aperture 2604 is placed in front of the eye to form a central pattern comprising a first material. Although an aperture is shown, a jet deposition spray, for example with scanning as described above can be used to deposit the first material. The first central pattern may comprise many of the shapes described above for example at least one of a layer, a lens 2601 , or a two or more layer covering. The first material may comprise an adhesive targeted to adhere to the stroma and/or Bowman's membrane, for example a fibrin adhesive commercially available as TissealTM. \n\n [0684] As shown in Fig. 26B, a step applies a second spray 2606 comprising a second material 2608 to the eye away from the ablated region I 1 of the eye where epithelium has been removed. The second material may comprise an adhesive targeted to adhere to the epithelium for example a muco-adhesive. While many adhesives may be used, muco- adhesives commercially available as PharmadurTM may be used, for example as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,814,329; 5,942,243 and 6,958, 148; and U.S. Pub No. 2004/0143026, the disclosures of which may be suitable for combination in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. The second material may comprise micro-particles to be attached to the epithelium, for example with delivery agents as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,958,158, the disclosure of which may be suitable for combination in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. The second material is applied to form the second layer on the epithelium with a desired thickness, for example as shown in Fig. 26C. Although an annular pattern is shown, the second material can be applied in many patterns, for example star shaped, cross-hatched and/or oval. In at least some embodiments, the annular pattern extends over the epithelium without extending over the ablated stroma and/or Bowman's.\n\n\n[0685] The first central material may comprise a first therapeutic agent or no therapeutic agent, and the second material may comprise a second therapeutic agent or no therapeutic agent. Work in relation to embodiments of the present invention suggests that at least some therapeutic agents can be delivered effectively over the epithelium that may not be appropriate for release over the ablated tissue surface. The use of a second material comprising a therapeutic agent targeted for placement over the epithelium can allow elution of the therapeutic agent only over the epithelium, such that specific tissues and/or effects can be targeted. For example, an epithelial growth factor can be eluted over the epithelium. In some embodiments, a therapeutic agent appropriate for the stroma can be released over the ablated stroma and/or Bowman's, for example Mitomycin C.\n\n\n[0686] As shown in Fig. 26D, a therapeutic lens 2610 may be placed over the first central 2602 material and second peripheral material 2608. The therapeutic lens may be adhered with the second material. In some embodiments, the second material may allow at least some lateral movement of the therapeutic lens, such that the therapeutic lens may be adhered with a peripheral portion as described above, for example with tacks 2612.\n\n\n[0687] The peripheral material may comprise a sticky material that sticks the therapeutic lens to the cornea so as to allow shear, or sliding, of the lens on the cornea, for example the \n\n mucoadhesive and/or micro-particles as described above. An adhesive structure sufficient to resist a blink of the eye lid can be disposed in the peripheral portion of the therapeutic lens to resist shear motion of the therapeutic lens. The adhesive structure may comprise a length sufficient to extend through the layer of second material and contact and even extend into the epithelium, such that motion of the lens from the eyelid can be resisted. The adhesive structure may comprise at least one of microstructures, setae or micro-tacks and many of the structures described above so as to limit shear motion in combination with the peripheral material.\n\n\n[0688] Fig. 27A shows a method of adhering a lens to a cornea. An adhesive spray 2700 can be sprayed, for example as described above. A mask 2702 comprising an annular aperture can be disposed between a spray source 2701 and the eye, for example as described above. A lens 2704 can be placed on the eye with at least one therapeutic layer 2706 disposed over the ablation 1 1 , for example as described above. Adhesive can be sprayed over a peripheral portion 2708 of the lens. The spray may avoid the central optical portion 2707 of the lens such that the lens remains good optical properties. The adhesive spray 2710 can be disposed in an annular pattern around the periphery of the lens to form a peripheral portion 2708 of the lens in situ, which peripheral portion anchors the lens on the cornea of the eye, for example with adhesion to the epithelium with the peripheral portion. Although an annular mask is shown, the adhesive may be sprayed in many ways, for example with scanning jet deposition as described above. The adhesive can cure on the eye to form the peripheral portion. Many adhesives described above can be sprayed onto the eye and cured to form the peripheral portion, for example a skirt, in situ.\n\n\n[0689] Fig. 28A shows a lens 2800 adhered to the cornea with protrusions comprising peripheral tacks 2802. The cornea comprises a stroma, an epithelium and an epithelial defect 1 1 . The lens comprises a plurality of apertures 2804, or holes, each of which extends through the lens and is sized to receive a tack. The tack can be formed in many ways and may comprise a tip to penetrate tissue and a barb to retain the tack and lens in place until removal. The tack can be sized and extend from the recess of the contact lens 2806 into the stroma, for example such that the tip 2808 and barb 2810 contact corneal stroma for retention, although the tack may also be sized such that the tip and barb contacts a desired tissue for retention, for example Bowman's membrane or the epithelium. The tack may comprise many materials, for example an erodible material as described above. The aperture includes a recess sized to receive a head of the tack, such that the head fits into the recess. The head of the tack fits \n\n flush with the anterior surface of the contact lens, such that irritation to the eyelid is minimized, for example when the patient blinks. In some embodiments, an additional annular structure, for example similar to the annular structure shown in Figures 22A and 22B above, can be placed over the tacks to inhibit or minimize irritation to the patient eyelid. The lens may comprise many of the lens materials described above, for example a hard lens composed of at least one of known PMMA or RGP materials, and the lens may comprise a soft lens, for example a known hydrogel lens. The lens may comprise the layer of therapeutic material, or a layer of therapeutic material can be positioned between the lens and stroma so as to cover exposed stromal tissue in the region of the epithelial defect. [0690] Fig. 28Al shows a tack 2802 for use with the lens 2800 as in Fig. 28A. The tack comprises a tip 2808 and a barb 2810 to retain the tack and contact lens with tissue. The tab comprises a head sized to fit into a recess 2806 formed in the contact lens. The tack is sized so as to extend from the head through the aperture 2804 of the contact lens, through the epithelium 12 and into the corneal stroma 16 with contact of the tip and barb in stromal tissue to anchor the contact lens.\n\n\n[0691] Fig. 28B shows a lens 2800 with protrusions 2812 to adhere the lens to the cornea. The lens comprises a central portion for vision and a peripheral portion to adhere the lens to the eye and minimize motion of the lens and therapeutic layer. The lens may comprise many of the lens materials described above, including hard lenses and soft lenses. The peripheral portion comprises a protrusion to adhere, for example to anchor or fix, the lens to the eye. The protrusion extends downward on the lens and is sized to extend into corneal tissue to adhere the lens to the eye. Although one protrusion is shown, many protrusions can extend from the lens to adhere the lens to the eye. The protrusions can be formed in many ways, for example with tacks, as described above, embedded in the lens material.\n\n\n[0692] Fig. 28B- 1 shows a protrusion 2812 comprising a tack having tip 2816 and a barb 2814 for use with lenses as in Figs. 28A and 28B. The protrusion comprises a tack having a tip and a barb, and can be sized to adhere the lens to at least one of stromal, Bowman's or epithelial tissue.\n\n\n[0693] Fig. 28B-2 shows a tack comprising a tack 2802 with a tip 2808 and a barb 2810 for use with lenses as in Figs. 28A and 28B. The tack comprises a head, a barb and a tip.\n\n\n[0694] Fig. 28B-3 shows a protrusion 2812 comprising a tack having a tip 2818 and an expanded cross section for use with lenses as in Figs. 28A and 28B. The tip may comprise a \n\n blade shaped to penetrate tissue. An enlarged cross section the expanded cross section near the tip can anchor the tack in tissue to adhere the lens to the cornea.\n\n\n[0695] Fig. 28B-4 shows a protrusion 2812 comprising a tip and an expanded cross section for use with a lens as in Figs. 28A and 28B. The tip 2820 may extend to a point shaped to penetrate tissue. An enlarged cross section the expanded cross section near the tip can anchor the tack in tissue to adhere the lens to the cornea.\n\n\n[0696] Fig. 28C shows a protrusion 2822 comprising syringe tube for use with lenses 2800 as in Figs. 28A and 28B. The syringe tube 2824 comprises openings 2826 for tissue in growth 2828. A needle 2830 can be used for at least one of insertion or removal of the syringe tube, and the needle comprises a lumen sized to receive the syringe tube.\n\n\n[0697] Fig. 28D shows a protrusion 2822 comprising syringe tube 2824 with at least one of wire 2832 or suture inserted therein for use with lenses as in Figs. 28A and 28B. The syringe tube comprises openings 2826 sized to receive and pass the wire. The wire can be inserted into the syringe tube to anchor the syringe tube in the cornea to adhere the lens to the cornea. The wire can be removed prior to removal of the syringe tube to facilitate removal of the syringe tube. In some embodiments, an annular structure, as described above, can be positioned over the lens and wires to protect the eyelid from the wires.\n\n\n[0698] Fig. 28E shows a protrusion 2834 comprising a removable wedge 2836 for use with lenses 2800 as in Figs. 28A and 28B. The removable wedge comprises elongate members 2838, for example elastic members, such that the wedge can be squeezed 2840 together for insertion and removal, for example when the protrusion passes through an aperture of a contact lens as described above. The wedge may also be at least partially embedded in the contact lens. The elastic members can urge the removable wedge outward 2842 against tissue to anchor the wedge in tissue to adhere the contact lens to the eye. The removable wedge may comprise surface structures 2844 for traction when the elastic members urge the wedge outward. In some embodiments, elongate members comprise a single piece of resilient material and the spring is provided by flexure at a bend in the material.\n\n\n[0699] Fig. 28F shows protrusions 2846 configured for twisting attachment of the lenses 2800 as in Figs. 28A and 28B. The protrusions may comprise tacks, for example as described above, embedded in the contact lens. The protrusions extend from the lower surface 2848 of the lens at an angle so as to penetrate tissue when the lens is rotated, for example twisted 2850, and pressed against the cornea. For example, counter clockwise \n\n rotation of the lens as viewed on the lower surface (clockwise for the surgeon) can result in adherence of the lens to tissue. For removal, the lens can be twisted in an opposite direction 2852, for example clockwise as viewed from the lower surface and counterclockwise for the surgeon, such that both the lens and the lens protrusions are removed from tissue. The removable wedge may function in a remotely similar way to a wall anchor for holding a screw in drywall.\n\n\n[0700] Fig. 28G shows a ring with clip attachment protrusions 2852 for use with lenses as in Figs. 28A and 28B. The ring 2854 extends circumferential Iy and may comprise clips 2856 to attach the ring. Each clip may comprise a pair of protrusions configured to extend downward into the corneal tissue. The ring can be placed on the contact lens near the rim of the lens with the clips extending into the tissue.

The shallow pins can be embedded 2860 in the lens 2800, or may extend through apertures formed in the lens. The pins can be sized to extend into at least one of stromal tissue, Bowman's membrane or epithelial tissue.\n\n\n[0702] Fig. 281 shows protrusions comprising staples 2864 for use with lenses as in Figs. 28A and 28B. The staples can be embedded in the lens 2800, and may also be sized to pass through apertures 2862 similar to the tacks described above. The prongs of each staple may extend in a substantially parallel configuration. The prongs 2866 of each staple may be configured to flare out 2868, and the prongs may be configured to flare in 2870, so as to anchor each staple in tissue. The prongs of each flared staple anchored in tissue may also be bent into the parallel configuration for removal.\n\n\n[0703] Fig. 28J shows protrusions comprising bandage clips 2872 to adhere a contact lens 2800 to the cornea. The bandage clips may be similar to known commercially available ACEâ¢ bandage clips, and sized to adhere the lens to the cornea. The contact lens can be placed on the cornea of the eye, and each clip then placed on the contact lens and cornea so as to adhere the contact lens to the cornea. The clips may also be at least partially embedded in the contact lens, for example one side of the clip, such that a portion of the clip protrudes from the lens to adhere the lens to the cornea.\n\n\n[0704] Fig. 28K shows indentations 2874 on a lower surface of a lens 2800 for attachment to the cornea. The indentations on the lower side of the lens can be shaped and sized to \n\n receive glue 2876 to adhere the lens to the cornea peripheral to an epithelial defect, similar to the embodiments described above.\n\n\n[0705] Fig. 28L shows tubing 2878 with holes 2880 for adhesive to adhere a lens 2800. The tubing may comprise a plurality of tubes disposed at many locations on the contact lens. The tubing may comprise a plurality of apertures to pass the glue into the tissue to anchor the tubing and adhere the lens. Each tube comprises at least one channel that may extend from an upper surface of the lens to the apertures to pass glue to contact the tissue, such that an adhesive glue can be injected into the tubing when the tubing is inserted into the tissue.\n\n\n[0706] Fig. 28M shows a contact lens 2800 with apertures 2882, or holes, for gluing the lens near the periphery of the lens. The hole extends from the upper surface of the lens to the lower surface of the lens, such that glue can be injected through the hole so as to contact the corneal tissue. The tacks, as described above, may also be sized to pass through the holes to adhere the lens to the cornea. The holes may pass through the lens at many angles, for example normal to the surface, inclined, inclined toward the center of the eye and inclined away from the enter of the eye.\n\n\n[0707] Fig. 28M-1 shows a channel 2884 extending normal to a lower surface of a lens 2800 as in Fig. 28M. The channel may comprise a hole, or aperture, that extends through the lens. The channel may comprise a groove that extends along the surface of the lens and may also extend through the lens. The hole may also extend vertically through the lens when the lens is placed on the eye and the patient is supine, for example during eye surgery.\n\n\n[0708] Fig. 28M-2 shows inclined 2886 channel in a lens 2800 as in Fig. 28M. The channel may comprise a hole, or aperture, that extends through the lens from an upper surface of the lens to a lower surface of the lens, such that the hole is inclined away from a center of the eye when the lens is placed on the cornea. [0709] Fig. 28N shows a clipped on lens 2888 comprising neurovascular clips 2890 supported with a suture bonded and/or molded into a lens and disposed in recesses of the lens, for example cutouts 2892. A suture can extend circumferentially around the lens to support the clips. The suture 2894 can be affixed to the lens, for example bonded or molded into the lens. The suture can support the neurovascular clips, so as to adhere the lens to the tissue when the neurovascular clips are attached to the tissue. \n\n [0710] Fig. 28O shows suture needles 2896 to adhere the lens to the cornea. The lens may comprise apertures, for example laser drilled holes 2898, sized to receive the suture needles. The holes can be inclined away from a center of the eye such that the suture needles can be passed through the holes to adhere the lens to the eye when the lens is aligned with the epithelial defect. The suture needles may also be adhered and/or bonded into the lens and extend from the lens such that the needles extend from the lens engage tissue and adhere the lens into position when the lens is placed on the eye.\n\n\n[0711] Fig. 28P shows a suture bonded 2899 to a lens, for example embedded 2899 in the lens, with protrusions of the suture extending from the lens to receive at least one of clips or needles to adhere the lens to the cornea. The suture 2899A can extend from the lens so as to define an aperture sized to receive clips or needles, for example as described above, to adhere the lens to the cornea.\n\n\n[0712] Fig. 28Q shows a suture comprising a rectangular geometry 2899B, for example a square geometry, attached to a contact lens with protrusions of the suture extending from the contact lens to adhere the contact lens to the cornea. The suture can extend from the lens to define an aperture sized to receive the clips or needles. The number of protrusions can be determined by the geometry of the suture, for example four protrusions with a square.\n\n\n[0713] Fig. 28R shows shaped Nitinol 2897 extending around a circumference of a contact lens 2800 and attached to the lens with protrusions extending from the lens at attachment locations configured to receive sutures and clips. The attachment locations, or points, can be sized to receive clips and needles to adhere the lens to the cornea.\n\n\n[0714] Fig. 29A shows a covering 2900 sucked down onto the cornea with pumping action from endothelial cells. The covering may comprise a flap, for example a silicone flap. The endothelial pumping of water from the stromal tissue, as described above, pulls the flap covering down onto the stroma and may also pull the flap covering down 2902 against the epithelium. As the stroma 16 is substantially more permeable to water than the epithelium 12, the pulling force from the endothelial pumping can be greater for the portion of the flap covering disposed over the stroma than over the epithelium. As at least some water penetrates the epithelium, the portion of the flap positioned over the epithelium can also be sucked down against the corneal epithelium, although with less force than the portion disposed over the stroma. As the epithelium grows centripetally, the flap is displaced upward and the epithelium grows inward under the flap. The flap may comprise a thin layer of \n\n material, for example no more than about 200 um, sized to cover at least part of the epithelial defect 1 1. The covering may comprise many materials and more than one layer, for example materials and layers as described above.\n\n\n[0715] Fig. 29A- 1 shows a thin flap covering 2900 at least one of sealed or adhered 2904 onto the cornea with physiologic pressure 2902 from endothelial pumping. The covering may comprise a thin lens for vision, and the lens may comprise at least a central portion of the covering. The lens can be adapted to conform to the cornea, for example adapted to conform to an exposed ablated surface of the cornea. The central portion of the thin lens covering can be adapted to conform to corneal shapes ablated into the cornea, for example wavefront aberration correction ablated into the cornea, such that the lens covering can provide good vision during healing. The thin lens covering may comprise a hydrophobic material to decrease water flow, for example to inhibit or minimize water flow, through the lens so as to decrease corneal swelling and deturgesce the cornea when the lens is placed on the cornea over the epithelial defect. The thin lens covering may also comprise a hydrophilic portion for contacting the stroma and to at least minimize sliding, even adhere, the hydrophilic portion on the stroma and to facilitate release of the lens over epithelium when the epithelium has regenerated within the zone of epithelial debridement and grown under the covering, for example with PRK patients. The thin lens covering may comprise a peripheral portion configured to seal the lens against the corneal epithelium, for example a peripheral portion configured to seal the lens against corneal epithelium away from a debrided region, for example undebrided epithelium away from an ablation zone with PRK patients. The peripheral portion may comprise a lower surface configured to form a seal against the undebrided epithelium, for example with a hydrophobic surface such as a hydrophobic surface from an elastomer such as silicone. A contact lens, for example as described above, can also be placed over the thin flap lens to hold the covering against the cornea. The thin flap lens covering may comprise many of the materials described above, for example fibrin, bioglue and tissue welding materials.\n\n\n[0716] The thin flap lens covering may comprise many known materials used for contact lenses. For example, the covering may comprise at least one of hydrogel, 2- hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA), methacrylic acid (MA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA); N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP), phosphorylcholine (PC), poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) or polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), tris-(trimethylsiloxysilyl) propylvinyl carbamate (TPVC); N-carboxyvinyl ester (NCVE); silicone hydrogel, poly[dimethylsiloxyl] \n\n di [silylbiitanol] bis[vinyl carbamate] (PBVC); silicone, silicate, plasma treated silicone hydrogel, collagen, gelatin, fibrin, bioglue, tisseal, or amniotic membrane. The hydrogel may comprise a polymeric material capable of absorbing water at least 10% by weight, when fully hyd rated.\n\n\n[0717] The thin flap lens covering may comprise cured silicone, uncured silicone, or a combination thereof. The cured silicone may comprise silicone that is two-part heat cured and RTV (room temperature vulcanized). For example, polydimethyl siloxane such as NuSiI, or poly(dimethyl) (diphenyl) siloxane may be used to mold thin flap lenses, with less than 10% water content so as to increase oxygen diffusion through the covering. A lens may comprise perfluoropolyethers or fluorofocal may work as an oxygen reservoir.\n\n\n[0718] The flap covering may comprise a silicone layer and another layer. As an example, a thinned collagen shield, such as a commercially available ProShieldâ¢ collagen shield, can be thinned down by sanding. Silicone may be positioned on one side, for example printed on or wiped on with a blade. An even thinner layer can be achieved applying silicone dissolved in solvent and then removing the solvent through methods known in the art.\n\n\n[0719] The thin flap lens covering may comprise silicone hydrogel which offers good oxygen permeability and allows for the transport of metabolites.\n\n\n[0720] The thin flap lens covering may also comprise gelatin attached thereto. The gelatin may be crosslinked, which can provide the ability to maintain the pre-formed shape of the lens, or non-crosslinked, which can offer the advantage of dispersing under the other materials of the thin flap lens covering. The gelatin may be crosslinked using glutaraldehyde, UV, or riboflavin, and many known methods of cross-linking. A heavily crosslinked gelatin on the anterior surface may be used to promote lubricity on the thin flap lens covering.\n\n\n[0721] Table HIA shows known monomers for hydrogel contact lens materials that can be incorporated with some of the embodiments described herein, and Table IHB shows known silicone-hydrogel contact lens materials that can incorporated with some of the embodiments described herein.\n\n\n[0722] Table HIA. Known hydrogel materials and lenses suitable for incorporation with embodiments of the present invention. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0723] Table IHB. Known silicone hydrogel materials and lenses suitable for incorporation with embodiments of the present invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0724] The materials shown in Table IHA and Table IHB can be modified in many ways for incorporation in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. In many embodiments, the hydrogel lenses and materials shown in Table IHA can be modified in many ways, for example to include a hydrophobic layer, such that water permeability is reduced to deturgesce the cornea, and a peripheral structure included to at least one of seal or adhere the lens to the cornea. In many embodiments, the silicone hydrogel lenses and materials shown in Table IIIB can be modified in many ways, for example to include a peripheral hydrophobic surface to suck down against the epithelium and form a seal with the corneal epithelium. The silicone hydrogel materials may comprise less hydrogel and more silicone, so as to decrease the transmission of water through the lens and increase oxygen permeability. The central portion of the above lenses and materials may also comprise a thickness of no more than about 200 urn, for example 100 um, and that is substantially uniform, such that the central portion conforms to the ablated cornea with no more than about +/- 1 Diopter of optical power from the central portion when the lens is sucked down against the cornea. Many additional modifications will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art based on the drawings and descriptions included herein.\n\n\n[0725] A contact lens may be placed over the thin flap lens covering, for example a contact lens adhered to the epithelium as described above.\n\n\n[0726] Fig. 29A-2 shows a thin covering 2900 as in Fig. 29A- 1 sized to extend beyond an epithelial debridement area 1 1. This sizing may facilitate centripetal epithelial in growth under the covering. This size may also form a seal between the covering and the epithelium 12, for example epithelium that is not debrided and includes hemidesmosomes to adhere to the epithelium to the Bowman's membrane. The covering can adhere to the cornea with a physiologic sucking mechanism. A contact lens may be placed over the covering and adhered to the cornea, for example adhered as described above.\n\n\n[0727] Fig. 29A-3 shows a thin covering 2900 as in Fig. 29A-2 size to fit an epithelial debridement area 1 1 . The covering can be sized to fit the epithelial debridement area, for example a circular debridement area. This sizing may provide a seal of the covering with the \n\n epithelium around the periphery of the covering similar to a LASIK flap. A portion of the covering may be glued to the epithelium, for example with fibrin glue, to form a hinge. A thin layer of glue may also be placed under the flap covering. Alternatively, the thin covering may be sized smaller than the debrided area. In such a case, the epithelium may grow preferentially under the thin covering. The diameter of the thin covering may be within a range from about 6 to 1 1 mm or more, and the upper limit of the diameter may be determined by the diameter of the cornea at the limbus, such that the diameter of the thin covering is sized smaller than the diameter of the cornea at the limbus.\n\n\n[0728] Figs. 29A-4 and 29A-5 shows a thin covering 2900 comprising a hydrophobic portion 2906 to decrease water flow and a hydrophilic portion 2908 to contact ablated stroma. The hydrophobic portion can control edema, for example by decreasing water flow through the covering, even inhibiting water flow through the covering. The hydrophobic portion may also prevent infection by preventing bacteria from accessing the debrided zone. The hydrophilic portion can assist in the sucking down of the flap. As the stroma comprises a hydrophilic material, a hydrophilic surface of the covering to contact the stroma can improve contact of the flap with the ablated stroma and/or Bowman's, and may even adhere the flap to stroma when the cornea is deturgesced by endothelial pumping. The hydrophilic surface of the covering can also increase friction and may decrease sliding of the covering when the cornea is deturgesced by endothelial pumping. As the epithelium grows under the covering, the hydrophilic surface of the covering may contact and hydrophobic surface of the corneal epithelium. This contact of the hydrophilic surface of the covering with the epithelium that may be hydrophobic can facilitate removal of the covering when the epithelium regenerates, and the covering can be separated from the regenerated epithelium such that the regenerated epithelium remains intact on the cornea.\n\n\n[0729] The hydrophobic portion and the hydrophilic portion may comprise, respectively, many hydrophobic and many hydrophilic materials as described herein. For example the hydrophilic portion may comprise a thin covering comprising an amniotic membrane or components of amnion. The amniotic membrane component may be formed from amniotic membranes, for example as known in the art. The amniotic membrane may comprise donor tissue which is adequately tested to prevent transmission of disease and processed so as to maximize resiliency and wound healing properties. At least one other component may be attached to the amniotic membrane. The at least one other component may comprise a second hydrophobic material, so as to help control edema and prevent tear fluid from \n\n penetrating to the epithelial defect of the eye. The hydrophobic material component may comprise a silicone polymer, for example room temperature vulcanized silicone, thinly applied by brushing or deposition onto the amniotic membrane. The hydrophobic layer may comprise a biologic tissue grown or adhered to the amniotic layer, such as an epithelial layer.\n\n\n[0730] The hydrophobic portion may be covered by a hydrophilic surface, for example plasma treated, and may also be covered by a hydrophilic layer, for example hyaluronic acid (HA). For example, the amniotic membrane may be covered by a silicone hydrophobic layer, which, in turn, is covered by a hydrophilic or lubricious coating, for example lubricious surface coatings commercially available under the trademark Isurtec , as provided by Innovative Surface Technology, Inc. of Saint Paul, Minnesota, and as available from\n\n\nSurmodics of Eden Prairie Minnesota. Other examples of plasma treatment materials include vinyl pyrrolidone, diols, ethylene glycol and tetraethyl ethylene glycol. The hydrophilic or lubricious coating can reduce friction between the thin covering and the bandage lens or the lid of the eye. The plasma treatment may increase may create a mechanical lock â a layer to seal a surface to which other material can bond â and a layer to increase wettability or lubricity. Examples of materials that can be made to bond following plasma treatment include collagen or gelatin. Plasma treatment may be further cross-linked by using glutaraldehyde. The amniotic membrane comprises an epithelial side, containing an epithelial cell layer, and a stromal or collagen side comprising fibroblast. For various reasons it may be advantageous to leave one or the other of these sides exposed to cover the patient tissue (stroma) and the other covered by a coating such as those described above. For example, the epithelium of the amniotic membrane may be covered with a hydrophilic silicone coating such that the fibroblast containing collagenous layer of the amniotic membrane is exposed for placement against the exposed stromal tissue of the patient. Alternatively, the collagenous fibroblast containing layer of the amniotic membrane may be covered with a hydrophilic silicone coating such that the epithelial layer of the amniotic membrane is exposed for placement against the exposed stromal tissue of the patient.\n\n\n[0731] Fig. 29B-1 shows a silicone flap covering 2910 comprising peripheral portion 2912 and a central portion 2914. The central portion may comprise a thin portion, for example a thin layer, of an elastic material, for example an elastomer such as silicone. The central portion can comprise a hydrophilic surface and may comprise, for example, silicone elastomer treated with surface treatment such as plasma oxidation to produce glassy islands or a 25 nm plasma coating with high reactive index. The peripheral portion can be shaped in \n\n many ways and may comprise a peripheral ring 2916 to hold the central portion in place. The peripheral portion may be more rigid than the central portion. The central portion can be configured to adhere to the cornea similar to the contact lens embodiments described above. For example the peripheral portion may comprise many of the above structures to adhere the covering to the cornea, for example including but not limited to at least one of a hydrophobic surface, protrusions, tacks, holes, channels, tubes, wedges, clips, needles, sutures or nitinol.\n\n\n[0732] Fig. 29B-2 shows a flap covering 2910 as in Fig. 29B- 1 contacting a stromal tissue surface. The stromal tissue surface may comprise an ablated stromal tissue 1 1 surface of a PRK patient. The ring 2916 can be positioned on the epithelium 12 away from the epithelial defect. The flap covering, for example the silicone flap covering, can be sucked down onto the stroma with endothelial pumping and displaced as the epithelium advances centripetally.\n\n\n[0733] Fig. 29C shows a curved covering 2920 comprising a curved central portion 2920CP adapted to conform to the cornea and a curved peripheral portion 2920PP to seal against the cornea and placement of the covering on the cornea. The peripheral portion may comprise a lower surface radius of curvature, as described above. The radius of curvature of the lower surface may comprise a value that corresponds to the radius of curvature of the cornea such that the peripheral portion of the lens is fit to the unablated cornea comprising the epithelium. The central portion can be sized to fit over the ablated cornea 1 1 and may comprise a lower surface with a radius of curvature that approximates the radius of curvature of the cornea after the ablation. For example, the radius of curvature of the central potion may be greater than the radius of curvature of the peripheral portion with a patient receiving a myopic PRK correction. The central portion may comprise a lens, for example a lens with no optical power and uniform thickness 2921 , such that the lens can conform to the ablated stromal surface. The covering may comprise a water inhibiting hydrophobic layer 2922 to inhibit or minimize corneal swelling, for example a silicone elastomer layer. The water inhibiting layer may comprise a non-water permeable layer composed of a hydrophilic material, such as silicone hydrogel that minimizes permeability of the layer to water.\n\n\n[0734] The surfaces of the covering can be configured in many ways so as to optimize the adherence of the covering to the cornea. For example, the peripheral portion 2920PP may comprise a hydrophobic surface so as to increase the coefficient of friction such that the peripheral portion comprises a sticky surface to contact and adhere to the corneal epithelium. The covering may comprise a hydrophilic layer 2924 to contact the stroma, for example a \n\n hydrophilic surface coating. The inner portion and the outer portion can be sized such that the hydrophobic outer portion contacts the intact epithelium and the inner portion contacts the stroma.\n\n\n[0735] The lens can be fit to the cornea in many ways, for example the lens covering can be selected from among of a plurality of lens coverings, such that the peripheral portion fits the undebrided epithelium. Although the peripheral portion can be fit in many ways, for example a loose fit, the fit may also comprise a tight fit to form a seal, for example with a radius of curvature of the peripheral portion fitting the radius of curvature of the cornea to within about +/-0.1 mm, or about +/- 0.5 D for a 44 D peripheral cornea. The tight fit may comprise a steep fit with the radius of curvature of the lens shorter than the radius of curvature of the cornea such that the peripheral portion of the lens that contacts the cornea is steeper than the cornea. The radius of the lens can be determined pre-operatively with known lens fitting techniques, such as fluorescein installation and slip lamp examination.\n\n\n[0736] Figs 29C l to 29C4 show a method of covering an ablated cornea with a covering, according to embodiments of the present invention.\n\n\n[0737] Fig. 29C l shows a flat casting 2926 of substantially uniform thickness 2928. The flat casting can be formed by curing a material, between plates. The material may comprise many of the materials described above, for example fibrin. The casting can be cut, for example with a trephine to form a circular covering 2930. The casting may be ablated to a desired thickness, for example with an excimer laser.\n\n\n[0738] Fig. 29C2 shows the covering comprising the circular casting 2930 positioned above the cornea, for example a post PRK cornea in a first flat configuration. The covering is aligned with the debrided region, for example the ablated region of the cornea.\n\n\n[0739] Fig. 29C3 shows the covering comprising the circular casting 2930 positioned on the cornea and conforming to corneal surface, for example the ablated stroma 16 and/or Bowman's 14 membrane. The covering is sized to fit within the epithelial defect.\n\n\n[0740] Fig. 29C4 show a contact lens 2934 positioned over the circular covering 2930. The contact lens may comprise many of the contact lenses described above. The contact lens may hold the covering in place over the epithelial defect when the epithelium regenerates.\n\n\n[0741] Fig 29C5 shows a covering 2930 for use with the method as in Figs. 29C 1 -29C4 with the covering sized to extend beyond the debrided area 1 1. This sizing of the covering \n\n may be used with a contact lens, as described above. This sizing may facilitate regeneration of the epithelium 12 over the ablated stroma 1 1 and may help to seal the covering against the cornea, as described above.\n\n\n[0742] Fig 29C6 shows in situ ablation 2936 of a covering 2930 to correct vision of a patient after ablation of the stroma 16 to correct vision. The covering can be ablated in situ on the cornea. The covering can be ablated in many ways, for example to thin the covering for conformance to the underlying stromal ablation. The covering may also be ablated so as to shape the covering with optical power to correct vision of the patient. The covering may comprise a conformable covering that conforms to the cornea when the covering is placed on the cornea.\n\n\n[0743] The ablatable covering may comprise many materials, for example as described above. The ablatable covering may comprise collagen combined with polymer such as Neoglycopolymer-crosslinked biopolymer matrix as described by US Pub. No. 2007/002046 in the name of Griffith. The ablatable covering may comprise a biosynthetic matrix as described by US Pub. Nos. 2006/02461 13; 2006/013050 and 2006/0134170 in the name of Griffith. The ablatable covering may also comprise collagen hydrogels.\n\n\n[0744] Fig. 29C7 shows ablation of a covering 2930 prior to placement on the cornea. The covering can be ablated 2938, for example to thin the covering to conform with the cornea.\n\n\n[0745] Fig. 29C8- 1 shows a curved covering 2930 adapted to conform to the cornea and placement of the covering on a debrided and ablated cornea. The covering comprises a peripheral portion 2930PP to contact the epithelium 12 and a central portion 2930CP to contact the stroma 16 and/or Bowman's. The peripheral portion of the covering can be fit to the cornea, for example as described above. The lower surface of the covering may comprise a radius, radius as described above, that is substantially similar for the central and peripheral portions.\n\n\n[0746] Fig. 29C8-2 shows the covering 2930 of Fig. 29C8-1 conforming to the ablated surface contour. The central portion 2930CP of the covering can be sucked down against the stroma 16 and/or Bowman's membrane such that the covering conforms to the ablated surface. The central portion may comprise a thin material of substantially uniform thickness to conform to the ablated cornea when the central portion is sucked down against the cornea with endothelial pumping and deturgescence. The covering may also be sufficiently thin and soft so as to conform to the epithelium 12 around the boundary of the epithelial defect. \n\n [0747] Fig. 29C8-3 shows the covering 2930 of Fig. 29C8- 1 conforming to wavefront aberrations 2940 ablated into a corneal surface to correct aberrations of the eye. The aberration ablated into the eye may comprise aberrations ablated in response to aberration measured with a wavefront aberrometer such as a known Hartmann-Shack wavefront aberrometer 2942. The aberration may comprise many known aberrations such as spherical aberrations and coma.\n\n\n[0748] Fig. 29D shows an erodible covering 2944. The covering can be configured to erode such that the cover erodes inwardly away from the regenerating corneal epithelium. The covering may comprise an outer portion, for example a peripheral portion, configured to erode at a first rate and an inner portion, for example a central portion, configured to erode at a second rate. For example, the outer portion can be configured to erode within 24 hours of placement on the eye and the inner portion is configured to erode 48 hours after placement on the eye. The outer portion erosion rate is faster than the inner erosion rate to erode the outer portion of the covering before the inner portion of the covering. Such erosion can be helpful to improve fitting of the covering to the exposed ablation surface, for example when the epithelium advances centripetally. For example, the covering may comprise a first portion configured to erode in 12 hours, a second portion 2946 configured to erode in 24 hours 2948, a third portion configured to erode in 48 hours 2950 and a fourth portion configured to erode in 72 hours 2952. [0749] The outer portion, for example the first portion, may comprise a first amount of crosslinking, and the inner portion, for example the second portion, may comprise a second amount of cross linking to erode the outer portion before the inner portion. The cross-linking can be configured in many ways, for example with known crosslinking such as that used to manufacture 12 hour, 24 hour, 48 hour and 72 hour collagen shields. A collagen shields that is known erode is the ProShieldâ¢ available from Alcon Laboratories, Inc.; such a shield can be modified to incorporate zones that erode at different times and rates.\n\n\n[0750] The outer portion and the inner portion may comprise many arrangements of portions of the covering. For example, the outer portion may comprise a first outer portion and a second outer portion peripheral to the first outer portion, and the inner portion may comprise a first inner portion and a second inner portion with the second inner portion disposed inward from the first inner portion. \n\n [0751] Fig. 29E l shows a covering 2954 with a hydrophobic layer and a hydrophilic layer. The covering comprises an upper surface 2956 and a lower surface 2958. The covering also comprises a hydrophobic layer 2960 and a hydrophilic layer 2962. The hydrophobic layer and the hydrophilic layer are each disposed between the upper surface and the lower surface. The hydrophilic layer is disposed closer to the lower surface and may comprise the lower surface, and the hydrophobic layer is disposed closer to the upper surface and may comprise the upper surface. The hydrophobic layer and the hydrophilic layer each comprise a thickness, and the thickness of each layer can be configured in many ways to enhance the performance of the covering. For example, at least one of the hydrophilic layer or the hydrophobic layer comprises at least one monolayer, and the at least one monolayer comprises a thickness 2964 of no more than about 40 nm.\n\n\n[0752] The hydrophilic layer may comprise the functions of encouraging healthy epithelial growth, taking metabolites, and cushioning the cornea. The hydrophilic layer may comprise many known hydrophilic materials, surfaces and coatings and can be formed in many ways and may comprise a known coating. Hydrophilic coatings, surfaces and materials are commercially available from Surmodics, Hydromer Biocoat, Horsham PA, Hyluran, Hydromer, and the coating may comprise hyaluronic acid (HA) coatings, monolayers and a plasma treated surface. The hydrophilic layer may comprise an optically transparent gel comprising at least about 10% water. The gel may comprise a non-water containing hydrophilic gel, for example NuSiI, a very soft silicone that can be formulated so as to promote re-epithelialization by minimizing the force needed to disconnect the stroma from the thin therapeutic covering. The hydrophilic layer may also comprise gelatin. In some embodiments, the hydrophilic layer can comprise not more than about 10 um thickness, for example about 40 nm thickness. The hydrophilic layer may also comprise dots that fulfill the above-stated functions of the hydrophilic layer.\n\n\n[0753] The hydrophobic coating or surface layer may comprise many known hydrophobic materials, surfaces and coatings. Hydrophobic coatings, surfaces and materials are known and may comprise, for example, a plasma treated surface and a mono-layer, a hydrophobic material such as silicone. [0754] Fig. 29E2 shows a covering 2954 with a hydrophobic upper layer 2960 and a hydrophilic lower layer with the lower hydrophilic layer 2962 thicker than the upper hydrophobic layer. The hydrophobic layer and the hydrophilic layer each comprise a \n\n thickness. The hydrophilic layer thickness can be at least about twice the thickness of the hydrophobic layer. For example the hydrophilic layer can be at least about ten times as thick as the hydrophobic layer. The hydrophobic layer may comprise a monolayer, for example a monolayer no more than about 40 nm thick. The thicker hydrophilic layer may have some advantages. For example, the thicker hydrophilic layer comprises a water density that is hyperosmotic relative to the normal hydration of the cornea, such that the cornea can be dried with the hyperosmotic hydrophilic layer.\n\n\n[0755] Fig. 29E3 shows a covering 2954 with a hydrophobic upper layer 2960 and a hydrophilic lower layer 2962with the upper layer thicker than the hydrophobic layer. For example, the hydrophilic layer may comprise a thickness no more than about half a thickness of the hydrophobic layer. The thicker hydrophobic layer may be useful with embodiments where it is desirable to decrease changes in thickness of the covering due to hydration of the underlying cornea. Also, the increased thickness of the hydrophobic layer can decrease permeability to water and increase oxygen permeability, for example when the hydrophobic layer comprises silicone.\n\n\n[0756] Fig. 29E4 shows a covering 2954 with a hydrophobic upper 2964 monolayer opposite a hydrophilic lower monolayer 2966. The covering with at least one monolayer may comprise two monolayers, and the hydrophobic layer and the hydrophilic layer may each comprise one of the two monolayers. The two monolayers can be tied together with a crosslinker such that the two monolayers are positioned opposite each other. The covering comprising the two monolayers can be very thin, for example about 100 nm. A very thin monolayer can conform to the cornea, for example to the epithelium, and may conform to the cornea with a substantially uniform thickness so that the patient can benefit from optical correction ablated into a stromal surface.\n\n\n[0757] Fig. 29E5 shows a covering 2954 comprising a hydrophilic upper layer 2968, hydrophobic inner layer 2970 and a hydrophilic lower layer 2972. The covering comprises the second hydrophilic layer. The second hydrophilic layer may comprise an upper surface and the first hydrophilic layer may comprise a lower surface. The hydrophobic layer is disposed between the first hydrophilic layer and the second hydrophilic layer. A covering with an upper surface comprising a hydrophilic layer can help the tear film spread uniformly over the upper surface which can improve patient vision and decrease friction with at least one of a contact lens or the eyelid that contacts the upper surface and may move relative to \n\n the upper surface, for example when the patient blinks. The hydrophobic layer, for example silicone, may inhibit the flow of water through the covering. The lower hydrophilic surface may help the lower surface stick to exposed stroma, and may facilitate removal of the covering when the epithelium is regenerated. [0758] Fig. 29F l and 29F2 show a covering 2974 with inner channels 2976 to pass tear liquid from an outer opening to an inner portion. The covering may comprise an inner portion, for example a central portion 2974CP, configured for placement over an epithelial defect. The covering may also comprise an outer portion, for example a peripheral portion 2974PP, configured for placement on the epithelium away from the defect. The covering may comprise at least one channel 2976 extending along the outer portion to pass fluid. The at least one channel can extend from a peripheral opening 2976PO located near an outer boundary of the peripheral portion to an inner opening 2976IO located within a central potion of the covering. The at least one channel may comprise a tube, for example a capillary, extending from an outer boundary of the outer portion to the inner portion. The capillary can draw fluid, for example a liquid such as water, through the peripheral portion to the central portion. The capillaries can be sized such that the water passed through the capillaries is no more than water passed through the epithelium such that the cornea is deturgesced with endothelial pumping. The fluid may also comprise a gas, for example when the covering is removed. Vacuum pressure of the central portion may be reduced during covering removal when gas travels through the channel to the central portion, so as to reduce vacuum pressure under the central portion of the covering.\n\n\n[0759] Fig. 29F3 shows a covering with lower surface 2974LS channels 2976 to pass tear liquid from an outer opening 2976PO to an inner portion 297610.\n\n\n[0760] Fig. 29G shows a covering 2978 comprising an inner portion 2978CP and a peripheral portion 2978PP, in which holes 2980, also referred to as apertures, extend from an upper surface to a lower surface to pass liquid to remove the covering. The holes comprise an example of at least one channel comprising a plurality of apertures extending through a thickness of the outer portion.\n\n\n[0761] Fig. 29H shows a covering 2982 with a rough lower surface 2984 and a smooth upper surface 2986. The covering and corneal tissue may be roughened in many ways. For example, the lower surface can be microshaped using a femtosecond laser or an excimer laser. Work in relation to embodiments of the present invention indicates that microshaping \n\n of the covering and/or recipient Bowman's 14 and/or stroma 16 can provide adhesion. The lower surface can be roughened with mechanical roughening such as scraping. The ablated corneal surface 1 1 of the recipient cornea may also be ablated and/or treated with a femtosecond laser or additional ablation so as to microfinish the surface with roughness. Microfinishing may provide increased surface area so as to adhere the covering to the stroma and/or Bowman's with Van der Waals forces.\n\n\n[0762] In many embodiments, the ablated surface comprises a roughness and the lower surface of the covering comprises a similar roughness. As both surfaces comprise comparable roughness, for example roughness on the order of about a micron, contact between the two surfaces can cause friction that can minimize sliding of the covering over the ablated surface when the covering is held against the ablated surface, for example with at least one of a contact lens or suction.\n\n\n[0763] The lower surface can be configured for friction with the ablated stroma in many ways. For example the lower surface can be roughened, may comprise nano structures, and may comprise interlocking structures. The lower surface may comprise structures configured to interlock with collage for adhesion, for example small protrusions, such as hairs, hooks, or pokers that extend downward to go around collagen fibers. The protrusions may comprise a density per square mm, and the density per square mm can be configured for the desired amount of adhesion and removal. A first force, or first pressure, may be used to apply the covering to the ablated stroma, and a second force, or second pressure, required for removal. The second force can be configured such that the covering is lifted by the epithelium when the epithelium regenerates.\n\n\n[0764] The covering comprising the rough lower surface can be adhered to the lower surface, for example with fibrin. The covering may also be configured to crosslink to the stroma, for example with riboflavin. Many of the above adhesives can stick to the stroma and slough off the epithelium when the epithelium regenerates. With both cross-linking and adhesives, the epithelium can grow under the covering so as to dislodge the covering when the epithelium grows centripetally during regeneration.\n\n\n[0765] The covering can be removed with a solution that dissolves an adhesive. For example, the covering can be adhered with fibrin and a drop of a fibrin dissolving substance applied when the epithelium has regenerated. For example the fibrin dissolving substance may comprise known tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) or a known plasmin. \n\n [0766] The covering may comprise a layer to inhibit water penetration, for example as described above, such that the endothelium can maintain corneal deturgescence when the covering is positioned on the eye, as described above.\n\n\n|0767] The covering may comprise an upper surface comprising an upper surface portion, for example a central upper surface portion. The covering may comprise a lower surface comprising a lower surface portion disposed opposite the upper surface portion.\n\n\n[0768] The upper surface portion may be smoother than the lower surface portion. The lower surface portion may comprise a first amount of roughness for friction against the ablated stromal surface. This roughness of the lower surface can provide friction so as to resist sliding of the lower the lower surface portion along the stromal surface, for example when the patient blinks. The upper surface portion may comprise a second amount of roughness. The second amount of roughness can be less than the first amount of roughness, so as to slide the upper surface portion along at least one of a contact lens or an eyelid, for example when the patient blinks. This differential roughness of the upper and lower surfaces can retain the covering against the ablated stroma and minimize sliding of the covering against the ablated stroma, so as to decrease patient and irritation.\n\n\n[0769] The lower surface portion may be configured in many ways to comprise the first amount of roughness and the upper surface portion may be configured in many ways to comprise the second amount of roughness. For example, the first amount of roughness may be at least about twice the second amount of roughness. The upper surface portion comprises an optically smooth surface. For example, the optically smooth surface of the upper surface portion may comprise an RMS roughness for visual acuity of about 20/25 or better. The lower surface portion may comprise an optically rough surface. For example, the optically rough surface may comprise an RMS roughness for a visually acuity less than about 20/25 or better before the covering is placed against the cornea, and a visual acuity of at least about 20/25 or better when the covering is placed on the cornea. The lower surface portion may comprise a material having an index of refraction within a range from about 1.36 to about 1.40, such that the visual quality of the covering is improved when the covering is positioned against the ablated corneal surface.\n\n\n[0770] Fig. 29H I shows a covering 2982 with interlocking structures 2988. The interlocking structures may comprise barbs, hooks, and/or protrusions extending from a base on the covering to an enlarged distal end. \n\n [0771] Fig. 29H2 shows a covering 2982 with nanostructures 2990A. The nanostriictures may comprise many structures, for protrusions and indentations such as castellation. In some embodiments, the nanostructures may comprise setae and/or fibers with spatulas on the end, so as to increase surface area and provide charge on the nanostructure of the covering and/or cornea, for example with Van der Waals forces. Nanostructures with adhesive properties suitable for incorporation in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,229,685. Such nanostructures can be provided on the covering and/or the cornea to adhere the covering to the cornea. The nanostructures can be disposed on a peripheral portion of the covering disposed away from a central vision correcting portion of the covering.\n\n\n[0772] Fig. 29H3 shows an amniotic membrane 2990A2 tissue layer suitable for incorporation with the therapeutic coverings 2982 as described above. The amniotic membrane comprises an epithelium 2990A4, a basement membrane 2990A6, a compact layer 2990A8, and a fibroblast-containing collagenous layer 2990A 10. The amniotic membrane may comprise at least one hydrophilic collagenous layer suitable for combination with a hydrophobic layer, as described herein. For example, the amniotic membrane may comprise the hydrophilic material of the coverings of Figs. 29A l to 29H.\n\n\n[0773] The hydrophobic layer of the covering may be combined in many ways with the hydrophilic layer comprising amniotic membrane material. The hydrophilic layer comprising amniotic membrane material may comprise at least one of a layer of amniotic membrane tissue, particles of amniotic membrane attached to the hydrophobic layer, a film of amniotic membrane material coated onto a hydrophobic layer, a blend of amniotic membrane material and a known contact lens material, a hydrophilic material treated with an amniotic solution so as to trap tissue repair and growth factors in the hydrophilic material. The hydrophobic layer may comprise a contact lens with at least one hydrophobic layer, for example a silicone contact lens. The hydrophilic layer may comprise the amniotic membrane tissue layer, and the hydrophobic layer may contact the epithelium of the amniotic membrane. Alternatively, the hydrophobic layer may contact the collagenous fibroblast-containing layer of the amniotic tissue layer. The hydrophobic layer may be formed on either the epithelium layer or the fibroblast-containing layer, for example by applying NuSiI RTV Silicone to one of the layers and scraping with a squeegee to form the hydrophobic layer on the hydrophilic layer in contact with the hydrophilic amniotic membrane layer. The hydrophilic layer comprising amniotic membrane may be applied to a layer of hydrophobic material, for example similar to \n\n the application of amniotic membrane, amniotic particles, amniotic solution to form an amniotic film, and amniotic solution to entrap tissue repair and growth factors in a contact lens as described in Examples I to 6 of U.S. Pat Nos. 5,932,205 and 6, 143,315, the disclosures of which may be suitable for combination in accordance in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. The hydrophilic layer may comprise optically clear collagen material, for example as described in US Pub. 20030187515 and US Pub. 20040048796, the disclosure of which may be suitable for combination in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.\n\n\n[0774] Fig. 291 shows a covering 2990A 10 with charge to retain the covering on the cornea. Charge on the covering 2990A 12 and cornea can adhere the cornea to the covering. Work in relation to embodiments of the present invention suggests that disruption of collagen fibers can provide charge to promote adhesion. The stroma 16 and/or Bowman's 14 can be ablated with the excimer laser, for example with PRK, and the covering may comprise disrupted fibers, for example collagen fibers disrupted with at least one of an excimer laser or femtosecond laser. Chemical treatment and/or scintillation may also be employed to promote adhesion of the covering and cornea with charge. In some embodiments, the charge may comprise intermolecular forces, for example Van der Waals forces at the interface between the covering and the Bowman's membrane and/or stroma.\n\n\n[0775] Fig. 29J l shows a covering 2990A 14 comprising a plurality of zones configured to release a drug for each of one, two and three days, according to embodiments of the present invention. The covering may comprise an outer portion 2990A 14PP without the drug 2990A 16, and an inner portion configured to release the drug. The inner portion configured to release the drug may comprise a first inner portion configured to release the drug for a first time 2990A 18, for example one day, and a second inner portion configured to release the drug for a second time 2990A20, for example two days. The first inner portion may comprises a first length across, for example about five mm, and the second inner portion may comprise a second length across, for example about 3 mm. The first time can be less than the second time such that more drug is released from the second inner portion, for example the two day portion, as the epithelium advances centripetally to cover the epithelial defect. Additional drug release portions can be used for example a portion configured to release drug for three days. This configuration may allow for drugs to be released directly toward the stroma from a lower surface of the covering. Alternatively, the covering may comprise a \n\n hydrophobic lower surface with an inner zone that may extend along the debrided zone and then slowly release drugs towards the stroma.\n\n\n[0776] The drug may comprise many of the drugs described above, for example at least one of steroids, anti-inflammatories, antibiotics or analgesics. For example the drug may comprise the analgesic, and the analgesic may comprise at least one of gabapentin, proparacaine, lidocaine, or tetracaine or a derivative thereof. The covering may also release metabolites, for example, glucose, to aid in the healing process of the epithelium.\n\n\n[0777] Fig. 29J2 shows the covering 2990A 14 of Fig 29J 1 on a cornea two days after ablation. The epithelium 14 has advanced centripetally to partially cover the ablation zone 1 1. The epithelium has advanced toward the two day portion of the covering 2990A20. Experiments of re-epithelialization rates and sizes at times following surgery can be conducted on an empirical number of patients to determine the size and times of the inner portions. The size and time can be configured such that a majority of the drug is released from each portion before the epithelium advances centripetally to each portion so as to inhibit or minimize contact of the drug releasing portion with the epithelium. Mathematical modeling and simulations can be conducted to determine the effectiveness and optimize the configuration of the drug releasing portions.\n\n\n[0778] Fig. 29K l shows a covering 2990A26 configured for a tight fit with a cornea. The tight fit may decrease swelling of the cornea. The covering comprises a lower surface with covering radius 2990A26CR. For a tight fit, the covering radius is substantially the same as the radius of the cornea 2990A28, for example to within about 0.05 mm of a peripheral portion of the cornea. The tight fit may comprise a steep fit, with the radius of the contact lens less than the radius of the cornea such that the lower surface of the covering is steeper than the peripheral surface of the cornea near the periphery of the cornea. The covering radius of the outer portion may comprise many sizes and can be sized to stretch the outer portion of the covering when the outer portion of the covering is placed against a peripheral portion of cornea away from the epithelial defect. For example the covering radius of curvature can be no more than, or even less than, a radius of curvature of cornea 1 I CR. A covering radius of curvature can cause the covering to engage the cornea with an outer peripheral portion of the covering. The outer portion of the covering may comprise an elastic material such that the outer portion is adapted to stretch and form a seal with an unablated portion of the cornea when the outer portion contacts the unablated portion of the cornea. \n\n [0779| Fig. 29K2 shows the covering 2990A26 of Fig. 29K 1 placed on the cornea with the tight fit such that the covering conforms to the ablated stroma 1 1. The covering may also conform to the inner edge of the epithelium 12. The peripheral outer portion of the covering may stretch more than the central portion of the covering such that the peripheral portion may exert a greater force on the cornea to seal the cornea.\n\n\n[0780] The tight fit lens may be enhanced by heating the cornea and lens, for example by about 1 to 2 degrees Centigrade. The diameter of the covering may be less than 13 mm or more than 15 mm to enhance the tight fit. The covering may be thicker in the outer periphery and thinner inward near the center to enhance the tight fit, and may comprise an outer rim. [0781] Fig. 29L shows a covering 2990A30 with a light transmitting 2990A32 central portion 2990A34 and a non-light transmitting 2990A36 peripheral portion 2990A38. The inner portion may comprise many of the optically transparent materials as described above and a smooth optical surface for patient vision. The peripheral outer portion may comprise an optically non-transmissive material, for example at least one of an absorbing material or a scattering material. For example, a patient may be fitted with covering where the diameter of the light transmitting central portions are of different diameters, for example 1 -3 mm for the smaller diameter and 3-5 mm for the larger one. The covering with the larger diameter light transmitting portion would allow such a patient to see under low light conditions, while the covering with the smaller diameter light transmitting portion would allow such patient to see with a smaller pupil so as to increase a depth of field of images and may also decrease optical effects due to the epithelium as the epithelium advances centripetally.\n\n\n[0782] Fig. 29M 1 A and 29M 1 C show a covering 2990A40 comprising outer structures, for example peripheral structures to inhibit or minimize motion of the covering on the cornea and a bandage lens 2990A42 positioned over the covering. The covering can be adapted to conform to the cornea, as described above, and may comprise a smooth upper optical surface and a lower surface with roughening to inhibit or minimize motion, as described above. The covering comprises at least two, for example four, radially extending protrusions configured to inhibit or minimize at least one of rotation or lateral motion of the covering over the cornea. The outer structures may comprise at least one of apertures or protrusions 2990A44. The outer structures can be configured to extend along an inner surface of a bandage covering, for example a bandage lens, such that the bandage lens can exert force on the covering near the outer structure. The outer structure may form an interstitial space that can \n\n be filled by the cornea, and the outer structure may indent the cornea slightly so as to form an interlocking fit with the outer structure. The covering may comprise a covering material harder than corneal tissue, for example at least one of Bowman's membrane, the epithelium or the stroma, so as to deform the cornea or form an interstitial space between the cornea and the lens.\n\n\n[0783] Fig. 29M 1 B shows a cross sectional view of the covering 2990A40 and bandage lens 2990A42 of Fig. 29M l A placed on a cornea. The covering conforms to the cornea under the bandage contact lens, also referred to as a shield. The covering comprises features to inhibit or minimize, for example twisting, of the lens axially and lateral forces, for example from an eyelid during blinking. Experimental studies have indicated that the cornea can conform, for example indent, in response to a covering placed under a contact lens. For example, the epithelium can smooth the interface between the covering and the ablated surface. The cornea can fill in around the covering, for example into the interstitial space between the covering and contact lens, and the covering may slightly indent the cornea, so as to form an interlock with the cornea. The deformed and/or filling cornea in conjunction with the structure of the covering can form an interlocking structure, so as to inhibit or minimize at least one of rotation or lateral motion of the covering along the surface of the cornea. The force holding the covering or therapeutic lens to the cornea is greater than the force adhere the therapeutic lens to the bandage lens without the use of an adhesive, while allowing the epithelium to heal at the point of adherence between the therapeutic lens and the debrided zone. Alternative embodiments of a non-moving lens include a piano, vaulting, silicone scleral lens, silicone lenses and RGP lenses.\n\n\n[0784J Fig. 29M l D shows a covering 2990A40, similar to the covering of Fig. 29M l A, comprising aperture 2990A46 structures to inhibit or minimize motion of the covering on the cornea. The aperture structures can be positioned away from the epithelial defect 1 1 when the covering is placed on the cornea following PRK, for example outside an epithelial debrided zone. The covering may also be sized to fit within the epithelial debridement, for example as described above. The aperture structures may comprise many shapes of apertures, for example elongate apertures, arcuate apertures, oval apertures, rectangular apertures or square apertures.\n\n\n10785] Fig. 29M 1 E shows a covering 2990A40, similar to the covering of Fig. 29M 1 A, comprising protruding aperture structures 2990A48 to inhibit or minimize motion of the \n\n covering on the cornea, in which the aperture structures 2990A50 can be positioned away from the epithelial defect when the covering is placed on the cornea following PRK;\n\n\n[0786] Fig. 29M 1 F shows a plan view of the covering 2990A40 of Figs. 29M 1 A to 29M l C. [0787] Fig. 29M l G shows a covering, similar to the covering of Fig. 29M l A, comprising circular aperture structures to inhibit or minimize motion of the covering on the cornea, in which the aperture structures can be positioned away from the epithelial defect when the covering is placed on the cornea following PRK;\n\n\n[0788] Fig. 29M 1 H shows covering 2990A40, similar to the covering of Fig. 29M 1 A, comprising protruding radially elongate structures 2990A56 to inhibit or minimize motion of the covering on the cornea, in which the protruding radially elongate structures can be positioned away from the epithelial defect when the covering is placed on the cornea following PRK.\n\n\n[0789] Fig. 29N shows a therapeutic covering 2990 comprising an outer portion 2992 configured to conform to the cornea so as to seal the covering over the cornea and an non- conforming inner portion 2994 configured to retain an optical shape and smooth the cornea for vision. The inner portion 2994 comprises an upper surface 2994U and a lower surface 2994L. The outer portion 2992 comprises an upper surface 2992U and a lower surface 2992L. The covering may comprise an upper hydrophilic layer along each of the upper surfaces, a middle hydrophobic layer along each of the inner and outer portions, and a lower hydrophilic layer along each of the inner and outer portions. The hydrophobic and hydrophobic layers can be similar to those described above. While many hydrophilic coatings can be used, the lubricous coating may comprise commercially available N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP), polyamine based coatings, methacrylate based coatings, and lubricous coatings commercially available from Surmodics Inc., Tri-Star Plastics Inc. and AST\n\n\nProducts Inc.. The hydrophilic coating may comprise phosphorylcholine technology, for example a coating commercially available from Vertellus.\n\n\n[0790] The covering comprises a thickness sufficient to inhibit water through the covering and sufficient to maize swelling related to hypoxia of the cornea, for example within a range from about 20 to about 200 microns. For example, the covering may comprise an oxygen permeability, also referred to as Dk, of at least about 350, for example 400 or even 500 or more. For example, the covering may comprise a hydrophobic NuSiI inner layer configured \n\n to transport oxygen and inhibit passage of water, and upper and lower hydrophilic layers, respectively, as described above. The silicone layer may comprise, for example, dimethyl diphenyl methyl vinyl silicone. The hardness of the covering, the thicknesses and oxygen can be configured by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide the sealing, water barrier, oxygen and optical functions to reduce edema based on the teachings described herein.\n\n\n[0791] The thin lens covering comprises four characteristics that provide: a barrier against tear liquid entering the debrided zone, high oxygen permeability, and a good optical zone in the center of the lens, and an environment that encourages healthy epithelial re-growth. For example, silicone may have a very high oxygen permeability. The thin lens covering layer may comprise hydrophobic silicone may be covered with a hydrophilic lower layer to encourage healthy epithelial re-growth. The silicone layer may be coated on the lid side with a hydrophilic lubricant that that provides good tear film optics by smoothing the tear film, and which exhibits superior oxygen permeability.\n\n\n[0792] The inner portion 2994 can be configured in many ways to provide the optical surface, water barrier, and high oxygen transport. The central portion can be configured to retain the optical surface, even when the epithelium underneath is somewhat irregular in many ways. For example, the inner portion may comprise a thickness from about 50 to about 200 microns. The inner portion may comprise a hardness durometer parameter within a range from about Shore A 30 to about Shore A 70, such that the inner portion retains the optical surface.\n\n\n[0793] The outer portion 2992 can be configured in many ways to seal the covering against the epithelium and provide barrier function. For example, the outer portion may comprise a thickness from about 20 to about 100 microns, and may comprise a Shore A hardness durometer parameter within a range from about 20 to about 60.\n\n\n[0794] The covering 2990 can be configured in many ways so as to seal the cornea. The outer portion and inner portion comprise a radius of curvature 2990R. The radius of curvature 2990R can be the same for both the inner portion and the outer portion. For example, the radius of each the inner portion and the outer portion may comprise about 7.5 mm. Alternatively, the inner portion may comprise a radius of curvature fit to the ablation profile, and the outer portion may comprise a radius of curvature fit to the unablated peripheral epithelium corresponding to the pre-ablation radius of curvature, as described above. \n\n [0795J Fig. 29N- 1 shows the therapeutic covering as in Fig. 29N adhered to a cornea after PRK with endothelial suction. The inner portion 2994 is positioned over the ablation 20. The inner portion can be sized smaller than the ablation such that the outer portion 2992 extends at least partially over the ablation and the edge of the epithelium. The outer portion 2992 extends over the boundary of the ablation 2OB and the edge of epithelium 12 so as to conform to the epithelium and the edge of the ablation such that the lens is sealed on the cornea.\n\n\n[0796] Fig. 29N-2 shows the outer portion therapeutic covering as in Figs. 29N and 29N- 1 conforming to the cornea over the undebrided epithelium and over the edge of the ablation 2OB. The outer portion can comprise a size and a thickness so as to conform with the epithelium at the edge of the epithelial defect 12E and at the edge of the ablation 2OB. For example, the thickness may comprise about 20 um at the periphery of the outer portion and extend to the central portion with an increasing thickness to about 50 microns. The outer portion may comprise a Shore A durometer hardness parameter of about 20 to about 40. The thickness can be increased as the durometer is decreased. For example, the thickness may extend from about 20 um at the periphery to about 100 microns near the inner portion. As the endothelial suction may not take effect immediately, contact lens may be positioned over the covering 2990 to retain the covering such that the covering can be pulled down ward against the epithelium with endothelial suction so as to seal the covering. The covering 2990 may be retained with many structures, adhesives and photosensitizers as described above.\n\n\n[0797] Fig. 29N-3 shows the inner portion of the therapeutic covering as in Figs. 29N and 29N- 1 with an optical surface disposed over regenerating corneal epithelium. The optical surface may comprise upper surface 2994U of inner portion 2994L. Work in relation to embodiments suggests that the epithelium can be somewhat irregular during regeneration, and that this irregularity can contribute to decreased vision. Inner portion 2994 comprises sufficient rigidity such that the inner portion retains the optical shape of the surfaces. For example, when irregular epithelium regenerated under the inner portion, the inner portion may separate slightly from the ablated surface such that the inner portion floats on the regenerating epithelium. As the regenerated epithelium may be subject to suction of the endothelium due so sealing and endothelial pumping, the irregular epithelium can be smoothed by the lower optical surface of the inner portion so as to improve patient vision, for example to about 20/30 or better when the epithelium has regenerated at three days post-op. As the epithelium may continue to smooth after re-epithelialization, the covering may be \n\n positioned on the cornea for more than three days, for example 7 days or more and even one month.\n\n\n[0798] The upper and lower surfaces of the inner portion can be curved in many ways to provide functional patient vision of at least 20/40 (metric 6/12) or better, for example 20/30 (metric 6/9) or better. For example the inner portion may comprise an optical power within a range from about -1 D to about +1 D. The lower surface 2994U may comprise a radius of curvature so as to correspond to the ablation 20, as described above.\n\n\n[0799] Fig. 290 shows a therapeutic covering as in Fig. 29N comprising a covering molded with a homogeneous material, in which the outer portion comprises a thickness configured to conform with the cornea and in which the inner portion comprises thickness configured to retain the optical shape. The outer portion 2992 may comprise a thickness of no more than about 100 microns. For example the outer portion may comprise a thickness of about 50 microns at the boundary with the inner portion, and linearly taper from 50 microns at the boundary with the inner portion to about 20 microns at the periphery of the outer portion. The inner portion may comprise a thickness of no more than about 200 microns. For example, the inner portion may comprise a thickness of about 100 microns. Many materials can be used as described above. For example, the single piece covering may comprise silicone having a water content within a range from about 0.1 % to about 10%, for example no more than about 1 %, and a hardness Shore A durometer parameter within a range from about 20 to about 70, for example about 30.\n\n\n[0800] Fig. 29P shows a therapeutic covering as in Fig. 29N comprising a covering molded with a first outer material and a second inner material, in which the outer portion 2992 comprises a first hardness configured to conform with the cornea and in which the inner portion 2994 comprises second hardness configured to retain the optical shape. The outer material may comprise many materials as described above. For example, the outer material may comprise silicone having a hardness Shore A durometer parameter from about 20 to about 40, and the inner material may comprise silicone having a hardness durometer parameter from about 40 to about 70.\n\n\n[0801] Fig. 29Q shows a therapeutic covering as in Fig. 29N comprising a first outer portion composed of a first material affixed to a second inner portion composed of a second material, in which the outer portion comprises a first hardness configured to conform with the cornea and in which the inner portion comprises second hardness configured to retain the optical \n\n shape. The central inner portion may comprise a rigid central portion, of a higher durometer, of 3-4 mm in diameter to improve visual acuity in patients. This optically clear central portion may be up to 6mm in diameter, for example. The central inner portion may provide optical power when placed on the eye, although patients receiving refractive vision correction such as PRK may not benefit from such refractive power such that the inner lens portion may comprise no more than about +/- 1 Diopter of optical power. The center portion may comprise many materials, for example an RGP material. The peripheral outer portion may comprise a less rigid material, of a lower durometer, than the central portion so as to conform to the cornea along the epithelium and around the debrided edge and the edge of the ablation. Since optical clarity may not play a substantial role in the peripheral portion, the peripheral portion may comprise a transparent or opaque material. For example the peripheral portion may comprise an opaque material so as to define an aperture of the inner portion, for example a pinhole as described above. [0802] Fig. 29R shows a covering comprising an annular configuration with the inner portion 2994 comprising an optic zone with a lower surface composed of a hydrophobic material configured for placement over the epithelial defect and the outer portion 2992 comprising a lower surface having a hydrophilic material configured to contact the epithelium. The diameter of the hydrophilic layer may have greater than the diameter of the hydrophobic layer so as to allow the hydrophilic layer to contact the epithelium when the inner hydrophobic layer is sucked down over the debrided area of the cornea.\n\n\n[0803] Work in relation to embodiments suggests that silicone can store oxygen, and that silicone can diffuse from the hydrophobic layer to the cornea. Therefore, the therapeutic covering positioned on the eye may comprise oxygen that can diffuse to the cornea. [0804] The thin therapeutic lens coverings as described above, may comprise the thin flap lens placed on the eye in a dry configuration to facilitate handing.\n\n\n[0805] Figs. 3OA to 3OC show a method of forming an annular band with protrusions to attach a contact lens to the cornea.\n\n\n[0806] Fig. 30A shows an isometric cutaway view showing the lay up of thin walled positive form 3000 (.032\" metal walled cup) with hole 3002 permitting .005\" wire 3004 to exit the region of flowing plastic 3006, which is in between the solid base 3008 and the cup.\n\n\n[0807] Fig. 30B shows a cross sectional view showing the layup prior to the application of heat (200\n0\nC) with .005\" wire pressed against polycarbonate strip. \n\n |0808] Fig. 3OC shows a cross sectional view showing the layup after the application of heat, with the .005\" wire 3004 now embedded into the polycarbonate strip 3006 which has flowed to fill the gap supported by the thickness of the wire.\n\n\n[0809] Fig. 30D shows a method 30D00 of treating a PRK patient with a therapeutic covering. A step 30D05 measures the patient correction, for example a vision correction. A step 30D 10 determines an ablation profile in response to the vision correction. A step 3OD 15 places a speculum in the eye of the patient, for example a physician placing the speculum in the eye of the patient to keep the eyelids separated and the cornea exposed. A step 30D20 removes the epithelium, for example with known methods as described above. A step 30D25 ablates the eye to correct vision, for example with known ablation profiles as described above. A step 30D30 places a therapeutic covering on the eye. The therapeutic covering may be placed on the eye after ablation and before the eye is hydrated when the speculum is placed against the eyelids. When the speculum is placed against the eyelids, the eyelids cannot blink to hydrate the eye and the cornea may dry. The covering may comprise an amount of hydration that is dryer than normally hydrated corneal tissue that comprises about 85% water, so as to adhere the covering to the stromal tissue. For example, the covering may comprise hyperosmotic hydration relative to the normally hydrated cornea, so as to adhere the covering to the cornea. A step 30D35 conforms the covering to the ablated corneal surface. The covering can be conformed to the corneal surface when positioned on the corneal surface, for example with pressure to the covering. A step 30D40 places a contact lens over the eye, for example a contact lens as described above. The covering may form a seal with the corneal epithelium when the covering conforms to the cornea. A step 30D45 adheres the contact lens to the cornea, for example as described above. A step 30D50 hydrates the eye, for example with saline from an artificial source. A step 30D55 removes the speculum from the eye, such that the patient can blink. A step 30D60 deturgesces the cornea, for example with endothelial pumping. A step 30D65 adheres the covering to the cornea with endothelial suction. A step 30D70 decreases pain, decreases swelling and improves vision, for example in response to deturgescence of the cornea . A step 30D75 regenerates the epithelium, for example such that the epithelium grows over the ablated corneal stroma and/or Bowman's membrane. A step 30D80 hydrates the contact lens, for example in preparation for removal of the contact lens. A step 30D85 removes the contact lens. A step 30D90 hydrates the therapeutic covering, for example in preparation for removal of the therapeutic covering. Another step can be to apply an oil, such as silicone oil to the eye, for example when the \n\n covering comprises silicone. A step 30D95 removes the covering so as to separate the covering from the underlying regenerated epithelium, such that the underlying regenerated epithelium remains intact over the ablated stroma and/or epithelium.\n\n\n[0810] It should be appreciated that the specific steps illustrated in Figure 3OD provide a particular method of treating a PRK patient with a therapeutic covering, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Other sequences of steps may also be performed according to alternative embodiments. For example, alternative embodiments of the present invention may perform the steps outlined above in a different order. Moreover, the individual steps illustrated in Figure 3OD may include multiple sub-steps that may be performed in various sequences as appropriate to the individual step. Furthermore, additional steps may be added or removed depending on the particular applications.

If stromal edema can be reduced during the first post-operative days, vision can be preserved. To establish what is the role of edema in vision recovery following PRK it can be important to establish whether dehydrating \n\n the cornea of the post-operative edema can significantly improve vision in patients following PRK. Dehydration of edematous corneas using Glycerin solution, a hyperosmotic agent, can be performed in the ophthalmologist's office to reduce edema when such edema obscures objects seen through the cornea. Glycerin can have a short lasting effect (minutes) and may temporarily dehydrate the edematous cornea. The purpose of this study is to examine if reduction of corneal edema using glycerin can improve patient's vision following PRK. [0818] Study objective:\n\n\n[0819] Determine if reducing stromal edema can improve vision is patients during the initial post operative days following PRK.

Its main draw backs are severe pain associated with it during the first postoperative days and delayed visual recovery. Standard means for mitigating pain are use of local non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, systemic pain killers and bandage therapeutic lens. While these \n\n measures are somewhat helpful, the many patients still complain of severe pain which causes them a significant burden (to the extent of causing sleepless nights, inability to open their eye lids, inability to work and more).\n\n\n[0833J The main cause for pain may be that following epithelial debridement in preparation for PRK nerve endings are exposed and during the initial post operative days until the epithelium heals rubbing of eye lids against the wound causes severe pain. While standard bandage therapeutic lens may reduce pain to some extent, it still freely moves on the eye thus rubbing exposed nerve endings.\n\n\n[0834] Gluing the therapeutic lens may prevent such rubbing and may potentially significantly reduce such pain. Fibrin glue (TissealTM, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Glendale, CA)can be used to glue the therapeutic lens to the cornea. The purpose of this study is to examine if gluing a therapeutic lens to the cornea using fibrin glue can reduce pain in such patients.\n\n\n[0835] Study objective: [0836] Determine if a therapeutic lens bonded on the cornea following PRK can reduce pain associated with the epithelial defect during the initial period following PRK.\n\n\n[0837] Study population:\n\n\n[0838] At least 10 patients who underwent PRK.\n\n\n[0839] Study duration: [0840] One day\n\n\n[0841] Study design:\n\n\n[0842] A prospective non-randomized comparative case-control study\n\n\n[0843] Inclusion criteria:\n\n\n1 Patients who underwent bilateral PRK for myopic correction. 2 Age 18-60.\n\n\n3 Evidence of an epithelial defect.\n\n\n4 Patient complains of significant pain.\n\n\n5 Willing to sign an informed consent. [0844] Exclusion criteria 1 Any other anterior segment abnormality other than that associated with PRK.\n\n\n2 Any abnormalities associated with the eye lids. [0845] Example Methods \n\n 1 Patients following PRK will be examined 1 day following PRK at the outpatient clinic.\n\n\n2 Aside from the procedure described below no alteration in patient management in the post PRK period will be made. 3 One eye will be randomly selected to be the study eye while the other will serve as control.\n\n\n4 Following detailed explanation and signing an informed consent form each patient will perform the following: a.

[0847] Title: Corneal Coating for Mitigating Pain Following Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK) [0848] Background:\n\n\n[0849] PRK is a well established procedure for refractive correction for close to 20 years. Its main draw backs can be severe pain associated with it during the first postoperative days and delayed visual recovery. Means for mitigating pain are use of local non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents, systemic pain killers and bandage therapeutic lens. While these measures are somewhat helpful, many patients still complain of severe pain which causes them a significant burden (to the extent of causing sleepless nights, inability to open their eye lids, inability to work and more). [0850] The main cause for pain may be that following epithelial debridement in preparation for PRK nerve endings are exposed and during the initial post operative days until the epithelium heals rubbing of eye lids against the wound causes severe pain. While standard bandage contact may reduce pain to some extent, it still freely moves on the eye thus rubbing exposed nerve endings. A biocompatible material that can adhere to the cornea and not move during blinking and eye movement has the potential to significantly reduce pain after PRK. [0851] Fibrin glue (TissealTM, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Glendale, CA) can be used to coat the exposed surface of the cornea. The purpose of this study is to examine if coating the wounded area using fibrin glue can reduce pain in such patients.\n\n\n[0852] Study objective:\n\n\n[0853] Determine if a thin layer of fibrin glue placed on the cornea following PRK can reduce pain associated with the epithelial defect during the initial period following PRK. [0854] Study population: [0855] At least 10 patients who underwent PRK.

[0863] Example Outcome measures: 1 Relative change in pain before and after placing fibrin glue between study eye and non-study eye.\n\n\n2 Relative change in discomfort before and after placing fibrin glue between study eye and non-study eye.\n\n\n3 Difference in study eye between pre-procedure and post-procedure pain (l hr, 2hr and 4hr only).\n\n\n[0864] Animal studies may be also conducted in accordance with the embodiments described above.\n\n\n[0865] It should be appreciated that the protocols shown above provide a particular method of testing therapeutic coverings, according to some embodiments of the present invention. Other embodiments may also be tested in accordance with at least some aspects of the above testing protocols. Furthermore, additional embodiments may be tested in combination or removed depending on the particular applications. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives.\n\n\n[0866] Fig. 3 I A shows measured corneal edema immediately following PRK surgery and one day post-op with PRK patients. The corneal edema can be measure with pachymetry by comparing the pre-op values to the post-op values. The day of surgery, day 0, the edema is about 100 urn in the measure patients. At one day post-op, the swelling is about 140 um. This data shows the cornea swells following PRK both the day of surgery and the following day. [0867] Fig. 31 B shows a model for corneal swelling with PRK patients as in Fig. 3 I A.\n\n\nAfter PRK the epithelium has an epithelial defect 1 1 that allows water to enter the cornea 10 through the ablated stroma 16. This water passes through the cornea and is pumped from the \n\n cornea by the corneal endothelium 18. The amount of water that enters the cornea through the epithelial defect can exceed the pumping rate of the corneal endothelium, such that the cornea swell, for example in an anterior portion of the stroma 16 where the cornea is ablated.\n\n\n[08681 Fig- 32A shows measured corneal edema immediately following LASIK surgery and one day post-op with LASIK patients. The day of surgery, day 0, the corneal swelling is about 100 um, similar to the PRK patients. At one day post-op the corneal swelling is about 30 um. The 1 10 um difference in swelling between the PRK corneas and the LASIK corneas shows that PRK corneas swell more than LASIK corneas, at least for the first day post-op. As LASIK patients report less pain and have better vision at one day post-op than PRK patients, this data shows that swelling of the cornea can significantly effect patient comfort and may also effect patient vision.\n\n\n[0869] Fig. 32B shows a model for corneal swelling with LASIK patients as in Fig. 3 IA. With LASIK, a flap 3200 of corneal tissue is cut and moved to the side with a hinge that connects the flap to the cornea, and the exposed stromal tissue 16 ablated is ablated 1 1. The flap is repositioned on the cornea over the stromal ablation. As the flap retains the corneal epithelium, the flap may comprise a barrier to water entry of the corneal stroma. At surgery, the epithelium has not regenerated between the flap and the cornea, such that water can enter at the margin of the flap 3204. At one day post-op for LASIK, the epithelium can cover the margin of the flap to seal the cornea, such that the endothelium can effectively deturgesce the cornea so as to decrease swelling. Consequently, the cornea swells less with LASIK at one day post-op and patients report less pain and better vision.\n\n\n[0870] Figs. 33A and 33B show pre-op and post-op pachymetry measurements on patients with a Pentacamâ¢ to determine corneal edema at one day post-op. A Pentacamâ¢ is a known device for mapping the thickness of the cornea and is commercially available from Oculus, Inc. of Lynwood, WA. Fig. 33A shows the pre-op pachymetry map of a patient that is a - 1 .25 myope. The combined thickness of the pre-operative cornea comprising the endothelium, stroma, Bowman's membrane and epithelium is 524 um. The pre-operative thickness includes 60 um of corneal epithelium that is debrided. The thickness of the post operative cornea is 537 um. The edema of the cornea can be calculated from the change in pachymetry, the thickness of the epithelium and the thickness of the ablation. The preoperative cornea comprises a stromal thickness of about 464 microns, and is ablated with about 24 microns, such that the pachymetry should be about 440 um post-op. The measured \n\n corneal thickness is about 537 urn post-op, which is 97 microns more than the theoretical pachymetry post-op due to swelling of the stroma.\n\n\n[0871] Figs. 34A and 34B show pre-op and post-op pachymetry measurements on patients with a OCT to determine corneal edema at one day post-op. OCT, also referred to as optical coherence tomography, is a known and commercially available method of measuring corneal thickness. Fig. 34A shows the pre-operative corneal thickness as 458 microns, which includes 60 um of epithelium. The cornea was ablated with a targeted ablation depth of 24 microns. Fig. 34B shows the post-ablation stromal thickness to be 514 microns by OCT. Without swelling, the post-operative corneal thickness would have been 434 um (518 - 60 - 24) microns. The measured thickness of 514 microns indicates approximately 80 microns of corneal swelling.\n\n\n[0872] Fig. 35 shows loss of visual acuity and cornea edema with PRK for patients the day of surgery within about one hour of surgery, measured in accordance with the above protocols. For example, patient one OD (ocular dexter, or right eye), shows a pre-op corrected visual acuity of 20/25. One day post op the vision is 20/50 with a bandage lens (BL) and 20/50 with a rigid gas permeable lens (RGP). Therefore, post-op this patient has lost about 3 lines of visual acuity at one day post op. The edema based on OCT is about 70 um. The left eye, OS, of patient 1 shows similar results. Patients 2 and 3 show similar results.\n\n\n[0873] Fig. 36 shows loss of visual acuity and cornea edema with PRK patients one day after surgery, measure in accordance with the above protocols. These data show a loss of visual acuity and corneal swelling similar to Fig. 35. The edema of patient 1 OS is about 166 microns, and the edema of patient 2 OD is about 104. The last row shows the change in corneal edema from the day of surgery to the first day post-op (Baseline Pa@PRK day - Pa@l st day). The visual acuity of patient 2 with the right eye is 20/40 without a bandage lens (BL) and is correctable to 20/22 with a bandage lens, which indicates that post-operative swelling of the cornea can effect visual acuity.\n\n\n[0874] Also, the patients were treated with glycerin and HealonÂ® to determine the effect of corneal drying, in accordance with the above protocols. These data show that glycerin with a bandage contact lens can improve visual acuity (VA wo/BL GIy 1 ) with the first application at about 1 minute, which show visual acuity without a bandage lens improving by two lines in both the right and left eyes of patient 1 from about 20/50 and 20/66, respectively, to about \n\n 20/33 and 20/40. Subsequent applications of glycerin did not improve visual acuity (VA wo/BL + GIy 2). This may be due to penetration of the corneal stroma by the glycerin so as to decrease the hyperosmotic effect of the glycerin on the stroma. The subsequent treatment of the eyes with Healon, which has a higher molecular weight than glycerin, may not penetrate the stroma and may be effective to reduce swelling, for example as a filler material as described above. The initial testing with Healon (VA+RGB+Healon) did showed an improvement in vision over the second application in glycerin in both eyes of patient 1 , and not with the right eye of patient 3. Further experiments and refinements can be made on an empirical number of patients. [0875] Fig. 37 shows decrease in corneal edema and increase in visual acuity in response to glycerin applied to an initial sample of patient eyes so as to reduce swelling and improve visual acuity, in patients tested in accordance with the above protocols. Series 1 corresponds to visual acuity 20/xx and series 2 corresponds to cornea thickness.\n\n\n[0876] Fig. 38A-38D show clinical pictures of a flat covering on a human cornea with the covering conforming to the curved cornea of the patient and a contact lens placed over the covering.\n\n\n[0877] Fig. 38A shows a picture of a thin flap fibrin lens covering placed on the epithelium of a patient in accordance with the above protocols. In this particular experiment, the properties of the fibrin lens were evaluated on a cornea with an intact epithelium to demonstrate a flat lens adapted to conform the curvature of a cornea. The flat fibrin lenses were manufactured as described herein below with reference to the materials fabricated for testing of the US Air Force resolution target, described herein below. The edge of the lens 3800 is visible in Fig. 38A.\n\n\n[0878] Fig. 38B shows a picture of the lens covering of Fig. 38A on the patient with a bandage contact lens (BCL) placed over the thin fibrin flap covering after 15 minutes. A small air bubble 3802 is visible under the bandage contact lens at the edge of the fibrin covering.\n\n\n[0879] Fig. 38C shows a picture of the lens covering of Figs. 38A and 38B on the patient with a bandage contact lens (BCL) placed over the thin fibrin flap covering after 60 minutes. The edge of the thin fibrin lens 3804 is barely visible in the picture. \n\n [0880] Fig. 38D shows a picture of the lens covering of Figs. 38A, 38B and 38C on the patient with a bandage contact lens (BCL) placed over the thin fibrin flap covering after 90 minutes. The edge of the thin fibrin lens 3806 is barely visible in the picture. It was observed in this eye that the fibrin covering made a small indentation indicative of pressure applied to the covering with the contact lens, such that the covering can be located at substantially the same location so as to resist a blink of an eyelid, and may be configured to adhere to and/or seal the cornea as described above.\n\n\n[0881] Figs. 38E-I and 38E-2 show OCT images of the covering of Figs. 38A-38D with a contact lens 3808 placed over the cornea and the covering 3810 conforming to the cornea. Fig. 38E-1 shows an OCT image of the center of the cornea and shows the bandage contact lens placed over the thin fibrin lens covering with the covering conforming to the surface of the cornea. Fig. 38E-2 shows an OCT image of the edge of the thin lens 3812 covering under the bandage contact lens., with the thin fibrin lens covering conforming to the shape of the cornea. [0882] Examples of additional covering materials that can be tested for conformance to the cornea and optical properties include 8 configurations were as follows: Hydrogel and PET; Dialysis Membrane (3mm); Collagen (sheepskin); TissealTM Sheet (5mm) ; BioGlue Sheet (3mm); TissealTM Sheet (8mm); Air Dried; Hydrogel CL (5mm and 8mm trephine); Lamellar \"LASIK\" Flap Created. [0883] Figs. 39A to 39C show optical images through casting of a U.S. Air Force resolution target and improvements in optical characteristics of the castings in response to improvements to the casting materials and process. Fig. 39A shows a standard formulation of fibrin. Fig. 39B shows a custom formulation of fibrin. Fig. 39C shows a cast custom formulation. These optical images show that the optical quality of the fibrin formulation can be improved significantly with the custom formulation and casting.\n\n\n[0884] 1. Standard Fibrin Formulation Membrane:\n\n\n[0885] The fibrinogen component of a standard fibrin sealant such as TissealTM (Baxter Biosurgery) is reconstituted with half of the supplied aprotinin solution at 37\n0\nC on a heated stir plate such as FibrothermTM, Baxter Biosurgery, by stirring for at least 5 minutes. Once the lyophilize is completely dissolved, the solution is allowed to sit for at least 30 minutes until all entrapped air bubbles have dissipated. The thrombin component is reconstituted with the supplied 40 mM CaC12 solution, then diluted 9: 1 v/v with more 40 mM CaC12, to \n\n produce a 50 unit/mL thrombin solution. Each component is loaded into syringes, taking care to not introduce air bubbles, and mounted into a dual syringe tissue adhesive applicator such as DuploJect from Baxter Biosurgery. An applicator tip either with or without an in-line static mixer, is attached to the end of the syringe joiner piece. Glass slides are prepared by adhering w/medical device grade cyanoacrylate metal shim strips (approximately 25 um thick) along the edges, then washing and rinsing. An amount of the two part mixture is then applied to the glass slide sufficient to cover it, then another clean glass slide without shim strips is placed atop the solution and pressed down gently but firmly onto the shim strips. The glass slide assembly containing the entrapped fibrin is allowed to incubate at room temperature overnight. Once the gel has dried, the glass slides are pried apart, the fibrin rinsed with saline, and peeled off, then washed and rinsed in several changes of sterile saline and allowed to dry again and trephined to produce circular implants. The membranes are then placed in appropriate packaging and sterilized by gamma radiation (approximately 25 kGy). Prior to application onto the cornea, the membrane is rehydrated with saline. [0886] 2. Optically Clear Custom Fibrin Formulation Membrane:\n\n\n[0887] To produce an optically clear fibrin membrane, the fibrinogen component of the fibrin sealant is reconstituted with only half of the supplied aprotinin solution in the same manner as for the standard formulation. The thrombin is reconstituted with 300 mM NaCI and 40 mM to produce a 50 U/mL solution. The membrane production then proceeds in the same manner as for the standard fibrin formulation. [0888] 3. BSA-Glutaraldehyde Membrane:\n\n\n[0889] Sterile 30% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-AIdrich) is loaded into a syringe. A 4% glutaraldehyde solution is prepared and loaded into a second syringe. Both components are loaded onto a dual syringe tissue adhesive applicator such as DuploJect from Baxter Biosurgery) either with or without a static inline mixer. The membrane is then produced in the same manner as for the fibrin membranes, except more rinsing is used in order to remove unbound glutaraldehyde prior to gamma sterilization.\n\n\n[0890] The optical and conforming properties of the covering can be improved with and improved casting process based on empirical laboratory and clinical studies, such that the covering can provide improved vision, for example 20/20 vision through the covering as measured with the air force resolution target. An improved casting process may comprise improving the mixing of the two solutions (fibrinogen and thrombin). For example by using a static mixer attached to the applicator. That way inhomogeneities in the ratios between the two components can be minimized or eliminated completely. A person can cast other fibrin \n\n formulations this way and the cast formulation can appear much more visually homogeneous. Such casting formulations can be made by one of ordinary skill in the art with time to do make this specific formulation, which can be the very clear fibrin. Further, laser ablation to affect further thinning of the material can result in improved optical quality, for example by rendering the covering clearer and this improvement may be quantified, for example by measuring the minimum angle of resolution of images through the covering. Also, gamma irradiation of the cast membrane can clarify the covering further. This has been observed with the clinical material as these materials have been laser thinned and gamma irradiated before human use. [0891] Fig. 40 shows a picture of an annular band, or skirt with a wire made with the method of Figs. 30A to 30C that can be placed over a contact lens to adhere the contact lens to the cornea. The annular band is clearly visible in the picture. The wire extends horizontally along the band and is embedded in the band as described above. The wire successfully penetrated the underlying contact lens and anchored in the underlying stroma. The annular band can be adhered to a contact lens, for example and RGP contact lens so as to adhere the contact lens to the cornea with the annular band.\n\n\n[0892] Pain Management:\n\n\n[0893] Experimentally it has been observed that edema can be caused by both a lack of water barrier function and decrease of oxygen. The thin lens covering can provide pain management both mechanically and metabolically. From a mechanical standpoint, the thin lens covering can provide a barrier against rubbing between the debrided zone and the inside of the eye lid. The thin lens covering may also comprise a barrier sealed against the epithelium so as to inhibit water entering the debrided area. From a metabolic standpoint, the thin lens covering comprises oxygen permeability so as to provide the oxygenation needed for corneal epithelium healing. For epithelial re-growth of the debrided epithelium, the oxygen requirement of the epithelium growing over the defect can much higher than for intact epithelium. Without adequate oxygenation, the epithelium may shifts the metabolic pathway away from producing the carbon dioxide to producing lactic acid. The lactic acid can cause hyperosmosis in the epithelial and stromal layers and draw water into these layers which, in turn, may cause the cornea to swell. The decreased oxygen of the cornea may also cause nerve activation manifested by pain, for example nerve activation due to increase swelling. \n\n [0894| Figs. 41 A, 41 B and 41 C shows uncorrected visual acuity, corneal edema, and epithelial defect area over time for patients treated with a therapeutic covering as described above, and control patients receiving a commercially available therapeutic bandage lens loosely fit to the cornea in accordance with known clinical methods of post PRK patient treatment. These data were obtained from clinical studies undertaken with PRK patients in accordance with the above described protocols. The data are shown for 17 patients for the control group and 10 test patients receiving the tested device.\n\n\n[0895] Data are shown of patients' uncorrected visual acuity readings from 0 to 72 hours post-PRK. The data shows the UCVA of 17 control patients wearing either Oasys Acuvue or Night & Day CIBA Vision silicone hydrogel bandage lenses. Ten patients wore a thin lens flap covering comprising NuSiI and plasma treated with carboxylated surface on the front surface, covered by a silicone hydrogel bandage lens for the acuity reading. The UCVA measurements were taken at 0, 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours. The patients wearing a silicone thin lens flap and on top of it a silicone hydrogel bandage contact lens for the purpose of the UCVA measurement, had better UCVA than the control group wearing a bandage lens only; at 72 hours the UCVA values for both sets of patients largely corresponded\n\n\n[0896] The uncorrected visual acuity of the patients with the test silicone covering had a mean uncorrected visual acuity (20/XX) of 0.5 at about I hour post-op, and the controls with the hydrogel bandage had a mean visual acuity of about 0.4 at about 1 hour post-op. At one day post-op, the test patients had an acuity of about 0.75 and the controls had a visual acuity of about 0.55. At two days post-op the test patients had a visual acuity of about 0.60 and the control patients had a visual acuity of about 0.45. These data show that the therapeutic covering can improve vision at a plurality of days comprising days one and two post-op, and one of ordinary skill in the art can improve vision based on the teachings described herein. At day three post-op, the test patients and the control patients each have similar visual acuities of about 0.6. Work in relation to the tested embodiments suggests that the regenerated epithelium at day three may comprise some irregularities, and that one can improve the optical surface of the covering so as to improve the patient vision at day three based on the teachings described herein.\n\n\n[0897] Data of patients' edema are shown from 0-72 hours post-PRK. The data shows the edema thickness (in um) of 17 control patients wearing either Oasys Acuvue or Night & Day CIBA Vision silicone hydrogel bandage lenses. Ten patients wore a thin lens flap covering \n\n comprising NuSiI and plasma treated with carboxylated hydrocarbon surface on the front surface. The patients wearing a silicone thin lens flap had less edema than the control group wearing a bandage lens only; at 72 hours the edema values for both sets of patients were quite close.\n\n\n[0898] The mean edema of the test patients with the test silicone covering was about 70 um at about 1 hour post-op, and the controls with the hydrogel bandage had a mean edema of about 80 um at about 1 hour post-op. The edema was calculated based on the pre-op corneal thickness as compared to post-op, and the calculated edema corrected for the ablation depth and the epithelial thickness. The mean edema of the test patients with the test silicone covering was about 15 um, about 3%, at about 4 hours post-op, and the controls with the hydrogel bandage had a mean edema of about 45 um, about 10%, at about 4 hours post-op. The mean edema of the test patients with the test silicone covering was about 3 um at about 24 hours post-op, less than 1 %, and the controls with the hydrogel bandage had a mean edema of about 45 um, about 10%, at about 24 hours post-op. The mean edema of the test patients with the test silicone covering was about 5 um, about 1 %, at about 48 hours post-op, and the controls with the hydrogel bandage had a mean edema of about 45%, about 10%, at about 48 hours post-op. Therefore, the test therapeutic covering reduced the mean edema to about 1 % or less for a plurality days comprising days one and two and the control patients showed an edema of about 10 % at these time periods. The mean edema of the test patients with the test silicone covering was about 15 um, about 3%, at about 72 hours post-op, and the controls with the hydrogel bandage had a mean edema of about 10 um, about 2%, at about 72 hours post-op. Work in relation to these studies suggest that oxygen permeability of the test covering may contribute to the corneal edema at day three post-op. Based on the teachings described herein, a person of ordinary skill in the art can decrease the permeability to decrease the edema of patients at day three post-op to within about 20 um, about 2%, or less, for example within about 10 um, about 1 %. The thickness of the covering may be decreased so as to increase the oxygen permeability Dk parameter, and the parameter determined empirically.\n\n\n[0899] Data are shown patients' epithelial defect size from 0-72 hours post-PRK. The data shows the edema thickness (in um) of 17 control patients wearing either Oasys Acuvue or Night & Day CIBA Vision silicone hydrogel bandage lenses. Ten patients wore a thin lens flap covering comprising NuSiI and plasma treated with carboxylated hydrocarbon surface on the front surface. The patients wearing a silicone thin lens flap had a larger epithelial defect \n\n size from 24 to approximately 72 hours than the control group wearing a bandage lens only; at 72 hours the epithelial defect had closed for both the control and the thin lens flap patients.\n\n\n[0900] The mean epithelial defect area of the test patients with the test silicone covering was about 15 mm\n2\n at about 24 hours post-op, and the controls with the hydrogel bandage had a mean epithelial defect area of 15 mm\n2\n at about 24 hour post-op. The mean epithelial defect area of the test patients with the test silicone covering was about 5 mm\n2\n at about 48 hours post-op, and the controls with the hydrogel bandage had a mean epithelial defect area of 2 mm at about 48 hour post-op. The mean epithelial defect area of the test patients with the test silicone covering was about 0 mm\n2\n at about 72 hours post-op, and the controls with the hydrogel bandage had a mean epithelial defect area of 0 mm\n2\n at about 24 hour post-op, such that both groups were substantially re-epithelial ized by day three post-op. Further studies can be conducted to determine whether a covering with an increased oxygen permeability can result in faster repithelialization.\n\n\n[0901] Fig. 42 shows an optical coherence tomography image of the clinically tested therapeutic covering adhered to an eye so as to remodel the epithelium near the edge of the 9 mm diameter covering. The image also shows a bandage lens positioned over the covering. The image shows the covering adhered to the epithelium such that the covering induced an irregularity of the epithelium near the edge of the covering. The epithelium has grown over the covering slightly at the periphery and extends under the covering for a substantial distance, such that the cornea is sealed with the covering and the epithelium. The covering was adhered to the eye with the bandage lens removed. This data shows the covering adhered to the cornea with endothelial suction. A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the periphery of the covering may be thinned so as to inhibit or minimize the irregularity of the epithelium at the periphery, based on the teachings described herein. As the endothelial suction was sufficient to induct the peripheral irregularity of the epithelium, the rigidity of the inner portion may be configured to smooth the epithelium, based on the teachings described herein.\n\n\n[0902] Fig. 42A shows an optical coherence tomography image of a therapeutic covering conforming to an epithelial layer of a PRK patient at 24 hours post-op. The covering conforms to the epithelial defect, so as to seal the cornea. The covering comprises a silicon material having a thickness of about 50 um and a Shore A durometer of about 30. The \n\n epithelium is shown growing under the covering and continued to grow such that the eye re- epithelial ized under the covering.\n\n\n[0903] Fig. 43 shows an optical coherence tomography image of a therapeutic covering conforming to a de-epithelialized porcine eye. The pig eye was enucleated and debrided. The diameter of the debrided zone is approximately 2.5 mm. The thickness of the epithelium is shown as approximately 0.06 mm.\n\n\n[0904] The thin lens flap covering comprises NuSiI grade 4930 and with a carboxylated plasma treated anterior surface has been draped over the debrided zone. The thin lens flap covering conforms to the surface of the eye, leaving no gaps between the posterior/bottom part of the lens and the surface of the cornea. The covering is shown conforming to irregularities of the cornea, including irregularities of the epithelium and stroma, such as the boundary of the epithelial defect. The covering comprised a thickness of about 50 um and a Shore A durometer of about 30. These data suggest suitable parameters for the peripheral portion such that the peripheral portion can conform to irregularities of the epithelium so as to seal the cornea, and that the inner portion may comprise a durometer of more than 30 when the inner portion is no more than about 50 um thick.\n\n\n[0905] A person of ordinary skill in the art can conduct empirical studies to determine material properties, coatings and dimensions of a therapeutic covering for use after photorefractive keratectomy so as to provide improved water barrier function, decreased pain and increased visual acuity for days one to three post-op, even from days one to seven post- op. For example, a decreased thickness of the flap can result in decreased edema at three days post-op and may improve visual acuity at three days post-op. For example, parameters can be determined for a therapeutic covering so as to decrease average edema to no more than about 5%, decrease average pain, and provide an average visual acuity of at least about 20/30 or better in a population of patients for days one to three post. For example, the above experimental findings indicate that a thinner silicone flap can decrease swelling at days 1 and 3 post-op.\n\n\n[0906] Clinical studies in accordance with the above described embodiments have shown that the cornea may comprise may corneal irregularities following PRK, and that the covering can decrease many of these irregularities. The irregularities can correspond to optical aberrations that decrease patient vision. In the first one to three days following PRK, the cornea can swell. The swelling of the corneal stroma can result in stromal irregularities. For example \n\n the stroma can swell so as to produce a central island, which can resolve when swelling is decreased and the epithelium covers the stroma and/or Bowman's. A central island may comprise an under ablated central portion that produces optical aberrations. Also, the boundary at the edge of the ablation may comprise a stroma irregularity. Clinical studies the PentacamTM and topography systems have shown epithelial irregularities comprising the edge of the epithelial defect, and the epithelium can be somewhat irregular, even though the epithelium can cover the cornea. The epithelial irregularities may last for at least one week following PRK. [0907] The empirical studies may comprise laboratory studies, for example of conformance of a covering to a target shape. For example, the covering can be placed over a 7.5 mm radius of curvature surface with a 2 mm hole in the middle of the test surface to simulate a corneal irregularity. With a inner portion that may be more soft than ideal, the inner portion may droop over the hole. The hardness and/or thickness of the inner portion can be increased such that the inner portion retains the optical shape and does not droop over the hole. For example, experiments have suggested that a 50 um uniform thickness covering with a Shore A durometer of 30 may droop slightly such that a thicker and/or harder covering may provide improved clinical results. Patients may be tested subsequent to laboratory testing to optimize empirically the parameter of the therapeutic covering so as to achieve the above stated functions such as edema less than 5% and visual acuity of 20/30 or better. [0908] An example of a therapeutic covering in accordance with the above may comprise a single piece of molded silicon having a water content of no more than about 2%, an outer portion with an outer size of about 7 to 9 mm across, for example 8 mm diameter, an inner portion with a size of about 3 to 5 mm across, for example 4 mm diameter. The silicone may comprise hardness corresponding to a Shore A durometer from within a range about 30 to about 70, for example a uniform hardness corresponding to a durometer of about 40. The thickness of the outer portion at the periphery may comprise about 10 to 40 microns across, for example 20 microns. The thickness can gradually increase toward an inner boundary of the outer portion having a thickness within a range from about 40 to 80 microns. The central portion may comprise an uniform thickness within a range from about 80 to 120 microns across, for example 100 microns. The covering comprising the molded single piece can be coated on the upper surface with a hydrophilic layer, for example a lubricous coating, and coated on the lower surface with a hydrophilic layer, for example a lubricous coating. The outer portion of the covering can conform to and seal against the undebrided epithelium and the peripheral Bowman's membrane with endothelial suction , as described above, and the \n\n central portion comprises an optical surface for vision which does not conform to irregularities of the epithelium or the ablated stroma. The oxygen permeability and corresponding Dk of the covering can exceed 350, for example 400 or even 500 or more, so as to inhibit or minimize pain and swelling when the epithelium regenerates. [0909J While the exemplary embodiments have been described in some detail, by way of example and for clarity of understanding, those of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of modifications, adaptations, and changes may be employed. Hence, the scope of the present invention should be limited solely by the appended claims and the full scope of the equivalents thereof."
