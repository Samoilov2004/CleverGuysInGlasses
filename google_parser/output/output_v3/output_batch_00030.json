Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/144,560 filed Jan. 14, 2009, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to the use of hydrazones in combination with copper, copper-based fungicides or other copper-containing materials as synergistic fungicidal mixtures.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nCopper is used to control the growth of organisms, especially microorganisms, in a variety of applications such as those described in the “Handbook of copper compounds and applications” edited by H. W. Richardson and published by Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York (1997), which is expressly incorporated by reference herein. These applications may include its use in agriculture to control a wide range of fungal and bacterial diseases of plants. Copper products may also be used as aquatic biocides in fresh or marine environments. Copper products may be used in antifouling applications and to control unwanted organisms in ponds and lakes based on the toxicity of copper towards algae, fungi, macrophytes and mollusks. Copper-based materials may also be used as wood preservatives and on other materials to inhibit fungal and bacterial growth. Other uses also include killing plant roots in sewer systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEcological risk assessment studies have shown that copper products, which normally are applied at high use rates, may be toxic to birds, mammals, fish and other aquatic species (“Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) for Coppers”, EPA 738-R-06-020, July 2006, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein). Thus, while copper is a highly useful agent for controlling the growth of undesirable organisms in different environments, it is desirable to minimize the amount of copper applied.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nOne exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure includes a synergistic mixture for controlling the growth of fungi, the synergistic mixture including copper and a hydrazone compound of Formula I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein A is oxygen or sulfur;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nZ is H or C1-C4 alkyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nW is —CHR1-;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nn is 0, 1, or 2;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR is H, C1-C6 alkyl, C2-C6 alkenyl, C2-C6 alkynyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl, C1-C6 haloalkyl, C2-C6 haloalkenyl C2-C6 haloalkynyl, or C3-C6 halocycloalkyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR1 is H, C1-C6 alkyl, C2-C6 alkenyl, C2-C6 alkynyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl, C1-C6 haloalkyl, C2-C6 haloalkenyl C2-C6 haloalkynyl, C3-C6 halocycloalkyl, substituted aryl, unsubstituted aryl, substituted heteroaryl, or unsubstituted heteroaryl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nX3, X4, X5, and X6 are each independently selected from the group consisting of H, halogen, nitro, hydroxyl, cyano, C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C4 alkoxy, C2-C4 alkenyl, C2-C4 alkynyl, C1-C4 alkylthio, C1-C4 haloalkyl, C1-C4 haloalkoxy, C2-C4 haloalkenyl, C2-C4 haloalkynyl, C1-C4 haloalkylthio, —SO\n2\nR1, SONR1R1, —CR1=NOR1, —CONR1R1, NR1COOR1, —COOR1, substituted aryl, substituted heteroaryl, unsubstituted aryl, and unsubstituted heteroaryl;

Rather, the embodiments selected for description have been chosen to enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention. Although the disclosure is described as a synergistic combination of copper, copper based fungicides, or other copper-containing materials and a hydrazone or hydrazone derivative it should be understood that the concepts presented herein may be used in various applications and should not be limited.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mixtures of the present invention have fungitoxic activity against phytopathogenic fungi, against fungal pathogens of mammals, including humans, and against wood decay causing fungi. The mixtures of the present invention may have broad spectrum fungitoxic activity, particularly against phytopathogenic fungi. They are active against fungi of a number of classes including Deuteromycetes (Fungi Imperfecti), Basidiomycetes, Oomycetes and Ascomycetes. More particularly, the method of this invention provides for activity against organisms including, but not limited to, \nPhytophthora \nspecies, \nPlasmopara viticola, Pseudoperonospora cubensis, Pythium \nspecies, \nPyricularia oryzae, Colletotrichum \nspecies, \nHelminthosporium \nspecies, \nAlternaria \nspecies, \nSeptoria nodorum, Leptosphaeria nodorum, Ustilago maydis, Erysiphe graminis, Puccinia \nspecies, \nSclerotinia \nspecies, \nSphaerotheca fuliginea, Cercospora \nspecies, \nRhizoctonia \nspecies, \nUncinula necator, Septoria tritici\n, and \nPodosphaera leucotricha. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method of the present invention also provides for activity against fungal pathogens of mammals (including humans) including, but not limited to, \nCandida \nspecies such as \nC. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei\n, and \nC. tropicalis, Aspergillus \nspecies such as \nAspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium \nspecies, \nCoccidioides immitis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, Microsporum \nspecies, and \nTricophyton \nspecies. The method of the present invention also provides for activity against fungi which cause wood decay such as \nGleophyllum trabeur, Phialophora mutabilis, Poria palcenta \nand \nTrametes versicolor. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention contemplates all vehicles by which the composition of the present invention can be formulated for delivery and use as a pesticide composition, including solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders and water dispersible granules, emulsifiable concentrates, granules, dusts, baits, and the like. Typically, formulations are applied following dilution of the concentrated formulation with water as aqueous solutions, suspensions or emulsions, or combinations thereof. Such solutions, suspensions or emulsions are produced from water-soluble, water-suspended or water-suspendable, water-emulsified or water-emulsifiable formulations or combinations thereof which are solids, including and usually known as wettable powders or water dispersible granules; or liquids including and usually known as emulsifiable concentrates, aqueous suspensions or suspension concentrates, and aqueous emulsions or emulsions in water, or mixtures thereof such as suspension-emulsions. As will be readily appreciated, any material to which this composition can be added may be used, provided they yield the desired utility without significant interference with the desired activity of the pesticidally active ingredients as pesticidal agents and improved residual lifetime or decreased effective concentration is achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWettable powders, which may be compacted to form water dispersible granules, comprise an intimate mixture of one or more of the pesticidally active ingredients, an inert carrier and surfactants. The concentration of the pesticidally active ingredient in the wettable powder is usually from about 10 percent to about 90 percent by weight based on the total weight of the wettable powder, more preferably about 25 weight percent to about 75 weight percent. In the preparation of wettable powder formulations, the pesticidally active ingredients can be compounded with any finely divided solid, such as prophyllite, talc, chalk, gypsum, Fuller's earth, bentonite, attapulgite, starch, casein, gluten, montmorillonite clays, diatomaceous earths, purified silicates or the like. In such operations, the finely divided carrier and surfactants are typically blended with the compound(s) and milled\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmulsifiable concentrates of the pesticidally active ingredient comprise a convenient concentration, such as from about 10 weight percent to about 50 weight percent of the pesticidally active ingredient, in a suitable liquid, based on the total weight of the concentrate. The pesticidally active ingredients are dissolved in an inert carrier, which is either a water miscible solvent or a mixture of water-immiscible organic solvents, and emulsifiers. The concentrates may be diluted with water and oil to form spray mixtures in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. Useful organic solvents include aromatics, especially the high-boiling naphthalenic and olefinic portions of petroleum such as heavy aromatic naphtha. Other organic solvents may also be used, such as, for example, terpenic solvents, including rosin derivatives, aliphatic ketones, such as cyclohexanone, and complex alcohols, such as 2-ethoxyethanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmulsifiers which can be advantageously employed herein can be readily determined by those skilled in the art and include various nonionic, anionic, cationic and amphoteric emulsifiers, or a blend of two or more emulsifiers. Examples of nonionic emulsifiers useful in preparing the emulsifiable concentrates include the polyalkylene glycol ethers and condensation products of alkyl and aryl phenols, aliphatic alcohols, aliphatic amines or fatty acids with ethylene oxide, propylene oxides such as the ethoxylated alkyl phenols and carboxylic esters esterified with the polyol or polyoxyalkylene. Cationic emulsifiers include quaternary ammonium compounds and fatty amine salts. Anionic emul-sifiers include the oil-soluble salts (e.g., calcium) of alkylaryl sulfonic acids, oil-soluble salts of sulfated polyglycol ethers and appropriate salts of phosphated polyglycol ether.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative organic liquids which can be employed in preparing emulsifiable concentrates are the aromatic liquids such as xylene, propyl benzene fractions; or mixed naphthalene fractions, mineral oils, substituted aromatic organic liquids such as dioctyl phthalate; kerosene; dialkyl amides of various fatty acids, particularly the dim-ethyl amides; and glycol ethers such as the n-butyl ether, ethyl ether or methyl ether of diethylene glycol, and the methyl ether of triethylene glycol and the like. Mixtures of two or more organic liquids may also be employed in the preparation of the emulsifiable concentrate. Surface-active emulsifying agents are typically employed in liquid formulations and in an amount of from 0.1 to 20 percent by weight based on the combined weight of the emulsifying agents. The formulations can also contain other compatible additives, for example, plant growth regulators and other biologically active compounds used in agriculture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous suspensions comprise suspensions of one or more water-insoluble pesticidally active ingredients dispersed in an aqueous vehicle at a concentration in the range from about 5 to about 50 weight percent, based on the total weight of the aqueous suspension. Suspensions are prepared by finely grinding one or more of the pesticidally active ingredients, and vigorously mixing the ground material into a vehicle comprised of water and surfactants chosen from the same types discussed above. Other components, such as inor-ganic salts and synthetic or natural gums, may also be added to increase the density and viscosity of the aqueous vehicle. It is often most effective to grind and mix at the same time by preparing the aqueous mixture and homogenizing it in an implement such as a sand mill, ball mill, or piston-type homogenizer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous emulsions comprise emulsions of one or more water-insoluble pesticidally active ingredients emulsified in an aqueous vehicle at a concentration typically in the range from about 5 to about 50 weight percent, based on the total weight of the aqueous emulsion. If the pesticidally active ingredient is a solid it must be dissolved in a suitable water-immiscible solvent prior to the preparation of the aqueous emulsion. Emulsions are prepared by emulsifying the liquid pesticidally active ingredient or water-immiscible solution thereof into an aqueous medium typically with inclusion of surfactants that aid in the formation and stabilization of the emulsion as described above. This is often accomplished with the aid of vigorous mixing provided by high shear mixers or homogenizers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention can also be granular formulations, which are particularly useful for applications to the soil. Granular formulations usually contain from about 0.5 to about 10 weight percent, based on the total weight of the granular formulation of the pesticidally active ingredient(s), dispersed in an inert carrier which consists entirely or in large part of coarsely divided inert material such as attapulgite, bentonite, diatomite, clay or a similar inexpensive substance. Such formulations are usually prepared by dissolving the pesticidally active ingredients in a suitable solvent and applying it to a granular carrier which has been preformed to the appropriate particle size, in the range of from about 0.5 to about 3 mm A suitable solvent is a solvent in which the compound is substantially or completely soluble. Such formulations may also be prepared by making a dough or paste of the carrier and the compound and solvent, and crushing and drying to obtain the desired granular particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDusts can be prepared by intimately mixing one or more of the pesticidally active ingredients in powdered form with a suitable dusty agricultural carrier, such as, for example, kaolin clay, ground volcanic rock, and the like. Dusts can suitably contain from about 1 to about 10 weight percent of the compounds, based on the total weight of the dust.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations may additionally contain adjuvant surfactants to enhance deposition, wetting and penetration of the pesticidally active ingredients onto the target site such as a crop or organism. These adjuvant surfactants may optionally be employed as a component of the formulation or as a tank mix. The amount of adjuvant surfactant will typically vary from 0.01 to 1.0 percent by volume, based on a spray-volume of water, preferably 0.05 to 0.5 volume percent. Suitable adjuvant surfactants include, but are not limited to ethoxylated nonyl phenols, ethoxylated synthetic or natural alcohols, salts of the esters of sulfosuccinic acids, ethoxylated organosilicones, ethoxylated fatty amines and blends of surfactants with mineral or vegetable oils.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations may optionally include combinations that contain other pesticidal compounds.

The exact amounts of hydrazones and copper-containing materials to be applied is dependent not only on the specific materials being applied and relative amounts of hydrazone and copper in the mixtures, but also on the, the particular action desired, the fungal species to be controlled, and the stage of growth thereof, as well as the part of the plant or other product to be contacted with the mixture. Thus, all the mixtures, and formulations containing the same, may not be equally effective at similar concentrations or against the same fungal species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mixtures are effective in use with plants in a disease-inhibiting and phytologically acceptable amount. The term “disease inhibiting and phytologically acceptable amount” refers to an amount of a mixture that kills or inhibits the plant disease for which control is desired, but is not significantly toxic to the plant. The exact amount of a mixture required varies with the fungal disease to be controlled, the type of formulation employed, the method of application, the particular plant species, climate conditions, and the like. The dilution and rate of application will depend upon the type of equipment employed, the method and frequency of application desired and diseases to be controlled. For foliar control of fungal infections on plants, the amount of copper used in mixture with hydrazone may range from 0.001 to 5 kg/ha, and preferably from 0.05 to 1 kg/ha. The amount of hydrazone used in mixture with copper may range from 0.001 to 5 kg/ha, and preferably from 0.05 to 1 kg/ha. The molar ratio of copper to hydrazone may range from 0.1:1 to 10, 000:1, preferably from 0.5:1 to 1000:1 and more preferably from 1:1 to 20:1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that the preferred amount of a copper material to be mixed with hydrazone in a given application may be influenced by availability of copper from other sources such as copper present in the soil or irrigation water, copper present on the foliage from natural sources, copper applied for fungal or bacterial disease control, copper applied as a fertilizer component, copper present in the water used in preparing fungicide solutions for application such as in spray application, copper present in formulations used in preparing spray solutions or dusts for application, or any other suitable copper source.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor fungal control the hydrazone may be applied before or after the application of copper such that the mixture is generated in the location where fungal control is desired. Additionally, multiple applications of copper or the hydrazone may be applied.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a seed protectant, the amount of toxicant coated on the seed is usually at a dosage rate of about 10 to about 250 grams (g) and preferably from about 20 to about 60 g per 50 kilograms of seed. As a soil fungicide, the chemical can be incorporated in the soil or applied to the surface usually at a rate of 0.5 to about 20 kg and preferably about 1 to about 5 kg per hectare.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for preparation of salicylaldehyde benzoylhydrazones and 2-hydroxyphenylketone benzoylhydrazones from salicylaldehydes or 2-hydroxyphenyl ketones and a benzoic hydrazide are well known in the literature. In addition the preparation of metal complexes of these materials is also well known (see for example \nJournal of Inorganic Biochemistry \n1999, 77, 125-133, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein). Methods of preparation of precursor hydrazides are also well known. Hydrazides can be prepared, for example, from carboxylic acids such as in Maxwell et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n1984, 27, 1565-1570, and from carboxylic esters such as in Dydio et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n2009, 74, 1525-1530, which are expressly incorporated by reference herein. Thus, the synthesis of any benzoylhydrazone of the present invention and its metal complex(es) is fully described where the starting aldehyde or ketone, and the starting benzoic hydrazide, acid, or ester are described. The hydrazones disclosed may also be in the form of pesticidally acceptable salts and hydrates. Examples 23, 24, and 25 below provide typical methods for the preparation of such benzoylhydrazones. Example 31 below provides a general method for the preparation of their metal complexes.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nPreparation of 1-(3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-2,2,2-trifluoroethanone\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2,4-Dichloro-6-iodophenol (2.0 grams (g), 6.9 millimoles (mmol)) was dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF; 20 milliliters (mL)), cooled to −30 to −40° C., treated in portions with isopropyl magnesium chloride-lithium chloride complex (1.3 M in THF; 7.3 mmol) and stirred for 45 minutes (min) as the temperature was allowed to rise to 0° C.

below, hydrazones of the present invention, or their metal complexes, in a mixture with inorganic or organic mono- or divalent copper salts or chelates (hereinafter referred to as “copper products”) increase the biological potency of copper products, enabling comparable or improved efficacy at lower copper use rates. While not intending to be all-inclusive, copper products which may be mixed with the compounds of the present invention to provide enhanced potency may include the following: copper oxychloride, copper octanoate, copper ammonium carbonate, copper arsenate, copper oxysulfate, copper formate, copper propionate, copper oxyacetate, copper citrate, copper chloride, copper diammonium chloride, copper nitrate, copper carbonate, copper phosphate, copper pyrophosphate, copper disodium EDTA, copper diammonium EDTA, copper oxalate, copper tartrate, copper gluconate, copper glycinate, copper glutamate, copper aspartate, copper adipate, copper palmitate, copper stearate, copper caprylate, copper decanoate, copper undecylenate, copper neodecanoate, copper linoleate, copper oleate, copper borate, copper methanesulfonate, copper sulfamate, copper acetate, copper hydroxide, copper oxide, copper oxychloride-sulfate, copper sulfate, basic copper sulfate, copper-oxine, copper 3-phenylsalicylate, copper chloride hydroxide, copper dimethyldithiocarbamate, ammonium copper sulfate, copper magnesium sulfate, coppernaphthenate, copper ethanolamine, chromated copper arsenate, ammoniacal copper arsenate, ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate, ammoniacal copper borate, Bordeaux mixture, copper zinc chromate, cufraneb, cupric hydrazinium sulfate, cuprobam, nano-copper materials and copper didecyldimethylammonium chloride and where appropriate the hydrates of such compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSalicylaldehyde benzoylhydrazones such as those of the current invention are known in the literature as chelators of metal cations (\nInorganica Chimica Acta \n1982, 67, L25-L27, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein), including copper. Antimicrobial activity has been reported for o-hydroxybenzaldehyde-N-salicyloylhydrazone and its copper, nickel and cobalt complexes towards \nStaphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger \nand \nA. flavus \n(\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\n, India 1991, Section A Part IV, Vol. LXI, pp. 447-452, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein). However, data in this report showed that the copper complex of o-hydroxybenzaldehyde-N-salicyloylhydrazone had a similar level of antimicrobial activity to that of o-hydroxybenzaldehyde-N-salicyloylhydrazone alone and the nickel and cobalt complexes, and provided no indication that salicylaldehyde benzoylhydrazones might show any synergistic antimicrobial effect in combination with copper.\n\n\n \nExample 26\n\n\nEffect of Copper on Fungitoxicity of Hydrazones Towards \nLeptosphaeria nodorum \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn vitro fungitoxicity assays against \nLeptosphaeria nodorum \n(LEPTNO) were conducted using the liquid growth medium described by Coursen and Sisler (\nAmerican Journal of Botany \n1960, 47, 541-549) except that copper micronutrient, normally included as CuSO\n4\n, was omitted. The medium, termed “copper-minus”, was prepared by dissolving 10 g glucose, 1.5 g K\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 2 g KH\n2\nPO\n4 \nand 1 g (NH\n4\n)\n2\nSO\n4 \nin 1 liter of deionized water and treating the solution with 0.5 g Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad Analytical grade, 50-100 mesh, sodium form, cat# 142-2822) by stiffing at room temperature for 1 h. MgSO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO (0.5 g) was added, and stiffing continued for a further hour. Trace elements (minus CuSO\n4\n), and vitamins described by Coursen and Sisler were added from concentrated stock solutions and the entire medium was sterilized by filtration. Medium containing copper was prepared by adding CuCl\n2\n.2H\n2\nO to the copper-minus medium at 20 μM. Test compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) then dilutions in copper-minus and copper-plus growth media were prepared as 100 μL aliquots in flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLEPTNO was grown on potato dextrose agar in 9 cm diameter petri dishes for 7 days. Sterile deionized water (20 mL) was added to a culture plate and spores suspended by scraping the surface gently with a sterile plastic loop. The resulting suspension was filtered through a double layer of sterile cheesecloth. Filtered spore suspension (5 mL) was centrifuged in a bench centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 2 min. The resulting spore pellet was resuspended in 10 mL sterile deionized water (which had been treated with Chelex 100 resin using 0.5 g resin per liter of water by stirring at room temperature for 1 h), and recentrifuged. The spores were resuspended in copper-minus medium, and the suspension adjusted to 2×10\n5 \nspores per mL. Microtiter plates were inoculated with 100 μL of this spore suspension and the plates incubated at 25° C. for 72 h before assessing fungal growth by measuring light scattering in a NepheloStar plate reader. Growth inhibition was determined by comparing growth in the presence of test compound with growth in control wells lacking test compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults for growth inhibition by test compounds in copper-plus medium (“% Inhn. Plus Copper Observed”) were compared with predicted values (“% Inhn. Plus Copper Predicted”) that were calculated using the formula set forth by S. R. Colby in Weeds 1967, 15, 20-22 based on results obtained for the same compounds in copper-minus medium (“% Inhn. Minus Copper Observed”) and the inhibition attributed to copper chloride alone, as determined by comparing growth in copper-minus and copper-plus media without any test compound across experiments. Data are presented in Table 3. Results illustrate that hydrazones and copper produce a synergistic fungitoxic effect towards LEPTNO.\n\n\n \nExample 27\n\n\nEfficacy of Hydrazones in Mixture with Copper Against Tomato Blight (\nPhytophthora infestans\n)\n\n\n \n \n \nHydrazone compounds at 50 ppm in combination with 50 μM CuCl\n2\n.2H\n2\nO were evaluated as prophylactic treatments applied 24 h before inoculation. Efficacy was determined based on percentage of disease control against tomato late blight (TLB), causal agent \nPhytophthora infestans\n. Treatments were arranged in a completely randomized design with 3 repetitions each. A pot with one tomato plant was considered as an experimental unit. Hydrazones were dissolved in acetone and re-suspended in water containing 0.01% Triton® X-100, 0.1% Atlox 4913 and 50 μM CuCl\n2\n.2H\n2\nO to a final concentration of 10% acetone. All treatments were applied to run off 24 h before inoculation using a spin-table sprayer. Inoculation with an aqueous suspension of \nP. infestans \nsporangia was performed using a Delta painting sprayer. Percentage of disease control was determined 7 days after inoculation. Data are presented in Table 2, and illustrate the efficacy of hydrazones in mixture with copper for control of tomato late blight.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

The medium, termed “copper-minus AS”, was prepared by dissolving 2 g asparagine, 0.43 g KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.3 g K\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.4 mL of a 0.5 mg/mL thiamine-HCl solution and 15 g sucrose in 1 liter of deionized water and treating the solution with 0.5 g Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad Analytical grade, 50-100 mesh, sodium form, cat# 142-2822) by stiffing at room temperature for 1 h. The pH was adjusted to 6.4, then MgSO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO (100 μg/mL), FeSO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO (1 μg/mL), CaCl\n2 \n(50 μg/mL), ZnSO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO (1 μg/mL), NaMoO\n4\n.2H\n2\nO (0.2 μg/mL) and MnCl\n2\n.4H\n2\nO (0.2 μg/mL) were added and the entire medium was sterilized by filtration. “Copper-plus AS” medium was prepared by adding CuCl\n2\n.2H\n2\nO to the copper-minus AS medium at 100 μM. Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO then dilutions in copper-minus AS and copper-plus AS media were prepared as 100 μL aliquots in flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPhytophthora capsici \nwas grown on petri plates, 9 cm in diameter, containing 15 mL V-8 agar, pH 7.0, containing 200 mL V-8 juice, 4 g CaCO\n3\n, and 20 g agar per liter. Plates were inoculated with 7-mm plugs from a 1-week old culture, incubated at 25° C. in the dark for 3 days, and then placed under fluorescent lights for 4 days to induce sporulation. Zoospore release from sporangia was induced by adding 15 mL of sterile deionized water (which had been treated with Chelex 100 resin using 0.5 g resin per liter of water by stiffing at room temperature for 1 h) to each plate, and incubating for 10 min at 25° C. followed by 20 min at 4° C. The plates were returned to 25° C. for 10 min and the aqueous suspension of released zoospores was recovered. The zoospore suspension was adjusted to 5×10\n4 \nspores/mL by dilution into Chelex 100-treated water. Microtiter plates were inoculated with 100 μL of spore suspension and incubated at 25° C. for 48 h before assessing fungal growth by measuring light scattering in a NepheloStar plate reader. Growth inhibition was determined by comparing growth in the presence of test compound with growth in control wells lacking test compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults for growth inhibition by test compounds in copper-plus AS medium (“% Inhn. Plus Copper Observed”) were compared with predicted values (“% Inhn. Plus Copper Predicted”) that were calculated using the formula set forth by S. R. Colby in Weeds (1967), 15, 20-22 based on results obtained for the same compounds in copper-minus AS medium (“% Inhn. Minus Copper Observed”) and the inhibition attributed to copper chloride alone, as determined by comparing growth in copper-minus AS and copper-plus AS media without any test compound across experiments. Data are presented in Table 3. Results illustrate that hydrazones and copper produce a synergistic fungitoxic effect towards \nPhytophthora capsici\n.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% Inhn\n\n\n% Inhn\n\n\n% Inhn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMinus\n\n\nPlus\n\n\nPlus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nConcentration\n\n\ncopper\n\n\ncopper\n\n\ncopper\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber\n\n\n(μg/mL)\n\n\nObserved\n\n\nObserved\n\n\nPredicted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n9.7\n\n\n87.2\n\n\n13.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n88.5\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n18.6\n\n\n93.9\n\n\n22.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n28.8\n\n\n95.8\n\n\n32.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n87.2\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n80.4\n\n\n91.8\n\n\n81.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n91.9\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n90.4\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n90.0\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n10.8\n\n\n93.8\n\n\n14.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n10.2\n\n\n92.4\n\n\n14.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n11.4\n\n\n93.8\n\n\n15.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n54.2\n\n\n90.3\n\n\n56.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n40.6\n\n\n91.2\n\n\n43.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n57.5\n\n\n94.1\n\n\n59.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n76.4\n\n\n8.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n17.6\n\n\n95.6\n\n\n21.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n69\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n87.6\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n74\n\n\n5\n\n\n17.2\n\n\n89.4\n\n\n20.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n83\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n27.9\n\n\n96.2\n\n\n31.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n84\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n47.5\n\n\n95.0\n\n\n49.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n91\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n52.1\n\n\n93.2\n\n\n54.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n96\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n55.2\n\n\n91.9\n\n\n57.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n99\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n23.6\n\n\n94.0\n\n\n27.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n88.8\n\n\n14.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n101\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n70.0\n\n\n88.2\n\n\n71.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n102\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n15.7\n\n\n93.6\n\n\n19.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n119\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n37.9\n\n\n95.1\n\n\n40.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n121\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n90.4\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n123\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n16.3\n\n\n94.8\n\n\n20.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n124\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n25.0\n\n\n89.7\n\n\n28.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n125\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n66.6\n\n\n89.4\n\n\n68.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n129\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n10.6\n\n\n96.3\n\n\n14.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n131\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n5.6\n\n\n93.7\n\n\n9.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n140\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n91.4\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n143\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n94.5\n\n\n10.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n146\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n11.8\n\n\n91.4\n\n\n15.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n162\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n5.2\n\n\n91.6\n\n\n9.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n177\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n92.4\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n182\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n25.9\n\n\n90.9\n\n\n29.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n183\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n88.9\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n204\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n81.9\n\n\n10.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n207\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n88.9\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n210\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n36.6\n\n\n92.7\n\n\n39.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n218\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n10.7\n\n\n93.3\n\n\n14.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n219\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n15.3\n\n\n90.6\n\n\n19.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n220\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n13.4\n\n\n85.5\n\n\n17.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n221\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n12.0\n\n\n92.2\n\n\n15.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n222\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n11.3\n\n\n76.8\n\n\n15.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n223\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n51.3\n\n\n6.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n224\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n93.3\n\n\n10.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n225\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n11.4\n\n\n82.8\n\n\n15.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n226\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n62.1\n\n\n6.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n227\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n93.4\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n228\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n86.9\n\n\n14.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n229\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n89.1\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n230\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n5.8\n\n\n93.6\n\n\n10.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n275\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n91.2\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n277\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n88.2\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n320\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n81.4\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n337\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n42.1\n\n\n9.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n351\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n87.9\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n364\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n23.2\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n369\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n44.5\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n384\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n71.1\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n405\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n85.9\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n427\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n9.1\n\n\n88.6\n\n\n13.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n443\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n91.2\n\n\n6.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n455\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n30.8\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n578\n\n\n0.050\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n90.4\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCuCl\n2\n, 50 μM\n\n\n \n\n\n4.5 ± 7.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 29\n\n\nEffect of Copper on Fungitoxicity of Hydrazones Towards \nUstilago maydis \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn vitro fungitoxicity assays against \nUstilago maydis \nwere conducted using the copper-minus medium described in Example 26.

Metal complexes of hydrazones were prepared by precipitation from ethanol with various metal salts, at 1:1, 2:1 or 3:1 molar ratios, as described in general by Ainscough, Brodie, Dobbs, Ranford, and Waters (\nInorganica Chimica Acta \n1998, 267, 27-38, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA general synthesis of 1:1 metal-hydrazone complexes is as follows. The starting salicylaldehyde benzoylhydrazone or 2-hydroxyphenylketone benzoylhydrazone is dissolved (or suspended) in EtOH (generally 0.1 mmol hydrazone per mL solvent) and agitated at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 80° C. for 30 min. To this solution (or suspension) is added 1 equivalent of the metal salt (generally as a 1 M solution in EtOH). The mixture is agitated for a period ranging from 1 to 24 h at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 80° C. The metal-hydrazone complex generally precipitates during the reaction or upon cooling and is isolated by filtration, washed with EtOH and finally washed with Et\n2\nO. In the instances where the complex does not precipitate, the solvent is removed and the resulting solid metal-hydrazone complex is washed with Et\n2\nO. Properties of particular metal complexes of hydrazones are provided in Table 6 below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRatio\n\n\n \n\n\n

Test compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) then dilutions in copper-minus medium were prepared as 100 μL aliquots in flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates. Microtiter plates were inoculated with 100 μL of spore suspension at a concentration of 2×10\n5 \nspores per mL, prepared as in Example 26. The plates were incubated at 25° C. for 72 h before assessing fungal growth by measuring light scattering in a NepheloStar plate reader. Growth inhibition was determined by comparing growth in the presence of test compound with growth in control wells lacking test compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults for growth inhibition by hydrazones and corresponding isolated metal complexes (each at 0.1 μg/mL) are shown in Table 7. The results illustrate that isolated Cu complexes of hydrazones are much more fungitoxic than the corresponding hydrazones and also are much more active than isolated Fe, Mn and Zn complexes of hydrazones.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCom-\n\n\nCom-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHydrazone\n\n\nComplex\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplex\n\n\npound\n\n\n \n\n\nRa-\n\n\n%

against glume blotch of wheat (\nLeptosphaeria nodorum\n)\n\n\n \n \n \nHydrazones and their copper complexes were compared with respect to their ability to control glume blotch of wheat. Compound formulation was accomplished by dissolving technical materials in acetone and adding 9 volumes de-ionized water containing 0.01% Triton® X-100.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWheat (cultivar Yuma) was grown in a soilless peat-based potting mixture (“Metromix”) until the seedlings were 10-20 cm tall. These plants were then sprayed to run-off with the test compound at a rate of 200 ppm. After 24 h, the test plants were inoculated by spraying with an aqueous suspension of LEPTNO spores and kept in a dew chamber overnight.

Test compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) then dilutions in copper-minus and copper-plus media were prepared as 100 μL aliquots in flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates.

The plates were incubated at 25° C. for 72 h before assessing fungal growth by measuring light scattering in a NepheloStar plate reader. Growth inhibition was determined by comparing growth in the presence of test compound with growth in control wells lacking test compound.

Efficacy was determined based on percentage of disease control against tomato late blight (\nPhytophthora infestans\n), tomato early blight (\nAlternaria solani\n), and anthracnose on cucumbers (\nColletotrichum lagenarium\n). Treatments were arranged as a factorial experiment in a completely randomized design.

All treatments were performed in triplicate. Plant varieties used were Outdoor Girl and Bush Pickle, for tomato and cucumber, respectively. Treatments were prepared in 0.01% Triton® X-100 and applied to run-off 24 h before inoculation using a spin-table sprayer.

\nExample 38\n\n\nControl of Grape Downy Mildew (\nPlasmopara viticola\n) and Tomato Late Blight (\nPhytophthora infestans\n) by Compound 16, its Copper Complex, and Copper Chloride\n\n\n \n \n \nTest compounds were hydrazone Compound 16, the complex of Compound 16 with copper (“hydrazone-copper”) prepared by precipitation with CuCl\n2\n.2H\n2\nO using a 1:1 molar ratio, and CuCl\n2\n.2H\n2\nO alone. Hydrazone and hydrazone-copper were formulated in 10% acetone/0.1% Trycol 5941 in de-ionized water. CuCl\n2\n.2H\n2\nO was formulated with 0.1% Trycol 5941 in de-ionized water. Grape and tomato plants were sprayed with 160 μM suspensions of the formulated test compounds at a spray volume of 0.8 mL per plant. After 24 h, the undersides of the grape leaves were inoculated with an aqueous suspension of \nPlasmopara viticola \nsporangia and tomato plants were inoculated with an aqueous suspension of \nPhytophthora infestans \nsporangia. Plants were kept in high humidity overnight, then transferred to a greenhouse (grapes) or growth room (tomatoes) until disease developed on untreated control plants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults for disease control by hydrazone-copper were compared with predicted results calculated using the Colby formula based on disease control by the hydrazone alone and CuCl\n2 \nalone. Results, shown in Table 25, show that hydrazone-copper provided greater disease control than predicted based on control observed for hydrazone and CuCl\n2 \nalone.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% Control\n\n\n% Control\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisease\n\n\nTreatment\n\n\nμM\n\n\nObserved\n\n\nPredicted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDowny mildew\n\n\nHydrazone 16\n\n\n160\n\n\n29\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHydrazone-copper 600\n\n\n160\n\n\n78\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCuCl\n2\n \n\n\n160\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate blight\n\n\nHydrazone 16\n\n\n160\n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHydrazone-coppper 600\n\n\n160\n\n\n100\n\n\n84\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCuCl\n2\n \n\n\n160\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile this disclosure has been described as having exemplary compounds, the present disclosure can be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure.
