Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to pharmaceutical uses of mesembrenone and medicaments and dietary supplements containing mesembrenone.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe plants of the genus \nSceletium \nare known to contain indole alkaloids such as mesembrenol, mesembranol, mesembrine and mesembranone, the chemical formulae of which are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,288,104. U.S. Pat. No. 6,288,104 describes mesembrine, mesembrenol and mesembranone as having potent 5-HT uptake inhibitory activity and, thus, as being useful in treating conditions that respond to treatment with a serotonin-uptake inhibitor, such as mild to moderate depression. Mesembrine hydrochloride has previously been reported to be a weak PDE4 inhibitor (Napoletano, M. et al. 2001. Mesembrine is an inhibitor of PDE4 that follows the structure-activity relationship of rolipram. Chemistry Preprint Archive, Volume 2001, Issue 3, March 2001, Pages 303-308).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe applicant has surprisingly found that mesembrenone exhibits potent PDE-4 inhibition properties and, in addition to being useful in treating conditions that respond to treatment with a PDE-4 inhibitor, has dual activity on account of its serotonin-uptake inhibition properties.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the invention, there is provided the use of mesembrenone, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the manufacture of a medicament or dietary supplement for preventing or treating a condition that responds to treatment with a PDE-4 inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that mesembrenone may be utilized in either of its diastereoisomeric forms, or a mixture thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment of the invention, mesembrenone is extracted and isolated, for example as a pure compound, from plant material of the plant family Mesembryanthemaceae, preferably a plant or plants from the genus \nSceletium\n, more preferably, a plant or plants of the species \nSceletium tortuosum\n(L.) N.E.Br.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMesembrenone may also be synthesised by those skilled in the art according to known processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the invention, mesembrenone may be used in the form of an extract from plant material of the plant family Mesembryanthemaceae, preferably a plant from the genus \nSceletium\n, more preferably, a plant of the species \nSceletium tortuosum\n(L.)N.E.Br. The plant extract may be enriched in mesembrenone, according to methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, mesembrenone may be in the form of an isolated pure compound or plant extract. Mesembrenone may be used in free form or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, e.g. an acid addition salt, e.g. obtained by addition of an inorganic or organic acid, e.g. a hydrochloride acid addition salt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention there is also provided a method of preventing, alleviating or treating a mammal suffering from a condition which method includes administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof wherein said condition responds to the prevention, alleviation, modulation or treatment with a PDE-4 inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention, mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof has activity as a pharmaceutical, in particular as a modulator of PDE 4 enzyme activity, and may be used in the prevention and treatment of the following conditions, and included in pharmaceuticals and supplements for the prevention and treatment of the following conditions:\n\n\n \n \nRespiratory tract conditions: obstructive diseases of the airways including: asthma, including bronchial, allergic, intrinsic, extrinsic, exercise-induced, drug-induced (including aspirin and NS AID-induced) and dust-induced asthma, both intermittent and persistent and of all severities, and other causes of airway hyper-responsiveness;

including the prevention and treatment of metastatic disease and tumour recurrences, and paraneoplastic syndromes.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preferred indications are asthma, COPD, rhinitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, eczema, ulcerative colitis, Crohns Disease, Alzheimers disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinsons disease, disorders of cognition, learning, memory, anxiety and depression, and chronic pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also extends to a method of preventing or treating in a subject conditions that respond to treatment with simultaneous administration of a serotonin-uptake inhibitor and a PDE-4 inhibitor, comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as hereinbefore described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe novel and unexpected potent dual 5-HT uptake inhibition and PDE4 inhibition by mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof has a wide range of useful animal and human health applications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, on account of its 5-HT uptake inhibitory activity mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be used in the manufacture of a medicament having a dual 5-HT uptake inhibitory activity and PDE4 inhibitory activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, as a result of this dual activity the medicament may be used in treating or alleviating diseases or conditions such as e.g. arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis, autoimmune diseases, asthma, rhinitis, eczema, psoriasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimers Disease, neurodegenerative diseases, multiple sclerosis, psychotic states, deficits in learning, memory, cognition, anxiety, depression or eating disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further non-limiting example is the application of mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to conditions of the central and peripheral nervous system that respond to stimulating or increasing neurogenesis, since neuoregenesis is known to be enhanced either by a 5-HT uptake inhibitor or by a PDE4 inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConditions that can be beneficially treated by increasing or stimulating neurogenesis are known in the art (see for example U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 20020106731, 2005/0009742 and 2005/0009847, 20050032702, 2005/0031538, 2005/0004046, 2004/0254152, 2004/0229291, and 2004/0185429, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be useful in the treatment of diseases characterized by pain, addiction, and/or depression by directly replenishing, replacing, and/or supplementing neurons and/or glial cells and/or enhancing the growth and/or survival of existing neural cells, and/or slowing or reversing the loss of such cells in a neurodegenerative condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention there is provided a method of contacting a neural cell with mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in order to increase neurodifferentiation. The method may be used to stimulate a neural cell for proliferation, and thus neurogenesis, via one or more other agents used with mesembrenone in combination, or to maintain, stabilize, stimulate, or increase neurodifferentiation in a cell or tissue by use of mesembrenone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a method comprising contacting the cell or tissue with mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In some embodiments, the cell or tissue is in an animal subject or a human patient as described herein. Non-limiting examples include a human patient treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation, or other therapy or condition which is detrimental to cognitive function; or a human patient diagnosed as having epilepsy, a condition associated with epilepsy, or seizures associated with epilepsy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of mesembrenone may be before, after, or concurrent with another condition, or therapy.\n\n\n \nUses of Mesembrenone or a Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salt Thereof in Neurogenesis\n\n\n \n \n \nEmbodiments of a first aspect of the invention include a method of modulating neurogenesis by contacting one or more neural cells with mesembrenone. The amount of mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be selected to be effective to produce an improvement in a treated subject, or to allow for the detection of neurogenesis in vitro. In some embodiments, the amount is one that also minimizes clinical side effects or drug interactions seen with administration to a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being bound by theory, and offered to improve the understanding of the disclosure, phosphodiesterase inhibition is believed to promote neurogenesis by targeting second messenger systems downstream of neurotransmitters and other signaling molecules. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) are both examples of such second messengers, and inhibition of PDEs may prolong cAMP and cGMP signals and may increase signaling through neurogenic signal transduction pathways.\n\n\n \nCognitive Function\n\n\n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, and if compared to a reduced level of cognitive function, a method of the invention may be for enhancing or improving the reduced cognitive function or to maintain or stabilize the cognitive function in a subject or patient. The method may comprise administering mesembrenone to a subject or patient to enhance or improve a decline or decrease of cognitive function due to a therapy and/or condition that reduces cognitive function. In some embodiments, the maintenance or stabilization of cognitive function may be at a level, or thereabouts, present in a subject or patient in the absence of a therapy and/or condition that reduces cognitive function or as a result of a therapy and/or condition that reduces cognitive function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese methods optionally include assessing or measuring cognitive function of the subject or patient before, during, and/or after administration of the treatment to detect or determine the effect thereof on cognitive function. So in one embodiment, a methods may comprise i) treating a subject or patient that has been previously assessed for cognitive function and ii) reassessing cognitive function in the subject or patient during or after the course of treatment. The assessment may measure cognitive function for comparison to a control or standard value (or range) in subjects or patients in the absence of mesembrenone. This may be used to assess the efficacy of mesembrenone in alleviating the reduction in cognitive function.\n\n\n \nMood Disorders\n\n\n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, there is provided a method of treating a mood disorder in a subject or patient comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a subject or patient that is under treatment with a therapy and/or in a condition that results in a mood disorder. Non-limiting examples of mood disorders include depression, anxiety, hypomania, panic attacks, excessive elation, seasonal mood (or affective) disorder, schizophrenia and other psychoses, lissencephaly syndrome, anxiety syndromes, anxiety disorders, phobias, stress and related syndromes, aggression, non-senile dementia, post-pain depression, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \nIdentification of Subjects and Patients\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention includes methods comprising identification of an individual suffering from one or more disease, disorders, or conditions, or a symptom thereof, and administering to the subject or patient a therapeutically effective amount mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The identification of a subject or patient as having one or more diseases, disorders or conditions, or a symptom thereof, may be made by a skilled practitioner using any appropriate means known in the field.\n\n\n \nThe Subsequent Administration of Mesembrenone by the Identification or Diagnosis of a Subject or Patient in Need of One or More Effects Provided by Mesembrenone\n\n\n \n \n \nNon-limiting examples of an effect include neurogenic activity and/or potentiation of neurogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, identification of a patient in need of neurogenesis modulation comprises identifying a patient who has or will be exposed to a factor or condition known to inhibit neurogenesis, including but not limited to, stress, aging, sleep deprivation, hormonal changes (e.g., those associated with puberty, pregnancy, or aging (e.g., menopause), lack of exercise, lack of environmental stimuli (e.g., social isolation), diabetes and drugs of abuse (e.g., alcohol, especially chronic use; opiates and opioids; psychostimulants). In some cases, the patient has been identified as non-responsive to treatment with primary medications for the condition(s) targeted for treatment (e.g., non-responsive to antidepressants for the treatment of depression), and mesembrenone is administered in a method for enhancing the responsiveness of the patient to a co-existing or pre-existing treatment regimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn additional embodiments, the patient in need of neurogenesis modulation suffers from premenstrual syndrome, post-partum depression, or pregnancy-related fatigue and/or depression, and the treatment comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of mesembrenone. Without being bound by any particular theory, and offered to improve understanding of the invention, it is believed that levels of steroid hormones, such as estrogen, are increased during the menstrual cycle during and following pregnancy, and that such hormones can exert a modulatory effect on neurogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the patient is a user of a recreational drug including but not limited to alcohol, amphetamines, PCP, cocaine, and opiates. Without being bound by any particular theory, and offered to improve understanding of the invention, it is believed that some drugs of abuse have a modulatory effect on neurogenesis, which is associated with depression, anxiety and other mood disorders, as well as deficits in cognition, learning, and memory. Moreover, mood disorders are causative and/or risk factors for substance abuse, and substance abuse (as self-medication) is a common behavioral symptom of mood disorders. Thus, substance abuse and mood disorders may reinforce each other, rendering patients suffering from both conditions non-responsive to treatment. Thus, in some embodiments, mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be used to treat patients suffering from substance abuse and/or mood disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further embodiments, the patient is on a co-existing and/or pre-existing treatment regimen involving administration of one or more prescription medications having a modulatory effect on neurogenesis. For example, in some embodiments, the patient suffers from chronic pain and is prescribed one or more opiate/opioid medications; and/or suffers from ADD, ADHD, or a related disorder, and is prescribed a psychostimulant, such as ritalin, dexedrine, adderall, or a similar medication which inhibits neurogenesis. Without being bound by any particular theory, and offered to improve understanding of the invention, it is believed that such medications can exert a modulatory effect on neurogenesis, leading to depression, anxiety and other mood disorders, as well as deficits in cognition, learning, and memory. Thus, in some preferred embodiments, mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered to a patient who is currently or has recently been prescribed a medication that exerts a modulatory effect on neurogenesis, in order to treat depression, anxiety, and/or other mood disorders, and/or to improve cognition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn additional embodiments, the patient suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome; a sleep disorder; lack of exercise (e.g., elderly, infirm, or physically handicapped patients); and/or lack of environmental stimuli (e.g., social isolation); and the treatment comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn more embodiments, the patient is an individual having, or who is likely to develop, a disorder relating to neural degeneration, neural damage and/or neural demyelination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further embodiments, a subject or patient includes human beings and animals in assays for behavior linked to neurogenesis. Exemplary human and animal assays are known to the skilled person in the field.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet additional embodiments, identifying a patient in need of neurogenesis modulation comprises selecting a population or sub-population of patients, or an individual patient, that is more amenable to treatment and/or less susceptible to side effects than other patients having the same disease or condition. In some embodiments, identifying a patient amenable to treatment with mesembrenone comprises identifying a patient who has been exposed to a factor known to enhance neurogenesis, including but not limited to, exercise, hormones or other endogenous factors, and drugs taken as part of a pre-existing treatment regimen. In some embodiments, a sub-population of patients is identified as being more amenable to neurogenesis modulation with mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof by taking a cell or tissue sample from prospective patients, isolating and culturing neural cells from the sample, and determining the effect of the compound on the degree or nature of neurogenesis of the cells, thereby allowing selection of patients for which the therapeutic agent has a substantial effect on neurogenesis. Advantageously, the selection of a patient or population of patients in need of or amenable to treatment with mesembrenone according to the invention allows more effective treatment of the disease or condition targeted for treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the patient has suffered a CNS insult, such as a CNS lesion, a seizure (e.g., electroconvulsive seizure treatment; epileptic seizures), radiation, chemotherapy and/or stroke or other ischemic injury. Without being bound by any particular theory, and offered to improve understanding of the invention, it is believed that some CNS insults/injuries leads to increased proliferation of neural stem cells, but that the resulting neural cells form aberrant connections which can lead to impaired CNS function and/or diseases, such as temporal lobe epilepsy. According to the invention, a therapeutically effective amount of mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered to a patient who has suffered, or is at risk of suffering, a CNS insult or injury to stimulate neurogenesis. Advantageously, stimulation of the differentiation of neural stem cells with mesembrenone, optionally in combination with one or more other neurogenic agents, activates signalling pathways necessary for progenitor cells to effectively migrate and incorporate into existing neural networks or to block inappropriate proliferation.\n\n\n \nOpiate or Opioid Based Analgesic\n\n\n \n \n \nAdditionally, the invention provides for the application of mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to treat a subject or patient for a condition due to the anti-neurogenic effects of an opiate or opioid based analgesic. In some embodiments, the administration of an opiate or opioid based analgesic, such as an opiate like morphine or other opioid receptor agonists, to a subject or patient, results in a decrease in, or inhibition of, neurogenesis. The administration of mesembrenone with an opiate or opioid based analgesic would reduce the anti-neurogenic effect. One non-limiting example is administration of such a combination with an opioid receptor agonist after surgery (such as for treating post-operative pain).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly there is provided a method of treating post operative pain in a subject or patient by combining administration of an opiate or opioid based analgesic with mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther embodiments include a method to treat or prevent decreases in, or inhibition of, neurogenesis in other cases involving use of an opioid receptor agonist, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as described herein. Non-limiting examples include cases involving an opioid receptor agonist, which decreases or inhibits neurogenesis, and drug addiction, drug rehabilitation, and/or prevention of relapse into addiction. In some embodiments, the opioid receptor agonist is morphine, opium or another opiate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further embodiments, the invention includes a method to treat a cell, tissue, or subject which is exhibiting decreased neurogenesis or increased neurodegeneration. In some cases, the cell, tissue, or subject is, or has been, subjected to, or contacted with, an agent that decreases or inhibits neurogenesis. One non-limiting example is a human subject that has been administered morphine or other agent which decreases or inhibits neurogenesis. Non-limiting examples of other agents include opiates and opioid receptor agonists, such as mu receptor subtype agonists, that inhibit or decrease neurogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus in additional embodiments, the methods may be used to treat subjects having, or diagnosed with, depression or other withdrawal symptoms from morphine or other agents which decrease or inhibit neurogenesis. This is distinct from the treatment of subjects having, or diagnosed with, depression independent of an opiate, such as that of a psychiatric nature, as disclosed herein. In further embodiments, the method may be used to treat a subject with one or more chemical addictions or dependencies, such as with morphine or other opiates, where the addiction or dependency is ameliorated or alleviated by an increase in neurogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be such that it results in a measurable relief of a disease condition like those described herein. As a non-limiting example, an improvement in the Hamilton depression scale (HAM-D) score for depression may be used to determine (such as quantitatively) or detect (such as qualitatively) a measurable level of improvement in the depression of a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-limiting examples of symptoms that may be treated according to the invention herein include abnormal behavior, abnormal movement, hyperactivity, hallucinations, acute delusions, combativeness, hostility, negativism, withdrawal, seclusion, memory defects, sensory defects, cognitive defects, and tension. Non-limiting examples of abnormal behavior include irritability, poor impulse control, distractibility, and aggressiveness. Outcomes from treatment according to the invention include improvements in cognitive function or capability in comparison to the absence of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional examples of diseases and conditions treatable by the method according to the invention include, but are not limited to, neurodegenerative disorders and neural disease, such as dementias (e.g., senile dementia, memory disturbances/memory loss, dementias caused by neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease or disorders, Huntington's disease (Huntington's Chorea), Lou Gehrig's disease, multiple sclerosis, Pick's disease, Parkinsonism dementia syndrome), progressive subcortical gliosis, progressive supranuclear palsy, thalmic degeneration syndrome, hereditary aphasia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Shy-Drager syndrome, and Lewy body disease; vascular conditions (e.g., infarcts, hemorrhage, cardiac disorders); mixed vascular and Alzheimer's; bacterial meningitis; Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease; and Cushing's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disclosed embodiments also provide for the treatment of a nervous system disorder related to neural damage, cellular degeneration, a psychiatric condition, cellular (neurological) trauma and/or injury (e.g., subdural hematoma or traumatic brain injury), toxic chemicals (e.g., heavy metals, alcohol, some medications), CNS hypoxia, or other neurologically related conditions. In practice, the disclosed methods may be applied to a subject or patient afflicted with, or diagnosed with, one or more central or peripheral nervous system disorders in any combination. Diagnosis may be performed by a skilled person in the applicable fields using known and routine methodologies which identify and/or distinguish these nervous system disorders from other conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-limiting examples of nervous system disorders related to cellular degeneration include neurodegenerative disorders, neural stem cell disorders, neural progenitor cell disorders, degenerative diseases of the retina, and ischemic disorders. In some embodiments, an ischemic disorder comprises an insufficiency, or lack, of oxygen or angiogenesis, and non-limiting example include spinal ischemia, ischemic stroke, cerebral infarction, multi-infarct dementia. While these conditions may be present individually in a subject or patient, the disclosed methods also provide for the treatment of a subject or patient afflicted with, or diagnosed with, more than one of these conditions in any combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-limiting embodiments of nervous system disorders related to a psychiatric condition include neuropsychiatric disorders and affective disorders. As used herein, an affective disorder refers to a disorder of mood such as, but not limited to, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hypomania, panic attacks, excessive elation, bipolar depression, bipolar disorder (maniac-depression), and seasonal mood (or affective) disorder. Other non-limiting embodiments include schizophrenia and other psychoses, lissencephaly syndrome, anxiety syndromes, anxiety disorders, phobias, stress and related syndromes (e.g., panic disorder, phobias, adjustment disorders, migraines), cognitive function disorders, aggression, drug and alcohol abuse, drug addiction, and drug-induced neurological damage, obsessive compulsive behavior syndromes, borderline personality disorder, non-senile dementia, post-pain depression, post-partum depression, and cerebral palsy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of nervous system disorders related to cellular or tissue trauma and/or injury include, but are not limited to, neurological traumas and injuries, surgery related trauma and/or injury, retinal injury and trauma, injury related to epilepsy, cord injury, spinal cord injury, brain injury, brain surgery, trauma related brain injury, trauma related to spinal cord injury, brain injury related to cancer treatment, spinal cord injury related to cancer treatment, brain injury related to infection, brain injury related to inflammation, spinal cord injury related to infection, spinal cord injury related to inflammation, brain injury related to environmental toxin, and spinal cord injury related to environmental toxin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-limiting examples of nervous system disorders related to other neurologically related conditions include learning disorders, memory disorders, age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) or age-related memory loss, autism, learning or attention deficit disorders (ADD or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD), narcolepsy, sleep disorders and sleep deprivation (e.g., insomnia, chronic fatigue syndrome), cognitive disorders, epilepsy, injury related to epilepsy, and temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther non-limiting examples of diseases and conditions treatable by a method of the invention includes, but is not limited to, hormonal changes (e.g., depression and other mood disorders associated with puberty, pregnancy, or aging (e.g., menopause)); and lack of exercise (e.g., depression or other mental disorders in elderly, paralyzed, or physically handicapped patients); infections (e.g., HIV); genetic abnormalities (down syndrome); metabolic abnormalities (e.g., vitamin B12 or folate deficiency); hydrocephalus; memory loss separate from dementia, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), age-related cognitive decline, and memory loss resulting from the use of general anesthetics, chemotherapy, radiation treatment, post-surgical trauma, or therapeutic intervention; and diseases of the of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), including but not limited to, PNS neuropathies (e.g., vascular neuropathies, diabetic neuropathies, amyloid neuropathies, and the like), neuralgias, neoplasms, myelin-related diseases, etc and the treatment of, or supportive management of, subjective stress in healthy individuals\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe advantages of a dual PDE4 and 5-HT uptake inhibition mechanisms of action include the possibility of using a lower dose to achieve the same therapeutic objective in conditions that respond to both a 5-HT uptake inhibitor, as well as a PDE4 inhibitor, such as conditions that modulate neurogenesis. The use of lower doses of the dual acting mesembrenone can be expected to have a reduced side-effect profile than single-action pharmaceuticals or medicaments, such as a reduction in the loss of libido commonly found with in 5-HT uptake inhibitors; and a reduction in the nausea and vomiting found with PDE4 inhibitors. The dual action of the pharmaceutical or medicament can be an advantage by reducing the number of medications that have to be taken where there is a relevant co-morbidity. For example arthritis together with depression, Alzheimers together with depression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the above uses, the required dosage will of course vary depending on the mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired. An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal, e.g. humans, is in the range from about 5 micrograms to 5 milligrams mesembrenone, preferably from 20 micrograms to 200 micrograms mesembrenone, conveniently administered for example in divided doses up to four times a day or in slow release form. Suitable unit dosage forms comprise from about 5 micrograms to 500 micrograms, preferably 20 micrograms to 100 micrograms of mesembrenone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMesembrenone may be administered in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, e.g. as indicated above. Such salts may be prepared by conventional manner and exhibit the same order of activity as mesembrenone in free form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be formulated in the form of a pharmaceutical composition according to a method known in the art, e.g. by mixing with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be administered by any conventional route, in particular enterally, e.g. orally, e.g. in the form of aqueous-ethanolic tinctures, tablets, capsules, softgels, oral sprays, gums, wafers or a sub-lingual preparations, nasally, e.g. in the form of nasal sprays or inhalers, or transdermally, e.g. in the form of skin patches, lotions, creams, and ointments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the foregoing, the present invention further provides:\n\n \n \n \n \n \na) the use of mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as a PDE4 modulator or inhibitor or as a dual PDE4 and 5-HT uptake inhibitor, e.g. in any of the particular indications hereinbefore set forth; or\n \nb) the use of mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the manufacture of a medicament, for the treatment or inhibition or prevention of any of the indications hereinbefore set forth, including, but not limited to, the treatment of conditions of the central and peripheral nervous system that respond to stimulating or increasing neurogenesis; or\n \nc) a pharmaceutical composition, for use in any of the indications hereinbefore set forth, comprising mesembrenone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents or carriers therefore; or\n \nd) a method of preventing, alleviating, treating, modulating, improving, stabilizing, enhancing a disorder, a condition or a disease as disclosed hereinbefore.\n \n \n \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention is now described according to the following non-limiting examples and methods and with reference to the following diagrammatic drawings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the drawings:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n represents the concentration—response curve of mesembrine on both the 5-HT transporter and PDE-4B enzyme at different concentrations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n represents the concentration—response curve of mesembrenone on both the 5-HT transporter and PDE-4B enzyme at different concentrations.\n\n\n \nIsolation of Mesembrenone\n\n\n \n \n \nThe aerial parts of \nS. tortuosum \nwere dried and pulverized. The material was submerged in distilled water and acidified by adding 4% H\n2\nSO\n4\n. To this \nwater phase\n 20% NH\n4\nOH was added to basify the solution followed by excessive extraction with dichloromethane. This crude alkaloid extract was adsorbed on silica gel and loaded on a silica gel \n60\nF column eluting with 100% CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nand thereafter with CH\n2\nCl\n2\n/EtOAc (8:2) with increasing polarity to CH\n2\nCl\n2\n/EtOAc/MeOH (7:2:1). 35 serial 100 mL eluted fractions were collected and the purity assessed for each fraction using thin layer chromatography. The purest fractions were then selected, and GC-MS used (Agilent 6890N GC equipped with a HP-\n5MS\n 5% phenyl methyl siloxane column (30 m×250 μm i.d.×0.25 μm capillary column)) to identity mesembrenone according to the published fragmentation pattern. Fractions rich in mesembrenone were pooled, and re-adsorbed on silica gel. The pooled sample was then fractionated on a silica gel \n60\nF column eluting with CH\n2\nCl\n2\n/EtOAc (8:2). The purity of the pooled fraction was followed on GC-MS (Agilent 6890N GC) equipped with a HP-\n5MS\n 5% phenyl methyl siloxane column (30 m×250 μm i.d.×0.25 μm capillary column). The oven temperature program: 60° C., rising to 255° C. at a rate of 20° C./min and held for 15 min. Helium was used as carrier gas. Spectra obtained on electron impact at 70 eV, scanning from 35 to 550 m/z. Under these conditions mesembrenone had a rt of 18.8 min, and a sample isolated. The structure of the sample was confirmed as mesembrenone using NMR.\n\n\n \nUse of Mesembrenone\n\n\n \n \n \nA sample of pure mesembrenone isolated from \nSceletium \nplant material as discussed above is tested in binding studies at a range of concentrations in-vitro for 5-HT transporter inhibitory activity (i.e. serotonin-uptake inhibition), and at a range of concentrations in-vitro for PDE-4B enzyme inhibitory activity.

Thus mesembrenone can be regarded as being a “dual-acting” inhibitor, simultaneously acting as a 5-HT transporter inhibitor as well as a PDE4 inhibitor. By comparison mesembrine is highly selective for the inhibition of the 5-HT transporter relative to the inhibition of PDE4B."
