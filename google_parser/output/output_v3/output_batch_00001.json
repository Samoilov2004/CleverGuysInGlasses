Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n1. TECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel compounds which modulate the CB2 receptor and their use as medicaments.\n\n\n \n2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\n\n \n \n \nCannabinoids are a group of about 60 distinct compounds found in \nCannabis sativa\n (also know as marijuana) with cannabinol, cannabidiol and Δ\n9\n-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) being the most representative molecules. The therapeutic usage of \nCannabis\n can be dated back to ancient dynasties of China and includes applications for various illnesses ranging from lack of appetite, emesis, cramps, menstrual pain, spasticity to rheumatism. The long history of \nCannabis\n use has led to the development of several pharmaceutical drugs. For example, Marinol and Cesamet which are based on THC and its analogous nabilone, respectively, are used as anti-emetic and appetite stimulant. Despite of the clinical benefits, the therapeutic usage of cannabis is limited by its psychoactive effects including hallucination, addiction and dependence. \nMechoulam R, ed. Cannabinoids as Therapeutic Agents, Boca Raton, FL; CRC Press, 1986\n provides a review of the medicinal use of cannabis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe physiological effects of cannabinoids are mediated by at least two G-protein coupled receptors, CB 1 and CB2. Autoradiographic studies have demonstrated that CB 1 receptors are expressed primarily in the central nervous system, specifically in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia and cerebellum. They are also found to a lesser degree in the reproductive system and other peripheral tissues including that of the immune system. CB1 receptors regulate the release of neurotransmitters from the pre-synaptic neurons and are believed to mediate most of the euphoric and other central nervous system effects of cannabis, such as THC-induced ring-catalepsy, hypomobility, and hypothermia, which were found to be completely absent in mice with a deletion of the CB1 gene (\nZimmer et al., Increased mortality, hypoactivity, and hypoalgesia in cannabinoid CB 1 receptor knockout mice. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. (1999) 96:5780-5785\n.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCB2 receptors are almost exclusively found in the immune system, with the greatest density in the spleen. It is estimated that the expression level of CB2 in the immune cells is about 10 to 100 times higher than CB1. Within the immune system, CB2 is found in various cell types, includung B cells, NK cells, monocytes, microglial cells, neutrophils, T cells, dentritic cells and mast cells, suggesting that a wide range of immune functions can be regulated through CB2 modulators (\nKlein et al., The cannabinoid system and immune system. J Leukoc Biol (2003) 74:.486-496\n). This is supported by the finding that the immunomodulatory effect of THC is absent in CB2 deficient mice mice (\nBicklet et al., Immunomodulation by cannabinoid is absent in mice deficient for the cannabinoid CB2 receptor. Eur J Pharmacol (2000) 396:141-149\n). CB2 selective ligands have been developed and tested for their effects in various imflammatory settings. For example, in animal models of inflammation, CB2 selective agonists, inverse agonists and antagonists have been shown to be effective in suppressing inflammation (\nHanus et al., HU-308: a specific agonist for CB(2), a peripheral cannabinoid receptor. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. (1999) 96:14228-14233\n, \nUeda et al., Involvement of cannabinoid CB(2) receptor-mediated response and efficacy of cannabinoid CB(2) receptor inverse agonist, JTE-907, in cutaneous inflammation in mice. Eur J Pharmacol. (2005) 520:164-171\n and \nSmith et al., The anti-inflammatory activities of cannabinoid receptor ligands in mouse peritonitis models Eur J Pharmacol. (2001) 432:107-119\n.). Furthermore, CB2 selective agonists inhibit disease severity and spasticity in animal models for multiple sclerosis (\nBaker et al., Cannabinoids control spasticity and tremor in a multiple sclerosis model. Nature (2000) 404:84-87\n.\nArevalo-Martin et al., Therapeutic action of cannabinoids in a murine model of multiple sclerosis J Neurosci. (2003) 23:2511-2516\n.). Taken together, these results support the notion that CB2 receptor modulators can be employed for the treatment of medical conditions having an inflammatory component.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to inflammation, CB2 agonists have been shown to inhibit pain and emesis. For instance, CB2 selective agonists blunt the pain response induced by thermal or other stimuli (\nMalan et al., CB2 cannabinoid receptor-mediated peripheral antinociception. Pain. (2001) 93:239-45\n and \nNackley et al., Selective activation of cannabinoid CB(2) receptors suppresses spinal fos protein expression and pain behavior in a rat model of inflammation. Neuroscience (2003) 119:747-57\n.) CB2 activation has also been demonstrated to inhibit neuropathic pain response (\nIbrahim et al., Activation of CB2 cannabinoid receptors by AM1241 inhibits experimental neuropathic pain: pain inhibition by receptors not present in the CNS. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. (2003) 100:10529-33\n.) Finally, in contrast to the earlier data which did not find CB2 in the brain, a recent article demonstrated the expression of CB2 in the brain, at about 1.5 % of the level in the spleen. CB2 activation is shown by this article to be responsible for the anti-emetic effect of endocannabinoid (\nVan Sickle et al., Identification and functional characterization of brainstem cannabinoid CB2 receptors. Science. 2005 310:329-332\n.) The foregoing results confirm that CB2 agonists can be used for the treatment of inflammatory and neuropathic pain as well as emesis.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel compounds which bind to and modulate the CB2 receptor. The invention also provides a method and pharmaceutical compositions for treating inflammation by way of the administration of therapeutic amounts of these compounds. Lastly, the invention provides a method and pharmaceutical compositions for treating pain by way of the administration of therapeutic amounts of the new compounds which are CB2 agonists.\n\n\n

Human CB1 and CB2 Receptor Binding-:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nExperimental Method:\n\n \n \n \nCB2 membranes were purchased and made from HEK293 EBNA cells stably transfected with human CB2 receptor cDNA (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences). CB1 membranes were isolated from HEK cells stably co-transfected with human CB1 receptor and Gα16 cDNA's.\n \nThe membrane preparation was bound to scintillation beads (Ysi-Poly-L-lysine SPA beads, GE Healthcare) for 4 hours at room temperature in assay buffer containing 50mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5mM EDTA, 5mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.8% fatty acid free Bovine Serum Albumin. Unbound membrane was removed by washing in assay buffer. Membrane-bead mixture was added to 96-well assay plates in the amounts of 15ug membrane per well (CB2) or 2.5ug per well (CB 1) and 1mg SPA bead per well. Compounds were added to the membrane-bead mixture in dose-response concentrations ranging from 1x10\n-5\n M to 1x10\n-10\n M with 0.25% DMSO, final. The competition reaction was initiated with the addition of \n3\nH-CP55940 (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences) at a final concentration of 1.5nM (CB2) or 2.5nM (CB1). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 18hours and read on TopCount NXT plate reader. Total and non-specific binding was determined in the absence and presence of 1.25uM Win 55212 (Sigma). IC50 values for each compound were calculated as the concentration of compound that inhibits the specific binding of the radioactively labeled ligand to the receptor by 50% using the XLFit 4.1 four parameter logistic model.

CB2R mediated modulation of cAMP synthesis:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention were evaluated for their CB2 agonist or inverse agonistic activity in accordance with the following experimental method. Compounds which were shown to bind to CB2 by the binding assay described above but which were not shown to exhibit CB2R-mediated modulation of cAMP synthesis by this assay were presumed to be CB2 antagonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExperimental Method:\n\n \n \n \nCHO cells expressing human CB2R (Euroscreen) were plated at a density of 5000 cells per well in 384 well plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. After removing the media, the cells were treated with test compounds diluted in stimulation buffer containing 1mM IBMX, 0.25% BSA and 10uM Forskolin. The assay was incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. Cells were lysed and the cAMP concentration was measured using DiscoverX -XS cAMP kit, following the manufacturer's protocol. In this setting, agonists will decrease forskolin induced production of cAMP while inverse agonists will further increase forskolin induced production of cAMP. EC50 of agonists were calculated as follows. The maximal amount of cAMP produced by forskolin compared to the level of cAMP inhibited by 1uM CP55940 is defined as 100%. The EC50 value of each test compound was determined as the concentration at which 50% of the forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis was inhibited. Data was analyzed using a four-parameter logistic model. (Model 205 of XLfit 4.0).\n \n\n\n\n\nC.
