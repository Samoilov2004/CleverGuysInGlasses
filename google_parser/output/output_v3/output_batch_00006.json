No. 60/977,159 entitled “Linear and Cyclic Melanocortin Receptor-Specific Peptidomimetics”, filed on Oct. 3, 2007, and the specification and claims thereof are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n1. Field of the Invention (Technical Field)\n\n\nThe present invention provides linear and cyclic peptidomimetics that are specific for one or more melanocortin receptors, and which may be used in the treatment of a wide variety of diseases, syndromes and conditions.\n\n\n2. Background Art\n\n\nMelanocortin Receptors. A family of melanocortin receptor types and subtypes have been identified, including melanocortin-1 receptors (MC1-R) expressed on normal human melanocytes and melanoma cells, melanocortin-2 receptors (MC2-R) for ACTH (adrenocorticotropin) expressed in cells of the adrenal gland, melanocortin-3 and melanocortin-4 receptors (MC3-R and MC4-R) expressed primarily in cells in the hypothalamus, mid-brain and brainstem, and melanocortin-5 receptors (MC5-R), expressed in a wide distribution of central nervous system and peripheral tissues.\n\n\nA wide variety of diseases, conditions and syndromes have been identified for which compounds specific for one or more melanocortin receptors may have utility. For example, compounds that are specific for MC1-R, particularly agonists, may be useful as tanning agents by increasing melanin production. Compounds specific for MCR-1 and MCR-3 may be useful in regulation of inflammatory processes. Compounds specific for MC3-R or MC4-R are believed to be useful in regulation of energy homeostasis, including use as agents for attenuating food intake and body weight gain, for use in treatment of anorexia, as a weight gain aid, for treatment of obesity, and treatment of other food intake and metabolism-related purposes. Compounds specific for MC3-R and MC4-R can further be used as agents for treatment of sexual dysfunction, including male erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction. Compounds specific for MC4-R can further be used as agents for treatment of alcohol abuse, anxiety and related conditions.\n\n\nBoth peptide and small molecule melanocortin receptor-specific compounds have been developed and explored for treatment of certain of the foregoing and other conditions. However, to date no melanocortin receptor-specific compound has been approved for any clinical indication, and very few have been tested in human clinical trials.\n\n\nIn general, melanocortin receptor-specific peptides have limitations associated with peptide-based drugs. These include enzymatic degradation, short circulation half life, limited bioavailability, inadequate efficacy, short duration of effect, limitations on routes of administration and the like. Thus there remains a significant need for compounds with the favorable characteristics of peptides, such as high specificity for discrete melanocortin receptors, partial or full agonists, partial or full antagonists, mixed agonist-antagonists, inverse agonists, or antagonists of inverse agonists, but with improved resistance to enzymatic degradation, or improved circulation half life, or improve bioavailability, or improved efficacy, or other advantageous characteristics. It is against this background that the present invention was made.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nDisclosure of the Invention\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides a peptidomimetic of the formula\n\n\nT\n1\n-Xaa\n1\n-Xaa\n2\n-Xaa\n3\n-Xaa\n4\n-Xaa\n5\n-Xaa\n6\n-Xaa\n7\n-Xaa\n8\n-T\n2 \n\n\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein:\n\n\n\nT\n1 \nis H or an N-terminal group;\n\n\nXaa\n1 \nis optionally present, and if present, is an amino acid with a side chain including at least one primary amine, guanidine, urea, alkyl or cycloalkyl, or Xaa\n1 \nis an amino acid surrogate of the structure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein the solid lines indicate a bond;

A “manufactured” peptide includes a peptide produced by chemical synthesis, recombinant DNA technology, biochemical or enzymatic fragmentation of larger molecules, combinations of the foregoing or, in general, made by any other method.\n\n\n“Peptidomimetic”\n\n\nThe term “peptidomimetic” as used throughout the specification and claims is intended to include any structure comprised of two or more amino acids, including chemical modifications and derivatives of amino acids and at least one “surrogate” as hereafter defined. The amino acids forming all or a part of a peptidomimetic may be naturally occurring amino acids, stereoisomers and modifications of such amino acids, non-protein amino acids, post-translationally modified amino acids, enzymatically modified amino acids, and the like. The term “peptidomimetic” also includes dimers or multimers of peptidomimetic. A “manufactured” peptidomimetic includes a peptidomimetic produced by chemical synthesis, recombinant DNA technology, biochemical or enzymatic fragmentation of larger molecules, combinations of the foregoing or, in general, made by any other method.\n\n\n“Amino Acid Side Chain Moiety”\n\n\nThe term “amino acid side chain moiety” used in this invention, including as used in the specification and claims, includes any side chain of any amino acid, as the term “amino acid” is defined herein. This thus includes the side chain moiety present in naturally occurring amino acids. It further includes side chain moieties in modified naturally occurring amino acids, such as glycosylated amino acids. It further includes side chain moieties in stereoisomers and modifications of naturally occurring protein amino acids, non-protein amino acids, post-translationally modified amino acids, enzymatically synthesized amino acids, derivatized amino acids, constructs or structures designed to mimic amino acids, and the like. For example, the side chain moiety of any amino acid disclosed herein is included within the definition. A “derivative of an amino acid side chain moiety” as hereafter defined is included within the definition of an amino acid side chain moiety.\n\n\n“Derivative of an Amino Acid Side Chain Moiety”\n\n\nA “derivative of an amino acid side chain moiety” is a modification to or variation in any amino acid side chain moiety, including a modification to or variation in either a naturally occurring or unnatural amino acid side chain moiety, wherein the modification or variation includes: (a) adding one or more saturated or unsaturated carbon atoms to an existing alkyl, aryl, or aralkyl chain; (b) substituting a carbon in the side chain with another atom, preferably oxygen or nitrogen; (c) adding a terminal group to a carbon atom of the side chain, including methyl (—CH\n3\n), methoxy (—OCH\n3\n), nitro (—NO\n2\n), hydroxyl (—OH), or cyano (—C≡N); (d) for side chain moieties including a hydroxy, thio or amino groups, adding a suitable hydroxy, thio or amino protecting group; or (e) for side chain moieties including a ring structure, adding one or more ring substituents, including hydroxyl, halogen, alkyl, or aryl groups attached directly or through an ether linkage. For amino groups, suitable amino protecting groups include, but are not limited to, Z, Fmoc, Boc, Pbf, Pmc and the like.\n\n\n“Amino Acids”\n\n\nThe “amino acids” used in embodiments of the present invention, and the term as used in the specification and claims, include the known naturally occurring protein amino acids, which are referred to by both their common three letter abbreviation and single letter abbreviation. See generally \nSynthetic Peptides: A User's Guide\n, G. A. Grant, editor, W.H. Freeman & Co., New York (1992), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference, including the text and table set forth at pages 11 through 24. An “amino acid” includes conventional α-amino acids and further includes both β-amino acids and α,α-disubstituted amino acids wherein at least one side chain is an amino acid side chain moiety as defined herein. An “amino acid” further includes N-alkyl α-amino acids, wherein the N-terminus amino group has a C\n1 \nto C\n6 \nlinear or branched alkyl substituent. It may thus be seen that the term “amino acid” includes stereoisomers and modifications of naturally occurring protein amino acids, non-protein amino acids, post-translationally modified amino acids, enzymatically synthesized amino acids, derivatized amino acids, constructs or structures designed to mimic amino acids, and the like.

Thus, “Nle” is norleucine; “Asp” is aspartic acid; “His” is histidine; “Arg” is arginine; “Trp” is tryptophan; “Lys” is lysine; “Gly” is glycine; “Pro” is proline; “Tyr” is tyrosine, “Ser” is serine and so on. All residues are in the L-isomer configuration unless the D-isomer is specified, as in “D-Ala” for D-alanine.\n\n\nA single amino acid, including stereoisomers and modifications of naturally occurring protein amino acids, non-protein amino acids, post-translationally modified amino acids, enzymatically synthesized amino acids, derivatized amino acids, an α,α-disubstituted amino acid derived from any of the foregoing (i.e., an α,α-disubstituted amino acid wherein at least one side chain is the same as that of the residue from which it is derived), a β-amino acid derived from any of the foregoing (i.e., a β-amino acid which other than for the presence of a β-carbon is otherwise the same as the residue from which it is derived) and the like, including all of the foregoing, is sometimes referred to herein as a “residue.”\n\n\n“α,α-Disubstituted Amino Acid”\n\n\nAn “α,α-disubstituted amino acid” means any α-amino acid having a further substituent in the α-position, which substituent may be the same as or different from the side chain moiety of the α-amino acid. Suitable substituents, in addition to the side chain moiety of the α-amino acid, include C\n1 \nto C\n6 \nlinear or branched alkyl. Aib is an example of an α,α-disubstituted amino acid. While α,α-disubstituted amino acids can be referred to using conventional L- and D-isomeric references, it is to be understood that such references are for convenience, and that where the substituents at the α-position are different, such amino acid can interchangeably be referred to as an α,α-disubstituted amino acid derived from the L- or D-isomer, as appropriate, of a residue with the designated amino acid side chain moiety. Thus (S)-2-Amino-2-methyl-hexanoic acid can be referred to as either an α,α-disubstituted amino acid derived from L-Nle or as an α,α-disubstituted amino acid derived from D-Ala. Similarly, Aib can be referred to as an α,α-disubstituted amino acid derived from Ala. Whenever an α,α-disubstituted amino acid is provided, it is to be understood as including all (R) and (S) configurations thereof.\n\n\n“N-Substituted Amino Acid”\n\n\nAn “N-substituted amino acid” means any amino acid wherein an amino acid side chain moiety, including without limitation an alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group, is covalently bonded to the backbone amino group, including optionally where there are no substituents other than H in the α-carbon position. Sarcosine is an example of an N-substituted amino acid. By way of example, sarcosine can be referred to as an N-substituted amino acid derivative of Ala, in that the amino acid side chain moiety of sarcosine and Ala is the same, methyl. Similarly, MePhe is N-methyl phenylalanine.\n\n\n“C-Terminus Group”\n\n\nThe term “C-terminus group” means any terminal group attached through the terminal ring carbon atom of a surrogate or terminal carbon atom of a residue or surrogate of the C-terminus of a peptidomimetic. The terminal ring carbon atom or terminal carbon atom may form a part of a residue or may form a part of a surrogate. In one aspect, the C-terminus group forms a part of an amino acid surrogate which is at the C-terminus position of the peptidomimetic. In another aspect, the C-terminus group forms a part of an amino acid residue which is at the C-terminus position of the peptidomimetic. The C-terminus group includes, but is not limited to,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—OH,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—C(═O)—OH,\n\n\n(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—OH,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—C(═O)—N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n),\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—C(═O)—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n),\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—O—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—CH\n3\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—C(═O)—NH—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—CH\n3\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—C(═O)—NH—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n),\n\n\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—C(═O)—N—((CH\n2\n)\nr\n—N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n))\n2\n,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—C(═O)—NH—CH(—C(═O)—OH)—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n),\n\n\n—C(═O)—NH—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—NH—C(═O)—CH(N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n))((CH\n2\n)\nr\n—N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n)), or\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—C(═O)—NH—CH(—C(═O)—NH\n2\n)—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—N(v\n1\n)(v\n2\n),\n\n\nincluding all (R) or (S) configurations of the foregoing, where v\n1 \nand v\n2 \nare each independently H, a C\n1 \nto C\n17 \nlinear or branched alkyl chain, r is 0 to 17 and n is 0 to 2; or any omega amino aliphatic, terminal aryl or aralkyl, including groups such as methyl, dimethyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, hexyl, allyl, cyclopropane methyl, hexanoyl, heptanoyl, acetyl, propionoyl, butanoyl, phenylacetyl, cyclohexylacetyl, naphthylacetyl, cinnamoyl, phenyl, benzyl, benzoyl, 12-Ado, 7′-amino heptanoyl, 6-Ahx, Amc or 8-Aoc, or any single natural or unnatural α-amino acid, β-amino acid or α,α-disubstituted amino acid, including all (R) or (S) configurations of the foregoing, optionally in combination with any of the foregoing non-amino acid groups.\n\n\n“N-Terminus Group”\n\n\nThe term “N-terminus group” means any terminal group attached through the terminal amine of the N-terminus of a peptidomimetic. The terminal amine may form a part of a residue or may form a part of an amino acid surrogate ring. In one aspect, the N-terminus group forms a part of an amino acid surrogate which is at the N-terminus position of the peptidomimetic. In another aspect, the N-terminus group forms a part of an amino acid residue which is at the N-terminus position of the peptidomimetic. The N-terminus group includes, but is not limited to,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—NH(v\n3\n),\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—CH\n3\n,\n\n\n—C(═O)—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—CH\n3\n,\n\n\n—C(═O)—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—NH(v\n3\n),\n\n\n—C(═O)—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—C(═O)—OH,\n\n\n—C(═O)—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—C(═O)—(v\n4\n),\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—C(═O)—OH,\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—C(═O)—(v\n4\n),\n\n\n—C(═O)—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—O(v\n3\n),\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—O(v\n3\n),\n\n\n—C(═O)—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—S(v\n3\n), or\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—S(v\n3\n),\n\n\nincluding all (R) or (S) configurations of the foregoing, where v\n3 \nis H or a C\n1 \nto C\n17 \nlinear or branched alkyl chain, v\n4 \nis a C\n1 \nto C\n17 \nlinear or branched alkyl chain and r is 0 to 17; or any omega amino aliphatic, acyl group or terminal aryl or aralkyl including groups such as methyl, dimethyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, hexyl, allyl, cyclopropane methyl, hexanoyl, heptanoyl, acetyl, propionoyl, butanoyl, phenylacetyl, cyclohexylacetyl, naphthylacetyl, cinnamoyl, phenyl, benzyl, benzoyl, 12-Ado, 7′-amino heptanoyl, 6-Ahx, Amc or 8-Aoc, including all (R) or (S) configurations of the foregoing.\n\n\nThe chemical naming protocol and structure diagrams used herein employ and rely on the chemical naming features as utilized by the ChemDraw program (available from Cambridgesoft Corp.) or ISIS Draw (available from MDL Information Systems Inc.). In particular, certain compound names were derived from the structures using the Autonom program as utilized by Chemdraw Ultra or ISIS Draw. In general, structure diagrams do not depict hydrogen atoms other than in terminal groups and other special circumstances.\n\n\nCertain peptidomimetics are depicted herein with the surrogates identified by structure diagrams and the amino acid residues identified by a three letter abbreviation. Unless otherwise specified, it is understood that the bond between the surrogate and residue, or between the residue and surrogate, or between a surrogate and residues on both the N-terminus and C-terminus side thereof, is a conventional peptide bond, —C(═O)—NH— or, in the case where the peptide bond is to the ring nitrogen on the N-terminus of the surrogate, —C(═O)—N—. In general, in the depiction of such bonds the atoms of the amino acid surrogate are depicted (e.g., —C(═O)— or —N), but atoms of the amino acid residue are not depicted.\n\n\n2.

It is understood that if the amino acid surrogate of formula I is to be coupled at the C-terminus position of the peptidomimetic, other than a carboxyl terminus may be employed on such surrogate.\n\n\nThus in a preferred embodiment the invention provides ring-constrained amino acid surrogates for incorporation, by way of peptide synthesis methodologies, modified as appropriate, into peptidomimetics of the invention, which peptidomimetics comprise a plurality of amino acid residues.\n\n\nExcept where both R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare H, it is to be appreciated that each surrogate employed in the invention can be in one of four different enantiomeric forms. Thus, by way of example, where the R\n1 \ngroup is an amino acid side chain moiety of Arg, the compound may be generically shown as:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere each asterisk represents a chiral center which may be in any stereochemical configuration. Thus, it is to be understood that each of the following is possible, contemplated and intended:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, with respect to each surrogate, for use in the synthesis of peptidomimetics using conventional peptide synthetic methodologies, it is understood that if a surrogate is other than at the N-terminal position that the R\n3 \nposition will include a nitrogen protecting group rather than H, and thus will be of the following general structure:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere PRG is a nitrogen protecting group, such as, by way of example and not limitation, a group of the formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere R\n12 \nis tert-butyl, allyl, or a group of a formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus it may be seen, in the example where the R\n1 \nor R\n2 \ngroup is an amino acid side chain moiety of Arg and R\n3 \nis the nitrogen protecting group Fmoc, that each of the following is possible, contemplated and intended:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the specific example above, it is also possible and contemplated that a nitrogen protecting group, such as for example Pbf, would be employed in the guanidino group. It may also be seen that analogous surrogates are possible and contemplated employing another group as the nitrogen protecting group or another amino acid side chain moiety or derivative of an amino acid side chain moiety as the R\n1 \nor R\n2 \ngroup, or alternatively, where at least one thereof is alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, alkyl-N(R\n9\n)\n2\n, alkyl-OR\n9\n, alkyl-C(═O)OR\n9\n, C(═O)OR\n9\n, alkyl-S—R\n9\n, alkyl-C(═O)N(R\n9\n)\n2\n, or a group of a formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere R\n9 \nis H, aryl, or alkyl and R\n11 \nis H or a second nitrogen protecting group.\n\n\n\nIf a surrogate is employed in the synthesis of peptidomimetics using conventional peptide synthetic methodologies and is at the C-terminal position, then the surrogate may be a compound that is bonded to a peptide solid support, such as a resin. In this instance the surrogate may be of the following general structure:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere the oval depicts resin and a linker or another peptide solid support. Here too the R\n1 \nor R\n2 \ngroup may be any amino acid side chain moiety or derivative of an amino acid side chain moiety, or alternatively, at least one thereof may be alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, alkyl-N(R\n9\n)\n2\n, alkyl-OR\n9\n, alkyl-C(═O)OR\n9\n, C(═O)OR\n9\n, alkyl-S—R\n9\n, alkyl-C(═O)N(R\n9\n)\n2\n, or a group of a formula:\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere R\n9 \nis H, aryl, or alkyl and R\n11 \nis H or a second nitrogen protecting group.\n\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention thus employs surrogates of the following general structure:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere R\n1 \nis one of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n3 \nis H or a first nitrogen protecting group;\n\n\nR\n4 \nis H, alkyl, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)OH, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)NR\n10\n, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)OR\n10\n, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOH, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOBn, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOallyl, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)N(R\n9\n)\n2\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)N(R\n9\n)(CH\n2\n)\np\nN(R\n9\n)\n2\n;\n\n\nR\n5 \nis H or alkyl;\n\n\nR\n9 \nis H, aryl, or alkyl;\n\n\nR\n10 \nis a peptide solid support;\n\n\neach occurrence of m is an independent integer having a value between 0 and 6;\n\n\neach occurrence of q is an independent integer having a value between 1 and 6;\n\n\np is an integer having a value between 1 and 10; and\n\n\nany aryl group may be substituted independently with one or more substituents selected from alkyl, haloalkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, halo, nitro, acyl, cyano, amino, monosubstituted amino, disubstituted amino, hydroxy, carboxy, or alkoxy-carbonyl.\n\n\nThus in one aspect there are provided surrogates with an R\n1 \ngroup which is an amino acid side chain moiety of one of the nineteen naturally-coded amino acid residues (omitting Pro), including the following where R\n1 \nis as shown, R\n3 \nis H, R\n4 \nis —C(═O)OH, and R\n5 \nis H:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also possible and contemplated to employ an R\n1 \ngroup which is an amino acid side chain moiety of an amino acid residue other than a naturally-coded amino acid residue. By way of example, and not limitation, specifically included are amino acid side chain moieties of amino acid residues including Orn, HPhe, Abu, Apr, HArg, HSer and the like. In one aspect modifications may include varying the length of an R\n1 \naliphatic linear or branched chain. Thus in one example the R\n1 \ngroup is an amino acid side chain moiety of norleucine:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nHowever, as set forth above the R\n1 \ngroup may similarly be —CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n3\n, —(CH\n2\n)\n2\n—CH\n3\n, —(CH\n2\n)\n3\n—CH\n3\n, —(CH\n2\n)\n4\n—CH\n3\n, —(CH\n2\n)\n5\n—CH\n3\n, or —(CH\n2\n)\n6\n—CH\n3\n.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, any R\n1 \ngroup may include one or more substituents. Thus in one example the R\n1 \ngroup is an amino acid side chain moiety of phenylalanine where the phenyl ring is substituted with one or more substituents, including hydroxyl, halogen, alkyl, or aryl groups attached directly or through an ether linkage.\n\n\nIn each of the foregoing, rather than H in the R\n3 \nposition there may be any nitrogen protecting group; rather than —C(═O)OH the R\n4 \nposition may be alkyl, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)OH, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)NR\n10\n, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)OR\n10\n, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOH, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOBn, (CH\n2\n)\nq\nOallyl, (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)N(R\n9\n)\n2\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nm\nC(═O)N(R\n9\n)(CH\n2\n)\np\nN(R\n9\n)\n2 \nwhere R\n9 \nis H, aryl, or alkyl, R\n10 \nis a peptide solid support, m is an independent integer having a value between 0 and 6, q is an independent integer having a value between 1 and 6 and p is an integer having a value between 1 and 10; and rather than H the R\n5 \nposition may be alkyl. Similarly, rather than one of the foregoing amino acid side chain moieties, R\n1 \nmay be alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, alkyl-N(R\n9\n)\n2\n, alkyl-OR\n9\n, alkyl-C(═O)OR\n9\n, C(═O)OR\n9\n, alkyl-S—R\n9\n, alkyl-C(═O)N(R\n9\n)\n2\n, or a group of a formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere R\n9 \nis H, aryl, or alkyl and R\n11 \nis H or a second nitrogen protecting group.\n\n\n3. Isomeric Purity and Isolation\n\n\nThe surrogates employed in peptidomimetics of the invention can contain one or more chiral centers and/or double bonds and, therefore, exist as stereoisomers, such as double-bond isomers (i.e., geometric isomers), enantiomers, or diastereomers. According to the invention, the chemical structures depicted herein, and therefore the peptidomimetics of the invention, encompass the racemic form of surrogates as well as all enantiomers and stereoisomers, that is, both the stereomerically pure form (e.g., geometrically pure, enantiomerically pure, or diastereomerically pure) and enantiomeric and stereoisomeric mixtures.\n\n\nA surrogate is considered optically active or enantiomerically pure (i.e., substantially the R-form or substantially the S-form) with respect to a chiral center when the compound is about 90% ee (enantiomeric excess) or greater, preferably, equal to or greater than 95% ee with respect to a particular chiral center. A peptidomimetic of the invention is considered to be in enantiomerically enriched form when the peptidomimetic has an enantiomeric excess of greater than about 80% ee, preferably greater than about 85% ee. As used herein, a racemic mixture means about 50% of one enantiomer and about 50% of its corresponding enantiomer relative to all chiral centers in the molecule. Thus, the invention encompasses all enantiomerically pure, enantiomerically enriched, and racemic mixtures of peptidomimetics of the invention.\n\n\nThus in one aspect, the surrogate has the general structure:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere the asterisk indicates any possible stereochemical conformation. This thus includes the following enantiomeric forms:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnantiomeric and stereoisomeric mixtures can be resolved into their component enantiomers or stereoisomers by well known methods, such as chiral-phase gas chromatography, chiral-phase high performance liquid chromatography, crystallizing the compound as a chiral salt complex, or crystallizing the compound in a chiral solvent. Enantiomers and stereoisomers can also be obtained from stereomerically- or enantiomerically-pure intermediates, reagents, and catalysts by well known asymmetric synthetic methods.\n\n\n4.

Formulation and Use of Peptidomimetics of the Invention\n\n\nPeptidomimetics made using one or more surrogates of formula I can be used for both medical applications and animal husbandry or veterinary applications. Typically, the peptidomimetic, or a pharmaceutical composition including the peptidomimetic, is used in humans, but may also be used in other mammals. The term “patient” is intended to denote a mammalian individual, and is so used throughout the specification and in the claims. The primary applications of this invention involve human patients, but this invention may be applied to laboratory, farm, zoo, wildlife, pet, sport or other animals.\n\n\nThe peptidomimetics disclosed herein, or made by methods disclosed herein, may be used for the treatment of any condition, syndrome or disease, and in particular for any condition, syndrome or disease for which a melanocortin receptor-specific peptide has some efficacy. The peptidomimetics disclosed herein, or made by methods disclosed herein, can have one or more advantages relative to melanocortin receptor-specific peptides, including but not limited to advantages such as increased resistance to enzymatic degradation, increased circulation half life, increased bioavailability, increased efficacy, increased specificity, prolonged duration of effect and combinations of the foregoing. Such advantages are due, in whole or part, to use of the surrogates of formula I.\n\n\nSalt Form of Peptidomimetics. The peptidomimetics of this invention may be in the form of any pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic or organic bases and inorganic or organic acids. Salts derived from inorganic bases include salts of aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc, and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethyl-morpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine, and the like.\n\n\nWhen the peptidomimetic of the present invention is basic, acid addition salts may be prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids, including inorganic and organic acids. Such acids include acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, carboxylic, citric, ethanesulfonic, formic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, malonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, propionic, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, p-toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, and the like.

The acetate salt form is especially useful. Where the peptidomimetics of embodiments of this invention include an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts may include alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium salts, or alkaline earth metal salts, such as calcium or magnesium salts.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions. Another embodiment of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition that includes a peptidomimetic of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier may be a liquid formulation, and is preferably a buffered, isotonic, aqueous solution. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers also include excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as hereafter described.\n\n\nThe peptidomimetics of the several embodiments of the present invention may be formulated or compounded into pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one peptidomimetic of this invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, including excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as may be desired. Formulation excipients may include polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, hydroxy cellulose, acacia, polyethylene glycol, manniton, sodium chloride and sodium citrate. For injection or other liquid administration formulations, water containing at least one or more buffering constituents is preferred, and stabilizing agents, preservatives and solubilizing agents may also be employed. For solid administration formulations, any of a variety of thickening, filler, bulking and carrier additives may be employed, such as starches, sugars, amino acids, fatty acids and the like. For topical administration formulations, any of a variety of creams, ointments, gels, lotions and the like may be employed. For most pharmaceutical formulations, non-active ingredients will constitute the greater part, by weight or volume, of the preparation. For pharmaceutical formulations, it is also contemplated that any of a variety of measured-release, slow-release or time-release formulations and additives may be employed, so that the dosage may be formulated so as to effect delivery of a peptidomimetic of this invention over a period of time.\n\n\nIn general, the actual quantity of peptidomimetics administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending on the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired.\n\n\nIn practical use, the peptidomimetics can be combined as the active ingredient in an admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, for example, oral, parenteral (including intravenous), urethral, vaginal, nasal, dermal, transdermal, pulmonary, deep lung, inhalation, buccal, sublingual, or the like. In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets.\n\n\nBecause of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent an advantageous oral dosage unit form. If desired, a composition including a peptidomimetic of this invention may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. The amount of active peptidomimetic in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. In another advantageous dosage unit form, sublingual pharmaceutical compositions may be employed, such as sheets, wafers, tablets or the like. The active peptidomimetic can also be administered intranasally as, for example, by liquid drops or spray.\n\n\nThe tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch or alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.\n\n\nVarious other materials may be utilized as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.\n\n\nPeptidomimetics may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of active peptidomimetics can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxy-propylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. These preparations may optionally contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. Lyophilized single unit formulations may also be employed, such as are reconstituted with saline prior to administration, and thus do not require a preservative.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders, such as lyophilized formulations, for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that it may be administered by syringe. The form must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol, for example glycerol, propylene glycol or liquid polyethylene glycol, suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.\n\n\nPeptidomimetics as disclosed herein may be therapeutically applied by means of nasal administration. By “nasal administration” is meant any form of intranasal administration of any of the peptidomimetics of this invention. The peptidomimetics may be in an aqueous solution, such as a solution including saline, citrate or other common excipients or preservatives. The peptidomimetics may also be in a dry or powder formulation.\n\n\nIn an alternative embodiment, peptidomimetics may be administered directly into the lung. Intrapulmonary administration may be performed by means of a metered dose inhaler, a device allowing self-administration of a metered bolus of a peptidomimetic of this invention when actuated by a patient during inspiration. Both dry powder inhalation and nebulized aerosols may be employed.\n\n\nAccording to another embodiment of the present invention, peptidomimetics of this invention may be formulated with any of a variety of agents that increase effective nasal absorption of drugs, including peptide drugs. These agents should increase nasal absorption without unacceptable damage to the mucosal membrane. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,693,608, 5,977,070 and 5,908,825, among others, teach a number of pharmaceutical compositions that may be employed, including absorption enhancers, and the teachings of each of the foregoing, and all references and patents cited therein, are incorporated by reference.\n\n\nIf in an aqueous solution, certain peptidomimetics of the present invention may be appropriately buffered by means of saline, acetate, phosphate, citrate, acetate or other buffering agents, which may be at any physiologically acceptable pH, generally from about pH 4 to about pH 7. A combination of buffering agents may also be employed, such as phosphate buffered saline, a saline and acetate buffer, and the like. In the case of saline, a 0.9% saline solution may be employed. In the case of acetate, phosphate, citrate, acetate and the like, a 50 mM solution may be employed. In addition to buffering agents, a suitable preservative may be employed, to prevent or limit bacteria and other microbial growth. One such preservative that may be employed is 0.05% benzalkonium chloride.\n\n\nIt is also possible and contemplated that the peptidomimetic may be in a dried and particulate form. In a preferred embodiment, the particles are between about 0.5 and 6.0 μm, such that the particles have sufficient mass to settle on the lung surface, and not be exhaled, but are small enough that they are not deposited on surfaces of the air passages prior to reaching the lung. Any of a variety of different techniques may be used to make dry powder microparticles, including but not limited to micro-milling, spray drying and a quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization. With micro-particles, the peptidomimetics may be deposited to the deep lung, thereby providing quick and efficient absorption into the bloodstream. Further, with such approach penetration enhancers are not required, as is sometimes the case in transdermal, nasal or oral mucosal delivery routes. Any of a variety of inhalers can be employed, including propellant-based aerosols, nebulizers, single dose dry powder inhalers and multidose dry powder inhalers. Common devices in current use include metered dose inhalers, which are used to deliver medications for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the like. Preferred devices include dry powder inhalers, designed to form a cloud or aerosol of fine powder with a particle size that is always less than about 6.0 μm.\n\n\nMicroparticle size, including mean size distribution, may be controlled by means of the method of making. For micro-milling, the size of the milling head, speed of the rotor, time of processing and the like control the microparticle size. For spray drying, the nozzle size, flow rate, dryer heat and the like control the microparticle size. For making by means of quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization, the nozzle size, flow rate, concentration of aerosoled solution and the like control the microparticle size. These parameters and others may be employed to control the microparticle size.\n\n\nThe peptidomimetics of this invention may be therapeutically administered by means of an injection, typically a deep intramuscular injection, such as in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, of a time release injectable formulation. In one embodiment, a peptidomimetic of this invention is formulated with a PEG, such as poly(ethylene glycol) 3350, and optionally one or more additional excipients and preservatives, including but not limited to excipients such as salts, polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid to adjust pH, and the like. In another embodiment a peptidomimetic of this invention is formulated with a poly(ortho ester), which may be an auto-catalyzed poly(ortho ester) with any of a variable percentage of lactic acid in the polymeric backbone, and optionally one or more additional excipients. In one embodiment poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) polymer (PLGA polymer) is employed, preferably a PLGA polymer with a hydrophilic end group, such as PLGA RG502H from Boehringer Ingelheim, Inc. (Ingelheim, Germany). Such formulations may be made, for example, by combining a peptidomimetic of this invention in a suitable solvent, such as methanol, with a solution of PLGA in methylene chloride, and adding thereto a continuous phase solution of polyvinyl alcohol under suitable mixing conditions in a reactor. In general, any of a number of injectable and biodegradable polymers, which are preferably also adhesive polymers, may be employed in a time release injectable formulation. The teachings of U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,938,763, 6,432,438, and 6,673,767, and the biodegradable polymers and methods of formulation disclosed therein, are incorporated here by reference. The formulation may be such that an injection is required on a weekly, monthly or other periodic basis, depending on the concentration and amount of peptidomimetic, the biodegradation rate of the polymer, and other factors known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\nRoutes of Administration. If it is administered by injection, the injection may be intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or other means known in the art. The peptidomimetics of this invention may be formulated by any means known in the art, including but not limited to formulation as tablets, capsules, caplets, suspensions, powders, lyophilized preparations, suppositories, ocular drops, skin patches, oral soluble formulations, sprays, aerosols and the like, and may be mixed and formulated with buffers, binders, excipients, stabilizers, anti-oxidants and other agents known in the art. In general, any route of administration by which the peptidomimetics of this invention are introduced across an epidermal layer of cells may be employed. Administration means may thus include administration through mucous membranes, buccal administration, oral administration, dermal administration, inhalation administration, pulmonary administration, nasal administration, urethral administration, vaginal administration, and the like.\n\n\nIn one aspect, a peptidomimetic of this invention is administered by means of a time release injectable formulation, such as a peptidomimetic of this invention in a formulation with a PEG, poly(ortho ester) or PLGA polymer. In another aspect, a peptidomimetic of this invention is administered by means of an automated delivery device providing subcutaneous delivery, either continuous or intermittent. A peptidomimetic of this invention may also be administered by transdermal administration.\n\n\nTherapeutically Effective Amount. In general, the actual quantity of peptidomimetic of this invention administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending upon the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired. The dosage for treatment is administration, by any of the foregoing means or any other means known in the art, of an amount sufficient to bring about the desired therapeutic effect. Thus a therapeutically effective amount includes an amount of a peptidomimetic or pharmaceutical composition of this invention that is sufficient to induce a desired effect.\n\n\nIn general, the compounds of this invention are highly active. For example, the compound can be administered at about 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, or 100 μg/kg body weight, depending on the specific peptidomimetics selected, the desired therapeutic response, the route of administration, the formulation and other factors known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\nTherapeutic Application. In one embodiment, peptidomimetics of this invention that are MC1-R specific can be used as chemoprevention agents against sun-induced, such as by UV radiation, neoplastic activity in human skin. MC1-R agonist peptidomimetics of this invention may be employed to stimulate epidermal melanocytes to produce melanin as well as to convert pheomelanin to eumelanin. Eumelanin, which is dark brown or black pigmentation, is considered more photo-protective than pheomelanin, which is yellow or red pigmentation. The process of melanogenesis is believed to involve stimulation of MC1-R in epidermal melanocytes, thereby mediating the stimulation of tyrosinase enzymes within these pigment cells, inducing the conversion of tyrosine to dopa and then through dopaquinone to eumelanin. Sun tanning due to direct sun exposure is proposed to result from the same pathway by local production of melanotropic peptide from a POMC gene in the epidermis. Thus, stimulation of eumelanin production and conversion of pheomelanin to eumelanin may be a desirable chemoprevention modality in blocking sun- or UV-induced neoplastic activity in skin. A potent, high-affinity and highly selective MC1-R agonist peptidomimetic of this invention can accordingly be used as a therapeutic chemoprevention agent for combating harmful sun or UV exposure that induces neoplastic activity in skin melanocytes.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, peptidomimetics of this invention, including but not limited to peptidomimetics that are MC4-R agonists, partial agonists or functionally inactive may be used as a therapeutic agent to modify energy metabolism and feeding behavior, including treatment of pathologic obesity and related conditions. In addition to use in treatment of patients clinically diagnosed as obese, peptidomimetics of this invention may be employed with persons who are above optimal body weight, as an aid in weight loss.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, peptidomimetics of this invention, including but not limited to MC4-R antagonists, may be used as a therapeutic agent in eating disorders, such as treatment of anorexia and cachexia, which is malnutrition and wasting due to illness. In addition to use in treatment of patients diagnosed with anorexia or cachexia, peptidomimetics of this invention may be employed with persons who have below optimal body weight, and in particular with patients desiring to gain additional muscle mass.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, peptidomimetics of this invention can be used as therapeutic agents for treatment of sexual dysfunction, including treatment of both male erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, peptidomimetics of this invention may be used as therapeutic agents for treatment of inflammation, including specifically MC1-R, MC3-R and MC5-R agonists.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment of the invention, peptidomimetics of this invention that are MC5-R specific can be used as agents to decrease sebum production, and thus may be efficacious in the treatment of acne and related diseases. The peptidomimetics for this application may be conveniently formulated for local administration, as through a gel, lotion, cream or other topical formulation.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, peptidomimetics of this invention may be employed in the treatment of drug or alcohol dependence, depression, anxiety and related conditions and indications.\n\n\n6. Synthetic Methods for Surrogates Incorporated into Peptidomimetics\n\n\nThe surrogates of formula I can be obtained via standard, synthetic methodology. Some convenient methods are illustrated in the Schemes below. Starting materials useful for preparing the compounds of the invention and intermediates therefor, are commercially available or can be prepared from commercially available materials using known synthetic methods and reagents.\n\n\nProtecting groups utilized herein denote groups which generally are not found in the final peptidomimetic but which are intentionally introduced at some stage of the synthesis in order to protect groups which otherwise might be altered in the course of chemical manipulations. Such protecting groups are removed or converted to the desired group at a later stage of the synthesis and compounds bearing such protecting groups thus are of importance primarily as chemical intermediates (although some derivatives also exhibit biological activity). Accordingly, the precise structure of the protecting group is not critical.\n\n\nNumerous reactions for the formation and removal of such protecting groups are described in a number of standard works including, for example, \nProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\n, Plenum Press, London and New York, 1973; Greene, Th. W. \nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\n, Wiley, New York, 1981\n; The Peptides\n, Vol. I, Schroder and Lubke, Academic Press, London and New York, 1965; and \nMethoden der organischen Chemie\n, Houben-Weyl, 4th Edition, Vol. 15/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe following examples of methods of synthesis of amino acid surrogates of formula I are intended to be exemplary, and it is to be understood that variations thereon may be undertaken by one of skill in the art, and such variations are intended to be included herein.\n\n\nSynthesis of Ketopiperazine Scaffolds Mimicking Amino Acids without Functionalized R Side Chain (Methods A and B)\n\n\nThe surrogates were prepared by a variety of methods as described in Methods A and B.\n\n\nMethod A: The dipeptides (3) were formed by the mixed anhydride method, using Boc-serine (OBn)-OH (1), and an α-amino ester (2). The dipeptides were obtained in high yields, and usually no purification was required. Reduction of both the methyl ester and the amide group was done using diborane-tetrahydrofuran, with the secondary amines protected to give the di-Boc protected amino alcohol intermediates (4). Oxidation of the alcohols with pyridinium dichromate (PDC) with concomitant cyclization gave the piperazine-2-ones (5) in one step. Benzyl ether removal by hydrogenation, followed by protecting group exchange gave the Fmoc protected piperazine-2-ones (6). Finally, the primary alcohol was oxidized to the acid by any of a number of different methods (PDC, Jones oxidation, ruthenium chloride-sodium periodate, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, free radical (TEMPO) oxidation) to give the final products (7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesis of 2-(3-benzyloxy-2-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-propionylamino)-2-substituted acetic acid methyl ester (3): To a solution of 10 mmol of Boc serine benzyl ether (1) in 30 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, kept at −20° C. under nitrogen, was added 22 mmol of triethylamine, followed by the slow addition of 11.4 mmol of isobutylchloroformate. A white solid precipitated out. The slurry was stirred for 15 minutes, and then 11.1 mmol of α-amino ester (2) was added in one portion. The slurry was stirred at −20° C. for 30 minutes, and then allowed to warm up to room temperature, stirred for 2 hours, and then concentrated to dryness. The mixture was then partitioned between 50 mL of ethyl acetate/30 mL of 1N hydrochloric acid solution. The layers were separated, and the organic layer washed with 1×20 mL of 1N hydrochloric acid, and 1×20 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated. Compounds (3) were usually obtained in yields above 90%, and no purification was required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nAnalytical Data for Compounds (3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR δ (CDCl\n3\n): 1.43 (s, 9H, \nt\nBu), 3.0-3.18 (two sets of dd, 2H, CH\n2\n-Ph), 3.50-3.57 (t, 1H, CH\n2\nO), 3.68 (s, 3H, CH\n3\nO), 3.87-3.96 (br. d, 1H, CH\n2\nO), 4.23-4.33 (br. m, 1H, CHN), 4.45-4.57 (dd, 2H, CH\n2\nO), 4.80-4.88 (m, 1H, CHN), 5.30-5.37 (m, 1H, NH), 7.0-7.38 (a series of m, 10H, Ph), yield =96%, t\nR \n= 6.88 min, (M\n+\n + 1) = 456.99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR δ (CDCl\n3\n): 0.81-0.96 (a series of m, 6H, CH\n3\n), 1.00-1.16 (m, 1H, CH\n2\n), 1.30-1.45 (m, 1H, CH\n2\n), 1.45 (s, 9H, \nt\nBu), 1.80-1.96 (m, 1H, CH), 3.54-3.64 (dd, 1H, CH\n2\nO), 3.70 (s, 3H, CH\n3\nO), 3.82-3.96 (dd, 1H, CH\n2\nO), 4.28-4.40 (m, 1H, CHN), 4.51-4.61 (m, and s, 3H, CH\n2\nO, and CHN), 5.51-5.61 (br. d, 1H, NH), 7.12-7.37 (br. m, 5H, Ph), yield = quant., t\nR \n= 6.93 min, (M\n+\n + 1) = 423.25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1\nH NMR δ (CDCl\n3\n): 1.45 (s, 9H, \nt\nBu), 3.73 (s, 3H, CH\n3\nO), 3.84-3.90 (m, 2H, CH\n2\nN), 4.01-4.17 (m, 2H, CH\n2\nO), 4.32-4.38 (br. m, 1H, CHN), 4.54-4.58 (d, 2H, CH\n2\nO), 5.46-5.57 (d, 1H, NH), 7.05-7.12 (br. m, 1H, Ph), 7.24-7.40 (m, 4H, Ph), yield = quant., t\nR \n= 5.51 min, (M\n+\n + 1) = 367.07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesis of Di-Boc-2-substituted-(2-amino-3-benzyloxy-propyl-amino)-ethanol (4): To a solution of 35 mmol of (3) in 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, kept at room temperature under nitrogen, was added 200 mL of 1N diborane solution in tetrahydrofuran. The solution was stirred at room temperature overnight, and then slowly poured over an ice-cold solution of 200 mL of 1N hydrochloric acid solution. The biphasic solution was then neutralized with solid sodium hydroxide. 140 mL of a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate was added, followed by 70 mmol of di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate, and the mixture stirred for 2 days at room temperature, diluted with 200 mL of ethyl acetate and the layers separated.

The Fmoc O-protected serinal (9) required for the reductive amination was prepared according to method D, either by reduction of the ester (12) by di-isobutylaluminum hydride, by oxidation of Fmoc O-protected serinol (13) with Dess-Martin periodinane, or by reduction of the Fmoc O-protected serine Weinreb amide (14) with lithium aluminum hydride. The preferred method for the preparation of Fmoc O-protected serinals (9) was the reduction of the Weinreb amide analog. (2-Fmoc-amino-3-R′—O-propylamino)-2-substituted acetic acid methyl esters (10) were then N and O deprotected, cyclized, and Fmoc protected to give 3-substituted 6-hydroxymethyl-piperazin-2-ones (6), which were then oxidized to the final product (7) as described in method A.\n\n\nThe protecting group (R′) on the hydroxyl group of Fmoc-O-protected serinal (9) used in the synthesis depends on the nature of the side chain R of the amino ester.

In one aspect, an α,α-disubstituted amino acid is employed in either the Aaa\n1 \nor Aaa\n8 \nposition, wherein at least one of the side chains of the α,α-disubstituted amino acid is a side chain of Nle, Ala, Leu, Ile, Val, Nva, Met(O) or Met(O\n2\n). The following synthetic Methods P and Q describe making α,α-di-n-butylglycine (2-Amino-2-butyl-hexanoic acid), wherein each of the side chains are —(CH\n2\n)\n3\n—CH\n3\n, and thus each is the same as the side chain of Nle. However, it is to be understood that similar methods and schemes may be employed in the making of other α,α-disubstituted amino acids, where the substituents are either the same or different. Additionally, any method of making an α,α-disubstituted amino acid may be employed in the practice of this invention, and the practice of this invention is not limited to the methods of the following synthetic schemes. Thus any method known in the art for the synthesis of α,α-disubstituted amino acids may be employed in the practice of this invention.

The reaction is cooled to room temperature, concentrated to dryness, redissolved in 30 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and 10 mL of water and 30 mmol of sodium bicarbonate is added, followed by 15 mmol of Fmoc-Cl. The biphasic solution is stirred for 1 hour, and the tetrahydrofuran removed under vacuum. The aqueous solution is extracted with 1×50 mL of diethyl ether, acidified with 1N hydrochloric acid solution, and extracted with 2×50 mL of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layers are combined, dry over sodium sulfate, and concentrated. Compound (81) is purified by silica gel column chromatography.\n\n\nSimilar methods may be employed by starting with any appropriate amino acid derivative (similar to compound 78), and by using an appropriate alkyl butyl, aryl butyl, or aralkyl butyl reagent the scheme will yield a variety of disubstituted (R, R′) amino acid surrogates where R and R′ are different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesis of Fmoc-α,α di-n-butyl glycine (87): To a suspension of 20 mmol of glycine methyl ester hydrochloride (82), and 2 g of powdered molecular sieves in 40 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, kept at room temperature, is added 24 mmol of potassium hydroxide, followed by 22 mmol of benzaldehyde. The suspension is stirred for 2 hours, filtered, and the filtrate concentrated. The residue is redissolved in 40 mL of dry toluene, and then added to a suspension of 60 mmol of sodium hydride in toluene, followed by the addition of 60 mmol of n-butyl bromide. The suspension is stirred for 12 hours, followed by addition of 30 mL of a solution of 6N hydrochloric acid, stirred at room temperature for 2 hours, and then the layers separated. The hydrochloride salt of (84) thus obtained is used in situ for preparation of (87). To isolate (84) as the hydrochloride salt the aqueous layer is concentrated to dryness and the product crystallized from dry methanol-ether.\n\n\nAlternatively, compound (84) can be prepared from norleucine methyl ester hydrochloride using a similar synthetic procedure except that 30 mmol of sodium hydride and 30 mmol of n-butyl bromide are used for conversion of (86) to (84).\n\n\nThe aqueous mixture of the hydrochloride form of compound (84) as obtained above is heated to reflux for 1 hour and then cooled to room temperature.

The following method describes synthesis of Fmoc protected (R)-5,5-dibutyl-6-oxo-piperazine-2-carboxylic acid, where R and R′ are each groups corresponding to a norleucine side chain moiety.

Synthetic Methods for Peptidomimetics Including Surrogates\n\n\nThe peptidomimetics including one or more surrogates of formula I as disclosed in the several embodiments of this invention may be readily synthesized by any known conventional procedure for the formation of a peptide linkage between amino acids. Such conventional procedures include, for example, any solution phase procedure permitting a condensation between the free α-amino group of an amino acid residue having its carboxyl group or other reactive groups protected and the free primary carboxyl group of another amino acid residue having its amino group or other reactive groups protected. In a preferred conventional procedure, the peptidomimetics of this invention may be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis and purified according to methods known in the art. The amino acid surrogates may be incorporated into peptidomimetics of this invention by methods substantially similar to or identical to those employed with residues. Any of a number of well-known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the peptidomimetics of this invention.\n\n\nThe process for synthesizing the peptidomimetics may be carried out by a procedure whereby each amino acid or amino acid surrogate in the desired sequence is added one at a time in succession to another amino acid residue or amino acid surrogate or by a procedure whereby peptide fragments with the desired amino acid sequence, which may include one or more amino acid surrogates, are first synthesized conventionally and then condensed to provide the desired peptidomimetics. The resulting peptidomimetic may optionally be cyclized to yield a cyclic peptidomimetic of the invention.\n\n\nSolid phase peptide synthesis methods are well known and practiced in the art. In such methods the synthesis of compounds of the invention can be carried out by sequentially incorporating the desired amino acid residues or amino acid surrogates one at a time into the growing peptide chain according to the general principles of solid phase methods. These methods are disclosed in numerous references, including Merrifield R. B., Solid phase synthesis (Nobel lecture). \nAngew. Chem. \n24:799-810 (1985) and Barany et al., \nThe Peptides, Analysis, Synthesis and Biology\n, Vol. 2, Gross E. and Meienhofer J., Eds. Academic Press, 1-284 (1980).\n\n\nIn chemical syntheses of peptidomimetics, reactive side chain groups of the various amino acid residues or amino acid surrogates are protected with suitable protecting groups, which prevent a chemical reaction from occurring at that site until the protecting group is removed. Also common is the protection of the α-amino group of an amino acid residue or amino acid surrogate while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed by the selective removal of the α-amino protecting group to allow a subsequent reaction to take place at that site. Specific protecting groups have been disclosed and are known in solid phase synthesis methods and solution phase synthesis methods.\n\n\nα-amino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, including a urethane-type protecting group, such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, such as p-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-biphenyl-isopropoxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Moz); aliphatic urethane-type protecting groups, such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, isopropoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl. Fmoc is preferred for α-amino protection.\n\n\nGuanidino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, such as nitro, p-toluenesulfonyl (Tos), Z, pentamethylchromanesulfonyl (Pmc), adamantyloxycarbonyl, pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Pbf), Fmoc and Boc. Pbf is one preferred protecting group for Arg. Other preferred protecting groups include Z, Fmoc, and Boc. It is to be understood that particularly guanidino protecting groups may be cleaved and removed during the synthetic process, or may alternatively not be cleaved or removed, in which event the side chain with the protecting group forms a derivative of an amino acid side chain moiety as defined herein. Particularly where the protecting group is labile, and may be removed by some mechanism in vivo upon administration to a patient, the peptidomimetic becomes a “prodrug”, which is to say a compound that is a drug precursor which, following administration to a patient, is converted to the desired drug form in vivo via some chemical or physiological process (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to physiological pH or through enzyme action is converted to the desired drug form).\n\n\nThe peptidomimetics of the invention described herein can be prepared using solid phase synthesis, either manually or by means of an automated peptide synthesizer, using programming modules as provided by the manufacturer and following the protocols set forth by the manufacturer, or by modifications of the manufacturer's protocols to improve the yield of difficult couplings.\n\n\nSolid phase synthesis is conveniently commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptidomimetic by coupling a protected α-amino acid, α-amino acid surrogate or α-amino alcohol mimetic to a suitable resin. Such starting material is prepared by attaching an α-amino-protected amino acid or α-amino-protected amino acid surrogate by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin or a 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin, by an amide bond between an Fmoc-Linker, such as p-[(R,S)-α-[1-(9H-fluor-en-9-yl)-methoxyformamido]-2,4-dimethyloxybenzyl]-phenoxyacetic acid (Rink linker) to a benzhydrylamine (BHA) resin, or by other means well known in the art, such as by attaching an α-amino-protected alcohol mimetic to 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-yl-methanol linker attached to chloromethyl polystyrene resin. Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin supports are commercially available and generally used when feasible. The resins are carried through repetitive cycles as necessary to add amino acids sequentially. The α-amino Fmoc protecting groups are removed under basic conditions. Piperidine, piperazine, diethylamine, or morpholine (20-40% v/v) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) may be used for this purpose.\n\n\nFollowing removal of the α-amino protecting group, the subsequent protected amino acids or amino acid surrogates are coupled stepwise in the desired order to obtain an intermediate, protected peptide-resin. The activating reagents used for coupling of the amino acids in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the art. After the peptidomimetic is synthesized, if desired, the orthogonally protected side chain protecting groups may be removed using methods well known in the art for further derivatization of the compound.\n\n\nReactive groups in a peptidomimetic can be selectively modified, either during solid phase synthesis or after removal from the resin. For example, compounds can be modified to obtain N-terminus modifications, such as acetylation, while on resin, or may be removed from the resin by use of a cleaving reagent and then modified. Methods for N-terminus modification, such as acetylation, or C-terminus modification, such as amidation or introduction of an N-acetyl group, are known in the art. Similarly, methods for modifying side chains of amino acids are well known to those skilled in the art of peptide synthesis. The choice of modifications made to reactive groups present on the peptidomimetic will be determined, in part, by the characteristics that are desired in the peptidomimetic.\n\n\nThe peptidomimetics are, in one embodiment, cyclized prior to cleavage from the resin. For cyclization through reactive side chain moieties, the desired side chains are deprotected, and the compound suspended in a suitable solvent and a cyclic coupling agent added. Suitable solvents include, for example DMF, dichloromethane (DCM) or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Suitable cyclic coupling reagents include, for example, 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (BOP), benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris(pyrrolidino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), 2-(7-aza-1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TATU), 2-(2-oxo-1(2H)-pyridyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TPTU) or N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole (DCCl/HOBt). Coupling is conventionally initiated by use of a suitable base, such as N,N-diispropylethylamine (DIPEA), sym-collidine or N-methylmorpholine (NMM).\n\n\nFollowing cleavage of peptidomimetics from the solid phase following synthesis, the peptidomimetic can be purified by any number of methods, such as reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), using a suitable column, such as a C\n18 \ncolumn. Other methods of separation or purification, such as methods based on the size or charge of the peptidomimetic, can also be employed. Once purified, the peptidomimetic can be characterized by any number of methods, such as high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC), amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and the like.\n\n\nPeptidomimetics of the present invention with a substituted amide derivative C-terminus, typically an N-alkyl group, are prepared by solid phase synthesis commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptidomimetic by coupling a protected α-amino acid or amino acid surrogate to a suitable resin. Such methods for preparing substituted amide derivatives on solid phase have been described in the art. See, for example, Barn D. R., Morphy J. R., Rees D. C. Synthesis of an array of amides by aluminum chloride assisted cleavage of resin-bound esters. \nTetrahedron Lett. \n37, 3213-3216 (1996); DeGrado W. F., Kaiser E. T. Solid-phase synthesis of protected peptides on a polymer bound oxime: Preparation of segments comprising the sequences of a cytotoxic 26-peptide analogue. \nJ. Org. Chem. \n47:3258-3261 (1982). Such starting material can be prepared by attaching an α-amino-protected amino acid or amino acid surrogate by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin by well known means. The peptide chain is grown with the desired sequence of amino acids or amino acid surrogates, the product cyclized and resin-treated with a solution of appropriate amine and aluminum chloride (such as methyl amine, dimethyl amine, ethylamine, and so on) in dichloromethane. The resulting amide derivative peptidomimetic is released in solution from the resin. The resin is filtered and the amide derivative peptidomimetic recovered by concentration of solvent followed by precipitation with ether. The crude peptidomimetic is dried and remaining amino acid side chain protective groups cleaved using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in the presence of water and 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT). The final product is precipitated by adding cold ether and collected by filtration. Final purification is by RP-HPLC using a C\n18 \ncolumn.\n\n\nIn one preferred method, peptidomimetics are synthesized by the following methods. Each of the peptidomimetics has one or two amino acid surrogates based on a keto-piperazine structure. The amino acid surrogates were synthesized as described above. The peptidomimetics are synthesized using Fmoc chemistry. A manual synthetic approach is used for couplings immediately before and after incorporation of the keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate.\n\n\nThe following protocol is employed to attach an amino acid surrogate to resin, such as where the amino acid surrogate was in a terminal position. Rink amide resin (loading at 0.3 mmol/g, Advanced ChemTech) is allowed to swell in DMF for 30 minutes. Fmoc deprotection of the resin was accomplished using 20% piperidine/DMF for 20 minutes. Coupling of the resin with the selected Fmoc-protected keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate (2 eq) is accomplished by overnight incubation in DMF with PyBop (2 eq) and DIEA (4 eq). If following Kaiser testing a positive result is obtained, the coupling reaction is conducting a second time. Acetylation, if required, is carried out using Ac\n2\nO (10 eq) and pyridine (20 eq) in DMF.\n\n\nThe following protocol is employed to attach a keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate to peptide-resin. Coupling is carried out by mixing Fmoc-protected keto piperazine amino acid surrogate (2 eq), TBTU (2 eq) and DIEA (4 eq) in DMF and overnight incubation, again with a repeat of the coupling reaction if a positive Kaiser test is obtained. Acetylation is carried out using Ac\n2\nO (10 eq) and pyridine (20 eq) in DMF.\n\n\nThe following protocol is employed to couple an Fmoc-protected amino acid to a keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate on solid phase. In most instances at least two coupling cycles were needed, and frequently three cycles were employed. In a typical cycle Fmoc-protected amino acid (4 eq) is mixed with HOAt (4 eq) and DIC (4 eq) in DMF for 30 minutes. The resulted mixture is then mixed overnight in a SPE tube with a keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate attached directly or through intermediates to resin.\n\n\nCouplings between amino acids that were not directly adjacent to a keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate in the sequence are conducted using standard protocols for solid phase peptide synthesis.\n\n\nThe following protecting groups are employed: Boc for Lys and Orn, t-Butyl for Tyr and Ser, Trityl for Cys and His, O-t-Butyl for Asp and Pbf for Arg.\n\n\nPeptidomimetics are cleaved from resin employing a mixture of TFA/thioanisole/phenol/H\n2\nO/EDT (87.5/2.5/2.5/5/2.5) (5 mL) for 3 hours. The resulting material is filtered and precipitated from cold ether under freezing conditions for one hour.\n\n\nFor peptidomimetic compounds containing cysteine or other amino acid residues with reactive sulfhydrals, which are intended to be cyclized by means of disulfide bond formation, the precipitated cysteinyl peptidomimetic is washed with cold ether at least three times before being use in an oxidation step. For cyclization to form disulfide bonds via air oxidation, crude cysteinyl compound is dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile and water. The pH of the reaction mixture is adjusted to 7-8 using 5% NH\n4\nOH. The resulted solution is stirred slowly with 150 mg granular activated carbon for 2 days. Completion of cyclization is confirmed by LC-MS analysis before proceeding to the next process step. After cyclization, solid carbon is filtered from solution. The filtrate is lyophilized or dried in a speed-vac to obtain crude cyclic compound.\n\n\nFor peptidomimetic compounds intended to be cyclized by means of a lactam bridge, in one embodiment the lactam bridge may be formed prior to cleavage of the peptidomimetic from the resin. A peptidomimetic-resin is synthesized with orthogonally protected amino acid side chain functionalities forming the bridge. For example, orthogonal side chains protection may comprise an alloc group for side chain amine group protection and an allyl ester group for carboxyl protection. After synthesis of the peptidomimetic on the resin, both the alloc and allyl ester groups can be selectively removed, such as by treating the peptidomimetic-resin with Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n4\n/PhSiH\n3\n. The resulting groups are then condensed to form a lactam bridge using a condensation reagent such as PyBOP, HBTU, TBTU, TATU, or DIC/HOBt in the presence of a base such as DIPEA or NMM.\n\n\nAlternatively, Nde (1-(4-nitro-1,3-dioxo-indan-2-ylidene)ethyl) or ivDde (1-(4,4-dimethyl-2-6-dioxo-cyclohexylidene)-3-methyl-butyl) can be employed as the side chain amino protecting group and side chain and ODmab ester (4-(N(1(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)-3-methylbutyl)amino)benzyl ester) as the side chain carboxylic acid protecting group. Both of these groups can be removed by treatment of the peptide-resin with 2% hydrazine in DMF. In yet other aspect, the amino side chain functionality can be protected with Mtt (4-methyl trityl) and the carboxylic side chain functionality can be protected with OPip ester (phenyl isopropyl ester), both of which are removed selectively by treating the peptide resin with 1% TFA in DCM.\n\n\nFollowing cleavage of peptides from the solid phase following their synthesis, the peptide can be purified by any number of methods, such as reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), using a suitable column, such as a C\n18 \ncolumn. Other methods of separation or purification, such as methods based on the size or charge of the peptide, can also be employed. Once purified, the peptide can be characterized by any number of methods, such as high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC), amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and the like.\n\n\nCertain compounds of the invention, where the surrogate of formula I is bound to resin or other peptide solid support and is at the C-terminal position, may be synthesized by means of the following scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurrogate (7) is prepared by the scheme of method A above, or any alternative method. Fmoc protected Sieber amide resin was treated by swelling the resin in a 1:1 mixture of dimethylformamide and dichloromethane for 45 minutes, followed by filtering and washing with dimethylformamide. The washed resin is then deprotected with 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide for 15 minutes, filtered, and washed with dimethylformamide.\n\n\nA solution of Fmoc-protected surrogate (7) in dimethylformamide is added to the deprotected Sieber amide resin as prepared above, followed by solid PyBop and diisopropylethylamine, followed by additional dimethylformamide. The mixture is agitated overnight with nitrogen bubbling. The resin is filtered and washed with dimethylformamide, capped with capping solution consisting of a 3:2:1 solution of dimethylformamide:acetic anhydride:pyridine for 30 minutes, filtered, and washed with dimethylformamide to provide surrogate (7) complexed to resin.\n\n\nThe resulting Fmoc-protected surrogate (7) complexed to resin is deprotected with 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide for 15 minutes, filtered, and washed with dimethylformamide to yield surrogate (7) complexed to resin. A solution of the desired Fmoc-AA-OH (4 eq, where AA is any desired amino acid) in dimethylformamide is added to surrogate (7) complexed to resin, followed by a solution of HCTU (60 mmol, 4 eq), and diisopropylethylamine (120 mmol, 8 eq) in DMF and coupled overnight with nitrogen bubbling. The resulting Fmoc-AA-surrogate (7)-resin is isolated by filtration and washed with dimethylformamide. In order to ensure complete coupling, the product can be again treated with a solution of Fmoc-AA-OH as above overnight with nitrogen bubbling. The resulting resin is filtered and washed with dimethylformamide.\n\n\nThe resulting Fmoc-AA-surrogate (7)-resin is then capped with capping solution as above for 30 minutes. The resin is then filtered, washed with dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, MeOH, and diethyl ether, and then dried under vacuum.\n\n\nThereafter each succeeding amino acid is coupled using conventional peptide coupling methods.\n\n\nOptional PEGylation of compounds made employing a surrogate of formula I may be performed, including by the methods described below.\n\n\nPEGylation of reactive amine groups, such as lysine or ornithine side chains, an omega amino aliphatic in the N-terminal position, or an amine group of a surrogate of formula I in the C-terminal position, is accomplished by dissolving 0.005 mmol purified compound in 2 mL of dimethylsulfoxide, followed by the addition of 55.5 mg (0.011 mmol, 2 eq) of PEG-5K-OSu (5,000 Da MW methoxy-PEG with a succinimidyl propionate reactive group), with 17.7 μL (0.13 mmol, 20 eq) of triethyl amine then added, with the solution stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. Excess PEG-5K-OSu is quenched by the addition of 7 μL (0.111 mmol, 10 eq) of ethanol amine, and the reaction stirred overnight.\n\n\nPEGylation of reactive carboxyl groups, such as Asp or Glu side chains or a terminal carboxyl on a compound on either a terminal amino acid residue or a terminal surrogate of formula I, is accomplished by coupling PEG-NH\n2 \n(PEG-amine), to the peptidomimetic containing a carboxylate group in the side chain of Asp or Glu or at the C-terminus. The peptidomimetic (0.005 mmol) is dissolved in DMSO (2 mL), followed by the addition of 55.5 mg (0.011 mmol, 2 eq) of PEG-NH\n2 \nand HOBt (0.01 mmol). The coupling is started by the addition of 0.0055 mmole of coupling reagent N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDAC). The slightly cloudy solution stirred at room temperature overnight. The PEGylated peptidomimetic is then purified by HPLC.\n\n\nPEGylation of reactive thiol groups, such as Cys or Hcys side chains or a thiol group in R\n1 \nof the surrogate of formula I, is accomplished by treating the peptidomimetic in DMSO with PEG-methyl-maleimide reagent (SunBio, Orinda, Calif.) overnight. The PEGylated peptidomimetic is then purified by HPLC.\n\n\nFollowing PEGylation, the resulting crude peptidomimetic mixture is purified by HPLC, yielding a PEG derivatized peptidomimetic including one or more amino acid surrogates.\n\n\nIn related aspects, hydroxyethyl starch (HES), and generally hydroxyalkyl starch (HAS), may be employed as a prosthetic group, rather than PEG, and similarly serves as a macromolecular carrier. Methods of use of HES and HAS for conjugation of drug are described in WO1999/042139; EP1476470, US2005/0063943 and US 2007/0134197, among others, and are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nIn addition, Fc fragments of immunoglobulin, such as IgG, can also be employed as a macromolecular carrier. A method of preparing this macromolecule and its conjugation to biologically active groups and drugs is described in WO2005/047334, incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe PEG, HES, HAS and Fc conjugation is employed to improve the in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of the peptidomimetics of this invention by improving their in vivo stability and half lives.\n\n\n8.

A competitive inhibition binding assay was performed using membrane homogenates prepared from HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC4-R, hMC3-R, or hMC5-R, and from B-16 mouse melanoma cells (containing endogenous MC1-R). In some instances, HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC1-R were employed. In the examples that follow, all MC3-R, MC4-R and MC5-R values are for human recombinant receptors. MC1-R values are for B-16 mouse melanoma cells, unless the heading is “hMC1-R”, in which case the value is for human recombinant MC1-R. Assays were performed in 96 well GF/B Millipore multiscreen filtration plates (MAFB NOB10) pre-coated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V). Membrane homogenates were incubated with 0.2 nM (for hMC4-R) 0.4 nM (for MC3-R and MC5-R) or 0.1 nM (for mouse B16 MC1-R or hMC1-R) [I\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH (Perkin Elmer) and increasing concentrations of test peptidomimetics in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) with 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.3 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After incubation for 60 minutes at 37° C., the assay mixture was filtered and the membranes washed three times with ice-cold buffer. Filters were dried and counted in a gamma counter for bound radioactivity. Non-specific binding was measured by inhibition of binding of [I\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH in the presence of 1 μM NDP-α-MSH. Maximal specific binding (100%) was defined as the difference in radioactivity (cpm) bound to cell membranes in the absence and presence of 1 μM NDP-α-MSH. Radioactivity (cpm) obtained in the presence of test compounds was normalized with respect to 100% specific binding to determine the percent inhibition of [I\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH binding. Each assay was conducted in triplicate and the actual mean values are described, with results less than 0% reported as 0%. Ki values for test peptidomimetics were determined using Graph-Pad Prism® curve-fitting software.\n\n\nCompetitive binding assay using [I\n125\n]-AgRP (83-132). Competitive binding studies using [I\n125\n]-AgRP (83-132) were carried out using membrane homogenates isolated from cells that express hMC4-R. The assays were performed in 96-well GF/B Millipore multiscreen filtration plates (MAFB NOB10) pre-coated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V). The assay mixture contained 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) with 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.3 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, membrane homogenates, radioligand [I\n125\n]-AgRP (83-132) (Perkin Elmer) and increasing concentrations of peptidomimetics in a total volume of 200 μL. Binding was measured at radioligand concentrations of 0.2 nM. After incubating for 1 hour at 37° C., the reaction mixture was filtered and washed with assay buffer containing 500 mM NaCl. The dried discs were punched out from the plate and counted on a gamma counter. The total binding of the radioligand did not exceed 10% of the counts added to the reaction mixture. Ki values for test peptidomimetics were determined using Graph-Pad Prism® curve-fitting software.\n\n\nAssay for agonist activity. Accumulation of intracellular cAMP was examined as a measure of the ability of the test peptidomimetics to elicit a functional response in HEK-293 cells that express MC4-R. Confluent HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC4-R were detached from culture plates by incubation in enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer. Dispersed cells were suspended in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM glutamine, 0.5% albumin and 0.3 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 0.5×10\n5 \ncells per well and pre-incubated for 30 minutes. Cells were exposed for 1 hour at 37° C. to test peptidomimetics dissolved in DMSO (final DMSO concentration of 1%) at a concentration range of 0.05-5000 nM in a total assay volume of 200 μL. NDP-α-MSH was used as the reference agonist. At the end of the incubation period, cells were disrupted by the addition of 50 μL of lysis buffer (cAMP EIA kit, Amersham) followed by vigorous pipetting. Levels of cAMP in the lysates were determined using a cAMP EIA kit (Amersham). Data analysis was performed by nonlinear regression analysis with Graph-Pad Prism® software. The maximum efficacies of the test peptidomimetics were compared to that achieved by the reference melanocortin agonist NDP-αMSH.\n\n\n9. In Vivo Animal Tests for Peptidomimetics\n\n\nFood intake after IN and IP dosing. Changes in food intake are evaluated for selected compounds. Male C57BL/6 mice are obtained from Jackson labs (Bar Harbor, Me.). Animals are individually housed in conventional plexiglass hanging cages and maintained on a controlled 12 hour on/off light cycle. Water and pelleted (Harlan Teklad 2018 18% Protein Rodent Diet) food is provided ad libitum. The mice are dosed IP (by intraperitoneal injection) after a 24 hour fast or IN (by intranasal administration) with vehicle or selected peptidomimetics (0.1-3 mg/kg, and in some cases up to 10 mg/kg). All animals are dosed once a day (or up to four consecutive days) at the start of the “lights off” period. The changes in food intake weight for the 4 hour and 20 hour period after dosing relative to control animals administered vehicle is determined.\n\n\nInduction of Penile Erection. The ability of peptidomimetics of this invention to induce penile erection (PE) in male rats are evaluated with selected peptidomimetics. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-250 g are kept on a 12 hour on/off light cycle with food and water ad libitum. All behavioral studies are performed between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Groups of 4-8 rats are administered peptidomimietics at a variety of doses via an intravenous (IV) route, and may alternatively be administered peptidomimetics by an intracerebroventricular (ICV) route. Immediately after treatment, rats are placed into individual polystyrene cages (27 cm long, 16 cm wide, and 25 cm high) for behavioral observation. Rats administered peptidomimetics by an IV route are observed for one hour, and the number of yawns, grooming bouts and PEs are recorded in 10-minute bins. For rats administered peptidomimietics by an ICV routes, rats are observed for two hours.\n\n\n10. Combination Therapy with Peptidomimetics\n\n\nCombination Therapy for Sexual Dysfunction.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention, peptidomimetics of the invention are used in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a cyclic-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor or an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist. The teachings and disclosure of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/139,730, filed May 26, 2005, and entitled “Multiple Agent Therapy for Sexual Dysfunction”, are incorporated here by reference as if set forth in full.\n\n\nThe present invention thus provides methods of treating sexual dysfunction, the methods comprising the step of administering to the patient having or at risk of having sexual dysfunction a therapeutically effective amount of a peptidomimetics of this invention in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a second sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent. The peptidomimetics of this invention may be administered simultaneously with, prior to or subsequent to administration with a therapeutically effective amount of a second sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent. Preferably the peptidomimetics of this invention is administered within one hour, preferably within less than one-half hour, of administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a second sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent. However, for certain forms of combination therapy, such as for example in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a hormone or hormone-related sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent, the hormone or hormone-related sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent may be administered on an independent schedule, such that there is no set or specific temporal relationship between administration of the peptidomimetics of this invention and the hormone or hormone-related sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent. Thus, for example, the hormone or hormone-related sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent may be administered on a daily or other dose, or by means of patches or other continuous administration schedules, with administration of the peptidomimetics of this invention when desired or needed by the patient.\n\n\nThe present invention thus provides methods of treating sexual dysfunction, the methods comprising the step of administering to a patient having or at risk of having sexual dysfunction a therapeutically effective amount of a peptidomimetics of this invention in combination with another compound that is useful in the treatment of sexual dysfunction.

In an especially preferred embodiment of combination therapy the sexual dysfunction is erectile dysfunction.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a peptidomimetic of this invention and a second compound useful for the treatment of sexual dysfunction. In an embodiment of the composition, the additional compounds useful for the treatment of sexual dysfunction are preferably selected from but not limited to the group consisting of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor; a cyclic-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor; prostaglandins; apomorphine; oxytocin modulators; α-adrenergic antagonists; androgens; selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs); buproprion; vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP); neutral endopeptidase inhibitors (NEP); and neuropeptide Y receptor antagonists (NPY).\n\n\nIn an embodiment of the method and composition, the second sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent is testosterone.\n\n\nIn another embodiment of combination therapy, the second sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent is a type V phosphodiesterase (PDE-5) inhibitor. For example, the PDE-5 inhibitor may be Viagra®, a brand of sildenafil, Levitra®, a brand of monohydrochloride salt of vardenafil, or Cialis®, a brand of tadalafil. Other PDE-5 inhibitors are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/139,730, filed May 26, 2005, and entitled “Multiple Agent Therapy for Sexual Dysfunction”, incorporated here by reference.\n\n\nIn another embodiment of the composition above, the second compound useful for the treatment of sexual dysfunction is an estrogen agonist/antagonist. In one embodiment, the estrogen agonist/antagonist is (−)-cis-6-phenyl-5-[-4-(2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-ethoxy)-phenyl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-napththalene-2-ol (also known as lasofoxifene) or an optical or geometric isomer thereof; a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, N-oxide, ester, quaternary ammonium salt; or a prodrug thereof.

It is also possible and contemplated to use peptidomimetics of this invention in combination with other drugs or agents for treatment of various weight and feeding-related disorders. Peptidomimetics of this invention may be employed for decreasing food intake and/or body weight in combination with any other agent or drug heretofore employed as a diet aid, or for decreasing food intake and/or body weight. Peptidomimetics of this invention may further be employed for increasing food intake and/or body weight in combination with any other agent or drug heretofore employed for increasing food intake and/or body weight.\n\n\nDrugs that reduce energy intake include, in part, various pharmacological agents, referred to as anorectic drugs, which are used as adjuncts to behavioral therapy in weight reduction programs. Classes of anorectic drugs include, but are not limited to, noradrenergic and serotonergic agents. Noradrenergic medications may be described as those medications generally preserving the anorectic effects of amphetamines but with weaker stimulant activity. The noradrenergic drugs, except phenylpropanolamine, generally act through a centrally mediated pathway in the hypothalamus that causes anorexia. Phenylpropanolamine, a racemic mixture of norephedrine esters, causes a release of norepinephrine throughout the body and stimulates hypothalamic adrenoreceptors to reduce appetite.\n\n\nSuitable noradrenergic agents include, but are not limited to, diethylpropion such as TENUATE™ (1-propanone, 2-(diethylamino)-1-phenyl-, hydrochloride) commercially available from Merrell; mazindol (or 5-(p-chlorophenyl)-2,5-dihydro-3H-imidazo[2,1-a]isoindol-5-ol) such as SANOREX™ commercially available from Novartis or MAZANOR™ commercially available from Wyeth Ayerst; phenylpropanolamine (or Benzenemethanol, alpha-(1-aminoethyl)-, hydrochloride); phentermine (or Phenol, 3-[[4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)ethyl](4-methylphenyl)amino], monohydrochloride) such as ADIPEX-P™ commercially available from Lemmon, FASTIN™ commercially available from Smith-Kline Beecham and Ionamin™ commercially available from Medeva; phendimetrazine (or (2S,3S)-3,4-Dimethyl-2-phenylmorpholine L-(+)-tartrate (1:1)) such as METRA™ commercially available from Forest, PLEGINE™ commercially available from Wyeth-Ayerst; PRELU-2™ commercially available from Boehringer Ingelheim, and STATOBEX™ commercially available from Lemmon; phendamine tartrate such as THEPHORIN™ (2,3,4,9-Tetrahydro-2-methyl-9-phenyl-1H-indenol[2,1-c]pyridine L-(+)-tartrate (1:1)) commercially available from Hoffmann-LaRoche; methamphetamine such as DESOXYN™ Tablets ((S)—N, (alpha)-dimethylbenzeneethanamine hydrochloride) commercially available from Abbott; and phendimetrazine tartrate such as BONTRIL™ Slow-Release Capsules (-3,4-Dimethyl-2-phenylmorpholine Tartrate) commercially available from Amarin.\n\n\nSuitable serotonergic agents include, but are not limited to, sibutramine such as MERIDIA™ capsules (a racemic mixture of the (+) and (−) enantiomers of cyclobutanemethanamine, 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-N,N-dimethyl-(alpha)-(2-methylpropyl)-, hydrochloride, monohydrate) commercially available from Knoll, fenfluramine such as Pondimin™ (Benzeneethanamine, N-ethyl-alpha-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-, hydrochloride) commercially available from Robbins; dexfenfluramine such as Redux™ (Benzeneethanamine, N-ethyl-alpha-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-, hydrochloride) commercially available from Interneuron. Fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine stimulate release of serotonin and inhibit its reuptake. Sibutramine inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, but does not stimulate secretion of serotonin.\n\n\nOther serotonergic agents useful with the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, certain auoretic gene 5HT1a inhibitors (brain, serotonin) such as carbidopa and benserazide as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,699 which is incorporated herein by reference; and certain neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors including fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxtine, sertraline and other useful compounds as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,805 which is incorporated herein by reference. Other potential agents that may be employed include, for example, 5HT2c agonists.\n\n\nOther useful compounds for reducing energy intake include, but are not limited to, certain aryl-substituted cyclobutylalkylamines as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,127,424 which is incorporated herein by reference; certain trifluoromethylthiophenylethylamine derivatives as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,923 which is incorporated herein by reference; certain compounds as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,699 which is incorporated herein by reference; certain kainite or AMPA receptor antagonists as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,191,117 which is incorporated herein by reference; certain neuropeptide receptor subtype 5 as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,140,354 which is incorporated herein by reference; and certain alpha-blocking agents as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,239,763 which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nMoreover, several peptides and hormones regulate feeding behavior. For example, cholecystokinin and serotonin act to decrease appetite and food intake. Leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells, controls food intake and energy expenditure. In obese persons who are losing weight without medications, a decrease in weight is associated with a decrease in circulating levels of leptin, suggesting its role in weight homeostasis. Obese patients with high leptin levels are thought to have peripheral leptin resistance secondary to the down-regulation of leptin receptors. Non-limiting examples of useful compounds affecting feeding behavior include certain leptin-lipolysis stimulated receptors as disclosed by WO 01/21647 which is incorporated herein by reference; certain phosphodiesterase enzyme inhibitors as disclosed by WO 01/35970 which is incorporated herein by reference; certain compounds having nucleotide sequences of the mahogany gene as disclosed by WO 00/05373 which is incorporated herein by reference; and certain sapogenin compounds as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,680,289 which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nOther useful compounds include certain gamma peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) agonists as disclosed by WO 01/30343 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,656 which are incorporated herein by reference and certain polypeptides such as fibroblast growth factor-10 polypeptides as disclosed by WO 01/18210 which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nMoreover, monoamine oxidase inhibitors that decrease energy intake or increase energy expenditure are useful with the practice of the present invention. Suitable, but non-limiting, examples of monoamine oxidase inhibitors include befloxatone, moclobemide, brofaromine, phenoxathine, esuprone, befol, toloxatone, pirlindol, amiflamine, sercloremine, bazinaprine, lazabemide, milacemide, caroxazone and other certain compounds as disclosed by WO 01/12176 which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nCertain compounds that increase lipid metabolism are also useful with the practice of the present invention. Such compounds include, but are not limited to, evodiamine compounds as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,831 which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nNutrient partitioning agents and digestive inhibitors are another strategy in the treatment of obesity by interfering with the breakdown, digestion or absorption of dietary fat in the gastrointestinal tract. Gastric and pancreatic lipases aid in the digestion of dietary triglycerides by forming them into free fatty acids that are then absorbed in the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzymes leads to inhibition of the digestion of dietary triglycerides. Non-limiting examples include a lipase inhibitor, orlistat, such as XENICAL™ capsules ((S)-2-formylamino-4-methyl-pentanoic acid (S)-1-[[(2S,3S)-3-hexyl-4-oxo-2-oxetanyl]methyl]-dodecyl ester) commercially available from Roche Laboratories and certain benzoxazinone compounds as described by WO 00/40247 which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nAgents that increase energy expenditure are also referred to as thermogenic medications. Non-limiting examples of suitable thermogenic medications include xanthines, such as caffeine and theophylline, selective β-3-adrenergic agonists, for example certain compounds in U.S. Pat. No. 4,626,549 which is incorporated by reference herein, and α-2-adrenergic and growth hormones compounds as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,937,267 and 5,120,713 which are incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\nGenerally, a total dosage of the above-described obesity control agents or medications, when used in combination with a peptidomimetic of this invention can range from 0.1 to 3,000 mg/day, preferably from about 1 to 1,000 mg/day and more preferably from about 1 to 200 mg/day in single or 2-4 divided doses. The exact dose, however, is determined by the attending clinician and is dependent on such factors as the potency of the compound administered, the age, weight, condition and response of the patient.\n\n\nAgents or drugs employed for increasing food intake and/or body weight include appetite stimulants such as megestrol acetate, adrenocorticoids such as prednisolone and dexamethasone, cyproheptidine, serotonergic drugs such as fenfluramine, neuropeptide Y, and androgen antagonists such as flutamide, nilutamide, and zanoterone.\n\n\n11. Illustrative Peptidomimetics of the Invention\n\n\nAs may be seen from the foregoing, the peptidomimetics of the invention consist of a large group that nonetheless is characterized by common elements, including an element based upon, or derived from, the melanocortin sequences His-Phe-Arg-Trp (SEQ ID NO:1) or His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp. The minimum total number of amino acid residues and surrogates in a peptidomimetic of the invention is four. While there is no maximum as such, in general the total number of amino acid residues and surrogates in a peptidomimetic of the invention will not exceed about ten. The peptidomimetics may be linear or cyclic. If cyclic, typically the peptidomimetics of the invention have at least six amino acid residues and surrogates, but five is possible if the peptidomimetics is cyclized through a C-terminus group or an N-terminus group.\n\n\nIn one aspect there are provided linear peptidomimetics, such as the following:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nEven in the foregoing, it is possible and contemplated within the invention to make substitutions. By way of example and not limitation, the following substitutions are possible:\n\n\n\nFor His in position 1, there may be substituted an amino acid residue with an amino acid side chain moiety comprising an alkyl group, aryl group or a heteroaryl group, optionally fused to an aryl group, heteroaryl group, cycloalkyl group or heterocycloalkyl group, and optionally with one or two ring substituents, and when one or both ring substitutents are present, the substituents are the same or different and independently hydroxyl, halogen, halo-alkyl, halo-aryl, alkyl, or aryl groups attached directly or through an ether linkage, or is an amino acid residue of the formulas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein:\n\n\nQ\n1\n, Q\n2 \nand Q\n3 \nare each independently CH\n2\n, CH, C═O, NH, N, S or O;\n\n\nR\n13a \nis not present if the y of (Q\n1\n)\ny \nis 0 or if Q\n1 \nis CH\n2\n, C═O, NH, N with a double bond, S, or O, and otherwise R\n13a \nis a hydroxyl group, halogen group, or linear or branched C\n1 \nto C\n7 \nalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkene, alkenyl, or aralkyl chain, in each instance attached directly or through an ether linkage to Q\n1\n, on the proviso that R\n13a \nmay form an aryl or heteroaryl with R\n13b\n;\n\n\nR\n13b \nis not present if Q\n2 \nis CH\n2\n, C═O, NH, N with a double bond, S, or O, and otherwise R\n13b \nis a hydroxyl group, halogen group, or linear or branched C\n1 \nto C\n7 \nalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkene, alkenyl, or aralkyl chain, in each instance attached directly or through an ether linkage to Q\n2\n, on the proviso that R\n13b \nmay form an aryl or heteroaryl with either R\n13a \nor R\n13c\n;\n\n\nR\n13c \nis not present if the y of (Q\n3\n)\ny \nis 0 or if Q\n3 \nis CH\n2\n, C═O, NH, N with a double bond, S, or O, and otherwise R\n13c \nis a hydroxyl group, halogen group, or linear or branched C\n1 \nto C\n7 \nalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkene, alkenyl, or aralkyl chain, in each instance attached directly or through an ether linkage to Q\n3\n, on the proviso that R\n13c \nmay form an aryl or heteroaryl with R\n13b\n; and\n\n\ny is in each instance independently 0 or 1;\n\n\nor S\n2 \nis a surrogate of formula I wherein R\n1 \nis H or comprises alkyl, an aryl group or a heteroaryl group, optionally fused to an aryl group, heteroaryl group, cycloalkyl group or heterocycloalkyl group, and optionally with one or two ring substituents, and when one or both ring substitutents are present, the substituents are the same or different and independently hydroxyl, halogen, halo-alkyl, halo-aryl, alkyl, or aryl groups attached directly or through an ether linkage;\n\n\nFor D-Phe in position 2, there may be substituted an amino acid residue with an amino acid side chain moiety comprising phenyl, 1-naphthyl, or 2-naphthyl, optionally with one or two ring substituents, and when one or both ring substitutents are present, the substituents are the same or different and independently hydroxyl, halogen, halo-alkyl, halo-aryl, alkyl, or aryl groups attached directly or through an ether linkage, including but not limited to L- or D-Phe with any known substitutent, L- or D-NaI ′1 or L- or D-NaI ′2;\n\n\nFor Arg in position 3, there may be substituted an amino acid residue with an amino acid side chain moiety comprising an amino acid side chain moiety comprising a heteroatom unit with at least one cationic center, hydrogen bond donor or hydrogen bond acceptor wherein at least one heteroatom is nitrogen or oxygen; and\n\n\nFor Trp in position 4, there may be substituted an amino acid residue with an amino acid side chain moiety comprising an aryl group, a cycloalkyl group, two fused aryl groups, two aryl groups joined by a bond or —O—, or a heteroaryl group fused with a heteroaryl, aryl, cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl group, optionally with one or two ring substituents, and when one or both ring substitutents are present, the substituents are the same or different and independently hydroxyl, halogen, halo-alkyl, halo-aryl, alkyl, or aryl groups attached directly or through an ether linkage.\n\n\nIt will readily be appreciated that similar peptidomimetics can be made that include more than three amino acid residues and a surrogate of formula I. By way of example, peptidomimetics may include four, five, six, seven, eight or nine amino acid residues and a surrogate of formula I. It is also contemplated that peptidomimetics may include more than one surrogate of formula I, such as including two surrogates of formula I, preferably where the R\n1 \ngroups of the surrogates are different. It will further readily be appreciated that peptidomimetics may be cyclic as well as linear, and in particular that peptidomimetics with at least about five, six, seven, eight or nine amino acid residues and a surrogate of formula I may be cyclized. The cyclic peptidomimetics may be have a cyclic bond that includes an N-terminus group, a C-terminus group, an R\n1 \ngroup of a surrogate of formula I, or one or two amino acid side chain moieties. The cyclic bond may include a covalent bond such as an amide, disulfide, thioether, Schiff base, reduced Schiff base, imide, secondary amine, carbonyl, urea, hydrazone or oxime bond.\n\n\nIt is also possible and contemplated to make peptidomimetics containing two surrogates of formula I. By way of example, and not limitation, the following peptidomimetics are included within the invention:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nand the like, and further that such peptidomimetics may be cyclic as well as linear, and in particular that peptidomimetics with at least about four, five, six, seven or eight amino acid residues and two surrogates of formula I may be cyclized. The cyclic peptidomimetics may be have a cyclic bond that includes an N-terminus group, a C-terminus group, an R\n1 \ngroup of a surrogate of formula I, or one or two amino acid side chain moieties. The cyclic bond may include a covalent bond such as an amide, disulfide, thioether, Schiff base, reduced Schiff base, imide, secondary amine, carbonyl, urea, hydrazone or oxime bond. It is thus possible, by way of example, to immediately envision any of the peptidomimetics given in the Examples as having two surrogates, by substituting one amino acid residue in any of the peptidomimetics by a surrogate.\n\n\n\n12. Examples\n\n\nThe invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.\n\n\nPeptidomimetic 12.1: A peptidomimetic was synthesized utilizing an N-terminus surrogate of the formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhich was made by the method of Scheme C.

Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel analogues of neuropeptide Y, pharmaceutical compositions containing the same, pharmaceutical formulations containing the same, and method of treating diseases or conditions mediated by neuropeptide Y-receptor binding. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel analogues of neuropeptide Y having at least one unnatural amino acid substitution, such as 4Hyp at position 34, that selectively bind to the neuropeptide Y1 receptor subtype compared to the neuropeptide Y2 receptor subtype.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nNeuropeptide Y (“NPY”), a 36 amino acid peptide neurotransmitter, is a member of the pancreatic family of peptides and shares significant sequence homology with pancreatic polypeptide and peptide YY. Human neuropeptide Y (“hNPY”) has the sequence: H-Tyr-Pro-Ser-Lys-Pro-Asp-Asn-Pro-Gly-Glu-Asp-Ala-Pro-Ala-Glu-Asp-Met-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Ser-Ala-Leu-Arg-His-Tyr-Ile-Asn-Leu-Ile-Thr-Arg-Gln-Arg-Tyr-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:1). NPY was discovered, isolated and sequenced from porcine brain and was named “neuropeptide Y” due to its isolation from neural tissue and the presence of tyrosine as both the amino and carboxy terminal amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNPY and the other members of its family of peptides all feature a tertiary structure consisting of an N-terminal polyproline helix and an amphiphilic α-helix, connected with a β-turn, creating a hairpin-like loop, which is sometimes referred to as the “pancreatic polypeptide fold.” The helices are kept together by hydrophobic interactions. The amidated C-terminal end projects away from the hairpin loop.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubsequent to its discovery, NPY was identified as being the most abundant peptide in the central nervous system with widespread distribution including the cortex, brainstem, hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and thalamus, as well as being present in the peripheral nervous system in sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNPY seems to fulfill the main neurotransmitter criteria, since it is stored in synaptic granules, is released upon electrical nerve stimulation, and acts at specific receptors. It is clear that NPY is an important messenger in its own right, probably in the brain, where NPY potently inhibits the activity of adenylate cyclase and induces an increase in the intracellular levels of calcium. Central injection of NPY results in blood pressure changes, increased feeding, increased fat storage, elevated blood sugar and insulin, decreased locomotor activity, reduced body temperature, and catalepsy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNPY appears to interact with a family of closely related receptors. These receptors are generally classified into several subtypes based upon the ability of different tissues and receptors to bind different fragments of neuropeptide Y and the closely related PYY. The Y1 receptor subtype (“NPY-Y1 receptor”) appears to be the major vascular NPY receptor. The Y2 receptor subtype (“NPY-Y2 receptor”) can also occur postjunctionally on vascular smooth muscle. The Y3 receptor subtype (“NPY-Y3 receptor”) appears to be NPY-specific, not binding PYY. This receptor is likely to be present in the adrenal tissues, medulla, heart, and brain stem, among other areas. For a review of neuropeptide Y and neuropeptide Y receptors, see, e.g., C. Wahlestedt and D. Reis, Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology, 33:309-352 (1993). Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) Publication No. WO 95/00161 describes a series of NPY antagonists and agonists for controlling biological activities such as obesity and cardiovascular function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEuropean Pat. No. 0759441 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,337 report that physiological disorders related to an excess of neuropeptide Y include: disorders or diseases pertaining to the heart, blood vessels or the renal system, such as vasospasm, heart failure, shock, cardiac hypertrophy, increased blood pressure, angina, myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, arrhythmia, peripheral vascular disease, and abnormal renal conditions such as impaired flow of fluid, abnormal mass transport, or renal failure; conditions related to increased sympathetic nerve activity for example, during or after coronary artery surgery, and operations and surgery in the gastrointestinal tract; cerebral diseases and diseases related to the central nervous system, such as cerebral infarction, neurodegeneration, epilepsy, stroke, and conditions related to stroke, cerebral vasospasm and hemorrhage, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and dementia; conditions related to pain or nociception; diseases related to abnormal gastrointenstinal motility and secretion, such as different forms of ileus, urinary incontinence, and Crohn's disease; abnormal drink and food intake disorders, such as anorexia and metabolic disorders; diseases related to sexual dysfunction and reproductive disorders; conditions or disorders associated with inflammation; respiratory diseases, such as asthma and conditions related to asthma and bronchoconstriction; and diseases related to abnormal hormone release, such as leutinizing hormone, growth hormone, insulin, and prolactin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT Publication No. WO 02/43776 by Reubi reports on the use of compounds that bind the NPY-Y1 receptor for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the diagnosis or treatment of tumors expressing the NPY-Y1 receptor, in particular breast cancer, ovarian cancer and glioblastoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are numerous patents and patent publications that disclose certain NPY analogues and uses thereof, such as U.S. Pat. No. 5,026,685, U.S. Pat. No. 5,328,899, U.S. Pat. No. 6,511,984, PCT Publication No. WO 02/43776, PCT Publication No. WO2007/039318, etc. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there remains a continuing need for NPY analogues having improved potency and/or selectivity and/or in vivo or in vitro characteristics.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides peptide variants of hNPY of the following formula

\n \nAs used herein the term “amino acid” refers to any natural or unnatural amino acid, including but not limited to α-amino acids, β-amino acids, or γ-amino acids, and may be either D- or L-amino acid unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith the exception of the N-terminal amino acid, all amino acid abbreviations (e.g., Ala) in this disclosure have the structure —NH—C(R)(R′)—CO—,

The C-terminal portion of the peptide (residues 18-36) was synthesized on ABI 433A Peptide Synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., USA) at the 1.0 mmole scale. The reaction vessel containing 1.37 g of 0.73 mmol/Rink Amide MBHA resin (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA) was placed in a reaction vessel. The resin was then treated with 10 ml of NMP for 15 minutes to swell the resin. The ABI FastMoc 1.0® protocol was used to generate the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach cycle comprised of deblocking the N-terminal Fmoc using 20% piperidine followed by extensive NMP washing. Pre-packaged 1.0 mmole cartridges of each amino acid were then dissolved in 0.45M HOBT/HBTU. After enough time was allotted for dissolution of the amino acid, it was automatically transferred to the activation vessel. Two more 1.0 mmole amino acid cartridges were dissolved and transferred to the activation vessel for a total of 3 equivalents of amino acid used per coupling step. DIPEA, 3 ml of a 2M solution, was then introduced to the activation vessel for a total of 6 eq. DIPEA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis entire mixture was then introduced to the resin and allowed to mix for 15 minutes. The reaction vessel was emptied, washed with NMP and then followed by a second coupling step. Following the second coupling step, the resin was again thoroughly washed. Each amino acid was double-coupled in a similar fashion. Following the coupling step of the first Tyr residue, for each of the next 4 coupling steps, and each Arg coupling step, the resin was capped with 5 ml of capping solution (0.5M acetic anhydride/0.13M DIPEA/0.01M HOBT) to block any unacylated resin sites. The following amino acid cartridges were used for the coupling steps: Cycle 1) Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH; Cycle 2) Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH; Cycle 3) Fmoc-4Hyp-OH; Cycle 4) Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH; Cycle 5) Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-OH; Cycle 6) Fmoc-Ile-OH; Cycle 7) Fmoc-Leu-OH; Cycle 8) Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH; Cycle 9) Fmoc-Ile-OH; Cycle 10) Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH; Cycle 11) Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH; Cycle 12) Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH; Cycle 13) Fmoc-Leu-OH; Cycle 14) Fmoc-Ala-OH; Cycle 15) Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-OH; Cycle 16) Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH; Cycle 17) Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH; Cycle 18) Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH; and Cycle 19) Fmoc-Ala-OH. Following the last coupling cycle, the resin was washed with NMP, followed by standard N-terminal Fmoc deblocking, washed with NMP followed by DCM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing assembly of the C-terminal portion of the peptide backbone (residues 18-36), only one tenth of the resin (0.1 mmole) was used to construct the N-terminal portion of the peptide, with the remainder saved. The N-terminal portion of the titled peptide (residues 1-17) was constructed using microwave-assisted Fmoc Chemistry on Liberty Peptide Synthesizer (CEM, Matthews, N.C., USA) at the 0.1 mmole scale. The resin from the previous synthesis was placed in a 50 ml conical tube along with 15 ml of DMF and loaded onto a resin position on the synthesizer. The resin was then quantitatively transferred to the reaction vessel via the automated process. The standard Liberty synthesis protocol for 0.1 mmole scale synthesis was used. This protocol involves deprotecting the N-terminal Fmoc moiety via an initial treatment with 7 ml of 20% piperidine, containing 0.1M HOBT, in DMF. The initial deprotection step was for 30 seconds with microwave power (45 watts, maximum temperature of 75° C.), and nitrogen bubbling (3 seconds on/7 seconds off). The reaction vessel was then drained and a second piperidine treatment, identical to the first treatment, except that it was for a 3-minute duration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resin was then drained and thoroughly washed with DMF several times. The protected amino acid, Fmoc-Met-OH, prepared as 0.2M stock solution in DMF, was then added (2.5 ml, 5 equivalents), followed by 1.0 ml of 0.45M (4.5 eq.) HBTU in DMF. This was followed by the addition of 0.5 ml of 2M (10 eq.) DIPEA in NMP. The coupling step was performed for 5 minutes using 20 watts of microwave power, a maximum temperature of 75° C., and the same rate of nitrogen bubbling. Following the initial coupling step, the reaction vessel was drained to waste and the coupling step repeated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCycle 2 was then initiated similar to Cycle 1. All amino acids were introduced similarly and a double-coupling strategy was employed throughout the entire sequence. Residues 9-10 (Gly-Aib) contained a capping procedure immediately following the coupling step. Capping was performed by adding 7 ml of 0.5M acetic anhydride, containing 0.015M HOBT in NMP, along with 2 ml of the 2M DIPEA solution using a multi-step microwave protocol: 50 watts of power for 30 seconds (65° C. maximum temperature), followed by 30 seconds of microwave power off, followed by a second round of 30 seconds of microwave power on (50 watts), and then again 30 seconds of no microwave power. The resin was then drained and thoroughly washed with DMF. The following amino acids (Advanced Chemtech, Louisville, Ky., USA) were used: Cycle 20) Fmoc-Met-OH; Cycle 21) Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 22) Fmoc-Glu(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 23) Fmoc-Ala-OH; Cycle 24) Fmoc-Pro-OH; Cycle 25) Fmoc-Ala-OH; Cycle 26) Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 27) Fmoc-Aib-OH; Cycle 28) Fmoc-Gly-OH; Cycle 29) Fmoc-Pro-OH; Cycle 30) Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH; Cycle 31) Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 32) Fmoc-Pro-OH; Cycle 33) Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 34) Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-OH; Cycle 35) Fmoc-Pro-OH; Cycle 36) Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the peptide backbone was complete, standard piperidine treatment was used to remove the N-terminal Fmoc group using the standard deprotection procedure described previously. The resin was then thoroughly washed with DMF and then transferred back to the 50 ml conical tube using DMF as the transfer solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resin was deprotected and cleaved from the resin via treatment with 5 ml of the following reagent: 5% TIS, 2% water, 5% (w/v) DTT, and 88% TFA, and allowed to mix for 3.5 hours. The filtrate was collected into 45 ml of cold anhydrous ethyl ether. The precipitate was pelleted for 10 minutes at 3500 RPM in a refrigerated centrifuge. The ether was decanted and the peptide re-suspended in fresh ether. The ether workup was performed a total of 2 times. Following the last ether wash, the peptide was allowed to air dry to remove residual ether. The peptide pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of acetonitrile followed by 8 ml of de-ionized water and allowed to fully dissolve.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide solution was then analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mass analysis employing electrospray ionization identified a main product containing a mass of 4212.1, corresponding to the desired product. Analytical HPLC analysis, employing a 250×4.6 mm C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif., USA) using a gradient of 2-60% acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) over 30 minutes, identified a main product with 45% purity. The crude peptide was then purified on a preparative HPLC equipped with a C18 reverse phase column using a 10-60% acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) over 50 minutes at a 10 ml/min flow rate. The purified product was analyzed by HPLC for purity (>99%) and mass spectrometry (4212.8 da), with the experimental mass corresponding well to the expected mass of 4212.7. The peptide was subsequently lyophilized producing 39 mg of purified product representing a 9% yield.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\n[Aib\n17\n, 4Hyp\n34\n]hNPY(1-36)-NH\n2 \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe titled peptide was assembled using Fmoc-chemistry.

Mass analysis employing electrospray ionization identified a main product containing a mass of 4210.8, corresponding to the desired product. Analytical HPLC analysis, employing a 250×4.6 mm C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif., USA) using a gradient of 2-60% acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) over 30 minutes, identified a main product with 54% purity. The crude peptide was then purified on a preparative HPLC equipped with a C18 reverse phase column using a 10-60% acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) over 50 minutes at a 10 ml/min flow rate. The purified product was analyzed by HPLC for purity (>99%) and mass spectrometry (4210.6 da) with the experimental mass corresponding to the expected mass of 4210.6. The peptide was subsequently lyophilized producing 53 mg of purified product representing a 13% yield.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\n[Aib\n11.17\n, 4Hyp\n34\n]hNPY(1-36)-NH\n2 \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe titled peptide was assembled using Fmoc-chemistry. The C-terminal portion of the peptide (residues 18-36) was synthesized on ABI 433A Peptide Synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., USA) at the 1.0 mmole scale. The reaction vessel containing 1.37 g of 0.73 mmol/Rink Amide MBHA resin (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA) was placed in a reaction vessel. The resin was then treated with 10 ml of NMP for 15 min to swell the resin. The ABI FastMoc 1.0® protocol was used to generate the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach cycle was comprised of deblocking the N-terminal Fmoc using 20% piperidine followed by extensive NMP washing. Pre-packaged 1.0 mmole cartridges of each amino acid were then dissolved in 0.45M HOBT/HBTU. After the amino acid had dissolved, it was automatically transferred to the activation vessel. Two more 1.0 mmole amino acid cartridges were dissolved and transferred to the activation vessel for a total of 3 equivalents of amino acid used per coupling step. DIPEA, 3 ml of a 2M solution, was then introduced to the activation vessel for a total of 6 eq. DIPEA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis entire mixture was then introduced to the resin and allowed to mix for 15 minutes. The reaction vessel was emptied, washed with NMP, and then followed by a second coupling step. Following the second coupling step, the resin was again thoroughly washed. Each amino acid was double-coupled in a similar fashion. Following the coupling step of the first Tyr residue, for each of the next 4 coupling steps and each Arg coupling step, the resin was capped with 5 ml of capping solution (0.5M acetic anhydride/0.13M DIPEA/0.01M HOBT) to block any unacylated resin sites. The following amino acid cartridges were used for the coupling steps: Cycle 1) Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH; Cycle 2) Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH; Cycle 3) Fmoc-4Hyp-OH; Cycle 4) Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH; Cycle 5) Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-OH; Cycle 6) Fmoc-Ile-OH; Cycle 7) Fmoc-Leu-OH; Cycle 8) Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH; Cycle 9) Fmoc-Ile-OH; Cycle 10) Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH; Cycle 11) Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH; Cycle 12) Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH; Cycle 13) Fmoc-Leu-OH; Cycle 14) Fmoc-Ala-OH; Cycle 15) Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-OH; Cycle 16) Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH; Cycle 17) Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH; Cycle 18) Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH; and Cycle 19) Fmoc-Ala-OH. Following the last coupling cycle, the resin was washed with NMP, deblocked by standard N-terminal Fmoc deblocking, and again washed with NMP followed by DCM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing assembly of the C-terminal portion of the peptide backbone (residues 18-36), only one tenth of the resin (0.1 mmole) was used to construct the N-terminal portion of the peptide with the remainder saved. The N-terminal portion of the titled peptide (residues 1-17) was constructed using microwave-assisted Fmoc Chemistry on a Liberty Peptide Synthesizer (CEM, Matthews, N.C., USA) at the 0.1 mmole scale. The resin from the previous synthesis was placed in a 50 ml conical tube along with 15 ml of DMF and loaded onto a resin position on the synthesizer. The resin was then quantitatively transferred to the reaction vessel via the automated process. The standard Liberty synthesis protocol for 0.1 mmole scale synthesis was used. This protocol involves deprotecting the N-terminal Fmoc moiety via an initial treatment with 7 ml of 20% piperidine containing 0.1M HOBT in DMF. The initial deprotection step lasted 30 seconds with microwave power (45 watts, maximum temperature of 75° C.) and nitrogen bubbling (3 seconds on/7 seconds off). The reaction vessel was then drained and a second piperidine treatment, identical to the first treatment except that it was for a 3-minute duration was applied. The resin was then drained and thoroughly washed with DMF several times. The protected amino acid, Fmoc-Aib-OH prepared as 0.2M stock solution in DMF, was then added (2.5 ml, 5 equivalents) followed by 1.0 ml of 0.45M (4.5 eq.) HBTU in DMF. This was followed by the addition of 0.5 ml of 2M (10 eq.) DIPEA in NMP. The coupling step was performed for 5 minutes using 20 watts of microwave power at a maximum temperature of 75° C. and the same rate of nitrogen bubbling. Following the initial coupling step, the reaction vessel was drained to waste and the coupling step repeated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCycle 2 which was similar to Cycle 1 was then initiated. All amino acids were introduced similarly and a double-coupling strategy was employed throughout the entire process. Residues 10-11 and 16-17 (Glu-Aib and Asp-Aib) contained a capping procedure immediately following each coupling step. Capping was performed by adding 7 ml of 0.5M acetic anhydride containing 0.015M HOBT in NMP along with 2 ml of the 2M DIPEA solution using a multi-step microwave protocol: 50 watts of power for 30 seconds (65° C. max temperature), followed by 30 seconds of microwave power off, followed by a second round of 30 seconds of microwave power on (50 watts), and then again 30 seconds of no microwave power. The resin was then drained and thoroughly washed with DMF. The following amino acids (Advanced Chemtech, Louisville, Ky., USA) were used: Cycle 20) Fmoc-Aib-OH; Cycle 21) Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 22) Fmoc-Glu(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 23) Fmoc-Ala-OH; Cycle 24) Fmoc-Pro-OH; Cycle 25) Fmoc-Ala-OH; Cycle 26) Fmoc-Aib-OH; Cycle 27) Fmoc-Glu(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 28) Fmoc-Gly-OH; Cycle 29) Fmoc-Pro-OH; Cycle 30) Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH; Cycle 31) Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 32) Fmoc-Pro-OH; Cycle 33) Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 34) Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-OH; Cycle 35) Fmoc-Pro-OH; and Cycle 36) Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the peptide backbone was complete, a standard piperidine treatment was used to remove the N-terminal Fmoc group using the standard deprotection procedure described previously. The resin was then thoroughly washed with DMF and then transferred back to the 50 ml conical tube using DMF as the transfer solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resin was deprotected and cleaved from the resin via treatment with 5 ml of the following reagent: 5% TIS, 2% water, 5% (w/v) DTT, and 88% TFA, and allowed to mix for 3.5 hours. The filtrate was collected into 45 ml of cold anhydrous ethyl ether. The precipitate was pelleted for 10 minutes at 3500 RPM in a refrigerated centrifuge. The ether was decanted and the peptide re-suspended in fresh ether. The ether workup was performed a total of 2 times. Following the last ether wash, the peptide was allowed to air dry to remove residual ether. The peptide pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of acetonitrile followed by 8 ml of de-ionized water and allowed to fully dissolve.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide solution was then analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mass analysis employing electrospray ionization identified a main product containing a mass of 4180.7, corresponding to the desired product. Analytical HPLC analysis, employing a 250×4.6 mm C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif., USA) using a gradient of 2-60% acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) over 30 minutes identified a main product with 68% purity. The crude peptide was then purified on a preparative HPLC equipped with a C18 reverse phase column using a 10-60% acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) over 50 minutes at a 10 ml/min flow rate. The purified product was analyzed by HPLC for purity (>99%) and mass spectrometry (4180.5 da), with the experimental mass corresponding to the expected mass of 4180.6. The peptide was subsequently lyophilized producing 53 mg of purified product representing a 13% yield.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther compounds of the invention can be prepared by a person of ordinary skill in the art using synthetic procedures analogous to those disclosed in the foregoing examples.

The homogenates were washed twice by centrifugation (39,000 g/10 min), and the final pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, containing 2.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo., USA), and 0.1% BSA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor assay, aliquots (0.4 ml) of the foregoing suspensions were incubated with 0.05 nM [\n125\nI]PYY (2200 Ci/mmol, Perkin-Elmer, Boston, Mass.), with and without 0.05 ml of unlabeled competing test peptides. After a 100 min incubation (25° C.), the bound [\n125\nI]PYY was separated from the free by rapid filtration through GF/C filters (Brandel, Gaithersburg, Md., USA), which had been previously soaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine. The filters were then washed three times with 5-ml aliquots of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, and the bound radioactivity trapped on the filters was counted by gamma spectrometry (Wallac LKB, Gaithersburg, Md., USA). Specific binding was defined as the total [\n125\nI]PYY bound minus that bound in the presence of 1000 nM PYY (Bachem, Torrence, Calif., USA). Inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated using the well-known Cheng-Prusoff equation, and said data, together with selectivity of said compounds with respect to the NPY-Y1 and the NPY-Y2, are given in Table 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the compounds of Examples 1-38 and 40-45 was subjected to the immediately foregoing radioligand assays, and nearly all of said compounds were found to have Ki of under 100 nM, as well as some of the exemplified compounds having Ki values in sub-nM range. It was also found that nearly all of said compounds highly selectively bind to the NPY-Y1 compared to the NPY-Y2.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNo.\n\n\nfor Y1\n\n\nfor Y2\n\n\nSelectivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n198\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n0.08\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n0.11\n\n\n944\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n658\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n0.68\n\n\n420\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n0.31\n\n\n319\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n0.60\n\n\n347\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n3.48\n\n\n52\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n2.58\n\n\n420\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n0.98\n\n\n578\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n2.95\n\n\n178\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n1.19\n\n\n505\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n3.47\n\n\n727\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n257.27\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n0.26\n\n\n710\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n0.29\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n595\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n171\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n19\n\n\n0.24\n\n\n997\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n0.20\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n0.13\n\n\n45\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n1.23\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n0.20\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n0.85\n\n\n841\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n26\n\n\n0.94\n\n\n198\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n0.74\n\n\n104\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n0.18\n\n\n441\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n1.16\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n0.59\n\n\n766\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n31\n\n\n1.91\n\n\n202\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n1.40\n\n\n483\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n239.06\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n34\n\n\n69.78\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n3.58\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n36\n\n\n34.23\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n37\n\n\n52.94\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n38\n\n\n502.28\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n39\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n40\n\n\n11.80\n\n\n895\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n41\n\n\n9.68\n\n\n>1000\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n42\n\n\n0.48\n\n\n466\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n43\n\n\n0.67\n\n\n22\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n44\n\n\n1.44\n\n\n151\n\n\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n45\n\n\n55.85\n\n\n38\n\n\nY2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdministration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptides of this invention can be provided in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of such salts include, but are not limited to, those formed with organic acids (e.g., acetic, lactic, maleic, citric, malic, ascorbic, succinic, benzoic, methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, or pamoic acid), inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid), and polymeric acids (e.g., tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose, polylactic, polyglycolic, or copolymers of polylactic-glycolic acids). A typical method of making a salt of a peptide of the present invention is well known in the art and can be accomplished by standard methods of salt exchange. Accordingly, the TFA salt of a peptide of the present invention (the TFA salt results from the purification of the peptide by using preparative HPLC eluting with TFA containing buffer solutions) can be converted into another salt, such as an acetate salt, by dissolving the peptide in a small amount of 0.25 N acetic acid aqueous solution. The resulting solution is applied to a semi-prep HPLC column (Zorbax, 300 SB, C-8). The column is eluted with (1) 0.1N ammonium acetate aqueous solution for 0.5 hours, (2) 0.25N acetic acid aqueous solution for 0.5 hours, and (3) a linear gradient (20% to 100% of solution B over 30 min) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min (solution A is 0.25N acetic acid aqueous solution; solution B is 0.25N acetic acid in acetonitrile/water, 80:20). The fractions containing the peptide are collected and lyophilized to dryness.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage of active ingredient in the compositions of this invention may be varied, however, it is necessary that the amount of the active ingredient be such that a suitable dosage form is obtained. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, the route of administration, and the duration of the treatment. In general, an effective dosage for the activities of this invention is in the range of 1×10\n−7 \nto 200 mg/kg/day, preferably 1×10\n−4 \nto 100 mg/kg/day, which can be administered as a single dose or divided into multiple doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention can be administered by oral, parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous injection, or implant), nasal, vaginal, rectal, sublingual, or topical routes of administration, and can be formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to provide dosage forms appropriate for each route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is admixed with at least one inert pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as sucrose, lactose, or starch. Such dosage forms can also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than such inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include, without limitation, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, elixirs, and the like, containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Besides such inert diluents, compositions can also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations according to this invention for parenteral administration include, without limitation, sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, and the like. Examples of non-aqueous solvents or vehicles include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtering through a bacteria-retaining filter, incorporating sterilizing agents, irradiating, or heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium, immediately before use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which may contain, in addition to the active substance, excipients such as coca butter or a suppository wax.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for nasal or sublingual administration are also prepared with standard excipients well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, a compound of this invention can be administered in a sustained release composition such as those described in the following patents and patent applications.
