(canceled) Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims priority to the following: U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/139,210 filed on Dec. 19, 2008, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/144,271 filed Jan. 13, 2009, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/187,556 filed on Jun. 16, 2009. The disclosure of each application is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptide-based drugs are highly effective medicines with relatively short duration of action and variable therapeutic index. The present disclosure is directed to peptide-based prodrugs wherein the prodrug derivative is designed to delay onset of action and extend the half life of the drug. The delayed onset of action is advantageous in that it allows systemic distribution of the prodrug prior to its activation. Accordingly, the administration of prodrugs eliminates complications caused by peak activities upon administration and increases the therapeutic index of the parent drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReceptor recognition and subsequent processing of peptide and protein agonists is the primary route of degradation of many peptide and protein-based drugs. Thus binding of the peptide drug to its receptor will result in biological stimulation, but will also initiate the subsequent deactivation of the peptide/protein induced pharmacology through the enzymatic degradation of the peptide or protein. In accordance with the present disclosure, prodrugs can be prepared to extend the peptide or protein's biological half life based on a strategy of inhibiting recognition of the prodrug by the corresponding receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prodrugs disclosed herein will ultimately be chemically converted to structures that can be recognized by the receptor, wherein the speed of this chemical conversion will determine the time of onset and duration of in vivo biological action. The molecular design disclosed in this application relies upon an intramolecular chemical reaction that is not dependent upon additional chemical additives, or enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPre-proglucagon is a 158 amino acid precursor polypeptide that is processed in different tissues to form a number of different proglucagon-derived peptides, including glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 701), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1; amino acids 7-36 are provided as SEQ ID NO: 703 and SEQ ID NO: 704), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2; SEQ ID NO: 708) and oxyntomodulin (OXM; SEQ ID NO: 706), that are involved in a wide variety of physiological functions, including glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, gastric emptying, and intestinal growth, as well as the regulation of food intake.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon is a 29-amino acid peptide (that corresponds to \namino acids\n 33 through 61 of pre-proglucagon, while GLP-1 is produced as a 37-amino acid peptide that corresponds to amino acids 72 through 108 of pre-proglucagon. GLP-1(7-36) amide (SEQ ID NO: 704; the C terminus is an arginine amide) or GLP-1(7-37) acid (SEQ ID NO: 703; C terminus is a glycine) are biologically potent forms of GLP-1, that demonstrate essentially equivalent activity at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon is a life-saving medicine that is used in the acute treatment of severe hypoglycemia. Oxyntomodulin has been reported to have pharmacological ability to suppress appetite and lower body weight. Clinical studies with GLP-1 receptor agonists or stabilized GLP-1 analogs have proven this family of peptides to be an effective treatment for Type II diabetes. In addition, it might be intrinsically safer than insulin therapy because of its glucose dependent action, thus eliminating the chances of hypoglycemia. Structure-activity relationship studies have shown that the N terminal histidine for each of these three peptides (glucagon, GLP-1 and oxyntomodulin) is especially important for the full action and that N-terminally extended forms severely diminish biological potency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional peptides are known that resemble glucagon and GLP-1 in structure and have similar activities. For example, Exendin-4 is a peptide present in the saliva of the Gila monster that resembles GLP-1 in structure, and like glucagon and GLP-1, increases insulin release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) is also known as a glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, and is a member of the secretin family of hormones. GIP is derived from a 153-amino acid proprotein encoded by the GIP gene and circulates as a biologically active 42-amino acid peptide (SEQ ID NO: 707). The GIP gene is expressed in the small intestine as well as the salivary glands and is a weak inhibitor of gastric acid secretion. In addition to its inhibitory effects in the stomach, in the presence of glucose, GIP enhances insulin release by pancreatic beta islet cells when administered in physiological doses. GIP is believed to function as an enteric factor that stimulates the release of pancreatic insulin and that may play a physiological role in maintaining glucose homeostasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOsteocalcin (SEQ ID NO: 709) is a noncollagenous protein found in bone and dentin. It is secreted by osteoblasts and thought to play a role in mineralization and calcium ion homeostasis. Osteocalcin has also been reported to function as a hormone in the body, causing beta cells in the pancreas to release more insulin, and at the same time directing fat cells to release the hormone adiponectin, which increases sensitivity to insulin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne disadvantage associated with the therapeutic use of bioactive peptides such as osteocalcin, GIP, glucagon, GLP-1 and oxyntomodulin is their extremely short half-life (approximately two minutes for glucagon and GLP-1) in plasma. Accordingly, to obtain reasonable glycemic control, native glucagon-related peptides would need to be administered continuously for a prolonged period of time. The short half life of glucagon and GLP-1 related peptides results from the rapid degradation by Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV (DPP-IV), which cleaves between the second and third amino acids. This cleavage not only inactivates the native peptides but in the case of glucagon and GLP-1 the shortened forms could be functional antagonists at their respective receptors. Accordingly, there is a need for longer-acting variants of GIP, glucagon, GLP-1, and oxyntomodulin, and related peptides, to realize the full therapeutic potential of these mechanisms of drug action\n\n\n \nSUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments a prodrug derivative of a bioactive polypeptide selected from the group consisting of glucagon, exendin-4, GLP-1, GLP-2, GIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 27 (PACAP-27), peptide histidine methionine (PHM), oxyntomodulin, secretin, osteocalcin, growth hormone releasing hormone, as well as analogs, derivatives and conjugates of the foregoing is provided. The prodrug derivative comprises a dipeptide prodrug element covalently linked to an active site of the bioactive polypeptide via an amide linkage. In some embodiments the dipeptide is covalently bound to the bioactive polypeptide at a position that interferes with the bioactive polypeptide's ability to interact with its corresponding receptor or cofactor. In some embodiments the dipeptide prodrug element is linked to the amino-terminus of the bioactive peptide. Subsequent removal of the dipeptide, under physiological conditions and in the absence of enzymatic activity, restores full activity to the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments a prodrug is provided having the general structure of A-B-Q. In this embodiment Q is a bioactive peptide, selected from the group of glucagon superfamily peptides, including glucagon-related peptides, osteocalcin, as well as analogs, derivatives and conjugates of the foregoing; and A-B represents a dipeptide prodrug linked to the bioactive peptide through an amide bond. More particularly, in some embodiments A is an amino acid or a hydroxy acid and B is an N-alkylated amino acid linked to Q through formation of an amide bond between a carboxyl of B (in A-B) and an amine of Q. Furthermore, in some embodiments, A, B, or the amino acid of Q to which A-B is linked, is a non-coded amino acid, and chemical cleavage of A-B from Q is at least about 90% complete within about 1 to about 720 hours in PBS under physiological conditions. In another embodiment, chemical cleavage of A-B from Q is at least about 50% complete within about 1 hour or about 1 week in PBS under physiological conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments A and B are selected to inhibit enzymatic cleavage of the A-B dipeptide from Q by enzymes found in mammalian serum. In some embodiments A and/or B are selected such that the cleavage half-life of A-B from Q in PBS under physiological conditions, is not more than two fold the cleavage half-life of A-B from Q in a solution comprising a DPP-IV protease (i.e., cleavage of A-B from Q does not occur at a rate more than 2× faster in the presence of DPP-IV protease and physiological conditions relative to identical conditions in the absence of the enzyme). In some embodiments A and/or B is an amino acid in the D stereoisomer configuration.

The alpha carbon optionally may have one or two further organic substituents. An amino acid can be designated by its three letter code, one letter code, or in some cases by the name of its side chain. For example, an unnatural amino acid comprising a cyclohexane group attached to the alpha carbon is termed “cyclohexane” or “cyclohexyl.” For the purposes of the present disclosure designation of an amino acid without specifying its stereochemistry is intended to encompass either the L or D form of the amino acid, or a racemic mixture. However, in the instance where an amino acid is designated by its three letter code and includes a superscript number (i.e., Lys\n−1\n), such a designation is intended to specify the native L form of the amino acid, whereas the D form will be specified by inclusion of a lower case d before the three letter code and superscript number (i.e., dLys\n−1\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “hydroxyl acid” refers to an amino acid that has been modified to replace the alpha carbon amino group with a hydroxyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “non-coded amino acid” encompasses any amino acid that is not an L-isomer of any of the following 20 amino acids: Ala, Cys, Asp, Glu, Phe, Gly, His, Ile, Lys, Leu, Met, Asn, Pro, Gln, Arg, Ser, Thr, Val, Trp, Tyr.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “dipeptide” is the result of the linkage of an α-amino acid or α-hydroxyl acid to another amino acid, through a peptide bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “chemical cleavage” absent any further designation encompasses a non-enzymatic reaction that results in the breakage of a covalent chemical bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “bioactive polypeptide” refers to polypeptides which are capable of exerting a biological effect in vitro and/or in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an “acylated” amino acid is an amino acid comprising an acyl group which is non-native to a naturally-occurring amino acid, regardless by the means by which it is produced. Exemplary methods of producing acylated amino acids and acylated peptides are known in the art and include acylating an amino acid before inclusion in the peptide or peptide synthesis followed by chemical acylation of the peptide. In some embodiments, the acyl group causes the peptide to have one or more of (i) a prolonged half-life in circulation, (ii) a delayed onset of action, (iii) an extended duration of action, (iv) an improved resistance to proteases, such as DPP-IV, and (v) increased potency at the glucagon superfamily peptide and/or osteocalcin peptide receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an “alkylated” amino acid is an amino acid comprising an alkyl group which is non-native to a naturally-occurring amino acid, regardless of the means by which it is produced. Exemplary methods of producing alkylated amino acids and alkylated peptides are known in the art and including alkylating an amino acid before inclusion in the peptide or peptide synthesis followed by chemical alkylation of the peptide. Without being held to any particular theory, it is believed that alkylation of peptides will achieve similar, if not the same, effects as acylation of the peptides, e.g., a prolonged half-life in circulation, a delayed onset of action, an extended duration of action, an improved resistance to proteases, such as DPP-IV, and increased potency at the glucagon superfamily peptide and/or osteocalcin peptide receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a general reference to a peptide is intended to encompass peptides that have modified amino and carboxy termini. For example, an amino acid sequence designating the standard amino acids is intended to encompass standard amino acids at the N- and C-terminus as well as a corresponding hydroxyl acid at the N-terminus and/or a corresponding C-terminal amino acid modified to comprise an amide group in place of the terminal carboxylic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers, such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, water, emulsions such as an oil/water or water/oil, and various types of wetting agents. The term also encompasses any of the agents approved by a regulatory agency of the US Federal government or listed in the US Pharmacopeia for use in animals, including humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to salts of compounds that retain the biological activity of the parent compound, and which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. Many of the compounds disclosed herein are capable of forming acid and/or base salts by virtue of the presence of amino and/or carboxyl groups or groups similar thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be prepared from inorganic and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases, include by way of example only, sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium and magnesium salts. Salts derived from organic bases include, but are not limited to, salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared from inorganic and organic acids. Salts derived from inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Salts derived from organic acids include acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluene-sulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “treating” includes prophylaxis of the specific disorder or condition, or alleviation of the symptoms associated with a specific disorder or condition and/or preventing or eliminating said symptoms. For example, as used herein the term “treating diabetes” will refer in general to maintaining glucose blood levels near normal levels and may include increasing or decreasing blood glucose levels depending on a given situation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an “effective” amount or a “therapeutically effective amount” of a prodrug refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the prodrug to provide the desired effect. For example one desired effect would be the prevention or treatment of hyperglycemia. The amount that is “effective” will vary from subject to subject, depending on the age and general condition of the individual, mode of administration, and the like. Thus, it is not always possible to specify an exact “effective amount.” However, an appropriate “effective” amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term, “parenteral” means not through the alimentary canal but by some other route such as subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraspinal, or intravenous.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “identity” as used herein relates to the similarity between two or more sequences. Identity is measured by dividing the number of identical residues by the total number of residues and multiplying the product by 100 to achieve a percentage. Thus, two copies of exactly the same sequence have 100% identity, whereas two sequences that have amino acid deletions, additions, or substitutions relative to one another have a lower degree of identity.

Generally, all references to a particular amino acid position by number (e.g. position 28) refer to the amino acid at that position in native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 701) or the corresponding amino acid position in any analogs thereof. For example, a reference to “position 28” would mean the \ncorresponding position\n 27 for a glucagon analog in which the first amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 701 has been deleted.

More particularly, the prodrugs disclosed herein are formulated to enhance the half life of the parent bioactive peptide or protein, while allowing for subsequent activation of the prodrug via a non-enzymatic degradation mechanism. The ideal prodrug should be soluble in water at physiological conditions (for example, a pH of 7.2 and 37° C.), and it should be stable in the powder form for long term storage. It should also be immunologically silent and exhibit a low activity relative to the parent drug. In some embodiments, the prodrug will exhibit no more than 10% of the activity of the parent drug. In some embodiments the prodrug exhibits less than about 10%, less than about 5%, about 1%, or less than about 1% activity relative to the parent drug. Furthermore, the prodrug, when injected in the body, should be quantitatively converted to the active drug within a defined period of time. As disclosed herein, applicants have provided a general technique for producing prodrugs of a known bioactive polypeptide selected from the group consisting of glucagon superfamily peptides, including glucagon-related peptides, and osteocalcin, and analogs, derivatives and conjugates of such polypeptides, that meet each of these objectives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, a chemoreversible prodrug is provided comprising the sequence of a glucagon superfamily peptide, including for example a glucagon related peptide, or osteocalcin, or an analog, derivative or conjugate thereof, modified to have a dipeptide prodrug element covalently bound to the peptide via an amide linkage. Covalent attachment of the dipeptide prodrug element to an active site of the glucagon superfamily peptide inhibits the activity of the polypeptide until cleavage of the dipeptide prodrug element. In some embodiments a prodrug is provided having a “non-enzymatic activation half life” (t\n1/2\n) between about 1 to about 720 hrs under physiological conditions. Physiological conditions as disclosed herein are intended to include a temperature of about 35 to 40° C. and a pH of about 7.0 to about 7.4 and more typically include a pH of 7.2 to 7.4 and a temperature of 36 to 38° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdvantageously, the rate of cleavage, and thus activation of the prodrug, depends on the structure and stereochemistry of the dipeptide prodrug element. The prodrugs disclosed herein ultimately are chemically converted to structures that are recognized by the native receptor of the drug, wherein the speed of this chemical conversion determines the time of onset and duration of in vivo biological action. The molecular design disclosed in this application relies upon an intramolecular chemical reaction that is not dependent upon additional chemical additives, or enzymes. The speed of conversion is controlled by the chemical nature of the dipeptide substituent and its cleavage under physiological conditions. Since physiological pH and temperature are tightly regulated within a highly defined range, the speed of conversion from prodrug to drug will exhibit high intra- and interpatient reproducibility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs disclosed herein prodrugs are provided which have extended half lives by virtue of being in a prodrug form for at least about 1 hour, and, in some embodiments, greater than about 20 hours. In some embodiments the half life of the prodrugs is about 1, 6, 8, 12, 20, 24, 48 or 72 hours. In some embodiments the half life of the prodrugs is about 100 hours or greater including half lives of up to about 168, 336, 504, 672 or 720 hours, and are converted to the active form at physiological conditions through a non-enzymatic reaction driven by inherent chemical instability. In some embodiments the non-enzymatic activation t\n1/2 \ntime of the prodrug is between 1-100 hrs, and more typically between 12 and 72 hours, for example, between 12 and 48 hours and between 48 and 72 hours, and in some embodiments the t\n1/2 \nis between 24-48 hrs as measured by incubating the prodrug in a phosphate buffer solution (e.g., PBS) at 37° C. and pH of 7.2. In another embodiment the non-enzymatic activation t\n1/2 \ntime of the prodrug is between 1 and 6 hours, for example, about 1 hour, about 2 hours, about 3 hours, about 4 hours, about 5 hours, or about 6 hours. In another embodiment the non-enzymatic activation t\n1/2 \ntime of the prodrug is between 6 and 24 hours. The half lives of the various prodrugs are calculated by using the formula t\n1/2\n=0.693/k, where ‘k’ is the first order rate constant for the degradation of the prodrug. In some embodiments, activation of the prodrug occurs after cleavage of an amide bond linked dipeptide, and formation of a diketopiperazine or diketomorpholine, and release of the active polypeptide drug. Specific dipeptides composed of natural, non-coding and/or synthetic amino acids have been identified that facilitate intramolecular decomposition under physiological conditions to release the active polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments a prodrug of a glucagon superfamily peptide, or osteocalcin, or an analog, derivative or conjugate thereof, is provided comprising the structure A-B-Q. In this embodiment, Q is the peptide, A is an amino acid or a hydroxy acid and B is an N-alkylated amino acid. In some embodiments the glucagon superfamily peptide is a glucagon related peptide. A and B together represent the dipeptide prodrug element that is linked to Q through formation of an amide bond between A-B and an amine of Q. In some embodiments at least one of A, B, or the amino acid of Q to which A-B is linked, is a non-coded amino acid. Furthermore, in some embodiments the dipeptide prodrug element is selected wherein chemical cleavage of A-B from Q is at least about 90% complete within about 1 to about 720 hours in PBS under physiological conditions. In a further embodiment the amino acids of the dipeptide are selected wherein the cleavage half-life of A-B from Q in PBS under physiological conditions, is not more than two to five fold the cleavage half-life of A-B from Q in a solution comprising a DPP-IV protease (including for example, human serum).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments an aliphatic amino group of Q (e.g., a primary amine), including for example the N-terminal amine or the amino group of an amino acid side chain, is modified by the covalent linkage of the dipeptide prodrug element via an amide bond. In some embodiments the dipeptide prodrug element is linked to a side chain amino group of an amino acid present in Q, either directly or through a linking moiety. In some embodiments the linking moiety comprises an amine bearing acyl group or alkyl group. In some embodiments a glucagon superfamily peptide, e.g., glucagon related peptide, is provided comprising an acyl group or alkyl group covalently linked to the amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 10 or 20 of the glucagon superfamily peptide, wherein the acyl group or alkyl group further comprises a dipeptide prodrug element linked to the acyl group or alkyl group via an amide bond. For example, the embodiment contemplates that the prodrug is linked to an amino group of Q either directly or through a linking group, and an acyl or alkyl group is linked to the prodrug either directly or through a linking moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the dipeptide prodrug element is linked directly to the amino acid side chain, wherein the amino acid has the general structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein n is an integer of 1-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the dipeptide prodrug element can be linked to an amino substituent present on an aryl ring of an aromatic amino acid, including for example an aromatic amino acid selected from the group consisting of amino-Phe, amino-napthyl alanine, amino tryptophan, amino-phenyl-glycine, amino-homo-Phe, and amino tyrosine. In some embodiments the dipeptide prodrug element is linked to the aromatic amino group of an amino acid having the general structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein m is an integer from 0 to 3. In some embodiments the dipeptide prodrug element is linked to the 4-amino group of an amino acid having the general structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein m is an integer from 0 to 3. In some embodiments the dipeptide prodrug element is linked to the side chain amino group of a lysine amino acid or the aromatic amino group of a 4-aminophenylalanine (substituted for a native phenylalanine or tyrosine residue of the bioactive peptide). In some embodiments the dipeptide prodrug element is linked to a primary amine present on an internal amino acid of a glucagon superfamily peptide, including a glucagon-related peptide, or osteocalcin, or an analog, derivatives or conjugate thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the dipeptide prodrug element has the general structure A-B, wherein A is an amino acid or a hydroxyl acid and B is an N-alkylated amino acid that will be bound through an amide bond to a primary amino group of such a peptide to produce the corresponding prodrug of the peptide. In some embodiments the glucagon superfamily peptide is a glucagon related peptide. In some embodiments A and B are selected so that when the A-B dipeptide is bound to a primary amine of such a peptide through an amide bond, chemical cleavage of A-B from the peptide is at least about 90% complete within about 1 to about 720 hours in PBS under physiological conditions. In some embodiments A and/or B are amino acids in the D stereoisomer configuration. In some exemplary embodiments, A is an amino acid in the D stereoisomer configuration and B is an amino acid in the L stereoisomer configuration. In some exemplary embodiments, A is an amino acid in the L stereoisomer configuration and B is an amino acid in the D stereoisomer configuration. In some exemplary embodiments, A is an amino acid in the D stereoisomer configuration and B is an amino acid in the D stereoisomer configuration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments the dipeptide prodrug element can be further modified to comprise a hydrophilic moiety. In some embodiments the hydrophilic moiety is a polyethylene glycol chain. In accordance with some embodiments a polyethylene glycol chain of 40 k or higher is covalently bound to the side chain of the A or B amino acid of the dipeptide prodrug element. In another embodiment the dipeptide prodrug element is additionally or alternatively acylated or alkylated with a fatty acid or bile acid, or salt thereof, e.g. a C4 to C30 fatty acid, a C8 to C24 fatty acid, cholic acid, a C4 to C30 alkyl, a C8 to C24 alkyl, or an alkyl comprising a steroid moiety of a bile acid. Alternatively, the dipeptide prodrug element can be linked to a depot protein such as dextran or a large PEG molecule (greater or equal to 80,000 daltons) that serves to sequester the prodrug at an injection site until cleavage of the dipeptide releases the active bioactive peptide. Further modifications for dipeptide prodrugs are described below in the section concerning glucagon related peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dipeptide prodrug element is designed to cleave based upon an intramolecular chemical reaction that is not dependent upon additional chemical additives, or enzymes. More particularly, in some embodiments the dipeptide structure is selected to resist cleavage by peptidases present in mammalian sera, including for example dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). Accordingly, in some embodiments the rate of cleavage of the dipeptide prodrug element from the bioactive peptide is not substantially enhanced (e.g., greater than 2×) when the reaction is conducted using physiological conditions in the presence of serum proteases relative to conducting the reaction in the absence of the proteases. Thus the cleavage half-life of A-B from the bioactive peptide in PBS under physiological conditions, is not more than two, three, four or five fold the cleavage half-life of A-B from the bioactive protein in a solution comprising a DPP-IV protease. In some embodiments the solution comprising a DPP-IV protease is serum, more particularly mammalian serum, including human serum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments A or B of the dipeptide prodrug element, or the amino acid of the glucagon superfamily peptide to which A-B is linked is a non-coded amino acid. In some embodiments amino acid “B” is N-alkylated but is not proline. In some embodiments the N-alkylated group of amino acid B is a C\n1\n-C\n18 \nalkyl, and in some embodiments is C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments a prodrug derivative of a glucagon superfamily peptide, comprising a dipeptide prodrug element disclosed herein, can be co-administered with a protease inhibitor, including a specific DPP-IV inhibitor (e.g., Januvia®, Merck & Co, Inc), as a means of delaying activation of the prodrug. In this embodiment the amino acids of the prodrug element are selected so the dipeptide is an acceptable substrate for DPP-IV cleavage. In some embodiments the glucagon superfamily peptide is a glucagon related peptide. The protease inhibitor can be administered in a separate composition or the prodrug and protease inhibitor can be formulated as a single composition. When administered as separate compositions, the protease inhibitor is typically administered within 1-5 hours, 1-2 hours, 30 minutes, or 10 minutes of administration of the prodrug.

For example, the glucagon related peptide may be one of \nClass\n 1, \nClass\n 2, or \nClass\n 3, and may comprise an acyl group which is non-native to a naturally-occurring amino acid. Acylation can be carried out at any position within the glucagon related peptide, including any of positions 1-29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the C-terminal amino acid, provided that the activity exhibited by the non-acylated glucagon related peptide is retained upon acylation. For example, if the unacylated peptide has glucagon agonist activity, then the acylated peptide retains the glucagon agonist activity. Also for example, if the unacylated peptide has glucagon antagonist activity, then the acylated peptide retains the glucagon antagonist activity. For instance, if the unacylated peptide has GLP-1 agonist activity, then the acylated peptide retains GLP-1 agonist activity. Nonlimiting examples include acylation at \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28, or 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon).

The acyl group can be covalently linked directly to an amino acid of the glucagon related peptide, or indirectly to an amino acid of the glucagon related peptide via a spacer, wherein the spacer is positioned between the amino acid of the glucagon related peptide and the acyl group. Glucagon related peptides may be acylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position. Nonlimiting examples include acylation at position 10 (according to the amino acid numbering of the wild type glucagon) and pegylation at one or more positions in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide, e.g., position 24, 28 or 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of the wild type glucagon), within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminus (e.g., through adding a C-terminal Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the glucagon related peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group by direct acylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon related peptide.

In some embodiments, the glucagon related peptide is covalently bound to the spacer, which is covalently bound to the acyl group. In some exemplary embodiments, the glucagon related peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group by acylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a spacer, which spacer is attached to a side chain of an amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 10, 20, 24, or 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of the wild type glucagon), or at the C-terminal amino acid of the glucagon related peptide. The amino acid to which the spacer is attached can be any amino acid comprising a moiety which permits linkage to the spacer. For example, an amino acid comprising a side chain —NH\n2\n, —OH, or —COOH (e.g., Lys, Orn, Ser, Asp, or Glu) is suitable. Also, with regard to \nClass\n 1, \nClass\n 2, and \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides, an amino acid (e.g., a singly or doubly α-substituted amino acid) comprising a side chain —NH\n2\n, —OH, or —COOH (e.g., Lys, Orn, Ser, Asp, or Glu) is suitable. In this respect, the acylated glucagon related peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 701, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at \n \npositions\n \n 10, 20, 24, and 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of the wild type glucagon) modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or carboxylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol, or a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol. In some embodiments, the amino acid spacer is not γ-Glu. In some embodiments, the dipeptide spacer is not γ-Glu-γ-Glu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen acylation occurs through an amine group of the amino acid of the spacer, the acylation can occur through the alpha amine of the amino acid or a side chain amine. In the instance in which the alpha amine is acylated, the spacer amino acid can be any amino acid. For example, the spacer amino acid can be a hydrophobic amino acid, e.g., Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Trp, Met, Phe, Tyr. In some embodiments in which the glucagon related peptide is a \nClass\n 1, \nClass\n 2, or \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide, the spacer amino acid can be, for example, a hydrophobic amino acid, e.g., Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Be, Trp, Met, Phe, Tyr, 6-amino hexanoic acid, 5-aminovaleric acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid. Alternatively, the spacer amino acid can be an acidic residue, e.g., Asp and Glu. In the instance in which the side chain amine of the spacer amino acid is acylated, the spacer amino acid is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, e.g., an amino acid of Formula I (e.g., Lys or Orn). In this instance, it is possible for both the alpha amine and the side chain amine of the spacer amino acid to be acylated, such that the glucagon peptide is diacylated. Embodiments of the invention include such diacylated molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen acylation occurs through a hydroxyl group of the amino acid of the spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula II.

The two amino acid side chains can be linked to one another through hydrogen-bonding, ionic interactions, such as the formation of salt bridges, or by covalent bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are 3 amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions i and i+4, wherein i is any integer between 12 and 25 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25) according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon. More particularly, the side chains of the amino acid pairs 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24 or 24 and 28 (amino acid pairs in which i=12, 16, 20, or 24) according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon are linked to one another and thus stabilize the glucagon alpha helix. Alternatively, i can be 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, wherein the amino acids at positions i and i+4 are joined by an intramolecular bridge, the size of the linker is about 8 atoms, or about 7-9 atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are two amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions j and j+3, wherein j is any integer between 12 and 26 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26) according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon. In some specific embodiments, j is 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, wherein amino acids at positions j and j+3 are joined by an intramolecular bridge, the size of the linker is about 6 atoms, or about 5 to 7 atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are 6 amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions k and k+7, wherein k is any integer between 12 and 22 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22) according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon. In some specific embodiments, k is 12, 13, or 17. In an exemplary embodiment, k is 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of amino acid pairings that are capable of covalently bonding to form a six-atom linking bridge include Orn and Asp, Glu and an amino acid of Formula I, wherein n is 2, and homoglutamic acid and an amino acid of Formula I, wherein n is 1, wherein Formula I is:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of amino acid pairing that are capable of covalently bonding to form a seven-atom linking bridge include Orn-Glu (lactam ring); Lys-Asp (lactam); or Homoser-Homoglu (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form an eight-atom linker include Lys-Glu (lactam); Homolys-Asp (lactam); Orn-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe-Asp (lactam); or Tyr-Asp (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form a nine-atom linker include Homolys-Glu (lactam); Lys-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe-Glu (lactam); or Tyr-Glu (lactone). Any of the side chains on these amino acids may additionally be substituted with additional chemical groups, so long as the three-dimensional structure of the alpha-helix is not disrupted. One of ordinary skill in the art can envision alternative pairings or alternative amino acid analogs, including chemically modified derivatives, that would create a stabilizing structure of similar size and desired effect. For example, a homocysteine-homocysteine disulfide bridge is 6 atoms in length and may be further modified to provide the desired effect. Even without covalent linkage, the amino acid pairings described above or similar pairings that one of ordinary skill in the art can envision may also provide added stability to the alpha-helix through non-covalent bonds, for example, through formation of salt bridges or hydrogen-bonding interactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe size of a lactam ring can vary depending on the length of the amino acid side chains, and in some embodiments the lactam is formed by linking the side chains of a lysine amino acid to a glutamic acid side chain. Further exemplary embodiments (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) include the following pairings, optionally with a lactam bridge: Glu at position 12 with Lys at position 16; native Lys at position 12 with Glu at position 16; Glu at position 16 with Lys at \nposition\n 20; Lys at position 16 with Glu at \nposition\n 20; Glu at \nposition\n 20 with Lys at position 24; Lys at \nposition\n 20 with Glu at position 24; Glu at position 24 with Lys at position 28; Lys at position 24 with Glu at position 28. Alternatively, the order of the amide bond in the lactam ring can be reversed (e.g., a lactam ring can be formed between the side chains of a Lys12 and a Glu16 or alternatively between a Glu 12 and a Lys16).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntramolecular bridges other than a lactam bridge can be used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon related peptides. In some embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is a hydrophobic bridge. In this instance, the intramolecular bridge optionally is between the side chains of two amino acids that are part of the hydrophobic face of the alpha helix of the glucagon related peptide. For example, one of the amino acids joined by the hydrophobic bridge can be the amino acid at \nposition\n 10, 14, and 18 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific aspect, olefin metathesis is used to cross-link one or two turns of the alpha helix of the glucagon related peptide using an all-hydrocarbon cross-linking system. The glucagon related peptide in this instance can comprise α-methylated amino acids bearing olefinic side chains of varying length and configured with either R or S stereochemistry at the and i+4 or i+7 positions. For example, the olefinic side can comprise (CH\n2\n)\nn\n, wherein n is any integer between 1 to 6. In some embodiments, n is 3 for a cross-link length of 8 atoms. Suitable methods of forming such intramolecular bridges are described in the art. See, for example, Schafmeister et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n122: 5891-5892 (2000) and Walensky et al., \nScience \n305: 1466-1470 (2004). Alternatively, the glucagon peptide can comprise O-allyl Ser residues located on adjacent helical turns, which are bridged together via ruthenium-catalyzed ring closing metathesis. Such procedures of cross-linking are described in, for example, Blackwell et al., \nAngew, Chem., Int. Ed. \n37: 3281-3284 (1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another specific aspect, use of the unnatural thio-dialanine amino acid, lanthionine, which has been widely adopted as a peptidomimetic of cystine, is used to cross-link one turn of the alpha helix. Suitable methods of lanthionine-based cyclization are known in the art. See, for instance, Matteucci et al., Tetrahedron Letters 45: 1399-1401 (2004); Mayer et al., \nJ. Peptide Res. \n51: 432-436 (1998); Polinsky et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n35: 4185-4194 (1992); Osapay et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n40: 2241-2251 (1997); Fukase et al., \nBull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. \n65: 2227-2240 (1992); Harpp et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n36: 73-80 (1971); Goodman and Shao, \nPure Appl. Chem. \n68: 1303-1308 (1996); and Osapay and Goodman, \nJ. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. \n1599-1600 (1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, α, ω-diaminoalkane tethers, e.g., 1,4-diaminopropane and 1,5-diaminopentane) between two Glu residues at positions i and i+7 are used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Such tethers lead to the formation of a bridge 9-atoms or more in length, depending on the length of the diaminoalkane tether. Suitable methods of producing peptides cross-linked with such tethers are described in the art. See, for example, Phelan et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n119: 455-460 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment of the invention, a disulfide bridge is used to cross-link one or two turns of the alpha helix of the glucagon related peptide. Alternatively, a modified disulfide bridge in which one or both sulfur atoms are replaced by a methylene group resulting in an isosteric macrocyclization is used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon related peptide. Suitable methods of modifying peptides with disulfide bridges or sulfur-based cyclization are described in, for example, Jackson et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n113: 9391-9392 (1991) and Rudinger and Jost, \nExperientia \n20: 570-571 (1964).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the alpha helix of the glucagon related peptide is stabilized via the binding of metal atom by two His residues or a His and Cys pair positioned at i and i+4. The metal atom can be, for example, Ru(III), Cu(II), Zn(II), or Cd(II). Such methods of metal binding-based alpha helix stabilization are known in the art. See, for example, Andrews and Tabor, \nTetrahedron \n55: 11711-11743 (1999); Ghadiri et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n112: 1630-1632 (1990); and Ghadiri et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n119: 9063-9064 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alpha helix of the glucagon related peptide can alternatively be stabilized through other means of peptide cyclizing, which means are reviewed in Davies, \nJ. Peptide. Sci. \n9: 471-501 (2003). The alpha helix can be stabilized via the formation of an amide bridge, thioether bridge, thioester bridge, urea bridge, carbamate bridge, sulfonamide bridge, and the like. For example, a thioester bridge can be formed between the C-terminus and the side chain of a Cys residue. Alternatively, a thioester can be formed via side chains of amino acids having a thiol (Cys) and a carboxylic acid (e.g., Asp, Glu). In another method, a cross-linking agent, such as a dicarboxylic acid, e.g. suberic acid (octanedioic acid), etc. can introduce a link between two functional groups of an amino acid side chain, such as a free amino, hydroxyl, thiol group, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the alpha helix of the glucagon related peptide is stabilized through the incorporation of hydrophobic amino acids at positions i and i+4. For instance, i can be Tyr and i+4 can be either Val or Leu; i can be Phe and i+4 can be Cys or Met; I can be Cys and i+4 can be Met; or i can be Phe and i+4 can be Ile. It should be understood that, for purposes herein, the above amino acid pairings can be reversed, such that the indicated amino acid at position i could alternatively be located at i+4, while the i+4 amino acid can be located at the i position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with other embodiments of the invention, wherein glucagon related peptide is a peptide having glucagon agonist activity, GIP agonist activity, glucagon antagonist and GLP-1 activity, the alpha helix is stabilized through incorporation (either by amino acid substitution or insertion) of one or more alpha helix-stabilizing amino acids at the C-terminal portion of the glucagon related peptide (around amino acids 12-29 according to the numbering of the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon). In a specific embodiment, the alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid is an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, including, but not limited to any of amino iso-butyric acid (AIB), an amino acid disubstituted with the same or a different group selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, and n-butyl, or with a cyclooctane or cycloheptane (e.g., 1-aminocyclooctane-1-carboxylic acid). In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of \n \npositions\n \n 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 or 29 of the glucagon related peptide is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid. In a specific embodiment, one, two, three or all of \npositions\n 16, 20, 21, and 24 are substituted with AIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also encompasses conjugates in which a glucagon related peptide (e.g. a \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide, \nClass\n 2 glucagon related peptide, \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide, \nClass\n 4 glucagon related peptide, or \nClass\n 5 glucagon related peptide), is linked, optionally via covalent bonding and optionally via a linker, to a conjugate moiety. Linkage can be accomplished by covalent chemical bonds, physical forces such electrostatic, hydrogen, ionic, van der Waals, or hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions. A variety of non-covalent coupling systems may be used, including biotin-avidin, ligand/receptor, enzyme/substrate, nucleic acid/nucleic acid binding protein, lipid/lipid binding protein, cellular adhesion molecule partners; or any binding partners or fragments thereof which have affinity for each other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glucagon related peptide can be linked to conjugate moieties via direct covalent linkage by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the peptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues of these targeted amino acids. Reactive groups on the peptide or conjugate moiety include, e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group. Derivatizing agents include, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride or other agents known in the art. Alternatively, the conjugate moieties can be linked to the peptide indirectly through intermediate carriers, such as polysaccharide or polypeptide carriers. Examples of polysaccharide carriers include aminodextran. Examples of suitable polypeptide carriers include polylysine, polyglutamic acid, polyaspartic acid, co-polymers thereof, and mixed polymers of these amino acids and others, e.g., serines, to confer desirable solubility properties on the resultant loaded carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCysteinyl residues most commonly are reacted with α-haloacetates (and corresponding amines), such as chloroacetic acid or chloroacetamide, to give carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Cysteinyl residues also are derivatized by reaction with bromotrifluoroacetone, alpha-bromo-β-(5-imidozoyl)propionic acid, chloroacetyl phosphate, N-alkylmaleimides, 3-nitro-2-pyridyl disulfide, methyl 2-pyridyl disulfide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, or chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHistidyl residues are derivatized by reaction with diethylpyrocarbonate at pH 5.5-7.0 because this agent is relatively specific for the histidyl side chain. Para-bromophenacyl bromide also is useful; the reaction is preferably performed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLysinyl and amino-terminal residues are reacted with succinic or other carboxylic acid anhydrides. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge of the lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing alpha-amino-containing residues include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate, pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxal, chloroborohydride, trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, O-methylisourea, 2,4-pentanedione, and transaminase-catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nArginyl residues are modified by reaction with one or several conventional reagents, among them phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and ninhydrin. Derivatization of arginine residues requires that the reaction be performed in alkaline conditions because of the high pK\na \nof the guanidine functional group. Furthermore, these reagents may react with the groups of lysine as well as the arginine epsilon-amino group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specific modification of tyrosyl residues may be made, with particular interest in introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. Most commonly, N-acetylimidizole and tetranitromethane are used to form O-acetyl tyrosyl species and 3-nitro derivatives, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) are selectively modified by reaction with carbodiimides (R—N═C═N—R′), where R and R′ are different alkyl groups, such as 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-4-ethyl) carbodiimide or 1-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4-dimethylpentyl) carbodiimide. Furthermore, aspartyl and glutamyl residues are converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the alpha-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties, W.H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86 (1983)), deamidation of asparagine or glutamine, acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and/or amidation or esterification of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of covalent modification involves chemically or enzymatically coupling glycosides to the peptide. Sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine, (b) free carboxyl groups, (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine, (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline, (e) aromatic residues such as those of tyrosine, or tryptophan, or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO87/05330 published 11 Sep. 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston, CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306 (1981).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary conjugate moieties that can be linked to any of the glucagon related peptides described herein include but are not limited to a heterologous peptide or polypeptide (including for example, a plasma protein), a targeting agent, an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region), a diagnostic label such as a radioisotope, fluorophore or enzymatic label, a polymer including water soluble polymers, or other therapeutic or diagnostic agents. In some embodiments a conjugate is provided comprising a glucagon related peptide of the present invention and a plasma protein, wherein the plasma protein is selected from the group consisting of albumin, transferin, fibrinogen and globulins. In some embodiments the plasma protein moiety of the conjugate is albumin or transferin. In some embodiments, the linker comprises a chain of atoms from 1 to about 60, or 1 to 30 atoms or longer, 2 to 5 atoms, 2 to 10 atoms, 5 to 10 atoms, or 10 to 20 atoms long. In some embodiments, the chain atoms are all carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the chain atoms in the backbone of the linker are selected from the group consisting of C, O, N, and S. Chain atoms and linkers may be selected according to their expected solubility (hydrophilicity) so as to provide a more soluble conjugate. In some embodiments, the linker provides a functional group that is subject to cleavage by an enzyme or other catalyst or hydrolytic conditions found in the target tissue or organ or cell. In some embodiments, the length of the linker is long enough to reduce the potential for steric hindrance. If the linker is a covalent bond or a peptidyl bond and the conjugate is a polypeptide, the entire conjugate can be a fusion protein. Such peptidyl linkers may be any length. Exemplary linkers are from about 1 to 50 amino acids in length, 5 to 50, 3 to 5, 5 to 10, 5 to 15, or 10 to 30 amino acids in length. Such fusion proteins may alternatively be produced by recombinant genetic engineering methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, in some embodiments, the glucagon related peptides are conjugated, e.g., fused to an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region). Known types of immunoglobulins (Ig) include IgG, IgA, IgE, IgD or IgM. The Fc region is a C-terminal region of an Ig heavy chain, which is responsible for binding to Fc receptors that carry out activities such as recycling (which results in prolonged half-life), antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, according to some definitions the human IgG heavy chain Fc region stretches from Cys226 to the C-terminus of the heavy chain. The “hinge region” generally extends from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgG1 (hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgG1 sequence by aligning the cysteines involved in cysteine bonding). The Fc region of an IgG includes two constant domains, CH2 and CH3. The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 231 to amino acid 341. The CH3 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 342 to 447. References made to amino acid numbering of immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments, or regions, are all based on Kabat et al. 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of Public Health, Bethesda, Md. In a related embodiment, the Fc region may comprise one or more native or modified constant regions from an immunoglobulin heavy chain, other than CH1, for example, the CH2 and CH3 regions of IgG and IgA, or the CH3 and CH4 regions of IgE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable conjugate moieties include portions of immunoglobulin sequence that include the FcRn binding site. FcRn, a salvage receptor, is responsible for recycling immunoglobulins and returning them to circulation in blood. The region of the Fc portion of IgG that binds to the FcRn receptor has been described based on X-ray crystallography (Burmeister et al. 1994, Nature 372:379). The major contact area of the Fc with the FcRn is near the junction of the CH2 and CH3 domains. Fc-FcRn contacts are all within a single Ig heavy chain. The major contact sites include amino acid residues 248, 250-257, 272, 285, 288, 290-291, 308-311, and 314 of the CH2 domain and amino acid residues 385-387, 428, and 433-436 of the CH3 domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome conjugate moieties may or may not include FcγR binding site(s). FcγR are responsible for ADCC and CDC. Examples of positions within the Fc region that make a direct contact with FcγR are amino acids 234-239 (lower hinge region), amino acids 265-269 (B/C loop), amino acids 297-299 (C′/E loop), and amino acids 327-332 (F/G) loop (Sondermann et al., Nature 406: 267-273, 2000). The lower hinge region of IgE has also been implicated in the FcRI binding (Henry, et al., Biochemistry 36, 15568-15578, 1997). Residues involved in IgA receptor binding are described in Lewis et al., (J. Immunol. 175:6694-701, 2005). Amino acid residues involved in IgE receptor binding are described in Sayers et al. (J Biol. Chem. 279(34):35320-5, 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid modifications may be made to the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. Such variant Fc regions comprise at least one amino acid modification in the CH3 domain of the Fc region (residues 342-447) and/or at least one amino acid modification in the CH2 domain of the Fc region (residues 231-341). Mutations believed to impart an increased affinity for FcRn include T256A, T307A, E380A, and N434A (Shields et al. 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Other mutations may reduce binding of the Fc region to FcγRI, FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, and/or FcγRIIIA without significantly reducing affinity for FcRn. For example, substitution of the Asn at position 297 of the Fc region with Ala or another amino acid removes a highly conserved N-glycosylation site and may result in reduced immunogenicity with concomitant prolonged half-life of the Fc region, as well as reduced binding to FcγRs (Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847; Friend et al. 1999, Transplantation 68:1632; Shields et al. 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Amino acid modifications at positions 233-236 of IgG1 have been made that reduce binding to FcγRs (Ward and Ghetie 1995, Therapeutic Immunology 2:77 and Armour et al. 1999, Eur. J. Immunol. 29:2613). Some exemplary amino acid substitutions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,355,008 and 7,381,408, each incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nrPEG\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the conjugate of the invention comprises a glucagon superfamily peptide, including glucagon-related peptides, osteocalcin, as well as analogs, derivatives and conjugates of the foregoing, fused to an accessory peptide which is capable of forming an extended conformation similar to chemical PEG (e.g., a recombinant PEG (rPEG) molecule), such as those described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO2009/023270 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2008/0286808. The rPEG molecule is not polyethylene glycol. The rPEG molecule in some aspects is a polypeptide comprising one or more of glycine, serine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, or proline. In some aspects, the rPEG is a homopolymer, e.g., poly-glycine, poly-serine, poly-glutamic acid, poly-aspartic acid, poly-alanine, or poly-proline. In other embodiments, the rPEG comprises two types of amino acids repeated, e.g., poly(Gly-Ser), poly(Gly-Glu), poly(Gly-Ala), poly(Gly-Asp), poly(Gly-Pro), poly(Ser-Glu), etc. In some aspects, the rPEG comprises three different types of amino acids, e.g., poly(Gly-Ser-Glu). In specific aspects, the rPEG increases the half-life of the glucagon superfamily peptide, or osteocalcin. In some aspects, the rPEG comprises a net positive or net negative charge. The rPEG in some aspects lacks secondary structure. In some embodiments, the rPEG is greater than or equal to 10 amino acids in length and in some embodiments is about 40 to about 50 amino acids in length. The accessory peptide in some aspects is fused to the N- or C-terminus of the peptide of the invention through a peptide bond or a proteinase cleavage site, or is inserted into the loops of the peptide of the invention. The rPEG in some aspects comprises an affinity tag or is linked to a PEG that is greater than 5 kDa. In some embodiments, the rPEG confers the peptide of the invention with an increased hydrodynamic radius, serum half-life, protease resistance, or solubility and in some aspects confers the peptide with decreased immunogenicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusion Peptides—C-Terminal Extension\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments a glucagon related peptide may comprise a C-terminus or a C-terminal amino acid sequence including but not limited to: COOH, CONH\n2\n, GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 710), GPSSGAPPPS-CONH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 711), a oxyntomodulin carboxy terminal extension, KRNRNNIA (SEQ ID NO: 714) or KGKKNDWKHNITQ (SEQ ID NO: 713). For example, the terminal ten amino acids of Exendin-4 (i.e. the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 710 (GPSSGAPPPS)) are linked to the carboxy terminus of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide, \nClass\n 2 glucagon related peptide, \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide, \nClass\n 4 glucagon related peptide, or \nClass\n 5 glucagon related peptide of the present disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother compound that induces weight loss is oxyntomodulin, a naturally occurring digestive hormone found in the small intestine (see Diabetes 2005; 54:2390-2395). Oxyntomodulin is a 37 amino acid peptide (SEQ ID NO: 706) that contains the 29 amino acid sequence of glucagon followed by an 8 amino acid carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 714 (KRNRNNIA). Accordingly, in some embodiments prodrug derivatives of glucagon related peptides are provided that further comprise the carboxy terminal extension of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 714 or a four amino acid extension having the sequence KRNR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon Modification at \nPosition\n 3\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon related peptides of \nClasses\n 1 to 3 described herein may be modified at position 3 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) to maintain or increase activity at the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments in which the glucagon related peptide is a \nClass\n 1, \nClass\n 2, or \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide, maintained or enhanced activity at the glucagon receptor may be achieved by modifying the Gln at \nposition\n 3 with a glutamine analog. For example, a \nClass\n 1, \nClass\n 2, or \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprising a glutamine analog at \nposition\n 3 may exhibit about 5%, about 10%, about 20%, about 50%, or about 85% or greater the activity of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 701) at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments a \nClass\n 1, \nClass\n 2, or \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprising a glutamine analog at \nposition\n 3 may exhibit about 20%, about 50%, about 75%, about 100%, about 200% or about 500% or greater the activity of a corresponding glucagon peptide having the same amino acid sequence as the peptide comprising the glutamine analog, except for the modified amino acid at \nposition\n 3 at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, a \nClass\n 1, \nClass\n 2, or \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprising a glutamine analog at \nposition\n 3 exhibits enhanced activity at the glucagon receptor, but the enhanced activity is no more than 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon or of a corresponding glucagon related peptide having the same amino acid sequence as the peptide comprising the glutamine analog, except for the modified amino acid at \nposition\n 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the glutamine analog is a naturally occurring or a non-naturally occurring amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure I, II or III:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein R\n1 \nis C\n0-3 \nalkyl or C\n0-3 \nheteroalkyl; R\n2 \nis NHR\n4 \nor C\n1-3 \nalkyl; R\n3 \nis C\n1-3 \nalkyl; R\n4 \nis H or C\n1-3 \nalkyl; X is NH, O, or S; and Y is NHR\n4\n, SR\n3\n, or OR\n3\n. In some embodiments, X is NH or Y is NHR\n4\n. In some embodiments, R\n1 \nis C\n0-2 \nalkyl or C\n1 \nheteroalkyl. In some embodiments, R\n2 \nis NHR\n4 \nor C\n1 \nalkyl. In some embodiments, R\n4 \nis H or C\n1 \nalkyl. In exemplary embodiments in which the glucagon related peptide is a \nClass\n 1, \nClass\n 2, or \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure I is provided where, R\n1 \nis CH—S, X is NH, and R\n2 \nis CH\n3 \n(acetamidomethyl-cysteine, C(Acm)); R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n, X is NH, and R\n2 \nis CH\n3 \n(acetyldiaminobutanoic acid, Dab(Ac)); R\n1 \nis C\n0 \nalkyl, X is NH, R\n2 \nis NHR\n4\n, and R\n4 \nis H (carbamoyldiaminopropanoic acid, Dap(urea)); or R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n, X is NH, and R\n2 \nis CH\n3 \n(acetylornithine, Orn(Ac)). In exemplary embodiments an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure II is provided where, R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n, Y is NHR\n4\n, and R\n4 \nis CH\n3 \n(methylglutamine, Q(Me)); In exemplary embodiments an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure IIII is provided where, R\n1 \nis CH\n2 \nand R\n4 \nis H (methionine-sulfoxide, M(O)); In specific embodiments, the amino acid at \nposition\n 3 is substituted with Dab(Ac).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDimers\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to the \nClass\n 1, \nClass\n 2, and \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides, the glucagon related peptide may be part of a dimer, trimer or higher order multimer comprising at least two, three, or more peptides bound via a linker, wherein at least one or both peptides is a glucagon related peptide. The dimer may be a homodimer or heterodimer. In some embodiments, the linker is selected from the group consisting of a bifunctional thiol crosslinker and a bi-functional amine crosslinker. In certain embodiments, the linker is PEG, e.g., a 5 kDa PEG, 20 kDa PEG. In some embodiments, the linker is a disulfide bond. For example, each monomer of the dimer may comprise a Cys residue (e.g., a terminal or internally positioned Cys) and the sulfur atom of each Cys residue participates in the formation of the disulfide bond. In some aspects of the invention, the monomers are connected via terminal amino acids (e.g., N-terminal or C-terminal), via internal amino acids, or via a terminal amino acid of at least one monomer and an internal amino acid of at least one other monomer. In specific aspects, the monomers are not connected via an N-terminal amino acid. In some aspects, the monomers of the multimer are attached together in a “tail-to-tail” orientation in which the C-terminal amino acids of each monomer are attached together. A conjugate moiety may be covalently linked to any of the glucagon related peptides described herein, including a dimer, trimer or higher order multimer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for Making Glucagon Related Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glucagon related peptides (and prodrugs) of this disclosed herein may be prepared by standard synthetic methods, recombinant DNA techniques, or any other methods of preparing peptides and fusion proteins. Although certain non-natural amino acids cannot be expressed by standard recombinant DNA techniques, techniques for their preparation are known in the art. Compounds of this invention that encompass non-peptide portions may be synthesized by standard organic chemistry reactions, in addition to standard peptide chemistry reactions when applicable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClasses of glucagon related peptides are described in detail below. With respect to each of the sections of \n \n \n \n \ndisclosure concerning class\n \n \n \n \n 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 glucagon related peptides modifications are described with respect to the glucagon related peptide portion (Q) of a prodrug compound detailed above. Thus, structural elements described with regard to a class of glucagon related peptides are structural elements of Q which is then further modified to generate a prodrug compound as described above.\n\n\n \n \nClass\n 1 Glucagon Related Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the glucagon related peptide is a \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide, which is described herein and in International Patent Application No. PCT US2009/47437 (filed on Jun. 16, 2009), International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2008/086086, published on Jul. 17, 2008, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/090,415, the contents of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biological sequences referenced in the following section (SEQ ID NOs: 801-915) relating to \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides correspond to SEQ ID NOs: 1-115 in International Patent Application No. PCT US2009/47437.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivity\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nClass\n 1 glucagon peptides retain glucagon receptor activity relative to the native glucagon peptide (SEQ ID NO: 801). For example, the glucagon peptide can retain at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75% activity, 80% activity, 85% activity, or 90% of the activity of native glucagon (calculated as the inverse ratio of EC50s for the glucagon peptide vs. glucagon, e.g., as measured by cAMP production using the assay generally described in Example 5). In some embodiments, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides have the same or greater activity (used synonymously with the term “potency” herein) than glucagon. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit no more than about 100%, 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides described herein may exhibit an EC50 at the human glucagon receptor of about 100 nM, 75 nM, 50 nM, 40 nM, 30 nM, 20 nM, 10 nM, 5 nM, 1 nM or less when tested for cAMP induction in HEK293 cells over-expressing glucagon receptor, e.g. using the assay of Example 5. Typically pegylated peptides will exhibit a higher EC50 compared to the unpegylated peptide. For example, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides described herein, when unpegylated, may exhibit activity at the glucagon receptor which is at least 20% (e.g., at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90% at least 95%, at least 98%, at least 99%, 100%, 150%, 200%, 400%, 500% or more) of the activity of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 801) at the glucagon receptor. In certain embodiments, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides described herein exhibit the indicated % activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, when lacking a hydrophilic moiety, but exhibit a decreased % activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, when comprising a hydrophilic moiety. For example, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides described herein, when pegylated, may exhibit activity at the glucagon receptor which is at least 2% (e.g. at least 3%, at least 4%, at least 5%, at least 6%, at least 7%, at least 8%, at least 9%, or at least 10% of the activity of native glucagon. In some embodiments, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides described herein may exhibit any of the above indicated activities but no more than 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides exhibit less than about 5%, 4%, 3%, 2% or 1% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor and/or a greater than about 5-fold, 10-fold, or 15-fold selectivity for glucagon receptor compared to GLP-1 receptor. For example, in some embodiments, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides exhibit less than 5% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor and exhibit a greater than 5-fold selectivity for glucagon receptor compared to GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \nImproved Solubility\n\n\n \n \n \nNative glucagon exhibits poor solubility in aqueous solution, particularly at physiological pH, with a tendency to aggregate and precipitate over time. In contrast, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides in some embodiments exhibit at least 2-fold, 5-fold, or even higher solubility compared to native glucagon at a pH between 6 and 8, or between 6 and 9, for example, at pH 7 after 24 hours at 25° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in some embodiments, a \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide has been modified relative to the wild type peptide of His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr (SEQ ID NO: 801) to improve the peptide's solubility in aqueous solutions, particularly at a pH ranging from about 5.5 to about 8.0, while retaining the native peptide's biological activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the solubility of any of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides described herein can be further improved by attaching a hydrophilic moiety to the peptide. Introduction of such groups also increases duration of action, e.g. as measured by a prolonged half-life in circulation. Hydrophilic moieties are further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModification with Charged Residues\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, solubility is improved by adding charge to the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide by the substitution of native non-charged amino acids with charged amino acids selected from the group consisting of lysine, arginine, histidine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid, or by the addition of charged amino acids to the amino or carboxy terminus of the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide has improved solubility due to the fact that the peptide is modified by amino acid substitutions and/or additions that introduce a charged amino acid into the C-terminal portion of the peptide, and in some embodiments at a position C-terminal to position 27 of SEQ ID NO: 801. Optionally, one, two or three charged amino acids may be introduced within the C-terminal portion, and in some embodiments C-terminal to position 27. In accordance with some embodiments, the native amino acid(s) at positions 28 and/or 29 are substituted with a charged amino acid, and/or one to three charged amino acids are added to the C-terminus of the peptide, e.g. after \n \nposition\n \n 27, 28 or 29. In exemplary embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. In other embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are positively charged.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn specific exemplary embodiments, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide may comprise any one or two of the following modifications: substitution of N28 with E; substitution of N28 with D; substitution of T29 with D; substitution of T29 with E; insertion of E after \n \nposition\n \n 27, 28 or 29; insertion of D after \n \nposition\n \n 27, 28 or 29. For example, D28E29, E28E29, E29E30, E28E30, D28E30.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one exemplary embodiment, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide comprises an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 811, or an analog thereof that contains 1 to 3 further amino acid modifications (described herein in reference to glucagon agonists) relative to native glucagon, or a glucagon agonist analog thereof. SEQ ID NO: 811 represents a modified \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide, wherein the asparagine residue at position 28 of the native protein has been substituted with an aspartic acid. In another exemplary embodiment the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide comprises an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 838, wherein the asparagine residue at position 28 of the native protein has been substituted with glutamic acid. Other exemplary embodiments include \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides of SEQ ID NOS: 824, 825, 826, 833, 835, 836 and 837.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstituting the normally occurring amino acid at position 28 and/or 29 with charged amino acids, and/or the addition of one to two charged amino acids at the carboxy terminus of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide, enhances the solubility and stability of the glucagon peptides in aqueous solutions at physiologically relevant pHs (i.e., a pH of about 6.5 to about 7.5) by at least 5-fold and by as much as 30-fold. Accordingly, \nClass\n 1 glucagon peptides of some embodiments retain glucagon activity and exhibit at least 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 25-fold, 30-fold or greater solubility relative to native glucagon at a given pH between about 5.5 and 8, e.g., pH 7, when measured after 24 hours at 25° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional modifications, e.g. conservative substitutions, which modifications are further described herein, may be made to the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide that still allow it to retain glucagon activity.\n\n\n \nImproved Stability\n\n\n \n \n \nAny of the Class 1 glucagon peptides may additionally exhibit improved stability and/or reduced degradation, for example, retaining at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. Any of the Class 1 glucagon related peptides disclosed herein may additionally exhibit improved stability at a pH within the range of 5.5 to 8, for example, retaining at least 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. In some embodiments, the Class 1 glucagon related peptides of the invention exhibit improved stability, such that at least 75% (e.g., at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, more than 95%, up to 100%) of a concentration of the peptide or less than about 25% (e.g., less than 20%, less than 15%, less than 10%, less than 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, down to 0%) of degraded peptide is detectable at 280 nm by an ultraviolet (UV) detector after about 1 or more weeks (e.g., about 2 weeks, about 4 weeks, about 1 month, about two months, about four months, about six months, about eight months, about ten months, about twelve months) in solution at a temperature of at least 20° C. (e.g., 21° C., 22° C., 23° C., 24° C., 25° C., 26° C., at least 27.5° C., at least 30° C., at least 35° C., at least 40° C., at least 50° C.) and less than 100° C., less than 85° C., less than 75° C., or less than 70° C. The Class 1 glucagon related peptides may include additional modifications that alter its pharmaceutical properties, e.g. increased potency, prolonged half-life in circulation, increased shelf-life, reduced precipitation or aggregation, and/or reduced degradation, e.g., reduced occurrence of cleavage or chemical modification after storage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet further exemplary embodiments, any of the foregoing \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides can be further modified to improve stability by modifying the amino acid at \nposition\n 15 of SEQ ID NO: 801 to reduce degradation of the peptide over time, especially in acidic or alkaline buffers. In exemplary embodiments, Asp at \nposition\n 15 is substituted with a Glu, homo-Glu, cysteic acid, or homo-cysteic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, any of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides described herein can be further modified to improve stability by modifying the amino acid at position 16 of SEQ ID NO: 801. In exemplary embodiments, Ser at position 16 is substituted with Thr or AIB, or any of the amino acids substitutions described herein with regard to \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides which enhance potency at the glucagon receptor. Such modifications reduce cleavage of the peptide bond between Asp15-Ser16.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, any of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides described herein can be further modified to reduce degradation at various amino acid positions by modifying any one, two, three, or all four of \n \npositions\n \n 20, 21, 24, or 27. Exemplary embodiments include substitution of Gln at \nposition\n 20 with Ser, Thr, Ala or AIB, substitution of Asp at position 21 with Glu, substitution of Gln at position 24 with Ala or AIB, substitution of Met at \nposition\n 27 with Leu or Nle. Removal or substitution of methionine reduces degradation due to oxidation of the methionine. Removal or substitution of Gln or Asn reduces degradation due to deamidation of Gln or Asn. Removal or substitution of Asp reduces degradation that occurs through dehydration of Asp to form a cyclic succinimide intermediate followed by isomerization to iso-aspartate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced Potency\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with another embodiment, \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptides are provided that have enhanced potency at the glucagon receptor, wherein the peptides comprise an amino acid modification at position 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 801). By way of nonlimiting example, such enhanced potency can be provided by substituting the naturally occurring serine at position 16 with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid, or a charged amino acid having a side chain containing at least one heteroatom, (e.g. N, O, S, P) and with a side chain length of about 4 (or 3-5) atoms. Substitution of serine at position 16 with glutamic acid enhances glucagon activity at least 2-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold and up to 10-fold greater at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide retains selectivity for the glucagon receptor relative to the GLP-1 receptors, e.g., at least 5-fold, 10-fold, or 15-fold selectivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDPP-IV Resistance\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon peptides disclosed herein are further modified at \n \nposition\n \n 1 or 2 to reduce susceptibility to cleavage by dipeptidyl peptidase IV. More particularly, in some embodiments, \nposition\n 1 and/or \nposition\n 2 of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide is substituted with the DPP-IV resistant amino acid(s) described herein. In some embodiments, \nposition\n 2 of the analog peptide is substituted with an amino isobutyric acid. In some embodiments, \nposition\n 2 of the analog peptide is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D-serine, D-alanine, glycine, N-methyl serine, and ε-amino butyric acid. In another embodiment, \nposition\n 2 of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D-serine, glycine, and aminoisobutyric acid. In some embodiments, the amino acid at \nposition\n 2 is not D-serine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReduction in glucagon activity upon modification of the amino acids at \nposition\n 1 and/or \nposition\n 2 of the glucagon peptide can be restored by stabilization of the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29). The alpha helix structure can be stabilized by, e.g., formation of a covalent or non-covalent intramolecular bridge (e.g., a lactam bridge between side chains of amino acids at positions “i” and “i+4”, wherein i is an integer from 12 to 25), substitution and/or insertion of amino acids around positions 12-29 with an alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid (e.g., an α,α-disubstituted amino acid), as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications at \nPosition\n 3\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon receptor activity can be reduced by an amino acid modification at position 3 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon), e.g. substitution of the naturally occurring glutamine at \nposition\n 3, with an acidic, basic, or a hydrophobic amino acid. For example substitution at \nposition\n 3 with glutamic acid, ornithine, or norleucine substantially reduces or destroys glucagon receptor activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaintained or enhanced activity at the glucagon receptor may be achieved by modifying the Gln at \nposition\n 3 with a glutamine analog as described herein. For example, glucagon agonists can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 863, SEQ ID NO: 869, SEQ ID NO: 870, SEQ ID NO: 871, SEQ ID NO: 872, SEQ ID NO: 873, and SEQ ID NO: 874.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhancing GLP-1 Activity with C-terminal Amides and Esters\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by replacing the carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester. Conversely, retaining the native carboxylic acid at the C-terminus of the peptide maintains the relatively greater selectivity of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide for the glucagon receptor vs. the GLP-1 receptor (e.g., greater than about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20-fold).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther Modifications and Combinations\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional modifications may be made to the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide which may further increase solubility and/or stability and/or glucagon activity. The \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide may alternatively comprise other modifications that do not substantially affect solubility or stability, and that do not substantially decrease glucagon activity. In exemplary embodiments, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide may comprise a total of up to 11, or up to 12, or up to 13, or up to 14 amino acid modifications relative to the native glucagon sequence. For example, conservative or non-conservative substitutions, additions or deletions may be carried out at any of \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n 2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28 or 29.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary modifications of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related peptide include but are not limited to:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) non-conservative substitutions, conservative substitutions, additions or deletions while retaining at least partial glucagon agonist activity, for example, conservative substitutions at one or more of \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n 2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28 or 29, substitution of Tyr at \nposition\n 10 with Val or Phe, substitution of Lys at position 12 with Arg, substitution of one or more of these positions with Ala;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) deletion of amino acids at \npositions\n 29 and/or 28, and optionally position 27, while retaining at least partial glucagon agonist activity;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) modification of the aspartic acid at \nposition\n 15, for example, by substitution with glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, cysteic acid or homocysteic acid, which may reduce degradation;

Other modifications disclosed herein in reference to a \nClass\n 2 glucagon related peptide prolong the half-life, increase solubility, or increase stability of the resulting peptide. Yet other modifications disclosed herein in reference to a \nClass\n 2 glucagon related peptide have no effect on activity, or can be made without destroying the desired activity or activities. Any of the combinations in reference to a \nClass\n 2 glucagon related peptide that serve the same purpose (e.g. increasing GIP activity) can be applied individually or in combination. Any of the single or sets of combinations in reference to a \nClass\n 2 glucagon related peptide that confer enhanced properties can be applied individually or in combination, e.g. increased GIP and/or GLP-1 activity can be combined with increased half-life. In related embodiments, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more of the amino acid modifications may be non-conservative substitutions, additions or deletions. In some embodiments, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more of the amino acid modifications may be conservative substitutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications that Affect GIP Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GIP receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 1. For example, His at \nposition\n 1 is substituted with a large, aromatic amino acid, optionally Tyr, Phe, Trp, amino-Phe, nitro-Phe, chloro-Phe, sulfo-Phe, 4-pyridyl-Ala, methyl-Tyr, or 3-amino Tyr. The combination of Tyr at \nposition\n 1 with stabilization of the alpha helix within the region corresponding to amino acids 12-29 provided a \nClass\n 2 glucagon related peptide that activates the GIP receptor as well as the GLP-1 receptor and the glucagon receptor. The alpha helix structure can be stabilized by, e.g., formation of a covalent or non-covalent intramolecular bridge, or substitution and/or insertion of amino acids around positions 12-29 with an alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid (e.g., an α,α-disubstituted amino acid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GIP receptor is also provided by amino acid modifications at \npositions\n 27 and/or 28, and optionally at \nposition\n 29. For example, the Met at \nposition\n 27 is substituted with a large aliphatic amino acid, optionally Leu, the Asn at position 28 is substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally Ala, and the Thr at \nposition\n 29 is substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally Gly. Substitution with LAG at positions 27-29 provides increased GIP activity relative to the native MNT sequence at those positions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GIP receptor is also provided by an amino acid modification at position 12. For example, position 12 is substituted with a large, aliphatic, nonpolar amino acid, optionally Ile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GIP receptor is also provided by an amino acid modification at positions 17 and/or 18. For example, position 17 is substituted with a polar residue, optionally Gln, and position 18 is substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally Ala. A substitution with QA at positions 17 and 18 provides increased GIP activity relative to the native RR sequence at those positions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GIP receptor is provided by modifications that permit formation of an intramolecular bridge between amino acid side chains at positions from 12 to 29. For example, an intramolecular bridge can be formed by a covalent bond between the side chains of two amino acids at positions i and i+4 or between positions j and j+3, or between positions k and k+7. In exemplary embodiments, the bridge is between \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24, 24 and 28, or 17 and 20. In other embodiments, non-covalent interactions such as salt bridges can be formed between positively and negatively charged amino acids at these positions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the modifications described above which increase GIP receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Combinations of the modifications that increase GIP receptor activity generally provide higher GIP activity than any of such modifications taken alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications that Affect Glucagon Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, enhanced glucagon potency is provided by an amino acid modification at position 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1001). By way of nonlimiting example, such enhanced potency can be provided by substituting the naturally occurring serine at position 16 with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid, or a charged amino acid having a side chain containing at least one heteroatom, (e.g. N, O, S, P) and with a side chain length of about 4 (or 3-5) atoms. In some embodiments the glucagon peptide retains its original selectivity for the glucagon receptor relative to the GLP-1 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon receptor activity can be reduced by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 3, e.g. substitution of the naturally occurring glutamine at \nposition\n 3, with an acidic, basic, or a hydrophobic amino acid. For example substitution at \nposition\n 3 with glutamic acid, ornithine, or norleucine substantially reduces or destroys glucagon receptor activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaintained or enhanced activity at the glucagon receptor may be achieved by modifying the Gln at \nposition\n 3 with a glutamine analog, as described herein. For example, glucagon agonists can comprise the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1243-1248, 1250, 1251, and 1253-1256.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRestoration of glucagon activity which has been reduced by amino acid modifications at \n \npositions\n \n 1 and 2 is provided by modifications that that stabilize the alpha helix structure of the C-terminal portion (amino acids 12-29) of the glucagon peptide or analog thereof. For example, an intramolecular bridge can be formed by a covalent bond between the side chains of two amino acids at positions i and i+4 or between positions j and j+3, or between positions k and k+7. In other embodiments, non-covalent interactions such as salt bridges can be formed between positively and negatively charged amino acids at these positions. In yet other embodiments, one or more α,α-disubstituted amino acids are inserted or substituted into this C-terminal portion (amino acids 12-29) at positions that retain the desired activity. For example, one, two, three or all of \npositions\n 16, 20, 21 or 24 are substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications that Affect GLP-1 Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by replacing the carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is also provided by stabilizing the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (around amino acids 12-29), e.g., through formation of an intramolecular bridge between the side chains of two amino acids, or substitution and/or insertion of amino acids around positions 12-29 with an alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid (e.g., an α,α-disubstituted amino acid), as further described herein. In exemplary embodiments, the side chains of the amino acid pairs 12 and 16, 13 and 17, 16 and 20, 17 and 21, 20 and 24 or 24 and 28 (amino acid pairs in which i=12, 16, 20, or 24) are linked to one another and thus stabilize the glucagon alpha helix. In some embodiments, the bridge or linker is about 8 (or about 7-9) atoms in length, particularly when the bridge is between positions i and i+4. In some embodiments, the bridge or linker is about 6 (or about 5-7) atoms in length, particularly when the bridge is between positions j and j+3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, intramolecular bridges are formed by (a) substituting the naturally occurring serine at position 16 with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid, or a charged amino acid having a side chain containing at least one heteroatom, (e.g. N, O, S, P) and with a side chain length of about 4 (or 3-5) atoms, and (b) substituting the naturally occurring glutamine at \nposition\n 20 with another hydrophilic amino acid having a side chain that is either charged or has an ability to hydrogen-bond, and is at least about 5 (or about 4-6) atoms in length, for example, lysine, citrulline, arginine, or ornithine. The side chains of such amino acids at \npositions\n 16 and 20 can form a salt bridge or can be covalently linked. In some embodiments the two amino acids are bound to one another to form a lactam ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, stabilization of the alpha helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide is achieved through the formation of an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified sulfur-containing bridge formation, the use of α, ω-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization are used to stabilize the alpha helix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, one or more α,α-disubstituted amino acids are inserted or substituted into this C-terminal portion (amino acids 12-29) at positions that retain the desired activity. For example, one, two, three or all of \npositions\n 16, 20, 21 or 24 are substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 20 as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by adding GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 1095) or XGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 1096) to the C-terminus. GLP-1 activity in such analogs can be further increased by modifying the amino acid at \nposition\n 18, 28 or 29, or at \nposition\n 18 and 29, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further modest increase in GLP-1 potency is provided by modifying the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 to be a large, aromatic amino acid residue, optionally Trp.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReduced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided, e.g., by an amino acid modification at position 7 as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPotency at the GLP-1 receptor can be further enhanced by an alanine substitution for the native arginine at position 18.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the modifications described above in reference to a \nClass\n 2 glucagon related peptide which increase GLP-1 receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Combinations of the modifications that increase GLP-1 receptor activity generally provide higher GLP-1 activity than any of such modifications taken alone. For example, the invention provides glucagon peptides that comprise modifications at position 16, at \nposition\n 20, and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group, optionally with a covalent bond between the amino acids at \npositions\n 16 and 20; glucagon peptides that comprise modifications at position 16 and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group; glucagon peptides that comprise modifications at \npositions\n 16 and 20, optionally with a covalent bond between the amino acids at \npositions\n 16 and 20; and glucagon peptides that comprise modifications at \nposition\n 20 and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications that Improve DPP-IV Resistance\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications at \nposition\n 1 and/or 2 can increase the peptide's resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) cleavage. For example, \nposition\n 1 and/or \nposition\n 2 may be substituted with a DPP-IV resistant amino acid as described herein. In some embodiments, the amino acid at \nposition\n 2 is substituted with N-methyl alanine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was observed that modifications at position 2 (e.g. AIB at position 2) and in some cases modifications at position 1 (e.g., DMIA at position 1) may reduce glucagon activity, sometimes significantly; surprisingly, this reduction in glucagon activity can be restored by stabilizing the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (around amino acids 12-29), e.g., through formation of a covalent bond between the side chains of two amino acids, as described herein. In some embodiments, the covalent bond is between amino acids at positions “i” and “i+4”, or positions “j” and “j+3”, e.g., between \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24, 24 and 28, or 17 and 20. In exemplary embodiments, this covalent bond is a lactam bridge between a glutamic acid at position 16 and a lysine at \nposition\n 20. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications that Reduce Degradation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet further exemplary embodiments, any of the \nClass\n 2 glucagon related peptides can be further modified to improve stability by modifying the amino acid at \nposition\n 15 and/or 16 of SEQ ID NO: 1001 to reduce degradation of the peptide over time, especially in acidic or alkaline buffers. Such modifications reduce cleavage of the Asp15-Ser16 peptide bond. In exemplary embodiments, the amino acid modification at \nposition\n 15 is a deletion or substitution of Asp with glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, cysteic acid or homocysteic acid. In other exemplary embodiments, the amino acid modification at position 16 is a deletion or substitution of Ser with Thr or AIB. In other exemplary embodiments, Ser at position 16 is substituted with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the methionine residue present at \nposition\n 27 of the native peptide is modified, e.g. by deletion or substitution. Such modifications may prevent oxidative degradation of the peptide. In some embodiments, the Met at \nposition\n 27 is substituted with leucine, isoleucine or norleucine. In some specific embodiments, Met at \nposition\n 27 is substituted with leucine or norleucine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the Gln at \nposition\n 20 and/or 24 is modified, e.g. by deletion or substitution. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through deamidation of Gln. In some embodiments, the Gln at \nposition\n 20 and/or 24 is substituted with Ser, Thr, Ala or AIB. In some embodiments the Gln at \nposition\n 20 and/or 24 is substituted with Lys, Arg, Orn, or Citrulline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the Asp at position 21 is modified, e.g. by deletion or substitution. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through dehydration of Asp to form a cyclic succinimide intermediate followed by isomerization to iso-aspartate. In some embodiments, position 21 is substituted with Glu, homoglutamic acid or homocysteic acid. In some specific embodiments, position 21 is substituted with Glu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStabilization of the Alpha Helix Structure\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStabilization of the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the \nClass\n 2 glucagon related peptide (around amino acids 12-29) provides enhanced GLP-1 and/or GIP activity and restores glucagon activity which has been reduced by amino acid modifications at \npositions\n 1 and/or 2. The alpha helix structure can be stabilized by, e.g., formation of a covalent or non-covalent intramolecular bridge, or substitution and/or insertion of amino acids around positions 12-29 with an alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid (e.g., an α,α-disubstituted amino acid). Stabilization of the alpha-helix structure of a GIP agonist may be accomplished as described herein.\n\n\n \nAcylation and Alkylation\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are modified to comprise an acyl group or alkyl group, e.g., an acyl or alkyl group which is non-native to a naturally-occurring amino acid as described herein. Acylation or alkylation can increase the half-life of the glucagon peptides in circulation. Acylation or alkylation can advantageously delay the onset of action and/or extend the duration of action at the glucagon and/or GLP-1 receptors and/or improve resistance to proteases such as DPP-IV and/or improve solubility. Activity at the glucagon and/or GLP-1 and/or GIP receptors of the glucagon peptide may be maintained after acylation. In some embodiments, the potency of the acylated glucagon peptides is comparable to the unacylated versions of the glucagon peptides. \nClass\n 2 glucagon related peptides may be acylated or alkylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the invention provides a glucagon peptide modified to comprise an acyl group or alkyl group covalently linked to the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide. The glucagon peptide may further comprise a spacer between the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide and the acyl group or alkyl group. In some embodiments, the acyl group is a fatty acid or bile acid, or salt thereof, e.g. a C4 to C30 fatty acid, a C8 to C24 fatty acid, cholic acid, a C4 to C30 alkyl, a C8 to C24 alkyl, or an alkyl comprising a steroid moiety of a bile acid. The spacer is any moiety with suitable reactive groups for attaching acyl or alkyl groups. In exemplary embodiments, the spacer comprises an amino acid, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a hydrophilic bifunctional, or a hydrophobic bifunctional spacer. In some embodiments, the spacer is selected from the group consisting of: Trp, Glu, Asp, Cys and a spacer comprising NH\n2\n(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)n(CH\n2\n)mCOOH, wherein m is any integer from 1 to 6 and n is any integer from 2 to 12. Such acylated or alkylated glucagon peptides may also further comprise a hydrophilic moiety, optionally a polyethylene glycol. Any of the foregoing glucagon peptides may comprise two acyl groups or two alkyl groups, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates and Fusions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe GIP agonist can be linked, optionally via covalent bonding and optionally via a linker, to a conjugate moiety as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the second peptide is XGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 1096), wherein X is selected from one of the 20 common amino acids, e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid or glycine. In some embodiments X represents an amino acid, for example Cys, that further comprises a hydrophilic moiety covalently linked to the side chain of that amino acid. Such C-terminal extensions improve solubility and also can improve GIP or GLP-1 activity. In some embodiments wherein the glucagon peptide further comprises a carboxy terminal extension, the carboxy terminal amino acid of the extension ends in an amide group or an ester group rather than a carboxylic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, e.g., in glucagon peptides which comprise the C-terminal extension, the threonine at \nposition\n 29 of the native glucagon peptide is replaced with a glycine. For example, a glucagon peptide having a glycine substitution for threonine at \nposition\n 29 and comprising the C-terminal extension of GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 1095) is four times as potent at the GLP-1 receptor as native glucagon modified to comprise the same C-terminal extension. This T29G substitution can be used in conjunction with other modifications disclosed herein to enhance the affinity of the glucagon peptides for the GLP-1 receptor. For example, the T29G substitution can be combined with the S16E and N20K amino acid substitutions, optionally with a lactam bridge between \namino acids\n 16 and 20, and optionally with addition of a PEG chain as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments an amino acid is added to the C-terminus, and the additional amino acid is selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid, aspartic acid and glycine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications that Enhance Solubility\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the solubility of any of the glucagon peptides can be improved by amino acid substitutions and/or additions that introduce a charged amino acid into the C-terminal portion of the peptide, preferably at a position C-terminal to position 27 of SEQ ID NO: 1001. Optionally, one, two or three charged amino acids may be introduced within the C-terminal portion, preferably C-terminal to position 27. In some embodiments the native amino acid(s) at positions 28 and/or 29 are substituted with one or two charged amino acids, and/or in a further embodiment one to three charged amino acids are also added to the C-terminus of the peptide. In exemplary embodiments, one, two or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. In some embodiments, the negatively charged (acidic amino acid) is aspartic acid or glutamic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional modifications, e.g. conservative substitutions, may be made to the glucagon peptide that still allow it to retain GIP activity (and optionally GLP-1 activity and/or glucagon activity).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther Modifications\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the modifications described above in reference to a \nClass\n 2 peptide which increase or decrease GIP activity, which increase or decrease glucagon receptor activity, and which increase GLP-1 receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Any of the modifications described above in reference to a \nClass\n 2 glucagon related peptide can also be combined with other modifications that confer other desirable properties, such as increased solubility and/or stability and/or duration of action, as described herein with regard to \nClass\n 2 glucagon related peptides. Alternatively, any of the modifications described above in reference to \nClass\n 2 glucaton related peptides can be combined with other modifications described herein in reference to \nClass\n 2 glucagon related peptides that do not substantially affect solubility or stability or activity. Exemplary modifications include but are not limited to:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(A) Improving solubility, for example, by introducing one, two, three or more charged amino acid(s) to the C-terminal portion of native glucagon, preferably at a position C-terminal to position 27. Such a charged amino acid can be introduced by substituting a native amino acid with a charged amino acid, e.g. at \npositions\n 28 or 29, or alternatively by adding a charged amino acid, e.g. after \n \nposition\n \n 27, 28 or 29. In exemplary embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. In other embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are positively charged. Such modifications increase solubility, e.g. provide at least 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 25-fold, 30-fold or greater solubility relative to native glucagon at a given pH between about 5.5 and 8, e.g., pH 7, when measured after 24 hours at 25° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(B) Increasing solubility and duration of action or half-life in circulation by addition of a hydrophilic moiety such as a polyethylene glycol chain, as described herein, e.g. at \n \nposition\n \n 16, 17, 20, 21, 24 or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminal amino acid of the peptide,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(C) Increasing solubility and/or duration of action or half-life in circulation and/or delaying the onset of action by acylation or alkylation of the glucagon peptide, as described herein;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(D) Increasing duration of action or half-life in circulation through introducing resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) cleavage by modification of the amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 1 or 2 as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(E) Increasing stability by modification of the Asp at \nposition\n 15, for example, by deletion or substitution with glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, cysteic acid or homocysteic acid. Such modifications can reduce degradation or cleavage at a pH within the range of 5.5 to 8, for example, retaining at least 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%, up to 100% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. Such modifications reduce cleavage of the peptide bond between Asp15-Ser16.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(F) Increasing stability by modification of the Ser at position 16, for example by substitution with Thr or AIB. Such modifications also reduce cleavage of the peptide bond between Asp15-Ser16.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(G) Increasing stability by modification of the methionine at \nposition\n 27, for example, by substitution with leucine or norleucine. Such modifications can reduce oxidative degradation. Stability can also be increased by modification of the Gln at \nposition\n 20 or 24, e.g. by substitution with Ser, Thr, Ala or AIB. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through deamidation of Gln. Stability can be increased by modification of Asp at position 21, e.g. by substitution with Glu. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through dehydration of Asp to form a cyclic succinimide intermediate followed by isomerization to iso-aspartate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(H) Non-conservative or conservative substitutions, additions or deletions that do not substantially affect activity, for example, conservative substitutions at one or more of \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28 or 29; substitution of one or more of these positions with Ala; deletion of amino acids at one or more of \n \npositions\n \n 27, 28 or 29; or deletion of \namino acid\n 29 optionally combined with a C-terminal amide or ester in place of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group; substitution of Lys at position 12 with Arg; substitution of Tyr at \nposition\n 10 with Val or Phe;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreservation of activity after pegylation is provided by the addition of GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 1095) to the C-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome positions of the native glucagon peptide can be modified while retaining at least some of the activities of the parent peptide. Accordingly, applicants anticipate that one or more of the amino acids located at positions at \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n 2, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28 or 29 can be substituted with an amino acid different from that present in the native glucagon peptide, and still retain activity at the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, position 18 is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of Ala, Ser, or Thr. In some embodiments the amino acid at \nposition\n 20 is substituted with Ser, Thr, Lys, Arg, Orn, Citrulline or AIB. In some embodiments, position 21 is substituted with Glu, homoglutamic acid or homocysteic acid. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide comprises 1 to 10 amino acid modifications selected from \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 27, 28 and 29. In exemplary embodiments, the modifications are one or more amino acid substitutions selected from the group consisting of Gln17, Ala18, Glu21, Ile23, Ala24, Val27 and Gly29. In some embodiments, 1 to 2 amino acids selected from positions 17-26 differ from the parent peptide. In other embodiments, 1 to 2 amino acids selected from positions 17-22 differ from the parent peptide. In yet other embodiments, the modifications are Gln17, Ala18, Glu21, Ile23 and Ala24.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more amino acids is added to the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide. The amino acid is typically selected from one of the 20 common amino acids, and in some embodiments the amino acid has an amide group in place of the carboxylic acid of the native amino acid. In exemplary embodiments the added amino acid is selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid and aspartic acid and glycine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther modifications that do not destroy activity include W10 or R20.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the \nClass\n 2 glucagon related peptides disclosed herein are modified by truncation of the C-terminus by one or two amino acid residues yet retain similar activity and potency at the glucagon, GLP-1 and/or GIP receptors. In this regard, the amino acid at \nposition\n 29 and/or 28 can be deleted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary Embodiments\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the analog of glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1001) having GIP agonist activity comprises SEQ ID NO: 1001 with (a) an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 1 that confers GIP agonist activity, (b) a modification which stabilizes the alpha helix structure of the C-terminal portion (amino acids 12-29) of the analog, and (c) optionally, 1 to 10 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) further amino acid modifications. In some embodiments, the analog exhibits at least about 1% activity of native GIP at the GIP receptor or any other activity level at the GIP receptor described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the modification which stabilizes the alpha helix structure is one which provides or introduces an intramolecular bridge, including, for example, a covalent intramolecular bridge, such as any of those described herein. The covalent intramolecular bridge in some embodiments is a lactam bridge. The lactam bridge of the analog of these embodiments can be a lactam bridge as described herein. See, e.g., the teachings of lactam bridges under the section “Stabilization of the Alpha Helix Structure.” For example, the lactam bridge may be one which is between the side chains of amino acids at positions i and i+4 or between the side chains of amino acids at positions j and j+3, wherein i is 12, 13, 16, 17, 20 or 24, and wherein j is 17. In certain embodiments, the lactam bridge can be between the amino acids at \npositions\n 16 and 20, wherein one of the amino acids at \npositions\n 16 and 20 is substituted with Glu and the other of the amino acids at \npositions\n 16 and 20 is substituted with Lys.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn alternative embodiments, the modification which stabilizes the alpha helix structure is the introduction of one, two, three, or four α,α-disubstituted amino acids at position(s) 16, 20, 21, and 24 of the analog. In some embodiments, the α,α-disubstituted amino acid is AIB. In certain aspects, the α,α-disubstituted amino acid (e.g., AIB) is at \nposition\n 20 and the amino acid at position 16 is substituted with a positive-charged amino acid, such as, for example, an amino acid of Formula IV, which is described herein. The amino acid of Formula IV may be homoLys, Lys, Orn, or 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (Dab).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn specific aspects of the invention, the amino acid modification at \nposition\n 1 is a substitution of His with an amino acid lacking an imidazole side chain, e.g. a large, aromatic amino acid (e.g., Tyr).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain aspects, the analog of glucagon comprises amino acid modifications at one, two or all of \n \npositions\n \n 27, 28 and 29. For example, the Met at \nposition\n 27 can be substituted with a large aliphatic amino acid, optionally Leu, the Asn at position 28 can be substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally Ala, the Thr at \nposition\n 29 can be substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally Gly, or a combination of two or three of the foregoing. In specific embodiments, the analog of glucagon comprises Leu at \nposition\n 27, Ala at position 28, and Gly or Thr at \nposition\n 29.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention, the analog of glucagon comprises an extension of 1 to 21 amino acids C-terminal to the amino acid at \nposition\n 29. The extension can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1095 or 1096, for instance. Additionally or alternatively, the analog of glucagon can comprise an extension of which 1-6 amino acids of the extension are positive-charged amino acids. The positive-charged amino acids may be amino acids of Formula IV, including, but not limited to Lys, homoLys, Orn, and Dab.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe analog of glucagon in some embodiments is acylated or alkylated as described herein.

In addition, in some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide has lost native glucagon's selectivity for the glucagon receptor verses the GLP-1 receptor, and thus represents co-agonists of those two receptors. Selected amino acid modifications within the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide can control the relative activity of the peptide at the GLP-1 receptor verses the glucagon receptor. Thus, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide can be a glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist that has higher activity at the glucagon receptor versus the GLP-1 receptor, a glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist that has approximately equivalent activity at both receptors, or a glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist that has higher activity at the GLP-1 receptor versus the glucagon receptor. The latter category of co-agonist can be engineered to exhibit little or no activity at the glucagon receptor, and yet retain ability to activate the GLP-1 receptor with the same or better potency than native GLP-1. Any of these co-agonists may also include modifications that confer enhanced biophysical stability and/or aqueous solubility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide can be made to produce a glucagon peptide having anywhere from at least about 1% (including at least about 1.5%, 2%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%) to about 200% or higher activity at the GLP-1 receptor relative to native GLP-1 and anywhere from at least about 1% (including about 1.5%, 2%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 350%, 400%, 450%) to about 500% or higher activity at the glucagon receptor relative to native glucagon. The amino acid sequence of native glucagon is SEQ ID NO: 1, the amino acid sequence of GLP-1(7-36)amide is SEQ ID NO: 52, and the amino acid sequence of GLP-1(7-37)acid is SEQ ID NO: 50. In exemplary embodiments, a \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide may exhibit at least 10% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least 50% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, or at least 40% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least 40% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, or at least 60% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least 60% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelectivity of a \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide for the glucagon receptor versus the GLP-1 receptor can be described as the relative ratio of glucagon/GLP-1 activity (the peptide's activity at the glucagon receptor relative to native glucagon, divided by the peptide's activity at the GLP-1 receptor relative to native GLP-1). For example, a \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide that exhibits 60% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and 60% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor has a 1:1 ratio of glucagon/GLP-1 activity. Exemplary ratios of glucagon/GLP-1 activity include about 1:1, 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1 or 10:1, or about 1:10, 1:9, 1:8, 1:7, 1:6, 1:5, 1:4, 1:3, 1:2, or 1:1.5. As an example, a glucagon/GLP-1 activity ratio of 10:1 indicates a 10-fold selectivity for the glucagon receptor versus the GLP-1 receptor. Similarly, a GLP-1/glucagon activity ratio of 10:1 indicates a 10-fold selectivity for the GLP-1 receptor versus the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides have about 10% or less of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, e.g. about 1-10%, or about 0.1-10%, or greater than about 0.1% but less than about 10%, while exhibiting at least 20% of the activity of GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor. For example, \nexemplary Class\n 3 glucagon related peptides described herein have about 0.5%, about 1% or about 7% of the activity of native glucagon, while exhibiting at least 20% of the activity of GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide can be a glucagon peptide with increased or decreased activity at the glucagon receptor, or GLP-1 receptor, or both. The \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide can be a glucagon peptide with altered selectivity for the glucagon receptor versus the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, as disclosed herein \nhigh potency Class\n 3 glucagon related peptides are provided that also exhibit improved solubility and/or stability. An exemplary high potency Class 3 glucagon related peptide exhibits at least about 200% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, and optionally is soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8, or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide (e.g. 5% or less of the original peptide is degraded or cleaved) after 24 hours at 25° C. As another example, an exemplary Class 3 glucagon related peptide exhibits greater than about 40% or greater than about 60% activity at both the glucagon and the GLP-1 receptors (at a ratio between about 1:3 and 3:1, or between about 1:2 and 2:1), is optionally soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. Another exemplary Class 3 glucagon related peptide exhibits about 175% or more of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and about 20% or less of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, is optionally soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. Yet another exemplary Class 3 glucagon related peptide exhibits about 10% or less of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least about 20% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, is optionally soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. Yet another exemplary Class 3 glucagon related peptide exhibits about 10% or less but above 0.1%, 0.5% or 1% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 100% or more of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, is optionally soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. In some embodiments, such Class 3 glucagon related peptides retain at least 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 or 28 of the naturally occurring amino acids at the corresponding positions in native glucagon (e.g. have 1-7, 1-5 or 1-3 modifications relative to naturally occurring glucagon).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications Affecting Glucagon Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the glucagon receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at position 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1). In some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide is a glucagon agonist that has been modified relative to the wild type peptide of His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr (SEQ ID NO: 1) to enhance the peptide's potency at the glucagon receptor. The normally occurring serine at position 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) can be substituted with select acidic amino acids to enhance the potency of glucagon, in terms of its ability to stimulate cAMP synthesis in a validated in vitro model assay (see Example 5). More particularly, this substitution enhances the potency of the analog at least 2-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, and up to 10-fold greater at the glucagon receptor. This substitution also enhances the analog's activity at the GLP-1 receptor at least 5-fold, 10-fold, or 15-fold relative to native glucagon, but selectivity is maintained for the glucagon receptor over the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of nonlimiting example, such enhanced potency can be provided by substituting the naturally occurring serine at position 16 with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid, or a charged amino acid having a side chain containing at least one heteroatom, (e.g. N, O, S, P) and with a side chain length of about 4 (or 3-5) atoms. In accordance with some embodiments, the serine residue at position 16 of native glucagon is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid, glutamine, homoglutamic acid, homocysteic acid, threonine, or glycine. In accordance with some embodiments, the serine residue at position 16 of native glucagon is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid, glutamine, homoglutamic acid and homocysteic acid, and in some embodiments the serine residue is substituted with glutamic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the enhanced \npotency Class\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprises a peptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7 or a glucagon agonist analog of SEQ ID NO: 5. In accordance with some embodiments, a \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide having enhanced potency at the glucagon receptor relative to wild type glucagon is provided wherein the peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10, wherein the glucagon peptide retains its selectivity for the glucagon receptor relative to the GLP-1 receptors. In some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide having enhanced specificity for the glucagon receptor comprises the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 10 or a glucagon agonist analog thereof, wherein the carboxy terminal amino acid retains its native carboxylic acid group. In accordance with some embodiments, a \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprises the sequence of NH\n2\n-His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Glu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr-COOH (SEQ ID NO: 10), wherein the peptide exhibits approximately fivefold enhanced potency at the glucagon receptor, relative to native glucagon as measured by the in vitro cAMP assay of Example 5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon receptor activity can be reduced, maintained, or enhanced by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 3, e.g. substitution of the naturally occurring glutamine at \nposition\n 3. In some embodiments, substitution of the amino acid at \nposition\n 3 with an acidic, basic, or hydrophobic amino acid (glutamic acid, ornithine, norleucine) has been shown to substantially reduce or destroy glucagon receptor activity. The analogs that are substituted with, for example, glutamic acid, ornithine, or norleucine have about 10% or less of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, e.g. about 1-10%, or about 0.1-10%, or greater than about 0.1% but less than about 10%, while exhibiting at least 20% of the activity of GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor. For example, exemplary analogs described herein have about 0.5%, about 1% or about 7% of the activity of native glucagon, while exhibiting at least 20% of the activity of GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor. In particular, any of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides, including glucagon analogs, glucagon agonist analogs, glucagon co-agonists, and glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist molecules, described herein may be modified to contain a modification at \nposition\n 3, e.g., Gln substituted with Glu, to produce a peptide with high selectivity, e.g., tenfold selectivity, for the GLP-1 receptor as compared to the selectivity for the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the naturally occurring glutamine at \nposition\n 3 of any of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon peptides can be substituted with a glutamine analog without a substantial loss of activity at the glucagon receptor, and in some cases, with an enhancement of glucagon receptor activity, as described herein. In specific embodiments, the amino acid at \nposition\n 3 is substituted with Dab(Ac). For example, glucagon agonists can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 595, SEQ ID NO: 601 SEQ ID NO: 603, SEQ ID NO: 604, SEQ ID NO: 605, and SEQ ID NO: 606.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was observed that modifications at position 2 (e.g. AIB at position 2) and in some cases modifications at \nposition\n 1 may reduce glucagon activity. This reduction in glucagon activity can be restored by stabilizing the alpha-helix in the C-terminal portion of glucagon, e.g. through means described herein, for example, through a covalent bond between the side chains of the amino acids at positions “i” and “i+4”, e.g., 12 and 16, 16 and 20, or 20 and 24. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is a lactam bridge between a glutamic acid at position 16 and a lysine at \nposition\n 20. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified sulfur-containing bridge formation, the use of α, ω-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications Affecting GLP-1 Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by replacing the carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester. In some embodiments, these \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides comprise a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20, wherein the carboxy terminal amino acid has an amide group in place of the carboxylic acid group found on the native amino acid. These \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides have strong activity at both the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors and thus act as co-agonists at both receptors. In accordance with some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide is a glucagon and GLP-1 receptor co-agonist, wherein the peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20, wherein the amino acid at position 28 is Asn or Lys and the amino acid at \nposition\n 29 is Thr-amide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by modifications that stabilize the alpha helix in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (e.g. around residues 12-29).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, such modifications permit formation of an intramolecular bridge between the side chains of two amino acids that are separated by three intervening amino acids (i.e., an amino acid at position “i” and an amino acid at position “i+4”, wherein i is any integer between 12 and 25), by two intervening amino acids, i.e., an amino acid at position “j” and an amino acid at position “j+3,” wherein j is any integer between 12 and 27, or by six intervening amino acids, i.e., an amino acid at position “k” and an amino acid at position “k+7,” wherein k is any integer between 12 and 22. In exemplary embodiments, the bridge or linker is about 8 (or about 7-9) atoms in length and forms between side chains of amino acids at positions 12 and 16, or at \npositions\n 16 and 20, or at \npositions\n 20 and 24, or at positions 24 and 28. The two amino acid side chains can be linked to one another through non-covalent bonds, e.g., hydrogen-bonding, ionic interactions, such as the formation of salt bridges, or by covalent bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide exhibits glucagon/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist activity and comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11, 47, 48 and 49. In some embodiments, the side chains are covalently bound to one another, and in some embodiments the two amino acids are bound to one another to form a lactam ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprises SEQ ID NO: 45, wherein at least one lactam ring is formed between the side chains of an amino acid pair selected from the group consisting of amino acid pairs 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24 or 24 and 28. In some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprises a glucagon peptide analog of SEQ ID NO: 20, wherein the peptide comprises an intramolecular lactam bridge formed between amino acid positions 12 and 16 or between amino acid positions 16 and 20. In some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20, wherein an intramolecular lactam bridge is formed between amino acid positions 12 and 16, between amino acid positions 16 and 20, or between amino acid positions 20 and 24 and the amino acid at \nposition\n 29 is glycine, wherein the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 29 is linked to the C-terminal amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 20. In a further embodiment, the amino acid at position 28 is aspartic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, stabilization of the alpha helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide is achieved through the formation of an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified sulfur-containing bridge formation, the use of α, ω-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization are used to stabilize the alpha helix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, enhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor may be achieved by stabilizing the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29) through purposeful introduction of one or more α,α-disubstituted amino acids at positions that retain the desired activity. Such peptides may be considered herein as a peptide lacking an intramolecular bridge. In some aspects, stabilization of the alpha-helix is accomplished in this manner without introduction of an intramolecular bridge such as a salt bridge or covalent bond. In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of \n \npositions\n \n 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 or 29 of a glucagon peptide is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid. For example, substitution of position 16 of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide with amino iso-butyric acid (AIB) enhances GLP-1 activity, in the absence of a salt bridge or lactam. In some embodiments, one, two, three or more of \npositions\n 16, 20, 21 or 24 are substituted with AIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor may be achieved by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 20. In some embodiments, the glutamine at \nposition\n 20 is replaced with another hydrophilic amino acid having a side chain that is either charged or has an ability to hydrogen-bond, and is at least about 5 (or about 4-6) atoms in length, for example, lysine, citrulline, arginine, or ornithine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 receptor is demonstrated in \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides comprising the C-terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 26. GLP-1 activity in \nsuch Class\n 3 glucagon related peptides comprising SEQ ID NO: 26 can be further increased by modifying the amino acid at \nposition\n 18, 28 or 29, or at \nposition\n 18 and 29, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further modest increase in GLP-1 potency may be achieved by modifying the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 to be Trp.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombinations of the modifications that increase GLP-1 receptor activity may provide higher GLP-1 activity than any of such modifications taken alone. For example, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides can comprise modifications at position 16, at \nposition\n 20, and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group, optionally with a covalent bond between the amino acids at \npositions\n 16 and 20; can comprise modifications at position 16 and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group; can comprise modifications at \npositions\n 16 and 20, optionally with a covalent bond between the amino acids at \npositions\n 16 and 20; or can comprise modifications at \nposition\n 20 and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group; optionally with the proviso that the amino acid at position 12 is not Arg; or optionally with the proviso that the amino acid at position 9 is not Glu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications Affecting Solubility\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition of Hydrophilic Moieties\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides can be further modified to improve the peptide's solubility and stability in aqueous solutions at physiological pH, while retaining the high biological activity relative to native glucagon. Hydrophilic moieties as discussed herein can be attached to the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide as further discussed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, introduction of hydrophilic groups at positions 17, 21, and 24 of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprising SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10 are anticipated to improve the solubility and stability of the high potency glucagon analog in solutions having a physiological pH. Introduction of such groups also increases duration of action, e.g. as measured by a prolonged half-life in circulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18 and SEQ ID NO: 19, wherein the side chain of an amino acid residue at one of position 16, 17, 21 or 24 of said \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide further comprises a polyethylene glycol chain, having a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 40,000 Daltons. In some embodiments, the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 5,000 Daltons. In another embodiment. the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight of about 10,000 to about 20,000 Daltons. In yet other exemplary embodiments the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight of about 20,000 to about 40,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable hydrophilic moieties include any water soluble polymers known in the art, including the hydrophilic moieties described herein, homo- or co-polymers of PEG, and a monomethyl-substituted polymer of PEG (mPEG). In accordance with some embodiments the hydrophilic group comprises a polyethylene (PEG) chain. More particularly, in some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 or SEQ ID NO: 7 wherein a PEG chain is covalently linked to the side chains of amino acids present at positions 21 and 24 of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide and the carboxy terminal amino acid of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide has the carboxylic acid group. In accordance with some embodiments, the polyethylene glycol chain has an average molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 10,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the \npegylated Class\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprises two or more polyethylene glycol chains covalently bound to the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide wherein the total molecular weight of the glucagon chains is about 1,000 to about 5,000 Daltons. In some embodiments the pegylated glucagon agonist comprises a peptide consisting of SEQ ID NO: 5 or a glucagon agonist analog of SEQ ID NO: 5, wherein a PEG chain is covalently linked to the amino acid residue at position 21 and at position 24, and wherein the combined molecular weight of the two PEG chains is about 1,000 to about 5,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCharged C-Terminus\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solubility of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprising SEQ ID NO: 20 can be further improved, for example, by introducing one, two, three or more charged amino acid(s) to the C-terminal portion of glucagon peptide of SEQ ID NO: 20, preferably at a position C-terminal to position 27. Such a charged amino acid can be introduced by substituting a native amino acid with a charged amino acid, e.g. at \npositions\n 28 or 29, or alternatively by adding a charged amino acid, e.g. after \n \nposition\n \n 27, 28 or 29. In exemplary embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. Additional modifications, e.g. conservative substitutions, may be made to the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide that still allow it to retain glucagon activity. In some embodiments, an analog of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide of SEQ ID NO: 20 is provided wherein the analog differs from SEQ ID NO: 20 by 1 to 2 amino acid substitutions at positions 17-26, and, in some embodiments, the analog differs from the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 20 by an amino acid substitution at \nposition\n 20.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcylation/Alkylation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl or alkyl group, e.g., a C4 to C30 acyl or alkyl group. In some aspects, the acyl group or alkyl group is not naturally occurring on an amino acid. In specific aspects, the acyl or alkyl group is non-native to any naturally-occurring amino acid. Acylation or alkylation can increase the half-life in circulation and/or delay the onset of and/or extend the duration of action and/or improve resistance to proteases such as DPP-IV. The activity at the glucagon receptor and GLP-1 receptor of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides is maintained, if not substantially enhanced after acylation Further, the potency of the acylated analogs were comparable to the unacylated versions of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides, if not substantially enhanced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the invention provides a \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide modified to comprise an acyl group or alkyl group covalently linked to the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide. The glucagon peptide may further comprise a spacer between the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide and the acyl group or alkyl group. Any of the foregoing \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides may comprise two acyl groups or two alkyl groups, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the \nacylated Class\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprises the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 534-544 and 546-549.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC-terminal Truncation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides described herein are further modified by truncation or deletion of one or two amino acids of the C-terminus of the glucagon peptide (i.e., \nposition\n 29 and/or 28) without affecting activity and/or potency at the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors. In this regard, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide can comprise amino acids 1-27 or 1-28 of the native glucagon peptide (SEQ ID NO: 1), optionally with one or more modifications described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the \ntruncated Class\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprises SEQ ID NO: 550 or SEQ ID NO: 551. In another embodiment, the truncated glucagon agonist peptide comprises SEQ ID NO: 552 or SEQ ID NO: 553.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC-terminal Extension\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides disclosed herein are modified by the addition of a second peptide to the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide, for example, SEQ ID NO: 26, SEQ ID NO: 27 or SEQ ID NO: 28. In some embodiments, a \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide having a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 66, SEQ ID NO: 67, SEQ ID NO: 68, and SEQ ID NO: 69 is covalently bound through a peptide bond to a second peptide, wherein the second peptide comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 26, SEQ ID NO: 27 and SEQ ID NO: 28. In a further embodiment, in \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides which comprise the C-terminal extension, the threonine at \nposition\n 29 of the native glucagon peptide is replaced with a glycine. A \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide having a glycine substitution for threonine at \nposition\n 29 and comprising the carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 26 is four times as potent at the GLP-1 receptor as native glucagon modified to comprise the carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 26. Potency at the GLP-1 receptor can be further enhanced by an alanine substitution for the native arginine at position 18.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide can have a carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 27 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 28. In accordance with some embodiments, \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprising SEQ ID NO: 33 or SEQ ID NO: 20, further comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 27 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 28 linked to \namino acid\n 29 of the glucagon peptide. More particularly, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13 SEQ ID NO: 14 and SEQ ID NO: 15, further comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 27 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 28 linked to \namino acid\n 29 of the glucagon peptide. More particularly, the glucagon peptide comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13 SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 66, SEQ ID NO: 67, SEQ ID NO: 68, SEQ ID NO: 69, SEQ ID NO: 55 and SEQ ID NO: 56 further comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26 (GPSSGAPPPS) or SEQ ID NO: 29 linked to \namino acid\n 29 of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide. In some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 64.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther Modifications\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the modifications described above with regard to \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides which increase or decrease glucagon receptor activity and which increase GLP-1 receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Combinations of the modifications that increase GLP-1 receptor activity generally provide higher GLP-1 activity than any of such modifications taken alone. Any of the modifications described above can also be combined with other modifications described herein in reference to \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides that confer other desirable properties, such as increased solubility and/or stability and/or duration of action. Alternatively, any of the modifications described above can be combined with other modifications described herein in reference to \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides that do not substantially affect solubility or stability or activity. Exemplary modifications include but are not limited to:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(A) Improving solubility, for example, by introducing one, two, three or more charged amino acid(s) to the C-terminal portion of native glucagon, preferably at a position C-terminal to position 27. Such a charged amino acid can be introduced by substituting a native amino acid with a charged amino acid, e.g. at \npositions\n 28 or 29, or alternatively by adding a charged amino acid, e.g. after \n \nposition\n \n 27, 28 or 29. In exemplary embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. In other embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are positively charged. Such modifications increase solubility, e.g. provide at least 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 25-fold, 30-fold or greater solubility relative to native glucagon at a given pH between about 5.5 and 8, e.g., pH 7, when measured after 24 hours at 25° C.\n \n(B) Increasing solubility and duration of action or half-life in circulation by addition of a hydrophilic moiety such as a polyethylene glycol chain, as described herein, e.g. at \n \nposition\n \n 16, 17, 20, 21, 24 or 29, or at the C-terminal amino acid of the peptide.\n \n(C) Increasing stability by modification of the aspartic acid at \nposition\n 15, for example, by deletion or substitution with glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, cysteic acid or homocysteic acid. Such modifications can reduce degradation or cleavage at a pH within the range of 5.5 to 8, especially in acidic or alkaline buffers, for example, retaining at least 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C.\n \n(D) Increasing stability by modification of the methionine at \nposition\n 27, for example, by substitution with leucine or norleucine. Such modifications can reduce oxidative degradation. Stability can also be increased by modification of the Gln at \nposition\n 20 or 24, e.g. by substitution with Ser, Thr, Ala or AIB. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through deamidation of Gln. Stability can be increased by modification of Asp at position 21, e.g. by substitution with Glu. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through dehydration of Asp to form a cyclic succinimide intermediate followed by isomerization to iso-aspartate.\n \n(E) Increasing resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) cleavage by modification of the amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 1 or 2 with the DPP-IV resistant amino acids described herein and including modification of the amino acid at \nposition\n 2 with N-methyl-alanine.\n \n(F) Conservative or non-conservative substitutions, additions or deletions that do not affect activity, for example, conservative substitutions at one or more of \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n 2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28 or 29; deletions at one or more of \n \npositions\n \n 27, 28 or 29; or a deletion of \namino acid\n 29 optionally combined with a C-terminal amide or ester in place of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group;\n \n(G) Adding C-terminal extensions as described herein;\n \n(H) Increasing half-life in circulation and/or extending the duration of action and/or delaying the onset of action, for example, through acylation or alkylation of the glucagon peptide, as described herein;\n \n(I) Homodimerization or heterodimerization as described herein.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nOther modifications include substitution of His at \nposition\n 1 with a large, aromatic amino acid (e.g., Tyr, Phe, Trp or amino-Phe); Ser at \nposition\n 2 with Ala; substitution of Tyr at \nposition\n 10 with Val or Phe; substitution of Lys at position 12 with Arg; substitution of Asp at \nposition\n 15 with Glu; substitution of Ser at position 16 with Thr or AIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides with GLP-1 activity that contain a non-conservative substitution of His at \nposition\n 1 with a large, aromatic amino acid (e.g., Tyr) can retain GLP-1 activity provided that the alpha-helix is stabilized via an intramolecular bridge, e.g., such as any of those described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates and Fusions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide can be linked, optionally via covalent bonding and optionally via a linker, to a conjugate moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide also can be part of a fusion peptide or protein wherein a second peptide or polypeptide has been fused to a terminus, e.g., the carboxy terminus of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, the \nfusion Class\n 3 glucagon related peptide may comprise a glucagon agonist of SEQ ID NO: 55, SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10 further comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26 (GPSSGAPPPS), SEQ ID NO: 27 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 28 (KRNR) linked to \namino acid\n 29 of the glucagon peptide. In some embodiments, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26 (GPSSGAPPPS), SEQ ID NO: 27 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 28 (KRNR) is bound to \namino acid\n 29 of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide through a peptide bond. Applicants have discovered that in \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide fusion peptides comprising the C-terminal extension peptide of Exendin-4 (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 26 or SEQ ID NO: 29), substitution of the native threonine residue at \nposition\n 29 with glycine dramatically increases GLP-1 receptor activity. This amino acid substitution can be used in conjunction with other modifications disclosed herein with regard to \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides to enhance the affinity of the glucagon analogs for the GLP-1 receptor. For example, the T29G substitution can be combined with the S16E and N20K amino acid substitutions, optionally with a lactam bridge between \namino acids\n 16 and 20, and optionally with addition of a PEG chain as described herein. In some embodiments, a \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 64. In some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide portion of the glucagon fusion peptide is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 55, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, and SEQ ID NO: 5 wherein a PEG chain, when present at positions 17, 21, 24, or the C-terminal amino acid, or at both 21 and 24, is selected from the range of 500 to 40,000 Daltons. More particularly, in some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide segment is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, and SEQ ID NO: 63, wherein the PEG chain is selected from the range of 500 to 5,000. In some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide is a fusion peptide comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 55 and SEQ ID NO: 65 wherein the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 65 is linked to the carboxy terminus of SEQ ID NO: 55.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, an additional chemical modification of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide of SEQ ID NO: 10 bestows increased GLP-1 receptor potency to a point where the relative activity at the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors is virtually equivalent. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprises a terminal amino acid comprising an amide group in place of the carboxylic acid group that is present on the native amino acid.

In some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptide comprises the amino acid sequences of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1801-1921.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nClass\n 4 Glucagon Related Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a glucagon related peptide is a \nClass\n 4 glucagon related peptide (see, e.g., International (PCT) Patent Application No. PCT/US2008/080973, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll biological sequences referenced in the following section (SEQ ID NOs: 1301-1371) correspond to SEQ ID NOs: 1-71 in International Patent Application No. PCT/US2008/080973.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, \nClass\n 4 glucagon related peptides are provided (hereafter referred to as “\nClass\n 4 peptides”). In certain aspects a \nClass\n 4 peptide is provided which has glucagon antagonist activity. A glucagon antagonists would be used in any setting where the suppression of glucagon agonism is desired. The most immediate and obvious use would be in the treatment of diabetes where glucagon antagonism has been demonstrated in pre-clinical models of hyperglycemia to yield a lowering of blood glucose. Glucagon antagonists can be further modified to improve the biophysical stability and/or aqueous solubility of the compounds while maintaining the antagonist activity of the parent compound. In certain aspects a \nClass\n 4 peptide is defined as a pure glucagon antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “glucagon antagonist” refers to a compound that counteracts glucagon activity or prevents glucagon function. For example, a glucagon antagonist exhibits at least 60% inhibition (e.g., at least 70% inhibition) and preferably, at least 80% inhibition, of the maximum response achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, the glucagon antagonist exhibits at least 90% inhibition of the maximum response achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In a specific embodiment, the glucagon antagonist exhibits 100% inhibition of the maximum response achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor. Additionally, a glucagon antagonist at a concentration of about 1 μM exhibits less than about 20% of the maximum agonist activity achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, the glucagon antagonist exhibits less than about 10% of the maximum agonist activity achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In a specific embodiment, the glucagon antagonist exhibits less than about 5% of the maximum agonist activity achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In yet another specific embodiment, the glucagon antagonist exhibits 0% of the maximum agonist activity achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “pure glucagon antagonist” is a glucagon antagonist that does not produce any detected stimulation of glucagon or GLP-1 receptor activity, as measured by cAMP production using a validated in vitro model assay (see, e.g., PCT/US2008/080973). For example, a pure glucagon antagonist exhibits less than about 5% (e.g., less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less than about 2%, less than about 1%, about 0%) of the maximum agonist activity achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor and exhibits less than about 5% (e.g., less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less than about 2%, less than about 1%, and about 0%) of the maximum agonist activity achieved by GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in some aspects, there is provided \nClass\n 4 peptides that exhibit pure glucagon antagonist activity. In accordance with some embodiments the glucagon antagonist exhibits activity that reduces glucagon receptor glucagon-induced cAMP production by a maximum of at least 50% when the glucagon receptor is contacted simultaneously with 0.8 nM of glucagon and the glucagon antagonist, as measured by cAMP production in an in vitro assay. In some embodiments, the glucagon antagonist reduces glucagon receptor glucagon-induced cAMP production by a maximum amount of at least 80%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nClass\n 4 peptides are believed to be suitable for any use that has previously been described for glucagon antagonists. Accordingly, the \nClass\n 4 peptides described herein can be used to treat hyperglycemia, or treat other metabolic diseases that result from high blood levels of glucagon or high blood glucose levels. In accordance with some embodiments the patient to be treated using the \nClass\n 4 peptides disclosed herein is a domesticated animal, and in another embodiment the patient to be treated is a human. Studies suggest that lack of glucagon suppression in diabetic patients contributes to postprandial hyperglycemia in part via accelerated glycogenolysis. Analysis of blood glucose during an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), and in the presence or absence of somatostatin-induced glucagon suppression, has shown a significant increase in glucose in subjects with higher glucagon levels. Accordingly, the \nClass\n 4 peptides of the present invention can be used to treat hyperglycemia, and are expected to be useful for treating a variety of types of diabetes including diabetes mellitus type I, diabetes mellitus type II, or gestational diabetes, either insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent, and reducing complications of diabetes including nephropathy, retinopathy and vascular disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the terminal ten amino acids of Exendin-4 (i.e. the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1319 (GPSSGAPPPS)) are linked to the carboxy terminus of a \nClass\n 4 peptide. These fusion proteins are anticipated to have pharmacological activity for suppressing appetite and inducing weight loss/weight maintenance. In accordance with some embodiments the \nClass\n 4 peptides disclosed herein can be further modified to include the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1319 (GPSSGAPPPS) linked to amino acid 24 of the \nClass\n 4 peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1342 and administered to individuals to induce weight loss or assist in weight maintenance. More particularly, the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1302, SEQ ID NO: 1303, SEQ ID NO: 1304 SEQ ID NO: 1305, SEQ ID NO: 1306, SEQ ID NO: 1307, SEQ ID NO: 1308, SEQ ID NO: 1336, SEQ ID NO: 1339, SEQ ID NO: 1340 SEQ ID NO: 1341, SEQ ID NO: 1342, SEQ ID NO: 1343 and SEQ ID NO: 1344 and further comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1319 (GPSSGAPPPS) linked to amino acid 24 of the \nClass\n 4 peptide is used to suppress appetite and inducing weight loss/weight maintenance. In some embodiments the administered \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1346 or SEQ ID NO: 1347.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch methods for reducing appetite or promoting loss of body weight are expected to be useful in reducing body weight, preventing weight gain, or treating obesity of various causes, including drug-induced obesity, and reducing complications associated with obesity including vascular disease (coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, ischemia reperfusion, etc.), hypertension, onset of diabetes type II, hyperlipidemia and musculoskeletal diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nClass\n 4 peptides of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic or anti-obesity agents. Anti-diabetic agents known in the art or under investigation include insulin, sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide (Orinase), acetohexamide (Dymelor), tolazamide (Tolinase), chlorpropamide (Diabinese), glipizide (Glucotrol), glyburide (Diabeta, Micronase, Glynase), glimepiride (Amaryl), or gliclazide (Diamicron); meglitinides, such as repaglinide (Prandin) or nateglinide (Starlix); biguanides such as metformin (Glucophage) or phenformin; thiazolidinediones such as rosiglitazone (Avandia), pioglitazone (Actos), or troglitazone (Rezulin), or other PPARγ inhibitors; alpha glucosidase inhibitors that inhibit carbohydrate digestion, such as miglitol (Glyset), acarbose (Precose/Glucobay); exenatide (Byetta) or pramlintide; Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors such as vildagliptin or sitagliptin; SGLT (sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1) inhibitors; or FBPase (\nfructose\n 1,6-bisphosphatase) inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-obesity agents known in the art or under investigation include appetite suppressants, including phenethylamine type stimulants, phentermine (optionally with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine), diethylpropion (Tenuate®), phendimetrazine (Prelu-2®, Bontril®), benzphetamine (Didrex®), sibutramine (Meridia®, Reductil®); rimonabant (Acomplia®), other cannabinoid receptor antagonists; oxyntomodulin; fluoxetine hydrochloride (Prozac); Qnexa (topiramate and phentermine), Excalia (bupropion and zonisamide) or Contrave (bupropion and naltrexone); or lipase inhibitors, similar to xenical (Orlistat) or Cetilistat (also known as ATL-962), or GT 389-255.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nClass\n 4 peptides of the present invention can also be administered to patients suffering from catabolic wasting. It is estimated that over half of cancer patients experience catabolic wasting which is characterized by unintended and progressive weight loss, weakness, and low body fat and muscle. The syndrome is equally common in AIDS patients and can also be present in bacterial and parasitic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic diseases of the bowel, liver, lungs, and heart. It is usually associated with anorexia and can manifest as a condition in aging or as a result of physical trauma. Catabolic wasting is a symptom that diminishes the quality of life, worsens the underlying condition, and is a major cause of death. Applicants anticipate that the \nClass\n 4 peptides disclosed herein can be administered to patients to treat catabolic wasting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions comprising the \nClass\n 4 peptides disclosed herein can be formulated and administered to patients to using standard pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and routes of administration known to those skilled in the art. Accordingly the present disclosure also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more of the \nClass\n 4 peptides disclosed herein in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise the \nClass\n 4 peptides as the sole pharmaceutically active component, or the \nClass\n 4 peptides can be combined with one or more additional active agents. In accordance with some embodiments a composition is provided comprising a \nClass\n 4 peptide of the present invention and a compound that activates the GLP-1 receptor (such as GLP-1, a GLP-1 analog, an exendin-4 analog, or derivatives thereof). In accordance with some embodiments a composition is provided comprising a \nClass\n 4 peptide of the present invention and insulin or an insulin analog. Alternatively, a composition provided for inducing weight loss or preventing weight gain can be provided that comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1342 further comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1319 (GPSSGAPPPS) linked to amino acid 24 of SEQ ID NO: 1342, and an anti-obesity peptide. Suitable anti-obesity peptides include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,691,309, 6,436,435 or US Patent application 20050176643, and including, but not limited to GLP-1, GIP (Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide), MP1, PYY, MC-4, Leptin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nClass\n 4 Peptide Structure\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some \nembodiments Class\n 4 glucagon related peptides are provided wherein the normally occurring aspartic acid at position nine (of glucagon, SEQ ID NO: 1301) has been substituted with glutamic acid or a cysteic acid-based derivative. More particularly, deletion of the first amino acid (des-His) and substitution of the aspartic acid at position 9 with glutamic acid, in some aspects, produces a \nClass\n 4 peptide. \nClass\n 4 glucagon related peptides having sulfonic acid substituents substituted at amino acid position nine of glucagon perform similarly to the carboxylic acid-based amino acids but with a few critical differences in relation to physical properties such as solubility. Homocysteic acid (hCysSO\n3\n) when substituted for the isosteric glutamic acid at position nine in the conventional des-His, Glu9 \nClass\n 4 peptide retains a partial antagonist and weak agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments there is provided a \nClass\n 4 peptide wherein the first two to five amino acids are removed, and position 9 (according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 1301) is replaced with hCys(SO\n3\n), homoglutamic acid, β-homoglutamic acid, or an alkylcarboxylate derivative of cysteine having the structure of:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein X\n5 \nis C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkenyl, or C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkynyl, provides a compound that performs as a hormonal antagonist that is highly specific, potent and without contaminating agonist properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments a \nClass\n 4 peptide is provided that comprises a glucagon peptide modified, relative to the wild type sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1301, by the deletion of two to five amino acid residues from the N-terminus and substitution of the aspartic acid residue at position nine of the native protein with a glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, β-homoglutamic acid, a sulfonic acid derivative of cysteine, or an alkylcarboxylate derivative of cysteine having the structure of:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein X\n5 \nis C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkenyl, or C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkynyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific embodiment, the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprising the deletion of two to five amino acid residues from the N-terminus and substitution of the Asp at position 9 of the native glucagon, is further modified by up to three amino acid modifications. For example, the \nClass\n 4 peptide may comprise one, two, or three conservative amino acid modifications. Alternatively or additionally, the \nClass\n 4 peptide may comprise one or more amino acid modifications selected from the group consisting of:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nA. substitution of one or two amino acids at \n \npositions\n \n 10, 20, and 24, (according to the amino acid numbering of SEQ ID NO: 1301), or the N- or C-terminal amino acid of the \nClass\n 4 peptide with an amino acid covalently attached to an acyl group or alkyl group via an ester, ether, thioether, amide, or alkyl amine linkage;\n \nB. substitution of one or two amino acids at \npositions\n 16, 17, 20, 21, and 24 (according to the amino acid numbering of SEQ ID NO: 1301), or the N- or C-terminal amino acid of the \nClass\n 4 peptide with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of: Cys, Lys, ornithine, homocysteine, and acetyl-phenylalanine (Ac-Phe), wherein the amino acid of the group is covalently bonded to a hydrophilic moiety;\n \nC. addition of an amino acid covalently bonded to a hydrophilic moiety to the N- or C-terminus of the \nClass\n 4 peptide;\n \nD. substitution of Asp at position 15 (according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 1301) with cysteic acid, glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, and homocysteic acid;\n \nE. substitution of Ser at position 16 (according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 1301) with cysteic acid, glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, and homocysteic acid;\n \nF. substitution with AIB at one or more of \npositions\n 16, 20, 21, and 24 according to the amino acid numbering of SEQ ID NO: 1301;\n \nG. deletion of the amino acid at \nposition\n 29 or the amino acids at \npositions\n 28 and 29, according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 1301;\n \nH. substitution of each or both of the Asn at position 28 and the Thr at position 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of SEQ ID NO: 1301) with charged amino acids; and/or addition of one to two charged amino acids at the C-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 1301;\n \nI. substitution of the Met at position 27 (according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 1301) with Leu or norleucine;\n \nJ. addition of a peptide having the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 19-21 and 53 to the C-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 1301; wherein Thr at position 29 (according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 1301) is Thr or Gly; and\n \nK. replacement of the C-terminal carboxylate with an amide or ester.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises an amino acid modification of A, B, or C, as described above, or a combination thereof. In yet another specific embodiment, the \nClass\n 4 peptide further comprises an amino acid modification of any of D to K as described above, or a combination thereof, in addition to the amino acid modification(s) of A, B, and/or C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises a glucagon peptide, wherein the first 5 amino acids have been removed from the N-terminus, and the remaining N-terminal amino group has been replaced with a hydroxyl group (the “PLA6 analog”), producing the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1339. Applicants have found that substitution of phenyl-lactic acid for phenylalanine in \nClass\n 4 peptide analogs that have the first five amino acids deleted and substitution of a glutamic acid at position 9 (relative to native glucagon) further enhances the potency of those \nClass\n 4 peptide analogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the \nClass\n 4 peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1339 is further modified by substituting the aspartic acid residue at position four (position 9 of the native glucagon) with an amino acid of the general structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein X\n6 \nis C\n1\n-C\n3 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n3 \nalkene or C\n2\n-C\n3 \nalkynyl, and in some embodiments X\n6 \nis C\n1\n-C\n3 \nalkyl, and in another embodiment X\n6 \nis C\n2 \nalkyl. In some embodiments the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises a glucagon peptide, wherein the first 5 amino acids have been removed from the N-terminus, and the aspartic acid residue at position four (position 9 of the native glucagon) has been substituted with cysteic acid or homocysteic acid. In some embodiments the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises a glucagon peptide comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1339, SEQ ID NO: 1307 and SEQ ID NO: 1308. In some embodiments the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1308, wherein the amino acid at position four is homocysteic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the \nClass\n 4 peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1339 is further modified by substituting the aspartic acid residue at position four (position 9 of the native glucagon) with glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, β-homoglutamic acid, or an alkylcarboxylate derivative of cysteine having the structure of:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein X\n5 \nis C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkenyl, or C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkynyl. In a specific embodiment, X\n5 \nis C\n1 \nor C\n2 \nalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, applicants have discovered that with the substitution of the N-terminal phenylalanine with PLA in a des1-5 glucagon analog (i.e., a glucagon analog having the first five amino acids deleted), further substitution of the native aspartic acid residue at position four (position 9 of the native glucagon) is not required to produce an analog that exhibits pure antagonism. This result is surprising in light of the prior art teachings that the native aspartic acid residue at position four must substituted to produce high affinity and potent antagonists of glucagon (2-29) analogs. The use of the PLA substitution improves the relative potency of the Asp9 analog to a point comparable to that of the Glu9 and hCys(SO\n3\nH)9 analogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitution of the phenylalanine residue with other phenylalanine analogs, including 3, 4-2F-phenylalnine (3, 4-2F-Phe), 2-naphthyalanine (2-NaI), N-acyl-phenylalanine (Ac-Phe), alpha-methylhydrocinnamic acid (MCA) and benzylmalonic acid (BMA) did not perform as potently as the PLA substitution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstituting PLA at sites other than at position six (according to the amino acid numbering of native glucagon), including at \n \npositions\n \n 4 and 5 reveals that the PLA6 analog is an appreciably more potent antagonist than glucagon analogs having a slightly extended N-terminus. The present invention also includes analogs wherein the N-terminal amino group is substituted with an acylated and alkylated “O-terminal” peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the PLA6 substitution not only increases the potency of the antagonist but also serves a critical role in pegylation. The PLA6 analogs can be selectively pegylated without restoration of glucagon agonism. In the absence of the PLA substitution, pegylation of the analog surprisingly induces glucagon agonism. This glucagon agonism is not seen in the pegylated PLA6 analogs. Several sites for pegylation were investigated including \n \npositions\n \n 3, 6 and 19 (\npositions\n 8, 11 and 19 of native glucagon) and at the N-terminal amino acid residue. In some embodiments the pegylation is at position 19 (position 24 of native glucagon) as that site exhibits the most potent and selective glucagon antagonism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises the general structure of A-B-C, wherein A is selected from the group consisting of:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(i) phenyl lactic acid (PLA);\n \n(ii) an oxy derivative of PLA;\n \n(iii) a peptide of 2 to 6 amino acids in which two consecutive amino acids of the peptide are linked via an ester or ether bond;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nB represents amino acids i to 26 of SEQ ID NO: 1301, wherein i is 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, optionally comprising one or more amino acid modifications selected from the group consisting of:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(iv) Asp at position 9 (according to the amino acid numbering of SEQ ID NO: 1301) is substituted with a Glu, a sulfonic acid derivative of Cys, homoglutamic acid, β-homoglutamic acid, or an alkylcarboxylate derivative of cysteine having the structure of:\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein X\n5 \nis C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkenyl, or C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkynyl.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(v) substitution of one or two amino acids at \n \npositions\n \n 10, 20, and 24, (according to the amino acid numbering of SEQ ID NO: 1301) with an amino acid covalently attached to an acyl or alkyl group via an ester, ether, thioether, amide, or alkyl amine linkage;\n \n(vi) substitution of one or two amino acids at \npositions\n 16, 17, 20, 21, and 24 (according to the amino acid numbering of SEQ ID NO: 1301) with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of: Cys, Lys, ornithine, homocysteine, and acetyl-phenylalanine (Ac-Phe), wherein the amino acid of the group is covalently attached to a hydrophilic moiety;\n \n(vii) Asp at position 15 (according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 1301) is substituted with cysteic acid, glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, and homocysteic acid;\n \n(viii) Ser at position 16 (according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 1301) is substituted with cysteic acid, glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, and homocysteic acid;\n \n(ix) substitution with AIB at one or more of \npositions\n 16, 20, 21, and 24 according to the amino acid numbering of SEQ ID NO: 1301;\n\n\nand C is selected from the group consisting of:\n\n \n(x) X;\n \n(xi) X—Y;\n \n(xii) X—Y—Z; and\n \n(xiii) X—Y—Z—R10,\n\n\nwherein X is Met, Leu, or Nle; Y is Asn or a charged amino acid; Z is Thr, Gly, Cys, Lys, ornithine (Orn), homocysteine, acetyl phenylalanine (Ac-Phe), or a charged amino acid; wherein R10 is selected from a group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1319-1321 and 1353; and\n\n \n(xiv) any of (x) to (xiii) in which the C-terminal carboxylate is replaced with an amide.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect, the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises an oxy derivative of PLA. As used herein “oxy derivative of PLA” refers to a compound comprising a modified structure of PLA in which the hydroxyl group has been replaced with O—R\n11\n, wherein R\n11 \nis a chemical moiety. In this regard, the oxy derivative of PLA can be, for example, an ester of PLA or an ether of PLA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of making oxy derivatives of PLA are known in the art. For example, when the oxy derivative is an ester of PLA, the ester may be formed by upon reaction of the hydroxyl of PLA with a carbonyl bearing a nucleophile. The nucleophile can be any suitable nucleophile, including, but not limited to an amine or hydroxyl. Accordingly, the ester of PLA can comprise the structure of Formula IV:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein R7 is an ester formed upon reaction of the hydroxyl of PLA with a carbonyl bearing a nucleophile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe carbonyl bearing a nucleophile (which reacts with the hydroxyl of PLA to form an ester) can be, for example, a carboxylic acid, a carboxylic acid derivative, or an activated ester of a carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid derivative can be, but is not limited to, an acyl chloride, an acid anhydride, an amide, an ester, or a nitrile. The activated ester of a carboxylic acid can be, for example, N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), tosylate (Tos), a carbodiimide, or a hexafluorophosphate. In some embodiments, the carbodiimide is 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), or 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DICD). In some embodiments, the hexafluorophosphate is selected from a group consisting of hexafluorophosphate benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), 2-(1H-7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU), and o-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-uronium-hexafluoro-phosphate (HBTU).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of making ethers from reaction with a hydroxyl group (e.g., the hydroxyl of PLA) also are known in the art. For example, the hydroxyl group of PLA may be reacted with a halogenated alkyl or tosylated alkyl alcohol to form an ether bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the chemical moiety of R\n11 \nis one which does not decrease the activity of the \nClass\n 4 peptide. In some embodiments, the chemical moiety enhances the activity, stability, and/or solubility of the \nClass\n 4 peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the chemical moiety bound to PLA via an oxygen-containing bond (e.g., via an ester or ether bond) is a polymer (e.g., a polyalkylene glycol), a carbohydrate, an amino acid, a peptide, or a lipid, e.g., a fatty acid or a steroid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the chemical moiety is an amino acid, which, optionally, is a part of a peptide, such that Formula IV is a depsipeptide.

In this regard, the \nClass\n 4 peptide described herein can, for example, consist essentially of or consist of amino acids 1-27, 1-28, 2-27, 2-28, 3-27, 3-28, 4-27, 4-28, 5-27, 5-28, 6-27, or 6-28 of the native glucagon peptide (SEQ ID NO: 1301) with one or more modifications resulting in \nClass\n 4 peptideic activity as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe presently disclosed \nClass\n 4 peptides also encompass amino acid substitutions at positions that are known not to be critical to the function of the glucagon peptide.

In some embodiments the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises a glucagon peptide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1309, SEQ ID NO: 1310, SEQ ID NO: 1311 and SEQ ID NO: 1312, wherein the Fc peptide is bound to the side chain of the amino acid located at position 11, 16 or 19 of SEQ ID NO: 1309, SEQ ID NO: 1310, SEQ ID NO: 1311, respectively, and at both positions 11 and 19 for SEQ ID NO: 1312.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention, the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1362, 1364-1367, and 1371.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications to Improve Solubility\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nClass\n 4 peptides can be further modified to improve the peptide's solubility in aqueous solutions at physiological pH, while, in some aspects retaining a glucagon antagonist activity. Introduction of hydrophilic groups at positions corresponding to \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 1, 16, 17, 20, 21, 24 and 29 of the native peptide, or at the C-terminus, can improve the solubility of the resulting \nClass\n 4 peptide in solutions having a physiological pH, while retaining the parent compounds antagonist activity. Therefore, in some embodiments the presently disclosed \nClass\n 4 peptides are further modified to comprise one or more hydrophilic groups covalently linked to the side chains of amino acids corresponding to \n \n \namino acid positions\n \n \n 1, 16, 17, 20, 21, 24 and 29 of the native glucagon peptide or of the N- or C-terminal amino acid. In a further embodiment the side chains of amino acids corresponding to amino acid positions 16 and 24 of the native glucagon peptide are covalently bound to hydrophilic groups, and in some embodiments the hydrophilic group is polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApplicants have also discovered that native glucagon can be modified by introducing charge at its carboxy terminus to enhance the solubility of the peptide while retaining the agonist properties of the peptide. The enhanced solubility allows for the preparation and storage of glucagon solutions at near neutral pH. Formulating glucagon solutions at relatively neutral pHs (e.g. pH of about 6.0 to about 8.0) improves the long term stability of the \nClass\n 4 peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgain, applicants anticipate that the \nClass\n 4 peptides disclosed herein can be similarly modified to enhance their solubility in aqueous solutions at relatively neutral pH (e.g. pH of about 6.0 to about 8.0) while retaining the antagonist properties of the parent protein. Accordingly, some embodiments of the present invention is directed to a \nClass\n 4 peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1339 that has been further modified relative to the native amino acids present at positions 6-29 of the wild type glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1301) to add charge to the peptide by the substitution of native non-charged amino acids with charged amino acids, or the addition of charged amino acids to the carboxy terminus. In accordance with some embodiments, one to three of the non-charged native amino acids of the \nClass\n 4 peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1339 are replaced with a charged amino acid. In some embodiments the charged amino acid is selected from the group consisting of lysine, arginine, histidine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid. More particularly, applicants have discovered that substituting the normally occurring amino acid at corresponding position 28 and/or 29 relative to native glucagon with charged amino acids, and/or the addition of one to two charged amino acids at the carboxy terminus of the \nClass\n 4 peptide, enhances the solubility and stability of the \nClass\n 4 peptides in aqueous solutions at physiologically relevant pHs (i.e., a pH of about 6.5 to about 7.5). Accordingly, such modifications of the \nClass\n 4 peptide disclosed herein are anticipated to have a similar effect on the solubility in aqueous solutions, particularly at a pH ranging from about 5.5 to about 8.0, while retaining the parent peptide's biological activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments the \nClass\n 4 peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1339 is modified by the substitution of the native amino acid at corresponding position 28 and/or 29 relative to native glucagon with a negatively charged amino acid (e.g., aspartic acid or glutamic acid) and optionally the addition of a negatively charged amino acid (e.g., aspartic acid or glutamic acid) to the carboxy terminus of the peptide. In an alternative embodiment the \nClass\n 4 peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1339 is modified by the substitution of the native amino acid at \ncorresponding position\n 29 relative to native glucagon with a positively charged amino acid (e.g., lysine, arginine or histidine) and optionally the addition of one or two positively charged amino acid (e.g., lysine, arginine or histidine) on the carboxy terminus of the peptide. In accordance with some embodiments a \nClass\n 4 peptide having improved solubility and stability is provided wherein the peptide comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1341 with the proviso that at least one amino acids at position, 23, or 24 of SEQ ID NO: 1341 is substituted with an acidic amino acid, and/or an additional acidic amino acid is added at the carboxy terminus of SEQ ID NO: 1341. In some embodiments the acidic amino acids are independently selected from the group consisting of Asp, Glu, cysteic acid and homocysteic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments a \nClass\n 4 peptide having improved solubility and stability is provided wherein the antagonist comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1341, SEQ ID NO: 1342, SEQ ID NO: 1343 or SEQ ID NO: 1344, wherein at least one of the amino acids at positions 23 or 24 is substituted with a non-native amino acid residue (i.e. at least one amino acid present at position 23 or 24 of the analog is an acidic amino acid different from the amino acid present at the corresponding position in SEQ ID NO: 1307). In accordance with some embodiments a glucagon agonist is provided comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1341 or 1342 with the proviso that when the amino acid at position 23 is asparagine and the amino acid at position 24 is threonine, the peptide further comprises one to two amino acids, independently selected from the group consisting of Lys, Arg, His, Asp or Glu, added to the carboxy terminus of the \nClass\n 4 peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the solubility of the \nClass\n 4 peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1342 can be improved by covalently linking a hydrophilic moiety to an amino acid residue at \nposition\n 11, 12, 15, 16, 19 or 24, and in some embodiments the hydrophilic moiety is linked to an amino acid at position 11, 16 or 19, and in a further embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is linked to amino acid 19. In some embodiments the hydrophilic moiety is a plasma protein or the Fc portion of an immunoglobin, and in an alternative embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is a hydrophilic hydrocarbon chain. In some embodiments the hydrophilic moiety is polyethylene glycol, having a molecular weight selected from the range of about 1,000 to about 5,000 Daltons. In another embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is polyethylene glycol, having a molecular weight of at least about 20,000 Daltons. In some embodiments the polyethylene modified \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises the amino acids sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1309, SEQ ID NO: 1310, SEQ ID NO: 1311, SEQ ID NO: 1312, SEQ ID NO: 1343, SEQ ID NO: 1344 or SEQ ID NO: 1345.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications to Improve Stability\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Asp-Ser sequence at position 15-16 of native glucagon has been identified as a uniquely unstable dipeptide that leads to premature chemical cleavage of the native hormone in aqueous buffers. For example, when maintained at 0.01N HCl at 37° C. for 2 weeks, more than 50% of the native glucagon may be cleaved into fragments. The two liberated cleavage peptides 1-15 and 16-29 are devoid of glucagon-like biological activity and thus represent a limitation on the aqueous pre-formulation of glucagon and its related analogs. The selective chemical substitution of the Asp at \nposition\n 15 of the native glucagon peptide with Glu has been observed to virtually eliminate chemical cleavage of the 15-16 peptide bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, it is expected that the \nClass\n 4 peptides of the present invention can be similarly modified to decrease their susceptibility to premature chemical cleavage in aqueous buffers. In accordance with some embodiments the \nClass\n 4 peptides described herein can be further modified to enhance their stability in aqueous solutions by replacing the native aspartic amino acid, located at \nposition\n 15 of the native glucagon peptide, with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of cysteic acid, glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid and homocysteic acid. In accordance with some embodiments the aspartic acid residue at \nposition\n 10 of the \nClass\n 4 peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1339 can be substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of cysteic acid, glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid and homocysteic acid, and in some embodiments the native aspartic acid at \nposition\n 10 of SEQ ID NO: 1339 is replaced with glutamic acid. In accordance with some embodiments a \nClass\n 4 peptide having improved stability in aqueous solutions is provided wherein the antagonist comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1336, SEQ ID NO: 1340 and SEQ ID NO: 1342. In a further embodiment the \nClass\n 4 peptide is amidated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, increased stability by way of reduced degradation of the \nClass\n 4 peptide described herein may also be achieved by substitution of the serine at position 16 (according to the numbering of native glucagon) with glutamic acid, cysteic acid, homo-glutamic acid, or homo-cysteic acid. In a specific embodiment, the serine at position 16 (according to the native glucagon sequence numbering) is replaced with glutamic acid. In a more specific aspect, the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprising such a modification comprises a C-terminal carboxylate and is not amidated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, a \nClass\n 4 peptide is provided comprising a glucagon peptide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1307, SEQ ID NO: 1336, SEQ ID NO: 1339, SEQ ID NO: 1340, SEQ ID NO: 1341, SEQ ID NO: 1342, SEQ ID NO: 1343 and SEQ ID NO: 1344, further modified by one or more additional amino acid substitutions at positions corresponding to \npositions\n 11, 12, 15, 16, 19 and/or 24 of the native glucagon peptide, wherein the amino acid substitutions comprise a substitution with an amino acid having a side chain suitable for crosslinking with hydrophilic moieties, including for example, PEG. The peptide can be substituted with a naturally occurring amino acid or a synthetic (non-naturally occurring) amino acid. Synthetic or non-naturally occurring amino acids refer to amino acids that do not naturally occur in vivo but which, nevertheless, can be incorporated into the peptide structures described herein. In some embodiments a \nClass\n 4 peptide is provided wherein the peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1307, SEQ ID NO: 1336, SEQ ID NO: 1339, SEQ ID NO: 1340, SEQ ID NO: 1341, SEQ ID NO: 1342, SEQ ID NO: 1343 and SEQ ID NO: 1344, and further comprises a polyethylene glycol chain bound to corresponding position 21 or 24 of the native glucagon peptide. In a further embodiment the C-terminus of the \nClass\n 4 peptide is modified to replace the carboxylic acid group with an amide group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusion Peptides and Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also encompasses \nClass\n 4 peptide fusion peptides wherein a second peptide has been fused to the C-terminus of the \nClass\n 4 peptide.

In some embodiments the composition comprising insulin and the composition comprising the \nClass\n 4 peptide are administered within 12 hours of one another. The exact ratio of the \nClass\n 4 peptide relative to the administered insulin will be dependent in part on determining the glucagon levels of the patient, and can be determined through routine experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDimer Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also encompasses multimers of the modified \nClass\n 4 peptides disclosed herein. Two or more of the modified \nClass\n 4 peptides can be linked together using standard linking agents and procedures known to those skilled in the art. For example, dimers can be formed between two modified \nClass\n 4 peptides through the use of bifunctional thiol crosslinkers and bi-functional amine crosslinkers, particularly for \nClass\n 4 peptides that have been substituted (at positions 11, 16 or 19, for example) with cysteine, lysine ornithine, homocysteine or acetyl phenylalanine residues (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 1309, SEQ ID NO: 1310, SEQ ID NO: 1311 and SEQ ID NO: 1312).

Glucagon antagonists/GLP-1 agonists are utilized in any setting where the suppression of glucagon agonism is desired while simultaneous stimulation of GLP-1 activity is also desired. For example, glucagon antagonist activity in conjunction with GLP-1 stimulation can be used in the treatment of diabetes where glucagon antagonism has been demonstrated in pre-clinical models of hyperglycemia to yield a lowering of blood glucose and GLP-1 activity is associated with insulin production. Compounds demonstrating GLP-1 activity have also been known to be useful for treating obesity and preventing weight gain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \ncertain aspects class\n 5 peptides are believed to be suitable for any use that has previously been described for other glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists. These two activities have separately been shown to be highly desirable properties for the treatment of the metabolic syndrome, specifically diabetes and obesity. The glucagon antagonist activity is useful in any setting where the suppression of glucagon agonism is desired. The presence of GLP-1 agonism further suppresses the endogenous secretion of glucagon from the pancreas while stimulating insulin synthesis and secretion. The two pharmacological actions serve in a synergistic fashion to normalize metabolic abnormalities. Accordingly, the \nClass\n 5 peptides can be used to treat hyperglycemia, or treat other metabolic diseases that result from high blood levels of glucagon or high blood glucose levels. In accordance with some embodiments the patient to be treated using the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists such as \nclass\n 5 peptides disclosed herein is a domesticated animal, and in another embodiment the patient to be treated is a human. Studies suggest that lack of glucagon suppression in diabetic patients contributes to postprandial hyperglycemia in part via accelerated glycogenolysis. Analysis of blood glucose during an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), and in the presence or absence of somatostatin-induced glucagon suppression has shown a significant increase in glucose in subjects with higher glucagon levels. Accordingly, a glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists or \nClass\n 5 peptides described herein can be used to treating hyperglycemia, and are expected to be useful for treating a variety of types of diabetes including diabetes mellitus type I, diabetes mellitus type II, or gestational diabetes, either insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent, and reducing complications of diabetes including nephropathy, retinopathy and vascular disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch methods for reducing appetite or promoting loss of body weight are expected to be useful in reducing body weight, preventing weight gain, or treating obesity of various causes, including drug-induced obesity, and reducing complications associated with obesity including vascular disease (coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, ischemia reperfusion, etc.), hypertension, onset of diabetes type II, hyperlipidemia and musculoskeletal diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical \ncompositions comprising class\n 5 peptides can be formulated and administered to patients using standard pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and routes of administration known to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the present disclosure also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or \nmore class\n 5 peptides disclosed herein in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise the \nclass\n 5 peptides as the sole pharmaceutically active component, or the \nclass\n 5 peptides can be combined with one or more additional active agents. In accordance with some embodiments a composition is provided comprising a \nClass\n 5 peptide and insulin or an insulin analog. Alternatively, a composition is provided for inducing weight loss or preventing weight gain can be provided that comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1415 or SEQ ID NO: 1451 further comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1421 (GPSSGAPPPS) or SEQ ID NO: 1450 linked to amino acid 24 of SEQ ID NO: 1415 or SEQ ID NO: 1451, and an anti-obesity peptide. Suitable anti-obesity peptides include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,691,309, 6,436,435 or US Patent application 20050176643.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nClass\n 5 Peptide Structure\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments a \nClass\n 5 peptide is provided comprising a glucagon peptide that has been modified by the deletion of the first 1 to 5 amino acids residues (e.g., first amino acid, first two amino acids, first three amino acids, first four amino acids, first five amino acids) from the N-terminus, and stabilization of the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the compound (around amino acid positions 12-29 according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon, SEQ ID NO: 1401), e.g., by the linkage of the side chains of amino acid pairs, selected from \n \npositions\n \n 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24, and 24 and 28 (relative to the native glucagon peptide sequence), to one another through hydrogen-bonding or ionic interactions, such as the formation of salt bridges, or by covalent bonds. Alternatively, stabilization of the alpha-helix around residues 12-29 is achieved through introduction of one or more α,α-disubstituted amino acids at positions that retain the desired activity. In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of \npositions\n 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 or 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) of the \nClass\n 5 peptide or analog thereof is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid.

In some embodiments, the hexafluorophosphate is selected from a group consisting of hexafluorophosphate benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), 2-(1H-7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU), and o-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-uronium-hexafluoro-phosphate (HBTU).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of making ethers from reaction with a hydroxyl group (e.g., the hydroxyl of PLA) also are known in the art. For example, the hydroxyl group of PLA may be reacted with a halogenated alkyl or tosylated alkyl alcohol to form an ether bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the chemical moiety bound to PLA via an oxygen-containing bond (e.g., via an ester or ether bond) is a polymer (e.g., a polyalkylene glycol), a carbohydrate, an amino acid, a peptide, or a lipid, e.g., a fatty acid or a steroid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the chemical moiety is an amino acid, which, optionally, is a part of a peptide, such that Formula IV is a depsipeptide. In this regard, PLA may be at a position other than the N-terminal amino acid residue of the peptide, such that the peptide comprises one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or more) amino acids N-terminal to the PLA residue. For example, the peptide can comprise PLA at position n, wherein n is 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 of the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acids N-terminal to the PLA residue may be synthetic or naturally-occurring. In a specific embodiment, the amino acids which are N-terminal PLA are naturally-occurring amino acids. In some embodiments, the amino acids which are N-terminal to PLA are the N-terminal amino acids of native glucagon. For example, the peptide can comprise at the N-terminus the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1452-1456, wherein PLA is linked to threonine via an ester bond:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-PLA\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 1452\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer-Gln-Gly-Thr-PLA\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 1453\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln-Gly-Thr-PLA\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 1454\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly-Thr-PLA\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 1455\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr-PLA\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 1456\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative embodiment, one or more of the N-terminal amino acids may be substituted with an amino acid other than the amino acid of native glucagon. For example, when the peptide comprises PLA as the amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 5 or 6, the amino acid at \nposition\n 1 and/or \nposition\n 2 may be an amino acid which reduces susceptibility to cleavage by dipeptidyl peptidase IV.

More particularly, the \nClass\n 5 peptide comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1405, SEQ ID NO: 1406, SEQ ID NO: 1407, SEQ ID NO: 1408, SEQ ID NO: 1409, SEQ ID NO: 1412, SEQ ID NO: 1413, SEQ ID NO: 1414, SEQ ID NO: 1416, SEQ ID NO: 1417, SEQ ID NO: 1418, SEQ ID NO: 1419, SEQ ID NO: 1422, SEQ ID NO: 1423, SEQ ID NO: 1424 and SEQ ID NO: 1425 and further comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1421 (GPSSGAPPPS), or SEQ ID NO: 1450, linked to the carboxy terminal amino acid (position 24) of the peptide or \nClass\n 5 peptide, is used to suppress appetite and inducing weight loss/weight maintenance. In some embodiments the administered peptide or \nClass\n 5 peptide comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1416, SEQ ID NO: 1417, SEQ ID NO: 1418 and SEQ ID NO: 1419, further comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1421 (GPSSGAPPPS) linked to the carboxy terminal amino acid (position 24) of the Class peptide. In some embodiments the method comprises administering a peptide or \nClass\n 5 peptide comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1445 or SEQ ID NO: 1446.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, it is expected that the \nClass\n 5 peptides disclosed herein can be similarly modified to decrease their susceptibility to premature chemical cleavage in aqueous buffers. In accordance with some embodiments the \nClass\n 5 peptides described herein can be further modified to enhance their stability in aqueous solutions by replacing the native aspartic amino acid, located at \ncorresponding position\n 15 of native glucagon, with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of cysteic acid, glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid and homocysteic acid. In accordance with some embodiments the aspartic acid residue at \nposition\n 10 of \nclass\n 5 peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1405, SEQ ID NO: 1406, SEQ ID NO: 1407 or SEQ ID NO: 1408 can be substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of cysteic acid, glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid and homocysteic acid, and in some embodiments the native aspartic acid at \nposition\n 10 of SEQ ID NO: 1405, SEQ ID NO: 1406, SEQ ID NO: 1407 or SEQ ID NO: 1408 is replaced with glutamic acid. In accordance with some embodiments a \nclass\n 5 peptide having improved stability in aqueous solutions is provided wherein the antagonist comprises a modified sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1409, wherein the modification comprises substitution of the Asp at \nposition\n 10 of SEQ ID NO: 1409 with Glu. In some embodiments a \nclass\n 5 peptide is provided comprising a sequence selected form the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1422, SEQ ID NO: 1423, SEQ ID NO: 1424 and SEQ ID NO: 1425. In some embodiments the \nclass\n 5 peptide is amidated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Asp-Ser sequence at position 15-16 of native glucagon has been identified as a uniquely unstable dipeptide that leads to premature chemical cleavage of the native hormone in aqueous buffers. For example, when maintained at 0.01N HCl at 37° C. for 2 weeks, more than 50% of the native glucagon may be cleaved into fragments. The two liberated cleavage peptides 1-15 and 16-29 are devoid of glucagon-like biological activity and thus represent a limitation on the aqueous pre-formulation of glucagon and its related analogs. The selective chemical substitution of the Asp at \nposition\n 15 of native glucagon with Glu has been observed to virtually eliminate chemical cleavage of the 15-16 peptide bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet further exemplary embodiments, any of the foregoing compounds can be further modified to improve stability by modifying the amino acid corresponding to position 15 or 16 of native glucagon, to reduce degradation of the peptide over time, especially in acidic or alkaline buffers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModification to Enhance Solubility\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nclass\n 5 peptide can be further modified to improve the peptide's solubility in aqueous solutions at physiological pH, in certain aspects, while retaining the glucagon antagonist and GLP-1 agonist activity. Introduction of hydrophilic groups at positions corresponding to \npositions\n 12, 15, 16, 19 and 24 of the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1405, or at positions 12, 16, 19 or 24 of the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1406 can improve the solubility of the resulting peptides in solutions having a physiological pH, while retaining the parent compounds glucagon antagonist and GLP agonist activity. Therefore, in some embodiments the presently disclosed \nclass\n 5 peptide that are further modified to comprise one or more hydrophilic groups covalently linked to the side chains of amino acids corresponding to amino acid positions 12, 15, 16, 19 and 24 of the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1405 or SEQ ID NO: 1406. In a further embodiment the side chains of amino acids corresponding to amino acid positions 16 and 19 of SEQ ID NO: 1405 or SEQ ID NO: 1406 are covalently bound to hydrophilic groups, and in some embodiments the hydrophilic group is polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nClass\n 5 glucagon related peptides can be modified by introducing charge at its carboxy terminus to enhance the solubility of the peptide while retaining the agonist properties of the peptide. The enhanced solubility allows for the preparation and storage of glucagon solutions at near neutral pH. Formulating glucagon solutions at relatively neutral pHs (e.g. pH of about 6.0 to about 8.0) improves the long term stability of the \nClass\n 5 peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApplicants anticipate that \nclass\n 5 peptides disclosed herein can be similarly modified to enhance their solubility in aqueous solutions at relatively neutral pH (e.g. pH of about 6.0 to about 8.0), in some cases, while retaining a glucagon antagonist and GLP-1 activity. Accordingly, some embodiments is directed to a glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 of SEQ ID NO: 1405, SEQ ID NO: 1406, SEQ ID NO: 1407 or SEQ ID NO: 1408 that has been further modified relative to the native amino acids present at positions 6-29 of the wild type glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1401) to add charge to the peptide by the substitution of native non-charged amino acids with charged amino acids, or the addition of charged amino acids to the carboxy terminus. In accordance with some embodiments, one to three of the non-charged native amino acids of the \nclass\n 5 peptides disclosed herein are replaced with a charged amino acid. In some embodiments the charged amino acid is selected from the group consisting of lysine, arginine, histidine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid. More particularly, applicants have discovered that substituting the normally occurring amino acid corresponding to position 28 and/or 29 (relative to native glucagon) with charged amino acids, and/or the addition of one to two charged amino acids at the carboxy terminus of the peptide, enhances the solubility and stability of the \nClass\n 5 peptide in aqueous solutions at physiologically relevant pHs (i.e., a pH of about 6.5 to about 7.5). Accordingly such modifications of \nclass\n 5 peptides are anticipated to have a similar effect on the solubility in aqueous solutions, particularly at a pH ranging from about 5.5 to about 8.0, while retaining the parent peptide's biological activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments the \nclass\n 5 peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1405, SEQ ID NO: 1406, SEQ ID NO: 1407 or SEQ ID NO: 1408 is modified by the substitution of the native amino acid at position 23 and/or 24 of those sequences with a negatively charged amino acid (e.g., aspartic acid or glutamic acid) and optionally the addition of a negatively charged amino acid (e.g., aspartic acid or glutamic acid) to the carboxy terminus of the peptide. In an alternative embodiment a \nclass\n 5 peptide comprising SEQ ID NO: 1405, SEQ ID NO: 1406, SEQ ID NO: 1407 or SEQ ID NO: 1408 is modified by the substitution of the native amino acid at position 24 of SEQ ID NO: 1405, SEQ ID NO: 1406, SEQ ID NO: 1407 or SEQ ID NO: 1408 with a positively charged amino acid (e.g., lysine, arginine or histidine) and optionally the addition of one or two positively charged amino acid (e.g., lysine, arginine or histidine) on the carboxy terminus of the peptide. In accordance with some embodiments a \nclass\n 5 peptide having improved solubility and stability is provided wherein the analog comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1415 or SEQ ID NO: 1451 with the proviso that at least one amino acids at position, 23, or 24 of SEQ ID NO: 1415 or SEQ ID NO: 1451 is substituted with an acidic amino acid and/or an additional acidic amino acid added at the carboxy terminus of SEQ ID NO: 1415 or SEQ ID NO: 1451. In some embodiments the acidic amino acids are independently selected from the group consisting of Asp, Glu, cysteic acid and homocysteic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments a \nclass\n 5 peptide having improved solubility and stability is provided wherein the antagonist comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1416, SEQ ID NO: 1417, SEQ ID NO: 1418 or SEQ ID NO: 1419. In accordance with some embodiments a glucagon agonist is provided comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1416 or SEQ ID NO: 1417. In some embodiments the \nclass\n 5 peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1420.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments a \nclass\n 5 peptide is provided comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1415 or SEQ ID NO: 1451. In some embodiments, \nposition\n 4 of SEQ ID NO: 1415 or SEQ ID NO: 1451 is aspartic acid, glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, cysteic acid or homocysteic acid, and in some embodiments position 4 is aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteic acid or homocysteic acid, and in a \nfurther embodiment position\n 4 of SEQ ID NO: 1415 or SEQ ID NO: 1451 is aspartic acid or glutamic acid, and in some embodiments position 4 of SEQ ID NO: 1415 or SEQ ID NO: 1451 is aspartic acid.

For example, the disclosed bioactive peptide prodrug analogs are believed to be suitable for any use that has previously been described for its corresponding parent bioactive peptide. Accordingly, the glucagon related peptide prodrug analogs described herein can be used to treat hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes, or other metabolic diseases that result from high/low blood levels of glucagon or high/low blood glucose levels. In accordance with some embodiments the patient to be treated using the prodrug disclosed herein is a domesticated animal, and in another embodiment the patient to be treated is a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the prodrugs are used to reduce or suppress appetite, reduce food intake, induce weight loss, or assist in weight maintenance. Such methods for reducing appetite or promoting loss of body weight are expected to be useful in reducing body weight, preventing weight gain, or treating obesity of various causes, including drug-induced obesity, and reducing complications associated with obesity including vascular disease (coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, ischemia reperfusion, etc.), hypertension, onset of diabetes type II, hyperlipidemia and musculoskeletal diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the prodrugs are used in conjunction with parenteral administration of nutrients to non-diabetic patients in a hospital setting, e.g., to patients receiving parenteral nutrition or total parenteral nutrition. Nonliminting examples include surgery patients, patients in comas, patients with digestive tract illness, or a nonfunctional gastrointestinal tract (e.g. due to surgical removal, blockage or impaired absorptive capacity, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, gastrointestinal tract obstruction, gastrointestinal tract fistula, acute pancreatitis, ischemic bowel, major gastrointestinal surgery, certain congenital gastrointestinal tract anomalies, prolonged diarrhea, or short bowel syndrome due to surgery, patients in shock, and patients undergoing healing processes often receive parenteral administration of carbohydrates along with various combinations of lipids, electrolytes, minerals, vitamins and amino acids. The glucagon superfamily peptide prodrug and the parenteral nutrition composition can be administered at the same time, at different times, before, or after each other, provided that the glucagon superfamily peptide prodrug is exerting the desired biological effect at the time that the parenteral nutrition composition is being digested. For example, the parenteral nutrition may be administered, 1, 2 or 3 times per day, while the glucagon superfamily peptide prodrug is administered once every other day, three times a week, two times a week, once a week, once every 2 weeks, once every 3 weeks, or once a month.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolic Syndrome, also known as metabolic syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome or Reaven's syndrome, is a disorder that affects over 50 million Americans. Metabolic Syndrome is typically characterized by a clustering of at least three or more of the following risk factors: (1) abdominal obesity (excessive fat tissue in and around the abdomen), (2) atherogenic dyslipidemia (blood fat disorders including high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol that enhance the accumulation of plaque in the artery walls), (3) elevated blood pressure, (4) insulin resistance or glucose intolerance, (5) prothrombotic state (e.g. high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in blood), and (6) pro-inflammatory state (e.g. elevated C-reactive protein in blood). Other risk factors may include aging, hormonal imbalance and genetic predisposition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolic Syndrome is associated with an increased the risk of coronary heart disease and other disorders related to the accumulation of vascular plaque, such as stroke and peripheral vascular disease, referred to as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients with Metabolic Syndrome may progress from an insulin resistant state in its early stages to full blown type II diabetes with further increasing risk of ASCVD. Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, the relationship between insulin resistance, Metabolic Syndrome and vascular disease may involve one or more concurrent pathogenic mechanisms including impaired insulin-stimulated vasodilation, insulin resistance-associated reduction in NO availability due to enhanced oxidative stress, and abnormalities in adipocyte-derived hormones such as adiponectin (Lteif and Mather, Can. J. Cardiol. 20 (suppl. B):66B-76B (2004)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III), any three of the following traits in the same individual meet the criteria for Metabolic Syndrome: (a) abdominal obesity (a waist circumference over 102 cm in men and over 88 cm in women); (b) serum triglycerides (150 mg/dl or above); (c) HDL cholesterol (40 mg/dl or lower in men and 50 mg/dl or lower in women); (d) blood pressure (130/85 or more); and (e) fasting blood glucose (110 mg/dl or above). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an individual having high insulin levels (an elevated fasting blood glucose or an elevated post meal glucose alone) with at least two of the following criteria meets the criteria for Metabolic Syndrome: (a) abdominal obesity (waist to hip ratio of greater than 0.9, a body mass index of at least 30 kg/m\n2\n, or a waist measurement over 37 inches); (b) cholesterol panel showing a triglyceride level of at least 150 mg/dl or an HDL cholesterol lower than 35 mg/dl; (c) blood pressure of 140/90 or more, or on treatment for high blood pressure). (Mathur, Ruchi, “Metabolic Syndrome,” ed. Shiel, Jr., William C., MedicineNet.com, May 11, 2009).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor purposes herein, if an individual meets the criteria of either or both of the criteria set forth by the 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel or the WHO, that individual is considered as afflicted with Metabolic Syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being bound to any particular theory, glucagon peptides described herein are useful for treating Metabolic Syndrome. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of preventing or treating Metabolic Syndrome, or reducing one, two, three or more risk factors thereof, in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a glucagon peptide described herein in an amount effective to prevent or treat Metabolic Syndrome, or the risk factor thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to a wide spectrum of liver disease ranging from simple fatty liver (steatosis), to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), to cirrhosis (irreversible, advanced scarring of the liver). All of the stages of NAFLD have in common the accumulation of fat (fatty infiltration) in the liver cells (hepatocytes). Simple fatty liver is the abnormal accumulation of a certain type of fat, triglyceride, in the liver cells with no inflammation or scarring. In NASH, the fat accumulation is associated with varying degrees of inflammation (hepatitis) and scarring (fibrosis) of the liver. The inflammatory cells can destroy the liver cells (hepatocellular necrosis). In the terms “steatohepatitis” and “steatonecrosis”, steato refers to fatty infiltration, hepatitis refers to inflammation in the liver, and necrosis refers to destroyed liver cells. NASH can ultimately lead to scarring of the liver (fibrosis) and then irreversible, advanced scarring (cirrhosis). Cirrhosis that is caused by NASH is the last and most severe stage in the NAFLD spectrum. (Mendler, Michel, “Fatty Liver: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH),” ed. Schoenfield, Leslie J., MedicineNet.com, Aug. 29, 2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlcoholic Liver Disease, or Alcohol-Induced Liver Disease, encompasses three pathologically distinct liver diseases related to or caused by the excessive consumption of alcohol: fatty liver (steatosis), chronic or acute hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Alcoholic hepatitis can range from a mild hepatitis, with abnormal laboratory tests being the only indication of disease, to severe liver dysfunction with complications such as jaundice (yellow skin caused by bilirubin retention), hepatic encephalopathy (neurological dysfunction caused by liver failure), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen), bleeding esophageal varices (varicose veins in the esophagus), abnormal blood clotting and coma. Histologically, alcoholic hepatitis has a characteristic appearance with ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, inflammation with neutrophils and sometimes Mallory bodies (abnormal aggregations of cellular intermediate filament proteins). Cirrhosis is characterized anatomically by widespread nodules in the liver combined with fibrosis. (Worman, Howard J., “Alcoholic Liver Disease”, Columbia University Medical Center website).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being bound to any particular theory, \nClass\n 2 and \nClass\n 3 glucagon related peptides described herein are useful for the treatment of Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or any stage thereof, including, for example, steatosis, steatohepatitis, hepatitis, hepatic inflammation, NASH, cirrhosis, or complications thereof. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of preventing or treating Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or any stage thereof, in a subject comprising administering to a subject a \nClass\n 2 or \nClass\n 3 glucagon peptide described herein in an amount effective to prevent or treat Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or the stage thereof. Such treatment methods include reduction in one, two, three or more of the following: liver fat content, incidence or progression of cirrhosis, incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, signs of inflammation, e.g. abnormal hepatic enzyme levels (e.g., aspartate aminotransferase AST and/or alanine aminotransferase ALT, or LDH), elevated serum ferritin, elevated serum bilirubin, and/or signs of fibrosis, e.g. elevated TGF-beta levels. In preferred embodiments, the \nClass\n 2 or \nClass\n 3 glucagon peptides are used treat patients who have progressed beyond simple fatty liver (steatosis) and exhibit signs of inflammation or hepatitis. Such methods may result, for example, in reduction of AST and/or ALT levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGLP-1 and exendin-4 have been shown to have some neuroprotective effect. The invention also provides uses of the glucagon superfamily peptides in treating neurodegenerative diseases, including but not limited to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Amylotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, other demyelination related disorders, senile dementia, subcortical dementia, arteriosclerotic dementia, AIDS-associated dementia, or other dementias, a central nervous system cancer, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, stroke or cerebral ischemia, cerebral vasculitis, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome, Guillain Barre syndrome, Wilson disease, Pick's disease, neuroinflammatory disorders, encephalitis, encephalomyelitis or meningitis of viral, fungal or bacterial origin, or other central nervous system infections, prion diseases, cerebellar ataxias, cerebellar degeneration, spinocerebellar degeneration syndromes, Friedreichs ataxia, ataxia telangiectasia, spinal dysmyotrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, dystonia, muscle spasticity, tremor, retinitis pigmentosa, striatonigral degeneration, mitochondrial encephalo-myopathies, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, hepatic encephalopathies, renal encephalopathies, metabolic encephalopathies, toxin-induced encephalopathies, and radiation-induced brain damage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the invention provides a method of preventing or treating neurodegenerative diseases, or reducing one, two, three or more risk factors thereof, in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a glucagon peptide described herein in an amount effective to prevent or treat a neurodegenerative disease, or the risk factor thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method of treating in accordance with the present invention comprises the steps of administering the presently disclosed prodrugs to a patient using any standard route of administration, including parenterally, such as intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously or intramuscularly, intrathecally, transdermally, rectally, orally, nasally or by inhalation. In some embodiments the composition is administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, optionally into a depot or as part of a slow-release composition.\n\n\n \nCompositions and Combinations\n\n\n \n \n \nThe prodrugs of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with a second agent such as anti-diabetic or anti-obesity agents.

It is estimated that over half of cancer patients experience catabolic wasting which is characterized by unintended and progressive weight loss, weakness, and low body fat and muscle. The syndrome is equally common in AIDS patients and can also be present in bacterial and parasitic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic diseases of the bowel, liver, lungs, and heart. It is usually associated with anorexia and can manifest as a condition in aging or as a result of physical trauma. Catabolic wasting is a symptom that diminishes the quality of life, worsens the underlying condition, and is a major cause of death.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions comprising the prodrugs disclosed herein can be formulated and administered to patients using standard pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and routes of administration known to those skilled in the art.

Although certain non-natural amino acids cannot be expressed by standard recombinant DNA techniques, techniques for their preparation are known in the art. Compounds of this invention that encompass non-peptide portions may be synthesized by standard organic chemistry reactions, in addition to standard peptide chemistry reactions when applicable.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nGeneral Pegylation Protocol: (Cys-maleimido)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, the glucagon related peptide containing Cys is dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (5-10 mg/ml) and 0.01 Methylenediamine tetraacetic acid is added (10-15% of total volume). Excess (2-fold) maleimido methoxyPEG reagent (Dow) is added and the reaction stirred at room temperature while monitoring reaction progress by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). After 8-24 hrs, the reaction mixture is acidified and loaded onto a preparative reverse phase column for purification using 0.1% tetrafluoroacetic acid (TFA)/acetonitrile in the gradient mode. The appropriate fractions were combined and lyophilized to give the desired pegylated derivatives.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nDipeptide Cleavage Half Time (in PBS) Determination on Model Peptide\n\n\n \n \n \nA model hexapeptide (HSRGTF-NH\n2\n; SEQ ID NO:715) was used as a model to determine the half life of various dipeptides linked to the hexapeptide through an amide bond. The hexapeptide was assembled on a peptide synthesizer. To confirm the integrity of the synthesis and the availability of an extendable N-terminus, the peptide-bound resin was cleaved by hydrofluoric acid (HF) and analyzed. Then Boc-protected sarcosine and lysine were successively introduced to the peptide-bound resin to produce peptide A (dipeptide+model peptide). Peptide A was cleaved by HF and purified by preparative HPLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparative Purification using HPLC:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurification was performed using HPLC analysis on a silica based 1×25 cm Vydac C18 (5μ particle size, 300 A° pore size) column. The instruments used were: Waters Associates model 600 pump, Injector model 717, and UV detector model 486. A wavelength of 230 nm was used for all samples. Solvent A contained 10% CH\n3\nCN/0.1% TFA in distilled water, and solvent B contained 0.1% TFA in CH\n3\nCN. A linear gradient was employed (0 to 100% B in 2 hours). The flow rate was 10 mL/min and the fraction size was 4 mL. From about 150 mg of crude peptide, 30 mg of the pure peptide (about 20% yield) was typically obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide A was dissolved at 1 mg/mL concentration in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer (PH 7.4). Then it was incubated at 37° C. in a water bath. The analytical samples were collected at different time points (5 h, 8 h, 24 h, 31 h, 47 h) and quenched by the same volume of 0.1% TFA. HPLC was used to monitor the cleavage reaction. The data were qualitatively monitored by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and quantitatively analyzed by HPLC Peak Simple Chromatography software to obtain the retention time and relative peak area for the prodrug modification.\n\n\n \nAnalysis Using Mass Spectrometry\n\n\n \n \n \nThe mass spectra were obtained using a Sciex API-III electrospray quadrapole mass spectrometer with a standard electron spray ionization (ESI) ion source. Ionization conditions that were used are as follows: ESI in the positive-ion mode; ion spray voltage, 3.9 kV; orifice potential, 60 V. The nebulizing and curtain gas used was nitrogen at a flow rate of 0.9 L/min. Mass spectra were recorded from 600-1800 Thompsons (Th) at 0.5 Th per step and 2 msec dwell time. The sample (about 1 mg/mL) was dissolved in 50% aqueous acetonitrile with 1% acetic acid and introduced by an external syringe pump at the rate of 5 μL/min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the peptides were analyzed in PBS solution by ESI-MS, they were first desalted using a ZipTip solid phase extraction tip containing 0.6 μL C4 resin, according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, Mass., see http://www.millipore.com/catalogue.nsf/docs/C5737).\n\n\n \n \nAnalysis using HPLC\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HPLC analyses were performed using a Beckman System Gold Chromatography system using a UV detector at 214 nm and a 150 mm×4.6 mm C8 Vydac column. The flow rate was 1 mL/min. Solvent A contained 0.1% TFA in distilled water, and solvent B contained 0.1% TFA in 90% CH\n3\nCN. A linear gradient was employed (0% to 30% B in 10 minutes). The data were collected and analyzed using Peak Simple Chromatography software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe initial rates of cleavage were used to measure the rate constant for the dissociation of the respective prodrugs. The concentrations of the prodrug and the drug were estimated from their peak areas, ‘a’ and ‘b’ respectively, for each of the different collection times (see Table 1). The first order dissociation rate constants of the prodrugs were determined by plotting the logarithm of the concentration of the prodrug at various time intervals. The slope of this plot gives the rate constant I′. The half lives of the degradation of the various prodrugs were then calculated by using the formula t\n1/2\n=0.693/k.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHPLC and LC-MS data of Cleavage of A peptide (lys-sar-HSRGTF-NH\n2\n) in PBS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5 h\n\n\n8 h\n\n\n24 h\n\n\n31 h\n\n\n47 h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHPLC peaks\n\n\na\n\n\nb\n\n\na\n\n\nb\n\n\na\n\n\nb\n\n\na\n\n\nb\n\n\na\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetention time(min)\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n4.8\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n4.8\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n4.8\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n4.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMolecular weight\n\n\n702\n\n\n902\n\n\n702\n\n\n902\n\n\n702\n\n\n902\n\n\n702\n\n\n902\n\n\n702\n\n\n902\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative peak area(%)\n\n\n26.5\n\n\n73.5\n\n\n28.9\n\n\n71.1\n\n\n28.8\n\n\n71.2\n\n\n77.7\n\n\n22.3\n\n\n90.0\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe half lives of the degradation of the various prodrugs were calculated by using the formula t\n1/2\n=0.693/k and the half life of the lys-sar combination on model peptide HSRGTF-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 715) was determined to be 14.0 h.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nDipeptide Cleavage Half Time (in Plasma) Determination on D-Model Peptide\n\n\n \n \n \nAnother model hexapeptide (dHdTdRGdTdF-NH\n2 \nSEQ ID NO: 716) was used as a model to determine the half-life of dipeptides combination in plasma.

The standard procedure is described briefly here, and the details are discussed later.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaterials:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPAM resin (PAM resin is OCH\n2\n-phenylacetamidomethyl-copolystyrene-1% divinylbenzene), (100-180 mesh, 1% DVB cross-linked polystyrene; loading of 0.7-1.0 mmol/g), Boc-protected and Fmoc protected amino acids were purchased from Midwest Biotech. Other reagents such as the α-hydroxy-acids (phenyllacetic acid and glycolic acid) were purchased from Aldrich. The solid phase peptide syntheses using Boc-protected amino acids were performed on an Applied Biosystem 430A Peptide Synthesizer. Fmoc protected amino acid synthesis was performed using the Applied Biosystems Model 433 Peptide Synthesizer. The manual synthesis of depsi-peptides was performed in sintered reaction vessels using analogous procedures (Schnolzer, M., et al., (1992) Int J Pept Protein Res 40(3-4):180-193).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide Synthesis (Boc Amino Acids/HF Cleavage):\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis of these analogs was performed on the Applied Biosystem Model 430A Peptide Synthesizer. Synthetic peptides were constructed by sequential addition of amino acids, and activated esters of each amino acid were generated by the addition of 1.9 mmol (3.8 mL of a 0.5 M solution) of 3-(Diethoxy-phosphoryloxy)-3H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazin-4-one (DEPBT) in DMF to a cartridge containing 2 mmol of Boc protected amino acid. The amino acids were dissolved by bubbling nitrogen gas through the cartridge. One mL of N,N-Diisopropylethylamine was added to the cartridge to effect ester formation. This solution was transferred to the reaction vessel containing the 0.2 mmol of the C-terminal residue attached to the PAM resin, vortexed several times, and allowed to couple to the resin for 10 minutes. After washing to remove the unreacted reagents, the N-terminal Boc protecting group was removed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for 5 minutes. The resin was washed with DMF and the cycle was repeated for the desired number of steps until the chain was assembled. The reaction vessel at the end of the synthesis (typically 30 amino acids) contained approximately 1.2-1.5 g of protected peptidyl-PAM resin. The resin was washed numerous times with dimethylformamide (DMF), treated with trifluoroacetic acid to remove the last t-Boc protecting group and finally washed several additional times with DMF, dichloromethane (DCM) and dried.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptidyl-resin was treated with anhydrous HF (procedure detailed later in this section), and this typically yielded approximately 350 mg (about 50% yield) of a crude deprotected-peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide Synthesis (Fmoc Amino Acids/HF Cleavage):\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis synthesis scheme was performed manually with a few amino acids at selective sites. In this work, the Fmoc amino acids were used only to synthesize internal serine prodrugs, as a part of a wider synthetic strategy. Here, it is to be noted that although Fmoc chemistry has been used in the synthesis, the peptides have always been built on PAM resin that required treatment with HF to cleave the peptide from the solid support. The yield of these peptides is approximately as stated earlier for Boc/PAM synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesis was carried out as described in the previous section. At the end of the coupling step, the peptidyl-resin was treated with 20% piperidine to remove the N-terminal Fmoc protecting group. It was washed repeatedly with DMF and this repetitive cycle was repeated for the desired number of coupling steps. The peptidyl-resin at the end of the entire synthesis was dried by using DCM, and the peptide was cleaved from the resin with anhydrous HF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepsi-Peptide Synthesis (Amino Ester Formation)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this case, the peptidyl-resin had an α-hydroxyl-N terminal extension instead of a N-terminal amine and the acylation was done at the α-hydroxyl group. This reaction takes a longer time than that of the amide bond formation because the hydroxyl group is a weaker nucleophile as compared to the amine. The reaction time was typically 12 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInitially, the activated esters of each amino acid were generated by the addition of 1 mmol (0.155 mL of Diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) to a cartridge containing a solution of 2 mmol of Boc protected amino acid residue in 2 mL DCM. This cartridge was cooled to 10° C. for 10 minutes and 0.9 mmol (244 mg) of dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) was added to the cartridge to accelerate ester formation. This mixture was transferred to the reaction vessel containing the peptidyl-resin upon which the peptide was synthesized. The reaction vessel was stirred for 12 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptidyl-resin was dried using DCM and the synthesis of the desired peptide was continued. The peptidyl-resin at the end of the entire synthesis was dried by using DCM, and finally treated with anhydrous HF to generate the desired peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nN-Terminal Hydroxyl Peptide Synthesis (α-Hydroxyl-N Terminal Extension)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this reaction, the free amine of the peptidyl-resin reacts with an α-hydroxyl acid to form an α-hydroxyl-N terminal extension. In this regard, two such α-hydroxyl acids were used namely, glycolic acid (OH-glycine) and phenyllacetic acid (OH-phenylalanine). These syntheses were also performed manually. The peptides were constructed by addition of the α-hydroxyl acid, and activated esters of the α-hydroxyl acid were generated by the addition of 0.9 mmol of DEPBT (270 mg) to a cartridge containing a solution of 1 mmol of Boc protected residue in 2 mL DMF. DIEA (N,N-Diisopropylethylamine, 0.5 mL) was added to the cartridge to accelerate ester formation. This mixture was transferred to the reaction vessel containing the peptidyl-resin upon which the peptide was synthesized. The reaction time was 6 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptidyl-resin was dried using DCM and the synthesis of the desired peptide was continued. The peptidyl-resin at the end of the entire synthesis was dried by using DCM, and cleaved by anhydrous HF to generate the free peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHF Treatment of the Peptidyl-Resin\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptidyl-resin (30 mg to 200 mg) was placed in the hydrogen fluoride (HF) reaction vessel for cleavage. 500 μL of p-cresol was added to the vessel as a carbonium ion scavenger. The vessel was attached to the HF system and submerged in a methanol/dry ice mixture. The vessel was evacuated with a vacuum pump and 10 mL of HF was distilled to the reaction vessel. This reaction mixture of the peptidyl-resin and the HF was stirred for one hour at 0° C., after which a vacuum was established and the HF was quickly evacuated (10-15 min). The vessel was removed carefully and filled with approximately 35 mL of ether to precipitate the peptide and to extract the p-cresol and small molecule organic protecting groups resulting from HF treatment. This mixture was filtered utilizing a teflon filter and repeated twice to remove all excess cresol. This filtrate was discarded. The precipitated peptide dissolved in approximately 20 mL of 10% acetic acid (aq). This filtrate, which contained the desired peptide, was collected and lyophilized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis Using Mass Spectrometry\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mass spectra were obtained using a Sciex API-III electrospray quadrapole mass spectrometer with a standard ESI ion source. Ionization conditions that were used are as follows: ESI in the positive-ion mode; ion spray voltage, 3.9 kV; orifice potential, 60 V. The nebulizing and curtain gas used was nitrogen with a flow rate of 0.9 L/min. Mass spectra were recorded from 600-1800 Thompsons at 0.5 Th per step and 2 msec dwell time. The sample (about 1 mg/mL) was dissolved in 50% aqueous acetonitrile with 1% acetic acid and introduced by an external syringe pump at the rate of 5 μL/min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the peptides were analyzed in PBS solution by ESI-MS, they were first desalted using a ZipTip solid phase extraction tip containing 0.6 μL C4 resin, according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, Mass., see the Millipore website of the world wide web at millipore.com/catalogue.nsf/docs/C5737).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analysis:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreliminary analyses were performed with these crude peptides for an approximation of their relative conversion rates in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) buffer (pH, 7.2) using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and MALDI analysis. The crude peptide samples were dissolved in the PBS buffer at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. One mL of the resulting solution was stored in a 1.5 mL HPLC vial, which was then sealed and incubated at 37° C. Aliquots of 100 μL were drawn out at various time intervals, cooled to room temperature and analyzed by HPLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HPLC analyses were performed using a Beckman System Gold Chromatography system using a UV detector at 214 nm. HPLC analyses were performed on a 150 mm×4.6 mm C18 Vydac column. The flow rate was 1 mL/min. Solvent A contained 0.1% TFA in distilled water, and solvent B contained 0.1% TFA in 90% CH\n3\nCN. A linear gradient was employed (40% to 70% B in 15 minutes). The data were collected and analyzed using Peak Simple Chromatography software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe initial rates of hydrolysis were used to measure the rate constant for the dissociation of the respective prodrugs. The concentrations of the prodrug and the drug were estimated from their peak areas respectively. The first order dissociation rate constants of the prodrugs were determined by plotting the logarithm of the concentration of the prodrug at various time intervals. The slope of this plot gives the rate constant 1′. The half lives of the degradation of the various prodrugs were then calculated by using the formula t\n1/2\n=0.693/k.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparative Purification Using HPLC:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce a prodrug displaying an appropriate t\n1/2 \nwas identified, the prodrug was purified. The purification was performed using HPLC analysis on a silica based 1×25 cm Vydac C18 (5μ particle size, 300 A° pore size) column. The instruments used were: Waters Associates model 600 pump, Injector model 717, and UV detector model 486. A wavelength of 214 nm was used for all samples. Solvent A contained 10% CH\n3\nCN/0.1% TFA in distilled water, and solvent B contained 0.1% TFA in CH\n3\nCN. A linear gradient was employed (0 to 100% B in 2 hours). The flow rate was 1.2 mL/min and the fraction size was 6 mL. From about 350 mg of crude peptide, 80 mg of the pure peptide (about 23% yield) was typically obtained.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nBioassay Experimental Design: Luciferase-Based Reporter Gene Assay for Camp Detection\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of each glucagon and GLP-1 analog or prodrug to induce cAMP was measured in a firefly luciferase-based reporter assay. The cAMP production that is induced is directly proportional to the glucagon or GLP-1 binding to its receptor. HEK293 cells co-transfected with the glucagon or GLP-1 receptor, respectively, and luciferase gene linked to a cAMP responsive element were employed for the bioassay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells were serum-deprived by culturing 16 hours in Dulbecco Minimum Essential Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) supplemented with 0.25% Bovine Growth Serum (HyClone, Logan, Utah) and then incubated with serial dilutions of either GLP-1 analogs or prodrugs for 5 hours at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nin 96 well poly-D-Lysine-coated “Biocoat” plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). At the end of the incubation, 100 μL of LucLite luminescence substrate reagent (Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, Mass.) were added to each well. The plate was shaken briefly, incubated 10 min in the dark and light output was measured on MicroBeta-1450 liquid scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, Mass.). The effective 50% concentrations (EC\n50\n) were calculated by using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, Mass.).\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nBioactivity of Glucagon Related Peptide Amide-Based Prodrugs\n\n\n \n \n \nI) GLP-1\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe C\n24 \nGLP-1(7-36) peptide (HAEGTFTSDVSSYLEGQAAKEFICWLVKGR; SEQ ID NO: 717) was assembled on a peptide synthesizer. To confirm that a feasible extended N-terminus could be used for the prodrug modification, a small percentage of peptide bound resin was cleaved by HF to check the validity of the synthesis. The synthesized peptide has a mass of 3329.8 Daltons. The receptor binding activity of GLP-1 was determined in the GLP-1-receptor Luciferase assay described in Example 5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nII) Adding Dipeptides to the N Terminus of GLP\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDipeptides were covalently attached to the N-terminus of glucagon or GLP-1 to study differential tendencies for intramolecular cyclization and cleavage through diketopiperazine (DKP) formation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biologically inactive dipeptide-extended GLP-1 and glucagon analogs were converted to the active peptide drug upon cleavage of the amide bond along with formation of DKP. The same conversion can be performed with either sarcosine (Sar) or proline as amino acid ‘B’ in the A-B dipeptide of GLP-1 analogs. Prodrugs of varying half lives were envisioned by chemically modifying the substituents on the alpha carbons of the first (A) and second (B) amino acids of the dipeptide of Formula I. For example, a dipeptide prodrug element comprising proline and amino-isobutyric acid (Aib) were successively introduced to the C\n24 \nGLP (SEQ ID NO: 717), so the first peptide was named Aib\n−1\n-P\n0\n,C\n24\nGLP(7-36) where the first amino acid (amino acid “Xaa\n−1\n”) of the peptide is amino-isobutyric acid and the second amino acid (amino acid “Xaa\n0\n”) is proline. All peptides mentioned hereafter will have the same systematic nomenclature. The stereochemistry for each synthesized compound is the L-isomer unless otherwise stated, when amino acids are designated with a superscript position number following the three letter amino acid code. The peptide was prepared synthetically by solid phase synthesis as described earlier. The synthesis was confirmed by ESI-MS analysis (3479.9 Da).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIII) GLP-Prodrug Pegylation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPegylation is a useful method to protect peptides and decrease clearance of the peptide by the kidneys. Accordingly, for the following experiments the prodrug Aib\n−1\n-P\n0\n,C\n24\nGLP(7-36) was pegylated by maleimido-functioned 40 k Da PEG on the —SH group of the 24-Cys of the Aib\n−1\n-P\n0\n,C\n24\nGLP(7-36) through a Michael reaction. The pegylated glucagon related peptide was named 40 k PEG-Aib\n−1\n-P\n0\n,C\n24\nGLP(7-36). This pegylated peptide was purified by preparative HPLC and confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS (44000-46000, broad peak).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIV) GLP-1 Activity in PBS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo explore the possible formation of DKP and simultaneous regeneration of the parent drug, 40 k PEG-Aib\n−1\nP\n0\n,C\n24\nGLP(7-36) was incubated in PBS buffer at 37° C. for approximately 10 days.

Note the compound Ac-Aib\n−1 \nPro\n0 \nPeptide A is incapable of cleaving to form a diketopiperazine, yet the compound shows some level of activity beyond that seen for vehicle. This is presumably due to low residual activity of the prodrug. Peptide A is a pegylated analog of glucagon comprising 7 substitutions relative to native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 701), a C-terminal amide, and pegylation with a maleimide-functionalized 40 k Da PEG.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n is a graph showing the change in body weight in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice injected intraperitoneally with a single weekly dose of 0.5, 3, 15 or 70 nmol/kg of either vehicle only (♦), Peptide A, (at 0.5▴, 3\n, 15▾ or 70\nnmol/kg/day) or Lys\n−1 \nSar\n0 \nPeptide A, (at 0.5Δ, 3\n, 15∇ or 70\nnmol/kg/day). At all doses the two drugs appear to be producing a similar effect and thus the benefit from the addition of the dipeptide prodrug element appears to be minimal.

A comparison between the results from the two prodrugs indicates the difference between the effectiveness of initial blood glucose control relative the time period that the prodrug has been circulating. In mice administered the “d” stereoisomer initial control of blood glucose (i.e., early time point) was poor when the prodrug was administered one hour prior to challenge and better when administered well before challenge (e.g., the greatest initial control was when \nprodrug\n 8 and 24 hour time points). This study supports the conclusion that the prodrugs comprising the “d” stereoisomer remain in an inactive form for a longer time period than prodrugs comprising a “1” stereoisomer.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\n \n \n \nThree prodrugs of Glucagon Superfamily Peptide B (“Peptide B”) and Glucagon Superfamily Peptide C (“Peptide C”) were synthesized according to the following procedures:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n1) dK-Sar-Peptide C, wherein dK is the D isoform of Lys, Sar is sarcosine, and Peptide C is an analog of glucagon comprising 8 substitutions relative to native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 701), a C-terminal amide, and pegylation with an iodoacetyl-functioned 40 k Da PEG.\n \nThe peptide sequence was assembled using solid-phase peptide synthesis.

Table 7 shows the rate of DKP formation using the dK-Sar and dK-Gly(N-Hexyl), dK-F(N-Me) prodrugs from Example 12.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nModulation of DKP Formation Rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndK-B-Glucagon Superfamily Peptide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAmino Acid “B” of the Dipeptide\n\n\n \n\n\nGlucagon Superfamily\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nProdrug\n\n\nt\n1/2 \n(h)\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly-N(Me)\n\n\n27\n\n\nPeptide C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly-N(Hexyl)\n\n\n14\n\n\nPeptide B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe-N(Me)\n\n\n60\n\n\nPeptide C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\n \n \n \nThe receptor binding activity of the following peptides and prodrugs in 20% human plasma were determined over time using the GLP-receptor Luciferase assay described in Example 5:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(A) GLP-1 (SEQ ID NO: 703),\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(B) Peptide C,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(C) dLys\n−1 \nSar\n0 \nChimera Peptide C, or\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(D) dLys\n−1 \nGly(N-Hexyl)° Peptide B.\n\n\n \n \nAs shown in Table 8, the activities of the dLys\n−1 \nSar\n0 \nand dLys\n−1 \nGly(N-Hexyl)\n0 \nprodrugs gradually increased over time and matched native GLP-1 within 48 hours (\nFIGS. 13A and 13B\n).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of Time on Conversion of Prodrug to Active Drug\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0 h*\n\n\n24 h\n\n\n48 h\n\n\n72 \nh\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide C\n \n \n \n \n\n\n 100%\n\n\n 77.3%\n\n\n 77.3% \n\n\n 81.0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndLys\n−1 \nSar\n0 \nPeptide C\n\n\n 5.7%\n\n\n104.5%\n\n\n287.5%\n\n\n246.4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndLys\n−1 \nGly(N-Hexyl)\n0 \n \n\n\n21.1%\n\n\n122.0%\n\n\n277.2%\n\n\n254.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide B\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*5 hour incubation assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\n \n \n \nLean, diet-induced obesity mice (N=14, strain: C57B16 WT)) were injected subcutaneously with a single weekly dose of 3, 10, or 30 nmol/kg of vehicle or one of the following compounds:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(A) Peptide C,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(B) dLys\n−1 \nSar\n0 \nPeptide C, or\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(C) dLys\n−1 \nGly(N-Hexyl)° Peptide B.\n\n\n \n \nThe mice had an average initial body weight of 31.2 g and were weighed on \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 1, 3, 5, and 7.
