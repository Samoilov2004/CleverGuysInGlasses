Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. \nField of the Invention\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds, compositions comprising a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound and use for preventing or treating pain or diarrhea in an animal comprising administering to an animal in need of such prevention or treatment an effective amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound.\n\n\n \n\n\n2. \nBackground of the Invention\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPain is the most common symptom for which patients seek medical advice and treatment. Pain can be acute or chronic. While acute pain is usually self-limited, chronic pain can persist for 3 months or longer and lead to significant changes in a patient's personality, lifestyle, functional ability or overall quality of life (\nK.M. Foley, Pain, in Cecil Textbook of Medicine 100-107, J.C. Bennett and F. Plum eds., 20th ed. 1996\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPain has been traditionally managed by administering a non-opioid analgesic, such as acetylsalicylic acid, choline magnesium trisalicylate, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, fenoprofen, diflusinal and naproxen; or an opioid analgesic, such as morphine, hydromorphone, methadone, levorphanol, fentanyl, oxycodone and oxymorphone. \nId.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnited States Patent No. \n \n6,576,650 B1\n \n, United States Patent \n \n6,166,039\n \n, and United States Patent No. \n \n5,849,761, to Yaksh\n \n and United States Patent No. \n \n6,573,282, to Yaksh et al.\n \n describe 1,4-substituted piperidine derivatives allegedly useful as peripherally active anti hyperalgesic opiates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnited States Patent No. \n \n6,362,203 B1 to Mogi et al.\n \n describes 4-hydroxy-4-phenylpiperidine derivatives that are alleged to exhibit peripheral analgesic action.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCanadian Patent Publication No. \n \n949560 of Carron et al.\n \n describes piperidine derivatives bearing substituents at the 1 and 4 positions that are alleged to be useful as analgesics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInternational Publication No. \n \nWO 02/38185 A2 of Dunn et al\n \n. describes 1,4 substituted piperidine compounds that are allegedly useful as an antihyperalgesic opiate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Abstract of International Publication No. \n \nWO 01/70689 A1\n \n also discloses piperidine derivatives carrying substituents at the 1 and 4 positions that are allegedly useful as opioid δ receptor agonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO 2004/046 132\n \n describes 4-tetrazolyl piperidine compounds with the same activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTraditional opioid analgesics exert their pharmacological activity once they have passed through the blood-brain barrier. But this passage through the blood-brain barrier can lead to undesirable central nervous system-mediated side effects, such as respiratory depression, increased drug tolerance, increased drug dependence, constipation and unwanted euphoria.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere remains a clear need for new drugs that are useful for treating or preventing pain or diarrhea and that reduce or avoid one or more side effects associated with traditional therapy for treating pain or diarrhea.\n\n\n \n\n\n3. \nSummary of the Invention\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention encompasses compounds having the formula (I):\n\n \n \n\nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAr\n1\n is phenyl, being unsubstituted or substituted with one, two, or three R\n2\n groups;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAr\n2\n is phenyl, being unsubstituted or substituted with one, two, or three R\n2\n groups;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAr\n4\n is phenyl, being unsubstituted or substituted with one, two, or three R\n2\n groups;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nG is -H, -C(O)(CH\n2\n)\nn\nCO\n2\nR\n4\n, -C(O)(CH\n2\n)\nn\nR\n5\n, -(C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkylene)CO\n2\nR\n4\n, or -(C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkylene)R\n5\n;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n1\n = -H, -C(O)NH\n2\n, -C(O)NHOH, -CO\n2\nR\n4\n, -CHO, -CN, -(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -C(O)NH(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -C(O)N(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl)\n2\n, -CF\n3\n, -CHF\n2\n, -CH\n2\nF,\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n2\n and R\n3\n are each independently -halogen, -C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl, -O(C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl), -NH(C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl), -N(C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl)2, -CF\n3\n, or -OCF\n3\n;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n4\n = -H, -C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl, -CH\n2\nO(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -CH\n2\nN(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl)\n2\n, or -CH\n2\nNH(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl);\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n5\n = -NH\n2\n, -NHSO\n2\nR\n4\n, -C(O)NH\n2\n, -C(O)NHOH, - SO\n2\nNH\n2\n, -C(O)NH(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -C(O)N(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl)\n2\n, -SO\n2\nNH(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -SO\n2\nN(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl)\n2\n, -H, -OH, -CN, or -C\n3\n-C\n8\n cycloalkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl, -(5- to 7-membered) heteroaryl each C\n3\n-C\n8\n cycloalkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl, -(5- to 7-membered) heteroaryl being unsubstituted or substituted with one or more R\n2\n groups;\n\n \n \n \nm = an integer ranging from 0 to 4;\n \nn = an integer ranging from 1 to 4;\n \np = 0 or 1; and\n \nq = an integer ranging from 1 to 6.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also encompasses compounds having the formula (II):\n\n \n \n\nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAr\ns\n is phenyl, being unsubstituted or substituted with one, two, or three R\n2\n groups;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAr\n4\n is phenyl, being unsubstituted or substituted with one, two, or three R\n2\n groups;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nG = H, -C(O)(CH\n2\n)\nn\nC(O)OR\n4\n, -C(O)(CH\n2\n)\nn\nR\n5\n, -(C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkylene)COOR\n4\n, or -(C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkylene)R\n5\n;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n1\n = -H, -C(O)NH\n2\n, -C(O)NHOH, -CO\n2\nR\n4\n, -CHO, -CN, -(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -C(O)NH(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -C(O)N(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl, -CF\n3\n, -CHF\n2\n, -CH\n2\nF,\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n2\n and R\n3\n are each independently halogen, -C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl, -O(C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl), -NH(C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl), -N(C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl)\n2\n, -CF\n3\n, or -OCF\n3\n;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n4\n = -H, -C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl, -CH\n2\nO(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -CH\n2\nN(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl)\n2\n, or -CH\n2\nNH(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl);\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n5\n = -NH2, -NHSO\n2\nR\n4\n, -C(O)NH\n2\n, -C(O)NHOH, - SO\n2\nNH\n2\n, -C(O)NH(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -C(O)N(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl)\n2\n, -SO\n2\nNH(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -SO\n2\nN(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl)\n2\n, -H, -OH, -CN, or -C\n3\n-C\n8\n cycloalkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl, -(5- to 7-membered) heteroaryl each -C\n3\n-C\n8\n cycloalkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl, -(5- to 7-membered) heteroaryl being unsubstituted or substituted with one or more R\n2\n groups;\n\n \n \n \nm = an integer ranging from 0 to 4;\n \nn = an integer ranging from 1 to 4;\n \np = 0 or 1; and\n \nq = an integer ranging from 1 to 6.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nA compound of formula (I) or (II) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (each being a \"4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound\") is useful for treating or preventing pain or diarrhea in an animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to compositions comprising a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.

using thionylchloride (\nJ.S. Pizey, Synthetic Reactions 2: 65 (1974\n)), or, as depicted, using oxalyl chloride. Bromoacid chlorides 2 are reacted with Z\n1\nZ\n2\nNH, optionally in the presence of base such as Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, to provide reactive intermediates 3.\n\n \n \n\nwhere -W- is -C(Ar\n1\n)(Ar\n2\n)- or -C(H)(Ar\n3\n)-, and m, Ar\n1\n, Ar\n2\n, and Ar\n3\n are as defined above.\n\n\n \n\n\n4.3.2 \nSynthesis of Compounds of Structure 10\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nScheme 2 depicts methods for making intermediates useful in the synthesis 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds of formula I and formula 11, in which G is, for example, -CH\n2\nC(O)(CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n and where n, p, R\n3\n, and Ar\n4\n are as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNitriles \n4\n are added to a mixture of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and potassium carbonate.

Accordingly, the invention also encompasses 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds and their uses as described herein in the form of their individual stereoisomer or tautomers. In addition, one or more hydrogen, carbon or other atoms of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound can be replaced by an isotope of the hydrogen, carbon or other atoms, respectively. Such compounds, which are encompassed by the present invention, are useful as research and diagnostic tools in metabolic pharmacokinetic studies and in binding assays.\n\n\n \n\n\n4.4 \nTherapeutic Uses of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the invention, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are administered to an animal, in one embodiment a mammal, in another embodiment a human, for use in the treatment or prevention of pain. The 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used to treat or prevent acute or chronic pain. For example, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used for, but are not limited to, treating or preventing cancer pain, central pain, labor pain, myocardial infarction pain, pancreatic pain, colic pain, post operative pain, headache pain, muscle pain, and pain associated with intensive care.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can also be used for inhibiting, preventing, or treating pain associated with inflammation or with an inflammatory disease in an animal. The pain to be inhibited, treated or prevented may be associated with inflammation associated with an inflammatory disease, which can arise where there is an inflammation of the body tissue, and which can be a local inflammatory response and/or a systemic inflammation. For example, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used to inhibit, treat, or prevent pain associated with inflammatory diseases including, but not limited to: organ transplant rejection; reoxygenation injury resulting from organ transplantation (see \nGrupp et al. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 31:297 303 (1999\n)) including, but not limited to, transplantation of the heart, lung, liver, or kidney; chronic inflammatory diseases of the joints, including arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and bone diseases associated with increased bone resorption; inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ileitis, ulcerative colitis, Barrett's syndrome, and Crohn's disease; inflammatory lung diseases, such as asthma, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and chronic obstructive airway disease; inflammatory diseases of the eye, including corneal dystrophy, trachoma, onchocerciasis, uveitis, sympathetic ophthalmitis and endophthalmitis; chronic inflammatory diseases of the gum, including gingivitis and periodontitis; tuberculosis; leprosy; inflammatory diseases of the kidney, including uremic complications, glomerulonephritis and nephrosis; inflammatory diseases of the skin, including sclerodermatitis, psoriasis and eczema; inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, including chronic demyelinating diseases of the nervous system, multiple sclerosis, AIDS-related neurodegeneration and Alzheimer s disease, infectious meningitis, encephalomyelitis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and viral or autoimmune encephalitis; autoimmune diseases, including Type I and Type II diabetes mellitus; diabetic complications, including, but not limited to, diabetic cataract, glaucoma, retinopathy, nephropathy (such as microaluminuria and progressive diabetic nephropathy), polyneuropathy, mononeuropathies, autonomic neuropathy, gangrene of the feet, atherosclerotic coronary arterial disease, peripheral arterial disease, nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar coma, foot ulcers, joint problems, and a skin or mucous membrane complication (such as an infection, a shin spot, a candidal infection or necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum); immune-complex vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); inflammatory diseases of the heart, such as cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease hypercholesterolemia, and atherosclerosis; as well as various other diseases that can have significant inflammatory components, including preeclampsia, chronic liver failure, brain and spinal cord trauma, and cancer. The 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can also be used for inhibiting, treating, or preventing pain associated with inflammatory disease that can, for example, be a systemic inflammation of the body, exemplified by gram-positive or gram negative shock, hemorrhagic or anaphylactic shock, or shock induced by cancer chemotherapy in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, \ne.g.\n, shock associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Such shock can be induced, \ne.g\n., by a chemotherapeutic agent that is adminstered as a treatment for cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are administered to an animal, in one embodiment a mammal, in another embodiment a human, for use in the treatment or prevention of diarrhea. The 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used to treat or prevent acute or chronic diarrhea. For example, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used for, but are not limited to, treating or preventing acute diarrhea caused by a virus, such as but not limited to Norwalk-virus, Norwalk-like virus, Rotavirus, and Cytomegaloviurs: protozoa, such as but not limited to \nGirardia lamlia, Crpytosporidium\n and \nEntamoeba histolytica;\n and bacteria, including but not limited to \nStapylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens,\n enterotoxigenic \nE. coli, Vibrio cholera,\n enterohemmorrhagic \nE\n. \ncoli\n O157:H5, \nVibrio parahaemolyticus, Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella,\n enteroinvasive \nE\n. \ncoli, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Yersinia enterocolitica, Chlamydia, Nisseria gonorrhoeae,\n and \nListeria monocytogenes.\n For example, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used for treating or preventing chronic diarrhea classified as including, but not limited to, osmotic diarrhea, secretory diarrhea, or resulting from an inflammatory condition, a malabsorption syndrome, a motility disorder, and a chronic infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present inventor believes that unlike traditional opioid agonists and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds do not significantly cross the blood-brain barrier. Accordingly, the administration of an effective amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound to an animal should result in fewer side effects, including, for example, respiratory depression, unwanted euphoria, sedation, increased drug tolerance, and increased drug dependence, that can result from the administration of traditional opioid agonists or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. In one embodiment, the administration of an effective amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound to an animal results in none of the aforementioned side effects. Therefore, in certain embodiments, the present uses encompass treating or preventing pain, while reducing or eliminating one or more of the aforementioned side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are agonists for and, accordingly, are capable of stimulating an opioid receptor. In one embodiment, the opiod receptor is a µ receptor. In another embodiment, the opioid receptor is an ORL-1 receptor. In a further embodiment, the opioid receptor is a δ-opioid preceptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to the use in the preparation of medicament for stimulating opioid-receptor function in a cell comprising contacting a cell capable of expressing an opioid receptor with an effective amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound. The use is also useful for stimulating opioid receptor function in a cell \nin vivo\n, in an animal, in one embodiment a human, by contacting a cell capable of expressing an opioid receptor, in an animal, with an effective amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound. In one embodiment, the use is useful for treating or preventing pain or diarrhea in an animal. Brain tissue, spinal chord tissue, immune cells, cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and primary afferent nerve cells are examples of tissues and/or cells that are capable of expressing an opioid receptor. This use can be used \nin vitro,\n for example, as an assay to select cells that express an opioid receptor.\n\n\n \n\n\n4.4.1 \nTherapeutic/Prophylactic Administration and Compositions of the Invention\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDue to their activity, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are advantageously useful in veterinary and human medicine. As described above, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are useful for treating or preventing pain or diarrhea in an animal in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen administered to an animal, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be administered as a component of a pharmaceutical composition that comprises pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The present compositions, which comprise a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound, are in one embodiment administered orally. The compositions of the invention can also be adapted for and administered by any other convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (\ne.g\n., oral mucosa, rectal, and intestinal mucosa, \netc\n.) and can be administered alone or together with another therapeutic agent. Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, \ne.g\n., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules; capsules, \netc\n., and can be used to administer the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of administration include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectal, by inhalation, or topical, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. The mode of administration is left to the discretion of the practitioner. In most instances, administration will result in the release of a therapeutically effective amount of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds into the bloodstream.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn specific embodiments, it may be desirable to administer the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds locally. This may be achieved, for example, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, \ne.g\n., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPulmonary administration can also be employed, \ne.g\n., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent, or via perfusion in a fluorocarbon or synthetic pulmonary surfactant. In certain embodiments, the 4-Oxadiazolyi-piperidine Compounds can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and excipients such as triglycerides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see \nLanger, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n) and \nTreat et al., Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer 317-327 and 353-365 (1989\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be delivered in a controlled-release system (\nsee, e.g.,\n \nGoodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984\n)). Other controlled release systems discussed in the review by \nLanger, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n) may be used. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (\nLanger, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n); \nSefton, CRC Crit. Ref Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987\n);\n Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980\n); and \nSaudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989\n)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (\nsee\n \nMedical Applications of Controlled Release (Langer and Wise eds., 1974\n); \nControlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance (Smolen and Ball eds., 1984\n); \nRanger and Peppas, J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61 (1983\n); \nLevy et al., Science 228:190 (1985\n); \nDuring et al., Ann. Neurol. 25:351 (1989\n); and \nHoward et al., J. Neurosurg. 71:105 (1989\n)). In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of a target of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose. In further embodiments, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be administered by controlled-release means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos.: 3,845,770\n \n; \n \n3,916,899\n \n; \n \n3,536,809\n \n; \n \n3,598,123\n \n; \n \n4,008,719\n \n; \n \n5,674,533\n \n; \n \n5,059,595\n \n; \n \n5,591,767\n \n; \n \n5,120,548\n \n; \n \n5,073,543\n \n; \n \n5,639,476\n \n; \n \n5,354,556\n \n; and \n \n5,733,566\n \n. Such dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds. The invention thus encompasses single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present compositions can optionally comprise a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient so as to provide the form for proper administration to the animal. Such pharmaceutical excipients can be liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. The pharmaceutical excipients can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating, and coloring agents may be used. When administered to an animal, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are preferably sterile. Water is a particularly useful excipient when the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid excipients, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients also include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malts, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The present compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients for intravenous administration of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds include, but are not limited to, normal (about 0.9%) saline, about 25 to about 30% polyethylene glycol (\"PEG\") diluted with saline or water, and about 2 to about 30% hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin diluted with water. In one embodiment, compositions for intravenous administration comprise the compound dissolved in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions may also include a solubilizing agent. Compositions for intravenous administration can optionally include a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to lessen pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water-free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are to be administered by infusion, they can be dispensed, for example, from an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the 4-Oxadiazolyl-pipefidine Compounds are administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients for intraperitoneal administration of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds include, but are not limited to, normal (about 0.9%) saline, about 25 to about 30% PEG diluted with saline or water, about 25 to about 30% propylene glycol (PG) diluted with saline or water, and about 2 to about 30% hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin diluted with water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients for subcutaneous and intramuscular administration of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds include, but are not limited to, water, normal (about 0.9%) saline, about 25 to about 30% PEG diluted with saline or water, and about 25 to about 30% PG diluted with saline or water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients for oral administration of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds include, but are not limited to, water, normal (about 0.9%) saline, about 25 to about 30% polyethylene glycol PEG diluted with saline or water, about 2 to about 30% hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin diluted with water, about 25 to about 30% PG diluted with saline or water, and about 1 to about 5% methylcellulose diluted with water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients for intracerebroventricular and intrathecal administration of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds include, but are not limited to, normal (about 0.9%) saline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained release formulations, suppositories, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the composition is in the form of a capsule (\nsee e.g.,\n \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,698,155\n \n). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical excipients are described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., 19th ed. 1995\n), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a composition adapted for oral administration to an animal, particularly a human being. Compositions for oral delivery may be in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, or elixirs, for example. Orally administered compositions can contain preserving agents, coloring agents, and one or more agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin and flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions can be coated or otherwise formulated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compositions. In these later platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate-release formulations. A time delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate may also be used. Oral compositions can include standard excipients such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose and magnesium carbonate. In one embodiment, such excipients are of pharmaceutical grade.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControlled release pharmaceutical compositions can have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled counterparts. In one embodiment a controlled-release composition comprises a minimal amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled release compositions include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled release compositions can favorably affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound, and can thus reduce the occurrence of adverse side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, controlled release compositions can initially release an amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound that promptly treats or prevents pain or diarrhea, and then gradually and continually release another amount of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. To maintain this constant level of the 4-Oxadiazolyi-piperidine Compound in the body, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound can be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions including, but not limited to, changes in pH, changes in temperature, concentration or availability of enzymes, concentration or availability of water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds that is effective in the treatment or prevention of pain or diarrhea can depend on the nature or severity of the disorder or condition causing the pain and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal effective dosage amounts. The precise dose to be employed can also depend on the intended route of administration, and the degree or severity of the pain or diarrhea and can be determined according to the judgment of the medical practitioner in view of each patient's circumstances and published clinical studies. Suitable effective dosage amounts can range from about 10 micrograms to about 2500 milligrams about every 4 h, although typically about 100 mg or less. In one embodiment, the effective dosage amount ranges from about 0.01 milligrams to about 100 milligrams of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound about every 4 h, in another embodiment about 0.020 milligrams to about 50 milligrams about every 4 h, and in another embodiment about 0.025 milligrams to about 20 milligrams about every 4 h. The dosage amounts described herein refer to total amounts administered; that is, if more than one 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound is administered, the effective dosage amounts correspond to the total amount administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere a cell capable of expressing an opioid receptor is contacted with a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound \nin vitro,\n the effective amount for opioid receptor function stimulation will typically range from about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg/L, in one embodiment from about 0.1 mg to about 50 mg/L, and in another embodiment from about 1 mg to about 20 mg/L, of a solution or suspension of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In one embodiment, the opiod receptor is a µ receptor. In another embodiment, the opiod receptor is an ORL-1 receptor. In a further embodiment, the opioid receptor is a δ-opioid receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere a cell capable of expressing an opioid receptor is contacted with a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound \nin vivo\n, the effective amount for opioid receptor function stimulation will typically range from about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, in one embodiment from about 0.1 mg to about 50 mg/kg body weight per day, and in another embodiment from about I mg to about 20 mg/kg of body weight per day. In one embodiment, the opiod receptor is a µ receptor. In another embodiment, the opiod receptor is an ORL-1 receptor. In a further embodiment, the opioid receptor is a δ-opioid receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be assayed \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo\n for their ability to treat or prevent pain or diarrhea prior to use in humans. Animal model systems can be used to demonstrate the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds' safety or efficacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present methods for treating or preventing pain or diarrhea in an animal can further comprise administering to the animal an effective amount a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound in combination with an effective amount of another therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present methods for stimulating opioid-receptor function in a cell can further comprise contacting the cell with an effective amount of another therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of other therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, an opioid agonist, a non-opioid analgesic, a non-steroid antiinflammatory agent, an antimigraine agent, a Cox-II inhibitor, an antiemetic, a β-adrenergic blocker, an anticonvulsant, an antidepressant, a Ca\n2+\n -channel blocker, an anticancer agent, an anti-anxiety agent, an agent for treating or preventing an addictive disorder and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffective amounts of the other therapeutic agents are well known to those skilled in the art. However, it is well within the skilled artisan's purview to determine the other therapeutic agent's optimal effective-amount range. In one embodiment of the invention, where another therapeutic agent is administered to an animal, the effective amount of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound is less than its effective amount would be where the other therapeutic agent is not administered. In this case, without being bound by theory, it is believed that the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound and the other therapeutic agent act synergistically to treat or prevent pain or diarrhea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of useful opioid agonists include, but are not limited to, alfentanil, allylprodine, alphaprodine, anileridine, benzylmorphine, bezitramide, buprenorphine, butorphanol, clonitazene, codeine, desomorphine, dextromoramide, dezocine, diampromide, diamorphone, dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, dimenoxadol, dimepheptanol, dimethylthiambutene, dioxaphetyl butyrate, dipipanone, eptazocine, ethoheptazine, ethylmethylthiambutene, ethylmorphine, etonitazene fentanyl, heroin, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, hydroxypethidine, isomethadone, ketobemidone, levorphanol, levophenacylmorphan, lofentanil, meperidine, meptazinol, metazocine, methadone, metopon, morphine, myrophine, nalbuphine, narceine, nicomorphine, norlevorphanol, normethadone, nalorphine, normorphine, norpipanone, opium, oxycodone, oxymorphone, papaveretum, pentazocine, phenadoxone, phenomorphan, phenazocine, phenoperidine, piminodine, piritramide, proheptazine, promedol, properidine, propiram, propoxyphene, sufentanil, tilidine, tramadol, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the opioid agonist is selected from codeine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxycodone, dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, morphine, tramadol, oxymorphone, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of useful non-opioid analgesics include non steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, benoxaprofen, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen, flubufen, ketoprofen, indoprofen, piroprofen, carprofen, oxaprozin, pramoprofen, muroprofen, trioxaprofen, suprofen, aminoprofen, tiaprofenic acid, fluprofen, bucloxic acid, indomethacin, sulindac, tolmetin, zomepirac, tiopinac, zidometacin, acemetacin, fentiazac, clidanac, oxpinac, mefenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, flufenamic acid, niflumic acid, tolfenamic acid, diflurisal, flufenisal, piroxicam, sudoxicam, isoxicam, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and mixtures thereof.
