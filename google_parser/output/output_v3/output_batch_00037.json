Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds. Formula I shows the structure of the class of compounds without preferred stereochemistry. The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration. If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art. Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.\n\n\nThere are several acceptable methods of naming the compounds discussed herein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the above compound can be named either as “(3aR,4R,5S,7aR) tert-butyl-5-hydroxy-4-(2-methylphenyl)octahydro-2H-isoindole-2-carboxylate” or “tert-butyl (3aR,4R,5S,7aR)-5-hydroxy-4-phenyloctahydro-2H-isoindole-2-carboxylate”.

This activity can be demonstrated by the following assays.\n\n\nReceptor Expression in COS: To express the cloned human neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) transiently in COS, the cDNA for the human NK1R was cloned into the expression vector pCDM9 which was derived from pCDM8 (INVITROGEN) by inserting the ampicillin resistance gene (nucleotide 1973 to 2964 from BLUESCRIPT SK+) into the Sac II site. Transfection of 20 ug of the plasmid DNA into 10 million COS cells was achieved by electroporation in 800 ul of transfection buffer (135 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1.2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 2.4 mM K\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.6 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4) at 260 V and 950 uF using the IBI GENEZAPPER (1131, New Haven, Conn.). The cells were incubated in 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 90% DMEM media (GIBCO, Grand Island, N.Y.) in 5% CO\n2 \nat 37° C. for three days before the binding assay.\n\n\nStable Expression in CHO: To establish a stable cell line expressing the cloned human NK1R, the cDNA was subcloned into the vector pRcCMV (INVITROGEN). Transfection of 20 ug of the plasmid DNA into CHO cells was achieved by electroporation in 800 ul of transfection buffer supplemented with 0.625 mg/ml Herring sperm DNA at 300 V and 950 uF using the IBI GENEZAPPER (IBI). The transfected cells were incubated in CHO media [10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 1/500 hypoxanthine-thymidine (ATCC), 90% IMDM media (JRH BIOSCIENCES, Lenexa, Kans.), 0.7 mg/ml G418 (GIBCO)] in 5% CO\n2 \nat 37° C. until colonies were visible. Each colony was separated and propagated. The cell clone with the highest number of human NK1R was selected for subsequent applications such as drug screening.\n\n\nAssay Protocol using COS or CHO: The binding assay of human NK1R expressed in either COS or CHO cells is based on the use of \n125\nI-substance P (\n125\nI-SP, from DU PONT, Boston, Mass.) as a radioactively labeled ligand which competes with unlabeled substance P or any other ligand for binding to the human NK1R. Monolayer cell cultures of COS or CHO were dissociated by the non-enzymatic solution (SPECIALTY MEDIA, Lavallette, N.J.) and resuspended in appropriate volume of the binding buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl\n2\n, 150 mM NaCl, 0.04 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.004 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 0.01 mM phosphoramidon) such that 200 ul of the cell suspension would give rise to about 10,000 cpm of specific \n125\nI-SP binding (approximately 50,000 to 200,000 cells). In the binding assay, 200 ul of cells were added to a tube containing 20 ul of 1.5 to 2.5 nM of \n125\nI-SP and 20 ul of unlabeled substance P or any other test compound. The tubes were incubated at 4° C. or at room temperature for 1 hour with gentle shaking. The bound radioactivity was separated from unbound radioactivity by GF/C filter (BRANDEL, Gaithersburg, Md.) which was pre-wetted with 0.1% polyethylenimine. The filter was washed with 3 ml of wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl\n2\n, 150 mM NaCl) three times and its radioactivity was determined by gamma counter. The activation of phospholipase C by NK1R may also be measured in CHO cells expressing the human NK1R by determining the accumulation of inositol monophosphate which is a degradation product of IP\n3\n. CHO cells are seeded in 12-well plate at 250,000 cells per well. After incubating in CHO media for 4 days, cells are loaded with 0.025 uCi/ml of 3H-myoinositol by overnight incubation. The extracellular radioactivity is removed by washing with phosphate buffered saline. LiCl is added to the well at final concentration of 0.1 mM with or without the test compound, and incubation is continued at 37° C. for 15 mM. Substance P is added to the well at final concentration of 0.3 nM to activate the human NK1R. After 30 min of incubation at 37° C., the media is removed and 0.1 N HCl is added. Each well is sonicated at 4° C. and extracted with CHCl\n3\n/methanol (1:1). The aqueous phase is applied to a 1 ml Dowex AG 1×8 ion exchange column. The column is washed with 0.1 N formic acid followed by 0.025 M ammonium formate-0.1 N formic acid. The inositol monophosphate is eluted with 0.2 M ammonium formate-0.1 N formic acid and quantitated by beta counter.\n\n\nIn particular, the intrinsic tachykinin receptor antagonist activities of the compounds of the present invention may be demonstrated by this assay.
