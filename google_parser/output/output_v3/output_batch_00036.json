No. 7,883,700, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/012,329, filed Dec. 7, 2007, both of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe immune system is the body's primary defense against diseases caused by pathogens, namely bacteria, viruses, fungi etc, as well as against diseases caused by abnormal growth of the body's own cells and tissues (i.e. cancerous tumors). Normally, the immune system is able to distinguish between the body's normal cells or “self” and foreign pathogens or abnormal cells or “non-self”. The processes by which the immune system refrains from reacting to one's own body is called tolerance. Sometimes, the immune system loses the ability to recognize “self” as normal and the subsequent response directed against the tissue or cells, results in loss of tolerance, a state of autoimmunity. The pathologies resulting from autoimmunity often have serious clinical consequences and are one of the major health problems in the world, especially in developed nations.\n\n\nIL-21 is a potent immunomodulatory four-α-helical bundle type I cytokine that binds to a heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-21R and the common gamma chain (reviewed by Spolski and Leonard, \nAnnu Rev Immunol. Nov. \n8, 2007). IL-21 is produced by NK-T and CD4+ T cells (including pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and follicular helper T\nFH \ncells that are important for germinal center responses) and has pleiotropic effects on both innate and adaptive immune responses, including enhanced proliferation of B and T cells, increased cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells, and regulation of the Th17 cell lineage (see below). IL-21 can also inhibit the antigen-presentation function of dendritic cells and can induce apoptosis in B cells and NK cells under certain conditions. IL-21 has potent anti-tumor activity, but has also been associated with the development of various autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and psoriasis (reviewed by Spolski and Leonard, \nAnnu Rev Immunol\n. Nov. 8, 2007).\n\n\nIL-21 has been shown to modulate antibody responses by directly acting on B cells. (Mehta et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n170:4111-4118, 2003; Ozaki et al., \nScience, \n298:1630-1634, 2002; Suto et al., \nBlood, \n100:4565-4573, 2002). IL-21 can induce the differentiation of naïve human B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells (Ozaki et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n173:5361, 2004; Ettinger et al., \nJ Immunol. \n175:7867-79, 2005; Ettinger et al, \nJ Immunol. \n178:2872-82, 2007; Kuchen et al. \nJ Immunol. \n179:5886-96, 2007) and to stimulate the production of IgE in human B cell (Kobayashi et al. \nHuman Immunol. doi:\n10:1016/j.humimm.2008.10.) In IL-21 or IL-21R deficient animals, fewer antibody-secreting cells are generated from the germinal center reaction and affinity maturation is reduced (Zotos et al., submitted). Extrafollicular antibody forming cells, which are implicated in autoimmunity, require cognate help from a subset of specialized CD4 T cells that secrete IL-21 (Odegard, et al., \nJEM \n205(12):2873-2886, 2008).\n\n\nGeneration of antibodies against allogenic MHC is a pivotal phenomenon in transplant rejection. Transplant recipients who develop titres of anti-MHC antibodies (highly sensitized transplant patients) are t risk for chronic rejection and are poor candidates for new grafts due to likelihood of antibody mediated rejection of the new transplant (Smith, et al., \nAm J Transplantation \n8: 1-11, 2008). In a rat model of acute renal allograft rejection, IL-21 and IL-21R were uniquely increased in intravascular mononuclear cells of renal allografts but not isografts (Hecker, et al., \nImmunobiology: doi:\n10.1016/\nj.imbio.\n2008.04.004, (2008)). In human cardiac transplants undergoing rejection, expression levels of IL-21 and IL-21R correlate with the ISHLT rejection grade, and highest expression is present in grades 1R and 2R (Baan, et al., \nTransplantation \n83(11): 1485-1492, 2007).\n\n\nIn graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), the anti-allo response is mediated by uncontrolled activation of T lymphocytes from the graft, which direct an inflammatory response against host tissues. Regulatory T cells (Treg) can modulate this response in animal models. IL-21 has been shown to counteract the regulatory functions of Treg (Clough et al., \nJ Immunol \n180: 5395-5401, 2008). In mouse models of GVHD, transfer of IL-21 deficient T cells resulted in significantly reduced clinical signs and histological scores and increased survival, compared with WT T cells. Decreased frequency of IFN-gamma secreting T cells and increased Tregs were observed in the colon mucosa. IL-21 blockade using anti-mIL-21 mAb and WT T cell transfer produced similar results (Bucher et al., \nBlood \n(ASH Annual Meeting Abstracts) 2008 112: Abstract #2342).\n\n\nIt has also recently been shown that IL-21 is both produced by and required for the differentiation of mouse pro-inflammatory Th17 cells (Korn et al. \nNature. \n448:484-487, 2007; Nurieva et al. \nNature \n448:480-483, 2007; Zhou et al., \nNat Immunol. \n8:967-974, 2007; Wei et al. \nJ Biol Chem. \n282:34605-34610, 2007). Human Th17 cells also produce IL-21 and studies are ongoing to determine whether IL-21 acts as an autocrine factor for human Th17 cells, as it does for mouse Th17 cells. Ozaki et al. (\nJ. Immunol. \n173:5361, 2004) demonstrated that IL-21 expression is elevated in lupus-prone BXSB-Yaa mice, a model for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), at an age when the early characteristics of autoimmune processes first become evident. Treatment of these BXSB-Yaa mice with a soluble mouse IL-21 receptor (mIL-21R-Fc) partially inhibits various disease parameters, including glomerulonephritis (Bubier et al., \nAnn N Y Acad Sci. \n1110:590-601, 2007). Treatment with mIL-21R-Fc has also been shown to be efficacious in another pre-clinical disease model of SLE, the MRL/lpr mouse (Herber et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n178: 3822-3830, 2007), as well as in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model of rheumatoid arthritis (Young et al., \nArthr Rheum \n56:1152-1163, 2007). Preliminary human data also suggest dysregulation of IL-21 and IL-21R in SLE (Mitoma et al. \nInt J Mol Med. \n16:609-615, 2005; Wang et al., \nChinese J. Cell. Mol. Immunol. \n23(11):1041-1042, 2007; Sawalha et al. \nAnn Rheum Dis \n67: 458-461, 2008). More recently, Rus et al. data obtained from 24 SLE patients and 15 healthy controls (Nguyen et al., ACR/ARHP Scientific Meeting, 1760/482, 2008 Oct. 24-29 San Francisco, Calif.). Rus et al. showed that 1) IL-21 mRNA expression is significantly increased in CD4+ T cells from lupus patients compared to controls, 2) IL-21 levels are significantly elevated in sera from patients with active compared to inactive SLE or controls, 3) IL-21 enhances CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells proliferation in patients and controls in a dose dependent fashion, 4) IL-21 enhances anti-CD40 induced plasma cell differentiation in normal controls and SLE patients, and 5) elevated levels of IL-21 may contribute to proliferation of autoreactive CD4+ T cells and plasma cell differentiation in SLE.\n\n\nMonteleone et al have demonstrated that IL-21 RNA and protein expression is increased in inflamed but not uninflamed tissue from Crohn's disease (CD) (and, to a lesser degree, ulcerative colitis) patients and that IL-21 production by CD3+ cells from lamina propria mononuclear cells from CD patients is also enhanced (Monteleone et al. \nGastroenterology \n128:687-694, 2005; Monteleone et al. \nGut \n55:1774-1780, 2006; Peluso et al., \nJ Immunol \n178:732-739, 2007). These authors suggested that IL-21 regulates experimental colitis by modulating the balance between regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th17 cells (Fantini et al. \nEur. J. Immunol. \n37:3155-3163, 2007). Inhibition of IL-21 in vivo with a soluble IL-21 receptor in either mouse or rat models of colitis leads to significant reductions in clinical signs of colitis (Young et al. US 2006/0039902).\n\n\nThe IL-21 receptor is expressed by NK cells, and NK cells have been shown to be responsive to treatment with IL-21 both in vivo and in vitro. In oncology patients treated with recombinant human IL-21, altered recirculation patterns in lymphocyte subsets including NK cells, and increased expression of markers of NK cell activation and cytolytic effector capacity were observed (Frederiksen, et al., \nCancer Immunol Immunother \n57(10): 1439-1449, 2008). In autoimmune diseases, NK cell activity may play a role in promoting inflammation and associated tissue damage. Tissue homing of NK cells is directed by chemoattractants released at the site of inflammation (Morris and Ley, \nCurr Mol Med.; \n4(4):431-8, 2004). Lamina propria NK cells from patients with Crohn's Disease released greater quantities of IFN-γ and TNF-α when stimulated in vitro with IL-21 and IgG, compared with LPNK cells from controls (Liu and Jiu, \nChronic Inflammation of Liver and Gut, Falk Symposium abst. No. \n163, 2008 Mar. 14-15). NK cells are also reported to regulate autoimmunity and transplant rejection through their interactions with dendritic cells (DC), by killing immature or activated DC, and by releasing cytokines that affect the activation state and antigen presentation functions of the DC (Vivier et al., \nNat Immunol \n9(5):503-510, 2008; Laffont et al., \nBlood \n112:661-671, 2008). A comparison of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from tolerant and non-tolerant liver allograft recipients showed changes in the transcriptional program of NK cells (Martinez-Llordella et al., \nJ Clin Invest \n118(8):2845-2857, 2008). Thus, blockade of IL-21 may modulate the activation status of NK cells, reduce their contribution to tissue inflammation in autoimmune diseases, and alter the clinical course of transplant rejection. NK cells are also reported to regulate autoimmunity and transplant rejection through their interactions with dendritic cells (DC), by killing immature or activated DC and by releasing cytokines that affect the activation state and alter antigen presentation functions of the DC. Thus, blockade of IL-21 may modulate the activation of NK cells and reduce their contribution to tissue inflammation in autoimmune diseases.\n\n\nThe present invention provides anti-human IL-21 monoclonal antibodies and methods of using those antibodies that inhibit the symptoms and biological activities that manifest as autoimmune and inflammatory disorders and are associated with IL-21/IL-21 receptor interactions.\n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n is an alignment based on the Kabat numbering system of amino acid residues comprising the variable heavy chain regions of antibodies designated by clone numbers 362.78.1.44 (78), 362.597.3 (597), 362.75.1.1 (75), 366.552.11 (552), 366.328.10 (328) and correspond with SEQ ID NO: 29, SEQ ID NO: 45, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 77 and SEQ ID NO: 61, respectively.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n is an alignment based on the Kabat numbering system of amino residues comprising the variable light chain region of antibodies designated by clone numbers 362.78.1.44 (78), 362.597.3 (597), 362.75.1.1 (75), 366.552.11 (552), 366.328.10 (328), and correspond with SEQ ID NO: 37, SEQ ID NO: 53, SEQ ID NO: 21, SEQ ID NO: 85 and SEQ ID NO: 69, respectively.\n\n\n \nFIG. 3\n illustrates MALDI/TOF mass spectra of IL-21 peptide sequence regions obtained from IL-21 alone and the IL-21 immune complex.

inventions described herein.\n\n\nThe terms “amino-terminal” and “carboxyl-terminal” are used herein to denote positions within polypeptides. Where the context allows, these terms are used with reference to a particular sequence or portion of a polypeptide to denote proximity or relative position. For example, a certain sequence positioned carboxyl-terminal to a reference sequence within a polypeptide is located proximal to the carboxyl terminus of the reference sequence, but is not necessarily at the carboxyl terminus of the complete polypeptide.\n\n\nThe term “antagonist” refers to any compound including a protein, polypeptide, peptide, antibody, antibody fragment, large molecule, or small molecule (less than 10 kD), that decreases the activity, activation or function of another molecule. IL-21 antagonists cause at least one of the following: decreased immune function of NK cells, dendritic cells, T cell subsets and B cell subsets; bind IL-21 such that the interaction of IL-21 protein with its receptor is blocked, inhibited, reduced or neutralized.\n\n\n“Antibodies” (Abs) and “immunoglobulins” (Igs) are glycoproteins having the same structural characteristics. While antibodies exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen, immunoglobulins include both antibodies and other antibody-like molecules that lack antigen specificity. Polypeptides of the latter kind are, for example, produced at low levels by the lymph system and at increased levels by myelomas. Thus, as used herein, the term “antibody” or “antibody peptide(s)” refers to an intact antibody, or a binding fragment thereof that competes with the intact antibody for specific binding and includes chimeric, humanized, fully human, and bispecific antibodies. In certain embodiments, binding fragments are produced by recombinant DNA techniques. In additional embodiments, binding fragments are produced by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Binding fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv, and single-chain antibodies, ScFv. “Native antibodies and immunoglobulins” are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide-linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light- and heavy-chain variable domains (Chothia et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n186:651 (1985); Novotny and Haber, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n82:4592 (1985)).\n\n\nThe term “chimeric antibody” or “chimeric antibodies” refers to antibodies whose light and heavy chain genes have been constructed, typically by genetic engineering, from immunoglobulin variable and constant region genes belonging to different species. For example, the variable segments of the genes from a mouse monoclonal antibody may be joined to human constant segments, such as \ngamma\n 1 and \ngamma\n 3. A typical therapeutic chimeric antibody is thus a hybrid protein composed of the variable or antigen-binding domain from a mouse antibody and the constant domain from a human antibody, although other mammalian species may be used. Specifically, a chimeric antibody is produced by recombinant DNA technology in which all or part of the hinge and constant regions of an immunoglobulin light chain, heavy chain, or both, have been substituted for the corresponding regions from another animal's immunoglobulin light chain or heavy chain. In this way, the antigen-binding portion of the parent monoclonal antibody is grafted onto the backbone of another species' antibody.\n\n\nThe term “epitope” refers to any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. More specifically, the term “IL-21 epitope” as used herein refers to a portion of the IL-21 polypeptide having antigenic or immunogenic activity in an animal, preferably in a mammal, and most preferably in a mouse or a human. An epitope having immunogenic activity is a portion of a IL-21 polypeptide that elicits an antibody response in an animal. An epitope having antigenic activity is a portion of a IL-21 polypeptide to which an antibody immunospecifically binds as determined by any method well known in the art, for example, by immunoassays. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic. “Discontinuous epitopes” are conformational epitopes formed from at least two separate regions in the primary sequence of the IL-21 protein. Conformational epitopes lose the ability to specifically bind in the presence of denaturing solvents (e.g. in western blot analyses).\n\n\nAn “antigen-binding site of an antibody” is that portion of an antibody that is sufficient to bind to its antigen. The minimum such region is typically a variable domain or a genetically engineered variant thereof. Single-domain binding sites can be generated from camelid antibodies (see Muyldermans and Lauwereys, \nJ. Mol. Recog. \n12:131-140, 1999; Nguyen et al., \nEMBO J. \n19:921-930, 2000) or from V\nH \ndomains of other species to produce single-domain antibodies (“dAbs”; see Ward et al., \nNature \n341:544-546, 1989; U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,516 to Winter et al.). In certain variations, an antigen-binding site is a polypeptide region having only 2 complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of a naturally or non-naturally (e.g., mutagenized) occurring heavy chain variable domain or light chain variable domain, or combination thereof (see, e.g., Pessi et al., \nNature \n362:367-369, 1993; Qiu et al., \nNature Biotechnol. \n25:921-929, 2007). More commonly, an antigen-binding site of an antibody comprises both a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain that bind to a common epitope. Within the present invention a molecule that “comprises an antigen-binding site of an antibody” may further comprise one or more of a second antigen-binding site of an antibody (which may bind to the same or a different epitope or to the same or a different antigen), a peptide linker, an immunoglobulin constant domain an immunoglobulin hinge, an amphipathic helix (see Pack and Pluckthun, \nBiochem. \n31:1579-1584, 1992), a non-peptide linker, an oligonucleotide (see Chaudri et al., \nFEBS Letters \n450:23-26, 1999), and the like, and may be a monomeric or multimeric protein. Examples of molecules comprising an antigen-binding site of an antibody are known in the art and include, for example, Fv fragments, single-chain Fv fragments (scFv), Fab fragments, diabodies, minibodies, Fab-scFv fusions, bispecific (scFv)\n4\n-IgG, and bispecific (scFv)\n2\n-Fab. (See, e.g., Hu et al., \nCancer Res. \n56:3055-3061, 1996; Atwell et al., \nMolecular Immunology \n33:1301-1312, 1996; Carter and Merchant, \nCurr. Opin. Biotechnol. \n8:449-454, 1997; Zuo et al., \nProtein Engineering \n13:361-367, 2000; and Lu et al., \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n267:213-226, 2002.)\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “immunoglobulin” refers to a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin gene(s). One form of immunoglobulin constitutes the basic structural unit of an antibody. This form is a tetramer and consists of two identical pairs of immunoglobulin chains, each pair having one light and one heavy chain. In each pair, the light and heavy chain variable regions are together responsible for binding to an antigen, and the constant regions are responsible for the antibody effector functions. Immunoglobulins typically function as antibodies in a vertebrate organism. Five classes of immunoglobulin protein (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE) have been identified in higher vertebrates. IgG comprises the major class; it normally exists as the second most abundant protein found in plasma. In humans, IgG consists of four subclasses, designated IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. The heavy chain constant regions of the IgG class are identified with the Greek symbol γ. For example, immunoglobulins of the IgG1 subclass contain a γ1 heavy chain constant region. Each immunoglobulin heavy chain possesses a constant region that consists of constant region protein domains (\nC\n \n \n \nH\n1, hinge, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2, and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3; IgG3 also contains a C\nH\n4 domain) that are essentially invariant for a given subclass in a species. DNA sequences encoding human and non-human immunoglobulin chains are known in the art. (See, e.g., Ellison et al., \nDNA \n1:11-18, 1981; Ellison et al., \nNucleic Acids Res. \n10:4071-4079, 1982; Kenten et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA \n79:6661-6665, 1982; Seno et al., \nNuc. Acids Res. \n11:719-726, 1983; Riechmann et al., \nNature \n332:323-327, 1988; Amster et al., \nNuc. Acids Res. \n8:2055-2065, 1980; Rusconi and Kohler, \nNature \n314:330-334, 1985; Boss et al., \nNuc. Acids Res. \n12:3791-3806, 1984; Bothwell et al., \nNature \n298:380-382, 1982; van der Loo et al., \nImmunogenetics \n42:333-341, 1995; Karlin et al., \nJ. Mol. Evol. \n22:195-208, 1985; Kindsvogel et al., \nDNA \n1:335-343, 1982; Breiner et al., \nGene \n18:165-174, 1982; Kondo et al., \nEur. J. Immunol. \n23:245-249, 1993; and GenBank Accession No. J00228.) For a review of immunoglobulin structure and function see Putnam, \nThe Plasma Proteins\n, Vol V, Academic Press, Inc., 49-140, 1987; and Padlan, \nMol. Immunol. \n31:169-217, 1994. The term “immunoglobulin” is used herein for its common meaning, denoting an intact antibody, its component chains, or fragments of chains, depending on the context.\n\n\nFull-length immunoglobulin “light chains” (about 25 Kd or 214 amino acids) are encoded by a variable region gene at the NH\n2\n-terminus (encoding about 110 amino acids) and a by a kappa or lambda constant region gene at the COOH-terminus. Full-length immunoglobulin “heavy chains” (about 50 Kd or 446 amino acids) are encoded by a variable region gene (encoding about 116 amino acids) and a gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon constant region gene (encoding about 330 amino acids), the latter defining the antibody's isotype as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, or IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a “J” region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a “D” region of about 10 more amino acids. (See generally Fundamental Immunology (Paul, ed., Raven Press, N.Y., 2nd ed. 1989), Ch. 7).\n\n\nAn immunoglobulin “Fv” fragment contains a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) and a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n), which are held together by non-covalent interactions. An immunoglobulin Fv fragment thus contains a single antigen-binding site. The dimeric structure of an Fv fragment can be further stabilized by the introduction of a disulfide bond via mutagenesis. (See Almog et al., \nProteins \n31:128-138, 1998.)\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms “single-chain Fv” and “single-chain antibody” refer to antibody fragments that comprise, within a single polypeptide chain, the variable regions from both heavy and light chains, but lack constant regions. In general, a single-chain antibody further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains, which enables it to form the desired structure that allows for antigen binding. Single-chain antibodies are discussed in detail by, for example, Pluckthun in \nThe Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies\n, vol. 113 (Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, 1994), pp. 269-315. (See also WIPO Publication WO 88/01649; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,260,203; Bird et al., \nScience \n242:423-426, 1988.) Single-chain antibodies can also be bi-specific and/or humanized.\n\n\nA “Fab fragment” contains one light chain and the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and variable regions of one heavy chain. The heavy chain of a Fab fragment cannot form a disulfide bond with another heavy chain molecule.\n\n\nA “Fab′ fragment” contains one light chain and one heavy chain that contains more of the constant region, between the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between two heavy chains to form a F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecule.\n\n\nA “F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment” contains two light chains and two heavy chains containing a portion of the constant region between the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond is formed between two heavy chains.\n\n\nAn immunoglobulin “Fc fragment” (or Fc domain) is the portion of an antibody that is responsible for binding to antibody receptors on cells and the C1q component of complement. Fc stands for “fragment crystalline,” the fragment of an antibody that will readily form a protein crystal. Distinct protein fragments, which were originally described by proteolytic digestion, can define the overall general structure of an immunoglobulin protein. As originally defined in the literature, the Fc fragment consists of the disulfide-linked heavy chain hinge regions, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2, and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains. However, more recently the term has been applied to a single chain consisting of \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2, and at least a portion of the hinge sufficient to form a disulfide-linked dimer with a second such chain. For a review of immunoglobulin structure and function, see Putnam, \nThe Plasma Proteins\n, Vol. V (Academic Press, Inc., 1987), pp. 49-140; and Padlan, \nMol. Immunol. \n31:169-217, 1994. As used herein, the term Fc includes variants of naturally occurring sequences.\n\n\nAn immunoglobulin light or heavy chain variable region consists of a “framework” region interrupted by three hypervariable regions. Thus, the term “hypervariable region” refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody that are responsible for antigen binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a “Complementarity Determining Region” or “CDR” (e.g., in human, residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2), and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and residues 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain (amino acid sequence numbers based on the EU index; see Kabat et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)) and/or those residues from a “hypervariable loop” (in human, residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196: 901-917, 1987) (both of which are incorporated herein by reference). “Framework Region” or “FR” residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined. The sequences of the framework regions of different light or heavy chains are relatively conserved within a species. Thus, a “human framework region” is a framework region that is substantially identical (about 85% or more, usually 90-95% or more) to the framework region of a naturally occurring human immunoglobulin. The framework region of an antibody, that is the combined framework regions of the constituent light and heavy chains, serves to position and align the CDR's. The CDR's are primarily responsible for binding to an epitope of an antigen. CDRs L1, L2, and L3 of the V\nL \ndomain are also referred to herein, respectively, as LCDR1, LCDR2, and LCDR3; CDRs H1, H2, and H3 of the V\nH \ndomain are also referred to herein, respectively, as HCDR1, HCDR2, and HCDR3.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “human antibody” includes an antibody that has an amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and includes antibodies isolated from human immunoglobulin libraries or from animals transgenic for one or more human immunoglobulin genes and that do not express endogenous immunoglobulins, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,598 to Kucherlapati et al.\n\n\nThe term “humanized immunoglobulin” refers to an immunoglobulin comprising a human framework region and one or more CDR's from a non-human (e.g., a mouse or rat) immunoglobulin. The non-human immunoglobulin providing the CDR's is called the “donor” and the human immunoglobulin providing the framework is called the “acceptor.” Constant regions need not be present, but if they are, they must be substantially identical to human immunoglobulin constant regions, i.e., at least about 85-90%, preferably about 95% or more identical. Hence, all parts of a humanized immunoglobulin, except possibly the CDR's, are substantially identical to corresponding parts of natural human immunoglobulin sequences. In some instances, humanized antibodies may retain non-human residues within the human variable region framework domains to enhance proper binding characteristics (e.g., mutations in the frameworks may be required to preserve binding affinity when an antibody is humanized). A “humanized antibody” is an antibody comprising a humanized light chain and a humanized heavy chain immunoglobulin. For example, a humanized antibody would not encompass a typical chimeric antibody as defined above because, e.g., the entire variable region of a chimeric antibody is non-human.\n\n\nA “bispecific” or “bifunctional” antibody is a hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies may be produced by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab′ fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai & Lachmann, \nClin. Exp. Immunol. \n79:315-321, 1990; Kostelny et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n148:1547-1553, 1992.\n\n\nA “bivalent antibody” other than a “multispecific” or “multifunctional” antibody, in certain embodiments, is an antibody comprising two binding sites having identical antigenic specificity.\n\n\nThe term “diabodies” refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) connected to a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) in the same polypeptide chain (V\nH\n-V\nL\n). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Hollinger et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA \n90:6444-6448, 1993.\n\n\nThe term “minibody” refers herein to a polypeptide that encodes only 2 complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of a naturally or non-naturally (e.g., mutagenized) occurring heavy chain variable domain or light chain variable domain, or combination thereof. Examples of minibodies are described by, e.g., Pessi et al., \nNature \n362:367-369, 1993; and Qiu et al., \nNature Biotechnol. \n25:921-929, 2007.\n\n\nThe term “linear antibodies” refers to the antibodies described in Zapata et al., \nProtein Eng. \n8:1057-1062, 1995. Briefly, these antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (V\nH\n-C\nH1\n-V\nH\n-C\nH1\n) which form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific.\n\n\nThe term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term “monoclonal antibody” refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced.\n\n\nThe term “parent antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody which is encoded by an amino acid sequence used for the preparation of the variant. Preferably, the parent antibody has a human framework region and, if present, has human antibody constant region(s). For example, the parent antibody may be a humanized or human antibody.\n\n\nA “variant” anti-IL-21 or antibody to a second antigen related to autoimmune disease, refers herein to a molecule which differs in amino acid sequence from a “parent” antibody amino acid sequence by virtue of addition, deletion and/or substitution of one or more amino acid residue(s) in the parent antibody sequence. In the preferred embodiment, the variant comprises one or more amino acid substitution(s) in one or more hypervariable region(s) of the parent antibody. For example, the variant may comprise at least one, e.g., from about one to about ten, and preferably from about two to about five, substitutions in one or more hypervariable regions of the parent antibody. Ordinarily, the variant will have an amino acid sequence having at least 75% amino acid sequence identity with the parent antibody heavy or light chain variable domain sequences, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or homology with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical with the parent antibody residues, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or homology. The variant retains the ability to bind the target antigen and preferably has properties which are superior to those of the parent antibody. For example, the variant may have a stronger binding affinity, enhanced ability to inhibit antigen biological activity. To analyze such properties, one should compare a Fab form of the variant to a Fab form of the parent antibody or a full length form of the variant to a full length form of the parent antibody, for example, since it has been found that the format of an antibody impacts its activity in the biological activity assays disclosed herein. The variant antibody of particular interest herein is one which displays about at least a 3 fold, 5 fold, 10 fold, 20 fold, or 50 fold, enhancement in biological activity when compared to the parent antibody.\n\n\nTwo amino acid sequences have “100% amino acid sequence identity” if the amino acid residues of the two amino acid sequences are the same when aligned for maximal correspondence. Similarly, two nucleotide sequences have “100% nucleotide sequence identity” if the nucleotide residues of the two nucleotide sequences are the same when aligned for maximal correspondence. Sequence comparisons can be performed using standard software programs such as those included in the LASERGENE bioinformatics computing suite, which is produced by DNASTAR (Madison, Wis.). Other methods for comparing two nucleotide or amino acid sequences by determining optimal alignment are well-known to those of skill in the art. (See, e.g., Peruski and Peruski, \nThe Internet and the New Biology: Tools for Genomic and Molecular Research \n(ASM Press, Inc. 1997); Wu et al. (eds.), “Information Superhighway and Computer Databases of Nucleic Acids and Proteins,” in \nMethods in Gene Biotechnology \n123-151 (CRC Press, Inc. 1997); Bishop (ed.), \nGuide to Human Genome Computing \n(2nd ed., Academic Press, Inc. 1998).) Two nucleotide or amino acid sequences are considered to have “substantially similar sequence identity” or “substantial sequence identity” if the two sequences have at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95% sequence identity relative to each other.\n\n\nPercent sequence identity is determined by conventional methods. See, e.g., Altschul et al., \nBull. Math. Bio. \n48:603, 1986, and Henikoff and Henikoff, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n89:10915, 1992. For example, two amino acid sequences can be aligned to optimize the alignment scores using a gap opening penalty of 10, a gap extension penalty of 1, and the “BLOSUM62” scoring matrix of Henikoff and Henikoff, supra, as shown in Table 1 (amino acids are indicated by the standard one-letter codes). The percent identity is then calculated as: ([Total number of identical matches]/[length of the longer sequence plus the number of gaps introduced into the longer sequence in order to align the two sequences])(100).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBLOSUM62 Scoring Matrix\n \n \n \n \n \nA\n \nR\n \nN\n \nD\n \nC\n \nQ\n \nE\n \nG\n \nH\n \nI\n \nL\n \nK\n \nM\n \nF\n \nP\n \nS\n \nT\n \nW\n \nY\n \nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\n \n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nR\n \n−1\n \n5\n \n \n \nN\n \n−2\n \n0\n \n6\n \n \n \nD\n \n−2\n \n−2\n \n1\n \n6\n \n \n \nC\n \n0\n \n−3\n \n−3\n \n−3\n \n9\n \n \n \nQ\n \n−1\n \n1\n \n0\n \n0\n \n−3\n \n5\n \n \n \nE\n \n−1\n \n0\n \n0\n \n2\n \n−4\n \n2\n \n5\n \n \n \nG\n \n0\n \n−2\n \n0\n \n−1\n \n−3\n \n−2\n \n−2\n \n6\n \n \n \nH\n \n−2\n \n0\n \n1\n \n−1\n \n−3\n \n0\n \n0\n \n−2\n \n8\n \n \n \nI\n \n−1\n \n−3\n \n−3\n \n−3\n \n−1\n \n−3\n \n−3\n \n−4\n \n−3\n \n4\n \n \n \nL\n \n−1\n \n−2\n \n−3\n \n−4\n \n−1\n \n−2\n \n−3\n \n−4\n \n−3\n \n2\n \n4\n \n \n \nK\n \n−1\n \n2\n \n0\n \n−1\n \n−3\n \n1\n \n1\n \n−2\n \n−1\n \n−3\n \n−2\n \n5\n \n \n \nM\n \n−1\n \n−1\n \n−2\n \n−3\n \n−1\n \n0\n \n−2\n \n−3\n \n−2\n \n1\n \n2\n \n−1\n \n5\n \n \n \nF\n \n−2\n \n−3\n \n−3\n \n−3\n \n−2\n \n−3\n \n−3\n \n−3\n \n−1\n \n0\n \n0\n \n−3\n \n0\n \n6\n \n \n \nP\n \n−1\n \n−2\n \n−2\n \n−1\n \n−3\n \n−1\n \n−1\n \n−2\n \n−2\n \n−3\n \n−3\n \n−1\n \n−2\n \n−4\n \n7\n \n \n \nS\n \n1\n \n−1\n \n1\n \n0\n \n−1\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n−1\n \n−2\n \n−2\n \n0\n \n−1\n \n−2\n \n−1\n \n4\n \n \n \nT\n \n0\n \n−1\n \n0\n \n−1\n \n−1\n \n−1\n \n−1\n \n−2\n \n−2\n \n−1\n \n−1\n \n−1\n \n−1\n \n−2\n \n−1\n \n1\n \n5\n \n \n \nW\n \n−3\n \n−3\n \n−4\n \n−4\n \n−2\n \n−2\n \n−3\n \n−2\n \n−2\n \n−3\n \n−2\n \n−3\n \n−1\n \n1\n \n−4\n \n−3\n \n−2\n \n11\n \n \n \nY\n \n−2\n \n−2\n \n−2\n \n−3\n \n−2\n \n−1\n \n−2\n \n−3\n \n2\n \n−1\n \n−1\n \n−2\n \n−1\n \n3\n \n−3\n \n−2\n \n−2\n \n2\n \n7\n \n \n \nV\n \n0\n \n−3\n \n−3\n \n−3\n \n−1\n \n−2\n \n−2\n \n−3\n \n−3\n \n3\n \n1\n \n−2\n \n1\n \n−1\n \n−2\n \n−2\n \n0\n \n−3\n \n−1\n \n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThose skilled in the art appreciate that there are many established algorithms available to align two amino acid sequences. The “FASTA” similarity search algorithm of Pearson and Lipman is a suitable protein alignment method for examining the level of identity shared by an amino acid sequence disclosed herein and a second amino acid sequence. The FASTA algorithm is described by Pearson and Lipman, Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444, 1988, and by Pearson, Meth. Enzymol. 183:63, 1990. Briefly, FASTA first characterizes sequence similarity by identifying regions shared by the query sequence and a test sequence that have either the highest density of identities (if the ktup variable is 1) or pairs of identities (if ktup=2), without considering conservative amino acid substitutions, insertions, or deletions. The ten regions with the highest density of identities are then rescored by comparing the similarity of all paired amino acids using an amino acid substitution matrix, and the ends of the regions are “trimmed” to include only those residues that contribute to the highest score. If there are several regions with scores greater than the “cutoff” value (calculated by a predetermined formula based upon the length of the sequence and the ktup value), then the trimmed initial regions are examined to determine whether the regions can be joined to form an approximate alignment with gaps. Finally, the highest scoring regions of the two amino acid sequences are aligned using a modification of the Needleman-Wunsch-Sellers algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:444, 1970; Sellers, SIAM J. Appl. Math 26:787, 1974), which allows for amino acid insertions and deletions. Illustrative parameters for FASTA analysis are: ktup=1, gap opening penalty=10, gap extension penalty=1, and substitution matrix=BLOSUM62. These parameters can be introduced into a FASTA program by modifying the scoring matrix file (“SMATRIX”), as explained in \nAppendix\n 2 of Pearson, Meth. Enzymol. 183:63, 1990.\n\n\n\nFASTA can also be used to determine the sequence identity of nucleic acid molecules using a ratio as disclosed above. For nucleotide sequence comparisons, the ktup value can range between one to six, preferably from three to six, most preferably three, with other parameters set as described above.\n\n\nFASTA can also be used to determine the sequence identity of nucleic acid molecules using a ratio as disclosed above. For nucleotide sequence comparisons, the ktup value can range between one to six, preferably from three to six, most preferably three, with other parameters set as described above.\n\n\nOther than percent homology, variant antibodies can also be described the number of amino acid changes from the sequences which are disclosed herein. For example, for full length heavy or light variable chains, the presention invention contemplates 20 or fewer conservative amino acid substitutions from the amino acids described. Additionally, CDRs can vary from the sequences disclosed therein depending on the particular CDR at issue. For example, CDR-1 from either a light or heavy chain can very by four or fewer amino acid substitutions. CDR-2, from either a light or heavy chain variable region can vary by two or fewer amino acid substitutions. CDR-3, from either a light or heavy chain variable region can vary by four or fewer amino acid substitutions. Finally, the framework portion of the light or heavy chains can vary by five or fewer amino acid substitutions and remain within the presently contemplated invention. It should be noted that antibodies that comprises such amino acid changes would retain their ability to bind to the designated antigen, i.e., IL-21 or the second antigen involved in autoimmune disease.\n\n\nThe term “synergistic” is used herein to denote a biological or clinical activity of two or more therapeutic agents that when measured is at least greater than either agent alone.\n\n\nThe presently described antibodies are named according to the following numeric convention: a three digit fusion number, a two digit master well number, followed by one or more single or double digit cloning round designations. Each of these numbers are separated by a period. Thus, antibody “378.78.1” indicates it is from fusion 378, mater well 78, cloning \nround\n 1. It is anticipated that antibodies derived from the same fusion and master well but various cloning rounds will be essentially identical to each other. Thus, antibody 378.78.1 and antibody 378.78.1.44, although from different cloning rounds, would be expected to be the same molecule.\n\n\nThe present invention provides monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments that specifically bind to IL-21 proteins and polypeptides. Human and mouse IL-21 polypeptides, proteins and polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides are disclosed in Parrish-Novak et al., \nNature \n408:57-63, 2003; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,307,024 and 6,686,178; and 7,250,274. Described herein are structural and functional characteristics defining regions (epitopes) of the human IL-21 protein that have been identified as targets for a therapeutic monoclonal antibody. Exemplary human anti-human IL-21 monoclonal antibodies are presented. Certain of these antibodies have the ability to bind native human IL-21, recombinant wildtype human IL-21, a recombinant mutant IL-21 protein and/or peptide regions of human IL-21.\n\n\nThe present invention provides anti-IL-21 antibodies which are useful in therapeutic treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. For example, anti-IL-21 antibodies are useful in the treatment of psoriasis, pancreatitis, type I diabetes (IDDM), Graves' Disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, reactive arthritis, enteropathic arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, autoimmune myocarditis, Kawasaki disease, celiac disease, uveitis, Behcet's disease, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, inflammatory muscle disease (polymyositis, dermatomyositis), microscopic polyangiitis, autoimmune aplastic anemia, autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wegener's syndrome, diverticulosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, scleroderma, systemic sclerosis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, graft vs. host disease (GVHD), cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), Sjogren's syndrome, glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, autoimmune nephritis, pemphigus vulgaris, myasthenia gravis, autoimmune hearing loss, neuromyelitis optica, Goodpasture's syndrome, cryoglobulinemia, Guillain Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), transplant rejection, highly sensitized transplant patients, anti-phospholipid syndrome, allergy, and asthma, and other autoimmune diseases, or other diseases mediated by IL-21 and IL-21 receptor agonists.\n\n\nFive classes of immunoglobulin, IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE, have been identified in higher vertebrates. IgG, IgD, and IgE proteins are characteristically disulfide linked heterotetramers consisting of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. Typically, IgM is found as a pentamer of a tetramer, whereas IgA occurs as a dimer of a tetramer. Modifications can be introduced in the immunoglobulin moiety.\n\n\nIgG comprises the major class as it normally exists as the second most abundant protein found in plasma. In humans, IgG consists of four subclasses, designated IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. Each immunoglobulin heavy chain possesses a constant region that consists of constant region protein domains (\nC\n \n \n \nH\n1, hinge, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2, and C\nH\n3) that are invariant for a given subclass. The heavy chain constant regions of the IgG class are identified with the Greek symbol γ. For example, immunoglobulins of the IgG1 subclass contain a γ1 heavy chain constant region.\n\n\nThe Fc fragment, or Fc domain, consists of the disulfide linked heavy chain hinge regions, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2, and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains. In immunoglobulin fusion proteins, Fc domains of the IgG1 subclass are often used as the immunoglobulin moiety, because IgG1 has the longest serum half-life of any of the serum proteins. Lengthy serum half-life can be a desirable protein characteristic for animal studies and potential human therapeutic use. In addition, the IgG1 subclass possesses the strongest ability to carry out antibody mediated effector functions. The primary effector function that may be most useful in an immunoglobulin fusion protein is the ability for an IgG1 antibody to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. On the other hand, this could be an undesirable function for a fusion protein that functions primarily as an antagonist. Several of the specific amino acid residues that are important for antibody constant region-mediated activity in the IgG1 subclass have been identified. Inclusion or exclusion of these specific amino acids therefore allows for inclusion or exclusion of specific immunoglobulin constant region-mediated activity (see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,648,260; 5,624,821).\n\n\nModified human IgG1 Fc have been generated for creating Fc fusion proteins. For example, Fc4, Fc5, and Fc6 mutations to reduce effector functions mediated by the Fc by reducing FcγRI binding and complement C1q binding are described in U.S. Patent Application 2006-0034852, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Specifically, three amino acid substitutions were introduced to reduce FcγRI binding. These are the substitutions at EU index positions 234, 235, and 237. Substitutions at these positions have been shown to reduce binding to FcγRI (Duncan et al., \nNature \n332:563 (1988)). These amino acid substitutions may also reduce FcγRIIa binding, as well as FcγRIII binding (Sondermann et al., \nNature \n406:267 (2000); Wines et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n164:5313 (2000)). These mutations do not alter binding to FcRn, which promotes long serum half-life by salvaging IgG through an endocytic recycling pathway.\n\n\nSeveral groups have described the relevance of EU index positions 330 and 331 in complement C1q binding and subsequent complement fixation (Canfield and Morrison, \nJ. Exp. Med. \n173:1483 (1991); Tao et al., \nJ. Exp. Med. \n178:661 (1993)). Amino acid substitutions at these positions were introduced in Fc4 to reduce complement fixation. The \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain of Fc4 is identical to that found in the corresponding wild-type polypeptide, except for the stop codon, which was changed from TGA to TAA to eliminate a potential dam methylation site when the cloned DNA is grown in dam plus strains of \nE. coli\n. In Fc5, the arginine residue at EU index position 218 is a lysine and the remainder of the Fc5 sequence matches the above description for Fc4.\n\n\nThe present invention also includes genetically altered antibodies that are functionally equivalent to the above-described antibodies. Modified antibodies providing improved stability and/or therapeutic efficacy are preferred. Examples of modified antibodies include those with conservative substitutions of amino acid residues, and one or more deletions or additions of amino acids which do not significantly deleteriously alter the antigen binding utility. Substitutions can range from changing or modifying one or more amino acid residues to complete redesign of a region as long as the therapeutic utility is maintained. Antibodies of the present invention can be can be modified post-translationally (e.g., acetylation, and phosphorylation) or can be modified synthetically (e.g., the attachment of a labeling group).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a bispecific binding composition of the invention neutralizes both IL-21 and a biological activity of a second target molecule, generally an antigen associated with autoimmune disease, and comprises an anti-IL-21 antibody as described herein. Accordingly, in particular variations, a bispecific binding composition comprises an anti-IL-21 antibody as described herein and a second binding entity capable of neutralizing the activity of the second antigen.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, two or more different entities of a bispecific binding composition are linked via linker to form a multimer (e.g., a dimer). For example, in the case of a bispecific binding composition comprising a fusion of at least two polypeptide components (e.g., an anti-IL-21 antibody and another polypeptide component), a peptide linker sequence may be employed to separate, for example, the polypeptide components by a distance sufficient to ensure that each polypeptide folds into its secondary and tertiary structures. Fusion proteins may generally be prepared using standard techniques, including chemical conjugation. Fusion proteins can also be expressed as recombinant proteins in an expression system by standard techniques. Suitable linkers are further described herein, infra.\n\n\nA linker can be naturally-occurring, synthetic, or a combination of both. For example, a synthetic linker can be a randomized linker, e.g., both in sequence and size. In one aspect, the randomized linker can comprise a fully randomized sequence, or optionally, the randomized linker can be based on natural linker sequences. The linker can comprise, for example, a non-polypeptide moiety (e.g., a polynucleotide), a polypeptide, or the like.\n\n\nA linker can be rigid, or alternatively, flexible, or a combination of both. Linker flexibility can be a function of the composition of both the linker and the subunits that the linker interacts with. The linker joins two selected binding entitities (e.g., two separate polypeptides or proteins, such as two different antibodies) and maintains the entities as separate and discrete. The linker can allow the separate, discrete domains to cooperate yet maintain separate properties such as multiple separate binding sites for the same target in a multimer or, for example, multiple separate binding sites for different targets in a multimer. In some cases, a disulfide bridge exists between two linked binding entities or between a linker and a binding entity.\n\n\nChoosing a suitable linker for a specific case where two or more binding entities are to be connected may depend on a variety of parameters including, e.g., the nature of the binding entities, the structure and nature of the target to which the bispecific composition should bind, and/or the stability of the linker (e.g., peptide linker) towards proteolysis and oxidation.\n\n\nParticularly suitable linker polypeptides predominantly include amino acid residues selected from Glycine (Gly), Serine (Ser), Alanine (Ala), and Threonine (Thr). For example, the peptide linker may contain at least 75% (calculated on the basis of the total number of residues present in the peptide linker), such as at least 80%, at least 85%, or at least 90% of amino acid residues selected from Gly, Ser, Ala, and Thr. The peptide linker may also consist of Gly, Ser, Ala and/or Thr residues only. The linker polypeptide should have a length that is adequate to link two binding entities in such a way that they assume the correct conformation relative to one another so that they retain the desired activity, such as binding to a target molecule as well as other activities that may be associated with such target binding (e.g., agonistic or antagonistic activity for a given biomolecule).\n\n\nA suitable length for this purpose is, e.g., a length of at least one and typically fewer than about 50 amino acid residues, such as 2-25 amino acid residues, 5-20 amino acid residues, 5-15 amino acid residues, 8-12 amino acid residues or 11 residues. Other suitable polypeptide linker sizes may include, e.g., from about 2 to about 15 amino acids, from about 3 to about 15, from about 4 to about 12, about 10, about 8, or about 6 amino acids. The amino acid residues selected for inclusion in the linker polypeptide should exhibit properties that do not interfere significantly with the activity or function of the polypeptide multimer. Thus, the peptide linker should, on the whole, not exhibit a charge that would be inconsistent with the activity or function of the multimer, or interfere with internal folding, or form bonds or other interactions with amino acid residues in one or more of the domains that would seriously impede the binding of the multimer to the target in question.\n\n\nThe use of naturally occurring as well as artificial peptide linkers to connect polypeptides into novel linked fusion polypeptides is well-known in the art. (See, e.g., Hallewell et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n264, 5260-5268, 1989; Alfthan et al., \nProtein Eng. \n8, 725-731, 1995; Robinson and Sauer, \nBiochemistry \n35, 109-116, 1996; Khandekar et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n272, 32190-32197, 1997; Fares et al., \nEndocrinology \n139, 2459-2464, 1998; Smallshaw et al., \nProtein Eng. \n12, 623-630, 1999; U.S. Pat. No. 5,856,456.)\n\n\nOne example where the use of peptide linkers is widespread is for production of single-chain antibodies where the variable regions of a light chain (V\nL\n) and a heavy chain (V\nH\n) are joined through an artificial linker, and a large number of publications exist within this particular field (see, for example, the linkers described in Le Gall et al., \nProtein Eng. Des. Sel., \n17(4): 357-66, 2004 and Volkel et al., \nProtein Eng., \n14(10): 815-23, 2001). Other linkers have been used, and phage display technology, as well as selective infective phage technology, has been used to diversify and select appropriate linker sequences (Tang et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n271, 15682-15686, 1996; Hennecke et al., \nProtein Eng. \n11, 405-410, 1998). Peptide linkers have been used to connect individual chains in hetero- and homo-dimeric proteins such as the T-cell receptor, the lambda Cro repressor, the P22 phage Arc repressor, IL-12, TSH, FSH, IL-5, and interferon-γ. Peptide linkers have also been used to create fusion polypeptides. Various linkers have been used, and, in the case of the Arc repressor, phage display has been used to optimize the linker length and composition for increased stability of the single-chain protein (see Robinson and Sauer, \nProc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA \n95, 5929-5934, 1998).\n\n\nStill another way of obtaining a suitable linker is by optimizing a simple linker through random mutagenesis.\n\n\nAs discussed above, it is generally preferred that the peptide linker possess at least some flexibility. Accordingly, in some variations, the peptide linker contains 1-25 glycine residues, 5-20 glycine residues, 5-15 glycine residues, or 8-12 glycine residues. Particularly suitable peptide linkers typically contain at least 50% glycine residues, such as at least 75% glycine residues. In some embodiments, a peptide linker comprises glycine residues only. In certain variations, the peptide linker comprises other residues in addition to the glycine. Preferred residues in addition to glycine include Ser, Ala, and Thr, particularly Ser.\n\n\nIn some cases, it may be desirable or necessary to provide some rigidity into the peptide linker. This may be accomplished by including proline residues in the amino acid sequence of the peptide linker. Thus, in another embodiment, a peptide linker comprises at least one proline residue in the amino acid sequence of the peptide linker. For example, a peptide linker can have an amino acid sequence wherein at least 25% (e.g., at least 50% or at least 75%) of the amino acid residues are proline residues. In one particular embodiment of the invention, the peptide linker comprises proline residues only.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, a peptide linker is modified in such a way that an amino acid residue comprising an attachment group for a non-polypeptide moiety is introduced. Examples of such amino acid residues may be a cysteine or a lysine residue (to which the non-polypeptide moiety is then subsequently attached). Another alternative is to include an amino acid sequence having an in vivo N-glycosylation site (thereby attaching a sugar moiety (in vivo) to the peptide linker). An additional option is to genetically incorporate non-natural amino acids using evolved tRNAs and tRNA synthetases (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication 2003/0082575) into a polypeptide binding entity or peptide linker. For example, insertion of keto-tyrosine allows for site-specific coupling to an expressed polypeptide.\n\n\nIn certain variations, a peptide linker comprises at least one cysteine residue, such as one cysteine residue. For example, in some embodiments, a peptide linker comprises at least one cysteine residue and amino acid residues selected from the group consisting of Gly, Ser, Ala, and Thr. In some such embodiments, a peptide linker comprises glycine residues and cysteine residues, such as glycine residues and cysteine residues only. Typically, only one cysteine residue will be included per peptide linker.\n\n\nAs previously noted, in certain embodiments, a bispecific binding composition comprises an anti-IL-21 antibody and an antibody specific for a second antigen. In some such embodiments, the anti-IL-21 and antibodies to the second antigen are covalently linked (e.g., via a peptide linker) to form a bispecific antibody. In some variations, the bispecific antibody comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region such as, for example, an Fc fragment. Particularly suitable Fc fragments include, for example, Fc fragments comprising an Fc region modified to reduce or eliminate one or more effector functions.\n\n\nIn certain preferred embodiments, a bispecific antibody in accordance with the present invention is a tandem single chain Fv (tascFv), bispecific single chain Fv (biscFv), or a bispecific antibody (biAb). For the tascFv molecule, two scFv molecules are constructed such that one scFv is amino terminal to the other one in a tandem configuration. This can be done in each orientation. Tandem scFv molecules can be prepared with a linker between the scFv entites. In some embodiments, the linker is a Gly-Ser linker comprising a series of glycine and serine residues, and optionally including additional amino acids. In other embodiments, the linker is a lambda stump or a CH1 stump, both of which are derived from the native sequence just after the V region in the Fab. The tascFv can be further constructed as fusion protein to contain a Fc component (“tascFv Fc”). In some such embodiments, such an Fc fragment comprises an Fc region modified to reduce or eliminate one or more effector functions.\n\n\nThe biscFv molecule is not a tandem configuration. Rather, it has a scFv at the N terminus and another at the C terminus of an Fc (“biscFv Fc”). These molecules can be made with the N terminal scFv directly fused to the Fc hinge and with either a short or a long linker at the C terminus connecting to the second scFv. These linkers are typically Gly-Ser linkers. In some embodiments, the Fe fragment comprises an Fc region modified to reduce or eliminate one or more effector functions.\n\n\nThe biAb molecule is also not a tandem format. It comprises a whole monoclonal antibody with a scFv fused to the C terminus of the heavy chain. These molecules can be made, for example, by converting one scFv back to a light chain (kappa or lambda) and a gammal heavy chain with the second scFv connected by either a short or long Gly-Ser linker. These molecules can be made with a whole anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody fused to an second antigen scFv or, alternatively, with a whole second antigen monoclonal antibody fused to an anti-IL-21 scFv. In some particular embodiments, a biAb in accordance with the present invention comprises a whole anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody (IgG1) with the C-terminal end of the heavy chain fused to an antibody specific for a second antigen in scFv form.\n\n\nAntibodies of the present invention may be described or specified in terms of the epitope(s) or portion(s) of an IL-21 polypeptide of the present invention that they recognize or specifically bind. The epitope(s) or polypeptide portion(s) may be specified as described herein, e.g., by N-terminal and C-terminal positions, or by size in contiguous amino acid residues. Antibodies of the present invention may also be described or specified in terms of their cross-reactivity. Antibodies that do not bind any other analog, ortholog, or homolog of a polypeptide of the present invention are included.\n\n\nEpitope binning refers to the use of competitive binding assays to identify pairs of antibodies that are, or are not, capable of binding IL-21 protein simultaneously thereby identifying antibodies that bind to the same, or overlapping epitopes on protein. Families of antibodies (or bins) having the same or overlapping binding specificity can then be used to help define specific epitopes on IL-21. Epitope binning experiments provide evidence that antigenically distinct epitopes are present. However, by themselves, they do not identify, or “map” the epitope to a specific amino acid sequence or location on the IL-21 protein molecule.\n\n\nCompetition for binding can be evaluated for any pair of antibodies or fragments. For example, using the appropriate detection reagents, the binding specificity of antibodies or binding fragments from any species/source can be compared to the binding specificity of the monoclonal antibodies disclosed herein. Epitope binning can be performed with “isolated antibodies” or with cell culture supernatants. Frequently, binning is performed with first round clonal supernatants to guide the choice of clones to be developed further. The antibodies to be compared should have substantially homogeneous antigen binding domains. In the case of “bispecific” or “bifunctional” antibodies the binding specificity of the two different binding sites need to be evaluated or binned independently.\n\n\nThe present invention features ligand-specific antibodies. In addition to competitive binding of antibodies, epitope binning can also be used to identify antibodies to either a receptor or a ligand that competitively interfere with the binding of a ligand to its receptor or the ligand mediated activation of its receptor. Frequently, favorable properties, of a family (or bin) of antibodies can be correlated with a binding to a specific epitope defined by the epitope bin.\n\n\nCompetitive binding experiments do not directly measure the binding affinity, however the antibodies to be tested must bind sufficiently strongly to act as competitors. Generally experimental conditions are designed to minimize the effects of differences in binding affinity.\n\n\nAnti-IL-21 antibodies may also be useful in diagnostic assays for IL-21 protein, e.g., detecting its expression in specific cells, tissues, or serum. Antibodies assigned to different bins and capable of binding to different immunogenic portions, or epitopes, of IL-21 may be used as the reagents for sandwich assays. In a sandwich assay, the test sample analyte is captured by a first antibody which is immobilized on a solid support, and thereafter detected by a second antibody that also binds to the analyte, thus forming an insoluble three-part complex. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110. The second antibody may itself be labeled with a detectable moiety (direct sandwich assays) or may be measured using an anti-immunoglobulin antibody that is labeled with a detectable moiety (indirect sandwich assay). For example, one type of sandwich assay is an ELISA assay, in which case the detectable moiety is an enzyme.\n\n\nThe antibodies of the present invention may be assayed for specific binding by any method known in the art. Many different competitive binding assay format(s) can be used for epitope binning. The immunoassays which can be used include, but are not limited to, competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), “sandwich” immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, to name just a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York). Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below (but are not intended by way of limitation). Additionally, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in \nAntibodies. A Laboratory Manual\n, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed.\n\n\nThe BIACORE® (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.) is only one of a variety of surface plasmon resonance assay formats that are routinely used to epitope bin panels of monoclonal antibodies. Many references (e.g. The Epitope Mapping Protocols, \nMethods in Molecular Biology\n, \nVolume\n 66 Glenn E. Morris ed. Humana Press, 1996) describe alternative methods that could be used to bin antibodies and would be expected to provide comparable information regarding the binding specificity of the antibodies to IL-21 protein. When using the BIACORE® system, epitope binning experiments are performed with soluble, native or recombinant antigen. Epitope binning studies can be performed on a BIACORE1000® system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). BIAlogue® v. 1.2 software can be used for programming run methods. For the example of using the BIACORE® to bin mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against IL-21, polyclonal goat anti-Mouse IgG Fc antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.) can be covalently immobilized to a BIACORE® CM5 sensor chip and used to bind (capture) the primary monoclonal antibody of test series to the chip. Unoccupied Fc binding sites on the chip are then blocked using a polyclonal IgG Fc fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.). Subsequently, IL-21 protein is injected and allowed to specifically bind to the captured primary monoclonal antibody. The BIACORE® instrument measures the mass of protein bound to the sensor chip, and the binding of both the primary antibody and IL-21 antigen can be verified for each cycle. Following the binding of the primary antibody and antigen to the chip, soluble secondary antibody is injected and allowed to bind to the pre-bound antigen. If the secondary monoclonal antibody is capable of binding the IL-21 antigen simultaneously with the primary monoclonal antibody, its binding is detected by the BIACORE®. If, however, the secondary monoclonal antibody is not capable of binding the IL-21 antigen simultaneously with the primary monoclonal antibody, no additional binding is detected. Each monoclonal antibody is tested against itself as a negative control to establish the level of the background (no-binding) signal.\n\n\nA label-free competitive ELISA format (LFC-ELISA) can also be used to bin antibodies. This method is described by Nagata et al., \nJ. Immuno Methods \n292:141-155, 2004. This method for epitope binning utilized biotinylated IL-21. For the example of binning mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against IL-21, microtiter plates are coated at 100 μL/well with 1 μg/mL of a goat anti-mouse IgG Fc-γ specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in ELISA B (PBS, 0.1\n \n% Tween\n \n 20, 1% BSA). After binding of this coating antibody for 3 hours at ambient temperature, each mAb-containing conditioned media is diluted in ELISA B to yield an approximate mAb concentration of 0.5 μg/mL and allowed to bind to the goat anti-mouse IgG coated plates overnight at 4° C. (mAb#1). In parallel, a second set of conditioned medias (mAb#2) are diluted in polystyrene test tubes to approximately 0.5 μg/mL mAb in ELISA B, mixed with 50 ng/mL biotinylated IL-21 antigen, and incubated overnight at 4° C. After incubation of \nmAb#\n1 with the coating antibody, the plates are blocked with an unrelated antibody to saturate unoccupied binding sites on the plate. The mAb#2-biotin-IL-21 mixtures are added to the plate and allowed to bind. As a control for (non-competition) in the assay, 50 ng/mL biotinylated IL-21 is added directly (without pre-incubation with mAb#2) to wells containing immobilized \nmAb#\n1. After incubation with the biotinylated-IL-21-\nmAb#\n2 complex, streptavidin-HRP (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) is added to the plate at 0.5 μg/mL. The plates are developed with TMB substrate (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.), and the absorbance of the individual wells at 450 nm is measured with a plate reader (Molecular Devices SPECTRAMAX®340, Sunnyvale, Calif.). If \nmAb#\n1 binds to a different epitope from \nmAb#\n2, the biotin-IL-21-\nmAb#\n2 complex will bind to the plate resulting in a high absorbance reading. If \nmAb#\n1 binds to the same epitope as \nmAb#\n2, the biotin-IL-21-\nMAb#\n2 complex will not bind to the plate resulting in a low absorbance reading.\n\n\nLigand-specific antibodies of the present invention can simply bind to or act as antagonists of IL-21. For example, the present invention includes antibodies which do not disrupt IL-21's receptor/ligand interactions or disrupt IL-21's receptor/ligand interactions either partially or fully. The invention features ligand-specific antibodies that prevent receptor activation. The invention includes neutralizing antibodies which bind the ligand and prevent binding of the ligand to the receptor, as well as antibodies which bind the ligand, thereby preventing receptor activation, but do not prevent the ligand from binding the receptor. Receptor activation (i.e., signaling) may be determined by techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. For example, receptor activation can be determined by detecting the phosphorylation (e.g., tyrosine or serine/threonine) of the receptor or its substrate by immunoprecipitation followed by western blot or luminex based analysis (for example, as described supra). In specific embodiments, antibodies are provided that inhibit ligand or receptor activity by at least 90%, at least 80%, at least 70%, at least 60%, or at least 50% of the activity in absence of the antibody.\n\n\nProduction of Antibodies\n\n\nAntibodies to IL-21 can be generated, for example, using protein that is the product of an IL-21 expression vector or IL-21 isolated from a natural source as an antigen. Anti-IL-21 antibodies of the present invention “bind specifically” to IL-21. Antibodies are considered to be specifically binding if the antibodies exhibit at least one of the following two properties: (1) antibodies bind to IL-21 with a threshold level of binding activity, and (2) antibodies do not significantly cross-react with polypeptides related to IL-21. Related polypeptides could include those of other members of the \nType\n 1 cytokines that bind gamma common chain (γc)-containing receptors, such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15.\n\n\nWith regard to the first characteristic, antibodies specifically bind if they bind to a IL-21 polypeptide, peptide or epitope with a binding affinity as reflected in the measured affinity constants. To determine the affinity characteristics, measurements of the kinetic rate constants, equilibrium association constants, and equilibrium dissociation constants were assessed for the interaction of IL-21 antagonists with the IL-21 antigen via surface plasmon resonance. The association rate constant (k\na\n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)) is a value that reflects the rate of the antigen-antagonist complex formation. The dissociation rate constant (k\nd\n(s\n−1\n)) is a value that reflects the stability of this complex. Equilibrium binding affinity is typically expressed as either a dissociation equilibrium constant (K\nD\n(M)) or an association equilibrium constant (K\nA\n(M\n−1\n)). K\nD \nis obtained by dividing the dissociation rate constant by the association rate constant (k\nd\n/k\na\n), while K\nA \nis obtained by dividing the association rate constant by the dissociation rate constant (k\na\n/k\nd\n). Antagonists with similar K\nD \n(or a similar K\nA\n) can have widely variable association and dissociation rate constants. Consequently, measuring the k\na \nand k\nd \nas well as the K\nA \nor K\nD \nhelps to more uniquely describe the affinity of the antagonist-antigen interaction. The preferred affinity of an antibody is reflected in a KA (equilibrium association constant) of 10\n6 \nM\n−1 \nor greater, preferably 10\n7 \nM\n−1 \nor greater, more preferably 10\n8 \nM\n−1 \nor greater, and most preferably 10\n9 \nM\n−1 \nor greater. The binding affinity of an antibody can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, for example, by Scatchard analysis (Scatchard, \nAnn. NY Acad. Sci. \n51:660, 1949), or using a commercially available biosensor instrument. With regard to the second characteristic, antibodies do not significantly cross-react with related polypeptide molecules, for example, if they detect IL-21, but not other known polypeptides using a standard Western blot analysis or capture ELISA. Examples of known related polypeptides include known members of the IL-2 family to which IL-21 belongs (for example, IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15).\n\n\nMonoclonal anti-IL-21 antibodies can be produced using antigenic IL-21 epitope-bearing peptides and polypeptides. Antibodies of the present invention bind antigenic epitope-bearing peptides and polypeptides containing a sequence of at least nine, or between 15 to about 30 amino acids contained within SEQ ID NO:2 or another amino acid sequence disclosed herein. However, peptides or polypeptides comprising a larger portion of an amino acid sequence containing from 30 to 50 amino acids, or any length up to and including the entire amino acid sequence of a polypeptide also are useful for inducing antibodies that bind with IL-21. It is desirable that the amino acid sequence of the epitope-bearing peptide is selected to provide substantial solubility in aqueous solvents (i.e., the sequence includes relatively hydrophilic residues, while hydrophobic residues are typically avoided). Moreover, amino acid sequences containing proline residues may be also be desirable for large scale-antibody production.\n\n\nMonoclonal anti-IL-21 antibodies can be generated by methods known to those skilled in the art. Rodent monoclonal antibodies to specific antigens may be obtained by known methods (see, for example, Kohler et al., \nNature \n256:495 (1975), Coligan et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Immunology, Vol. 1, pages 2.5.1-2.6.7 (John Wiley & Sons 1991) [“Coligan”], Picksley et al., “Production of monoclonal antibodies against proteins expressed in \nE. coli,”\n in \nDNA Cloning \n2: \nExpression Systems, \n2nd Edition, Glover et al. (eds.), page 93 (Oxford University Press 1995)).\n\n\nAntibodies to a second antigen, related to autoimmune disease, can be generated, for example, using protein that is the product of an expression vector or that antigen isolated from a natural source. Antibodies to the second antigen that comprise the present invention “bind specifically” to their antigen. Antibodies are considered to be specifically binding if the antibodies exhibit at least one of the following two properties: (1) antibodies bind to the antigen with a threshold level of binding activity, and (2) antibodies do not significantly cross-react with polypeptides related to the antigen. Related polypeptides could include those of other members of the antigen's protein family.\n\n\nWith regard to the first characteristic, antibodies specifically bind if they bind to a the second antigen polypeptide, peptide or epitope with a binding affinity as reflected in the measured affinity constants. To determine the affinity characteristics, measurements of the kinetic rate constants, equilibrium association constants, and equilibrium dissociation constants were assessed for the interaction of second antigen antagonists with the second antigen via surface plasmon resonance. The association rate constant (k\na\n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)) is a value that reflects the rate of the antigen-antagonist complex formation. The dissociation rate constant (k\nd\n(s\n−1\n)) is a value that reflects the stability of this complex. Equilibrium binding affinity is typically expressed as either a dissociation equilibrium constant (K\nD\n(M)) or an association equilibrium constant (K\nA\n(M\n−1\n)). K\nD \nis obtained by dividing the dissociation rate constant by the association rate constant (k\nd\n/k\na\n), while K\nA \nis obtained by dividing the association rate constant by the dissociation rate constant (k\na\n/k\nd\n). Antagonists with similar K\nD \n(or a similar K\nA\n) can have widely variable association and dissociation rate constants. Consequently, measuring the k\na \nand k\nd \nas well as the K\nA \nor K\nD \nhelps to more uniquely describe the affinity of the antagonist-antigen interaction. The preferred affinity of an antibody is reflected in a K\nA \n(equilibrium association constant) of 10\n6 \nM\n−1 \nor greater, preferably 10\n7 \nM\n−1 \nor greater, more preferably 10\n8 \nM\n−1 \nor greater, and most preferably 10\n9 \nM\n−1 \nor greater.

With regard to the second characteristic, antibodies do not significantly cross-react with related polypeptide molecules, for example, if they detect the second antigen, but not other known polypeptides using a standard Western blot analysis or capture ELISA.\n\n\nMonoclonal anti-second antigen antibodies can be produced using antigenic epitope-bearing peptides and polypeptides of that antigen. Antibodies of the present invention bind antigenic epitope-bearing peptides and polypeptides containing a sequence of at least nine, or between 15 to about 30 amino acids of its protein sequence. However, peptides or polypeptides comprising a larger portion of an amino acid sequence containing from 30 to 50 amino acids, or any length up to and including the entire amino acid sequence of a polypeptide also are useful for inducing antibodies that bind with the second antigen. It is desirable that the amino acid sequence of the epitope-bearing peptide is selected to provide substantial solubility in aqueous solvents (i.e., the sequence includes relatively hydrophilic residues, while hydrophobic residues are typically avoided). Moreover, amino acid sequences containing proline residues may be also be desirable for large scale-antibody production.\n\n\nMonoclonal anti-second antigen antibodies can be generated by methods known to those skilled in the art. Rodent monoclonal antibodies to specific antigens may be obtained by known methods (see, for example, Kohler et al., \nNature \n256:495 (1975), Coligan et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Immunology, Vol. 1, pages 2.5.1-2.6.7 (John Wiley & Sons 1991) [“Coligan”], Picksley et al., “Production of monoclonal antibodies against proteins expressed in \nE. coli,”\n in \nDNA Cloning \n2: \nExpression Systems, \n2nd Edition, Glover et al. (eds.), page 93 (Oxford University Press 1995)).\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention for the second antigen can be produced by any method known in the art for the synthesis of antibodies, in particular, by chemical synthesis or preferably, by recombinant expression techniques. Recombinant expression of an antibody of the invention, or fragment, derivative or analog thereof, e.g., a heavy or light chain of an antibody of the invention, requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule or a heavy or light chain of an antibody, or portion thereof (preferably containing the heavy or light chain variable domain), of the invention has been obtained, the vector for the production of the antibody molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus, methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention, thus, provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the invention, or a heavy or light chain thereof, or a heavy or light chain variable domain, operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule (see, e.g., PCT Publication WO 86/05807; PCT Publication WO 89/01036; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,464) and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy or light chain.\n\n\nThe expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody to a second antigen of the invention. Thus, the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention, or a heavy or light chain thereof, operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred embodiments for the expression of double-chained antibodies, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule, as detailed below.\n\n\nA variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antibody molecules of the invention, including those that specifically bind the second antigen. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., \nE. coli, B. subtilis\n) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; yeast (e.g., \nSaccharomyces, Pichia\n) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing antibody coding sequences; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing antibody coding sequences; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293, 3T3 cells) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., MPSV, CMV, the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter). Preferably, bacterial cells such as \nEscherichia coli\n, and more preferably, eukaryotic cells, especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule, are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus, CMV enhancer or MPSV promoter is an effective expression system for antibodies (Foecking et al., 1986, \nGene \n45:101; Cockett et al., 1990, \nBio/Technology \n8:2).\n\n\nIn bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited, to the \nE. coli \nexpression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al., 1983, \nEMBO J. \n2:1791), in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lacZ coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye & Inouye, \nNucleic Acids Res. \n13:3101-3109, 1985; Van Heeke & Schuster, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n24:5503-5509, 1989); and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to a matrix glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.\n\n\nIn an insect system, \nAutographa californica \nnuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in \nSpodoptera frugiperda \ncells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non-essential regions (for example the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (for example the polyhedrin promoter).\n\n\nIn mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts. (e.g., see Logan & Shenk, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81:355-359, 1984). Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bittner et al., \nMethods in Enzymol. \n153:51-544, 1987).\n\n\nIn addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERO, BHK, Hela, COS, MDCK, 293, 3T3, WI38, and in particular, breast cancer cell lines such as, for example, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, and normal mammary gland cell line such as, for example, CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.\n\n\nFor long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.\n\n\nA number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al., \nCell \n11:223, 1977), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Sybalska & Szybalski, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n48:202, 1992), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al., \nCell \n22:817, 1980) genes can be employed in tk-, hgprt- or aprt-cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n77:357, 1980; O'Hare et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n78:1527, 1981); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan & Berg, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n78:2072, 1981); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 (Wu and Wu, \nBiotherapy \n3:87-95, 1991; Tolstoshev, \nAnn. Rev. Pharmacol.

Biochem. \n62:191-217, 1993; \nTIB TECH \n11(5):155-215), May, 1993; and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al., \nGene \n30:147, 1984). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), 1993, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY; Kriegler, 1990, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, NY; and in Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli et al. (eds), 1994, Current Protocols in Human Genetics, John Wiley & Sons, NY.; Colberre-Garapin et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n150:1, 1981; which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.\n\n\nThe expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel, The use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in DNA cloning, Vol. 3. (Academic Press, New York, 1987)). When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse et al., \nMol. Cell. Biol. \n3:257, 1983).\n\n\nThe host cell may be co-transfected with two expression vectors of the invention, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector may be used which encodes both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot, \nNature \n322:52, 1986; Kohler, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n77:2197, 1980). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.\n\n\nOnce an antibody molecule of the invention has been recombinantly expressed, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins.\n\n\nFor particular uses, it may be desirable to prepare fragments of anti-IL-21 antibodies. Such antibody fragments can be obtained, for example, by proteolytic hydrolysis of the antibody. Antibody fragments can be obtained by pepsin or papain digestion of whole antibodies by conventional methods. As an illustration, antibody fragments can be produced by enzymatic cleavage of antibodies with pepsin to provide a 5S fragment denoted F(ab′)2. This fragment can be further cleaved using a thiol reducing agent to produce 3.5S Fab′ monovalent fragments. Optionally, the cleavage reaction can be performed using a blocking group for the sulfhydryl groups that result from cleavage of disulfide linkages. As an alternative, an enzymatic cleavage using pepsin produces two monovalent Fab fragments and an Fc fragment directly. These methods are described, for example, by Goldenberg, U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,647, Nisonoff et al., Arch \nBiochem. Biophys. \n89:230, 1960; Porter, \nBiochem. J. \n73:119, 1959; Edelman et al., in Methods in Enzymology Vol. 1, page 422 (Academic Press 1967), and by Coligan at pages 2.8.1-2.8.10 and 2.10.-2.10.4.\n\n\nOther methods of cleaving antibodies, such as separation of heavy chains to form monovalent light-heavy chain fragments, further cleavage of fragments, or other enzymatic, chemical or genetic techniques may also be used, so long as the fragments bind to the antigen that is recognized by the intact antibody.\n\n\nFor example, Fv fragments comprise an association of VH and VL chains. This association can be noncovalent, as described by Inbar et al., \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n69:2659, 1972. Alternatively, the variable chains can be linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond or cross-linked by chemicals such as glutaraldehyde (see, for example, Sandhu, \nCrit. Rev. Biotech. \n12:437, 1992).\n\n\nThe Fv fragments may comprise VH and VL chains which are connected by a peptide linker. These single-chain antigen binding proteins (scFv) are prepared by constructing a structural gene comprising DNA sequences encoding the VH and VL domains which are connected by an oligonucleotide. The structural gene is inserted into an expression vector which is subsequently introduced into a host cell, such as \nE. coli\n. The recombinant host cells synthesize a single polypeptide chain with a linker peptide bridging the two V domains. Methods for producing scFvs are described, for example, by Whitlow et al.; Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology 2:97 (1991) (also see, Bird et al., \nScience \n242:423, 1988, Ladner et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,946,778, Pack et al., \nBio/Technology \n11:1271, 1993, and Sandhu, supra).\n\n\nIt is also possible to construct alternative frameworks by using a collection of monomeric proteins to form a monomer domain. These monomer domains can be small enough to penetrate tissues. The monomer domains can be naturally-occurring or non-natural variants or combination thereof. Monomer domains can form multimers of two or more domains. The monomer domain binds a position, analogous to epitopes described herein, on a target molecule. In some cases, the multimer can be formed from a variety of monomer domains. (See, e.g. U.S. Patent Application 2004-0132028 and U.S. Patent Application 2006-0177831.)\n\n\nThe antibodies of the present invention include derivatives that are modified, i.e, by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody such that covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody from binding IL-21 or blocking receptor activation or from binding the second antigen, if the antibody is bispecific. For example, but not by way of limitation, the antibody derivatives include antibodies that have been modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the derivative may contain one or more non-classical amino acids.\n\n\nAn anti-IL-21 antibody or second antigen antibody can be conjugated with a detectable label to form an anti-IL-21 immunoconjugate. Suitable detectable labels include, for example, a radioisotope, a fluorescent label, a chemiluminescent label, an enzyme label, a bioluminescent label or colloidal gold. Methods of making and detecting such detectably-labeled immunoconjugates are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and are described in more detail below. The detectable label can be a radioisotope that is detected by autoradiography. Isotopes that are particularly useful for the purpose of the present invention are \n3\nH, \n125\nI, \n131\nI, \n35\nS and \n14\nC.\n\n\nAnti-IL-21 or second antigen antibody immunoconjugates can also be labeled with a fluorescent compound. The presence of a fluorescently-labeled antibody is determined by exposing the immunoconjugate to light of the proper wavelength and detecting the resultant fluorescence. Fluorescent labeling compounds include fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycoerytherin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaldehyde, alexadyes, fluorescent nonparticles (e.g. Q dots) and fluorescamine.\n\n\nIt is also possible that anti-IL-21 immunoconjugates or second antigen immunoconjugates can be detectably labeled by coupling an antibody component to a chemiluminescent compound. The presence of the chemiluminescent-tagged immunoconjugate is determined by detecting the presence of luminescence that arises during the course of a chemical reaction. Examples of chemiluminescent labeling compounds include luminol, isoluminol, an aromatic acridinium ester, an imidazole, an acridinium salt and an oxalate ester.\n\n\nSimilarly, a bioluminescent compound can be used to label anti-IL-21 or second antibody immunoconjugates of the present invention. Bioluminescence is a type of chemiluminescence found in biological systems in which a catalytic protein increases the efficiency of the chemiluminescent reaction. The presence of a bioluminescent protein is determined by detecting the presence of luminescence. Bioluminescent compounds that are useful for labeling include luciferin, luciferase and aequorin.\n\n\nAlternatively, anti-IL-21 or second antibody immunoconjugates can be detectably labeled by linking an anti-IL-21 antibody component to an enzyme. When the anti-IL-21-enzyme conjugate is incubated in the presence of the appropriate substrate, the enzyme moiety reacts with the substrate to produce a chemical moiety which can be detected, for example, by spectrophotometric, fluorometric or visual means. Examples of enzymes that can be used to detectably label polyspecific immunoconjugates include β-galactosidase, glucose oxidase, peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase.\n\n\nThose of skill in the art will know of other suitable labels which can be employed in accordance with the present invention The binding of marker moieties to anti-IL-21 antibodies can be accomplished using standard techniques known to the art. Typical methodology in this regard is described by the following: Kennedy et al., \nClin. Chim. Acta \n70:1, 1976; Schurs et al., \nClin. Chim. Acta \n81:1, 1977; Shih et al., \nInt'l J. Cancer \n46:1101, 1990; Stein et al., \nCancer Res. \n50:1330, 1990; and Coligan, supra.\n\n\nMoreover, the convenience and versatility of immunochemical detection can be enhanced by using anti-IL-21 or second antibody antibodies that have been conjugated with avidin, streptavidin, and biotin (see, for example, Wilchek et al. (eds.), “Avidin-Biotin Technology,” Methods In Enzymology, Vol. 184 (Academic Press 1990), and Bayer et al., “Immunochemical Applications of Avidin-Biotin Technology,” in Methods In Molecular Biology, Vol. 10, Manson (ed.), pages 149-162 (The Humana Press, Inc. 1992).\n\n\nMethods for performing immunoassays are well-established. See, for example, Cook and Self, “Monoclonal Antibodies in Diagnostic Immunoassays,” in \nMonoclonal Antibodies: Production, Engineering, and Clinical Application\n, Ritter and Ladyman (eds.), pages 180-208, (Cambridge University Press, 1995), Perry, “The Role of Monoclonal Antibodies in the Advancement of Immunoassay Technology,” in \nMonoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Applications\n, Birch and Lennox (eds.), pages 107-120 (Wiley-Liss, Inc. 1995), and Diamandis, \nImmunoassay \n(Academic Press, Inc. 1996).\n\n\nAntibodies or fragments thereof having increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, antibodies or fragments thereof with increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by modifying (e.g., substituting, deleting or adding) amino acid residues identified as involved in the interaction between the Fc domain and the FcRn receptor (see, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 97/34631 and WO 02/060919, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). Antibodies or fragments thereof with increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by attaching to said antibodies or antibody fragments polymer molecules such as high molecular weight polyethyleneglycol (PEG). PEG can be attached to said antibodies or antibody fragments with or without a multifunctional linker either through site-specific conjugation of the PEG, for example, to the N- or C-terminus of said antibodies or antibody fragments or via epsilon-amino groups present on lysine residues. Linear or branched polymer derivatization that results in minimal loss of biological activity will be used. The degree of conjugation will be closely monitored by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry to ensure proper conjugation of PEG molecules to the antibodies. Unreacted PEG can be separated from antibody-PEG conjugates by, e.g., size exclusion or ion-exchange chromatography.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nThe present invention further includes pharmaceutical compositions, comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and one or more polypeptide or antibody described herein. The pharmaceutical composition can include additional therapeutic agents, including but not limited to cytotoxic agents a cytotoxin, e.g., a cytostatic or cytocidal agent, a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples include paclitaxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. Therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine), alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, thioepa chlorambucil, melphalan, carmustine (BSNU) and lomustine (CCNU), cyclothosphamide, busulfan, dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II) (DDP) cisplatin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin (formerly daunomycin) and doxorubicin), antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin (formerly actinomycin), bleomycin, mithramycin, and anthramycin (AMC)), and anti-mitotic agents (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine). For example, the pharmaceutical composition can comprise a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, α-IFN, β-IFN, nerve growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, tissue plasminogen activator, a thrombotic agent or an anti-angiogenic agent, e.g., angiostatin or endostatin; or, biological response modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines, interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), antibodies designed to antagonize biological response modifiers, other antibodies, other Fc fusion proteins or other growth factors.\n\n\nFor purposes of therapy, anti-IL-21 antibody molecules and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier are administered to a patient in a therapeutically effective amount. This administered composition can also comprise a second antibody to autoimmune related antigen, as described above. A combination of a therapeutic molecule of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is said to be administered in a “therapeutically effective amount” if the amount administered is physiologically significant. An agent is physiologically significant if its presence results in a detectable change in the physiology of a recipient patient. For example, an agent used to treat inflammation is physiologically significant if its presence alleviates the inflammatory response.\n\n\nDegradable polymer microspheres have been designed to maintain high systemic levels of therapeutic proteins. Microspheres are prepared from degradable polymers such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG), polyanhydrides, poly (ortho esters), nonbiodegradable ethylvinyl acetate polymers, in which proteins are entrapped in the polymer (Gombotz and Pettit, \nBioconjugate Chem. \n6:332, 1995; Ranade, “Role of Polymers in Drug Delivery,” in \nDrug Delivery Systems\n, Ranade and Hollinger (eds.), pages 51-93 (CRC Press 1995); Roskos and Maskiewicz, “Degradable Controlled Release Systems Useful for Protein Delivery,” in \nProtein Delivery\n: Physical Systems, Sanders and Hendren (eds.), pages 45-92 (Plenum Press 1997); Bartus et al., \nScience \n281:1161, 1998; Putney and Burke, \nNature Biotechnology \n16:153, 1998; Putney, \nCurr. Opin. Chem. Biol. \n2:548, 1998). Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated nanospheres can also provide carriers for intravenous administration of therapeutic proteins (see, for example, Gref et al., \nPharm. Biotechnol. \n10:167, 1997).\n\n\nOther dosage forms can be devised by those skilled in the art, as shown, for example, by Ansel and Popovich, \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, \n5th Edition (Lea & Febiger 1990), Gennaro (ed.), \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. \n19th Edition (Mack Publishing Company 1995), and by Ranade and Hollinger, \nDrug Delivery Systems \n(CRC Press 1996).\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions may be supplied as a kit comprising a container that comprises a neutralizing anti-IL-21 antibody. The kit can also comprise an antibody to a second autoimmune disease related antigen as described above. Therapeutic polypeptides can be provided in the form of an injectable solution for single or multiple doses, or as a sterile powder that will be reconstituted before injection. Alternatively, such a kit can include a dry-powder disperser, liquid aerosol generator, or nebulizer for administration of a therapeutic polypeptide. Such a kit may further comprise written information on indications and usage of the pharmaceutical composition.\n\n\nA pharmaceutical composition comprising anti-IL-21 antibodies and/or an additional second antibody can be furnished in liquid form, in an aerosol, or in solid form. Liquid forms, are illustrated by injectable solutions, aerosols, droplets, topological solutions and oral suspensions. Exemplary solid forms include capsules, tablets, and controlled-release forms. The latter form is illustrated by miniosmotic pumps and implants (Bremer et al., \nPharm. Biotechnol. \n10:239, 1997; Ranade, “Implants in Drug Delivery,” in \nDrug Delivery Systems\n. Ranade and Hollinger (eds.), pages 95-123 (CRC Press 1995); Bremer et al., “Protein Delivery with Infusion Pumps,” in \nProtein Delivery: Physical Systems\n. Sanders and Hendren (eds.), pages 239-254 (Plenum Press 1997); Yewey et al., “Delivery of Proteins from a Controlled Release Injectable Implant,” in \nProtein Delivery: Physical Systems\n, Sanders and Hendren (eds.), pages 93-117 (Plenum Press 1997)). Other solid forms include creams, pastes, other topological applications, and the like.\n\n\nTherapeutic Uses for Anti-IL-21 Antibodies or Anti-IL-21 and Second Antigen Bispecific Antibodies\n\n\nIL-21 is a CD4\n+\n T cell-derived cytokine that is important for optimal CD8\n+\n T cell mediated immunity, NK cell activation, and optimal humoral responses, such as antibody production and B cell maturation. IL-21 has been shown to induce a number of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, such as IL-18, IL-15, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7A, IL-17F, TNFRII, sCD25, and RANTES. IL-21 also induces an acute phase response in non-human primates and humans when administered by IV or SC injection (Dodds et al., \nCancer Immunol Immunother \n2008 Oct. 17 [electronic publication]). In vitro, stimulates the growth of certain neoplastic immune cell populations such as multiple myeloma cells and acute T-cell leukemia (Brenne et al \nBlood \n99(10):3756-62 (2002), diCarlo E, et al \nCancer Immunol Immunother \n56(9):1323-1324 (2007)). IL-21 is also produced by Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's Lymphoma (Lamprecht et al., \nBlood \n112(8):3339-47, 2008). Increased expression of IL-21 receptor has been shown in epidermis in patients with systemic sclerosis (Distler et al., \nArthritis \n& \nRheumatism \n52:865-864, 2004) and rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (Jungel et al., \nArthritis \n& \nRheumatism \n50:1468-1476, 2004). Moreover, autoimmune, diabetic NOD mice have increased IL-21 receptor expression (King et al., \nCell \n117:265-277, 2004.) It has been shown that IgG and IL-21 expression is increased in the BXSB-Yaa mouse model which develop an autoimmune lupus erythematosus-like disease (Ozaki et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n173:5361-5371, 2004); IL-21 expression is higher in lupus-prone sanroque mice (Vinuesa et al. \nNature \n435:452, 2005); IL-21 expression is higher in inflamed vs uninflamed gut tissues from patients with Crohn's disease (Monteleone, et al., \nGastroenterology \n128:687-694, 2005). IL-21 is also overproduced in the mucosa of celiac disease patients (Finn et al. \nGut, PMID: \n17965065, 2007).\n\n\nA therapeutically effective amount of an anti-IL-21 antibody and/or an antibody to a second antigen refers to an amount of antibody which when administered to a subject is effective to prevent, delay, reduce or inhibit a symptom or biological activity associated with a disease of disorder. Administration may consist of a single dose or multiple doses and may be given in combination with other pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\nThe present invention provides compositions and methods for using anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies as well as bispecific antibodies comprising those antibodies in inflammatory and immune diseases or conditions such as psoriasis, pancreatitis, type I diabetes (IDDM), Graves' Disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, reactive arthritis, enteropathic arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, autoimmune myocarditis, Kawasaki disease, celiac disease, uveitis, Behcet's disease, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, inflammatory muscle disease (polymyositis, dermatomyositis), microscopic polyangiitis, autoimmune aplastic anemia, autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wegener's syndrome, diverticulosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, scleroderma, systemic sclerosis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, graft vs. host disease (GVHD), cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), Sjogren's syndrome, glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, autoimmune nephritis, pemphigus vulgaris, myasthenia gravis, autoimmune hearing loss, neuromyelitis optica, Goodpasture's syndrome, cryoglobulinemia, Guillain Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), transplant rejection, highly sensitized transplant patients, anti-phospholipid syndrome, allergy, and asthma, and other autoimmune diseases. The present invention provides compositions and methods for using anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies in the therapy for certain immune cell cancers such as multiple myeloma, acute T-cell leukemia, or Hodgkin's Lymphoma.\n\n\nContact Dermatitis\n\n\nAllergic contact dermatitis is defined as a T cell mediated immune reaction to an antigen that comes into contact with the skin. The CLA+ T cell population is believed to be involved in the initiation of dermatitis since allergen dependent T cell responses are largely confined to the CLA+ population of cells (See Santamaria-Babi, et al., \nJ Exp Med \n181:1935, (1995)). Recent data have found that only memory (CD45RO+) CD4+ CLA+ and not CD8+ T cells proliferate and produce both type-1 (IFN-γ) and type-2 (IL-5) cytokines in response to nickel, a common contact hypersensitivity allergen. Furthermore, cells expressing CLA in combination with CD4, CD45RO (memory) or CD69 are increased after nickel-specific stimulation and express the chemokine receptors CXCR3, CCR4, CCR10 but not CCR6. See Moed et al., \nBr J Dermatol \n51:32, (2004).\n\n\nIn animal models, it has been demonstrated that allergic contact dermatitis is T cell-dependent and that the allergic-responsive T cells migrate to the site of allergen application. See generally: Engeman, et al., \nJ Immunol \n164:5207, (2000); Ferguson & Kupper, \nJ Immunol \n150:1172, (1993); and Gorbachev & Fairchild, \nCrit Rev Immunol. \n21:451(2001).\n\n\nAdministration anti-IL-21 antibodies to mousse models of contact hypersensitivity is used to evaluate the clinical utility of anti-IL-21 antibodies to ameliorate symptoms and alter the course of disease. The addition of a second antibody to an antigen known to be involved in contact dermatitis can be used. A bispecific antibody is particularly preferred if addition of the second antigen increases efficacy of the treatment and/or increases specificity of the antibody binding.\n\n\nAtopic Dermatitis\n\n\nAtopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease with a dramatically increasing incidence over the last decades. Clinically AD is characterized by highly pruritic, often excoriated, plaques and papules that show a chronic relapsing course. The diagnosis of AD is mostly based on major and minor clinical findings. See Hanifin J. M., \nArch Dermatol \n135:1551 (1999). Histopathology reveals spongiosis, hyperparakeratosis and focal parakeratosis in acute lesions, whereas marked epidermal hyperplasia with hyperparakeratosis and parakeratosis, acanthosis/hypergranulosis and perivascular infiltration of the dermis with lymphocytes and abundant mast cells are the hallmarks of chronic lesions.\n\n\nT cells play a central role in the initiation of local immune responses in tissues and evidence suggests that skin-infiltrating T cells in particular, may play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of disregulated immune responses in the skin. Approximately 90% of infiltrating T cells in cutaneous inflammatory sites express the cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen which binds E-selectin, an inducible adhesion molecule on endothelium (reviewed in Santamaria-Babi, et al., \nEur J Dermatol \n14: 13, (2004)). A significant increase in circulating CLA+ T cells among AD patients compared with control individuals has been documented (See Teraki, et al., \nBr J Dermatol \n143:373 (2000), while others have demonstrated that memory CLA+ T cells from AD patients preferentially respond to allergen extract compared to the CLA− population (See Santamaria-Babi, L. F., et al., \nJ Exp Med. \n181:1935, (1995)). In humans, the pathogenesis of atopic disorders of the skin have been associated with increases in CLA+ T cells that express increased levels of Th-2-type cytokines like IL-5 and IL-13. See Akdis et al., \nEur J Immunol \n30:3533 (2000); and Hamid et al., \nJ Allergy Clin Immunol \n98: 225 (1996).\n\n\nNC/Nga mice spontaneously develop AD-like lesions that parallel human AD in many aspects, including clinical course and signs, histopathology and immunopathology when housed in non-specified pathogen-free (non-SPF) conditions at around 6-8 weeks of age. In contrast, NC/Nga mice kept under SPF conditions do not develop skin lesions. However, onset of spontaneous skin lesions and scratching behaviour can be synchronized in NC/Nga mice housed in a SPF facility by weekly intradermal injection of crude dust mite antigen. See Matsuoka et al., \nAllergy \n58:139 (2003). Therefore, the development of AD in NC/Nga is a useful model for the evaluation of novel therapeutics for the treatment of AD.\n\n\nIn addition to the NC/Nga model of spontaneous AD, epicutaneous sensitization of mice using OVA can also be used as a model to induce antigen-dependent epidermal and dermal thickening with a mononuclear infiltrate in skin of sensitized mice. This usually coincides with elevated serum levels of total and specific IgE, however no skin barrier dysfunction or pruritus normally occurs in this model. See Spergel et al., \nJ Clin Invest, \n101:1614, (1998). This protocol can be modified in order to induce skin barrier disregulation and pruritis by sensitizing DO11.10 OVA TCR transgenic mice with OVA. Increasing the number of antigen-specific T cells that could recognize the sensitizing antigen may increase the level of inflammation in the skin to induce visible scratching behaviour and lichenification/scaling of the skin.\n\n\nAdministration of anti-IL-21 antibodies to mouse models of atopic dermatitis is used to evaluate the clinical utility of anti-IL-21 antibodies to ameliorate symptoms and alter the course of disease. The addition of a second antibody to an antigen known to be involved in atopic dermatitis can be used. A bispecific antibody is particularly preferred if addition of the second antigen increases efficacy of the treatment and/or increases specificity of the antibody binding\n\n\nArthritis\n\n\nArthritis, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, arthritic joints as a result of injury, and the like, are common inflammatory conditions which would benefit from the therapeutic use of anti-inflammatory antibodies and binding polypeptides. For example, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic disease that affects the entire body and is one of the most common forms of arthritis. It is characterized by the inflammation of the membrane lining the joint, which causes pain, stiffness, warmth, redness and swelling. Inflammatory cells release enzymes that may digest bone and cartilage. As a result of rheumatoid arthritis, the inflamed joint lining, the synovium, can invade and damage bone and cartilage leading to joint deterioration and severe pain amongst other physiologic effects. The involved joint can lose its shape and alignment, resulting in pain and loss of movement.\n\n\nRheumatoid Arthritis\n\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immune-mediated disease particularly characterized by inflammation and subsequent tissue damage leading to severe disability and increased mortality. A variety of cytokines are produced locally in the rheumatoid joints. Numerous studies have demonstrated that IL-1 and TNF-alpha, two prototypic pro-inflammatory cytokines, play an important role in the mechanisms involved in synovial inflammation and in progressive joint destruction. Indeed, the administration of TNF-alpha and IL-1 inhibitors in patients with RA has led to a dramatic improvement of clinical and biological signs of inflammation and a reduction of radiological signs of bone erosion and cartilage destruction. However, despite these encouraging results, a significant percentage of patients do not respond to these agents, suggesting that other mediators are also involved in the pathophysiology of arthritis (Gabay, \nExpert. Opin. Biol. Ther. \n2(2):135-149, 2002).\n\n\nThere are several animal models for rheumatoid arthritis known in the art. For example, in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model, mice develop chronic inflammatory arthritis that closely resembles human rheumatoid arthritis. Since CIA shares similar immunological and pathological features with RA, this makes it an ideal model for screening potential human anti-inflammatory compounds. The CIA model is a well-known model in mice that depends on both an immune response, and an inflammatory response, in order to occur. The immune response comprises the interaction of B-cells and CD4+ T-cells in response to collagen, which is administered as antigen, and leads to the production of anti-collagen antibodies. The inflammatory phase is the result of tissue responses from mediators of inflammation, as a consequence of some of these antibodies cross-reacting to the mouse's native collagen and activating the complement cascade. An advantage in using the CIA model is that the basic mechanisms of pathogenesis are known. The relevant T-cell and B-cell epitopes on type H collagen have been identified, and various immunological (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity and anti-collagen antibody) and inflammatory (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, and matrix-degrading enzymes) parameters relating to immune-mediated arthritis have been determined, and can thus be used to assess test compound efficacy in the CIA model (Wooley, \nCurr. Opin. Rheum. \n3:407-20, 1999; Williams et al., \nImmunol. \n89:9784-788, 1992; Myers et al., \nLife Sci. \n61:1861-78, 1997; and Wang et al., \nImmunol. \n92:8955-959, 1995).\n\n\nThe administration of anti-IL-21 antibodies to these CIA model mice is used to evaluate the use of anti-IL-21 antibodies to ameliorate symptoms and alter the course of disease. The addition of a second antibody to an antigen known to be involved in arthritis (or rheumatoid arthritis) can be used. A bispecific antibody is particularly preferred if addition of the second antigen increases efficacy of the treatment and/or increases specificity of the antibody binding.\n\n\nInflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)\n\n\nIn the United States approximately 500,000 people suffer from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which can affect either colon and rectum (ulcerative colitis) or both, small and large intestine (Crohn's Disease). The pathogenesis of these diseases is unclear, but they involve chronic inflammation of the affected tissues. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine, commonly called the colon, characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the mucosa or innermost lining of the colon. This inflammation causes the colon to empty frequently, resulting in diarrhea. Symptoms include loosening of the stool and associated abdominal cramping, fever and weight loss. Although the exact cause of UC is unknown, recent research suggests that the body's natural defenses are operating against proteins in the body which the immune systems thinks are “non-self” (an “autoimmune reaction”). Perhaps because they resemble bacterial proteins in the gut, these proteins may either instigate or stimulate the inflammatory process that begins to destroy the lining of the colon. As the lining of the colon is destroyed, ulcers form releasing mucus, pus and blood. The disease usually begins in the rectal area and may eventually extend through the entire large bowel. Repeated episodes of inflammation lead to thickening of the wall of the intestine and rectum with scar tissue. Death of colon tissue or sepsis may occur with severe disease. The symptoms of ulcerative colitis vary in severity and their onset may be gradual or sudden. Attacks may be provoked by many factors, including respiratory infections or stress.\n\n\nAlthough there is currently no cure for UC available, treatments are focused on suppressing the abnormal inflammatory process in the colon lining. Treatments including corticosteroids immunosuppressives (eg. azathioprine, mercaptopurine, and methotrexate) and aminosalicytates are available to treat the disease. However, the long-term use of immunosuppressives such as corticosteroids and azathioprine can result in serious side effects including bone-thinning, cataracts, infection, and liver and bone marrow effects. In the patients in whom current therapies are not successful, surgery is an option. However, the surgery involves the removal of the entire colon and the rectum.\n\n\nThere are several animal models that can partially mimic chronic ulcerative colitis. The most widely used model is the 2,4,6-trinitrobenesulfonic acid/ethanol (TNBS) induced colitis model, which induces chronic inflammation and ulceration in the colon. When TNBS is introduced into the colon of susceptible mice via intra-rectal instillation, it induces T-cell mediated immune response in the colonic mucosa, in this case leading to a massive mucosal inflammation characterized by the dense infiltration of T-cells and macrophages throughout the entire wall of the large bowel. Moreover, this histopathologic picture is accompanied by the clinical picture of progressive weight loss (wasting), bloody diarrhea, rectal prolapse, and large bowel wall thickening (Neurath et al. \nIntern. Rev. Immunol. \n19:51-62, 2000). Adoptive transfer of naïve T cells into minor histocompatibility mismatched or syngeneic immunocompromised mice leads to development of colitis (Leach M W et al 1996, Powrie F et al, 1997) as well as skin lesions resembling psoriasis (Schon M P et al., \nNat Med. \n2:183-8, 1997; Davenport C M et al., \nInt Immunopharmacol. \n5:653-72, 2002). Transplantation of as few as 0.2 million CD4+CD25− T cells from BALB/C or B10.D2 mice into immunocompromised C.B-17 SCID mice results in weight loss, hemoccult positive stool and development of skin lesions. The symptoms in these mice vary from colony to colony. This model of colitis/psoriasis has some similarities to human Crohn's disease and psoriasis, and has been used extensively to test efficacy of therapeutics for these diseases in humans.\n\n\nAnother colitis model uses dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), which induces an acute colitis manifested by bloody diarrhea, weight loss, shortening of the colon and mucosal ulceration with neutrophil infiltration. DSS-induced colitis is characterized histologically by infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lamina propria, with lymphoid hyperplasia, focal crypt damage, and epithelial ulceration. These changes are thought to develop due to a toxic effect of DSS on the epithelium and by phagocytosis of lamina propria cells and production of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Despite its common use, several issues regarding the mechanisms of DSS-induced disease and its relevance to the human disease remain unresolved. DSS is regarded as a T cell-independent model because it is observed in T cell-deficient animals such as SCID mice.\n\n\nThe administration of anti-IL-21 antibodies to these TNBS, DSS or CD4+ T cell-transfer models can be used to evaluate the use of IL-21 antagonists to ameliorate symptoms and alter the course of gastrointestinal disease. IL-21 may play a role in the inflammatory response in colitis, and the neutralization of IL-21 activity by administrating IL-21 antagonists is a potential therapeutic approach for IBD. The addition of a second antibody to an antigen known to be involved in inflammatory bowel disease can be used. A bispecific antibody is particularly preferred if addition of the second antigen increases efficacy of the treatment and/or increases specificity of the antibody binding.\n\n\nPsoriasis\n\n\nPsoriasis is a chronic skin condition that affects more than seven million Americans. Psoriasis occurs when new skin cells grow abnormally, resulting in inflamed, swollen, and scaly patches of skin where terminal differentiation of keratinocytes is altered. Plaque psoriasis, the most common form, is characterized by inflamed patches of skin (“lesions”) topped with silvery white scales. Psoriasis may be limited to a few plaques or involve moderate to extensive areas of skin, appearing most commonly on the scalp, knees, elbows and trunk. Although it is highly visible, psoriasis is not a contagious disease. The pathogenesis of the diseases involves T cell activation, altered antigen presentation and cytokine production by inflammatory dendritic cells, and chronic inflammation of the affected tissues. Anti-IL-21 antibodies of the present invention, could serve as a valuable therapeutic to reduce inflammation and pathological effects in psoriasis, other inflammatory skin diseases, skin and mucosal allergies, and related diseases.\n\n\nPsoriasis is a T-cell mediated inflammatory disorder of the skin that can cause considerable discomfort. It is a disease for which there is no cure and affects people of all ages. Psoriasis affects approximately two percent of the populations of European and North America. Although individuals with mild psoriasis can often control their disease with topical agents, more than one million patients worldwide require ultraviolet light treatments or systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Unfortunately, the inconvenience and risks of ultraviolet radiation and the toxicities of many therapies limit their long-term use. Moreover, patients usually have recurrence of psoriasis, and in some cases rebound, shortly after stopping immunosuppressive therapy. Anti-IL-21 antibodies can be tested using a recently developed a model of psoriasis based on the CD4+CD45RB transfer model (Davenport et al., \nInternat. Immunopharmacol., \n2:653-672, 2002).\n\n\nIn addition to other disease models described herein, the activity of anti-IL-21 antibodies on inflammatory tissue derived from human psoriatic lesions can be measured in vivo using a severe combined immune deficient (SCID) based mouse model. Several mouse models have been developed in which human cells or tissue grafts are implanted into immunodeficient mice (collectively referred to as xenograft models); see, for example, Cattan and Douglas, \nLeuk. Res. \n18:513-22, 1994 and Flavell, \nHematological Oncology \n14:67-82, 1996. As an in vivo xenograft model for psoriasis, human psoriatic skin tissue is grafted onto SCID mice, and the mice are subsequently challenged with an appropriate antagonist. Moreover, other psoriasis animal models in the art may be used to evaluate IL-21 antagonists, such as human psoriatic skin grafts implanted into the AGR129 mouse model, and challenged with an appropriate antagonist (e.g., see, Boyman et al., \nJ. Exp. Med. Online publication #\n20031482, 2004). Similarly, tissues or cells derived from human colitis, IBD, arthritis, or other inflammatory lesions can be used in the SCID model to assess the anti-inflammatory properties of the anti-IL-21 antibodies described herein.\n\n\nEfficacy of treatment is measured and statistically evaluated as increased anti-inflammatory effect within the treated population over time using methods well known in the art. Some exemplary methods include, but are not limited to measuring for example, in a psoriasis model, epidermal thickness, the number of inflammatory cells in the upper dermis, and the grades of parakeratosis. Such methods are known in the art and described herein. For example, see Zeigler et al., \nLab Invest \n81:1253, 2001; Zollner et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n109:671, 2002; Yamanaka et al., \nMicrobiol. Immunol. \n45:507, 2001; Raychaudhuri et al., \nBr. J. Dermatol. \n144:931, 2001; Boehncke et al., \nArch. Dermatol. Res. \n291:104, 1999; Boehncke et al., \nJ. Invest. Dermatol. \n116:596, 2001; Nickoloff et al., \nAm. J. Pathol. \n146:580, 1995; Boehncke et al., \nJ. Cutan. Pathol. \n24:1, 1997; Sugai et al., \nJ. Dermatol. Sci. \n17:85, 1998; and Villadsen et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n112:1571, 2003. Inflammation may also be monitored over time using well-known methods such as flow cytometry (or PCR) to quantitate the number of inflammatory or lesional cells present in a sample, score (weight loss, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, colon length) for IBD, paw disease score and inflammation score for CIA RA model.\n\n\nThe administration of anti-IL-21 antibodies to these psoriasis model mice is used to evaluate the use of anti-IL-21 antibodies to ameliorate symptoms and alter the course of disease. The addition of a second antibody to an antigen known to be involved in psoriasis can be used. A bispecific antibody is particularly preferred if addition of the second antigen increases efficacy of the treatment and/or increases specificity of the antibody binding.\n\n\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus\n\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an immune-complex related disorder characterized by chronic IgG antibody production directed at ubiquitous self antigens (e.g. anti-dsDNA). The effects of SLE are systemic, rather than localized to a specific organ, although glomerulonephritis may result in some cases (i.e. lupus nephritis). Multiple chromosomal loci have been associated with the disease and may contribute towards different aspects of the disease, such as anti-dsDNA antibodies and glomerulonephritis. CD4+ T cells have been shown to play an active part in mouse models of SLE (Horwitz, \nLupus \n10:319-320, 2001; Yellin and Thienel, \nCurr. Rheumatol. Rep., \n2:24-37, 2000). The role for CD8+ T cells is not clearly defined, but there is evidence to suggest that “suppressor” CD8+ T cell function is impaired in lupus patients (Filaci et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n166:6452-6457, 2001; Sakane et al, \nJ. Immunol., \n137:3809-3813, 1986).\n\n\nIL-21 has been convincingly shown to induce the differentiation of naïve human B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells (Ozaki et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n173:5361, 2004; Ettinger et al., \nJ Immunol. \n175:7867-79, 2005; Ettinger et al, \nJ. Immunol. \n178:2872-82, 2007; Kuchen et al. \nJ Immunol. \n179:5886-96, 2007). Ozaki et al., (\nJ. Immunol. \n173:5361, 2004) also demonstrated that IL-21 expression is elevated in lupus-prone BXSB-Yaa mice, a model for SLE, at an age when the early characteristics of autoimmune processes first become evident. Treatment of these BXSB-Yaa mice with a murine IL-21 antagonist partially inhibits various disease parameters, including glomerulonephritis (Bubier et al., \nAnn N Y Acad Sci. \n1110:590-601, 2007). The same IL-21 antagonist has also been shown to be efficacious in another pre-clinical disease model of SLE, the MRL/lpr mouse (Herber et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n178: 3822-3830, 2007). Moreover, because IL-21 limits development of Treg cells, administration of anti-IL-21 antibodies could provide a more robust T cell suppressor function in lupus patients where that function is compromised (Lamprecht et al. \nBlood. \n112(8):3339-47, 2008).\n\n\nData obtained from 24 SLE patients and 15 healthy controls showed that 1) IL-21 mRNA expression is significantly increased in CD4+ T cells from lupus patients compared to controls, 2) IL-21 levels are significantly elevated in sera from patients with active compared to inactive SLE or controls, as determined using a commercial IL-21 ELISA kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), 3) IL-21 enhances CD4+ T cells and CD 19+ B cells proliferation in patients and controls in a dose dependent fashion, 4) IL-21 enhances anti-CD40 induced plasma cell differentiation in normal controls and SLE patients, and 5) elevated levels of IL-21 may contribute to proliferation of autoreactive CD4+ T cells and plasma cell differentiation in SLE ((Rus, V., \nACR Presentation #\n1760, 2008 American College of Rheumatology meeting, Oct. 24-29, 2008).\n\n\nAnti-IL-21 antibodies can be administered in combination with other agents already in use in autoimmunity including immune modulators such as IFNγ, NOVANTRONE®, ENBREL®, BETAFERON®, REMICADE®, LEUKINE® and PROLEUKIN®. Anti-IL-21 antibodies can be administered in combination with other agents already in use in the cancer therapy of multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's Lymphoma or acute T-cell leukemia such as THALOMID® or with steroids such as dexamethasone or prednisone. Establishing the optimal dose level and scheduling for anti-IL-21 antibodies is done by a variety of means, including study of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anti-IL-21 antibodies; determination of effective doses in animal models, and evaluation of the toxicity of anti-IL-21 antibodies. Direct pharmacokinetic measurements done in primates and clinical trials can then be used to predict theoretical doses in patients that achieve plasma anti-IL-21 antibody levels that are of sufficient magnitude and duration to achieve a biological response in patients. The addition of a second antibody to an antigen known to be involved in SLE can be used. A bispecific antibody is particularly preferred if addition of the second antigen increases efficacy of the treatment and/or increases specificity of the antibody binding.\n\n\nTransplant Rejection\n\n\nRecipients of transplanted solid organs may develop acute or chronic rejection of the allograft due to histocompatability mismatch. The generation of antibodies directed against the HLA molecules (alloantibodies) in these patients results from presentation of the foreign antigen to T cells. Alloantibodies may mediate tissue damage in the graft through formation of immune complexes, complement fixation, and antibody mediated cellular cytotoxicity directed by bound alloantibodies. The complement cascade also releases local factors that activate endothelial cells and cause vasculopathy within the graft. The complement product C4d is an early marker in both acute and chronic transplant rejection, and can be detected in sub-clinical cases prior to overt pathological changes (Racusen and Haas, \nClin J Am Soc Nephrol \n1: 415-420, 2006; Moll and Pascual, \nAm J Transplantation \n5: 2611-2618, 2005; Tinkam and Chandraker, \nClin J Am Soc Nephrol \n1: 404-414, 2006). Patients are screened for anti-HLA alloantibodies (panel reactive antibody) prior to transplantation. Patients may be highly sensitized due to prior allograft failure, blood transfusions, or multiple pregnancies. The presence of alloantibodies in highly sensitized transplant patients complicates their care, as increased immnosuppressive therapies may be required and the chance of acute rejection is high (Baid et al., \nCurr Opin Immunol \n13:577-581, 2001). In some cases, B cell targeting agents (mycophenolic acid or rituximab) are used, although this therapeutic strategy does not directly target the antibody-secreting plasma cells. Plasmapheresis is also used to reduce circulating immunoglobulin. In all cases, transplant recipients are treated with T cell targeted immunosuppressive agents to reduce the risk of rejection, and may be slowly “weaned” from these regimens as tolerance to the graft is established (Seyfort-Margolis and Turka, \nJ Clin Invest \n118(8): 2684-2685, 2008; Taylor et al., \nCrit Rev Oncol Hematol \n56:23-46, 2005; Amante and Ejercito, \nTransplant Proc \n40: 2274-2280, 2008).\n\n\nDevelopment of antibody secreting plasma cells requires cognate help from CD4 T cells in addition to the specialized microenvirornments that support plasma cell survival (Tarlington et al., \nCurr Opin Immunol \n20:162-169, 2008). Cytokine secretion by activated T cells is necessary for differentiation and survival of plasma cells, and is known to affect the nature of the antibody response and Ig isotype. Models exist to monitor T cell dependent antibody responses in murine and non-human primate species. These methods are well understood by those skilled in the art. Kinetics and magnitude of primary or secondary antibody responses against model peptide antigens such as ovalbumin, tetanus toxoid, sheep red blood cells, or trinitrophenyl modified keyhole limpet hemocyanin are monitored using assays that detect total or antigen-specific antibodies, including IgG sub-types, IgM, IgE, or IgA in serum of treated animals. In some models, affinity maturation of the antibodies can also be monitored. These models may be used to test the effects of therapeutic drugs that alter B cell help by T cells and that block cytokines thought to be important for plasma cell differentiation and survival.\n\n\nStudies of allograft rejection are conducted in many animal species. For example, a renal transplant model in cynomolgus monkeys may represent the effects of chronic alloantibody mediated renal allograft rejection in humans. Allograft tolerizing regimens are performed prior to transplant in some cases. The presence of donor-specific alloantibodies is monitored by flow cytometric analysis of recipient serum with mismatched peripheral blood leukocytes, and deposition of the complement product C4d is detected in biopsies from the renal allograft (Smith et al., \nAm J Transplant \n6:1790-1798, 2006; Smith et al., \nAm J Transplant \n8:1-11, 2008). Acute and chronic transplant models may be conducted in murine species by those skilled in the art.\n\n\nAdministration of anti-IL-21 antibodies in a model of T cell dependent antibody response or a model of allograft rejection is used to evaluate the clinical utility of anti-IL-21 antibodies to reduce alloantibody responses, and ameliorate symptoms of allograft rejection, or as part of the pre-transplant therapeutic or tolerizing regimen for transplant recipients, including highly sensitized transplant patients. The addition of a second antibody to an antigen known to be involved in transplant rejection can be used. A bispecific antibody is particularly preferred if addition of the second antigen increases efficacy of the treatment and/or increases specificity of the antibody binding.\n\n\nThe invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nPreparation of IL-21 Proteins and Antibodies\n\n\nA. Immunizations and Hybridomas\n\n\nIL-21 protein was produced as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,250,274, incorporated in its entirety herein. Soluble IL-21 receptor proteins were produced as described in U.S. Patent Application 2007-0122413 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,777,539, both incorporated in their entirety herein. Anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies were produced in wild type mice generating murine antibodies and in transgenic mice generating fully human antibodies (Medarex, Princeton N.J.). Mice were immunized with human IL-21 protein. Briefly, the mice were initially immunized by subcutaneous injection with 30 μg of purified recombinant IL-21 (produced in \nE. coli \nat ZymoGenetics) conjugated with BSA (Imject Pharmalink Immunogen Kit, Pierce) and administered in combination with CpG (oligonucleotide murine TLR9 ligand and GM-CSF (Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulatory Factor, R&D, Minneapolis, Minn.) and Emulsigen®-P adjuvant (MVP Laboratories, INC, Omaha, Nebr.) as per manufacturer's instructions. Following the initial immunization, each of the mice received three additional 30 μg of IL-21 in Emulsigen®-P adjuvant via the subcutaneous route in weekly intervals. Seven days after the fourth immunization the mice were bled via the retro orbital plexus and the serum separated from the blood for analysis of its ability to bind to IL-21.\n\n\nSplenocytes were harvested and pooled from two high-titer BALB/c mice or transgenic mice and fused to P3-X63-Ag8.653 mouse myeloma cells using PEG 1450 in a single fusion procedure (2:1 fusion ratio, splenocytes to myeloma cells, “Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual”, E. Harlow and D. Lane, Cold Spring Harbor Press). Following 9 days growth post-fusion, specific antibody-producing hybridoma pools were identified by Direct and Capture ELISA using recombinant IL-21 protein, untagged and human IgG Fc tagged, as specific antibody target. Positive hybridoma pools were analyzed further for their ability to block the Ligand to receptor binding, which is measured as the level of STAT3-phosphorylafion following ligand-receptor interaction (“phosphor-STAT3 neutralization assay”) of purified recombinant IL-21 protein on BaF3 cells expressing the IL-21 receptor sequence. Monoclonal antibodies purified from tissue culture media were characterized for their ability to block the ligand-receptor interaction (“phosphor-STAT3 neutralization assay”) of purified recombinant IL-21 on Baf3 cells expressing the receptor sequences. “Neutralizing” monoclonal antibodies were identified in this manner.\n\n\nHybridoma pools yielding positive results by the “phosphor-STAT3 neutralization assay” and ELISA formats were cloned at least two times by limiting dilution. In these assays, samples were titrated using standard low density dilution (less than one cell per well) to see which clone will maintain the highest OD reading. Using the results from both the neutralization and titration assays, two specific clones from each initial master well were selected for further analysis. These are subjected to an additional round of cloning to ensure culture homogeneity and screened using the Direct ELISA. After one additional titration assay, two final IL-21 clones were selected. Hybridoma clones were cultured in a growth medium of 90% Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's medium with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 μg/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin sulfate, and 10% Fetal Clone I Serum (Hyclone Laboratories). The clones were propagated by seeding cultures at 2×10\n5 \ncells/ml and maintaining between 1×10\n5 \nand 5×10\n5 \ncell/ml at 37° C. and 5-6% CO\n2\n. Cells were adapted to serum free conditions upon subsequent transfers. Cells are frozen in 90% serum, 10% DMSO and stored in vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freezer.\n\n\nThe purified monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma clones were characterized in a number of ways including binning (i.e, determining if each antibody could inhibit the binding of any other antibody), epitope mapping using peptides, relative affinity, and neutralization.\n\n\nMethods for producing heterologous antibodies from transgenic mice are known, see for example, Lonberg, \nNat. Biotech. \n23(9):1117-25, 2005; Tomizuka et al. \nPNAS \n97(2):722-727, 2000; and U.S. Pat.

of Clone 362.78.1.44 Immunoglobulin Heavy and Light Chain Genes in a Mammalian Cell Line to Produce 362.78-CHO\n\n\n\nHuman anti-human IL-21 monoclonal antibody (derived from hybridoma clone 362.78.1.44) was expressed in CHO cells using two expression cassettes. The VH chain was fused to a modified human IgG1 constant region. The modified IgG1, IgG1.1, contained five amino acid substitutions to reduce effector functions. The human anti-human IL-21 heavy chain was linked to a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) selectable marker with an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) sequence. The expression of the human anti-human IL-21 heavy chain and the DHFR selectable marker were directed by a constitutive synthetic promoter consisting of a fusion of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer and the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV) enhancer/promoter. The simian virus 40 (SV40) polyadenylation signal was used to terminate transcription at the end of the DHFR selectable marker. The VL chain was fused to the human immunoglobulin kappa constant region. The human anti-human IL-21 light chain was linked to a puromycin resistance (puroR) selectable marker with an IRES sequence. The expression of the human anti-human IL-21 light chain and the puroR selectable marker were directed by a constitutive synthetic promoter consisting of a fusion of the human CMV enhancer and the MPSV enhancer/promoter. The SV40 polyadenylation signal was used to terminate transcription at the end of the puroR selectable marker. The human anti-human IL-21 heavy and light chain expression cassettes were co-transfected into CHO DXB-11 host cells. Puromycin selection was followed by methotrexate selection to obtain high, stable expression of human anti-human IL-21 monoclonal antibody. The CHO-expressed version of IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 will be referred to in subsequent Examples as “362.78-CHO.”\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nAnti-IL-21 Monoclonal Antibodies Bind Human IL-21 Proteins and Peptides\n\n\n2A.

Plates were incubated overnight at 4° C. after which unbound protein was aspirated and the plates washed twice with 300 μL/well of Wash Buffer (PBS-Tween defined as 0.137M NaCl, 0.0022M KCl, 0.0067M Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.0020M KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.05% v/\nw polysorbate\n 20, pH 7.2). Wells were blocked with 200 μL/well of Blocking Buffer (PBS-Tween plus 1% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA)) for 1 hour, after which the plates were washed twice with Wash Buffer. Antibody dilutions were prepared in 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS)/Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Media (IMDM) medium and adjusted to 1 μg/ml. Duplicate samples of each antibody dilution were then transferred to the assay plates, 100 μL/well, in order to bind anti-human IL-21 proteins. Following 1 hour incubation at ambient temperature, the wells were aspirated and the plates washed twice as described above. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled Goat anti Mouse IgG, Fc specific or Goat anti Rat IgG, Fc specific, or Goat anti Human IgG, Fc specific (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.) at a dilution of 1:5000 with 5% FBS/IMDM medium was then added to each well, 100 μL/well, and the plates incubated at ambient temperature for 1 hour. After removal of unbound HRP conjugated antibody, the plates were washed five times, 100 μL/well of tetra methyl benzidine (TMB) (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.) added to each well and the plates incubated for 3 minutes at ambient temperature. Color development was stopped by the addition of 100 μL/well of 450 nm TMB Stop Reagent (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.) and the absorbance values of the wells read on a Molecular Devices Spectra MAX 340 instrument at 450 nm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonoclonal mouse anti-human IL-21 antibody reactivity to human IL-21 protein,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmutant human IL-21 protein and human IL-21 sequence derived peptides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse Anti-\n\n\nBinding (B)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nhuman IL-21\n\n\nNeutralizing\n\n\nPurified\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIL-21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAb Clone #\n\n\n(N) Isotype\n\n\nAb Lot#\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\n \nPeptide\n 1\n\n\n \nPeptide\n 2\n\n\n \nPeptide\n 3\n\n\nPeptide 4\n\n\nmutant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.5.4\n\n\nB/N\n\n\nE10274\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.11.5\n\n\nB\n\n\nE10276\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.14.3\n\n\nB\n\n\nE10273\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.15.5\n\n\nB\n\n\nE10275\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.28.6\n\n\nB\n\n\nE10329\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.39.5\n\n\nB\n\n\nE10330\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactivity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeak (+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModerate (++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong (+++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal human anti-human IL-21 antibody reactivity to human IL-21 protein,\n \n \n \nmutant human IL-21 protein and human IL-21 sequence derived peptides\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHuman Anti-\n \nBinding(B)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhuman IL-21\n \n \nNeutralizing\n \n \nPurified\n \n \n \nPeptide\n \n 1\n \n \n \n \n \nPeptide 4\n \nIL-21\n \n \n \nAb Clone #\n \n(N) Isotype\n \nAb Lot#\n \nIL-21\n \nN-\nTerm\n \n \nPeptide\n \n 2\n \nPeptide 3\n \nC-Term\n \nmutant\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n362.75.1.1\n \nB/N\n \nE10364\n \n+++\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n+++\n \n0\n \n \n \n \n \nIgG\n \n \n \n362.78.1.44\n \nB/N\n \nE10554\n \n++\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n+\n \n \n \n \n \nIgG\n \n \n \n362.597.3\n \nB/N\n \nE10366\n \n+++\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n++\n \n \n \n \n \nIgG\n \n \n \n366.328.10\n \nB/N\n \nE10416\n \n+++\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n+++\n \n \n \n \n \nIgG\n \n \n \n366.345.6.11\n \nB\n \nE10476\n \n+++\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n++\n \n \n \n \n \nIgG\n \n \n \n366.552.11\n \nB/N\n \nE10435\n \n+++\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n++\n \n0\n \n \n \n \n \nIgG\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReactivity:\n \n \n \nNone (0)\n \n \n \nWeak (+)\n \n \n \nModerate (++)\n \n \n \nStrong (+++)\n \n \n \n \n \n\n2B Measurement of the Binding Affinities of Anti-Human IL-21 Monoclonal Antibody 362.78-CHO to Human IL-21 and Cynomolgus Monkey IL-21 by Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore)\n\n\n\nThe anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody 362.78-CHO was evaluated for its binding affinity to human recombinant IL-21 and cynomolgus recombinant IL-21 using surface plasmon resonance.\n\n\nAffinity Determination: Kinetic rate constants and equilibrium dissociation constants were measured for the interaction of the anti-human IL-21 monoclonal antibody 362.78-CHO with human IL-21 and cynomolgus IL-21 via surface plasmon resonance. The association rate constant (k\na\n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)) is a value that reflects the rate of the antigen-antibody complex formation. The dissociation rate constant (k\nd\n(s\n−1\n)) is a value that reflects the stability of this complex. By dividing the dissociation rate constant by the association rate constant (k\nd\n/k\na\n) the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n(M)) is obtained. This value describes the binding affinity of the interaction. Antibodies with similar K\nD \ncan have widely variable association and dissociation rate constants. Consequently, measuring both the k\na \nand k\nd \nof antibodies helps to more uniquely describe the affinity of the antibody-antigen interaction.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods: Binding kinetics and affinity studies were performed on a Biacore T100™ system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Methods for the Biacore T100™ were programmed using BIACORE T100™ Control Software, v 1.1.1. For these experiments, the 362.78-CHO antibody was either captured onto a CM4 sensor chip via a goat anti-human IgG Fc-gamma antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa.), or it was minimally biotinylated with a 1:100 mass ratio of Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) in a buffer of PBS pH 7.4 then captured onto a streptavidin (SA) chip. All binding experiments were performed at 25° C. in a buffer of 10 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.05% Surfactant P20 (Biacore), 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0.\n\n\nFor the experiments with the goat anti-human IgG Fc-gamma antibody, the capture antibody was diluted to concentration of 50 μg/mL in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, and then covalently immobilized to all four flow cells of a CM4 sensor chip using amine coupling chemistry (EDC:NHS). After immobilization of the antibody, the remaining active sites on the flow cell were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine. A capture antibody density of approximately 3500 RU was obtained. The anti-IL-21 antibody 362.78-CHO was captured onto \n \nflow cell\n \n 2, 3, and 4 of the CM4 chip at three different densities (ranging from 25 to 150 RU). Capture of the 362.78-CHO antibody to the immobilized surface was performed at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. The Biacore instrument measures the mass of protein bound to the sensor chip surface, and thus, capture of the test antibody was verified for each cycle. Serial dilutions of human recombinant IL-21 or cynomolgus recombinant IL-21 (ZymoGenetics) were prepared from 40 nM-0.003 nM (1:5 serial dilutions). The serial dilutions were injected over the surface and allowed to specifically bind to the 362.78-CHO antibody captured on the sensor chip. Duplicate injections of each IL-21 antigen concentration were performed with an association time of either 6.5 or 7 minutes and dissociation time of either 10, 15, or 60 minutes. Kinetic binding studies were performed with a flow rate of 50 μL/min. In between cycles, the flow cell was washed with 20 mM hydrochloric acid to regenerate the surface. This wash step removed both the captured test antibody and any bound antigen from the immobilized antibody surface. The 362.78-CHO antibody was subsequently captured again in the next cycle.\n\n\nFor the experiments with the minimally biotinylated 362.78-CHO, the biotinylated antibody was captured onto \n \nflow cell\n \n 2, 3, and 4 of the SA chip at three different densities (ranging from 150 to 1200 RU). Capture of the biotinylated-362.78-CHO antibody to the surface was performed at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. Serial dilutions of human recombinant IL-21 or cynomolgus recombinant IL-21 (ZymoGenetics) were prepared either from 50 nM-0.001 nM (1:4 serial dilutions) or from 40 nM-0.003 nM (1:5 serial dilutions). These serial dilutions were injected over the surface and allowed to specifically bind to the 362.78-CHO antibody captured on the sensor chip. Duplicate injections of each IL-21 antigen concentration were performed with an association time of either 6.5 or 7 minutes and dissociation time of either 10, 15, or 60 minutes. Kinetic binding studies were performed with a flow rate of 50 μL/min. In between cycles, the flow cell was washed with 20 mM hydrochloric acid to regenerate the surface. This wash step removed any bound antigen from the immobilized antibody surface. The wash cycle did not remove the biotinylated 362.78-CHO antibody from the sensor surface, and the antibody was subsequently available to bind the next antigen sample.\n\n\nData was compiled using the BIACORE T100™ Evaluation software (version 1.1.1). Data was processed by subtracting reference flow cell and blank injections. Baseline stability was assessed to ensure that the regeneration step provided a consistent binding surface throughout the sequence of injections. Duplicate injection curves were checked for reproducibility. Based on the binding of the monovalent IL-21 to a bivalent antibody, the 1:1 binding interaction model was determined to be appropriate. The reference-subtracted binding curves from three flow cells (FC2-1, FC3-1, FC4-1) were globally fit to the 1:1 binding model with a multiple Rmax and with the RI set to zero. The data fit well to the 1:1 binding model with good agreement between the experimental and theoretical binding curves. The chi\n2 \nand standard errors associated the fits were low. There was no trending in the residuals.\n\n\nResults: For the interaction of 362.78-CHO with human IL-21, data was compiled from four separate experiments. The k\na \nof the multiple experiments ranged from 3E+07 to 5+07 (M\n−1\ns\n−1\n), while the k\nd \nranged from 3E-06 to 3E-05 (s\n−1\n). The calculated K\nD \nranged from 0.9E-13 to 8E-13 (M).\n\n\nFor the interaction of 362.78-CHO with cynomolgus IL-21, data was compiled from three separate experiments. The k\na \nwas 3E+07 (M\n−1\ns\n−1\n) for each experiment, while the k\nd \nranged from 2E-04 to 5E-04 (s\n−1\n). The calculated K\nD \nranged from 0.9E-11 to 2E-11 (M).\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nSpecies Cross Reactivity Experiments\n\n\nDetermination of ability of anti-human IL-21 antibodies to cross-react and bind murine or cynomolgous monkey IL-21 protein or human IL-21 sequence derived synthetic peptides\n\n\nSpecies cross-reactivity studies can be important to demonstrate specificity for therapeutic antagonist development strategies. In order to determine whether the anti-human IL-21 binding and neutralizing entities described herein may cross-react and bind to murine or cynomolgus IL-21 (and therefore, justify the cynomolgus monkey or mouse as a viable test species), it was necessary to demonstrate comparable binding of the antibodies to recombinant human, murine and cynomolgous monkey IL-21 in the various assay formats. One of the methods for testing binding of the monoclonal antibodies is by their performance in immunoblot (Western blot) assays. Recombinant human IL-21 (SEQ ID NO:2), recombinant murine IL-21 (SEQ ID NO:11), recombinant cynomolgus IL-21 (SEQ ID NO:9), human IL-21 sequence derived synthetic peptides: \npeptide #\n1 pyr30-K50 (Seq ID 3), \npeptide #\n2 N54-C71 (Seq ID NO:4), \npeptide #\n3 N97-C122 (Seq ID NO:5), peptide #4 C125-S153 (Seq ID NO:6) conjugated to ovalbumin, or an irrelevant control cytokine, recombinant human IFN-λ (ZymoGenetics) were submitted to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 4-12% BisTris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen, Inc.) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using standard methods and a buffer containing 25 mM Tris, 186 mM glycine and 40% methanol.\n\n\nFor Western blots, the non-specific sites on the membranes were blocked with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% gelatin, and 1% casein hydrolysate blocking solution (Western Blocking Reagent, Roche Diagnostics, Inc., Basel Switerzerland) (Blocking Buffer). The membranes were then incubated for 2 hrs at room temperature with purified monoclonal antibody (10 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml) in the Blocking Buffer followed by a 2 hr incubation with peroxidase conjugated donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Me.). The membranes were washed 5 times with the Tris/EDTA/IGEPAL/NaCl/gelatin Blocking buffer which lacked the casein hydrolysate and developed with SUPERSIGNAL™ DuraWest Luminol/Enhancer/Peroxidase Solution (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) for chemoluminescence detection. The blots were visualized using X-ray film based standard methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonoclonal Human Anti-Human IL-21 Antibody\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactivity in Western Blot Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n+Hu IL-21\n\n\n+Hu IL-21\n\n\n+Hu IL-21\n\n\n+Hu IL-21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHu\n\n\nCyno\n\n\nMu\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone*\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\nA1744\n\n\nA1750\n\n\nA1751\n\n\nA1752\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.35.1.2\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.37.3\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.75.1.1\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.78.1\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.108.1.2\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.172.2\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.216.2\n\n\n0\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.256.1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.303.1.1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.378.1\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.468.3\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.564.1.4\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.597.3\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.632.2\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.328.10\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.342.8\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.345.6.11\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.353.11.12\n\n\n+\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.398.36\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.453.30\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.462.24.10\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.479.13\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.552.11\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.565.7\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.617.7\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.618.20\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n367.752.5\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n368.626.24\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactivity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeak (+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModerate (++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong (+++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*No Signals Observed with IFN-λ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Peptides were Conjugated to Ovalbumin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nEvaluation of the Ability of Anti-Human IL-21 Antibodies to Cross-React and Bind the Human γc-Family Cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, L-9, IL-15\n\n\nAnother important characteristic of a specific antibody is the ability of the antibody to bind to and antagonize the target protein(s) but to not bind related proteins(non-target) to a significant degree. The ability of anti-human IL-21 antibodies to bind to related cytokines was tested in the Western blot format. Samples of all members of the γc-cytokine family were obtained and run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for blotting. Recombinant human IL-2 (202-IL/CF), human IL-4 (204-IL/CF), human IL-7 (207-IL/CF), human IL-9 (209-IL/CF), human IL-15 (247-IL/CF) all obtained from R&D Systems, Minneapolis Minn.), human IL-21 (ZymoGenefics) and human IFN-λ (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,927,040; 7,252,969) were used to evaluate the specificity of the antibodies. All of the antibodies tested showed no detectable binding above background to the γc-family cytokines except for human IL-21 where clear binding was observed, consistent with previous Western blots using these antibodies (see Example 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonoclonal Anti-Human IL-21 Antibody Reactivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto γc cytokines in Western Blot Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIFNλ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHu\n\n\nHu\n\n\nHu\n\n\nHu\n\n\nHu\n\n\nHu\n\n\nnegative\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone\n\n\nIL-2\n\n\nIL-4\n\n\nIL-7\n\n\nIL-9\n\n\nIL-15\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.597.3\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.75.1.1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.78.1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.564.1.4\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.328.10.63\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.552.11.31\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.617.7\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactivity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeak (+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModerate (++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong (+++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonoclonal Mouse and Rat Anti-Human IL-21 Antibody\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactivity in Western Blot Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n+Hu IL-21\n\n\n+Hu IL-21\n\n\n+Hu IL-21\n\n\n+Hu IL-21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHu\n\n\nCyno\n\n\nMu\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone*\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\nIL-21\n\n\nA1744\n\n\nA1750\n\n\nA1751\n\n\nA1752\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse Clones\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.5.4\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.11.5\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.14.3\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.15.5\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.17.3\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.24.5\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.25.6\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.28.6\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.29.2\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338.39.5\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRat Clones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n272.19.1.1.4.2\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n272.21.1.3.4.2\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactivity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeak (+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModerate (++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong (+++)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*No Signals Observed with IFN-λ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Peptides were Conjugated to Ovalbumin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nCompetitive Epitope Binning Studies\n\n\nEpitope binning experiments were performed to determine which anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies are capable of binding simultaneously to human IL-21. Both human and mouse antibodies were represented. Anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies that compete for the same, or an overlapping, binding site (epitope) on the antigen are not able to bind simultaneously and are functionally grouped into a single family or “epitope bin”. Anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies that do not compete for the same binding site on the antigen are able to bind simultaneously and are grouped into separate families or “epitope bins”. Experiments were performed using a BIACORE T100™ instrument. Epitope binning experiments were performed with soluble, (ZymoGenetics) human IL-21 as the antigen.\n\n\nEpitope binning studies were performed on a BIACORE T100™ system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Methods were programmed using BIACORE T100™ Control Software, v 1.1.1. Individual anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies were covalently immobilized to separate flow cells of a BIACORE CM4 sensor chip. Subsequently, the IL-21 antigen was injected and allowed to specifically bind to the monoclonal antibody immobilized on the sensor chip. The BIACORE instrument measures the mass of protein bound to the sensor chip surface, and thus, immobilization of the primary antibody of a test pair and specific binding of the IL-21 antigen to the primary antibody were verified for each test cycle. Following the binding of the IL-21 antigen, a secondary anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody was injected and allowed to bind. If the secondary anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody was capable of binding the antigen simultaneously with the primary monoclonal antibody, an increase in mass on the surface of the chip, or binding, was detected. If, however, the secondary anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody was not capable of binding the antigen simultaneously with the primary monoclonal antibody, no additional mass, or binding, was detected. Each anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody tested against itself was used as the negative control to establish the level of the background (no-binding) signal.\n\n\nA series of experiments was completed to test the binding properties of purified anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies obtained from hydridoma fusions of the spleens of mice immune to human IL-21. The first anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody of a test pair was covalently immobilized using EDC:NHS to a density of approximately 1000 RU. The IL-21 antigen was diluted to 100 nM and allowed to flow over the surface of the immobilized antibody. Subsequently, the secondary antibody of a test pair was diluted to 5 μg/mL (approximately 32.2 nM) and allowed to bind to the captured IL-21 antigen. A subset of the anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies was tested as the primary antibody in combination with the full panel of secondary anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies. Binding experiments were performed with a flow rate of 30 μL/min at 25° C. The buffer for these studies consisted of 10 mM Hepes, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.05% surfactant P20, 5 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0. Between cycles, the antibody on the chip was regenerated with 20 mM hydrochloric acid. Data was compiled using BIACORE T100™ Evaluation software (version 1.1.1), then loaded into EXCEL™ for additional data processing.\n\n\nPurified anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies were characterized and assigned into epitope bins. The signal (RU, response units) reported by the BIACORE is directly correlated to the mass on the sensor chip surface. Once the level of background signal (RU) associated with the negative controls was established (the same anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody used as both the primary and secondary antibody), the binning results were reported as either positive or negative binding. Positive binding indicates that two different anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies are capable of binding the antigen simultaneously. Negative binding indicates that two different anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies are not capable of binding the antigen simultaneously. The differential between positive and negative response values in this experiment was significant and allowed for an unambiguous assignment of the anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies into six distinct families, or epitope bins. The first epitope bin was represented by anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies from, for example, clones 338.5.4; 362.78.1; and 362.597.3. The second bin was represented by anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies from, for example, clones 338.14.3; 362.75.1.1; and 366.328.10. An additional third bin was found to overlap the binding epitopes of the \nbin #\n1 and \nbin #\n2 antibodies. It was represented by monoclonal antibody from, for example, clone 366.552.11. Antibodies that neutralize IL-21 are found in each of these three bins.\n\n\nThree additional epitope bins were identified. Each of these bins was represented by monoclonal antibody from, for example, hybridoma clones 366.345.6.11 (bin #4), 338.28.6 (bin#5), and 338.39.5 (bin#6). The antibodies identified in these three bins do not neutralize human IL-21 bioactivity.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nSoluble Receptor Competition Studies\n\n\nCompetition experiments were performed to determine which anti-human IL-21 monoclonal antibodies are capable of binding IL-21 simultaneously with the IL-21 soluble receptor. Anti-human IL-21 monoclonal antibodies that compete with the soluble receptor for the same, or an overlapping, binding site (epitope) on the antigen are not able to bind simultaneously. Anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies that do not compete with the soluble receptor for the same binding site on the antigen are able to bind simultaneously. Competition experiments were performed with soluble, recombinant human IL-21 as the antigen. The IL-21 antigen was allowed to bind the monoclonal antibody prior to competition with the IL-21 soluble receptor. Two versions of the IL-21 soluble receptor (both produced by ZymoGenetics) were utilized for monoclonal antibody analysis in these studies: One version of the receptor consists of a homodimeric receptor (IL-21R-Fc) composed of the extracellular domain of the IL-21 receptor fused to an Fc molecule derived from human immunoglobulin. The second soluble receptor form was a heterodimeric receptor (IL-21R/γc-Fc) composed of one subunit comprising the extracellular domain of the IL-21 receptor fused to an Fc molecule derived from human immunoglobulin and a second subunit comprising the extracellular domain of the common γ common-chain fused to an Fc molecule derived from human immunoglobulin, as described in co-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,777,539 incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\nCompetition studies were performed on a BIACORE T100™ system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Methods were programmed using BIACORE T100™ Control Software, v 1.1.1. Individual anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies were covalently immobilized to separate flow cells of a BIACORE CM4 sensor chip. Subsequently, the IL-21 antigen (SEQ ID NO: 2) was injected and allowed to specifically bind to the monoclonal antibody immobilized on the sensor chip. The Biacore instrument measures the mass of protein bound to the sensor chip surface, and thus, immobilization of the primary antibody and specific binding of the IL-21 antigen to the primary antibody were verified for each test cycle. Following the binding of the IL-21 antigen, the soluble receptor was injected and allowed to bind. If the soluble receptor was capable of binding the antigen simultaneously with the primary monoclonal antibody, an increase in mass on the surface of the chip, or binding, was detected. If, however, the soluble receptor was not capable of binding the antigen simultaneously with the primary monoclonal antibody, no additional mass, or binding, was detected. Each anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody tested against itself was used as the negative control to establish the level of the background (no-binding) signal. As a positive control, each anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody was tested against an anti-IL-21 antibody from a different epitope bin to determine the level of positive (binding) signal.\n\n\nA series of experiments were completed to test the binding properties of 5 purified anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies (from hybridoma clones 362.78.1, 366.75.1.1, 366.328.10, 366.552.11.31, and 366.345.6.11) that bind human IL-21. The first anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody of a test pair was covalently immobilized using a mixture of 0.4 M EDC [N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylamino-propyl)carbodimide] and 0.1 M NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) to a density of approximately 1000 RU. After immobilization of the antibody, the active sites on the flow cell were blocked with 1M ethanolamine. The IL-21 antigen was diluted to 100 nM and allowed to flow over the surface of the immobilized antibody. Subsequently, the soluble receptor was diluted to 10 μg/mL and allowed to bind to the captured IL-21 antigen. Binding experiments were performed with a flow rate of 30 μL/min at 25° C. The buffer for these studies consisted of 10 mM Hepes, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.05% surfactant P20, 5 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0. Between cycles, the flow cell was washed with 20 mM hydrochloric acid to regenerate the surface. This wash step removed the IL-21 antigen and any bound soluble receptor from the immobilized antibody surface, and allowed for the subsequent binding of the next test sample. Data was compiled using BIACORE T100™ Evaluation software (version 1.1.1).\n\n\nPurified anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies were characterized for their ability to compete with the human IL-21 soluble receptor for binding to the IL-21 antigen. The signal (RU, response units) reported by the BIACORE is directly correlated to the mass on the sensor chip surface. Once the level of background signal (RU) associated with the negative controls was established (the same anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody used as both the primary and secondary antibody), the competition results were reported as either positive or negative binding. Positive binding indicates that the anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody and IL-21 soluble receptor are capable of binding the antigen simultaneously. Negative binding indicates that the anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody and the IL-21 soluble receptor are not capable of binding the antigen simultaneously. The differential between positive and negative response values in this experiment was significant and allowed for an unambiguous determination of competition between the anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies and IL-21 soluble receptor.\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies from hybridoma clones 362.78.1 and 366.552.11.31 competed with both versions of the IL-21 soluble receptor (homodimeric IL-21R-Fc and heterodimeric IL-21R/γc-Fc) for binding to the human IL-21 antigen. Monoclonal antibodies from hybridoma clones 366.328.10 and 366.345.6.11 did not compete with either version of the soluble receptor for binding to the antigen. The monoclonal antibody from hybridoma clone 362.75.1.1 showed partial competition for binding with both forms of the soluble receptor. These studies were performed with the IL-21 antigen pre-bound to the monoclonal antibody. Three of these antibodies (362.78.1, 366.328.10, 366.552.11.31) have been shown to neutralize human IL-21 while the monoclonal antibody antibodies from hybridoma clones 362.75.1.1 and 366.345.6.11 are, depending on the assay, very weak, or non-neutralizers of human IL-21 bioactivity.\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nIL-21 Baf3/huIL-21R STAT3 Bioactivity Assay\n\n\nThe following phosphorylated-STAT3 bioassay was used as a primary screen to measure neutralizing anti-IL-21 titers in murine serum as well as relative levels of IL-21 neutralization by hybridoma supernatants and purified anti-IL-21 antibodies. IL-21 activity was determined by measuring the level of STAT3-phosphorylation following ligand-receptor interaction in Baf3/KZ134/huIL-21R cells (see Spolski and Leonard, \nAnnu Rev Immunol. Nov. \n8, 2007). Relative neutralization activity was determined based on the decrease in phosphorylated-STAT3 levels using an EC\n50 \nconcentration of IL-21 and a titration of antagonist.\n\n\nBaf3/KZ134/huIL-21R cells were washed two times with assay media (RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1× Glutamax, 1% Sodium Pyruvate, and 2 μM β-Mercaptoethanol; all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) before being plated out at 40,000 cells/well in 96-well, round-bottom tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). Cells were placed in a 37° C. tissue culture incubator while the test solutions were prepared. To determine EC\n50 \nand EC\n90 \nconcentrations of IL-21 in this assay, serial dilutions of recombinant human IL-21 were prepared in assay media and plated in a separate 96-well U-bottom plate. Alternatively, to test for IL-21 neutralization, an EC\n50 \nconcentration of IL-21 (determined to be 33 pM) was preincubated with serial dilutions of IL-21-immunized mouse serum, spent hybridoma media, purified soluble human IL-21R/γc-Fc or purified monoclonal anti-IL-21 antibodies. Both the cell plate and the solution plate were then incubated in a humidified tissue culture chamber to equilibrate for 30 minutes at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. After 30 minutes, the reaction was initiated by transferring the IL-21 solutions to the cell plate and incubating for 10 minutes at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\nFollowing the 10 minute incubation, reactions were stopped by placing the plate on ice and adding 125 μL of ice-cold Cell Wash Buffer (BIO-PLEX Cell Lysis Kit, BIO-RAD Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) to each well. Cells were then spun down at 1500 rpm at 4° C. for 5 minutes and the media aspirated. To lyse the cells, 50 μL/well Lysis Buffer (prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions, BIO-RAD Labs) was added to each well. The cell lysates were then pipetted up and down five times while on ice, and agitated on a microplate platform shaker for 20 minutes at 600 rpm at 4° C. Plates were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4° C. for 20 minutes. Supernatants were collected and transferred to a new micro titer plate and mixed 1:1 with Assay Buffer (BIO-RAD) for storage at −20° C.\n\n\nCapture beads (BIO-PLEX Phospho-STAT3 Assay, BIO-RAD Laboratories) were diluted and plated in a 96-well filter plate (Millipore Corporation, Ireland) according to manufacturer's instructions. Plates were washed two times with Wash Buffer (BIO-RAD) and 50 μL of cell lysate mix was transferred to each well. Each plate was then wrapped in aluminum foil and shaken overnight at room temperature and 300 rpm. The following day, the plate was transferred to a microtiter vacuum apparatus and washed two times with Wash Buffer. After addition of 25 μL/well detection antibody (BIO-RAD), the foil-covered plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with shaking at 300 rpm. The plate was filtered and washed two times with wash buffer. Streptavidin-PE (BIO-RAD; 50 μL/well) was added, and the foil-covered plate was incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes with shaking at 300 rpm. The plate was filtered and washed two times and resuspended in 125 μL/well Bead Resuspension Buffer (BIO-RAD). The level of phosphorylated-STAT3 was then assessed using an array reader (BIO-PLEX, BIO-RAD Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data were analyzed using analytical software (BIO-PLEX MANAGER 3.0, BIO-RAD Laboratories). Increases in the level of the phosphorylated STAT3 transcription factor present in the lysates were indicative of an IL-21 receptor-ligand interaction. For the neutralization assay, decreases in the level of the phosphorylated STAT3 transcription factor present in the lysates were indicative of neutralization of the IL-21 receptor-ligand interaction. IC\n50 \n(concentration of antagonist that yields 50 percent inhibition of ligand activity) values were calculated using GraphPad Prism®4 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego Calif.) and expressed as molar concentrations for each reagent in the neutralization assay.\n\n\nHuman IL-21 induced STAT3 phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner with an EC\n50 \nconcentration determined to be approximately 33 pM. Table 7 summarizes the IC\n50 \nvalues for the positive control (soluble human IL-21R/γc-Fc fusion protein) and the IL-21 neutralizing entities described herein. These data indicate that the IL-21 neutralizing antibodies were active and were equal to or better than the positive control at reducing IL-21-induced STAT3 phosphorylation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC\n50 \nValues in STAT3-Phosphorylation Assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50 \n(pM)\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(pM)\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nExpt #\n1\n\n\n \nExpt #\n2\n\n\n \nExpt #\n3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsoluble hIL-21R/γc-Fc\n\n\n25\n\n\n102\n\n\n140.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21 mAb Clone #\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.75.1\n\n\nNo Neut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.78.1\n\n\n14\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.78.1.44\n\n\n \n\n\n41\n\n\n66.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.78-CHO (A2162F)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n42.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.328.10.63\n\n\n210 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.552.11.31\n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.617.7\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.345.6.11\n\n\nWeak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\nExpt\n 3 conducted using 96 pM IL-21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nIL-21 Baf3/huIL-21R STAT-Luciferase Bioactivity Assay\n\n\nThis 24-hour assay measures IL-21-induced STAT-Luciferase activity in Baf3/KZ134/huIL-21R transfected cells. Baf3/KZ134/huIL-21R transfected cells were washed two times with assay media (phenol red-free RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1× Glutamax, 1% Sodium Pyruvate, and 2 μM μ-Mercaptoethanol; all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) before being plated out at 40,000 cells/well in a 96-well, flat-bottom opaque white culture plates (Corning/Costar, Lowell, Mass.). Cells were then placed in a tissue culture incubator while the test solutions were prepared. In a separate plate, human IL-21 was mixed with either media or a range of IL-21 antagonists (either monoclonal antibodies or the soluble human IL-21 receptor/γc-Fc). Once mixed, this plate was also transferred to a humidified 37° C. tissue culture incubator. After 30 minutes the test solutions were transferred to the cell plate and mixed. This plate was then placed back in the incubator for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the cells were removed from the incubator and allowed to cool to room temperature. Each well was then diluted 1:1 with a 100 μL volume of Steady-Glo Luciferase reagent (Promega, Madison, Wis.) and mixed thoroughly. The plate was covered and shaken at room temperature for 10 minutes and Relative Luciferase Units (RLU) were measured on a luminometer.\n\n\nTo determine EC\n50 \nand EC\n90 \nconcentrations of IL-21 in this assay, serial dilutions of recombinant human IL-21 ranging from 0 to 100 ng/mL were tested. The EC\n90 \nconcentration of IL-21, ˜15 ng/mL (961 pM), was used in subsequent neutralization experiments. In these experiments, clones 362.78.1 (and its subclone 362.78.1.44 and CHO-expressed counterpart, 362.78-CHO; see Example 1) and 362.328.10.63 demonstrated the most potent anti-IL-21 activity, with IC\n50 \nconcentrations in the range of 300-850 pM, while the IC\n50 \nvalues for the soluble human IL-21 receptor/γc-Fc control ranged from 650-1830 pM.

In order to determine whether the anti-human IL-21 neutralizing entities described herein might cross-react and neutralize the activity induced by cynomolgus IL-21, murine IL-21 or rat IL-21(and therefore, justify either cynomolgus monkeys, mice and/or rats as viable test species), it was first necessary to demonstrate recombinant cynomolgus, murine and rat IL-21 bioactivity. The methods for IL-21 STAT-Luciferase activity assays described in Example 8 were used to determine EC\n50 \nand EC\n90 \nvalues for recombinant human IL-21, cynomolgus IL-21, murine IL-21, and rat IL-21 (all produced at ZymoGenetics). Results indicate that the levels of STAT-Luciferase activity induced by the human, cynomolgus and murine IL-21 in this assay differ widely. EC\n90 \nvalues used in subsequent experiments were determined to be as follows: 961 pM for human IL-21; 102 pM for cynomolgus monkey IL-21; 6.41 nM for mouse IL-21, and 1.08 nM for rat IL-21. IL-21 soluble receptor (hIL-21R/γc-Fc) neutralized the effects of cynomolgus, murine and rat.\n\n\nIL-21. Addition of the purified anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies shown in Table 9 neutralized cynomolgus IL-21 to varying degrees but did not neutralize murine or rat IL-21 (note that only 362.78-CHO and 366.552.11 were tested against rat IL-21). The IC\n50 \nvalues for neutralization of cynomolgus IL-21 by the neutralizing entities described herein ranged from ˜100 pM to 431 pM and are summarized in Table 9. It should be noted that the best human IL-21 neutralizing antibodies were all able to effectively neutralize cynomolgus IL-21 but not murine IL-21 or rat IL-21. Additionally, the CHO-cell produced IL-21 mAb (362.78-CHO) was tested in a separate experiment using an 800 pM concentration of cynomolgus monkey IL-21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-reaction of hIL-21 antagonists to cynomolgus monkey,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmurine and rat IL-21 in the STAT-Luciferase assay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCyno IL-21 IC\n50\n \n\n\nMurine IL-21 IC50\n\n\nRat IL-21 IC\n50\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n([cIL-21] = 100 pM)\n\n\n([mIL-21] = 6.41 nM)\n\n\n([rIL-21] = 1.08 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nng/mL\n\n\nMolar conc.\n\n\nng/mL\n\n\nMolar conc.\n\n\nng/mL\n\n\nMolar conc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsoluble hIL-21R/γc-\nFc\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n385\n\n\npM\n\n\n425.8\n\n\n8.06 nM\n\n\n707.5\n\n\n13.4 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21 mAb Clone:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.75.1\n\n\nweak\n\n\n—\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\nN/T\n\n\nN/T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.78.1\n\n\n60\n\n\n400\n\n\npM\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\nN/T\n\n\nN/T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362.78-CHO (A2162F)*\n\n\n255\n\n\n1.7\n\n\nnM\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.328.10\n\n\n15\n\n\n100\n\n\npM\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\nN/T\n\n\nN/T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.552.11\n\n\n23\n\n\n156\n\n\npM\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366.617.7\n\n\n65\n\n\n431\n\n\npM\n\n\nnone\n\n\nnone\n\n\nN/T\n\n\nN/T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Note:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone 362.78-CHO (Example 1b) was tested using an 800 pM concentration of cIL-21 instead of 100 pM as was used in other experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN/T = not tested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\nEvaluation of Potential Cross-Reaction to IL-4 in a Cell-Based Assay\n\n\nWhen developing a therapeutic cytokine antagonist, it is important to know if it will cross-react with and neutralize structurally related cytokines. This primary B cell proliferation assay was designed to test the IL-21 neutralizing entities described herein for cross-reaction to and neutralization of human IL-4.\n\n\nIsolation of primary B cells: To obtain primary B cells, 200 mL peripheral blood was collected from healthy human volunteers (ZymoGenetics). Blood was diluted to 400 ml with room temperature PBS and 35 mL aliquots were made in 50 ml conical tubes. Fourteen mL of room temperature Ficoll/Hypaque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was underlaid and the tubes were spun for 20 minutes at 2000 rpm. The PBMC interface layer was aspirated and washed two times with MACS buffer (PBS, \nHEPES\n 20 mM, and 1% BSA; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Cells were counted and B cells were negatively selected using the B Cell Isolation Kit from Miltenyi Biotec (Auburn, Calif.) following the protocol outlined by the manufacturer. A small sample of the purified B cells were tested for purity by FACS analysis and found to be >97% pure CD19\n+\n B cells in all experiments.\n\n\nProliferation assay: B cells proliferate in response to IL-4 co-culture with immobilized anti-IgM. To determine potential cross-reaction to and neutralization of IL-4 by anti-IL-21 mAbs, previously isolated B cells were first plated at 40,000-50,000 cells/well in a 96-well U-bottom tissue culture plate (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) that had been pre-coated with 1.0 μg/mL anti-IgM (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, Ala.). The cells were then treated with 10 ng/mL recombinant human IL-4 (R&D Systems; Minneapolis, Minn.) and a titration series of an IL-21 antagonist (test antibodies or controls). The cells were then incubated for 3 days at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \nin a humidified tissue culture incubator. After three days, the cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/well of [\n3\nH]-Thymidine (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). After 16 hours, the cells were harvested onto glass-fiber filters and the amount of [\n3\nH]-incorporation was quantitated using a beta counter (Topcount NXT, Packard). None of the three anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies tested (362.78.1, 366.328.10.6 and 366.552.11.31) showed any neutralization of IL-4-induced proliferation at up to a 250-fold molar excess.\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\n11A. Evaluation of Potential Cross-Reaction to IL-2 and IL-15 in a Cell-Based Assay\n\n\nWhen developing a therapeutic cytokine antagonist, it is important to determine if it will cross-react with and neutralize structurally related cytokines. The murine T cell line, CTLL-2, can be induced to proliferate in response to human IL-2 or IL-15. Therefore, this assay was chosen to test the IL-21 neutralizing entities described herein for cross-reaction to and neutralization of human IL-2 and IL-15.\n\n\nCTLL-2 cells were washed three times in proliferation bioassay media (\nRPMI\n 1640, 2× Glutamax, 10% FBS, 2× NaPyr, 1× B-mercaptoethanol and 20 mM Hepes; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), and plated at 50000 cells per well in 96-well round bottom tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Falls, N.J.). To these cells, a predetermined EC\n90 \ndose of either IL-2 (3.0 ng/mL) or IL-15 (0.5 ng/mL) in combination with a serial dilution of the IL-21 neutralizing entities was added. The ratio of cytokine to antibody ranged from a 250-fold molar excess to a 1:1 ratio. Anti-IL-2 or anti-IL-15 neutralizing antibodies (both from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) were used as positive controls. The cells were then incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \nin a humidified tissue culture incubator. After 24 hours, the cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/well of [\n3\nH]-Thymidine (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Sixteen hours later, the cells were harvested onto glass-fiber filters and the amount of [\n3\nH]-incorporation was quantitated using a beta counter (Topcount NXT, Packard).\n\n\nResults: None of the three anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies tested (362.78.1, 366.328.10.6 and 366.552.11.31) showed any neutralization of IL-2 or IL-15-induced proliferation.\n\n\n11B.—Confirmation Using Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore) that IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO does not Bind IL-21-Related Human Cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 or IL-15.\n\n\nThe anti-IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO was evaluated via surface plasmon resonance for potential cross reactivity to human IL-2, human IL-4, human IL-7, human IL-9, and human IL-15.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods: Experiments were completed to test the cross reactivity of the anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody 362.78-CHO for human IL-2, human IL-4, human IL-7, human IL-9, and human IL-15. Binding studies were performed on a BIACORE T100™ (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Methods were programmed using BIACORE T100™ Control Software, v 2.0. Goat anti-human IgG Fc-gamma specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa.) was covalently immobilized to flow \n \ncells\n \n 1 and 2 of a CM4 sensor chip using amine coupling chemistry (EDC:NHS). The purified anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody 362.78-CHO was subsequently captured onto \nflow cell\n 2 of the sensor chip at a density of approximately 240 RU. Flow \ncell\n 1 was used as the reference surface.\n\n\nIL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 (all purchased from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) were injected over the captured antibody surface (flow cell 2) and the reference flow cell (flow cell 1) at concentrations of 100, 20, and 4 nM. As a positive control for this set of experiments, IL-21 (produced at ZymoGenetics) was also injected at identical concentrations. Binding studies were performed with a flow rate of 25 μL/min, an association time of 2 minutes, and a dissociation time of 3 minutes. All binding experiments were performed at 25° C. in a buffer of 10 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.05% Surfactant P20 (Biacore), 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0. Between cycles, the flow cell was washed with 20 mM hydrochloric acid to regenerate the surface. This wash step removed both the captured 362.78-CHO antibody and any bound antigen from the chip surface. Data was compiled using BIACORE T100™ Evaluation software (version 2.0). Data was processed by subtracting reference flow cell and blank injections. Baseline stability was assessed to ensure that the regeneration step provided a consistent binding surface throughout the sequence of injections.\n\n\nResults: No binding of IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, or IL-15 to the 362.78-CHO antibody was observed. In contrast, the IL-21 positive control demonstrated a dose dependent binding that was consistent with previous studies.\n\n\nThis lack of cross-reactivity was subsequently explained by epitope mapping studies of clone 362.78 (see Example 17). The amino acids located in and near the D-helix of IL-21 shown to be bound by clone 362.78 (EKKPPKEFLERFKSLL; SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 129 to 144)) are not well-conserved among the related human gamma-chain cytokines, nor within mouse IL-21, as shown below in Table 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL21_HUMAN\n\n\n------TCPSCDSY\nEKK--PPKEFLERFKSLL\nQKMIHQHLSSTHGSEDS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL21_MOUSE\n\n\n------KCPSCDSYEKR--TPKEFLERLKWLLQKMIHQHLS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL15_HUMAN\n\n\n-------CKECEELEEK--NIKEFLQSFVHIVQMFINTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL2_HUMAN\n\n\n------TTFMCEYADET-ATIVEFLNRWITFCQSIISTLT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL4_HUMAN\n\n\n---GLAGLNSCPVKEANQSTLENFLERLKTIMREKYSKCSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL7_HUMAN\n\n\n----SLEENKSLKEQKK-LNDLCFLKRLLQEIKTCWNKILMGTKEH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL9_HUMAN\n\n\n------CEQPCNQTTAG--NALTFLKSLLEIFQKEKMRGMRGKI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21 human is shown as SEQ ID NO:2; IL-21 mouse is shown as SEQ ID NO:11; IL-15 human is shown as SEQ ID NO:92; IL-2 human is shown as SEQ ID NO:93; IL-4 human is shown as SEQ ID NO:94; IL-7 human is shown as SEQ ID NO:95; IL-9 human is shown as SEQ ID NO:96.\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\nB Cell Proliferation Assays\n\n\nPrimary B Cell Assays\n\n\nTo further test the activity of the IL-21 neutralizing entities, two primary B cell assays were developed. The B cell proliferation assay was used to demonstrate neutralization of IL-21 induced proliferation over 4 days and the B cell differentiation assay demonstrated the neutralization of IL-21 induced plasma cell differentiation over 8 days. These experiments demonstrated neutralization of IL-21 in long-term biologically relevant assays.\n\n\nIsolation of primary human B cells: To obtain primary B cells, 200 mL peripheral blood was collected from healthy human volunteers (ZymoGenetics). Blood was diluted with 200 mL of room temperature PBS and 35 mL aliquots were made in 50 mL conical tubes. Fourteen mL of room temperature Ficoll/Hypaque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was underlaid and the tubes were spun for 20 minutes at 2000 rpm. The PBMC interface layer was aspirated and washed two times with MACS buffer (PBS, \nHEPES\n 20 mM, and 1% BSA; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Cells were counted and B cells were negatively selected using the B Cell Isolation Kit from Miltenyi Biotec (Auburn, Calif.) following the protocol outlined by the manufacturer. A small sample of the purified B cells were tested for purity by FACS analysis and found to be >97% pure in all experiments.\n\n\nProliferation assay: B cells proliferate in response to co-culture with anti-CD40 and IL-21. To determine the neutralization activity of the anti-IL-21 mAbs, B cells were plated at 40000-50000 cells/well in a 96-well U-bottom tissue culture treated plate (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). The cells were then treated with 0.1 μg/mL anti-CD40 (goat anti-human CD40 polyclonal; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.), 50 ng/mL (3.21 nM) recombinant IL-21 (ZymoGenetics, A1207F) and a titration of an IL-21 antagonist (test mAbs or controls). The plate of cells was then incubated for 3 days at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \nin a humidified incubator. After three days, the cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/well of [\n3\nH]-Thymidine (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). After 16 hours, the cells were then harvested onto glass-fiber filters and the amount of [\n3\nH]-incorporation was quantitated using a beta counter (Topcount NXT, Packard). IC\n50 \ncurves measuring the effective neutralization of IL-21-induced proliferation were calculated and expressed as a molar concentration. The IC\n50 \nvalues for the top neutralizing mAbs described herein ranged from 0.71 nM to 6.55 nM and are summarized in Table 11:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutralization of IL-21 in B Cell Proliferation Assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIL-21 Antagonist\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsoluble hIL-21R/γc-Fc\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n362.75.1\n\n\nNo Neutralization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n362.78.1\n\n\n1.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n366.328.10\n\n\n0.71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n366.552.11\n\n\n4.75\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n366.617.7\n\n\n6.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB Cell Differentiation Assay: The differentiation of naïve B cells into antibody-producing plasma cells is greatly facilitated in vitro when IL-21 is combined with anti-CD40 and IL-4 (Ettinger et al., \nJ Immunol. \n175:7867-79, 2005; Ettinger et al, \nJ Immunol. \n178:2872-82, 2007; Kuchen et al. \nJ Immunol. \n179:5886-96, 2007). To demonstrate activity in a longer term assay than the two Baf3-based screening assays described in Examples 7 and 8, the neutralizing entities described herein were used to neutralize IL-21 and inhibit human plasma cell differentiation. To accomplish this, primary human B cells were plated at 150,000 cells/well in a 96-well flat bottom tissue culture treated plate (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). The cells were then treated with 0.1 g/1 mL anti-CD40 (goat anti-human CD40 polyclonal; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.), 10 ng/mL recombinant human IL-4 (R&D Systems) and 25 ng/mL (1.6 nM) recombinant human IL-21 (ZymoGenetics). IL-21 antagonists (test mAbs or controls) were then added and the cells incubated at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \nfor eight days in a humidified incubator. At the end of eight days, conditioned medias were collected (for antibody titers) and cells pelleted for subsequent flow cytometry analysis.\n\n\nB cell analysis using flow cytometry: Cells were resuspended in human FACS buffer (HBSS, 20 mM HEPES, 1% BSA (all from Invitrogen) and 2% Human Ab Serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, Calif.)) for five minutes to block Fc receptors. Cells were then centrifuged (5 minutes at 1200 rpm) and aspirated. Stains were prepared by diluting antibodies 1:100 in human FACS buffer and dispensing 100 μL per sample. Single stains (to adjust cytomer compensation settings) and a multi-stain mixture were prepared using the following antibodies: anti-CD138-FITC, anti-IgD-PE, anti-CD38-PE-Cy5.5 and anti-CD19-APC. Plasma cells were defined as large (assessed by forward light scatter) CD19\n+\n, IgD\nlo\n, CD38\n+\n and CD138\n+\n cells. The percentage of plasma cells relative to total B cells was used to determine effectiveness of the neutralizing entities described herein.\n\n\nResults: When IL-21 was combined with IL-4 and anti-CD40, approximately 50% of the live, large B cells on day 8 were IgD\nlow\n, CD138\n+\n plasma cells. Without IL-21, the proportion of plasma cells was ˜8% of the large B cells. The addition of the various IL-21 antagonists to the IL-21-containing cultures decreased the proportion of plasma cells in a dose-dependent manner. Clone 362.78.1 was the most effective neutralizer, and almost completely neutralized IL-21 activity at the 10:1 and 2.5:1 antagonist:ligand ratios. The other antibodies tested, clones 366.328.10.63 and 366.552.11.31 were nearly as effective at neutralizing the IL-21 driven differentiation.

A DTH response is a good indicator of a CD4+ T cell mediated response. Mice are immunized subcutaneously with chicken ovalbumin protein (OVA) in either of 2 adjuvants, Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA; Sigma) or Ribi (Sigma; aka MPL+TDM+CWS adjuvant). This phase is called the sensitization phase (days 0-6). Ear measurements are taken seven days later. Mice are then injected in the ear with control PBS (left ear) or OVA (right ear). This phase is called the challenge phase (days 7-8). Immune responses generated to OVA induce inflammation in the ear resulting an increase in ear thickness in 24 hours in the OVA-treated, but not in the PBS-treated ear. This is measured using calipers.\n\n\nC57BL/6 mice (n=8/group) are immunized in the back with 100 μg chicken ovalbumin (OVA) emulsified in CFA in a total volume of 200 μl. If Ribi is used instead of CFA, 0.5 mg/ml of ovalbumin is added to a single vial of RIBI and vortexed vigorously for 2 minutes to form an emulsion that is used to inject mice. Seven days after the immunization, mice are injected with 10 μl PBS in the left ear (control) and with 10 μg OVA in PBS in the right ear in a volume of 10 μl. Ear thickness of all mice is measured before injecting mice in the ear (0 measurement). Ear thickness is measured 24 hours after challenge. The difference in ear thickness between the 0 measurement and the 24 hour measurement is calculated and is reflective of the inflammation in the ear. Groups of mice are injected with PBS or different concentration of anti-IL-21 antibody intra-peritoneally from either days 0-6 (sensitization phase) or from days 7-8 (challenge phase). The injection on day 7 and 8 is given 2 hours before measuring ear thickness at the 0 and 24 hour time points. At the end of the 24 hour period, once ear thickness was measured, the ears were cut and placed in formalin for histological analysis.\n\n\nExample 14\n\n\nMouse Model for Multiple Sclerosis\n\n\nTo test if anti-IL-21 has any effects on multiple sclerosis, the ability of anti-IL-21 antibodies to inhibit experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE-MS), a mouse model for MS is tested. The well characterized T cell-dependent myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55 peptide immunization model in C57BL/6 mice is used. The experiment is run to determine that anti-IL-21 antibody could delay and/or inhibit disease scores in EAE either by inhibiting DC mediated antigen presentation or by enhancing CD8 T cell responses. Absence of efficient CD8 T cell responses in this model exacerbates EAE (Malipiero et. al., \nEur. J. Immunol., \n27:3151-3160, 1997). Delayed onset of disease in the EAE model in a dose dependent manner suggests that use of anti-IL-21 antibody may be beneficial in MS.\n\n\nEAE is a mouse model for MS. In one such model, C57BL/6 mice are immunized with 100 μg MOG peptide (MOG35-55) or 100 μg recombinant MOG protein emulsified in CFA adjuvant. Two milliliters of a 0.5 mg/ml preparation of the MOG35-55 in PBS is added to a vial of CFA and vortexed vigorously to emulsify the solution or a 1:1 ratio of recombinant MOG in CFA is prepared. The backs of mice are shaved and 100 μg MOG/CFA is injected s.c in the backs of mice. Weights of mice are taken 2 days before and every day after the immunization. Mice are then injected on \nday\n 2 i.v. with 200 μl pertussis toxin (PT), a final concentration of 200 ng/mouse. Mice are monitored daily for clinical scores. Groups of mice are injected i.p. with 200 μl PBS, 100 μg BSA, 10 μg-200 μg anti-IL-21 antibody in a 200 μl volume from days 0-20, or 3× a week for 3 weeks. The weights of mice, clinical scores and incidence are evaluated and plotted for analysis.\n\n\nExample 15\n\n\nAnti-mIL-21 Antibody Decreases Disease Incidence and Progression in a Mouse Model of T-Cell Adoptive Transfer Colitis and Psoriasis\n\n\nAdoptive transfer of naïve T cells into minor histocompatibility mismatched or syngeneic immunocompromised mice leads to development of colitis (Leach M W et al 1996, Powrie F et al, 1997) as well as skin lesions resembling psoriasis (Schon M P et al., \nNat Med. \n2:183-8, 1997; Davenport C M et al., \nInt Immunopharmacol. \n5:653-72, 2002). Transplantation of as few as 0.2 million CD4+CD25− T cells from BALB/C or B10.D2 mice into immunocompromised C.B-17 SCID mice results in weight loss, hemoccult positive stool and development of skin lesions. The symptoms in these mice vary from colony to colony.\n\n\nThis model of colitis/psoriasis has some similarities to human Crohn's disease and psoriasis, and has been used extensively to test efficacy of therapeutics for these diseases in humans. For this experiment, mice (8 B10.D2 female mice donors; 50 C.B-17 SCID female recipients) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories or Charles River Laboratories, respectively. Spleens from 8 B10.D2 mice were collected. CD4+CD25− T-cell were isolated from pooled spleens using standard methodology known in the art. Purity of the T-cell population was evaluated by flow cytometry.\n\n\nNaïve C.B-17 SCID mice received 5×10\n5 \nCD4+CD25− T-cells (isolated from spleens of B10.D2 mice) via intravenous injection on \nday\n 0. All mice were weighed at least five times per week and carefully observed for weight loss, which can be associated with colitis. In addition, a clinical colitis score [stool consistency and blood in stool] was taken at least one day per week. Mice were also carefully monitored at least five days per week and assigned a score for signs of psoriatic symptoms (hair loss, scratching, alopecia, etc).\n\n\nA rat anti-mouse IL-21 (mIL-21) antibody, a rat isotype control antibody, or vehicle (PBS) was administered to groups of mice beginning on \nday\n 0. The treatments were delivered as intraperitoneal injections, twice a week, with the antibodies being administered at 0.2 or 0.8 mg per mouse per dose. They could also be delivered using a similar dosing regimen or other route of administration. There were 9-10 mice per group in the anti-IL21 antibody groups, 6-7 mice per group in the isotype control antibody groups, and 10 mice per group in the PBS group. This dosing regimen is referred to as “prophylactic dosing”.\n\n\nIn a separate experiment, groups of mice dosed with the same antibodies and doses described above (10 mice per group) started their treatments on day 12 following cell transfer, which is approximately the day that the mice began showing signs of psoriasis and/or colitis. This dosing regimen is referred to as “therapeutic dosing”.\n\n\nAt the end of the study (day 45), colonic tissue was submitted for histological evidence of colitis and serum for analysis of cytokine and chemokine levels.\n\n\nResults of Prophylactic Dosing: Mice receiving the anti-mIL-21 antibody at both the 0.2 and 0.8 mg doses were characterized by significant (at least p<0.05 or better) reductions in body weight loss and significant reductions in psoriatic skin and colitis symptom throughout the experimental period compared to mice administered PBS or 0.2 mg isotype control monoclonal antibody. At the end of the study (day 45), mice treated with either dose of the mIL-21 antibody were at approximately 100% of their starting body weight, whereas PBS-treated mice had lost an average of 16% of their starting body weight and mice treated with an isotype control antibody had lost 10-15% of their starting body weight. At day 45, mice treated with either dose of the mIL-21 antibody had approximately 6.5-7-fold lower average colitis clinical scores and approximately 5-7 fold lower average psoriatic skin scores. Only 20% of mice treated with 0.2 mg anti-mIL-21 antibody developed psoriasis, which was mild, whereas none of the mice treated with the 0.8 mg dose developed any psoriatic skin symptoms. On the other hand, 100% of the PBS-treated mice developed psoriasis, with approximately 50% of these mice developing severe symptoms. At the end of the study, there was also a significant reduction in histologic indices of colitis (scored for intestinal inflammation, lesions, and architecture) in the anti-mIL-21 antibody treated mice compared to PBS- and 0.2 mg isotype-control treated mice.\n\n\nMice treated with anti-mIL-21 antibody had significantly lower serum IL-6, RANTES, TNF-α, and MIP-1β levels compared to PBS-treated mice, further supporting an anti-inflammatory role for anti-mIL-21 antibody.\n\n\nResults of Therapeutic Dosing: Mice receiving the anti-mIL-21 antibody at both the 0.2 and 0.8 mg doses, beginning from day 12 following T cell transfers, were characterized by reductions in body weight loss and significant reductions in colitis symptoms throughout the experimental period compared to mice administered the isotype control monoclonal antibody. At day 45, mice treated with either dose of the anti-mIL-21 antibody had approximately 3.5-4-fold lower average colitis clinical scores compared to isotype control antibody-treated mice. Mice treated with the 0.8 mg dose of anti-mIL-21 antibody had lower psoriasis scores than isotype control antibody- or PBS-treated mice.\n\n\nSummary: Taken together, these results indicate that in vivo administration of an anti-mIL-21 antibody was efficacious in reducing colitis and psoriasis onset and severity in a murine T cell transfer model, and suggest that anti-IL-21 antibodies may be efficacious in treating human inflammatory bowel disease and/or psoriasis.\n\n\nExample 16\n\n\nContact Hypersensitivity Mouse Model\n\n\nContact hypersensitivity can be induced in mice using a variety of contact allergens including dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) and oxazolone. Mice are sensitized topically with the allergen in a vehicle of acetone and olive oil and then challenged in the ear with the allergen in olive oil alone. Change in ear thickness is a measure of the immune response against the allergen. Anti-IL-21 antibodies are administered either at the sensitization phase (days 0-5) or during the challenge phase (days 5-6). Inhibition of ear thickness by antagonizing IL-21 indicates a role for IL-21 in inducing contact hypersensitivity.\n\n\nC57BI/6 mice are painted on the back with 0.5% DNFB in acetone:olive oil (4:1) or acetone:olive oil alone on \nday\n 0. On day 5, ear thickness of mice is measured using calipers and mice are challenged in the ears with olive oil alone (control) or 0.25% DNFB in olive oil by dropping a 25 μl solution onto the ear. Change in ear thickness is measured on day 6 and the inflammation calculated as a difference in ear thickness between day 5 and day 6. Groups of mice are injected i.p. with PBS or 10-100 μg anti-IL-21 antibodies on either days 0-5 or days 5-6.\n\n\nInhibition of ear thickness by anti-IL-21 antibodies demonstrates that anti-IL-21 antibodies can be useful in inhibiting contact hypersensitivity.\n\n\nExample 17\n\n\nEpitope Mapping\n\n\nA. Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange (HDx) Experiment\n\n\nIn an effort to identify the epitope regions of IL-21 recognized by neutralizing anti-IL-21 mAbs 362.78.1.44, 362.597.3, 366.328.10, 366.552.11 and the soluble hIL-21R/γc-Fc an immunoaffinity-based hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDx) method was applied followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Specifically, the purified mAbs were immobilized on CNBr-activated sepharose beads and exchanged into deuterium buffer. Deuterated IL-21 was bound to the immunoaffinity beads by incubation and the beads were washed with deuterated buffer to remove unbound proteins. The antigen-antibody complex was then subjected to PBS solution to initiate back-exchange to amide hydrogen on the unbound regions of IL-21. Deuterium hydrogen exchange was then quenched and IL-21 was eluted in low pH buffer, which was then subjected to proteolytic digestion by immobilized pepsin. Peptide mass maps were then generated by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and compared with that of the control sample, generated from the free state of IL-21, which was exchanged back to amide hydrogen from the deuterated IL-21 by dilution with PBS solution. \nFIG. 3\n shows expanded mass spectra of pepsin-digested peptides of both the free-state of IL-21 (\nFIGS. 3A and 3C\n) and the antibody-bound IL-21 (\nFIGS. 3B and 3D\n). As indicated in \nFIG. 3A\n, overlapping peptide isotope were assigned to corresponding peptides EKKPPKEF (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 129 to 136) (m/z, 1002.5619 Da) and LERFKSLL (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 137 to 144) (m/z, 1005.6091 Da) of the free-state of IL-21 with theoretical peptide masses within 10 ppm mass accuracy. A small amount of residual deuterated peptide was observed around m/z, 1002.5619 Da, due to incomplete amide hydrogen exchange.\n\n\n \nFIG. 3B\n is a spectrum of the same mass range of \nFIG. 3A\n showing the two overlapping peptide isotope envelopes having monoisotope ions at 1014.49 m/z and 1015.00 m/z. Because two peptide ions were clustered around the same mass range, it was difficult to assign each peptide identity between the two ions. However, tandem mass spectrometry data of the peptide ions of \nFIGS. 3A\n and B showed that they had identical peptide fragmentation patterns (data not shown). Although there was a small percentage of non-deuterated peptide detected from the sample obtained from the antigen-antibody complex, the majority of the peptide ions retained deuterium and shifted to the higher mass region by virtue of limited solvent accessibility to the antibody/antigen binding regions, indicating that the mAb binding site likely contains the region EKKPPKEFLERFKSLL (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 129 to 144).\n\n\nAnother pepsin-digested peptide from both the free-state of IL-21 and the antigen-antibody complex was observed as shown in \nFIGS. 3C\n and D and it was identified as KSLLQKMIHQHLSSRTHGSEDS (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 141 to 162) (m/z, 2519.2451) based on the theoretical mass of pepsin-digested peptide fragment of IL-21. As shown in \nFIG. 3D\n, comparing the mass shift of this 22-amino acid residue peptide (Δmass=9.0 Da) with the mass shift of those two upstream residues (\nFIG. 2B\n, EKKPPKEF (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 129 to 136) and LERFKSLL (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 137-144), this region was only marginally protected upon binding of the mAb, indicating that only a portion of this peptide may be involved in binding to the mAb. In fact this peptide sequence is the C-terminal tail and it contains four overlapping amino acid residues with the peptide (LERFKSLL (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 137 to 144), which appeared to be significantly protected by the mAb. Based on these mass spectrometric measurements of deuterium retention, we estimated that the IL-21 epitope for binding of the mAb EKKPPKEFLERFKSLL (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 129 to 144) and the upstream sequence of KSLLQKMIHQHLSSRTHGSEDS (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 141 to 162).\n\n\nB. Lysine Labeling Protection Experiment\n\n\nUsing the HDx assay, the IL-21 mAb binding epitope region was estimated and it was observed that five lysine residues (from a total of 12 lysine residues in IL-21) reside in the estimated binding epitope region. Since lysine residues are most likely to be present at solvent accessible regions of proteins due to their charged characteristic, lysine appears to be an ideal choice for selective chemical modification for a parallel determination of the antigen epitope region. The concept behind the chemical modification strategy is that the protection of lysine modification in an antigen in the presence and absence of antibody correlates to its binding epitope (Scholten et al., \nJ. Amer. Soc. Mass Spectr. \n17: 983-994, 2006). Therefore, for further characterization of the epitope region and for the determination of those lysine residues involved in the binding of the mAb, selective acetylation on lysine residues was performed in both the affinity-bound and free states of IL-21. The site of lysine modification/protection was determined by whole mass and peptide mapping analyses using MALDI-TOF and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry.\n\n\nScholten et al., (Scholten et al., \nJ. Amer. Soc. Mass Spectr. \n17: 983-994, 2006) investigated the molar ratio between the acetylation reagent (NHS-acetate) and an antigen for the full acetylation of solvent accessible lysine residues and found that the labeling was effective at 250-fold molar excess of the reagent in 3 min reaction. To determine the binding epitope, the same labeling reaction condition was employed for both the free state IL-21 and the affinity bound IL-21 with several neutralizing IL-21 mAbs, as well as the IL-21 heterodimeric receptor protein (IL-21R/γc-Fc). With the given labeling reaction condition, different solvent accessibility of lysine residues of the IL-21 alone and the affinity-bound IL-21 gave rise to the distribution of lysine acetylation (acetyl occupancy) on the IL-21 molecule. The number of protected lysine residues on the affinity-bound IL-21 was compared to the IL-21 alone by the most intense ion. Spectral alignment based on the most intense ions clearly showed that the number of lysine acetylations on the antigens isolated from different immune complexes is varied. It was evident that the lysine labeling reagent was less accessible into the affinity-bound IL-21. Hence, the acetylation was reduced by the binding of the antigen to the antibody.\n\n\nThe acetylation protected lysines, which may be involved in the binding of the mAb, were further probed by protease digestion, and followed by peptide mass mapping analysis using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Since covalently modified lysine residues are resistant to tryptic digestion, pepsin proteolytic enzyme was used to generate more mass spectrometry-detectable peptides to study the lysine modification in more detail. The modification of individual peptides using single peptide ion chromatography was investigated. As shown in \nFIG. 4\n, selected ion chromatograms were generated from both the control (IL-21 alone) and the test samples (affinity bound IL-21 molecules) to determine acetylated and non-acetylated lysine residues. \nFIG. 4A\n is a selected ion chromatogram of a proteolytic peptide eluting at 56.22 min in the given chromatographic condition and the monoisotope peptide ion mass was at 662.9 Da, which appeared to be in a triply charged state (Δm=0.3 Da) as indicated in the embedded mass spectrum. Identification of this peptide in a triply charged state as the lysine acetylated pepsin-digested peptide fragment, TCPSCDSYEKKPPKEF (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 119 to 136) (m/z, 1986 Da) was made, whereas the non-acetylated peptide mass is 1860 Da (m/z). The mass difference (acetylated peptide/non-acetylated peptide) was 126 Da, indicating that all three lysine residues in this peptide were acetylated in the free-state of IL-21. However, a selected ion chromatogram of the affinity bound IL-21 showed no trace of the peptide (\nFIG. 4B\n) indicating that the three lysine residues were completely protected by the IL-21 antibody binding.\n\n\nAn additional pepsin-digested peptide (KSLLQKMI (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 141 to 148) was found to be protected upon binding of IL-21 mAb (\nFIGS. 4C and 4D\n). Its monoisotopic ion was at 509 Da (m/z) as a doubly charged ion (Δm=0.5 Da) and the mass difference (acetylated peptide/non-acetylated peptide) was 42 Da, indicating that only one of the two lysine residues in this peptide was protected. Earlier H/D exchange experiments indicated that the lysine upstream of the C-terminal tail of the peptide sequence, KSLLQKMIHQHLSSRTHGSEDS (SEQ ID NO: 2 from residue 141 to 162), was most likely protected by the antibody binding. Thus it is most likely that K 113 instead of K 119 of the mature IL-21 molecule (i.e., K141 instead of K147 of SEQ ID NO: 2) is involved in the antibody binding.\n\n\nFour lysine residues (K102, K103, K106 and K113 of the mature IL-21 molecule (i.e., K130, K131, K134, and K141 of SEQ ID NO:2)) were protected from acetylation by clones 362.78.1.44 and 362.597.3 binding and they were located within the estimated IL-21 mAb binding epitope region as determined from the HDx assay. Collectively, the acetylation protection assay provided the involvement of specific lysine residues in the antigen-antibody interaction and further confirmed the epitope sequence estimated from the HDx assay.\n\n\n17C.—Comparison of IL-21 Amino Acid Sequences from Various Species\n\n\nTo better understand the species cross-reactivity results in Examples 3 and 9, in light of the defined epitopes on IL-21 bound by the IL-21 mAbs (Example 17A and B), amino acid sequences were obtained and compared for IL-21 across multiple species (Table 13). The overall human sequence was more than 96% identical to cynomologus and rhesus monkey sequences, while only 61-65% identical to the rodent IL-21 sequences. Notably, the discontinuous epitope bound by clones 362.78.1.44 and 362.597.3 as described in Example 17 (underlined in Table 13) is identical in human, cynomolgus and rhesus monkey IL-21, while the rat IL-21 sequence differs from human IL-21 in 6 residues in these regions, and the mouse IL-21 sequence differs by 7 residues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21 amino acid sequence alignment for human, cynomolgus monkey,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nrhesus monkey, rat and mouse IL-21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHu IL-21\n\n\nMRSSPGNMERIVICLMVIFLGTLVHKSSS QGQDRHMIRMRQLID\nIVDQLKNYVNDL\nV\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCynoIL-21\n\n\nMRSSPGNMERIVICLMVIFLGTLVHKSSS QGQDRHMIRMRQLIDIVDQLKNYVNDLD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRhesusIL-21\n\n\nMRSSPGNMERIVICLMVIFLGTLVHKSSS QGQDRHMIRMRQLIDIVDQLKNYVNDLD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRat IL-21\n\n\n       MERTLVCLILIFLGTVAHKSSP QRPDHLLIRLRHLMDIVEQLKIYENDLD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuIL-21\n\n\n       MERTLVCLVVIFLGTVAHKSSP QGPDRLLIRLRHLIDIVEQLKIYENDLD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHu\n\n\nPEFLPAPEDVETNCEWSAFSCFQKAQLKSANTGNNERIINVSIKKLKRKPP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyno\n\n\nPEFLPAPEDVETNCEWSAISCFQKAQLKSANTGNNERIINLSIKKLKRKSP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRh\n\n\nPEFLPAPEDVETNCEWSAISCFQKAQLKSANTGNNERIINLSIKKLKRKSP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRat\n\n\nPELLTAPQDVKGQCEHEAFACFQKAKLKPSNTGNNKTFINDLLAQLRRRLP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\n\n\nPELLSAPQDVKGHCEHAAFACFQKAKLKPSNPGNNKTFIIDLVAQLRRRLP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHu\n\n\nSTNAGRRQKHRLTCPSCDSY\nEKKPPKEFLERFKSLL\nQKMIHQHLSSRTHGSEDS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyno\n\n\nSTGAERRQKHRLTCPSCDSYEKKPPKEFLERFKSLLQKMIHQHLSSRTHGSEDS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRh\n\n\nSTGAERRQKHRLTCPSCDSYEKKPPKEFLERFKSLLQKMIHQHLSSRTHGSEDS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRat\n\n\nAKRTGNKQRHMAKCPSCDLYEKKTPKEFLERLKWLLQKMIHQHLS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\n\n\nARRGGKKQKHIAKCPSCDSYEKRTPKEFLERLKWLLQKMIHQHLS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21 human is shown as SEQ ID NO:2; IL-21; mouse is shown as SEQ ID NO:11; IL-21 cynomylous is shown as SEQ ID NO:9; IL-21 rhesus is shown as SEQ ID NO:9; IL-21 rat is shown as SEQ ID NO:97.\n\n\nThe discontinuous epitope determined for two highly related anti-hIL-21 mAbs 362.78.1 and 362.597.3 is underlined above.\n\n\nExample 18\n\n\nAnti-Idiotype Monoclonal Antibodies to 362.78-CHO for Use in Pre-Clinical and Clinical Immunoassays\n\n\nAnti-idiotype mAbs were generated specific for 362.78-CHO for application in pre-clinical and clinical immunoassays, such that potential anti-362.78-CHO antibody responses in individuals treated with this therapeutic anti-IL-21 mAb can be specifically measured.\n\n\nTo distinguish between the immunogen (362.78-CHO), which is itself an antibody, and the anti-idiotype antibodies in this Example, the immunogen will be designated as Ab1 and an anti-idiotype antibody will be designated as Ab2. An anti-idiotypic antibody should inhibit (neutralize) binding of the Ab1 to its antigen (IL-21). However, it should be noted that in the process, anti-Ab1 antibodies will be generated that are not anti-idiotypic. By definition, these will be anti-362.78-CHO binding, non-neutralizing antibodies and may also be of use in the pre-clinical and clinical immunoassays.\n\n\nMethods: To immunize mice with 362.78-CHO, five 6 to 8 week old BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass.) were immunized with 362.78-CHO. The mice were initially immunized by subcutaneous injection with ˜50 μg of purified, 362.78-CHO (Lot#A2125F) in combination with Emulsigen®-P adjuvant (MVP Laboratories INC, Omaha, Nebr.) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Following the initial immunization, each of the mice received an additional 50 μg of 362.78-CHO in Emulsigen®-P adjuvant via the subcutaneous route every two weeks over a six week period. Seven days after the third and fourth immunizations the mice were bled via the retro orbital plexus and the serum was separated from the blood for analysis of its ability to bind to 362.78-CHO.\n\n\nSelection of fusion animal using both a capture assay and a neutralization assay:\n\n\nCapture Assay: The ability of mouse anti-362.78-CHO (Ab2, anti-idiotype) antibodies in the antisera to bind to 362.78-CHO (Ab1, produced in CHO cells, lot #E10569) was assessed using a capture style ELISA assay. In this assay, wells of 96-well polystyrene ELISA plates were first coated with 100 μL/well of goat anti-human IgG, Fc specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.) at a concentration of 1 μg/mL in Coating Buffer (0.1M Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, pH 9.6). Plates were incubated overnight at 4° C. after which unbound antibody was aspirated and the plates washed twice with 300 μL/well of Wash Buffer (PBS-Tween defined as 0.137M NaCl, 0.0022M KCl, 0.0067M Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.0020M KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.05% v/\nw polysorbate\n 20, pH 7.2). Wells were blocked with 200 μL/well of Blocking Buffer (PBS-Tween plus 1% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 60 minutes at room temperature (RT), aspirated and the plates washed twice with 300 μL/well of PBS-Tween. Wells were incubated with 362.78-CHO (Ab1, ZGI produced in CHO cells, lot #E10569) at a concentration of 1 μg/nm (in 1% BSA in PBS-Tween). After 1 hour incubation at RT, wells were aspirated and the plates washed twice as described above. Serial 10-fold dilutions (in 1% BSA in PBS-Tween) of the antisera (Ab2) were prepared beginning with an initial dilution of 1:1000 and ranging to 1:1,000,000. Duplicate samples of each dilution were then transferred to the assay plate, 100 μL/well. Normal mouse sera served as a negative control. Following a 1 hour incubation at RT, the wells were aspirated and the plates washed twice as described above. Goat anti-mouse IgG, Fc specific, HRP conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:5000 was then added to the wells, 100 μL/well. Following a 1 hour incubation at RT, unbound detection antibody was aspirated from the wells and the plates washed twice. After the aspiration, 100 μL/well of tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.) was added to each well and the plates incubated for 1 minutes at RT. Color development was stopped by the addition of 100 μL/well of Stop Reagent (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.) and the absorbance values of the wells read on a Molecular Devices Spectra MAX 340 instrument at 450 nm.\n\n\nNeutralization Assay: The ability of mouse anti-362.78-CHO anti-idiotype antibodies (Ab2) in the antisera to inhibit (neutralize) the binding activity of 362.78-CHO (Ab1) was assessed using a plate based neutralization assay. In this assay, wells of 96-well polystyrene ELISA plates were first coated with 100 μL/well of human IL-21 ligand (lot #A1207F) at a concentration of 1 μg/mL in Coating Buffer (0.1M Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, pH 9.6). Plates were incubated overnight at 4° C., after which unbound ligand was aspirated and the plates washed twice with 300 μL/well of Wash Buffer (PBS-Tween defined as 0.137M NaCl, 0.0022M KCl, 0.0067M Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.0020M KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.05% v/\nw polysorbate\n 20, pH 7.2). Wells were blocked with 200 μL/well of Blocking Buffer (PBS-Tween plus 1% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA)) for 1 hour, after which the plates were washed twice with Wash Buffer. Serial 10-fold dilutions (in 1% BSA in PBS-Tween) of the antisera (Ab2) were prepared beginning with an initial dilution of 1:100 and ranging to 1:100,000. Normal mouse sera served as a negative control. Duplicate samples of each dilution were then transferred to a 96-well dilution plate, 100 μL/well. Ab1 was added as a 2× solution, 100 μL/well. Following a 45 minute incubation at RT, 100 μL/well was transferred to the assay plate after the Blocking Buffer was aspirated. Following a 1 hour incubation at RT, the wells were aspirated and the plates washed twice as described above. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled Goat anti Human IgG, Fc specific, HRP conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.) at a dilution of 1:5000 was then added to each well, 100 μL/well, and the plates incubated at RT for 1 hour. After removal of unbound detection antibody, the plates were washed twice, 100 μL/well of tetra methyl benzidine (TMB) (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.) added to each well and the plates incubated for 2 minutes at RT. Color development was stopped by the addition of 100 μL/well of Stop Reagent (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.) and the absorbance values of the wells read on a Molecular Devices Spectra MAX 340 instrument at 450 nm.\n\n\nFusion: Two mice with the highest anti-362.78-CHO neutralization titers were immunized a final time with approximately 50 μg of 362.78-CHO (Ab1) in PBS without adjuvant via subcutaneous injection. Four days later, the spleen and lymph nodes of these mice were harvested. Electrofusion was performed using standard methods known in the art to fuse lymphocytes with mouse myeloma P3-X63-Ag8.653 cells (American Type Culture Collection, CRL 1580) at a 1:1 lymphocyte-myeloma ratio, using the Cyto-pulse CEEF-50 apparatus (Cyto Pulse Sciences Inc., Glen Burnie, Md.). The fusion mixture was distributed into 96-well flat-bottomed plates. Wells of the fusion plates were fed three times with a 70% replacement of hybridoma growth medium (IMDM with 1× L-glutamine (100×), 1× Penicillin-Streptomycin (100×), all from Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., 10% Fetalclone1 serum non-heat inactivated (HyClone, Logan, Utah), 10% Hybridoma Cloning Factor (BM Condimed H1 Roche Diagnostic, Indianapolis, Ind.), 1×HAT supplement (50×, Gibco Invitrogen). Wells were assayed ten days after plating of the fusion.\n\n\nSelection of Master Wells: The 96-well fusion plates were screened for the presence of mouse anti-362.78-CHO idiotype antibodies using a capture style ELISA as described above except that hybridoma supernatants were tested undiluted from the culture plates. Hybridoma cells of positive wells were successfully expanded into culture in 24-well plates. When the density of the 24-well cultures was approximately 4-6×10\n5 \ncells/mL, the supernatant (approximately 1.5 mL) was individually collected and stored for each well and the cells from each well cryopreserved. Freezing medium consisted of 90\n% Fetalclone\n 1 serum and 10% DMSO. Each of the 24-well supernatants was reanalyzed in both the capture ELISA and plate based neutralization ELISA assay described above. Results indicated that following expansion all of the master well supernatants had retained their ability to recognize 362.78-CHO antibody (Ab1) in solution. Seven of the master well supernatants retained their ability to neutralize the binding of Ab1 to human IL-21 ligand.\n\n\nCloning: Cells from 5 master wells were chosen according to their neutralizing activity and cloned in hybridoma growth medium supplemented with 1×HT (100×, Gibco Invitrogen) in order to isolate a clonal hybridoma producing the neutralizing mAb of interest. Cells were cloned in 96-well microtiter cell culture plates using a standard low-density dilution (less than 1 cell per well) approach and monoclonality was assessed by microscopic examination of wells for a single foci of growth prior to assay. Six days post-plating, all plates were screened by the neutralization ELISA for anti-362.78-CHO anti-idiotype inhibiting antibodies. Hybridoma cells from positive wells were successfully expanded into 24-well plates.\n\n\nSelection of First Round Clones: Supernatants from approximately 6 wells of each cloned hybridoma line that were positive for specific mAb and originated from wells with only a single colony of hybridoma growth were collected from each cloning set and rescreened at various dilutions in the neutralization ELISA to identify a best neutralizing mAb producing clone. When the density of a best clone of the 24-well cultures were approximately 4-6×10\n5 \ncells/mL, the supernatant was individually collected and stored for each well and the cells from each well cryopreserved.\n\n\nSummary: mouse monoclonal antibodies (Ab2) reactive against the recombinantly expressed 362.78-CHO antibody (Ab1) were generated and exhibit neutralizing activity capable of blocking the binding of 362.78-CHO antibody to human IL-21. These antibodies can be used as reagents in pre-clinical and clinical immunoassays.\n\n\nExample 19\n\n\nBinding of Native Intracellular Human and Cynomolgus Monkey IL-21 (but not Mouse or Rat IL-21) by IL-21 mAb 362.78.1.44\n\n\nThe neutralizing anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies described herein were generated from transgenic mice expressing human immunoglobulin genes and immunized with recombinant human IL-21 (see Example 1). It was important to confirm that the IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 can bind and neutralize native human IL-21 in addition to the recombinant form of the IL-21. Additionally, in order to support preclinical toxicology studies, it is helpful to understand the binding capacity of the IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 to native IL-21 in a variety of species. In order to test this, one approach is to label IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 with a fluorescent dye and use it to detect intracellular IL-21 in activated T cells by flow cytometry. In this study, freshly isolated human and cynomolgus monkey peripheral blood leukocytes as well as rat and mouse splenocytes were activated in vitro with PMA and ionomycin for 24 hours to induce IL-21 production. Cells were harvested, fixed, permeabilized and stained for expression of CD3 or CD4 (to define helper T cell populations) and IL-21 using the IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 labeled with ALEXA FLUOR-647 (AF-647), and compared to the staining intensity induced by an isotype-matched control antibody. A positive signal in this assay, above that observed for the isotype control mAb, demonstrates specific IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 binding to endogenous IL-21 in the test species, though it is not an indicator of IL-21 neutralizing activity. Further studies are required to demonstrate IL-21 neutralization in a species that tests positive for IL-21 binding with the anti-human IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 (see Example 20).\n\n\nIsolation of human PBMC: 100 mL peripheral blood was collected from healthy human volunteers (ZymoGenetics) in green top heparin Vacutainer tubes (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif.). Blood was diluted with 100 mL of room temperature PBS and 35 mL aliquots were distributed into 50 mL conical tubes. 14 mL of room temperature Ficoll/Paque PLUS (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was underlaid and the tubes were spun for 20 minutes at 2000 rpm. The PBMC interface layer was removed and washed two times with assay media (RPMI 1640 with supplemental Penicillin/Streptomycin, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, Sodium Pyruvate, 2 μM β-Mercaptoethanol, all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Viable cells were counted in trypan blue using standard techniques.\n\n\nIsolation of cynomolgus monkey PBMC: 40 mL peripheral blood was collected in green-top heparin Vacutainer blood collection tubes (BD Biosciences) from a cymomolgus monkey housed at the University of Washington in Seattle. Blood was diluted with 40 mL of room temperature PBS and 35 mL aliquots were distributed into 50 mL conical tubes. Fourteen mL of room temperature Ficoll/Paque PLUS (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was underlaid and the tubes were spun for 25 minutes at 2000 rpm. The PBMC interface layer was removed and washed two times with assay media (RPMI 1640 with supplemental Penicillin/Streptomycin, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, Sodium Pyruvate, 2 μM β-Mercaptoethanol). Viable cells were counted in trypan blue using standard techniques.\n\n\nIsolation of murine and rat splenocytes: Both rat and mouse splenocytes were prepared according to the following protocol. A freshly collected spleen was gently disrupted to a single cell suspension using the ends of two frosted glass slides. Cells were then passed through a 70-μM nylon mesh filter to remove clumps. Red blood cells were lysed by resuspending the cell pellet in 2 mL ACK lysis buffer for 10 minutes at room temperature. This reaction was stopped by the addition of assay media, the cells were then centrifuged (1200 RPM for 5 minutes), resuspended and passed over another nylon mesh filter to remove debris. Viable cells were counted in trypan blue using standard techniques.\n\n\nOvernight activation of cells with PMA and ionomycin: Cells from all species were resuspended at 2.0×10e6 cells per mL. One mL of cells was then plated with or without the addition of 20 ng/mL PMA and 200 ng/mL ionomycin into a 24-well plate and incubated at 37° C. for 20 hours in a humidified 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator. After 20 hours, 1.0 μl of GolgiPlug (BD Pharmingen) was added to each well and the cells were incubated an additional four hours.\n\n\nCell harvest and surface stain: Following the 24-hour incubation described above, cells were harvested, washed with cold FACS buffer and plated at 2.0×10\n5\n-5.0×10e5 cells per well in a 96-well tissue culture plate (Becton Dickinson and Co., Franklin Lakes, N.J.). Cells were then stained with 1 μl/mL of one or more of the following antibodies, as appropriate: anti-murine CD4-PE, anti-rat CD3-PE, anti-rat B220-PE, or anti-monkey CD4-PE, or anti-human CD4-PE for 20 minutes on ice. Cells were then washed two times in PBS in preparation for fixation.\n\n\nCell fixation and permeabilization: To fix cells, each cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μL of 2% paraformaldehyde and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Cells were then centrifuged (5 minutes at 1200 rpm) and the supernatants aspirated, and the cells were resuspended in a permeabilization buffer [PBS supplemented with 0.1% saponin (Calbiochem) and 0.5% BSA (Sigma)] for 10 minutes at room temperature.\n\n\nIntracellular stain: Following fixation and permeabilization, cells were stained with ˜1 μg/mL of one of the following labeled antibodies: anti-mouse IL-21-AF647, anti-human IL-21 clone 362.78.1.44-AF647 (both produced at ZymoGenetics) or a comparator anti-human IL-21-AF647 antibody from BD Pharmingen. Cells were then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 40 minutes. After 40 minutes, the cells were washed twice with FACS buffer (HBSS supplemented with 1% BSA, 2% Human AB serum and 0.05% HEPES)\n\n\nData acquisition and analysis: Upon completion of staining and washing, cells were resuspended in 400 μL FACS buffer and data were collected using a FACS Calibur (BD Pharmingen) running CellQuest software. Data were analyzed using FCS Express data analysis software (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, Calif.).\n\n\nResults: Detection of human IL-21 in PMA+ionomycin stimulated human T cells: While only 0.015% of the CD3+ T cells stained positive using the isotype control, approximately 9% of the CD4+ T cells stained positive for IL-21 using the IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 labeled with AF-647. The same fraction of IL-21+ cells was detected using the commercially available IL-21 mAb from eBiosciences. This demonstrates that the IL-21 mAb can bind endogenously produced IL-21 in human CD4+ T cells.\n\n\nDetection of cynomolgus monkey IL-21 in PMA+ionomycin stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells: Approximately 3.6% of the CD3+ cyno T cells stained positive for IL-21 using the IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 labeled with AF-647, compared to 0.1% positive using the isotype control. This number is higher than that detected using a commercially available anti-human IL-21 mAb from eBiosciences. This discrepancy may be due to a weaker binding affinity of the eBiosciences antibody for cynomolgus IL-21. These results demonstrate that the anti-human IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 can bind endogenously produced IL-21 in cynomolgus monkey CD3+ T cells.\n\n\nDetection of murine IL-21 in PMA+ionomycin stimulated splenocytes: Using a rat anti-murine IL-21 monoclonal antibody generated at ZymoGenetics as a positive control, approximately 13.5% of the activated mouse CD4+ T cells were positive for IL-21. However, as predicted from western blots and neutralizing bioactivity assays showing that the anti-human IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 does not bind or neutralize mouse IL-21 (see Examples 3 and 9), the anti-human IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 labeled with AF647 did not detect any IL-21-positive cells. This further demonstrates that the anti-human IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 does not bind to murine IL-21.\n\n\nDetection of rat IL-21 in PMA+ionomycin stimulated splenocytes: Rat splenocytes were stimulated overnight in the presence of PMA and ionomycin. These stimulation conditions were sufficient to produce IL-21 positive T cells in human, cynomolgus monkey and murine T cells. In this experiment, neither the anti-mouse IL-21 mAb nor the anti-human IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 detected any cells that were positive for IL-21. However, because there was no positive control in this experiment, this negative result does not conclusively eliminate the possibility that the anti-human IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 can bind to rat IL-21. However, these data, considered along with the lack of neutralization of rat IL-21 bioactivity by the anti-human IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 in other assays (see Example 9), does strongly suggest that this mAb probably does not bind rat IL-21.\n\n\nConclusion: The IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 described herein clearly binds to the native human and cynomolgus monkey forms of the IL-21 protein but not to murine or rat IL-21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAnti-human IL-21\n\n\nAnti-IL-21 Positive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\n\n\nIsotype control\n\n\nmAb (clone 78)\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman\n\n\n0.015% of CD3+ T cells\n\n\n9% of CD3+ T cells were\n\n\n10% of CD3+ T cells were IL-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nstained positive with an\n\n\nIL-21+\n\n\n21+ (eBiosciences αIL-21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhIgG4-AF647 control\n\n\n \n\n\nmAb*)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCynomolgus\n\n\n0.1% of CD3+ T cells\n\n\n3.6% of CD3+ T cells were\n\n\n0.2% of CD3+ T cells were\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonkey\n\n\nstained positive with an\n\n\nIL-21+\n\n\nIL-21+*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhIgG4-AF647 control\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse\n\n\nNo isotype control used\n\n\nNone detected\n\n\n13.5% of CD4+ T cells were\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIL-21+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRat\n\n\nNo isotype control used\n\n\nNone detected\n\n\nNot available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*(this mAb may not bind strongly to cyno IL-21)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 20\n\n\nBinding and Neutralization of Native Human IL-21 Bioactivity by Clone 362.78.1.44\n\n\nThe neutralizing anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies (IL-21 mAb) described herein were generated from transgenic mice expressing human immunoglobulin genes and immunized with recombinant human IL-21 (see Example 1). It was important to confirm that the IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 can bind and neutralize native human IL-21 in addition to the recombinant form of IL-21. To demonstrate neutralization of native IL-21, the Baf3/IL-21R pSTAT cell-based assay previously described (see Example 7) was utilized and activated CD4+ T cell conditioned media samples were used as the source of native IL-21. In this experiment, T cell conditioned media samples were preincubated with varying amounts of IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44 and the level of IL-21-induced STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) in the Baf3/hIL-21R transfectants was then measured. Neutralization of native IL-21 was demonstrated using activated T cell conditioned media samples from four separate healthy human donors.\n\n\nIsolation of human PBMC and generation of T cell conditioned media samples: 100 mL of peripheral blood was collected from 4 healthy human volunteers (ZymoGenetics) in green top heparin Vacutainer tubes (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif.). Blood was then diluted with 100 mL of room temperature PBS and 35 mL aliquots were distributed into 50 mL conical tubes. 14 mL of room temperature Ficoll/Paque PLUS (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was underlaid and the tubes were spun for 20 minutes at 2000 rpm. The PBMC interface layer was removed and washed two times with assay media (RPMI 1640 with supplemental Penicillin/Streptinomycin, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, Sodium Pyruvate, 2 μM β-Mercaptoethanol, all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) Viable cells were counted in trypan blue using standard techniques. T cells were negatively selected using a Human CD4+ T Cell Selection Kit from Miltenyi Biotec (Auburn, Calif.) following the protocol outlined by the manufacturer. Using standard immunophenotyping techniques, the CD4+ T cells were subsequently determined to be >95% pure by flow cytometry. T cells were then incubated for three days at 5×10e5 cells per well in a 24-well plate pre-coated with 5.0 μg/mL anti-CD3 antibody in Th1 skewing media containing 5.0 μg/mL anti-IFNγ, 1.0 μg/mL anti-CD28 (all from Becton Dickinson) and 10 ng/mL recombinant IL-12 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.). After three days, cells were washed, re-plated in media containing 25 ng/mL PMA and 500 ng/mL ionomycin and incubated for five hours at 37° C. After five hours, conditioned media samples were harvested and frozen and stored at −80° C. until day of experiment.\n\n\nTo estimate the approximate IL-21 concentration in the T cell conditioned media samples, 1:4 serial dilutions were prepared and tested for induction of STAT3 phosphorylation in the Baf3/hIL-21R transfectants. Following the 10 minute pSTAT3 bioassay protocol outlined in Example 7, the relative concentration of IL-21 in each conditioned media sample was estimated by comparing the level of pSTAT3 to that generated using a titration of recombinant IL-21. Using these data, the concentration of IL-21 in each of the four conditioned media samples was determined to be between 5.0 and 10.0 ng/mL.\n\n\nTo demonstrate neutralization of native IL-21-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, 1:10 dilutions (final IL-21 concentrations between 0.5 and 1.0 ng/mL) of the four T cell conditioned media samples were preincubated for 30 minutes at 37° C. with a 1:4 serial dilution of IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44. The concentration of clone 362.78.1.44 ranged from 0.4 to 400 ng/mL. After 30 minutes, the conditioned media+IL-21 mAb samples were transferred to the Baf3/hIL-21R cell plate and incubated for an additional 10 minutes at 37° C. After 10 minutes, the reactions were stopped with cold wash buffer, cells lysed and amount of pSTAT3 measured using the method described in Example 7.\n\n\nIn all four conditioned media samples, the clone 362.78.1.44 IL-21 mAb effectively neutralized IL-21 activity (data summarized in Table 15). These data clearly demonstrate effective binding to and neutralization of native human IL-21 by clone 362.78.1.44.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutralization of native IL-21 by IL-21 mAb clone 362.78.1.44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21 mAb Conc.\n\n\npSTAT3 induction (fold over background)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ng/mL)\n\n\n \nDonor\n 1\n\n\n \nDonor\n 2\n\n\n \nDonor\n 3\n\n\nDonor 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n69.49\n\n\n56.32\n\n\n61.11\n\n\n62.73\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n70.84\n\n\n61.73\n\n\n68.24\n\n\n65.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.25\n\n\n70.76\n\n\n10.46\n\n\n7.51\n\n\n60.65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n2.16\n\n\n1.62\n\n\n1.70\n\n\n2.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n168\n\n\n1.43\n\n\n1.51\n\n\n1.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n1.59\n\n\n1.30\n\n\n1.14\n\n\n1.51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 21\n\n\n21A. Pilot Toxicity Study with IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO in Cynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\nThe epitope specificity of IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO is shared by humans, rhesus and cynomolgus macaques (see Examples 17 and 17b), therefore tolerability and toxicity of IL-21 mAb was tested in cynomolgus monkeys, a relevant species for safety assessment.\n\n\nCynomolgus monkeys were treated with a single injection of IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO and monitored for clinical signs for 4 to 8 weeks following treatment. The IL-21 mAb was delivered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection at doses of 5 or 100 mg/kg. No clinical signs were observed. No meaningful changes in body weight or coagulation were observed. No changes in serum chemistry or hematology attributable to drug toxicity were observed. The single treatment with IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO at 5 or 100 mg/kg was well tolerated by all of the animals.\n\n\nNecropsy was performed on the high-dose (100 mg/kg) animals. No gross anatomic changes were observed. Histopathology analysis of the high-dose animals showed minimal lymphoid hyperplasia in lymphoid tissues. Immunohistochemistry analysis of lymphoid tissues showed a moderate increase in follicle size and in follicle-associated cell types. These changes could relate to the pharmacological activity of IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO, since IL-21 is known to directly affect the development and egress of B cells from lymphoid follicles and to support class switch, affinity maturation and plasma cell development.\n\n\nPharmacokinetic behavior and bioavailability of IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO was monitored in a single dose study in cynomolgus monkeys. Eight male cynomolgus monkeys were treated with IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO. Three were treated by subcutaneous injection of 5 mg/kg and three were treated by intravenous injection of 5 mg/kg. Two were treated by intravenous injection of 100 mg/kg. Serum samples were taken for analysis of IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO levels during four weeks following treatment for the 100 mg/kg group and during eight weeks following treatment for the two 5 mg/kg groups. Noncompartmental analysis of pharmacokinetic profiles showed that exposure increased in a dose-proportional manner with intravenous administration of 5 or 100 mg/kg IL-21 mAb. Bioavailability of IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO was approximately 50% following subcutaneous administration. The estimated terminal half-life for L-21 mAb was 10-14 days. The estimated terminal half-life of IL-21 mAb*insert: 362.78-CHO in cynomolgus monkeys was 10-14 days.\n\n\n21B. Pilot Pharmacology Study with 362.78-CHO in Cynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\nThe epitope specificity of IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO is shared by humans, rhesus and cynomolgus macaques (see Examples 17 and 17b), therefore in vivo pharmacology of IL-21 mAb was tested in cynomolgus monkeys, a relevant species for phamacodynamic assessment.\n\n\nCynomolgus monkeys were treated with a single injection of IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO and monitored for clinical signs for 4 to 8 weeks following treatment. The IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO was delivered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection at doses of 5 or 100 mg/kg. All animals were monitored for changes in peripheral blood leukocyte composition by flow cytometry. No treatment-related changes in monocyte or B cell concentration, and no changes in T cell CD4 and CD8 subsets, nor in the ratio of CD4 to CD8 cells, were observed. A reduction in the NK cell concentration was observed following IL-21 mAb 362.78-CHO administration. In all treatment groups, peripheral blood NK cells were decreased at 24 h post-treatment, relative to the baseline values. In five of the eight animals, NK levels remained below 60% of the baseline value for at least two weeks. A confirmatory study with adequate controls for handling stress and other sources of variability in peripheral blood NK cell concentration will be required to confirm this observation.\n\n\nExample 22\n\n\nAnti-mIL-21 Antibody Decreases Disease Incidence and Progression in Mouse Collagen Induced Arthritis (CIA) Model\n\n\nMouse Collagen Induced Arthritis (CIA) Model:\n\n\nThere are several animal models for rheumatoid arthritis known in the art. For example, in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model, mice develop chronic inflammatory arthritis that closely resembles human rheumatoid arthritis. Since CIA shares similar immunological and pathological features with RA, this makes it an ideal model for screening potential human anti-inflammatory compounds. The CIA model is a well-known model in mice that depends on both an immune response, and an inflammatory response, in order to occur. The immune response comprises the interaction of B-cells and CD4+ T-cells in response to collagen, which is given as antigen, and leads to the production of anti-collagen antibodies. The inflammatory phase is the result of tissue responses from mediators of inflammation, as a consequence of some of these antibodies cross-reacting to the mouse's native collagen and activating the complement cascade. An advantage in using the CIA model is that the basic mechanisms of pathogenesis are known. The relevant T-cell and B-cell epitopes on type II collagen have been identified, and various immunological (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity and anti-collagen antibody) and inflammatory (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, and matrix-degrading enzymes) parameters relating to immune-mediated arthritis have been determined, and can thus be used to assess test compound efficacy in the CIA model (Wooley, \nCurr. Opin. Rheum. \n3:407-20, 1999; Williams et al., \nImmunol. \n89:9784-788, 1992; Myers et al., \nLife Sci. \n61:1861-78, 1997; and Wang et al., \nImmunol. \n92:8955-959, 1995). The potential efficacy of a rat anti-mouse IL-21 mAb produced at ZymoGenetics was tested in the CIA model, as described below.\n\n\nTen-week old male DBA/1J mice (Jackson Labs) were used for therapeutic dosing (i.e. as mice get established disease). On day −21, all animals were given an intradermal tail injection of 100 microliters of 1 mg/mL chick Type II collagen formulated in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (prepared by Chondrex, Redmond, Wash.), and three weeks later on \nDay\n 0 they were given the same injection except prepared in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant. An anti-IL-21 antibody or vehicle (PBS) was administered as an intraperitoneal injection every other day for a total of 6 doses as soon as a mouse developed established disease. Mice (n=7 per treatment) received either 0.15 mg of an anti-IL-21 antibody per animal per dose, or the vehicle control, PBS (Life Technologies, Rockville, Md.). Animals began to show symptoms of arthritis following the second collagen injection, with most animals developing inflammation within 1-2 weeks. The extent of disease was evaluated in each paw by using a caliper to measure paw thickness, and by assigning a clinical score (0-3) to each paw (see below).\n\n\nMonitoring Disease:\n\n\nAnimals can begin to show signs of paw inflammation soon after the second collagen injection, and some animals may even begin to have signs of toe inflammation prior to the second collagen injection. Most animals develop arthritis within 1-2 weeks of the boost injection, but some may require a longer period of time. Incidence of disease in this model is typically 90-100%, and 0-5 non-responders (determined after 6 weeks of observation) are typically seen in a study using 60 animals. Since this study only included mice with established disease, mice that did not develop arthritis were not used. Note that as inflammation begins, a common transient occurrence of variable low-grade paw or toe inflammation can occur. For this reason, an animal was not considered to have established disease until marked, persistent paw swelling had developed.\n\n\nAll animals were observed daily to assess the status of the disease in their paws, which was done by assigning a qualitative clinical score to each of the paws. Every day, each animal had its 4 paws scored according to its state of clinical disease. To determine the clinical score, the paw can be thought of as having 3 zones, the toes, the paw itself (manus or pes), and the wrist or ankle joint. The extent and severity of the inflammation relative to these zones was taken into account including: observation of each toe for swelling; torn nails or redness of toes; notation of any evidence of edema or redness in any of the paws; notation of any loss of fine anatomic demarcation of tendons or bones; evaluation of the wrist or ankle for any edema or redness; and notation if the inflammation extends proximally up the leg. A paw score of 1, 2, or 3 was based first on the overall impression of severity, and second on how many zones were involved. The scale used for clinical scoring is shown below.\n\n\nClinical Score:\n\n\n0=Normal\n\n\n0.5=One or more toes involved, but only the toes are inflamed\n\n\n1=mild inflammation involving the paw (1 zone), and may include a toe or toes\n\n\n2=moderate inflammation in the paw and may include some of the toes and/or the wrist/ankle (2 zones)\n\n\n3=severe inflammation in the paw, wrist/ankle, and some or all of the toes (3 zones)\n\n\nEstablished disease was defined as a qualitative score of paw inflammation ranking 1 or more, that persisted for two days in a row. Once established disease was present, the date was recorded and designated as that animal's first day with “established disease”.\n\n\nMice receiving an anti-mIL-21 antibody were characterized by a reductions in paw swelling over the course of the experiment and had an approximately 25% lower average arthritis score compared to mice receiving PBS. These results indicate that an anti-mIL-21 antibody reduced paw swelling and disease progression associated with this model of arthritis and suggest that an anti-IL-21 antibody may be efficacious in the treatment of human arthritis.\n\n\nExample 23\n\n\nExpression of IL-21R in Human Psoriatic Skin Samples\n\n\nExpression of IL-21R is generally limited to cells of hematopoietic origin. However, in settings of inflammatory disease, IL-21R expression on non-hematopoietic cells may provide a direct stimulus to cell types that mediate the functional changes in the affected tissues. In psoriasis, keratinocyte growth is dysregulated, with psoriaform epidermal hyperplasia, aberrant terminal differentiation, and incomplete development of the stratum corneum. The IL-21 produced by infiltrating Th1 and Th17 cells in psoriatic skin could promote functional changes in keratinocytes, including cell proliferation, production of chemokines, and altered differentiation. The presence of IL-21R on keratinocytes in psoriatic skin lesions was therefore investigated.\n\n\nMethods: Immunohistochemistry analysis of 18 skin biopsy samples from 4 normal human donors and 9 patients with psoriasis was performed, using a mouse IgG1 antibody against human IL-21R produced at ZymoGenetics. For the psoriasis patients, a subset (5) provided samples from both lesional and non-lesional skin. A high degree of epidermal hyperplasia was noted in histopathology examination of the lesional skin from all donors. Immunoreactivity (staining) of IL-21R on specific cell types was scored based on frequency of positive cells and intensity of staining.\n\n\nResults: In normal skin and in non-lesional skin of psoriasis patients, staining for IL-21R was positive on occasional intra-epidermal mononuclear (MNC), scattered macrophages and fibroblast-like cells. Positive staining for IL-21R was present on high numbers of MNC in all of the lesional samples from psoriasis patients. Samples stained with a mouse isotype control antibody were negative. Minimal or no staining for IL-21R was present on epidermal keratinocytes from normal skin. In non-lesional skin biopsies from psoriasis patients, mild staining was observed in epidermal keratinocytes in 4 samples, and moderate staining was observed in the stratum spinosum in the fifth sample. There was mild to strong staining of focal areas of keratinocytes in the lesional samples from 8 of the 9 psoriasis patients.\n\n\nConclusion: In psoriatic skin lesions, the expression of IL-21R is not limited to infiltrating leukocytes but is also up-regulated on epidermal keratinocytes. The presence of increased staining for IL-21R on epidermal keratinocytes in non-lesional skin from psoriasis patients, compared with normal controls, suggests that even in non-involved skin, the keratinocytes may respond aberrantly to IL-21 stimulation. In the presence of inflammation, increased IL-21R on infiltrating MNC and in the hyperplastic epidermal layer was noted. Treatment of psoriasis with an IL-21 blocking antibody may therefore inhibit inflammation by blocking IL-21 signals to both inflammatory cells and epidermal keratinocytes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21R Immunoreactivity\n1 \nin Normal, Non-Lesional,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand Lesional Psoriatic Skin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSkin Type (N)\n\n\nEpidermis\n2\n \n\n\nMNC\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNormal (4)\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPsoriasis Non-Lesional (5)\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPsoriasis Lesional\n3 \n(9)\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n1\nScale: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = strong for IL-21R expression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n2\nMedian score of all samples tested\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n3\nFive of the samples had donor-matched non-lesional skin biopsies"

No. 6,432,975, each of which is fully incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions incorporating compounds capable of affecting nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptors (nAChRs), for example, as modulators of specific nicotinic receptor subtypes (specifically, the α7 nAChR subtype). The present invention also relates to methods for treating a wide variety of conditions and disorders, particularly those associated with dysfunction of the central and autonomic nervous systems.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nNicotine has been proposed to have a number of pharmacological effects. See, for example, Pullan et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n330:811 (1994). Certain of those effects may be related to effects upon neurotransmitter release. See, for example, Sjak-shie et al., \nBrain Res. \n624:295 (1993), where neuroprotective effects of nicotine are proposed. Release of acetylcholine and dopamine by neurons, upon administration of nicotine, has been reported by Rowell et al., \nJ. Neurochem. \n43:1593 (1984); Rapier et al., \nJ. Neurochem. \n50:1123 (1988); Sandor et al., \nBrain Res. \n567:313 (1991) and Vizi, Br. \nJ. Pharmacol. \n47:765 (1973). Release of norepinephrine by neurons, upon administration of nicotine, has been reported by Hall et al., \nBiochem. Pharmacol. \n21:1829 (1972). Release of serotonin by neurons, upon administration of nicotine, has been reported by Hery et al., \nArch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. \n296:91 (1977). Release of glutamate by neurons, upon administration of nicotine, has been reported by Toth et al., \nNeurochem Res. \n17:265 (1992). Confirmatory reports and additional recent studies have included the modulation, in the central nervous system (CNS), of glutamate, nitric oxide, GABA, tachykinins, cytokines, and peptides (reviewed in Brioni et al., \nAdv. Pharmacol. \n37:153 (1997)). In addition, nicotine reportedly potentiates the pharmacological behavior of certain pharmaceutical compositions used for the treatment of certain disorders. See, for example, Sanberg et al., \nPharmacol. Biochem\n. & \nBehavior \n46:303 (1993); Harsing et al., \nJ. Neurochem. \n59:48 (1993) and Hughes, \nProceedings from Intl. Symp. Nic\n. S40 (1994). Furthermore, various other beneficial pharmacological effects of nicotine have been proposed. See, for example, Decina et al., \nBiol. Psychiatry \n28:502 (1990); Wagner et al., \nPharmacopsychiatry \n21:301 (1988); Pomerleau et al., \nAddictive Behaviors \n9:265 (1984); Onaivi et al., \nLife Sci. \n54(3):193 (1994); Tripathi et al., \nJPET \n221:91 (1982) and Hamon, \nTrends in Pharmacol. Res. \n15:36 (1994).\n\n\nVarious compounds that target nAChRs have been reported as being useful for treating a wide variety of conditions and disorders. See, for example, Williams et al., \nDN\n&\nP \n7(4):205 (1994); Arneric et al., \nCNS Drug Rev. \n1(1):1 (1995); Arneric et al., \nExp. Opin. Invest. Drugs \n5(1):79 (1996); Bencherif et al., \nJPET \n279:1413 (1996); Lippiello et al., \nJPET \n279:1422 (1996); Damaj et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n291:390 (1999); Chiari et al., \nAnesthesiology \n91:1447 (1999); Lavand'homme and Eisenbach, \nAnesthesiology \n91:1455 (1999); Holladay et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n40(28): 4169 (1997); Bannon et al., \nScience \n279: 77 (1998); PCT WO 94/08992, PCT WO 96/31475, PCT WO 96/40682, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,583,140 to Bencherif et al., 5,597,919 to Dull et al., 5,604,231 to Smith et al., and 5,852,041 to Cosford et al. Nicotinic compounds are reported as being particularly useful for treating a wide variety of CNS disorders. Indeed, a wide variety of compounds have been reported to have therapeutic properties. See, for example, Bencherif and Schmitt, \nCurrent Drug Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders \n1(4): 349 (2002), Levin and Rezvani, \nCurrent Drug Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders \n1(4): 423 (2002), O'Neill et al., \nCurrent Drug Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders \n1(4): 399 (2002), U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,1871,166 to Kikuchi et al., 5,672,601 to Cignarella, PCT WO 99/21834, and PCT WO 97/40049, UK Patent Application GB 2295387, and European Patent Application 297,858.\n\n\nCNS disorders are a type of neurological disorder. CNS disorders can be drug induced; can be attributed to genetic predisposition, infection or trauma; or can be of unknown etiology. CNS disorders comprise neuropsychiatric disorders, neurological diseases and mental illnesses, and include neurodegenerative diseases, behavioral disorders, cognitive disorders and cognitive affective disorders. There are several CNS disorders whose clinical manifestations have been attributed to CNS dysfunction (i.e., disorders resulting from inappropriate levels of neurotransmitter release, inappropriate properties of neurotransmitter receptors, and/or inappropriate interaction between neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter receptors). Several CNS disorders can be attributed to a deficiency of choline, dopamine, norepinephrine and/or serotonin. Relatively common CNS disorders include pre-senile dementia (early-onset Alzheimer's disease), senile dementia (dementia of the Alzheimer's type), micro-infarct dementia, AIDS-related dementia, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, Pick's disease, Parkinsonism including Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington's chorea, tardive dyskinesia, hyperkinesia, mania, attention deficit disorder, anxiety, dyslexia, schizophrenia, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders and Tourette's syndrome.\n\n\nThe nAChRs characteristic of the CNS have been shown to occur in several subtypes, the most common of which are the α4β2 and α7 subtypes. See, for example, Schmitt, \nCurrent Med. Chem. \n7: 749 (2000). Ligands that interact with the α7 nAChR subtype have been proposed to be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia. There are a decreased number of hippocampal nAChRs in postmortem brain tissue of schizophrenic patients. Also, there is improved psychological effect in smoking versus non-smoking schizophrenic patients. Nicotine improves sensory gating deficits in animals and schizophrenics. Blockade of the α7 nAChR subtype induces a gating deficit similar to that seen in schizophrenia. See, for example, Leonard et al., \nSchizophrenia Bulletin \n22(3): 431 (1996). Biochemical, molecular, and genetic studies of sensory processing, in patients with the P50 auditory-evoked potential gating deficit, suggest that the α7 nAChR subtype may function in an inhibitory neuronal pathway. See, for example, Freedman et al., \nBiological Psychiatry \n38(1):22 (1995).\n\n\nMore recently, α7 nAChRs have been proposed to be mediators of angiogenesis, as described by Heeschen et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n100: 527 (2002). In these studies, inhibition of the α7 subtype was shown to decrease inflammatory angiogenesis. Also, α7 nAChRs have been proposed as targets for controlling neurogenesis and tumor growth (Utsugisawa et al., \nMolecular Brain Research \n106(1-2): 88 (2002) and U.S. Patent Application 2002/0016371). Finally, the role of the α7 subtype in cognition (Levin and Rezvani, \nCurrent Drug Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders \n1(4): 423 (2002)), neuroprotection (O'Neill et al., \nCurrent Drug Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders \n1(4): 399 (2002) and Jeyarasasingam et al., \nNeuroscience \n109(2): 275 (2002)), and neuropathic pain (Xiao et al., \nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci\n. (US) 99(12): 8360 (2002)) has recently been recognized.\n\n\nVarious compounds have been reported to interact with α7 nAChRs and have been proposed as therapies on that basis. See, for instance, PCT WO 99/62505, PCT WO 99/03859, PCT WO 97/30998, PCT WO 01/36417, PCT WO 02/15662, PCT WO 02/16355, PCT WO 02/16356, PCT WO 02/16357, PCT WO 02/16358, PCT WO 02/17358, Stevens et al., \nPsychopharm. \n136: 320 (1998), Dolle et al., \nJ. Labelled Comp. Radiopharm. \n44: 785 (2001) and Macor et al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. \n11: 319 (2001) and references therein. Among these compounds, a common structural theme is that of the substituted tertiary bicylic amine (e.g., quinuclidine). Similar substituted quinuclidine compounds have also been reported to bind at muscarinic receptors. See, for instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,270 to Sabb and PCTs WO 02/00652 and WO 02/051841.\n\n\nIt would be desirable to provide a useful method for the prevention and treatment of a condition or disorder by administering a nicotinic compound to a patient susceptible to or suffering from such a condition or disorder. It would be highly beneficial to provide individuals suffering from certain disorders (e.g., CNS diseases) with interruption of the symptoms of those disorders by the administration of a pharmaceutical composition containing an active ingredient having nicotinic pharmacology which has a beneficial effect (e.g., upon the functioning of the CNS), but does not provide any significant associated side effects. It would be highly desirable to provide a pharmaceutical composition incorporating a compound that interacts with nAChRs, such as those that have the potential to affect the functioning of the CNS. It would be highly desirable that such a compound, when employed in an amount sufficient to affect the functioning of the CNS, would not significantly affect those nAChR subtypes that have the potential to induce undesirable side effects (e.g., appreciable activity at cardiovascular and skeletal muscle receptor sites). In addition, it would be highly desirable to provide a pharmaceutical composition incorporating a compound which interacts with nicotinic receptors but not muscarinic receptors, as the latter are associated with side effects, such as hypersalivation, sweating, tremors, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disturbances, related to the function of the parasympathetic nervous system (see Caulfield, \nPharmacol. Ther. \n58: 319 (1993) and Broadley and Kelly, \nMolecules \n6: 142 (2001)). Furthermore, it would be highly desirable to provide pharmaceutical compositions, which are selective for the α7 nAChR subtype, for the treatment of certain conditions or disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, cognitive disorders, and neuropathic pain) and for the prevention of tissue damage and the hastening of healing (i.e., for neuroprotection and the control of angiogenesis). The present invention provides such compounds, compositions and methods.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to 3-substituted-2-(arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes, pharmaceutical compositions including the compounds, methods of preparing the compounds, and methods of treatment using the compounds. More specifically, the methods of treatment involve modulating the activity of the α7 nAChR subtype by administering one or more of the compounds to treat or prevent disorders mediated by the α7 nAChR subtype.\n\n\nThe azabicycloalkanes generally are azabicycloheptanes, azabicyclooctanes, or azabicyclononanes. The aryl group in the arylalkyl moiety is a 5- or 6-membered ring heteroaromatic, preferably 3-pyridinyl and 5-pyrimidinyl moieties, and the alkyl group is typically a C\n1-4 \nalkyl. The substituent at the 3-position of the 1-azabicycloalkane is a carbonyl-containing functional group, such as an amide, carbamate, urea, thioamide, thiocarbamate, thiourea or similar functionality.\n\n\nThe compounds are beneficial in therapeutic applications requiring a selective interaction at certain nAChR subtypes. That is, the compounds modulate the activity of certain nAChR subtypes, particularly the α7 nAChR subtype, and do not have appreciable activity toward muscarinic receptors. The compounds can be administered in amounts sufficient to affect the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS) without significantly affecting those receptor subtypes that have the potential to induce undesirable side effects (e.g., without appreciable activity at ganglionic and skeletal muscle nAChR sites and at muscarinic receptors). The compounds are therefore useful towards modulating release of ligands involved in neurotransmission, without appreciable side effects.\n\n\nThe compounds can be used as therapeutic agents to treat and/or prevent disorders characterized by an alteration in normal neurotransmitter release. Examples of such disorders include certain CNS conditions and disorders. The compounds can provide neuroprotection, treat patients susceptible to convulsions, treat depression, autism, and certain neuroendocrine disorders, and help manage stroke patients. The compounds also are useful in treating hypertension, type II diabetes and neoplasia and effecting weight loss. As the compounds are selective for the α7 nAChR subtype, they can be used to treat certain conditions or disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, cognitive disorders, and neuropathic pain), prevent tissue damage, and hasten healing (i.e., provide neuroprotection and control of angiogenesis).\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions provide therapeutic benefit to individuals suffering from such conditions or disorders and exhibiting clinical manifestations of such conditions or disorders. The compounds, administered with the pharmaceutical compositions, can be employed in effective amounts to (i) exhibit nicotinic pharmacology and affect relevant nAChR sites (e.g., act as a pharmacological agonists at nicotinic receptors), and (ii) modulate neurotransmitter secretion, and hence prevent and suppress the symptoms associated with those diseases. In addition, the compounds have the potential to (i) increase the number of nAChRs of the brain of the patient, (ii) exhibit neuroprotective effects and (iii) when employed in effective amounts, not cause appreciable adverse side effects (e.g., significant increases in blood pressure and heart rate, significant negative effects upon the gastro-intestinal tract, and significant effects upon skeletal muscle). The pharmaceutical compositions are believed to be safe and effective with regards to prevention and treatment of various conditions or disorders.\n\n\nThe foregoing and other aspects of the present invention are explained in detail in the detailed description and examples set forth below.\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe compounds described herein have structures that are represented by Formulas 1 and 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Formulas 1 and 2, m and n individually can have a value of 1 or 2, and p can have a value of 1, 2, 3 or 4. In the Formulas, X is either oxygen or nitrogen (i.e., NR′), Y is either oxygen or sulfur, and Z is either nitrogen (i.e., NR′), a covalent bond or a linker species, A.

Ar is an aryl group, either carbocyclic or heterocyclic, either monocyclic or fused polycyclic, unsubstituted or substituted; and Cy is a 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic ring, unsubstituted or substituted. The wavy lines indicate that both relative and absolute stereochemistry at those sites are variable (e.g., cis or trans, R or S). The invention further includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds have one or more asymmetric carbons and can therefore exist in the form of racemic mixtures, enantiomers and diastereomers.

The salts may be in some cases hydrates or ethanol solvates. Representative salts are provided as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,597,919 to Dull et al., 5,616,716 to Dull et al. and 5,663,356 to Ruecroft et al.\n\n\nAs used herein, neurotransmitters whose release is modulated (i.e., increased or decreased, depending on whether the compounds function as agonists, partial agonists or antagonists) by the compounds described herein include, but are not limited to, acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and glutamate, and the compounds described herein function as modulators of one or more nicotinic receptors.\n\n\nAs used herein, an “agonist” is a substance that stimulates its binding partner, typically a receptor. Stimulation is defined in the context of the particular assay, or may be apparent in the literature from a discussion herein that makes a comparison to a factor or substance that is accepted as an “agonist” or an “antagonist” of the particular binding partner under substantially similar circumstances as appreciated by those of skill in the art. Stimulation may be defined with respect to an increase in a particular effect or function that is induced by interaction of the agonist or partial agonist with a binding partner and can include allosteric effects.\n\n\nAs used herein, an “antagonist” is a substance that inhibits its binding partner, typically a receptor. Inhibition is defined in the context of the particular assay, or may be apparent in the literature from a discussion herein that makes a comparison to a factor or substance that is accepted as an “agonist” or an “antagonist” of the particular binding partner under substantially similar circumstances as appreciated by those of skill in the art. Inhibition may be defined with respect to an decrease in a particular effect or function that is induced by interaction of the antagonist with a binding partner, and can include allosteric effects.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “partial agonist” is a substance that provides a level of stimulation to its binding partner that is intermediate between that of a full or complete antagonist and an agonist defined by any accepted standard for agonist activity. It will be recognized that stimulation, and hence, inhibition is defined intrinsically for any substance or category of substances to be defined as agonists, antagonists, or partial agonists. As used herein, “intrinsic activity”, or “efficacy,” relates to some measure of biological effectiveness of the binding partner complex. With regard to receptor pharmacology, the context in which intrinsic activity or efficacy should be defined will depend on the context of the binding partner (e.g., receptor/ligand) complex and the consideration of an activity relevant to a particular biological outcome. For example, in some circumstances, intrinsic activity may vary depending on the particular second messenger system involved.

Compounds resulting from the substitution of 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, in any of the forgoing representative compounds, with either 1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, 1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane or 1-azabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane are also representative compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nMore specifically, the compounds of Formula 2 include compounds of the following general formulas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn each of these compounds, individual isomers thereof, mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, enantiomers, diastereomers and tautomers thereof, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nI. Methods of Preparing the Compounds\n\n\nPreparation of 2-(Arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes\n\n\nCompounds of Formulas 1 and 2 are 3-substituted 2-(arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes. While the manner in which compounds of the present invention can be prepared can vary, they are conveniently prepared using intermediates (ketones and alcohols) generated during the synthesis of 2-(arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes, which is now described. While other synthetic strategies will be apparent to those of skill in the art, 2-(arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes can be made by reduction of aldol condensation products formed from aldehydes and certain azabicyclic ketones. Thus, when 3-quinuclidinone hydrochloride is reacted with pyridine-3-carboxaldehyde (available from Aldrich Chemical Company), in the presence of methanolic potassium hydroxide, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one results. Stepwise reduction of the conjugated enone functionality can be accomplished through several different sequences, to provide 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. For instance, catalytic hydrogenation (palladium catalyst) of the enone produces the saturated ketone, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one, an intermediate in the synthesis of compounds of the present invention (see section entitled “Substituted-2-(Arylallyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes”). Reduction of the ketone to the alcohol can be accomplished, for example, using sodium borohydride, aluminum isopropoxide, or other reagents known in the art of chemical synthesis for carrying out similar reductions. The alcohol, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol, is a mixture of cis and trans diastereomers (with the former predominating) and is also an intermediate in the synthesis of compounds of the present invention (see section entitled “Substituted-2-(Arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes”). The choice of reducing agent affects the cis/trans ratio. The alcohol can then be converted to the corresponding chloride, 3-chloro-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, using thionyl chloride or similar reagents. The chloride can then be reduced to 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, for example, using Raney nickel. The chloro intermediate can also be converted into the alkene, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene, which can then be reduced to the alkane by catalytic hydrogenation. 1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene can be used for the dehydrohalogenation reaction, according to the method of Wolkoff, \nJ. Org. Chem. \n47: 1944 (1982). Alternatively, the 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one can then be converted into 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane by first reducing the ketone functionality using sodium borohydride. The resulting unsaturated alcohol, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol, is treated with thionyl chloride (to make the chloro compound), followed by Raney nickel (to reductively remove the chloro moiety), and then hydrogenated, for example, over a palladium catalyst (to reduce the double bond) to give the alkane. It is noteworthy that, when this latter route is employed, allylic rearrangements are observed. For instance, the material resulting from Raney nickel reduction of the chloro compound is a mixture of exocyclic and endocyclic alkenes, with the latter predominating. This route provides access to both 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene.\n\n\nIn an alternative approach, 2-(arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes can be made by reacting aryl-containing organometallic compounds with azabicyclic carbonyl compounds and subsequently reducing the resulting alcohol, using the methods described above, to the alkane. For example, 2-((3-pyridinyl)hydroxymethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane can be produced by reacting 3-pyridinyllithium with quinuclidine-2-carboxaldehyde. Reaction of the alcohol with thionyl chloride to produce the corresponding chloride, and subsequent reduction with Raney nickel, will give 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Synthesis of the requisite quinuclidine-2-carboxaldehyde is described by Ricciardi and Doukas, \nHeterocycles \n24: 971 (1986), and the 3-pyridinyllithium can be generated from 3-bromopyridine by treatment with n-butyllithium in ether or toluene at low temperature (Cai et al., \nTetrahedron Lett. \n43: 4285 (2002)).\n\n\nThe manner in which 2-((4-, 5-, and 6-substituted-3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes can be synthesized can vary. For example, 5-bromopyridine-3-carboxaldehyde and 3-quinuclidinone hydrochloride (commercially available from Aldrich) can be reacted together in the presence of methanolic potassium hydroxide as described in Neilsen and Houlihan, \nOrg. React. \n16: 1 (1968). The aldol condensation product, 2-((5-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one, can then be treated with sodium borohydride to yield the alcohol, 2-((5-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol, as a crystalline solid. This intermediate is reacted with neat thionyl chloride at room temperature to give 3-chloro-2-((5-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane dihydrochloride as a pure crystalline solid. Reductive removal of the chlorine can be accomplished using lithium trimethoxyaluminum hydride and copper iodide as described by Masamune et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n95: 6452 (1973) to give the desired product, 2-((5-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, as a crystalline solid. This methylene intermediate can then be converted to the desired product, 2-((5-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, by hydrogenation in the presence of palladium catalyst. The isomeric compounds, 2-((4-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and 2-((6-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane can be prepared in a similar manner by replacing 5-bromopyridine-3-carboxaldehyde with 4-bromopyridine-3-carboxaldehyde or 6-bromopyridine-3-carboxaldehyde, respectively, in the synthetic approach given above.\n\n\nThe required aldehyde, 5-bromopyridine-3-carboxaldehyde, can be prepared from 5-bromonicotinic acid (commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company and Lancaster Synthesis, Inc.). The 5-bromonicotinic acid can be treated with ethyl chloroformate to form a mixed anhydride, which can then be reduced, for example, with lithium aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at −78° C., to afford 5-bromo-3-(hydroxymethyl)pyridine, as reported by Ashimori et al., \nChem. Pharm. Bull. \n38(9): 2446 (1990). Alternatively, the 5-bromonicotinic acid can be esterified, for example, in the presence of sulfuric acid and ethanol and the intermediate ethyl ester reduced with an excess of sodium borohydride to yield 5-bromo-3-(hydroxymethyl)pyridine, according to the techniques reported in Nutaitis et al., \nOrg. Prep. and Proc. Int. \n24: 143 (1992). The resulting 5-bromo-3-(hydroxymethyl)pyridine can then be converted to 5-bromo-3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde by Swern oxidation using oxalyl chloride and dimethylsulfoxide, according to the methods of Stocks et al., \nTetrahedron Lett. \n36(36): 6555 (1995) and Mancuso et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n44(23): 4148 (1979). The aldehyde, 4-bromopyridine-3-carboxaldehyde can be synthesized according to methodology described in PCT WO 94/29893 by Chin et al. or by methodology described by Ojea et al., \nSynlett. \n6: 622 (1995). 6-Bromopyridine-3-carboxaldehyde can be prepared according to procedures described in Windschief and Voegtle, \nSynthesis \n1: 87 (1994) or German Patent No. 93/4320432 to Fey et al.\n\n\nThe methods described above are applicable to the preparation of a variety of 2-(arylmethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes, 2-(arylmethylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes and 2-(arylmethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-enes by variation of the aldehyde component of the aldol condensation using no more than routine experimentation. Both substituted and unsubstituted, carbocyclic and heterocyclic aromatic aldehydes can be used.\n\n\nThose skilled in the art of organic synthesis will appreciate that the reactivity of substituents borne by the aldehyde must be evaluated carefully, as some substituents may be transformed by the reaction conditions employed. Examples of groups that are potentially reactive under the reaction conditions are —OH, —SH, —NH\n2 \nand —CO\n2\nH. Suitable protecting groups or synthons for such substituents can be used, as are well known to those of skill in the art, for substituents that might otherwise be transformed during the aldol condensation or subsequent reaction steps. These “protecting” groups can be choosen, introduced and cleaved in accordance to methods described by Greene and Wuts, \nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis \n2\nnd \ned., Wiley-Interscience Pub. (1991). Examples of suitable synthons are described, for example, in Hase, \nUmpoled Svnthons: A Survey of Sources and Uses in Synthesis\n, Wiley, Europe (1987). The contents of these publications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nVariation in the Length of the Linker\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention can contain more than one carbon in the linker between the heteroaromatic ring and azabicyclic ring functionalities. The manner in which such compounds as 2-(2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 2-(3-(3-pyridinyl)propyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, and 2-(4-(3-pyridinyl)butyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane can be prepared can vary. For example, 2-(2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane can be prepared by different methods. In one approach, 3-pyridineacetaldehyde (also known as 2-(3-pyridinyl)ethanal) can be condensed with 3-quinuclidinone hydrochloride (commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company) in a directed aldol reaction using a base such as potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide in methanol or sodium ethoxide in ethanol. Directed aldol condensations between an aldehyde and a ketone with accompanying reaction modifications, including procedures utilizing various enol ethers, are described in Smith and March, \nAdvanced Organic Chemistry, Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, \n5\nth \ned., Wiley-Interscience Pubs., pp. 1220-1221 (2001). Depending on reaction conditions, condensation products may or may not spontaneously dehydrate to give enones. Thus, it may be necessary to treat the intermediate condensation products, such as 2-(1-hydroxy-2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one, under any of various dehydration protocols, known to those skilled in the art, to generate, in this case, 24243-pyridinyl)ethylidene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one. The carbon-carbon double bond of this unsaturated ketone can be reduced by hydrogenation to give the ketone, 2-(2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one, which can be further reduced under Wolff-Kishner conditions to yield 2-(2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Methods similar to those described by Yanina et al., \nKhim\n.-\nFarm. Zh. \n21(7): 808 (1987) can be used for the latter reductions. Alternatively, the ketone can be reduced to the alcohol using sodium borohydride and the alcohol subsequently reduced to the alkane by conversion to the chloro intermediate (using thionyl chloride), followed by Raney nickel reduction. Replacement of 2-(3-pyridinyl)ethanal in the above synthetic approach with 3-(3-pyridinyl)propanal leads to 2-(3-(3-pyridinyl)propyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and the corresponding synthetic intermediates. Replacement of 2-(3-pyridinyl)ethanal in the above synthetic approach with 4-(3-pyridinyl)butanal leads to 2-(4-(3-pyridinyl)butyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and the corresponding synthetic intermediates. In all cases, the saturated ketone and alcohol intermediates provide a synthetic approach to compounds of the present invention (see section entitled “Substituted 2-(Arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes”).\n\n\nThe requisite aldehydes for the above aldol condensations can be prepared by various methods. In one approach, 3-pyridineacetaldehyde (also known as 2-(3-pyridinyl)ethanal) can be prepared from 3-pyridinylacetic acid hydrochloride (commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company and Lancaster Synthesis, Inc.) through the intermediacy of the ester. Thus, treatment with trimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine generates the trimethylsilyl ester, which can then be reduced with diisobutylaluminum hydride according to the method of Chandrasekhar et al., \nTet. Lett. \n39: 909 (1998). Alternatively, 3-pyridineacetaldehyde can be prepared from 3-(3-pyridinyl)acrylic acid (commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company and Lancaster Synthesis, Inc.) using the method of Hey et al., \nJ. Chem. Soc\n. Part II: 1678 (1950). In this method, 3-(3-pyridinyl)acrylic acid can be converted to its acid chloride by treatment with thionyl chloride. Subsequent treatment of the acid chloride with ammonia, according to the method of Panizza, \nHelv. Chim. Acta \n24: 24E (1941), yields β-(3-pyridinyl)acrylamide. Hofmann rearrangement of the latter amide by treatment with sodium hypochlorite affords methyl 2-(3-pyridinyl)vinylcarbamate, which can be hydrolyzed with refluxing 3 M sulfuric acid in ethanol to give 3-pyridineacetaldehyde, which can be isolated as its 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone sulfate.\n\n\nThe aldehyde, 3-(3-pyridinyl)propanal, which can be used to prepare 2-(3-(3-pyridinyl)propyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and related compounds, can be prepared from 3-(3-pyridinyl)propanol (commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company and Lancaster Synthesis, Inc.). Oxidation of the latter alcohol, for example, with lead acetate in pyridine, according to the method of Ratcliffe et al., \nJ. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. \n1 8: 1767 (1985), affords 3-(3-pyridinyl)propanal. Alternatively, 3-(3-pyridinyl)propanal can be prepared by Swern oxidization of 3-(3-pyridinyl)propanol using oxalyl chloride in dimethyl sulfoxide and dichloromethane according to the methods of Stocks et al., \nTet. Lett. \n36(36): 6555 (1995) and Mancuso et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n44(23): 4148 (1979).\n\n\nThe aldehyde, 4-(3-pyridinyl)butanal, required for the preparation of 2-(4-(3-pyridinyl)butyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and related compounds can be prepared from 3-(3-pyridinyl)propanol (commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company and Lancaster Synthesis, Inc.) by a homologative process according to the method of Solladie et al., \nTetrahedron: Asymmetry \n8(5): 801 (1997). Treatment of 3-(3-pyridinyl)propanol with tribromoimidazole and triphenylphosphine yields 1-bromo-3-(3-pyridinyl)propane, which can be condensed with the lithium salt of 1,3-dithiane. Hydrolysis of the dithianyl group of the resulting compound with aqueous mercuric chloride and mercuric oxide affords 4-(3-pyridinyl)butanal.\n\n\nIn yet another approach to the synthesis of 2-(2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 3-picoline can be converted into its lithio derivative, 3-(lithiomethyl)pyridine, as described by Fraser et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n50: 3232 (1985), and reacted with quinuclidine-2-carboxaldehyde. The resulting alcohol, 2-(1-hydroxy-2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, can then be converted to 2-(2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane by one of the sequences previously described (i.e., dehydration, catalytic hydrogenation; conversion to the chloride, dehydrohalogenation, catalytic hydrogenation; conversion to the chloride, Raney nickel reduction). The synthesis of quinuclidine-2-carboxaldehyde is described by Ricciardi and Doukas, \nHeterocycles \n24: 971 (1986).\n\n\nVariation in the Azabicycle\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention include those in which the azabicycle is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. The manner in which 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes can be synthesized can vary. In one approach, pyridine-3-carboxaldehyde can be reacted with 1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one in an aldol condensation. The aldol condensation product, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one, can then be converted, using reaction sequences described previously for the 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane case, into 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. A variety of unsubstituted or substituted, carbocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic aldehydes can be employed in this sequence. The requisite 1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one can be synthesized, for example, according to the methods of Wadsworth et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,217,975 and Street et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n33: 2690 (1990).\n\n\nThe present invention includes compounds in which the azabicycle is 1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane, such as 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane. An approach similar to that described for the 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane case can be used to synthesize 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane. Thus, the aldol condensation of pyridine-3-carboxaldehyde and 1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one (see Sternbach et al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n74: 2215 (1952)) will generate isomeric products, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one and 4-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one. These can then be chromatographically separated and the 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one treated as described before to produce 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane. A variety of unsubstituted or substituted, carbocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic aldehydes can be employed in this sequence. The requisite 1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one can be synthesized, for example, according to the method of Thill and Aaron, \nJ. Org. Chem. \n33: 4376 (1969). In all cases, the saturated ketone and alcohol intermediates provide a synthetic approach to compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nSubstituted 2-(Arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes\n\n\nIt will be immediately recognized, by those skilled in the art, that the intermediates generated during the described syntheses of 2-(arylalkyl)-1-azabicycles present many opportunities for synthesizing substituted derivatives. For instance, conjugated enones, such as 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one, are known to undergo 1,4-addition reactions when exposed to organolithium and organomagnesium reagents in the presence of cuprous salts. Such chemistry is reviewed by Posner, \nOrg. React. \n19: 1 (1972) and House, \nAcc. Chem. Res. \n9: 59 (1976). In some cases conjugate 1,4-addition is observed even in the absence of cuprous salts. Thus, treatment of 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one with phenylmagnesium bromide in ether at −10° C. gives 2-(1-phenyl-1-(3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-3-one as the predominant product. This ketone can then be treated with sodium borohydride to yield the alcohol, 2-(1-phenyl-1-(3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol. This alcohol can then be reacted with neat thionyl chloride at room temperature to give 3-chloro-2-(1-phenyl-1-(3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane as a crystalline solid. The chlorine can be removed by hydrogenation in the presence of Raney nickel, as described by de Koning, \nOrg. Prep. Proced. Int. \n7: 31 (1975), to give 2-(1-phenyl-1-(3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Using variations on this approach, a number of alkyl and aryl substituents can be installed on the linker moiety between the heteroaromatic (e.g., pyridine) and azabicyclic (e.g., quinuclidine) rings.\n\n\nThe saturated ketone intermediates, such as 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one, also present opportunities for derivatization. One example is the reaction with phosphorus ylids (Wittig and Horner-Emmons reagents) to give alkenes. These alkenes can subsequently be reduced to alkanes by catalytic hydrogenation, providing a means of producing 2-((heteroaryl)alkyl)-1-azabicycles with alkyl and substituted alkyl substituents at the 3-position of the azabicycle. Thus, by way of example, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one reacts with methylenetriphenylphosphorane to give 3-methylene-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Hydrogenation of this alkene, for example, over palladium on carbon catalyst, yields 3-methyl-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane as predominantly the cis diastereomer.\n\n\nAnother illustration of derivatization of saturated ketone intermediates is the reductive amination to give amines. Thus, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one reacts with ammonium formate, zinc chloride and sodium cyanoborohydride to give 3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane as predominantly the cis diastereomer. Likewise, reaction of 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one with methylamine and sodium cyanoborohydride provides 3-(methylamino)-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. These amine derivatives can be used as a template for library formation by reacting them with a variety of acylating agents (e.g., acid chlorides, acid anhydrides, active esters, and carboxylic acids in the presence of coupling reagents) and isocyanates to produce 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes with amide and urea substituents in the 3-position of the 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, both of which classes are compounds of the present invention. Commercially unavailable isocyanates can be prepared in situ from corresponding amines and triphosgene in the presence of triethylamine. Such derivatives can be produced as single enantiomers, using the single enantiomers of 3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and 3-(methylamino)-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane as starting materials. For instance, the (2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)-3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes can be produced by resolution of the cis 3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, for example, using diastereomeric amides. Thus, when the cis amine is reacted with a chiral acid such as (S)—N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)proline using a suitable coupling agent such as diphenylchlorophosphate, a pair of diastereomeric amides, separable by reverse phase chromatography, is produced. The separated proline amides can then be deprotected, for example, by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid (to remove the tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group) and then the proline can be cleaved from the desired amine, for example, using Edman degradation conditions (i.e., phenylisothiocyanate, followed by trifluoroacetic acid).\n\n\nAlternatively, racemic reductive amination products such as 3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane can be separated into their enantiomers by fractional crystallization of the di-O-p-toluoyltartaric acid salts. Both the D (S,S) and L (R,R) isomers of this acid are commercially available (Aldrich Chemical Company). Thus, combination of the racemic cis 3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane with 0.5 molar equivalents of either enantiomer of di-O-p-toluoyltartaric acid yields a diastereomeric salt mixture, from which a single diastereomer precipitates from methanol solution.\n\n\nThe saturated alcohol intermediates, such as 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol, can also serve as templates for compound libraries. For instance, ethers can be generated from these alcohols, for example, using either Mitsunobu or Williamson conditions. Thus, by way of example, when 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol is reacted with phenol via Mitsunobu coupling with diethylazidocarboxylate and triphenylphosphine (Guthrie et al., \nJ. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans \n145: 2328 (1981)), 3-phenoxy-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane results. Similarly, when 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol is treated with sodium hydride and methyl iodide, the unsaturated ether, 3-methoxy-2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, is formed. This gives the saturated ether, 3-methoxy-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (predominantly cis), upon catalytic hydrogenation.\n\n\nThe saturated alcohol intermediates can also be reacted with acylating agents (e.g., acid chlorides and anhydrides) and isocyanates to produce esters and carbamates, respectively. Thus, by way of example, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol reacts with phenylisocyanate to yield 3-(N-phenylcarbamoyloxy)-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Such carbamate compounds are compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nSuch derivatives can be produced as single enantiomers, using the single enantiomers of 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol as starting materials. For instance, the (2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ols can be produced by resolution of the cis 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol, using diastereomeric esters. Thus, when the cis alcohol is reacted with (S)-2-methoxy-2-phenylacetic acid and N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, a pair of diastereomeric esters, separable by reverse phase chromatography, is produced. The separated esters can then be hydrolyzed to the enantiomerically pure alcohols, for example, using potassium hydroxide in methanol. Alternatively (1S)-(−)-camphanic acid chloride can be used to produce diastereomeric camphanate esters of cis 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol. The esters are then fractionally crystallized, using the procedure described by Swaim, et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n38: 4793 (1995).\n\n\nA number of compounds possessing substituents at the 5-position of the pyridine ring can be prepared from 2-((5-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, the synthesis of which has already been described. For example, the 5-amino-substituted compound can be prepared from the corresponding 5-bromo compound, using ammonia in the presence of a copper catalyst according to the general method of Zwart et al., \nRecueil Trav. Chim. Pays\n-\nBas \n74: 1062 (1955). 5-Alkylamino-substituted compounds can be prepared in a similar manner. 5-Alkoxy-substituted analogs can be prepared from the corresponding 5-bromo compounds by heating with a sodium alkoxide in N,N-dimethylformamide or by use of a copper catalyst according to the general techniques described by Comins et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n55: 69 (1990) and den Hertog et al., \nRecueil Trav. Chim. Pays\n-\nBas \n74: 1171 (1955). 5-Ethynyl-substituted compounds can be prepared from the appropriate 5-bromo compounds by palladium-catalyzed coupling using 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol, followed by base (sodium hydride) catalyzed deprotection, according to the general techniques described by Cosford et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n39: 3235 (1996). The 5-ethynyl analogs can be converted into the corresponding 5-ethenyl, and subsequently to the corresponding 5-ethyl analogs by successive catalytic hydrogenation reactions. The 5-phenyl analogs can be prepared from the 5-bromo compounds by Suzuki coupling with phenylboronic acid. Substituted phenylboronic acids can also be used. The 5-azido-substituted analogs can be prepared from the corresponding 5-bromo compounds by reaction with sodium azide in N,N-dimethylformamide. 5-Alkylthio-substituted analogs can be prepared from the corresponding 5-bromo compound by reaction with an appropriate alkylmercaptan in the presence of sodium, using techniques known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis.\n\n\nA number of 5-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds can be synthesized from the corresponding 5-amino compounds via the 5-diazonium salt intermediates. Among the other 5-substituted analogs that can be produced from 5-diazonium salt intermediates are: 5-hydroxy analogs, 5-fluoro analogs, 5-chloro analogs, 5-bromo analogs, 5-iodo analogs, 5-cyano analogs, and 5-mercapto analogs. These compounds can be synthesized using the general techniques set forth in Zwart et al., \nRecueil Trav. Chim. Pays\n-\nBas \n74: 1062 (1955). For example, 5-hydroxy-substituted analogs can be prepared from the reaction of the corresponding 5-diazonium salt intermediates with water. 5-Fluoro-substituted analogs can be prepared from the reaction of the 5-diazonium salt intermediates with fluoroboric acid. 5-Chloro-substituted analogs can be prepared from the reaction of the 5-amino compounds with sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid in the presence of copper chloride. 5-Cyano-substituted analogs can be prepared from the reaction of the corresponding 5-diazonium salt intermediates with potassium copper cyanide. 5-Amino-substituted analogs can also be converted to the corresponding 5-nitro analogs by reaction with fuming sulfuric acid and peroxide, according to the general techniques described in Morisawa, \nJ. Med. Chem. \n20: 129 (1977) for converting an aminopyridine to a nitropyridine. Appropriate 5-diazonium salt intermediates can also be used for the synthesis of mercapto-substituted analogs using the general techniques described in Hoffman et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n36: 953 (1993). The 5-mercapto-substituted analogs can in turn be converted to the 5-alkylthio-substituted analogs by reaction with sodium hydride and an appropriate alkyl bromide. 5-Acylamido analogs of the aforementioned compounds can be prepared by reaction of the corresponding 5-amino compounds with an appropriate acid anhydride or acid chloride, using techniques known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis.\n\n\n5-Hydroxy-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds can be used to prepare corresponding 5-alkanoyloxy-substituted compounds by reaction with the appropriate acid, acid chloride, or acid anhydride. Likewise, the 5-hydroxy compounds are precursors of both the 5-aryloxy and 5-heteroaryloxy analogs via nucleophilic aromatic substitution at electron deficient aromatic rings (e.g., 4-fluorobenzonitrile and 2,4-dichloropyrimidine). Such chemistry is well known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Ether derivatives can also be prepared from the 5-hydroxy compounds by alkylation with alkyl halides and a suitable base or via Mitsunobu chemistry, in which a trialkyl- or triarylphosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate are typically used. See Hughes, \nOrg. React\n. (\nN.Y\n.) 42: 335 (1992) and Hughes, \nOrg. Prep. Proced. Int. \n28: 127 (1996) for typical Mitsunobu conditions.\n\n\n5-Cyano-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds can be hydrolyzed to afford the corresponding 5-carboxamido-substituted compounds. Further hydrolysis results in formation of the corresponding 5-carboxylic acid-substituted analogs. Reduction of the 5-cyano-substituted analogs with lithium aluminum hydride yields the corresponding 5-aminomethyl analogs. 5-Acyl-substituted analogs can be prepared from corresponding 5-carboxylic acid-substituted analogs by reaction with an appropriate alkyllithium reagent using techniques known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis.\n\n\n5-Carboxylic acid-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds can be converted to the corresponding esters by reaction with an appropriate alcohol and acid catalyst. Compounds with an ester group at the 5-pyridinyl position can be reduced, for example, with sodium borohydride or lithium aluminum hydride to produce the corresponding 5-hydroxymethyl-substituted analogs. These analogs in turn can be converted to compounds bearing an alkoxymethyl moiety at the 5-pyridinyl position by reaction, for example, with sodium hydride and an appropriate alkyl halide, using conventional techniques. Alternatively, the 5-hydroxymethyl-substituted analogs can be reacted with tosyl chloride to provide the corresponding 5-tosyloxymethyl analogs. The 5-carboxylic acid-substituted analogs can also be converted to the corresponding 5-alkylaminoacyl analogs by sequential treatment with thionyl chloride and an appropriate alkylamine. Certain of these amides are known to readily undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution to produce ketones. Thus, the so-called Weinreb amides (N-methoxy-N-methylamides) react with aryllithium reagents to produce the corresponding diaryl ketones. For example, see Selnick et al., \nTet. Lett. \n34: 2043 (1993).\n\n\n5-Tosyloxymethyl-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds can be converted to the corresponding 5-methyl-substituted compounds by reduction with lithium aluminum hydride. 5-Tosyloxymethyl-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds can also be used to produce 5-alkyl-substituted compounds via reaction with an alkyl lithium salt. 5-Hydroxy-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds can be used to prepare 5-N-alkylcarbamoyloxy-substituted compounds by reaction with N-alkylisocyanates. 5-Amino-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds can be used to prepare 5-N-alkoxycarboxamido-substituted compounds by reaction with alkyl chloroformate esters, using techniques known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis.\n\n\nAnalogous chemistries to those described hereinbefore, for the preparation of the 5-substituted analogs of compounds of the present invention, can be employed for the synthesis of 2-, 4-, and 6-substituted analogs. Starting materials for these transformations include the aforementioned 2-((4- and 6-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes, as well as the 2-((2-, 4-, and 6-amino-3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes, which are accessible from 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane via the Chichibabin reaction (Lahti et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n42: 2227 (1999).\n\n\nThe compounds can be isolated and purified using methods well known to those of skill in the art, including, for example, crystallization, chromatography and/or extraction.\n\n\nThe compounds of Formulas 1 and 2 can be obtained in optically pure form by separating their racemates in accordance with the customary methods or by using optically pure starting materials.\n\n\nThe compounds of Formulas 1 and 2 can optionally be converted into addition salts with a mineral or organic acid by the action of such an acid in an appropriate solvent, for example, an organic solvent such as an alcohol, a ketone, an ether or a chlorinated solvent. These salts likewise form part of the invention.\n\n\nRepresentative pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, benzenesulphonate, bromide, chloride, citrate, ethanesulphonate, fumarate, gluconate, iodate, maleate, isethionate, methanesulphonate, methylenebis((β-oxynaphthoate), nitrate, oxalate, palmoate, phosphate, salicylate, succinate, sulphate, tartrate, theophyllinacetate, p-toluenesulphonate, hemigalactarate and galactarate salts.\n\n\nImaging Agents\n\n\nCertain compounds of the present invention (e.g., the amide derivatives of 3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) can be synthesized in such a manner as to incorporate a radionuclide useful in diagnostic imaging. Of particular interest are those compounds that include radioactive isotopic moieties such as \n11\nC, \n18\nF, \n76\nBr, \n123\nI, \n125\nI, and the like. The compounds can be radiolabeled at any of a variety of positions. For example, a radionuclide of the halogen series may be used within an alkyl halide or aryl halide moiety or functionality; while a radionuclide such as \n11\nC may be used with an alkyl (e.g., methyl) moiety or functionality.\n\n\nFor instance, commercially available p-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Aldrich) is converted, by treatment with iodomethane in methanol, into p-(trimethylammonium)benzoate, as described by Willstaetter and Kahn, \nChem. Ber. \n37: 406 (1904). The displacement of the trimethylammonium group by fluoride has been reported, in similar compounds, by several researchers (see, for instance, Mach et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n36: 3707 (1993) and Jalalian et al., \nJ. Labelled Compd. Radiopharm. \n43: 545 (2000)). These nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions are typically carried out in dimethylsulfoxide (with or without water cosolvent), using KF or CsF as the source of fluoride ion (when KF is used, often Kryptofix®222 is added). When \n18\nF is used in such a displacement, p-\n18\nfluorobenzoic acid results. This carboxylic acid can be rapidly coupled to 3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), using any of a variety of techniques known to those skilled in the art (some of which are described previously), to generate N-(2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)-4-\n18\nfluorobenzamide, which can be used to specifically image α7 nAChRs.\n\n\nThose compounds that include an amide or urea functionality (i.e., X and/or Z=NR′, R′=H) can be readily radiolabeled by alkylating the amide or urea group with a radiolabeled haloalkane in the presence of a base (i.e., to form substituted compounds where R′ is a radiolabeled lower alkyl, cycloalkyl or arylalkyl moiety). One example of such a radiolabeled haloalkane is \n11\nC-labeled methyl iodide. Methods similar to those described by A. G. Horti et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n41: 4199-4206 (1998) can be used. The resulting N-[\n11\nC]methyl-containing compounds can be purified by semi-preparative or preparative HPLC and briefly isolated for reconstitution. The \n11\nC-labeled methyl iodide can be prepared according to the general method described by B. Långström et al. \nJ. Nucl. Med. \n28(6):1037-1040 (1987). Thus, nitrogen gas is irradiated with 10 MeV protons producing \n11\nC-carbon dioxide. The \n11\nC-carbon dioxide is trapped using 4 Å molecular sieves, which are subsequently stored in a lead shield. The \n11\nC-carbon dioxide is liberated from the 4 Å molecular sieves by heating to ˜250° C. The \n11\nC-carbon dioxide is then carried in a stream of nitrogen and trapped in a vessel containing lithium aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran. The tetrahydrofuran is removed by heating and a nitrogen flow, and the lithium aluminum hydride complex is then hydrolyzed by treatment with hydriodic acid, affording \n11\nC-labeled methyl iodide. The \n11\nC-labeled methyl iodide can be transferred by carrier gas to the reaction vessel containing the material to be methylated. The required amide- and urea-containing precursor compounds are described in detail above, and the resulting radiolabeled compounds can also be used to specifically image ea nAChRs.\n\n\nII. Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nThe compounds described herein can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions and used to prevent a condition or disorder in a subject susceptible to such a condition or disorder, and/or to treat a subject suffering from the condition or disorder. The pharmaceutical compositions described herein include one or more compounds of Formulas 1 and 2 and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Chiral compounds can be employed as racemic mixtures or as pure enantiomers.\n\n\nThe manner in which the compounds are administered can vary. The compositions are preferably administered orally (e.g., in liquid form within a solvent such as an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or within a solid carrier). Preferred compositions for oral administration include pills, tablets, capsules, caplets, syrups, and solutions, including hard gelatin capsules and time-release capsules. Compositions can be formulated in unit dose form, or in multiple or subunit doses. Preferred compositions are in liquid or semisolid form. Compositions including a liquid pharmaceutically inert carrier such as water or other pharmaceutically compatible liquids or semisolids can be used. The use of such liquids and semisolids is well known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\nThe compositions can also be administered via injection, i.e., intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intraarterially, intrathecally; and intracerebroventricularly. Intravenous administration is the preferred method of injection. Suitable carriers for injection are well known to those of skill in the art and include 5% dextrose solutions, saline, and phosphate-buffered saline. The compounds can also be administered as an infusion or injection (e.g., as a suspension or as an emulsion in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or mixture of liquids).\n\n\nThe formulations can also be administered using other means, for example, rectal administration. Formulations useful for rectal administration, such as suppositories, are well known to those of skill in the art. The compounds can also be administered by inhalation (e.g., in the form of an aerosol either nasally or using delivery articles of the type set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,922,901 to Brooks et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety); topically (e.g., in lotion form); or transdermally (e.g., using a transdermal patch, using technology that is commercially available from Novartis and Alza Corporation). Although it is possible to administer the compounds in the form of a bulk active chemical, it is preferred to present each compound in the form of a pharmaceutical composition or formulation for efficient and effective administration.\n\n\nExemplary methods for administering such compounds will be apparent to the skilled artisan. The usefulness of these formulations can depend on the particular composition used and the particular subject receiving the treatment. These formulations can contain a liquid carrier that can be oily, aqueous, emulsified or contain certain solvents suitable to the mode of administration.\n\n\nThe compositions can be administered intermittently or at a gradual, continuous, constant or controlled rate to a warm-blooded animal (e.g., a mammal such as a mouse, rat, cat, rabbit, dog, pig, cow, or monkey), but advantageously are administered to a human being. In addition, the time of day and the number of times per day that the pharmaceutical formulation is administered can vary.\n\n\nPreferably, upon administration, the active ingredients interact with receptor sites within the body of the subject that affect the functioning of the CNS. More specifically, in treating a CNS disorder, preferable administration is designed to optimize the effect upon those relevant nicotinic acethylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes that have an effect upon the functioning of the CNS, while minimizing the effects upon muscle-type receptor subtypes. Other suitable methods for administering the compounds of the present invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,604,231 to Smith et al., the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nIn certain circumstances, the compounds described herein can be employed as part of a pharmaceutical composition with other compounds intended to prevent or treat a particular disorder. In addition to effective amounts of the compounds described herein, the pharmaceutical compositions can also include various other components as additives or adjuncts. Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable components or adjuncts which are employed in relevant circumstances include antioxidants, free-radical scavenging agents, peptides, growth factors, antibiotics, bacteriostatic agents, immunosuppressives, anticoagulants, buffering agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-pyretics, time-release binders, anesthetics, steroids, vitamins, minerals and corticosteroids. Such components can provide additional therapeutic benefit, act to affect the therapeutic action of the pharmaceutical composition, or act towards preventing any potential side effects that can be imposed as a result of administration of the pharmaceutical composition.\n\n\nThe appropriate dose of the compound is that amount effective to prevent occurrence of the symptoms of the disorder or to treat some symptoms of the disorder from which the patient suffers. By “effective amount”, “therapeutic amount” or “effective dose” is meant that amount sufficient to elicit the desired pharmacological or therapeutic effects, thus resulting in effective prevention or treatment of the disorder.\n\n\nWhen treating a CNS disorder, an effective amount of compound is an amount sufficient to pass across the blood-brain barrier of the subject, to bind to relevant receptor sites in the brain of the subject and to modulate the activity of relevant nAChR subtypes (e.g., provide neurotransmitter secretion, thus resulting in effective prevention or treatment of the disorder). Prevention of the disorder is manifested by delaying the onset of the symptoms of the disorder. Treatment of the disorder is manifested by a decrease in the symptoms associated with the disorder or an amelioration of the recurrence of the symptoms of the disorder. Preferably, the effective amount is sufficient to obtain the desired result, but insufficient to cause appreciable side effects.\n\n\nThe effective dose can vary, depending upon factors such as the condition of the patient, the severity of the symptoms of the disorder, and the manner in which the pharmaceutical composition is administered. For human patients, the effective dose of typical compounds generally requires administering the compound in an amount sufficient to modulate the activity of relevant nAChRs to effect neurotransmitter (e.g., dopamine) release, but the amount should be insufficient to induce effects on skeletal muscles and ganglia to any significant degree. The effective dose of compounds will of course differ from patient to patient, but in general includes amounts starting where CNS effects or other desired therapeutic effects occur but below the amount where muscular effects are observed.\n\n\nThe compounds, when employed in effective amounts in accordance with the method described herein, are selective to certain relevant nAChRs, but do not significantly activate receptors associated with undesirable side effects at concentrations at least greater than those required for eliciting the release of dopamine or other neurotransmitters. By this is meant that a particular dose of compound effective in preventing and/or treating a CNS disorder is essentially ineffective in eliciting activation of certain ganglionic-type nAChRs at concentration higher than 5 times, preferably higher than 100 times, and more preferably higher than 1,000 times than those required for modulation of neurotransmitter release. This selectivity of certain compounds described herein against those ganglionic-type receptors responsible for cardiovascular side effects is demonstrated by a lack of the ability of those compounds to activate nicotinic function of adrenal chromaffin tissue at concentrations greater than those required for activation of dopamine release.\n\n\nThe compounds described herein, when employed in effective amounts in accordance with the methods described herein, can provide some degree of prevention of the progression of CNS disorders, ameliorate symptoms of CNS disorders, and ameliorate to some degree of the recurrence of CNS disorders. The effective amounts of those compounds are typically below the threshold concentration required to elicit any appreciable side effects, for example those effects relating to skeletal muscle. The compounds can be administered in a therapeutic window in which certain CNS disorders are treated and certain side effects are avoided. Ideally, the effective dose of the compounds described herein is sufficient to provide the desired effects upon the CNS but is insufficient (i.e., is not at a high enough level) to provide undesirable side effects. Preferably, the compounds are administered at a dosage effective for treating the CNS disorders but less than ⅕, and often less than 1/10, the amount required to elicit certain side effects to any significant degree.\n\n\nMost preferably, effective doses are at very low concentrations, where maximal effects are observed to occur, with a minimum of side effects. Typically, the effective dose of such compounds generally requires administering the compound in an amount of less than 5 mg/kg of patient weight. Often, the compounds of the present invention are administered in an amount from less than about 1 mg/kg patent weight and usually less than about 100 μg/kg of patient weight, but frequently between about 10 μg to less than 100 μg/kg of patient weight. For compounds that do not induce effects on muscle-type nicotinic receptors at low concentrations, the effective dose is less than 5 mg/kg of patient weight; and often such compounds are administered in an amount from 50 μg to less than 5 mg/kg of patient weight. The foregoing effective doses typically represent that amount administered as a single dose, or as one or more doses administered over a 24-hour period.\n\n\nFor human patients, the effective dose of typical compounds generally requires administering the compound in an amount of at least about 1, often at least about 10, and frequently at least about 100 mg/24 hr/patient. For human patients, the effective dose of typical compounds requires administering the compound which generally does not exceed about 500, often does not exceed about 400, and frequently does not exceed about 300 mg/24 hr/patient. In addition, the compositions are advantageously administered at an effective dose such that the concentration of the compound within the plasma of the patient normally does not exceed 50 ng/mL, often does not exceed 30 ng/mL, and frequently does not exceed 10 ng/mL.\n\n\nIII. Methods of Using the Compounds and/or Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nThe compounds can be used to treat those types of conditions and disorders for which other types of nicotinic compounds have been proposed as therapeutics. See, for example, Williams et al., \nDrug News Perspec. \n7(4):205 (1994), Arneric et al., \nCNS Drug Rev. \n1(1):1 (1995), Arneric et al., \nExp. Opin. Invest.

Nos. 5,583,140 to Bencherif et al., 5,597,919 to Dull et al., and 5,604,231 to Smith et al., the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nMore particularly, the compounds can be used to treat those types of conditions and disorders for which nicotinic compounds with selectivity for the α7 nAChR subtype have been proposed as therapeutics. See, for example, Leonard et al., \nSchizophrenia Bulletin \n22(3): 431 (1996), Freedman et al., \nBiological Psychiatry \n38(1):22 (1995), Heeschen et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n100: 527 (2002), Utsugisawa et al., \nMolecular Brain Research \n106(1-2): 88 (2002), U.S. Patent Application 2002/0016371, Levin and Rezvani, \nCurrent Drug Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders \n1(4): 423 (2002)), O'Neill et al., \nCurrent Drug Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders \n1(4): 399 (2002, Jeyarasasingam et al., \nNeuroscience \n109(2): 275 (2002)), Xiao et al., \nProc.

Labelled Comp. Radiopharm. \n44: 785 (2001) and Macor et al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. \n11: 319 (2001) and references therein, the contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nThe compounds can also be used as adjunct therapy in combination with existing therapies in the management of the aforementioned types of diseases and disorders. In such situations, it is preferably to administer the active ingredients in a manner that minimizes effects upon nAChR subtypes such as those that are associated with muscle and ganglia. This can be accomplished by targeted drug delivery and/or by adjusting the dosage such that a desired effect is obtained without meeting the threshold dosage required to achieve significant side effects. The pharmaceutical compositions can be used to ameliorate any of the symptoms associated with those conditions, diseases and disorders. Representative classes of disorders that can be treated are discussed in detail below.\n\n\nTreatment of CNS Disorders\n\n\nExamples of conditions and disorders that can be treated include neurological disorders and neurodegenerative disorders, and, in particular, CNS disorders. CNS disorders can be drug induced; can be attributed to genetic predisposition, infection or trauma; or can be of unknown etiology. CNS disorders comprise neuropsychiatric disorders, neurological diseases and mental illnesses, and include neurodegenerative diseases, behavioral disorders, cognitive disorders and cognitive affective disorders. There are several CNS disorders whose clinical manifestations have been attributed to CNS dysfunction (i.e., disorders resulting from inappropriate levels of neurotransmitter release, inappropriate properties of neurotransmitter receptors, and/or inappropriate interaction between neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter receptors). Several CNS disorders can be attributed to a deficiency of choline, dopamine, norepinephrine and/or serotonin.\n\n\nExamples of CNS disorders that can be treated in accordance with the present invention include pre-senile dementia (early onset Alzheimer's disease), senile dementia (dementia of the Alzheimer's type), Lewy Body dementia, micro-infarct dementia, AIDS-related dementia, HIV-dementia, multiple cerebral infarcts, Parkinsonism including Parkinson's disease, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington's chorea, tardive dyskinesia, hyperkinesia, mania, attention deficit disorder, anxiety, depression, dyslexia, schizophrenia depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, Tourette's syndrome, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), age-associated memory impairment (AAMI), premature amnesic and cognitive disorders which are age-related or a consequence of alcoholism, or immunodeficiency syndrome, or are associated with vascular disorders, with genetic alterations (such as, for example, trisomy 21) or with attention deficiencies or learning deficiencies, acute or chronic neurodegenerative conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neurotrophies, and cerebral or spinal traumas. In addition, the compounds can be used to treat nicotine addiction and/or other behavioral disorders related to substances that lead to dependency (e.g., alcohol, cocaine, heroin and opiates, psychostimulants, benzodiazepines and barbiturates).\n\n\nSchizophrenia is an example of a CNS disorder that is particularly amenable to treatment by modulating the α7 nAChR subtype. The compounds can also be administered to improve cognition and/or provide neuroprotection, and these uses are also particularly amenable to treatment with compounds, such as the compounds of the present invention, that are specific for the α7 nAChR subtype.\n\n\nThe disorders can be treated and/or prevented by administering to a patient in need of treatment or prevention thereof an effective treatment or preventative amount of a compound that provides some degree of prevention of the progression of a CNS disorder (i.e., provides protective effects), ameliorating the symptoms of the disorder, and ameliorating the recurrence of the disorder.\n\n\nAnti-Inflammatory Uses\n\n\nExcessive inflammation and tumor necrosis factor synthesis cause morbidity and even mortality in a variety of diseases. These diseases include, but are not limited to, endotoxemia, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, and irritable bowel disease. The nervous system, primarily through the vagus nerve, is known to regulate the magnitude of the innate immune response by inhibiting the release of macrophage tumor necrosis factor (TNF). This physiological mechanism is known as the “cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway” (see, for example, Tracey, “The inflammatory reflex,” \nNature. \n420:853-9 (2002)).\n\n\nThe nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7 subunit is required for acetylcholine inhibition of macrophage TNF release, and also inhibits release of other cytokines. Agonists (or, at elevated dosages, partial agonists) at the α7-specific receptor subtype can inhibit the TNF-modulated inflammatory response. Accordingly, those compounds described herein that are α7 agonists can be used to treat inflammatory disorders characterized by excessive synthesis of TNF (See also Wang et al., “Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7 subunit is an essential regulator of inflammation”, \nNature, \n421:384-8 (2003)).\n\n\nInflammatory conditions that can be treated or prevented by administering the compounds described herein include, but are not limited to, chronic and acute inflammation, psoriasis, gout, acute pseudogout, acute gouty arthritis, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, allograft rejection, chronic transplant rejection, asthma, atherosclerosis, mononuclear-phagocyte dependent lung injury, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, atopic dermatitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adult respiratory distress syndrome, acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, acute cholangitis, aphteous stomatitis, glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, thrombosis, and graft vs. host reaction.\n\n\nMinimizing the Inflammatory Response Associated with Bacterial and/or Viral Infection\n\n\nMany bacterial and/or viral infections are associated with side effects brought on by the formation of toxins, and the body's natural response to the bacteria or virus and/or the toxins. Examples of such bacterial infections include anthrax, botulism, and sepsis. As discussed above, the body's response to infection often involves generating a significant amount of TNF and/or other cytokines. The over-expression of these cytokines can result in significant injury, such as septic shock (when the bacteria is sepsis), endotoxic shock, urosepsis and toxic shock syndrome.\n\n\nCytokine expression is mediated by the α7 nAChR, and can be inhibited by administering agonists or partial agonists of these receptors. Those compounds described herein that are agonists or partial agonists of these receptors can therefore be used to minimize the inflammatory response associated with bacterial infection, as well as viral and fungal infections. Certain of the compounds themselves may also have antimicrobial properties.\n\n\nThese compounds can also be used as adjunct therapy in combination with existing therapies to manage bacterial, viral and fungal infections, such as antibiotics, antivirals and antifungals. Antitoxins can also be used to bind to toxins produced by the infectious agents and allow the bound toxins to pass through the body without generating an inflammatory response. Examples of antitoxins are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,310,043 to Bundle et al., incorporated herein by reference. Other agents effective against bacterial and other toxins can be effective and their therapeutic effect can be complimented by co-administration with the compounds described herein.\n\n\nAnalgesic Uses\n\n\nThe compounds can be administered to treat and/or prevent pain, including neurologic, neuropathic and chronic pain. The analgesic activity of compounds described herein can be demonstrated in models of persistent inflammatory pain and of neuropathic pain, performed as described in U.S. Published Patent Application No. 20010056084 A1 (Allgeier et al.) (e.g., mechanical hyperalgesia in the complete Freund's adjuvant rat model of inflammatory pain and mechanical hyperalgesia in the mouse partial sciatic nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain).\n\n\nThe analgesic effect is suitable for treating pain of various genesis or etiology, in particular in treating inflammatory pain and associated hyperalgesia, neuropathic pain and associated hyperalgesia, chronic pain (e.g., severe chronic pain, post-operative pain and pain associated with various conditions including cancer, angina, renal or billiary colic, menstruation, migraine and gout). Inflammatory pain may be of diverse genesis, including arthritis and rheumatoid disease, teno-synovitis and vasculitis. Neuropathic pain includes trigeminal or herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy pain, causalgia, low back pain and deafferentation syndromes such as brachial plexus avulsion.\n\n\nInhibition of Neovascularization\n\n\nThe α7 nAChR is also associated with neovascularization. Inhibition of neovascularization, for example, by administering antagonists (or at certain dosages, partial agonists) of the α7 nAChR can treat or prevent conditions characterized by undesirable neovascularization or angiogenesis. Such conditions can include those characterized by inflammatory angiogenesis and/or ischemia-induced angiogenesis. Neovascularization associated with tumor growth can also be inhibited by administering those compounds described herein that function as antagonists or partial agonists of α7 nAChR.\n\n\nSpecific antagonism of α7 nAChR-specific activity reduces the angiogenic response to inflammation, ischemia, and neoplasia. Guidance regarding appropriate animal model systems for evaluating the compounds described herein can be found, for example, in Heeschen, C. et al., “A novel angiogenic pathway mediated by non-neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,” \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n110(4):527-36 (2002), incorporated herein by reference regarding disclosure of α7-specific inhibition of angiogenesis and cellular (in vitro) and animal modeling of angiogenic activity relevant to human disease, especially the Lewis lung tumor model (in vivo, in mice—see, in particular, pages 529, and 532-533).\n\n\nRepresentative tumor types that can be treated using the compounds described herein include NSCLC, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast carcinoma, colon carcinoma, rectum carcinoma, lung carcinoma, oropharynx carcinoma, hypopharynx carcinoma, esophagus carcinoma, stomach carcinoma, pancreas carcinoma, liver carcinoma, gallbladder carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma, small intestine carcinoma, urinary tract carcinoma, kidney carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, urothelium carcinoma, female genital tract carcinoma, cervix carcinoma, uterus carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, gestational trophoblastic disease, male genital tract carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, seminal vesicles carcinoma, testes carcinoma, germ cell tumors, endocrine gland carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, adrenal carcinoma, pituitary gland carcinoma, skin carcinoma, hemangiomas, melanomas, sarcomas, bone and soft tissue sarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, tumors of the brain, tumors of the nerves, tumors of the eyes, tumors of the meninges, astrocytomas, gliomas, glioblastomas, retinoblastomas, neuromas, neuroblastomas, Schwannomas, meningiomas, solid tumors arising from hematopoietic malignancies (such as leukemias, chloromas, plasmacytomas and the plaques and tumors of mycosis fungoides and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/leukemia), and solid tumors arising from lymphomas.\n\n\nThe compounds can also be administered in conjunction with other forms of anti-cancer treatment, including co-administration with antineoplastic antitumor agents such as cis-platin, adriamycin, daunomycin, and the like, and/or anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agents, as such are known in the art.\n\n\nThe compounds can be administered in such a manner that they are targeted to the tumor site. For example, the compounds can be administered in microspheres, microparticles or liposomes conjugated to various antibodies that direct the microparticles to the tumor. Additionally, the compounds can be present in microspheres, microparticles or liposomes that are appropriately sized to pass through the arteries and veins, but lodge in capillary beds surrounding tumors and administer the compounds locally to the tumor. Such drug delivery devices are known in the art.\n\n\nOther Disorders\n\n\nIn addition to treating CNS disorders, inflammatory disorders, and neovascular disorders, and inhibiting the pain response, the compounds can be also used to prevent or treat certain other conditions, diseases, and disorders. Examples include autoimmune disorders such as Lupus, disorders associated with cytokine release, cachexia secondary to infection (e.g., as occurs in AIDS, AIDS related complex and neoplasia), as well as those indications set forth in PCT WO 98/25619. The compounds can also be administered to treat convulsions such as those that are symptomatic of epilepsy, and to treat conditions such as syphillis and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease.\n\n\nDiagnostic Uses\n\n\nThe compounds can be used in diagnostic compositions, such as probes, particularly when they are modified to include appropriate labels. The probes can be used, for example, to determine the relative number and/or function of specific receptors, particularly the α7 receptor subtype. The compounds of the present invention most preferably are labeled with a radioactive isotopic moiety such as \n11\nC, \n18\nF, \n76\nBr, \n123\nI or \n125\nI, as discussed above.\n\n\nThe administered compounds can be detected using known detection methods appropriate for the label used. Examples of detection methods include position emission topography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The radiolabels described above are useful in PET (e.g., \n11\nC, \n18\nF or \n76\nBr) and SPECT (e.g., \n123\nI) imaging, with half-lives of about 20.4 minutes for \n11\nC, about 109 minutes for \n18\nF, about 13 hours for \n123\nI, and about 16 hours for \n76\nBr. A high specific activity is desired to visualize the selected receptor subtypes at non-saturating concentrations. The administered doses typically are below the toxic range and provide high contrast images. The compounds are expected to be capable of administration in non-toxic levels. Determination of dose is carried out in a manner known to one skilled in the art of radiolabel imaging. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,969,144 to London et al.\n\n\nThe compounds can be administered using known techniques. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,969,144 to London et al. The compounds can be administered in formulation compositions that incorporate other ingredients, such as those types of ingredients that are useful in formulating a diagnostic composition. Compounds useful in accordance with carrying out the present invention most preferably are employed in forms of high purity. See, U.S. Pat. No. 5,853,696 to Elmalch et al.\n\n\nAfter the compounds are administered to a subject (e.g., a human subject), the presence of that compound within the subject can be imaged and quantified by appropriate techniques in order to indicate the presence, quantity, and functionality of selected nicotinic cholinergic receptor subtypes. In addition to humans, the compounds can also be administered to animals, such as mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. SPECT and PET imaging can be carried out using any appropriate technique and apparatus. See Villemagne et al., In: Arneric et al. (Eds.) \nNeuronal Nicotinic Receptors Pharmacology and Therapeutic Opportunities, \n235-250 (1998) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,853,696 to Elmalch et al. for a disclosure of representative imaging techniques.\n\n\nThe radiolabeled compounds bind with high affinity to selective nAChR subtypes (e.g., α7) and preferably exhibit negligible non-specific binding to other nicotinic cholinergic receptor subtypes (e.g., those receptor subtypes associated with muscle and ganglia). As such, the compounds can be used as agents for noninvasive imaging of nicotinic cholinergic receptor subtypes within the body of a subject, particularly within the brain for diagnosis associated with a variety of CNS diseases and disorders.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the diagnostic compositions can be used in a method to diagnose disease in a subject, such as a human patient. The method involves administering to that patient a detectably labelled compound as described herein, and detecting the binding of that compound to selected nicotinic receptor subtypes (e.g., α7 receptor subtype). Those skilled in the art of using diagnostic tools, such as PET and SPECT, can use the radiolabeled compounds described herein to diagnose a wide variety of conditions and disorders, including conditions and disorders associated with dysfunction of the central and autonomic nervous systems. Such disorders include a wide variety of CNS diseases and disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. These and other representative diseases and disorders that can be evaluated include those that are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,952,339 to Bencherif et al., the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the diagnostic compositions can be used in a method to monitor selective nicotinic receptor subtypes of a subject, such as a human patient. The method involves administering a detectably labeled compound as described herein to that patient and detecting the binding of that compound to selected nicotinic receptor subtypes (e.g., the α7 receptor subtype).\n\n\nThe following examples are provided to further illustrate the present invention, and should not be construed as limiting thereof.\n\n\nIV. Synthetic Examples\n\n\nThe following synthetic examples are provided to illustrate the present invention and should not be construed as limiting the scope thereof. In these examples, all parts and percentages are by weight, unless otherwise noted. Reaction yields are reported in mole percentage.\n\n\nThe first step in synthesizing the compounds of interest is to synthesize 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one, as described below:\n\n\n2-((3-Pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one\n\n\nPotassium hydroxide (56 g, 0.54 mole) was dissolved in methanol (420 mL). 3-Quinuclidinone hydrochloride (75 g, 0.49 mole) was added and the mixture was stirred for 30 min at ambient temperature. 3-Pyridinecarboxaldehyde (58 g, 0.54 mole) was added and the mixture stirred for 16 h at ambient temperature. The reaction mixture became yellow during this period, with solids caking on the walls of the flask. The solids were scraped from the walls and the chunks broken up. With rapid stirring, water (390 mL) was added. When the solids dissolved, the mixture was cooled at 4° C. overnight. The crystals were collected by filtration, washed with water, and air dried to obtain 80 g of yellow solid. A second crop (8 g) was obtained by concentration of the filtrate to ˜10% of its former volume and cooling at 4° C. overnight. Both crops were sufficiently pure for further transformation (88 g, 82%).\n\n\n2-((3-Pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one\n\n\n2-((3-Pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one (20 g, 93 mmol) was suspended in methanol (200 mL) and treated with 46 mL of 6NHC1.10% Palladium on carbon (1.6 g) was added and the mixture was shaken under 25 psi hydrogen for 16 h. The mixture was filtered through Celite and solvent removed from the filtrate by rotary evaporation, to give crude 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one hydrochloride as a white gum (20 g). This was treated with 2N NaOH (50 mL) and chloroform (50 mL) and stirred for an hour. The chloroform layer was separated and the aqueous phase was treated with 2N NaOH, enough to raise the pH to 10 (about 5 mL), and saturated aqueous NaCl (25 mL). This was extracted with chloroform (3×10 mL), and the combined extracts were dried (MgSO\n4\n) and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residue (18 g) was dissolved in warm ether (320 mL) and cooled to 4° C. The white solid was filtered off, washed with a small portion of cold ether and air dried. Concentration of the filtrate to ˜10% of its former volume and cooling at 4° C. produced a second crop. A combined yield 16 g (79%) was obtained.\n\n\nThe 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one can then be used to produce the scaffolds from which the remaining examples were synthesized. The synthesis of the three scaffolds and their separation into individual enantiomers was accomplished by the following procedures.\n\n\nScaffold 1: 2-((3-Pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol\n\n\nIn accordance with the procedure reported by Warawa et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n17(5): 497 (1974), a 250 mL three-neck round bottom flask was fitted with a Vigreux column and distilling head. 2-((3-Pyridinypmethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one (3.00 g, 13.9 mmol), isopropanol (165 mL), aluminum isopropoxide (10.4 g, 50.9 mmol) and four boiling chips were added to the flask. The mixture was slowly distilled under nitrogen, the distillate being collected over a 3 h period. When the distillate no longer showed the presence of acetone (by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone formation), the distillation was stopped and the reaction mixture cooled to ambient temperature. The volatiles were removed by rotary evaporation and the gelatinous residue was diluted with saturated aqueous NaCl (50 mL) and 50% aqueous NaOH (10 mL). The mixture was then extracted with chloroform (3×25 mL), and the extracts were combined, dried over MgSO\n4\n, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The resulting amber oil became a cream-colored solid (3.02 g, 99.7% yield) upon high vacuum treatment. GCMS analysis indicated that the product is a 93:7 mixture of diastereomers. That the cis relative configuration of 2-[(pyridin-3-yl)methyl]quinuclidin-3-ol was the major diastereomer was established by comparison of the 3-H chemical shift with corresponding chemical shifts of cis- and trans-2-(arylmethyl)quinuclidin-3-ols (Warawa and Campbell, \nJ. Org. Chem. \n39(24): 3511 (1974)).\n\n\n(R,R) and (S,S)-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol\n\n\nA mixture of (cis)-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol (1.97 g, 9.04 mmol), N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (3.73 g, 18.1 mmol), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (55 mg, 0.40 mmol), (S)-2-methoxy-2-phenylacetic acid (3.00 g, 18.1 mmol), and anhydrous dichloromethane (125 mL) was stirred at ambient temperature under nitrogen for 24 h. The precipitated N,N-dicyclohexylurea was filtered from the reaction mixture and the filtrate was extracted sequentially with water (200 mL), saturated aqueous NaHCO\n3 \n(200 mL) and saturated aqueous NaCl (200 mL). The organic layer was dried (MgSO\n4\n), filtered and concentrated to give a dark orange oil (4.45 g). A portion (4.2 g) of this diastereomeric mixture was dissolved in acetonitrile (8.4 mL) and separated, in portions, by preparative HPLC, using 90:10:0.1 acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid as eluent. The diastereomers exhibited retention times of 3.8 min and 4.5 min. The corresponding fractions from the various injections were combined and concentrated to yield 1.1 g (56% yield) and 0.70 g (36% yield), respectively, as clear, colorless oils. LCMS analysis of the solvent-free esters confirmed the efficiency of their separation, showing diastereomeric purities of 92% (for the 3.8 min fraction) and 95% (for the 4.5 min fraction).\n\n\nIn separate flasks, portions (0.175 g, 0.477 mmol) of each of the diastereomers were dissolved in methanol (2.5 mL) and treated with solutions of KOH (0.20 g, 3.6 mmol) in methanol (3 mL). These mixtures were stirred overnight at ambient temperature. The methanol was removed by evaporation, and the residues were diluted with a mixture of saturated aqueous NaCl (2 mL) and 50% NaOH (1 mL) and then extracted with chloroform (3×5 mL). For each of the hydrolyses, the organic layers were combined, dried (MgSO\n4\n), filtered, and concentrated. This gave 0.061 g (59% yield) of the enantiomer derived from the 3.8 min peak and 0.056 g (54% yield) of the enantiomer derived from the 4.5 min peak. Both were clear, colorless oils.\n\n\nScaffold 2: 3-Amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane\n\n\nTo a stirred solution of 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one (3.00 g, 13.9 mmol) in dry methanol (20 mL), under nitrogen, was added a 1 M solution of ZnCl\n2 \nin ether (2.78 mL, 2.78 mmol). After stirring at ambient temperature for 30 min, this mixture was treated with solid ammonium formate (10.4 g, 167 mmol). After stirring another hour at ambient temperature, solid sodium cyanoborohydride (1.75 g, 27.8 mmol) was added in portions. The reaction was then stirred at ambient temperature overnight and terminated by addition of water (˜5 mL). The quenched reaction was partitioned between 5 M NaOH (10 mL) and chloroform (20 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with chloroform (20 mL), and combined organic layers were dried (Na\n2\nSO\n4\n), filtered and concentrated. This left 2.97 g of yellow gum. GC/MS analysis indicated that the product was a 90:10 mixture of the cis and trans amines, along with a trace of the corresponding alcohol (98% mass recovery).\n\n\n(R,R) and (S,S)-3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane\n\n\nDi-p-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid (5.33 g, 13.8 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of crude 3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (6.00 g, 27.6 mmol of 9:1 cis/trans) in methanol (20 mL). After complete dissolution, the clear solution was then concentrated to a solid mass by rotary evaporation. The solid was dissolved in a minimum amount of boiling methanol (˜5 mL). The solution was cooled slowly, first to ambient temperature (1 h), then for ˜4 h at 5° C. and finally at −5° C. overnight. The precipitated salt was collected by suction filtration and recrystallized from 5 mL of methanol. Drying left 1.4 g of white solid, which was partitioned between chloroform (5 mL) and 2 M NaOH (5 mL). The chloroform layer and a 5 mL chloroform extract of the aqueous layer were combined, dried (Na\n2\nSO\n4\n) and concentrated to give a colorless oil (0.434 g). The enantiomeric purity of this free base was determined by conversion of a portion into its N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-L-prolinamide, which was then analyzed for diastereomeric purity (98%) using LCMS.\n\n\nThe mother liquor from the initial crystallization was made basic (˜pH 11) with 2 M NaOH and extracted twice with chloroform (10 mL). The chloroform extracts were dried (Na\n2\nSO\n4\n) and concentrated to give an oil. This amine (3.00 g, 13.8 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (10 mL) and treated with di-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid (2.76 g, 6.90 mmol). The mixture was warmed to aid dissolution and then cooled slowly to −5° C., where it remained overnight. The precipitate was collected by suction filtration, recrystallized and dried. This left 1.05 g of white solid. The salt was converted into the free base as described above for the other isomer (yield=0.364 g), and the enantiomeric purity (97%) was assessed using the prolinamide method, described above.\n\n\nScaffold 3: 3-Aminomethyl-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane\n\n\n2-((3-Pyridinypmethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one (2.16 g, 0.01 mol), methylamine (25 mL, 0.05 mol) and zinc chloride (5 mL, 0.005 mol) were added to dry methanol (30 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Then, sodium cyanoborohydride (30 mL, 1.0M in THF) was added carefully and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 48 h. The mixture was adjusted to pH 10 using 2N potassium hydroxide and then the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The residue was extracted with chloroform (3×50 mL), dried (MgSO\n4\n), filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation to yield the crude desired amine as a light yellow oil (2.40 g, 83% yield). The product was taken on to the next step without further purification.\n\n\nThe following example describes the synthesis of various 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl N-arylcarbamates, which are built upon Scaffold 1.

The reaction mixtures were heated at 100° C. for 3 h and concentrated by centrifugal evaporation. The residues were dissolved in DMF (0.5 mL) and purified by HPLC on a C18 silica gel column, using acetonitrile/water gradients containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid as eluent. Compounds were isolated as trifluoroacetate salts and characterized by LCMS. All compounds exhibited appropriate molecular ions and fragmentation patterns.

The volatiles were removed by rotary evaporation, and the residue was purified by flash (silica gel) column chromatography, using first chloroform/hexane/methanol/ammonia (68:25:7:1) and then chloroform/methanol/ammonia (90:10:1) as eluent. Concentration of selected fractions gave 0.260 g (62.5% yield) of colorless oil, which formed a waxy white solid upon standing at ambient temperature.

Animals were anesthetized with 70% CO\n2\n, then decapitated. Brains were removed and placed on an ice-cold platform. The cerebral cortex was removed and placed in 20 volumes (weight:volume) of ice-cold preparative buffer (137 mM NaCl, 10.7 mM KCl, 5.8 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 8 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 20 mM HEPES (free acid), 5 mM iodoacetamide, 1.6 mM EDTA, pH 7.4); PMSF, dissolved in methanol to a final concentration of 100 uM, was added and the suspension was homogenized by Polytron. The homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000×g for 20 min at 4° C. and the resulting pellet was re-suspended in 20 volumes of ice-cold water. After 60 min incubation on ice, a new pellet was collected by centrifugation at 18,000×g for 20 min at 4° C. The final pellet was re-suspended in 10 volumes of buffer and stored at −20° C. On the day of the assay, tissue was thawed, centrifuged at 18,000×g for 20 min, and then re-suspended in ice-cold PBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline, 138 mM NaCl, 2.67 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 8.1 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.9 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, Invitrogen/Gibco, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of approximately 4 mg protein/mL. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n193: 265 (1951), using bovine serum albumin as the standard.\n\n\nThe binding of [\n3\nH]nicotine was measured using a modification of the methods of Romano et al., \nScience \n210: 647 (1980) and Marks et al., \nMol. Pharmacol. \n30: 427 (1986). The [\n3\nH]nicotine (Specific Activity=81.5 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Research Products. The binding of [\n3\nH]nicotine was measured using a 3 h incubation at 4° C. Incubations were conducted in 48-well micro-titre plates and contained about 400 μg of protein per well in a final incubation volume of 300 μL. The incubation buffer was PBS and the final concentration of [\n3\nH]nicotine was 5 nM. The binding reaction was terminated by filtration of the protein containing bound ligand onto glass fiber filters (GF/B, Brandel) using a Brandel Tissue Harvester at 4° C. Filters were soaked in de-ionized water containing 0.33% polyethyleneimine to reduce non-specific binding. Each filter was washed with ice-cold buffer (3×1 mL). Non-specific binding was determined by inclusion of 10 μM non-radioactive L-nicotine (Acros Organics) in selected wells.\n\n\nThe inhibition of [\n3\nH]nicotine binding by test compounds was determined by including seven different concentrations of the test compound in selected wells. Each concentration was replicated in triplicate. IC\n50 \nvalues were estimated as the concentration of compound that inhibited 50 percent of specific [\n3\nH]nicotine binding. Inhibition constants (Ki values), reported in nM, were calculated from the IC\n50 \nvalues using the method of Cheng et al., \nBiochem. Pharmacol. \n22: 3099 (1973).\n\n\nFor initial screening, a single concentration of test compounds was tested in the above assay format with the following modifications. The binding of [\n3\nH]epibatidine was measured. The [\n3\nH]epibatidine (Specific Activity=48 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Research Products. The binding of [\n3\nH]epibatidine was measured using a 2 h incubation at 21° C. (room temperature). Incubations were conducted in 96-well Millipore Multiscreen (MAFB) plates containing about 200 μg of protein per well in a final incubation volume of 150 μL. The incubation buffer was PBS and the final concentration of [\n3\nH]epibatidine was 0.3 nM. The binding reaction was terminated by filtration of the protein containing bound ligand onto the glass fiber filter base of the Multiscreen plates. Filters were soaked in de-ionized water containing 0.33% polyethyleneimine to reduce non-specific binding. Each filter was washed with ice-cold buffer (3×0.25 mL). Non-specific binding was determined by inclusion of 10 μM non-radioactive L-nicotine (Acros Organics) in selected wells. The single concentration of test compound was 5 μM and testing was performed in triplicate. ‘Active’ compounds were defined as compounds that inhibited the binding of [\n3\nH]epibatidine to the receptor by at least 50% compared with the binding of [\n3\nH]epibatidine in the absence of competitor. For those compounds found to be active in the single point screen, the inhibition constants (Ki values) were determined as described in the previous paragraphs of this section.\n\n\nα7 nAChR Subtype\n\n\nRats (female, Sprague-Dawley), weighing 150-250 g, were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle and were allowed free access to water and food supplied by PMI Nutrition International, Inc. Animals were anesthetized with 70% CO\n2\n, then decapitated. Brains were removed and placed on an ice-cold platform. The hippocampus was removed and placed in 10 volumes (weight:volume) of ice-cold preparative buffer (137 mM NaCl, 10.7 mM KCl, 5.8 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 8 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 20 mM HEPES (free acid), 5 mM iodoacetamide, 1.6 mM EDTA, pH 7.4); PMSF, dissolved in methanol to a final concentration of 100 μM, was added and the tissue suspension was homogenized by Polytron. The homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000×g for 20 min at 4° C. and the resulting pellet was re-suspended in 10 volumes of ice-cold water.

On the day of the assay, tissue was thawed, centrifuged at 18,000×g for 20 min, and then re-suspended in ice-cold PBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline, 138 mM NaCl, 2.67 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 8.1 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.9 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, Invitrogen/Gibco, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of approximately 2 mg protein/mL. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n193: 265 (1951), using bovine serum albumin as the standard.\n\n\nThe binding of [\n3\nH]MLA was measured using a modification of the methods of Davies et al., Neuropharmacol. 38: 679 (1999). [\n3\nH]MLA (Specific Activity=25-35 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Tocris. The binding of [\n3\nH]MLA was determined using a 2 h incubation at 21° C. Incubations were conducted in 48-well micro-titre plates and contained about 200 μg of protein per well in a final incubation volume of 300 μL. The incubation buffer was PBS and the final concentration of [\n3\nH]MLA was 5 nM. The binding reaction was terminated by filtration of the protein containing bound ligand onto glass fiber filters (GF/B, Brandel) using a Brandel Tissue Harvester at room temperature. Filters were soaked in de-ionized water containing 0.33% polyethyleneimine to reduce non-specific binding. Each filter was washed with PBS (3×1 mL) at room temperature. Non-specific binding was determined by inclusion of 50 μM non-radioactive MLA in selected wells.\n\n\nThe inhibition of [\n3\nH]MLA binding by test compounds was determined by including seven different concentrations of the test compound in selected wells. Each concentration was replicated in triplicate. IC\n50 \nvalues were estimated as the concentration of compound that inhibited 50 percent of specific [\n3\nH]MLA binding. Inhibition constants (Ki values), reported in nM, were calculated from the IC\n50 \nvalues using the method of Cheng et al., \nBiochem. Pharmacol. \n22: 3099-3108 (1973).\n\n\nFor initial screening, a single concentration of test compounds was tested in the above assay format with the following modifications. Incubations were conducted in 96-well plates in a final incubation volume of 150 μL. Once the binding reaction was terminated by filtration onto glass fiber filters, the filters were washed four times with approximately 250 μL of PBS at room temperature. Non-specific binding was determined by inclusion of 10 μM non-radioactive MLA in selected wells. The single concentration of test compound was 5 μM and testing was performed in triplicate. ‘Active’ compounds were defined as compounds that inhibited the binding of [\n3\nH]MLA to the receptor by at least 50% compared with the binding of [\n3\nH]MLA in the absence of competitor. For those compounds found to be active in the single point screen, the inhibition constants (Ki values) were determined as described in the previous paragraphs of this section.\n\n\nDetermination of Dopamine Release\n\n\nDopamine release was measured using striatal synaptosomes obtained from rat brain, according to the procedures set forth by Rapier et al., \nJ. Neurochem. \n54: 937 (1990). Rats (female, Sprague-Dawley), weighing 150-250 g, were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle and were allowed free access to water and food supplied by PMI Nutrition International, Inc. Animals were anesthetized with 70% CO\n2\n, then decapitated. The brains were quickly removed and the striata dissected. Striatal tissue from each of 2 rats was pooled and homogenized in ice-cold 0.32 M sucrose (5 mL) containing 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, using a glass/glass homogenizer. The tissue was then centrifuged at 1,000×g for 10 min. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000×g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was re-suspended in perfusion buffer containing monoamine oxidase inhibitors (128 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.4 mM KCl, 3.2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1.2 mM MgSO\n4\n, 25 mM HEPES, 1 mM ascorbic acid, 0.02 mM pargyline HCl and 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) and centrifuged for 15 min at 25,000×g. The final pellet was resuspended in perfusion buffer (1.4 mL) for immediate use.\n\n\nThe synaptosomal suspension was incubated for 10 min at 37° C. to restore metabolic activity. [\n3\nH]Dopamine ([\n3\nH]DA, specific activity=28.0 Ci/mmol, NEN Research Products) was added at a final concentration of 0.1 μM and the suspension was incubated at 37° C. for another 10 min. Aliquots of tissue (50 μL) and perfusion buffer (100 μL) were loaded into the suprafusion chambers of a Brandel Suprafusion System (series 2500, Gaithersburg, Md.). Perfusion buffer (room temperature) was pumped into the chambers at a rate of 3 mL/min for a wash period of 8 min. Test compound (10 μM) or nicotine (10 μM) was then applied in the perfusion stream for 40 sec. Fractions (12 sec each) were continuously collected from each chamber throughout the experiment to capture basal release and agonist-induced peak release and to re-establish the baseline after the agonist application. The perfusate was collected directly into scintillation vials, to which scintillation fluid was added. [\n3\nH]DA released was quantified by scintillation counting. For each chamber, the integrated area of the peak was normalized to its baseline.\n\n\nRelease was expressed as a percentage of release obtained with an equal concentration of L-nicotine. Within each assay, each test compound was replicated using 2-3 chambers; replicates were averaged. When appropriate, dose-response curves of test compound were determined. The maximal activation for individual compounds (Emax) was determined as a percentage of the maximal activation induced by L-nicotine. The compound concentration resulting in half maximal activation (EC\n50\n) of specific ion flux was also defined.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nSelectivity vs. Peripheral nAChRs\n\n\nInteraction at the Human Muscle nAChR Subtype\n\n\nActivation of muscle-type nAChRs was established on the human clonal line TE671/RD, which is derived from an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (Stratton et al., Carcinogen 10: 899 (1989)). These cells express receptors that have pharmacological (Lukas, \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n251: 175 (1989)), electrophysiological (Oswald et al., \nNeurosci. Lett. \n96: 207 (1989)), and molecular biological profiles (Luther et al., \nJ. Neurosci. \n9: 1082 (1989)) similar to the muscle-type nAChR.\n\n\nTE671/RD cells were maintained in proliferative growth phase according to routine protocols (Bencherif et al., \nMol. Cell. Neurosci. \n2: 52 (1991) and Bencherif et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n257: 946 (1991)). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco/BRL) with 10% horse serum (Gibco/BRL), 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan Utah), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 4 mM L-Glutamine, and 50,000 units penicillin-streptomycin (Irvine Scientific). When cells were 80% confluent, they were plated to 6 well polystyrene plates (Costar). Experiments were conducted when the cells reached 100% confluency.\n\n\nNicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function was assayed using \n86\nRb\n+\n efflux according to the method described by Lukas et al., \nAnal. Biochem. \n175: 212 (1988). On the day of the experiment, growth media was gently removed from the well and growth media containing \n86\nRubidium chloride (10\n6 \nμCi/mL) was added to each well. Cells were incubated at 37° C. for a minimum of 3 h. After the loading period, excess \n86\nRb\n+\n was removed and the cells were washed twice with label-free Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (138 mM NaCl, 2.67 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 8.1 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.9 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, Invitrogen/Gibco, pH. 7.4), taking care not to disturb the cells. Next, cells were exposed to either 100 μM of test compound, 100 μM of L-nicotine (Acros Organics) or buffer alone for 4 min. Following the exposure period, the supernatant containing the released \n86\nRb\n+\n was removed and transferred to scintillation vials. Scintillation fluid was added and released radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting.\n\n\nWithin each assay, each point had 2 replicates, which were averaged. The amount of \n86\nRb\n+\n release was compared to both a positive control (100 μM L-nicotine) and a negative control (buffer alone) to determine the percent release relative to that of L-nicotine.\n\n\nWhen appropriate, dose-response curves of test compound were determined. The maximal activation for individual compounds (Emax) was determined as a percentage of the maximal activation induced by L-nicotine. The compound concentration resulting in half maximal activation (EC\n50\n) of specific ion flux was also determined.\n\n\nInteraction at the Rat Ganglionic nAChR Subtype\n\n\nActivation of rat ganglion nAChRs was established on the pheochromocytoma clonal line PC12, which is a continuous clonal cell line of neural crest origin, derived from a tumor of the rat adrenal medulla. These cells express ganglion-like nAChRs (see Whiting et al., \nNature \n327: 515 (1987); Lukas, \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n251: 175 (1989); Whiting et al., \nMol. Brain. Res. \n10: 61 (1990)).\n\n\nRat PC12 cells were maintained in proliferative growth phase according to routine protocols (Bencherif et al., \nMol. Cell. Neurosci. \n2: 52 (1991) and Bencherif et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n257: 946 (1991)). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco/BRL) with 10% horse serum (Gibco/BRL), 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan Utah), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 4 mM L-Glutamine, and 50,000 units penicillin-streptomycin (Irvine Scientific). When cells were 80% confluent, they were plated to 6 well Nunc plates (Nunclon) and coated with 0.03% poly-L-lysine (Sigma, dissolved in 100 mM boric acid). Experiments were conducted when the cells reached 80% confluency.\n\n\nNicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function was assayed using \n86\nRb\n+\n efflux according to a method described by Lukas et al., \nAnal. Biochem. \n175: 212 (1988). On the day of the experiment, growth media was gently removed from the well and growth media containing \n86\nRubidium chloride (10\n6 \nμCi/mL) was added to each well. Cells were incubated at 37° C. for a minimum of 3 h. After the loading period, excess \n86\nRb\n+\n was removed and the cells were washed twice with label-free Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (138 mM NaCl, 2.67 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 8.1 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.9 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, Invitrogen/Gibco, pH. 7.4), taking care not to disturb the cells. Next, cells were exposed to either 100 μM of test compound, 100 μM of nicotine or buffer alone for 4 min. Following the exposure period, the supernatant containing the released \n86\nRb\n+\n was removed and transferred to scintillation vials. Scintillation fluid was added and released radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting\n\n\nWithin each assay, each point had 2 replicates, which were averaged. The amount of \n86\nRb\n+\n release was compared to both a positive control (100 μM nicotine) and a negative control (buffer alone) to determine the percent release relative to that of L-nicotine.\n\n\nWhen appropriate, dose-response curves of test compound were determined. The maximal activation for individual compounds (Emax) was determined as a percentage of the maximal activation induced by L-nicotine. The compound concentration resulting in half maximal activation (EC\n50\n) of specific ion flux was also determined.\n\n\nInteraction at the Human Ganglionic nAChR Subtype\n\n\nThe cell line SH—SY5Y is a continuous line derived by sequential subcloning of the parental cell line, SK—N—SH, which was originally obtained from a human peripheral neuroblastoma. SH—SY5Y cells express a ganglion-like nAChR (Lukas et al., \nMol. Cell. Neurosci. \n4: 1 (1993)).\n\n\nHuman SH—SY5Y cells were maintained in proliferative growth phase according to routine protocols (Bencherif et al., \nMol. Cell. Neurosci. \n2: 52 (1991) and Bencherif et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n257: 946 (1991)). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco/BRL) with 10% horse serum (Gibco/BRL), 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan Utah), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 4 mM L-Glutamine, and 50,000 units penicillin-streptomycin (Irvine Scientific). When cells were 80% confluent, they were plated to 6 well polystyrene plates (Costar). Experiments were conducted when the cells reached 100% confluency.\n\n\nNicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function was assayed using \n86\nRb\n+\n efflux according to a method described by Lukas et al., \nAnal. Biochem. \n175: 212 (1988). On the day of the experiment, growth media was gently removed from the well and growth media containing \n86\nRubidium chloride (10\n6 \nμCi/mL) was added to each well. Cells were incubated at 37° C. for a minimum of 3 h. After the loading period, excess \n86\nRb\n+\n was removed and the cells were washed twice with label-free Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (138 mM NaCl, 2.67 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 8.1 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.9 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, Invitrogen/Gibco, pH 7.4), taking care not to disturb the cells. Next, cells were exposed to either 100 μM of test compound, 100 μM of nicotine, or buffer alone for 4 mM. Following the exposure period, the supernatant containing the released \n86\nRb\n+\n was removed and transferred to scintillation vials. Scintillation fluid was added and released radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting\n\n\nWithin each assay, each point had 2 replicates, which were averaged. The amount of \n86\nRb\n+\n release was compared to both a positive control (100 μM nicotine) and a negative control (buffer alone) to determine the percent release relative to that of L-nicotine.\n\n\nWhen appropriate, dose-response curves of test compound were determined. The maximal activation for individual compounds (Emax) was determined as a percentage of the maximal activation induced by L-nicotine. The compound concentration resulting in half maximal activation (EC\n50\n) of specific ion flux was also defined.\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nDetermination of Binding at Non-nicotinic Receptors\n\n\nMuscarinic M3 Subtype\n\n\nThe human clonal line TE671/RD, derived from an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (Stratton et al., \nCarcinogen \n10: 899 (1989)), was used to define binding to the muscarinic M3 receptor subtype. As evidenced through pharmacological (Bencherif et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n257: 946 (1991) and Lukas, \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n251: 175 (1989)), electrophysiological (Oswald et al., \nNeurosci. Lett. \n96: 207 (1989)), and molecular biological studies (Luther et al., \nJ. Neurosci. \n9: 1082 (1989)) these cells express muscle-like nicotinic receptors.\n\n\nTE671/cells were maintained in proliferative growth phase according to routine protocols (Bencherif et al., \nMol. Cell. Neurosci. \n2: 52 (1991) and Bencherif et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n257: 946 (1991)). They were grown to confluency on 20-150 mm tissue culture treated plates. The media was then removed and cells scraped using 80 mL of PBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline, 138 mM NaCl, 2.67 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 8.1 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.9 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, Invitrogen/Gibco, pH 7.4) and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was then suctioned off and the pellet(s) stored at −20° C. until use.\n\n\nOn the day of the assay, the pellets were thawed, re-suspended with PBS and centrifuged at 18,000×g for 20 min, then re-suspended in PBS to a final concentration of approximately 4 mg protein/mL and homogenized by Polytron. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n193: 265 (1951), using bovine serum albumin as the standard.\n\n\nThe binding of [\n3\nH]QNB was measured using a modification of the methods of Bencherif et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n257: 946 (1991). [\n3\nH]QNB (Specific Activity=30-60 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Research Products. The binding of [\n3\nH]QNB was measured using a 3 h incubation at 4° C. Incubations were conducted in 48-well micro-titre plates and contained about 400 μg of protein per well in a final incubation volume of 300 μL. The incubation buffer was PBS and the final concentration of [\n3\nH]QNB was 1 nM. The binding reaction was terminated by filtration of the protein containing bound ligand onto glass fiber filters (GF/B, Brandel) using a Brandel Tissue Harvester at 4° C. Filters were pre-soaked in de-ionized water containing 0.33% polyethyleneimine to reduce non-specific binding. Each filter was washed with ice-cold buffer (3×1 mL). Non-specific binding was determined by inclusion of 10 μM non-radioactive atropine in selected wells.\n\n\nThe inhibition of [\n3\nH]QNB binding by test compounds was determined by including seven different concentrations of the test compound in selected wells. Each concentration was replicated in triplicate. IC\n50 \nvalues were estimated as the concentration of compound that inhibited 50 percent of specific [\n3\nH]QNB binding. Inhibition constants (Ki values), reported in nM, were calculated from the IC\n50 \nvalues using the method of Cheng et al., \nBiochem. Pharmacol. \n22: 3099 (1973).\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nDetermination of Activity at the α7 nAChR Subtype\n\n\nSelective α7 agonists can be found using a functional assay on FLIPR (see, for example, PCT WO 00/73431 A2, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference), which is a commercially available high throughput assay (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, Calif.). FLIPR is designed to read the fluorescent signal from each well of a 96 or 384 well plate as fast as twice a second for up to 30 minutes. This assay can be used to accurately measure the functional pharmacology of α7 nAChR and 5HT\n3\nR subtypes. Cell lines that express functional forms of the α7 nAChR subtype using the α7/5-HT\n3 \nchannel as the drug target and/or cell lines that express functional 5-HT\n3 \nare used to conduct the assay. In both cases, the ligand-gated ion channels are expressed in SH-EP1 cells. Both ion channels can produce a robust signal in the FLIPR assay. Using the FLIPR assay, the compounds described herein can be evaluated for their ability to function as agonists, partial agonists or antagonists at the α7 nAChR subtype.\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nSummary of Biological Activity\n\n\nCompounds 1-34 competitively inhibited the binding of radiolabeled MLA to rat brain hippocampus α7 nAChR subtypes with an equilibrium constant (Ki) values of 0.5-60 nM, indicating that they have very high affinity for the α7 nAChR subtype. High-throughput screening indicated that none of the compounds bound to α4β2 nAChR subtypes with any significant affinity (Ki values >10 μM).\n\n\nCompounds 1-34 exhibited little or no agonist activity in functional models bearing muscle-type receptors (α1β1γδ subtype in human TE671/RD clonal cells), or ganglion-type receptors (α3β4 subtype in the Shooter subclone of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and in human SHSY-5Y clonal cells), generating only 1-12% (human muscle), 1-19% (rat ganglion) and 1-15% (human ganglion) of nicotine's response at these subtypes. These data indicate selectivity for CNS over PNS nAChRs. Because similar compounds had been described by others as exhibiting muscarinic activity (see, for instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,270 to Sabb and PCTs WO 02/00652 and WO 02/051841), representative compounds (#s 1, 2, 4, 9 and 11) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit [\n3\nH]QNB binding at muscarinic sites in the human clonal line TE671/RD. None of the compounds was able to inhibit [\n3\nH]QNB binding, indicating that these compounds do not bind to human M3 receptors. Thus, compounds of the present invention are distinguished in their in vitro pharmacology from reference compounds (see, for instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,270 to Sabb and PCTs WO 02/00652 and WO 02/051841) by virtue of the inclusion, in their structure, of the 3-pyridinylmethyl substituent in the 2 position of the 1-azabicycle.\n\n\nFollowing up on this intriguing finding, a comparison of α7 nAChR binding affinities was undertaken, to determine the effect of the 2-(3-pyridinyl)methyl substituent. The results are shown in Table 5. It is clear from the data that inclusion of the 2-(3-pyridinyl)-C\n1-4\nalkyl, preferably 2-(3-pyridinyl)methyl, substituent in the structure substantially increases binding affinity. Thus, compounds of the present invention exhibit both greater affinity at and greater selectivity for α7 nAChR subtypes than those compounds which lack the 2-(3-pyridinyl)alkyl, preferably 2-(3-pyridinyl)methyl, substituent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure\n\n\na7 Ki (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n120\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data show that the compounds of the present invention are potent α7 nicotinic ligands that selectively bind at α7 nAChR subtypes.

Thus, the compounds of the present invention possess therapeutic potential in treating central nervous system disorders without producing side effects associated with interaction with the peripheral nervous system.

In most mammals, including humans and mice, antibodies are constructed from paired heavy and light polypeptide chains. Each chain is made up of individual immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, and thus the generic term immunoglobulin is used for such proteins. Each chain is made up of two distinct regions, referred to as the variable and constant regions. The light and heavy chain variable regions show significant sequence diversity between antibodies, and are responsible for binding the target antigen. The constant regions show less sequence diversity, and are responsible for binding a number of natural proteins to elicit important biochemical events. In humans there are five different classes of antibodies including IgA (which includes subclasses IgA1 and IgA2), IgD, IgE, IgG (which includes subclasses IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4), and IgM. The distinguishing features between these antibody classes are their constant regions, although subtler differences may exist in the V region. \nFIG. 1\n shows an IgG1 antibody, used here as an example to describe the general structural features of immunoglobulins. IgG antibodies are tetrameric proteins composed of two heavy chains and two light chains. The IgG heavy chain is composed of four immunoglobulin domains linked from N- to C-terminus in the order V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3, referring to the heavy chain variable domain, \nconstant gamma\n 1 domain, \nconstant gamma\n 2 domain, and \nconstant gamma\n 3 domain respectively. The IgG light chain is composed of two immunoglobulin domains linked from N- to C-terminus in the order V\nL\n-C\nL\n, referring to the light chain variable domain and the light chain constant domain respectively.\n\n\nThe variable region of an antibody contains the antigen binding determinants of the molecule, and thus determines the specificity of an antibody for its target antigen. The variable region is so named because it is the most distinct in sequence from other antibodies within the same class. The majority of sequence variability occurs in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). There are 6 CDRs total, three each per heavy and light chain, designated V\nH \nCDR1, V\nH \nCDR2, V\nH \nCDR3, V\nL \nCDR1, V\nL \nCDR2, and V\nL \nCDR3. The variable region outside of the CDRs is referred to as the framework (FR) region. Although not as diverse as the CDRs, sequence variability does occur in the FR region between different antibodies. Overall, this characteristic architecture of antibodies provides a stable scaffold (the FR region) upon which substantial antigen binding diversity (the CDRs) can be explored by the immune system to obtain specificity for a broad array of antigens. A number of high-resolution structures are available for a variety of variable region fragments from different organisms, some unbound and some in complex with antigen. The sequence and structural features of antibody variable regions are well characterized (Morea et al., 1997\n, Biophys Chem \n68:9-16; Morea et al., 2000\n, Methods \n20:267-279), and the conserved features of antibodies have enabled the development of a wealth of antibody engineering techniques (Maynard et al., 2000\n, Annu Rev Biomed Eng \n2:339-376). For example, it is possible to graft the CDRs from one antibody, for example a murine antibody, onto the framework region of another antibody, for example a human antibody. This process, referred to in the art as “humanization”, enables generation of less immunogenic antibody therapeutics from nonhuman antibodies. Fragments comprising the variable region can exist in the absence of other regions of the antibody, including for example the antigen binding fragment (Fab) comprising V\nH\n-Cγ1 and V\nH\n-C\nL\n, the variable fragment (Fv) comprising V\nH \nand V\nL\n, the single chain variable fragment (scFv) comprising V\nH \nand V\nL \nlinked together in the same chain, as well as a variety of other variable region fragments (Little et al., 2000\n, Immunol Today \n21:364-370).\n\n\nThe Fc region of an antibody interacts with a number of Fc receptors and ligands, imparting an array of important functional capabilities referred to as effector functions. For IgG the Fc region, as shown in \nFIG. 1\n, comprises Ig domains Cγ2 and Cγ3 and the N-terminal hinge leading into Cγ2. An important family of Fc receptors for the IgG class are the Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs). These receptors mediate communication between antibodies and the cellular arm of the immune system (Raghavan et al., 1996\n, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol \n12:181-220; Ravetch et al., 2001\n, Annu Rev Immunol \n19:275-290). In humans this protein family includes FcγRI (CD64), including isoforms FcγRIa, FcγRIb, and FcγRIc; FcγRII (CD32), including isoforms FcγRIIa (including allotypes H131 and R131), FcγRIIb (including FcγRIIb-1 and FcγRIIb-2), and FcγRIIc; and FcγRIII (CD16), including isoforms FcγRIIIa (including allotypes V158 and F158) and FcγRIIIb (including allotypes FcγRIIIb-NA1 and FcγRIIIb-NA2) (Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65). These receptors typically have an extracellular domain that mediates binding to Fc, a membrane spanning region, and an intracellular domain that may mediate some signaling event within the cell. These receptors are expressed in a variety of immune cells including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, eosinophils, mast cells, platelets, B cells, large granular lymphocytes, Langerhans' cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and γγ T cells. Formation of the Fc/FcγR complex recruits these effector cells to sites of bound antigen, typically resulting in signaling events within the cells and important subsequent immune responses such as release of inflammation mediators, B cell activation, endocytosis, phagocytosis, and cytotoxic attack. The ability to mediate cytotoxic and phagocytic effector functions is a potential mechanism by which antibodies destroy targeted cells. The cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Raghavan et al., 1996\n, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol \n12:181-220; Ghetie et al., 2000\n, Annu Rev Immunol \n18:739-766; Ravetch et al., 2001\n, Annu Rev Immunol \n19:275-290). The cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP). A number of structures have been solved of the extracellular domains of human FcγRs, including FcγRIIa (pdb accession code 1H9V) (Sondermann et al., 2001\n, J Mol Biol \n309:737-749) (\npdb accession code\n 1 FCG) (Maxwell et al., 1999\n, Nat Struct Biol \n6:437-442), FcγRIIb (pdb accession code 2FCB) (Sondermann et al., 1999\n, Embo J \n18:1095-1103); and FcγRIIIb (pdb accession code 1E4J) (Sondermann et al., 2000\n, Nature \n406:267-273.). All FcγRs bind the same region on Fc, at the N-terminal end of the Cγ2 domain and the preceding hinge, shown in \nFIG. 2\n. This interaction is well characterized structurally (Sondermann et al., 2001\n, J Mol Biol \n309:737-749), and several structures of the human Fc bound to the extracellular domain of human FcγRIIIb have been solved (pdb accession code 1E4K) (Sondermann et al., 2000\n, Nature \n406:267-273.) (pdb accession codes 1IIS and 1IIX) (Radaev et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:16469-16477), as well as has the structure of the human IgE Fc/FcεRIα complex (pdb accession code 1F6A) (Garman et al., 2000\n, Nature \n406:259-266).\n\n\nThe different IgG subclasses have different affinities for the FcγRs, with IgG1 and IgG3 typically binding substantially better to the receptors than IgG2 and IgG4 (Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65). All FcγRs bind the same region on IgG Fc, yet with different affinities: the high affinity binder FcγRI has a Kd for IgG1 of 10\n−8 \nM\n−1\n, whereas the low affinity receptors FcγRII and FcγRIII generally bind at 10\n−6 \nand 10\n−5 \nrespectively. The extracellular domains of FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIIb are 96% identical, however FcγRIIIb does not have a intracellular signaling domain. Furthermore, whereas FcγRI, FcγRIIa/c, and FcγRIIIa are positive regulators of immune complex-triggered activation, characterized by having an intracellular domain that has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), FcγRIIb has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and is therefore inhibitory. Thus the former are referred to as activation receptors, and FcγRIIb is referred to as an inhibitory receptor. The receptors also differ in expression pattern and levels on different immune cells. Yet another level of complexity is the existence of a number of FcγR polymorphisms in the human proteome. A particularly relevant polymorphism with clinical significance is V158/F158 FcγRIIIa. Human IgG1 binds with greater affinity to the V158 allotype than to the F158 allotype. This difference in affinity, and presumably its effect on ADCC and/or ADCP, has been shown to be a significant determinant of the efficacy of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (Rituxan®, a registered trademark of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation). Patients with the V158 allotype respond favorably to rituximab treatment; however, patients with the lower affinity F158 allotype respond poorly (Cartron et al., 2002\n, Blood \n99:754-758). Approximately 10-20% of humans are V158/V158 homozygous, 45% are V158/F158 heterozygous, and 35-45% of humans are F158/F158 homozygous (Lehrnbecher et al., 1999\n, Blood \n94:4220-4232; Cartron et al., 2002\n, Blood \n99:754-758). Thus 80-90% of humans are poor responders, that is they have at least one allele of the F158 FcγRIIIa.\n\n\nAn overlapping but separate site on Fc, shown in \nFIG. 1\n, serves as the interface for the complement protein C1q. In the same way that Fc/FcγR binding mediates ADCC, Fc/C1q binding mediates complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). C1q forms a complex with the serine proteases C1r and C1s to form the C1 complex. C1q is capable of binding six antibodies, although binding to two IgGs is sufficient to activate the complement cascade. Similar to Fc interaction with FcγRs, different IgG subclasses have different affinity for C1q, with IgG1 and IgG3 typically binding substantially better to the FcγRs than IgG2 and IgG4 (Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65). There is currently no structure available for the Fc/C1q complex; however, mutagenesis studies have mapped the binding site on human IgG for C1q to a region involving residues D270, K322, K326, P329, and P331, and E333 (Idusogie et al., 2000\n, J Immunol \n164:4178-4184; Idusogie et al., 2001\n, J Immunol \n166:2571-2575).\n\n\nA site on Fc between the Cγ2 and Cγ3 domains, shown in \nFIG. 1\n, mediates interaction with the neonatal receptor FcRn, the binding of which recycles endocytosed antibody from the endosome back to the bloodstream (Raghavan et al., 1996\n, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol \n12:181-220; Ghetie et al., 2000\n, Annu Rev Immunol \n18:739-766). This process, coupled with preclusion of kidney filtration due to the large size of the full length molecule, results in favorable antibody serum half-lives ranging from one to three weeks. Binding of Fc to FcRn also plays a key role in antibody transport. The binding site for FcRn on Fc is also the site at which the bacterial proteins A and G bind. The tight binding by these proteins is typically exploited as a means to purify antibodies by employing protein A or protein G affinity chromatography during protein purification. Thus the fidelity of this region on Fc is important for both the clinical properties of antibodies and their purification. Available structures of the rat Fc/FcRn complex (Martin et al., 2001\n, Mol Cell \n7:867-877), and of the complexes of Fc with proteins A and G (Deisenhofer, 1981\n, Biochemistry \n20:2361-2370; Sauer-Eriksson et al., 1995\n, Structure \n3:265-278; Tashiro et al., 1995\n, Curr Opin Struct Biol \n5:471-481) provide insight into the interaction of Fc with these proteins.\n\n\nA key feature of the Fc region is the conserved N-linked glycosylation that occurs at N297, shown in \nFIG. 1\n. This carbohydrate, or oligosaccharide as it is sometimes referred, plays a critical structural and functional role for the antibody, and is one of the principle reasons that antibodies must be produced using mammalian expression systems. While not wanting to be limited to one theory, it is believed that the structural purpose of this carbohydrate may be to stabilize or solubilize Fc, determine a specific angle or level of flexibility between the Cγ3 and Cγ2 domains, keep the two Cγ2 domains from aggregating with one another across the central axis, or a combination of these. Efficient Fc binding to FcγR and C1q requires this modification, and alterations in the composition of the N297 carbohydrate or its elimination affect binding to these proteins (Umana et al., 1999\n, Nat Biotechnol \n17:176-180; Davies et al., 2001\n, Biotechnol Bioeng \n74:288-294; Mimura et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:45539-45547\n.; Radaev et al., \n2001\n, Biol Chem \n276:16478-16483; Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604; Shields et al., 2002\n, J Biol Chem \n277:26733-26740; Simmons et al., 2002\n, J Immunol Methods \n263:133-147). Yet the carbohydrate makes little if any specific contact with FcγRs (Radaev et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:16469-16477), indicating that the functional role of the N297 carbohydrate in mediating Fc/FcγR binding may be via the structural role it plays in determining the Fc conformation. This is supported by a collection of crystal structures of four different Fc glycoforms, which show that the composition of the oligosaccharide impacts the conformation of Cγ2 and as a result the Fc/FcγR interface (Krapp et al., 2003\n, J Mol Biol \n325:979-989).\n\n\nThe features of antibodies discussed above—specificity for target, ability to mediate immune effector mechanisms, and long half-life in serum—make antibodies powerful therapeutics. Monoclonal antibodies are used therapeutically for the treatment of a variety of conditions including cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. There are currently over ten antibody products on the market and hundreds in development. In addition to antibodies, an antibody-like protein that is finding an expanding role in research and therapy is the Fc fusion (Chamow et al., 1996\n, Trends Biotechnol \n14:52-60; Ashkenazi et al., 1997\n, Curr Opin Immunol \n9:195-200). An Fc fusion is a protein wherein one or more polypeptides is operably linked to Fc. An Fc fusion combines the Fc region of an antibody, and thus its favorable effector functions and pharmacokinetics, with the target-binding region of a receptor, ligand, or some other protein or protein domain. The role of the latter is to mediate target recognition, and thus it is functionally analogous to the antibody variable region. Because of the structural and functional overlap of Fc fusions with antibodies, the discussion on antibodies in the present invention extends directly to Fc fusions.\n\n\nDespite such widespread use, antibodies are not optimized for clinical use. Two significant deficiencies of antibodies are their suboptimal anticancer potency and their demanding production requirements. These deficiencies are addressed by the present invention\n\n\nThere are a number of possible mechanisms by which antibodies destroy tumor cells, including anti-proliferation via blockage of needed growth pathways, intracellular signaling leading to apoptosis, enhanced down regulation and/or turnover of receptors, CDC, ADCC, ADCP, and promotion of an adaptive immune response (Cragg et al., 1999\n, Curr Opin Immunol \n11:541-547; Glennie et al., 2000\n, Immunol Today \n21:403-410). Anti-tumor efficacy may be due to a combination of these mechanisms, and their relative importance in clinical therapy appears to be cancer dependent. Despite this arsenal of anti-tumor weapons, the potency of antibodies as anti-cancer agents is unsatisfactory, particularly given their high cost. Patient tumor response data show that monoclonal antibodies provide only a small improvement in therapeutic success over normal single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. For example, just half of all relapsed low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients respond to the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (McLaughlin et al., 1998\n, J Clin Oncol \n16:2825-2833). Of 166 clinical patients, 6% showed a complete response and 42% showed a partial response, with median response duration of approximately 12 months. Trastuzumab (Herceptin®, a registered trademark of Genentech), an anti-HER2/neu antibody for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, has less efficacy. The overall response rate using trastuzumab for the 222 patients tested was only 15%, with 8 complete and 26 partial responses and a median response duration and survival of 9 to 13 months (Cobleigh et al., 1999\n, J Clin Oncol \n17:2639-2648). Currently for anticancer therapy, any small improvement in mortality rate defines success. Thus there is a significant need to enhance the capacity of antibodies to destroy targeted cancer cells.\n\n\nA promising means for enhancing the anti-tumor potency of antibodies is via enhancement of their ability to mediate cytotoxic effector functions such as ADCC, ADCP, and CDC. The importance of FcγR-mediated effector functions for the anti-cancer activity of antibodies has been demonstrated in mice (Clynes et al., 1998\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n95:652-656; Clynes et al., 2000\n, Nat Med \n6:443-446), and the affinity of interaction between Fc and certain FcγRs correlates with targeted cytotoxicity in cell-based assays (Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604; Presta et al., 2002\n, Biochem Soc Trans \n30:487-490; Shields et al., 2002\n, J Biol Chem \n277:26733-26740). Additionally, a correlation has been observed between clinical efficacy in humans and their allotype of high (V158) or low (F158) affinity polymorphic forms of FcγRIIIa (Cartron et al., 2002\n, Blood \n99:754-758). Together these data suggest that an antibody with an Fc region optimized for binding to certain FcγRs may better mediate effector functions and thereby destroy cancer cells more effectively in patients. The balance between activating and inhibiting receptors is an important consideration, and optimal effector function may result from an Fc with enhanced affinity for activation receptors, for example FcγRI, FcγRIIa/c, and FcγRIIIa, yet reduced affinity for the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb. Furthermore, because FcγRs can mediate antigen uptake and processing by antigen presenting cells, enhanced Fc/FcγR affinity may also improve the capacity of antibody therapeutics to elicit an adaptive immune response.\n\n\nMutagenesis studies have been carried out on Fc towards various goals, with substitutions typically made to alanine (referred to as alanine scanning) or guided by sequence homology substitutions (Duncan et al., 1988\n, Nature \n332:563-564; Lund et al., 1991\n, J Immunol \n147:2657-2662; Lund et al., 1992\n, Mol Immunol \n29:53-59; Jefferis et al., 1995\n, Immunol Lett \n44:111-117; Lund et al., 1995\n, Faseb J \n9:115-119; Jefferis et al., 1996\n, Immunol Lett \n54:101-104; Lund et al., 1996\n, J Immunol \n157:4963-4969; Armour et al., 1999\n, Eur J Immunol \n29:2613-2624; Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604; Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821; U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,573; PCT WO 00/42072; PCT WO 99/58572). The majority of substitutions reduce or ablate binding with FcγRs. However some success has been achieved at obtaining Fc variants with higher FcγR affinity. (See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821, and PCT WO 00/42072). For example, Winter and colleagues substituted the human amino acid at position 235 of mouse IgG2b antibody (a glutamic acid to leucine mutation) that increased binding of the mouse antibody to human FcγRI by 100-fold (Duncan et al., 1988\n, Nature \n332:563-564) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821). Shields et al. used alanine scanning mutagenesis to map Fc residues important to FcγR binding, followed by substitution of select residues with non-alanine mutations (Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604; Presta et al., 2002\n, Biochem Soc Trans \n30:487-490) (PCT WO 00/42072). Several mutations disclosed in this study, including S298A, E333A, and K334A, show enhanced binding to the activating receptor FcγRIIIa and reduced binding to the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb. These mutations were combined to obtain double and triple mutation variants that show additive improvements in binding. The best variant disclosed in this study is a S298A/E333A/K334A triple mutant with approximately a 1.7-fold increase in binding to F158 FcγRIIIa, a 5-fold decrease in binding to FcγRIIb, and a 2.1-fold enhancement in ADCC.\n\n\nEnhanced affinity of Fc for FcγR has also been achieved using engineered glycoforms generated by expression of antibodies in engineered or variant cell lines (Umana et al., 1999\n, Nat Biotechnol \n17:176-180; Davies et al., 2001\n, Biotechnol Bioeng \n74:288-294; Shields et al., 2002\n, J Biol Chem \n277:26733-26740; Shinkawa et al., 2003\n, J Biol Chem \n278:3466-3473). This approach has generated substantial enhancements of the capacity of antibodies to bind FcγRIIIa and to mediate ADCC. Although there are practical limitations such as the growth efficiency of the expression strains under large scale production conditions, this approach for enhancing Fc/FcγR affinity and effector function is promising. Indeed, coupling of these alternate glycoform technologies with the Fc variants of the present invention may provide additive or synergistic effects for optimal effector function.\n\n\nAlthough there is a need for greater effector function, for some antibody therapeutics reduced or eliminated effector function may be desired. This is often the case for therapeutic antibodies whose mechanism of action involves blocking or antagonism but not killing of the cells bearing target antigen. In these cases depletion of target cells is undesirable and can be considered a side effect. For example, the ability of anti-CD4 antibodies to block CD4 receptors on T cells makes them effective anti-inflammatories, yet their ability to recruit FcγR receptors also directs immune attack against the target cells, resulting in T cell depletion (Reddy et al., 2000\n, J Immunol \n164:1925-1933). Effector function can also be a problem for radiolabeled antibodies, referred to as radioconjugates, and antibodies conjugated to toxins, referred to as immunotoxins. These drugs can be used to destroy cancer cells, but the recruitment of immune cells via Fc interaction with FcγRs brings healthy immune cells in proximity to the deadly payload (radiation or toxin), resulting in depletion of normal lymphoid tissue along with targeted cancer cells (Hutchins et al., 1995\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n92:11980-11984; White et al., 2001\n, Annu Rev Med \n52:125-145). This problem can potentially be circumvented by using IgG isotypes that poorly recruit complement or effector cells, for example IgG2 and IgG4. An alternate solution is to develop Fc variants that reduce or ablate binding (Alegre et al., 1994\n, Transplantation \n57:1537-1543; Hutchins et al., 1995\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A \n92:11980-11984; Armour et al., 1999\n, Eur J Immunol \n29:2613-2624; Reddy et al., 2000\n, J Immunol \n164:1925-1933; Xu et al., 2000\n, Cell Immunol \n200:16-26; Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604) (U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,551; U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,573; PCT WO 99/58572). A critical consideration for the reduction or elimination of effector function is that other important antibody properties not be perturbed. Fc variants should be engineered that not only ablate binding to FcγRs and/or C1q, but also maintain antibody stability, solubility, and structural integrity, as well as ability to interact with other important Fc ligands such as FcRn and proteins A and G.\n\n\nThe present invention addresses another major shortcoming of antibodies, namely their demanding production requirements (Garber, 2001\n, Nat Biotechnol \n19:184-185; Dove, 2002\n, Nat Biotechnol \n20:777-779). Antibodies must be expressed in mammalian cells, and the currently marketed antibodies together with other high-demand biotherapeutics consume essentially all of the available manufacturing capacity. With hundreds of biologics in development, the majority of which are antibodies, there is an urgent need for more efficient and cheaper methods of production. The downstream effects of insufficient antibody manufacturing capacity are three-fold. First, it dramatically raises the cost of goods to the producer, a cost that is passed on to the patient. Second, it hinders industrial production of approved antibody products, limiting availability of high demand therapeutics to patients. Finally, because clinical trials require large amounts of a protein that is not yet profitable, the insufficient supply impedes progress of the growing antibody pipeline to market.\n\n\nAlternative production methods have been explored in attempts at alleviating this problem. Transgenic plants and animals are being pursued as potentially cheaper and higher capacity production systems (Chadd et al., 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n12:188-194). Such expression systems, however, can generate glycosylation patterns significantly different from human glycoproteins. This may result in reduced or even lack of effector function because, as discussed above, the carbohydrate structure can significantly impact FcγR and complement binding. A potentially greater problem with nonhuman glycoforms may be immunogenicity; carbohydrates are a key source of antigenicity for the immune system, and the presence of nonhuman glycoforms has a significant chance of eliciting antibodies that neutralize the therapeutic, or worse cause adverse immune reactions. Thus the efficacy and safety of antibodies produced by transgenic plants and animals remains uncertain. Bacterial expression is another attractive solution to the antibody production problem. Expression in bacteria, for example \nE. coli\n, provides a cost-effective and high capacity method for producing proteins. For complex proteins such as antibodies there are a number of obstacles to bacterial expression, including folding and assembly of these complex molecules, proper disulfide formation, and solubility, stability, and functionality in the absence of glycosylation because proteins expressed in bacteria are not glycosylated. Full length unglycosylated antibodies that bind antigen have been successfully expressed in \nE. coli \n(Simmons et al., 2002\n, J Immunol Methods \n263:133-147), and thus, folding, assembly, and proper disulfide formation of bacterially expressed antibodies are possible in the absence of the eukaryotic chaperone machinery. However the ultimate utility of bacterially expressed antibodies as therapeutics remains hindered by the lack of glycosylation, which results in lack effector function and may result in poor stability and solubility. This will likely be more problematic for formulation at the high concentrations for the prolonged periods demanded by clinical use.\n\n\nAn aglycosylated Fc with favorable solution properties and the capacity to mediate effector functions would be significantly enabling for the alternate production methods described above. By overcoming the structural and functional shortcomings of aglycosylated Fc, antibodies can be produced in bacteria and transgenic plants and animals with reduced risk of immunogenicity, and with effector function for clinical applications in which cytotoxicity is desired such as cancer. The present invention describes the utilization of protein engineering methods to develop stable, soluble Fc variants with effector function. Currently, such Fc variants do not exist in the art.\n\n\nIn summary, there is a need for antibodies with enhanced therapeutic properties. Engineering of optimized or enhanced Fc variants is a promising approach to meeting this need. Yet a substantial obstacle to engineering Fc variants with the desired properties is the difficulty in predicting what amino acid modifications, out of the enormous number of possibilities, will achieve the desired goals, coupled with the inefficient production and screening methods for antibodies. Indeed one of the principle reasons for the incomplete success of the prior art is that approaches to Fc engineering have thus far involved hit-or-miss methods such as alanine scans or production of glycoforms using different expression strains. In these studies, the Fc modifications that were made were fully or partly random in hopes of obtaining variants with favorable properties. The present invention provides a variety of engineering methods, many of which are based on more sophisticated and efficient techniques, which may be used to overcome these obstacles in order to develop Fc variants that are optimized for the desired properties. The described engineering methods provide design strategies to guide Fc modification, computational screening methods to design favorable Fc variants, library generation approaches for determining promising variants for experimental investigation, and an array of experimental production and screening methods for determining the Fc variants with favorable properties.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides Fc variants that are optimized for a number of therapeutically relevant properties. These Fc variants are generally contained within a variant protein, that preferably comprises an antibody or a Fc fusion protein.\n\n\nIt is an object of the present invention to provide novel Fc positions at which amino acid modifications may be made to generate optimized Fc variants. Said Fc positions include 230, 240, 244, 245, 247, 262, 263, 266, 273, 275, 299, 302, 313, 323, 325, 328, and 332, wherein the numbering of the residues in the Fc region is that of the EU index as in Kabat. The present invention describes any amino acid modification at any of said novel Fc positions in order to generate an optimized Fc variant.\n\n\nIt is a further object of the present invention to provide Fc variants that have been screened computationally. A computationally screened Fc variant is one that is predicted by the computational screening calculations described herein as having a significantly greater potential than random for being optimized for a desired property. In this way, computational screening serves as a prelude to or surrogate for experimental screening, and thus said computationally screened Fc variants are considered novel.\n\n\nIt is a further object of the present invention to provide Fc variants that have been characterized using one or more of the experimental methods described herein. In one embodiment, said Fc variants comprise at least one amino acid substitution at a position selected from the group consisting of: 230, 233, 234, 235, 239, 240, 241, 243, 244, 245, 247, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 269, 270, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 278, 283, 296, 297, 298, 299, 302, 313, 318, 320, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, and 335, wherein the numbering of the residues in the Fc region is that of the EU index as in Kabat.

Antibody structure and function. Shown is a model of a full length human IgG1 antibody, modeled using a humanized Fab structure from pdb accession code 1CE1 (James et al., 1999\n, J Mol Biol \n289:293-301) and a human IgG1 Fc structure from \npdb accession code\n 1 DN2 (DeLano et al., 2000\n, Science \n287:1279-1283). The flexible hinge that links the Fab and Fc regions is not shown. IgG1 is a homodimer of heterodimers, made up of two light chains and two heavy chains. The Ig domains that comprise the antibody are labeled, and include V\nL \nand C\nL \nfor the light chain, and V\nH\n, Cgamma1 (Cγ1), Cgamma2 (Cγ2), and Cgamma3 (Cγ3) for the heavy chain. The Fc region is labeled. Binding sites for relevant proteins are labeled, including the antigen binding site in the variable region, and the binding sites for FcγRs, FcRn, C1q, and proteins A and G in the Fc region.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n. The Fc/FcγRIIIb complex structure 1IIS. Fc is shown as a gray ribbon diagram, and FcγRIIIb is shown as a black ribbon. The N297 carbohydrate is shown as black sticks.\n\n\n \nFIG. 3\n. The amino acid sequence of the heavy chain of the antibody alemtuzumab (Campath®, a registered trademark of IIex Pharmaceuticals LP), illustrating positions numbered sequentially (2 lines above the amino acid sequence) and positions numbered according to the EU index as in Kabat (2 lines below the amino acid sequence. The approximate beginnings of Ig domains VH1, Cγ1, the hinge, Cγ2, and Cγ3 are also labeled above the sequential numbering. Polymorphisms have been observed at a number of Fc positions, including but not limited to \nKabat\n 270, 272, 312, 315, 356, and 358, and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the prior art may exist.\n\n\n \nFIG. 4\n. Experimental library residues mapped onto the Fc/FcγRIIIb complex structure 1IIS. Fc is shown as a gray ribbon diagram, and FcγRIIIb is shown as a black ribbon. Experimental library residues are shown in black, the N297 carbohydrate is shown in grey.\n\n\n \nFIG. 5\n. The human IgG1 Fc sequence showing positions relevant to the design of the Fc variant experimental library. The sequence includes the hinge region, domain Cγ2, and domain Cγ3. Residue numbers are according to the EU index as in Kabat. Positions relevant to the experimental library are underlined. Because of observed polymorphic mutations at a number of Fc positions, slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the literature may exist.\n\n\n \nFIG. 6\n. Expression of Fc variant and wild type (WT) proteins of alemtuzumab in 293T cells. Plasmids containing alemtuzumab heavy chain genes (WT or variants) were co-transfected with plasmid containing the alemtuzumab light chain gene. Media were harvested 5 days after transfection. For each transfected sample, 10 ul medium was loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel for Western analysis. The probe for Western was peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG (Jackson Immuno-Research, catalog #109-035-088). WT: wild type alemtuzumab; 1-10: alemtuzumab variants. H and L indicate antibody heavy chain and light chain, respectively.\n\n\n \nFIG. 7\n. Purification of alemtuzumab using protein A chromatography. WT alemtuzumab proteins was expressed in 293T cells and the media was harvested 5 days after transfection. The media were diluted 1:1 with PBS and purified with protein A (Pierce, Catalog #20334). O: original sample before purification; FT: flow through; E: elution; C: concentrated final sample. The left picture shows a Simple Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel, and the right shows a western blot labeled using peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG.\n\n\n \nFIG. 8\n. Production of deglycosylated antibodies. Wild type and variants of alemtuzumab were expressed in 293T cells and purified with protein A chromatography. Antibodies were incubated with peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGase F) at 37° C. for 24 h. For each antibody, a mock treated sample (-PNGase F) was done in parallel. WT: wild-type alemtuzumab; #15, #16, #17, #18, #22: alemtuzumab variants F241E/F243R/V262E/V264R, F241E/F243Q/V262T/V264E, F241R/F243Q/V262T/V264R, F241E/F243Y/V262T/V264R, and I332E respectively. The faster migration of the PNGase F treated versus the mock treated samples represents the deglycosylated heavy chains.\n\n\n \nFIG. 9\n. Alemtuzumab expressed from 293T cells binds its antigen. The antigenic CD52 peptide, fused to GST, was expressed in \nE. coli \nBL21 (DE3) under IPTG induction. Both uninduced and induced samples were run on a SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to PVDF membrane. For western analysis, either alemtuzumab from Sotec (α-CD52, Sotec) (final concentration 2.5 ng/ul) or media of transfected 293T cells (Campath, Xencor) (final alemtuzumab concentration approximately 0.1-0.2 ng/ul) were used as primary antibody, and peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG was used as secondary antibody. M: pre-stained marker; U: un-induced sample for GST-CD52; I: induced sample for GST-CD52.\n\n\n \nFIG. 10\n. Expression and purification of extracellular region of human V158 FcγRIIIa.

These improved anti-CD20 antibody sequences may also comprise a substitution Z\n1 \nand/or Z\n2\n. These positions are numbered according to the EU index as in Kabat, and thus do not correspond to the sequential order in the sequence.\n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn order that the invention may be more completely understood, several definitions are set forth below. Such definitions are meant to encompass grammatical equivalents.\n\n\nBy “ADCC” or “antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity” as used herein is meant the cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell.\n\n\nBy “ADCP” or antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis as used herein is meant the cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell.\n\n\nBy “amino acid modification” herein is meant an amino acid substitution, insertion, and/or deletion in a polypeptide sequence. The preferred amino acid modification herein is a substitution. By “amino acid substitution” or “substitution” herein is meant the replacement of an amino acid at a particular position in a parent polypeptide sequence with another amino acid. For example, the substitution I332E refers to a variant polypeptide, in this case an Fc variant, in which the isoleucine at position 332 is replaced with a glutamic acid.\n\n\nBy “antibody” herein is meant a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by all or part of the recognized immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes, for example in humans, include the kappa (κ), lambda (λ), and heavy chain genetic loci, which together comprise the myriad variable region genes, and the constant region genes mu (ν), delta (δ), gamma (γ), sigma (ε), and alpha (α) which encode the IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, and IgA isotypes respectively. Antibody herein is meant to include full length antibodies and antibody fragments, and may refer to a natural antibody from any organism, an engineered antibody, or an antibody generated recombinantly for experimental, therapeutic, or other purposes as further defined below. The term “antibody” includes antibody fragments, as are known in the art, such as Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv, scFv, or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies, either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or those synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA technologies. Particularly preferred are full length antibodies that comprise Fc variants as described herein. The term “antibody” comprises monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Antibodies can be antagonists, agonists, neutralizing, inhibitory, or stimulatory.\n\n\nThe antibodies of the present invention may be nonhuman, chimeric, humanized, or fully human. For a description of the concepts of chimeric and humanized antibodies see Clark et al., 2000 and references cited therein (Clark, 2000\n, Immunol Today \n21:397-402). Chimeric antibodies comprise the variable region of a nonhuman antibody, for example VH and VL domains of mouse or rat origin, operably linked to the constant region of a human antibody (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the present invention are humanized. By “humanized” antibody as used herein is meant an antibody comprising a human framework region (FR) and one or more complementarity determining regions (CDR's) from a non-human (usually mouse or rat) antibody. The non-human antibody providing the CDR's is called the “donor” and the human immunoglobulin providing the framework is called the “acceptor”. Humanization relies principally on the grafting of donor CDRs onto acceptor (human) VL and VH frameworks (Winter U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539). This strategy is referred to as “CDR grafting”. “Backmutation” of selected acceptor framework residues to the corresponding donor residues is often required to regain affinity that is lost in the initial grafted construct (U.S. Pat. No. 5,530,101; U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,761; U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762; U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,370; U.S. Pat. No. 5,859,205; U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337; U.S. Pat. No. 6,054,297; U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,213). The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region, typically that of a human immunoglobulin, and thus will typically comprise a human Fc region. Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art, and can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al., 1986\n, Nature \n321:522-525; Riechmann et al., 1988\n, Nature \n332:323-329; Verhoeyen et al., 1988\n, Science, \n239:1534-1536). Additional examples of humanized murine monoclonal antibodies are also known in the art, for example antibodies binding human protein C(O'Connor et al., 1998\n, Protein Eng \n11:321-8), \ninterleukin\n 2 receptor (Queen et al., 1989\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA \n86:10029-33), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Carter et al., 1992\n, Proc Nat Acad Sci USA \n89:4285-9). In an alternate embodiment, the antibodies of the present invention may be fully human, that is the sequences of the antibodies are completely or substantially human. A number of methods are known in the art for generating fully human antibodies, including the use of transgenic mice (Bruggemann et al., 1997\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n8:455-458) or human antibody libraries coupled with selection methods (Griffiths et al., 1998\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n9:102-108).\n\n\nSpecifically included within the definition of “antibody” are aglycosylated antibodies. By “aglycosylated antibody” as used herein is meant an antibody that lacks carbohydrate attached at position 297 of the Fc region, wherein numbering is according to the EU system as in Kabat. The aglycosylated antibody may be a deglycosylated antibody, that is an antibody for which the Fc carbohydrate has been removed, for example chemically or enzymatically. Alternatively, the aglycosylated antibody may be a nonglycosylated or unglycosylated antibody, that is an antibody that was expressed without Fc carbohydrate, for example by mutation of one or residues that encode the glycosylation pattern or by expression in an organism that does not attach carbohydrates to proteins, for example bacteria.\n\n\nSpecifically included within the definition of “antibody” are full-length antibodies that contain an Fc variant portion. By “full length antibody” herein is meant the structure that constitutes the natural biological form of an antibody, including variable and constant regions. For example, in most mammals, including humans and mice, the full length antibody of the IgG class is a tetramer and consists of two identical pairs of two immunoglobulin chains, each pair having one light and one heavy chain, each light chain comprising immunoglobulin domains V\nL \nand C\nL\n, and each heavy chain comprising immunoglobulin domains V\nH\n, Cγ1, Cγ2, and Cγ3. In some mammals, for example in camels and llamas, IgG antibodies may consist of only two heavy chains, each heavy chain comprising a variable domain attached to the Fc region. By “IgG” as used herein is meant a polypeptide belonging to the class of antibodies that are substantially encoded by a recognized immunoglobulin gamma gene. In humans this class comprises IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. In mice this class comprises IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3.\n\n\nBy “amino acid” and “amino acid identity” as used herein is meant one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids or any non-natural analogues that may be present at a specific, defined position. By “protein” herein is meant at least two covalently attached amino acids, which includes proteins, polypeptides, oligopeptides and peptides. The protein may be made up of naturally occurring amino acids and peptide bonds, or synthetic peptidomimetic structures, i.e. “analogs”, such as peptoids (see Simon et al., 1992\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n89(20):9367) particularly when LC peptides are to be administered to a patient. Thus “amino acid”, or “peptide residue”, as used herein means both naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids. For example, homophenylalanine, citrulline and noreleucine are considered amino acids for the purposes of the invention. “Amino acid” also includes imino acid residues such as proline and hydroxyproline. The side chain may be in either the (R) or the (S) configuration. In the preferred embodiment, the amino acids are in the (S) or L-configuration. If non-naturally occurring side chains are used, non-amino acid substituents may be used, for example to prevent or retard in vivo degradation.\n\n\nBy “computational screening method” herein is meant any method for designing one or more mutations in a protein, wherein said method utilizes a computer to evaluate the energies of the interactions of potential amino acid side chain substitutions with each other and/or with the rest of the protein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, evaluation of energies, referred to as energy calculation, refers to some method of scoring one or more amino acid modifications. Said method may involve a physical or chemical energy term, or may involve knowledge-, statistical-, sequence-based energy terms, and the like. The calculations that compose a computational screening method are herein referred to as “computational screening calculations”.\n\n\nBy “effector function” as used herein is meant a biochemical event that results from the interaction of an antibody Fc region with an Fc receptor or ligand. Effector functions include but are not limited to ADCC, ADCP, and CDC. By “effector cell” as used herein is meant a cell of the immune system that expresses one or more Fc receptors and mediates one or more effector functions. Effector cells include but are not limited to monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, eosinophils, mast cells, platelets, B cells, large granular lymphocytes, Langerhans' cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and γγT cells, and may be from any organism including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. By “library” herein is meant a set of Fc variants in any form, including but not limited to a list of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, a list of nucleic acid or amino acid substitutions at variable positions, a physical library comprising nucleic acids that encode the library sequences, or a physical library comprising the Fc variant proteins, either in purified or unpurified form.\n\n\nBy “Fc”, “Fc region”, FC polypeptide”, etc. as used herein is meant an antibody as defined herein that includes the polypeptides comprising the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA, IgD, and IgG, and the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM, and the flexible hinge N-terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM Fc may include the J chain. For IgG, as illustrated in \nFIG. 1\n, Fc comprises immunoglobulin domains Cgamma2 and Cgamma3 (Cγ2 and Cγ3) and the hinge between Cgamma1 (Cγ1) and Cgamma2 (Cγ2). Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to comprise residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl-terminus, wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. Fc may refer to this region in isolation, or this region in the context of an antibody, antibody fragment, or Fc fusion. An Fc may be an antibody, Fc fusion, or an protein or protein domain that comprises Fc. Particularly preferred are Fc variants, which are non-naturally occurring variants of an Fc.\n\n\nBy “Fc fusion” as used herein is meant a protein wherein one or more polypeptides is operably linked to an Fc region or a derivative thereof. Fc fusion is herein meant to be synonymous with the terms “immunoadhesin”, “Ig fusion”, “Ig chimera”, and “receptor globulin” (sometimes with dashes) as used in the prior art (Chamow et al., 1996\n, Trends Biotechnol \n14:52-60; Ashkenazi et al., 1997\n, Curr Opin Immunol \n9:195-200). An Fc fusion combines the Fc region of an immunoglobulin with a fusion partner, which in general can be any protein or small molecule. The role of the non-Fc part of an Fc fusion, i.e. the fusion partner, is to mediate target binding, and thus it is functionally analogous to the variable regions of an antibody. Virtually any protein or small molecule may be linked to Fc to generate an Fc fusion. Protein fusion partners may include, but are not limited to, the target-binding region of a receptor, an adhesion molecule, a ligand, an enzyme, a cytokine, a chemokine, or some other protein or protein domain. Small molecule fusion partners may include any therapeutic agent that directs the Fc fusion to a therapeutic target. Such targets may be any molecule, preferrably an extracellular receptor, that is implicated in disease. Two families of surface receptors that are targets of a number of approved small molecule drugs are G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), and ion channels, including K+, Na+, Ca+ channels. Nearly 70% of all drugs currently marketed worldwide target GPCRs. Thus the Fc variants of the present invention may be fused to a small molecule that targets, for example, one or more GABA receptors, purinergic receptors, adrenergic receptors, histaminergic receptors, opiod receptors, chemokine receptors, glutamate receptors, nicotinic receptors, the 5HT (serotonin) receptor, and estrogen receptors. A fusion partner may be a small-molecule mimetic of a protein that targets a therapeutically useful target. Specific examples of particular drugs that may serve as Fc fusion partners can be found in L. S. Goodman et al., Eds., \nGoodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics \n(McGraw-Hill, New York, ed. 9, 1996). Fusion partners include not only small molecules and proteins that bind known targets for existing drugs, but orphan receptors that do not yet exist as drug targets. The completion of the genome and proteome projects are proving to be a driving force in drug discovery, and these projects have yielded a trove of orphan receptors. There is enormous potential to validate these new molecules as drug targets, and develop protein and small molecule therapeutics that target them. Such protein and small molecule therapeutics are contemplated as Fc fusion partners that employ the Fc variants of the present invention. A variety of linkers, defined and described below, may be used to covalently link Fc to a fusion partner to generate an Fc fusion.\n\n\nBy “Fc gamma receptor” or “FcγR” as used herein is meant any member of the family of proteins that bind the IgG antibody Fc region and are substantially encoded by the FcγR genes. In humans this family includes but is not limited to FcγRI (CD64), including isoforms FcγRIa, FcγRIb, and FcγRIc; FcγRII (CD32), including isoforms FcγRIIa (including allotypes H131 and R131), FcγRIIb (including FcγRIIb-1 and FcγRIIb-2), and FcγRIIc; and FcγRIII (CD16), including isoforms FcγRIIIa (including allotypes V158 and F158) and FcγRIIIb (including allotypes FcγRIIIb-NA1 and FcγRIIIb-NA2) (Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65), as well as any undiscovered human FcγRs or FcγR isoforms or allotypes. An FcγR may be from any organism, including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. Mouse FcγRs include but are not limited to FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32), FcγRIII (CD16), and FcγRIII-2 (CD16-2), as well as any undiscovered mouse FcγRs or FcγR isoforms or allotypes.\n\n\nBy “Fc ligand” as used herein is meant a molecule, preferably a polypeptide, from any organism that binds to the Fc region of an antibody to form an Fc-ligand complex. Fc ligands include but are not limited to FcγRs, FcγRs, FcγRs, FcRn, C1q, C3, mannan binding lectin, mannose receptor, staphylococcal protein A, streptococcal protein G, and viral FcγR. Fc ligands also include Fc receptor homologs (FcRH), which are a family of Fc receptors that are homologous to the FcγRs (Davis et al., 2002\n, Immunological Reviews \n190:123-136). Fc ligands may include undiscovered molecules that bind Fc.\n\n\nBy “IgG” as used herein is meant a polypeptide belonging to the class of antibodies that are substantially encoded by a recognized immunoglobulin gamma gene. In humans this class comprises IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. In mice this class comprises IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3. By “immunoglobulin (Ig)” herein is meant a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes. Immunoglobulins include but are not limited to antibodies. Immunoglobulins may have a number of structural forms, including but not limited to full length antibodies, antibody fragments, and individual immunoglobulin domains. By “immunoglobulin (Ig) domain” herein is meant a region of an immunoglobulin that exists as a distinct structural entity as ascertained by one skilled in the art of protein structure. Ig domains typically have a characteristic □-sandwich folding topology. The known Ig domains in the IgG class of antibodies are V\nH\n, Cγ1, Cγ2, Cγ3, V\nL\n, and C\nL\n.\n\n\nBy “parent polypeptide” or “precursor polypeptide” (including Fc parent or precursors) as used herein is meant a polypeptide that is subsequently modified to generate a variant. Said parent polypeptide may be a naturally occurring polypeptide, or a variant or engineered version of a naturally occurring polypeptide. Parent polypeptide may refer to the polypeptide itself, compositions that comprise the parent polypeptide, or the amino acid sequence that encodes it. Accordingly, by “parent Fc polypeptide” as used herein is meant an unmodified Fc polypeptide that is modified to generate a variant, and by “parent antibody” as used herein is meant an unmodified antibody that is modified to generate a variant antibody.\n\n\nAs outlined above, certain positions of the Fc molecule can be altered. By “position” as used herein is meant a location in the sequence of a protein. Positions may be numbered sequentially, or according to an established format, for example the EU index as in Kabat. For example, position 297 is a position in the human antibody IgG1. Corresponding positions are determined as outlined above, generally through alignment with other parent sequences.\n\n\nBy “residue” as used herein is meant a position in a protein and its associated amino acid identity. For example, Asparagine 297 (also referred to as Asn297, also referred to as N297) is a residue in the human antibody IgG1.\n\n\nBy “target antigen” as used herein is meant the molecule that is bound specifically by the variable region of a given antibody. A target antigen may be a protein, carbohydrate, lipid, or other chemical compound.\n\n\nBy “target cell” as used herein is meant a cell that expresses a target antigen.\n\n\nBy “variable region” as used herein is meant the region of an immunoglobulin that comprises one or more Ig domains substantially encoded by any of the Vκ, Vλ, and/or V\nH \ngenes that make up the kappa, lambda, and heavy chain immunoglobulin genetic loci respectively.\n\n\nBy “variant polypepide” as used herein is meant a polypeptide sequence that differs from that of a parent polypeptide sequence by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. Variant polypeptide may refer to the polypeptide itself, a composition comprising the polypeptide, or the amino sequence that encodes it. Preferably, the variant polypeptide has at least one amino acid modification compared to the parent polypeptide, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid modifications, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid modifications compared to the parent. The variant polypeptide sequence herein will preferably possess at least about 80% homology with a parent polypeptide sequence, and most preferably at least about 90% homology, more preferably at least about 95% homology. Accordingly, by “Fc variant” as used herein is meant an Fc sequence that differs from that of a parent Fc sequence by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. An Fc variant may only encompass an Fc region, or may exist in the context of an antibody, Fc fusion, or other polypeptide that is substantially encoded by Fc. Fc variant may refer to the Fc polypeptide itself, compositions comprising the Fc variant polypeptide, or the amino acid sequence that encodes it. In a preferred embodiment, the variant proteins of the invention comprise an Fc variant, as described herein, and as such, may comprise an antibody (and the corresponding derivatives) with the Fc variant, or an Fc fusion protein that comprises the Fc variant. In addition, in some cases, the Fc is a variant as compared to a wild-type Fc, or to a “parent” variant.\n\n\nFor all positions discussed in the present invention, numbering of an immunoglobulin heavy chain is according to the EU index (Kabat et al., 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., United States Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). The “EU index as in Kabat” refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be optimized for a variety of properties. Properties that may be optimized include but are not limited to enhanced or reduced affinity for an FcγR. In a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to possess enhanced affinity for a human activating FcγR, preferably FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIc, FcγRIIIa, and FcγRIIIb, most preferably FcγRIIa. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the Fc variants are optimized to possess reduced affinity for the human inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb. These preferred embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced therapeutic properties in humans, for example enhanced effector function and greater anti-cancer potency. In an alternate embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to have reduced or ablated affinity for a human FcγR, including but not limited to FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIc, FcγRIIa, and FcγRIIIb. These embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced therapeutic properties in humans, for example reduced effector function and reduced toxicity. Preferred embodiments comprise optimization of Fc binding to a human FcγR, however in alternate embodiments the Fc variants of the present invention possess enhanced or reduced affinity for FcγRs from nonhuman organisms, including but not limited to mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. Fc variants that are optimized for binding to a nonhuman FcγR may find use in experimentation. For example, mouse models are available for a variety of diseases that enable testing of properties such as efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics for a given drug candidate. As is known in the art, cancer cells can be grafted or injected into mice to mimic a human cancer, a process referred to as xenografting. Testing of antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise Fc variants that are optimized for one or more mouse FcγRs, may provide valuable information with regard to the efficacy of the antibody or Fc fusion, its mechanism of action, and the like. The Fc variants of the present invention may also be optimized for enhanced functionality and/or solution properties in aglycosylated form. In a preferred embodiment, the aglycosylated Fc variants of the present invention bind an Fc ligand with greater affinity than the aglycosylated form of the parent Fc polypeptide. Said Fc ligands include but are not limited to FcγRs, C1q, FcRn, and proteins A and G, and may be from any source including but not limited to human, mouse, rat, rabbit, or monkey, preferably human. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the Fc variants are optimized to be more stable and/or more soluble than the aglycosylated form of the parent Fc polypeptide. An Fc variant that is engineered or predicted to display any of the aforementioned optimized properties is herein referred to as an “optimized Fc variant”.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be derived from parent Fc polypeptides that are themselves from a wide range of sources. The parent Fc polypeptide may be substantially encoded by one or more Fc genes from any organism, including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, camels, llamas, dromedaries, monkeys, preferably mammals and most preferably humans and mice. In a preferred embodiment, the parent Fc polypeptide composes an antibody, referred to as the parent antibody. The parent antibody may be fully human, obtained for example using transgenic mice (Bruggemann et al., 1997\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n8:455-458) or human antibody libraries coupled with selection methods (Griffiths et al., 1998\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n9:102-108). The parent antibody need not be naturally occurring. For example, the parent antibody may be an engineered antibody, including but not limited to chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies (Clark, 2000\n, Immunol Today \n21:397-402). The parent antibody may be an engineered variant of an antibody that is substantially encoded by one or more natural antibody genes. In one embodiment, the parent antibody has been affinity matured, as is known in the art. Alternatively, the antibody has been modified in some other way, for example as described in U.S. Ser. No. 10/339,788, filed on Mar. 3, 2003.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes belonging to any of the antibody classes. In a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention find use in antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise sequences belonging to the IgG class of antibodies, including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4. In an alternate embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention find use in antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise sequences belonging to the IgA (including subclasses IgA1 and IgA2), IgD, IgE, IgG, or IgM classes of antibodies. The Fc variants of the present invention may comprise more than one protein chain. That is, the present invention may find use in an antibody or Fc fusion that is a monomer or an oligomer, including a homo- or hetero-oligomer.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are based on human sequences, and thus human sequences are used as the “base” sequences, against which other sequences, such as rat, mouse, and monkey sequences are compared. In order to establish homology to primary sequence or structure, the amino acid sequence of a precursor or parent Fc polypeptide is directly compared to the human Fc sequence outlined herein. After aligning the sequences, using one or more of the homology alignment programs known in the art (for example using conserved residues as between species), allowing for necessary insertions and deletions in order to maintain alignment (i.e., avoiding the elimination of conserved residues through arbitrary deletion and insertion), the residues equivalent to particular amino acids in the primary sequence of human Fc are defined. Alignment of conserved residues preferably should conserve 100% of such residues. However, alignment of greater than 75% or as little as 50% of conserved residues is also adequate to define equivalent residues (sometimes referred to as “corresponding residues”). Equivalent residues may also be defined by determining homology at the level of tertiary structure for an Fc polypeptide whose tertiary structure has been determined. Equivalent residues are defined as those for which the atomic coordinates of two or more of the main chain atoms of a particular amino acid residue of the parent or precursor (N on N, CA on CA, C on C and O on O) are within 0.13 nm and preferably 0.1 nm after alignment. Alignment is achieved after the best model has been oriented and positioned to give the maximum overlap of atomic coordinates of non-hydrogen protein atoms of the Fc polypeptide.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other Fc modifications, including but not limited to modifications that alter effector function or interaction with one or more Fc ligands. Such combination may provide additive, synergistic, or novel properties in antibodies or Fc fusions. In one embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other known Fc variants (Duncan et al., 1988\n, Nature \n332:563-564; Lund et al., 1991\n, J Immunol \n147:2657-2662; Lund et al., 1992\n, Mol Immunol \n29:53-59; Alegre et al., 1994\n, Transplantation \n57:1537-1543; Hutchins et al., 1995\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n92:11980-11984; Jefferis et al., 1995\n, Immunol Lett \n44:111-117; Lund et al., 1995\n, Faseb J \n9:115-119; Jefferis et al., 1996\n, Immunol Lett \n54:101-104; Lund et al., 1996\n, J Immunol \n157:4963-4969; Armour et al., 1999\n, Eur J Immunol \n29:2613-2624; Idusogie et al., 2000\n, J Immunol \n164:4178-4184; Reddy et al., 2000\n, J Immunol \n164:1925-1933; Xu et al., 2000\n, Cell Immunol \n200:16-26; Idusogie et al., 2001\n, J Immunol \n166:2571-2575; Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604; Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65; Presta et al., 2002\n, Biochem Soc Trans \n30:487-490; Hinton et al., 2004\n, J Biol Chem \n279:6213-6216) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821; U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,573; U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,551; PCT WO 00/42072; PCT WO 99/58572; US 2004/0002587 A1). In an alternate embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention are incorporated into an antibody or Fc fusion that comprises one or more engineered glycoforms. By “engineered glycoform” as used herein is meant a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to an Fc polypeptide, wherein said carbohydrate composition differs chemically from that of a parent Fc polypeptide. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to enhancing or reducing effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by a variety of methods known in the art (Umana et al., 1999\n, Nat Biotechnol \n17:176-180; Davies et al., 2001\n, Biotechnol Bioeng \n74:288-294; Shields et al., 2002\n, J Biol Chem \n277:26733-26740; Shinkawa et al., 2003\n, J Biol Chem \n278:3466-3473); (U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,684; U.S. Ser. No. 10/277,370; U.S. Ser. No. 10/113,929; PCT WO 00/61739A1; PCT WO 01/29246A1; PCT WO 02/31140A1; PCT WO 02/30954A1); (Potelligent™ technology [Biowa, Inc., Princeton, N.J.]; GlycoMAb™ glycosylation engineering technology [GLYCART biotechnology AG, Zurich, Switzerland]). Many of these techniques are based on controlling the level of fucosylated and/or bisecting oligosaccharides that are covalently attached to the Fc region, for example by expressing an Fc polypeptide in various organisms or cell lines, engineered or otherwise (for example Lec-13 CHO cells or rat hybridoma YB2/0 cells), by regulating enzymes involved in the glycosylation pathway (for example FUT8 [α1,6-fucosyltranserase] and/or β1-4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III [GnTIII]), or by modifying carbohydrate(s) after the Fc polypeptide has been expressed. Engineered glycoform typically refers to the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide; thus an Fc polypeptide, for example an antibody or Fc fusion, may comprise an engineered glycoform. Alternatively, engineered glycoform may refer to the Fc polypeptide that comprises the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide. Thus combinations of the Fc variants of the present invention with other Fc modifications, as well as undiscovered Fc modifications, are contemplated with the goal of generating novel antibodies or Fc fusions with optimized properties.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody. By “antibody of the present invention” as used herein is meant an antibody that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention. The present invention may, in fact, find use in any protein that comprises Fc, and thus application of the Fc variants of the present invention is not limited to antibodies. The Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an Fc fusion. By “Fc fusion of the present invention” as used herein refers to an Fc fusion that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention. Fc fusions may comprise an Fc variant of the present invention operably linked to a cytokine, soluble receptor domain, adhesion molecule, ligand, enzyme, peptide, or other protein or protein domain, and include but are not limited to Fc fusions described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,725; U.S. Pat. No. 6,018,026; U.S. Pat. No. 6,291,212; U.S. Pat. No. 6,291,646; U.S. Pat. No. 6,300,099; U.S. Pat. No. 6,323,323; PCT WO 00/24782; and in (Chamow et al., 1996\n, Trends Biotechnol \n14:52-60; Ashkenazi et al., 1997\n, Curr Opin Immunol \n9:195-200).\n\n\nVirtually any antigen may be targeted by the antibodies and fusions of the present invention, including but not limited to the following list of proteins, subunits, domains, motifs, and epitopes belonging to the following list of proteins: CD2; CD3, CD3E, CD4, CD11, CD11a, CD14, CD16, CD18, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD28, CD29, CD30, CD32, CD33 (p67 protein), CD38, CD40, CD40L, CD52, CD54, CD56, CD80, CD147, GD3, IL-1, IL-1R, IL-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-6R, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-23, interferon alpha, interferon beta, interferon gamma; TNF-alpha, TNFbeta2, TNFc, TNFalphabeta, TNF-RI, TNF-RII, FasL, CD27L, CD30L, 4-1BBL, TRAIL, RANKL, TWEAK, APRIL, BAFF, LIGHT, VEG1, OX40L, TRAIL Receptor-1, A1 Adenosine Receptor, Lymphotoxin Beta Receptor, TACI, BAFF-R, EPO; LFA-3, ICAM-1, ICAM-3, EpCAM, integrin beta1, integrin beta2, integrin alpha4/beta7, integrin alpha2, integrin alpha3, integrin alpha4, integrin alpha5, integrin alpha6, integrin alphav, alphaVbeta3 integrin, FGFR-3, Keratinocyte Growth Factor, VLA-1, VLA-4, L-selectin, anti-Id, E-selectin, HLA, HLA-DR, CTLA-4, T cell receptor, B7-1, B7-2, VNRintegrin, TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2, eotaxin1, BLyS (B-lymphocyte Stimulator), complement C5, IgE, factor VII, CD64, CBL, NCA 90, EGFR (ErbB-1), Her2/neu (ErbB-2), Her3 (ErbB-3), Her4 (ErbB-4), Tissue Factor, VEGF, VEGFR, endothelin receptor, VLA-4, Hapten NP-cap or NIP-cap, T cell receptor alpha/beta, E-selectin, digoxin, placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) and testicular PLAP-like alkaline phosphatase, transferrin receptor, Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CEACAM5, HMFG PEM, mucin MUC1, MUC18, Heparanase I, human cardiac myosin, tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 (TAG-72), tumor-associated antigen CA 125, Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), High molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MM), carcinoma-associated antigen, Gcoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa), tumor-associated antigen expressing Lewis Y related carbohydrate, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gH envelope glycoprotein, HIV gp120, HCMV, respiratory syncital virus RSV F, RSVF Fgp, VNRintegrin, IL-8, cytokeratin tumor-associated antigen, Hep B gp120, CMV, gpIIbIIIa, HIV IIIB gp120 V3 loop, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Fgp, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) gD glycoprotein, HSV gB glycoprotein, HCMV gB envelope glycoprotein, and \nClostridium perfringens \ntoxin.\n\n\nOne skilled in the art will appreciate that the aforementioned list of targets refers not only to specific proteins and biomolecules, but the biochemical pathway or pathways that comprise them. For example, reference to CTLA-4 as a target antigen implies that the ligands and receptors that make up the T cell co-stimulatory pathway, including CTLA-4, B7-1, B7-2, CD28, and any other undiscovered ligands or receptors that bind these proteins, are also targets. Thus target as used herein refers not only to a specific biomolecule, but the set of proteins that interact with said target and the members of the biochemical pathway to which said target belongs. One skilled in the art will further appreciate that any of the aforementioned target antigens, the ligands or receptors that bind them, or other members of their corresponding biochemical pathway, may be operably linked to the Fc variants of the present invention in order to generate an Fc fusion. Thus for example, an Fc fusion that targets EGFR could be constructed by operably linking an Fc variant to EGF, TGFα, or any other ligand, discovered or undiscovered, that binds EGFR. Accordingly, an Fc variant of the present invention could be operably linked to EGFR in order to generate an Fc fusion that binds EGF, TGFα, or any other ligand, discovered or undiscovered, that binds EGFR. Thus virtually any polypeptide, whether a ligand, receptor, or some other protein or protein domain, including but not limited to the aforementioned targets and the proteins that compose their corresponding biochemical pathways, may be operably linked to the Fc variants of the present invention to develop an Fc fusion.\n\n\nA number of antibodies and Fc fusions that are approved for use, in clinical trials, or in development may benefit from the Fc variants of the present invention. Said antibodies and Fc fusions are herein referred to as “clinical products and candidates”. Thus in a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in a range of clinical products and candidates. For example, a number of antibodies that target CD20 may benefit from the Fc variants of the present invention. For example the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody that is substantially similar to rituximab (Rituxan®, IDEC/Genentech/Roche) (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,137), a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody approved to treat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; HuMax-CD20, an anti-CD20 currently being developed by Genmab, an anti-CD20 antibody described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362, AME-133 (Applied Molecular Evolution), hA20 (Immunomedics, Inc.), and HumaLYM (Intracel). A number of antibodies that target members of the family of epidermal growth factor receptors, including EGFR (ErbB-1), Her2/neu (ErbB-2), Her3 (ErbB-3), Her4 (ErbB-4), may benefit from the Fc variants of the present invention. For example the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody that is substantially similar to trastuzumab (Herceptin®, Genentech) (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,171), a humanized anti-Her2/neu antibody approved to treat breast cancer; pertuzumab (rhuMab-2C4, Omnitarg™), currently being developed by Genentech; an anti-Her2 antibody described in U.S. Pat.

to their precise composition. The Fc variants of the present invention may be incorporated into the aforementioned clinical candidates and products, or into antibodies and Fc fusions that are substantially similar to them. The Fc variants of the present invention may be incorporated into versions of the aforementioned clinical candidates and products that are humanized, affinity matured, engineered, or modified in some other way. Furthermore, the entire polypeptide of the aforementioned clinical products and candidates need not be used to construct a new antibody or Fc fusion that incorporates the Fc variants of the present invention; for example only the variable region of a clinical product or candidate antibody, a substantially similar variable region, or a humanized, affinity matured, engineered, or modified version of the variable region may be used. In another embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody or Fc fusion that binds to the same epitope, antigen, ligand, or receptor as one of the aforementioned clinical products and candidates.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may find use in a wide range of antibody and Fc fusion products. In one embodiment the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is a therapeutic, a diagnostic, or a research reagent, preferably a therapeutic. Alternatively, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may be used for agricultural or industrial uses. In an alternate embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention compose a library that may be screened experimentally. This library may be a list of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, or may be a physical composition of nucleic acids or polypeptides that encode the library sequences. The Fc variant may find use in an antibody composition that is monoclonal or polyclonal. The antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may be agonists, antagonists, neutralizing, inhibitory, or stimulatory. In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are used to kill target cells that bear the target antigen, for example cancer cells. In an alternate embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are used to block, antagonize, or agonize the target antigen, for example for antagonizing a cytokine or cytokine receptor. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are used to block, antagonize, or agonize the target antigen and kill the target cells that bear the target antigen.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be used for various therapeutic purposes. In a preferred embodiment, the Fc variant proteins are administered to a patient to treat an antibody-related disorder. A “patient” for the purposes of the present invention includes both humans and other animals, preferably mammals and most preferably humans. Thus the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention have both human therapy and veterinary applications. In the preferred embodiment the patient is a mammal, and in the most preferred embodiment the patient is human. The term “treatment” in the present invention is meant to include therapeutic treatment, as well as prophylactic, or suppressive measures for a disease or disorder. Thus, for example, successful administration of an antibody or Fc fusion prior to onset of the disease results in treatment of the disease. As another example, successful administration of an optimized antibody or Fc fusion after clinical manifestation of the disease to combat the symptoms of the disease comprises treatment of the disease. “Treatment” also encompasses administration of an optimized antibody or Fc fusion protein after the appearance of the disease in order to eradicate the disease. Successful administration of an agent after onset and after clinical symptoms have developed, with possible abatement of clinical symptoms and perhaps amelioration of the disease, comprises treatment of the disease. Those “in need of treatment” include mammals already having the disease or disorder, as well as those prone to having the disease or disorder, including those in which the disease or disorder is to be prevented.

By “prodrug” as used herein is meant a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance that is less cytotoxic to tumor cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically activated or converted into the more active parent form. See, for example Wilman, 1986, Biochemical Society Transactions, 615th Meeting Belfast, 14:375-382; and Stella et al., “Prodrugs: A Chemical Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery,” Directed Drug Delivery, Borchardt et al., (ed.): 247-267, Humana Press, 1985.

Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use with the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention include but are not limited to any of the aforementioned chemotherapeutic agents.\n\n\nThe antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may be combined with other therapeutic regimens. For example, in one embodiment, the patient to be treated with the antibody or Fc fusion may also receive radiation therapy. Radiation therapy can be administered according to protocols commonly employed in the art and known to the skilled artisan. Such therapy includes but is not limited to cesium, iridium, iodine, or cobalt radiation. The radiation therapy may be whole body irradiation, or may be directed locally to a specific site or tissue in or on the body, such as the lung, bladder, or prostate. Typically, radiation therapy is administered in pulses over a period of time from about 1 to 2 weeks. The radiation therapy may, however, be administered over longer periods of time. For instance, radiation therapy may be administered to patients having head and neck cancer for about 6 to about 7 weeks. Optionally, the radiation therapy may be administered as a single dose or as multiple, sequential doses. The skilled medical practitioner can determine empirically the appropriate dose or doses of radiation therapy useful herein. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention and one or more other anti-cancer therapies are employed to treat cancer cells ex vivo. It is contemplated that such ex vivo treatment may be useful in bone marrow transplantation and particularly, autologous bone marrow transplantation. For instance, treatment of cells or tissue(s) containing cancer cells with antibody or Fc fusion and one or more other anti-cancer therapies, such as described above, can be employed to deplete or substantially deplete the cancer cells prior to transplantation in a recipient patient. It is of course contemplated that the antibodies and Fc fusions of the invention can be employed in combination with still other therapeutic techniques such as surgery.\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are administered with a cytokine. By “cytokine” as used herein is meant a generic term for proteins released by one cell population that act on another cell as intercellular mediators. Examples of such cytokines are lymphokines, monokines, and traditional polypeptide hormones. Included among the cytokines are growth hormone such as human growth hormone, N-methionyl human growth hormone, and bovine growth hormone; parathyroid hormone; thyroxine; insulin; proinsulin; relaxin; prorelaxin; glycoprotein hormones such as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH); hepatic growth factor; fibroblast growth factor; prolactin; placental lactogen; tumor necrosis factor-alpha and -beta; mullerian-inhibiting substance; mouse gonadotropin-associated peptide; inhibin; activin; vascular endothelial growth factor; integrin; thrombopoietin (TPO); nerve growth factors such as NGF-beta; platelet-growth factor; transforming growth factors (TGFs) such as TGF-alpha and TGF-beta; insulin-like growth factor-I and -II; erythropoietin (EPO); osteoinductive factors; interferons such as interferon-alpha, beta, and -gamma; colony stimulating factors (CSFs) such as macrophage-CSF (M-CSF); granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF); and granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF); interleukins (ILs) such as IL-1, IL-1alpha, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12; IL-15, a tumor necrosis factor such as TNF-alpha or TNF-beta; and other polypeptide factors including LIF and kit ligand (KL). As used herein, the term cytokine includes proteins from natural sources or from recombinant cell culture, and biologically active equivalents of the native sequence cytokines.\n\n\nA variety of other therapeutic agents may find use for administration with the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention. In one embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is administered with an anti-angiogenic agent. By “anti-angiogenic agent” as used herein is meant a compound that blocks, or interferes to some degree, the development of blood vessels. The anti-angiogenic factor may, for instance, be a small molecule or a protein, for example an antibody, Fc fusion, or cytokine, that binds to a growth factor or growth factor receptor involved in promoting angiogenesis. The preferred anti-angiogenic factor herein is an antibody that binds to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is administered with a therapeutic agent that induces or enhances adaptive immune response, for example an antibody that targets CTLA-4. In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is administered with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. By “tyrosine kinase inhibitor” as used herein is meant a molecule that inhibits to some extent tyrosine kinase activity of a tyrosine kinase. Examples of such inhibitors include but are not limited to quinazolines, such as PD 153035, 4-(3-chloroanilino) quinazoline; pyridopyrimidines; pyrimidopyrimidines; pyrrolopyrimidines, such as CGP 59326, CGP 60261 and CGP 62706; pyrazolopyrimidines, 4-(phenylamino)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines; curcumin (diferuloyl methane, 4,5-bis(4-fluoroanilino)phthalimide); tyrphostines containing nitrothiophene moieties; PD-0183805 (Warner-Lambert); antisense molecules (e.g. those that bind to ErbB-encoding nucleic acid); quinoxalines (U.S. Pat. No. 5,804,396); tryphostins (U.S. Pat. No. 5,804,396); ZD6474 (Astra Zeneca); PTK-787 (Novartis/Schering A G); pan-ErbB inhibitors such as C1-1033 (Pfizer); Affinitac (ISIS 3521; Isis/Lilly); Imatinib mesylate (STI571, Gleevec®; Novartis); PKI 166 (Novartis); GW2016 (Glaxo SmithKline); C1-1033 (Pfizer); EKB-569 (Wyeth); Semaxinib (Sugen); ZD6474 (AstraZeneca); PTK-787 (Novartis/Schering AG); INC-1C11 (Imclone); or as described in any of the following patent publications: U.S. Pat. No. 5,804,396; PCT WO 99/09016 (American Cyanimid); PCT WO 98/43960 (American Cyanamid); PCT WO 97/38983 (Warner-Lambert); PCT WO 99/06378 (Warner-Lambert); PCT WO 99/06396 (Warner-Lambert); PCT WO 96/30347 (Pfizer, Inc); PCT WO 96/33978 (AstraZeneca); PCT WO96/3397 (AstraZeneca); PCT WO 96/33980 (AstraZeneca), gefitinib (IRESSA™, ZD1839, AstraZeneca), and OSI-774 (Tarceva™, OSI Pharmaceuticals/Genentech).\n\n\nA variety of linkers may find use in the present invention to generate Fc fusions (see definition above) or antibody- or Fc fusion-conjugates (see definition below). By “linker”, “linker sequence”, “spacer”, “tethering sequence” or grammatical equivalents thereof, herein is meant a molecule or group of molecules (such as a monomer or polymer) that connects two molecules and often serves to place the two molecules in a preferred configuration. A number of strategies may be used to covalently link molecules together. These include, but are not limited to polypeptide linkages between N- and C-termini of proteins or protein domains, linkage via disulfide bonds, and linkage via chemical cross-linking reagents. In one aspect of this embodiment, the linker is a peptide bond, generated by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. Choosing a suitable linker for a specific case where two polypeptide chains are to be connected depends on various parameters, including but not limited to the nature of the two polypeptide chains (e.g., whether they naturally oligomerize), the distance between the N- and the C-termini to be connected if known, and/or the stability of the linker towards proteolysis and oxidation. Furthermore, the linker may contain amino acid residues that provide flexibility. Thus, the linker peptide may predominantly include the following amino acid residues: Gly, Ser, Ala, or Thr. The linker peptide should have a length that is adequate to link two molecules in such a way that they assume the correct conformation relative to one another so that they retain the desired activity. Suitable lengths for this purpose include at least one and not more than 30 amino acid residues. Preferably, the linker is from about 1 to 30 amino acids in length, with linkers of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 19 and 20 amino acids in length being preferred. In addition, the amino acid residues selected for inclusion in the linker peptide should exhibit properties that do not interfere significantly with the activity of the polypeptide. Thus, the linker peptide on the whole should not exhibit a charge that would be inconsistent with the activity of the polypeptide, or interfere with internal folding, or form bonds or other interactions with amino acid residues in one or more of the monomers that would seriously impede the binding of receptor monomer domains. Useful linkers include glycine-serine polymers (including, for example, (GS)n, (GSGGS)n (GGGGS)n and (GGGS)n, where n is an integer of at least one), glycine-alanine polymers, alanine-serine polymers, and other flexible linkers such as the tether for the shaker potassium channel, and a large variety of other flexible linkers, as will be appreciated by those in the art. Glycine-serine polymers are preferred since both of these amino acids are relatively unstructured, and therefore may be able to serve as a neutral tether between components. Secondly, serine is hydrophilic and therefore able to solubilize what could be a globular glycine chain. Third, similar chains have been shown to be effective in joining subunits of recombinant proteins such as single chain antibodies. Suitable linkers may also be identified by screening databases of known three-dimensional structures for naturally occurring motifs that can bridge the gap between two polypeptide chains. In a preferred embodiment, the linker is not immunogenic when administered in a human patient. Thus linkers may be chosen such that they have low immunogenicity or are thought to have low immunogenicity. For example, a linker may be chosen that exists naturally in a human. In a preferred embodiment the linker has the sequence of the hinge region of an antibody, that is the sequence that links the antibody Fab and Fc regions; alternatively the linker has a sequence that comprises part of the hinge region, or a sequence that is substantially similar to the hinge region of an antibody. Another way of obtaining a suitable linker is by optimizing a simple linker, e.g., (Gly4Ser)n, through random mutagenesis. Alternatively, once a suitable polypeptide linker is defined, additional linker polypeptides can be created to select amino acids that more optimally interact with the domains being linked. Other types of linkers that may be used in the present invention include artificial polypeptide linkers and inteins. In another embodiment, disulfide bonds are designed to link the two molecules. In another embodiment, linkers are chemical cross-linking agents. For example, a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents may be used, including but not limited to N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntolyene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al., 1971, Science 238:1098. Chemical linkers may enable chelation of an isotope. For example, Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody (see PCT WO 94/11026). The linker may be cleavable, facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker, peptidase-sensitive linker, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linker (Chari et al., 1992, Cancer Research 52: 127-131) may be used. Alternatively, a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, including but not limited to polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, polyoxyalkylenes, or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, may find use as linkers, that is may find use to link the Fc variants of the present invention to a fusion partner to generate an Fc fusion, or to link the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention to a conjugate.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is conjugated or operably linked to another therapeutic compound, referred to herein as a conjugate. The conjugate may be a cytotoxic agent, a chemotherapeutic agent, a cytokine, an anti-angiogenic agent, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, a toxin, a radioisotope, or other therapeutically active agent. Chemotherapeutic agents, cytokines, anti-angiogenic agents, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and other therapeutic agents have been described above, and all of these aforemention therapeutic agents may find use as antibody or Fc fusion conjugates. In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is conjugated or operably linked to a toxin, including but not limited to small molecule toxins and enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including fragments and/or variants thereof. Small molecule toxins include but are not limited to calicheamicin, maytansine (U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020), trichothene, and CC1065. In one embodiment of the invention, the antibody or Fc fusion is conjugated to one or more maytansine molecules (e.g. about 1 to about 10 maytansine molecules per antibody molecule). Maytansine may, for example, be converted to May-SS-Me which may be reduced to May-SH3 and reacted with modified antibody or Fc fusion (Chari et al., 1992\n, Cancer Research \n52: 127-131) to generate a maytansinoid-antibody or maytansinoid-Fc fusion conjugate. Another conjugate of interest comprises an antibody or Fc fusion conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double-stranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. Structural analogues of calicheamicin that may be used include but are not limited to γ\n1\n \n1\n, α\n2\n \n1\n, α\n3\n, N-acetyl-γ\n1\n \n1\n, PSAG, and Θ\n1\n \n1\n, (Hinman et al., 1993\n, Cancer Research \n53:3336-3342; Lode et al., 1998\n, Cancer Research \n58:2925-2928) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,714,586; U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,374; U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,586; U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,001). \nDolastatin\n 10 analogs such as auristatin E (AE) and monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) may find use as conjugates for the Fc variants of the present invention (Doronina et al., 2003\n, Nat Biotechnol \n21(7):778-84; Francisco et al., 2003 \nBlood \n102(4):1458-65). Useful enyzmatically active toxins include but are not limited to diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, \nAleurites fordii \nproteins, dianthin proteins, \nPhytolaca americana \nproteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), \nmomordica charantia \ninhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin and the tricothecenes. See, for example, PCT WO 93/21232. The present invention further contemplates a conjugate or fusion formed between an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention and a compound with nucleolytic activity, for example a ribonuclease or DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease (DNase).\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may be conjugated or operably linked to a radioisotope to form a radioconjugate. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugate antibodies and Fc fusions. Examples include, but are not limited to, At\n211\n, I\n131\n, I\n125\n, Y\n90\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188\n, Sm\n153\n, Bi\n212\n, P\n32\n, and radioactive isotopes of Lu.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may be conjugated to a “receptor” (such streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pretargeting wherein the antibody-receptor or Fc fusion-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a “ligand” (e.g. avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g. a radionucleotide). In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is conjugated or operably linked to an enzyme in order to employ Antibody Dependent Enzyme Mediated Prodrug Therapy (ADEPT). ADEPT may be used by conjugating or operably linking the antibody or Fc fusion to a prodrug-activating enzyme that converts a prodrug (e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent, see PCT WO 81/01145) to an active anti-cancer drug. See, for example, PCT WO 88/07378 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,278. The enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active, cytotoxic form. Enzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include but are not limited to alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; cytosine deaminase useful for converting non-toxic 5-fluorocytosine into the anti-cancer drug, 5-fluorouracil; proteases, such as serratia protease, thermolysin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidases and cathepsins (such as cathepsins B and L), that are useful for converting peptide-containing prodrugs into free drugs; D-alanylcarboxypeptidases, useful for converting prodrugs that contain D-amino acid substituents; carbohydrate-cleaving enzymes such as beta.-galactosidase and neuramimidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs; beta-lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized with .alpha.-lactams into free drugs; and penicillin amidases, such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase, useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups, respectively, into free drugs. Alternatively, antibodies with enzymatic activity, also known in the art as “abzymes”, can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs (see, for example, Massey, 1987\n, Nature \n328: 457-458). Antibody-abzyme and Fc fusion-abzyme conjugates can be prepared for delivery of the abzyme to a tumor cell population.\n\n\nOther modifications of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are contemplated herein. For example, the antibody or Fc fusion may be linked to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, polyoxyalkylenes, or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions are contemplated wherein an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention and one or more therapeutically active agents are formulated. Formulations of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are prepared for storage by mixing said antibody or Fc fusion having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed., 1980), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, acetate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl orbenzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; sweeteners and other flavoring agents; fillers such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, corn and other starches; binding agents; additives; coloring agents; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG). In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition that comprises the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is in a water-soluble form, such as being present as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which is meant to include both acid and base addition salts. “Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt” refers to those salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the free bases and that are not biologically or otherwise undesirable, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. “Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts” include those derived from inorganic bases such as sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum salts and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, and ethanolamine. The formulations to be used for in vivo administration are preferrably sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes or other methods.\n\n\nThe antibodies and Fc fusions disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. A liposome is a small vesicle comprising various types of lipids, phospholipids and/or surfactant that is useful for delivery of a therapeutic agent to a mammal. Liposomes containing the antibody or Fc fusion are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in Epstein et al., 1985\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, \n82:3688; Hwang et al., 1980\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, \n77:4030; U.S. Pat. No. 4,485,045; U.S. Pat. No. 4,544,545; and PCT WO 97/38731. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. A chemotherapeutic agent or other therapeutically active agent is optionally contained within the liposome (Gabizon et al., 1989\n, J National Cancer Inst \n81:1484).\n\n\nThe antibodies, Fc fusions, and other therapeutically active agents may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared by methods including but not limited to coacervation techniques, interfacial polymerization (for example using hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules, or poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules), colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules), and macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed., 1980. Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymer, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (which are injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid, and ProLease® (commercially available from Alkermes), which is a microsphere-based delivery system composed of the desired bioactive molecule incorporated into a matrix of poly-DL-lactide-co-glycolide (PLG).\n\n\nThe concentration of the therapeutically active antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention in the formulation may vary from about 0.1 to 100 weight %. In a preferred embodiment, the concentration of the antibody or Fc fusion is in the range of 0.003 to 1.0 molar. In order to treat a patient, a therapeutically effective dose of the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may be administered. By “therapeutically effective dose” herein is meant a dose that produces the effects for which it is administered. The exact dose will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques. Dosages may range from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg of body weight or greater, for example 0.1, 1, 10, or 50 mg/kg of body weight, with 1 to 10 mg/kg being preferred. As is known in the art, adjustments for antibody or Fc fusion degradation, systemic versus localized delivery, and rate of new protease synthesis, as well as the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, drug interaction and the severity of the condition may be necessary, and will be ascertainable with routine experimentation by those skilled in the art.\n\n\nAdministration of the pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention, preferably in the form of a sterile aqueous solution, may be done in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to orally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intranasally, intraotically, transdermally, topically (e.g., gels, salves, lotions, creams, etc.), intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, intrapulmonary (e.g., AERx® inhalable technology commercially available from Aradigm, or Inhance™ pulmonary delivery system commercially available from Inhale Therapeutics), vaginally, parenterally, rectally, or intraocularly. In some instances, for example for the treatment of wounds, inflammation, etc., the antibody or Fc fusion may be directly applied as a solution or spray. As is known in the art, the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated accordingly depending upon the manner of introduction.\n\n\nEngineering Methods\n\n\nThe present invention provides engineering methods that may be used to generate Fc variants. A principal obstacle that has hindered previous attempts at Fc engineering is that only random attempts at modification have been possible, due in part to the inefficiency of engineering strategies and methods, and to the low-throughput nature of antibody production and screening. The present invention describes engineering methods that overcome these shortcomings. A variety of design strategies, computational screening methods, library generation methods, and experimental production and screening methods are contemplated. These strategies, approaches, techniques, and methods may be applied individually or in various combinations to engineer optimized Fc variants.\n\n\nDesign Strategies\n\n\nThe most efficient approach to generating Fc variants that are optimized for a desired property is to direct the engineering efforts toward that goal. Accordingly, the present invention teaches design strategies that may be used to engineer optimized Fc variants. The use of a design strategy is meant to guide Fc engineering, but is not meant to constrain an Fc variant to a particular optimized property based on the design strategy that was used to engineer it. At first thought this may seem counterintuitive; however its validity is derived from the enormous complexity of subtle interactions that determine the structure, stability, solubility, and function of proteins and protein-protein complexes. Although efforts can be made to predict which protein positions, residues, interactions, etc. are important for a design goal, often times critical ones are not predictable. Effects on protein structure, stability, solubility, and function, whether favorable or unfavorable, are often unforeseen. Yet there are innumerable amino acid modifications that are detrimental or deleterious to proteins. Thus often times the best approach to engineering comes from generation of protein variants that are focused generally towards a design goal but do not cause detrimental effects. In this way, a principal objective of a design strategy may be the generation of quality diversity. At a simplistic level this can be thought of as stacking the odds in one's favor. As an example, perturbation of the Fc carbohydrate or a particular domain-domain angle, as described below, are valid design strategies for generating optimized Fc variants, despite the fact that how carbohydrate and domain-domain angles determine the properties of Fc is not well understood. By reducing the number of detrimental amino acid modifications that are screened, i.e. by screening quality diversity, these design strategies become practical. Thus the true value of the design strategies taught in the present invention is their ability to direct engineering efforts towards the generation of valuable Fc variants. The specific value of any one resulting variant is determined after experimentation.\n\n\nOne design strategy for engineering Fc variants is provided in which interaction of Fc with some Fc ligand is altered by engineering amino acid modifications at the interface between Fc and said Fc ligand. Fc ligands herein may include but are not limited to FcγRs, C1q, FcRn, protein A or G, and the like. By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at Fc positions that impact the binding interface, variants can be engineered that sample new interface conformations, some of which may improve binding to the Fc ligand, some of which may reduce Fc ligand binding, and some of which may have other favorable properties. Such new interface conformations could be the result of, for example, direct interaction with Fc ligand residues that form the interface, or indirect effects caused by the amino acid modifications such as perturbation of side chain or backbone conformations. Variable positions may be chosen as any positions that are believed to play an important role in determining the conformation of the interface. For example, variable positions may be chosen as the set of residues that are within a certain distance, for example 5 Angstroms (Å), preferrably between 1 and 10 Å, of any residue that makes direct contact with the Fc ligand.\n\n\nAn additional design strategy for generating Fc variants is provided in which the conformation of the Fc carbohydrate at N297 is optimized. Optimization as used in this context is meant to includes conformational and compositional changes in the N297 carbohydrate that result in a desired property, for example increased or reduced affinity for an FcγR. Such a strategy is supported by the observation that the carbohydrate structure and conformation dramatically affect Fc/FcγR and Fc/C1q binding (Umana et al., 1999\n, Nat Biotechnol \n17:176-180; Davies et al., 2001\n, Biotechnol Bioeng \n74:288-294; Mimura et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:45539-45547.; Radaev et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:16478-16483; Shields et al., 2002\n, J Biol Chem \n277:26733-26740; Shinkawa et al., 2003\n, J Biol Chem \n278:3466-3473). However the carbohydrate makes no specific contacts with FcγRs. By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at positions that interact with carbohydrate, a quality diversity of variants can be engineered that sample new carbohydrate conformations, some of which may improve and some of which may reduce binding to one or more Fc ligands. While the majority of mutations near the Fc/carbohydrate interface appear to alter carbohydrate conformation, some mutations have been shown to alter the glycosylation composition (Lund et al., 1996\n, J Immunol \n157:4963-4969; Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65).\n\n\nAnother design strategy for generating Fc variants is provided in which the angle between the Cγ2 and Cγ3 domains is optimized Optimization as used in this context is meant to describe conformational changes in the Cγ2-Cγ3 domain angle that result in a desired property, for example increased or reduced affinity for an FcγR. This angle is an important determinant of Fc/FcγR affinity (Radaev et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:16478-16483), and a number of mutations distal to the Fc/FcγR interface affect binding potentially by modulating it (Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604). By exploring energetically favorable substitutions positions that appear to play a key role in determining the Cγ2-Cγ3 angle and the flexibility of the domains relative to one another, a quality diversity of variants can be designed that sample new angles and levels of flexibility, some of which may be optimized for a desired Fc property.\n\n\nAnother design strategy for generating Fc variants is provided in which Fc is reengineered to eliminate the structural and functional dependence on glycosylation. This design strategy involves the optimization of Fc structure, stability, solubility, and/or Fc function (for example affinity of Fc for one or more Fc ligands) in the absence of the N297 carbohydrate. In one approach, positions that are exposed to solvent in the absence of glycosylation are engineered such that they are stable, structurally consistent with Fc structure, and have no tendency to aggregate. The Cγ2 is the only unpaired Ig domain in the antibody (see \nFIG. 1\n). Thus the N297 carbohydrate covers up the exposed hydrophobic patch that would normally be the interface for a protein-protein interaction with another Ig domain, maintaining the stability and structural integrity of Fc and keeping the Cγ2 domains from aggregating across the central axis. Approaches for optimizing aglycosylated Fc may involve but are not limited to designing amino acid modifications that enhance aglycoslated Fc stability and/or solubility by incorporating polar and/or charged residues that face inward towards the Cγ2-Cγ2 dimer axis, and by designing amino acid modifications that directly enhance the aglycosylated Fc/FcγR interface or the interface of aglycosylated Fc with some other Fc ligand.\n\n\nAn additional design strategy for engineering Fc variants is provided in which the conformation of the Cγ2 domain is optimized Optimization as used in this context is meant to describe conformational changes in the Cγ2 domain angle that result in a desired property, for example increased or reduced affinity for an FcγR. By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at Cγ2 positions that impact the Cγ2 conformation, a quality diversity of variants can be engineered that sample new Cγ2 conformations, some of which may achieve the design goal. Such new Cγ2 conformations could be the result of, for example, alternate backbone conformations that are sampled by the variant. Variable positions may be chosen as any positions that are believed to play an important role in determining Cγ2 structure, stability, solubility, flexibility, function, and the like. For example, Cγ2 hydrophobic core residues, that is Cγ2 residues that are partially or fully sequestered from solvent, may be reengineered. Alternatively, noncore residues may be considered, or residues that are deemed important for determining backbone structure, stability, or flexibility.\n\n\nAn additional design strategy for Fc optimization is provided in which binding to an FcγR, complement, or some other Fc ligand is altered by modifications that modulate the electrostatic interaction between Fc and said Fc ligand. Such modifications may be thought of as optimization of the global electrostatic character of Fc, and include replacement of neutral amino acids with a charged amino acid, replacement of a charged amino acid with a neutral amino acid, or replacement of a charged amino acid with an amino acid of opposite charge (i.e. charge reversal). Such modifications may be used to effect changes in binding affinity between an Fc and one or more Fc ligands, for example FcγRs. In a preferred embodiment, positions at which electrostatic substitutions might affect binding are selected using one of a variety of well known methods for calculation of electrostatic potentials. In the simplest embodiment, Coulomb's law is used to generate electrostatic potentials as a function of the position in the protein. Additional embodiments include the use of Debye-Huckel scaling to account for ionic strength effects, and more sophisticated embodiments such as Poisson-Boltzmann calculations. Such electrostatic calculations may highlight positions and suggest specific amino acid modifications to achieve the design goal. In some cases, these substitutions may be anticipated to variably affect binding to different Fc ligands, for example to enhance binding to activating FcγRs while decreasing binding affinity to inhibitory FcγRs.\n\n\nComputational Screening\n\n\nA principal obstacle to obtaining valuable Fc variants is the difficulty in predicting what amino acid modifications, out of the enormous number of possibilities, will achieve the desired goals. Indeed one of the principle reasons that previous attempts at Fc engineering have failed to produce Fc variants of significant clinical value is that approaches to Fc engineering have thus far involved hit-or-miss approaches. The present invention provides computational screening methods that enable quantitative and systematic engineering of Fc variants. These methods typically use atomic level scoring functions, side chain rotamer sampling, and advanced optimization methods to accurately capture the relationships between protein sequence, structure, and function. Computational screening enables exploration of the entire sequence space of possibilities at target positions by filtering the enormous diversity which results. Variant libraries that are screened computationally are effectively enriched for stable, properly folded, and functional sequences, allowing active optimization of Fc for a desired goal. Because of the overlapping sequence constraints on protein structure, stability, solubility, and function, a large number of the candidates in a library occupy “wasted” sequence space. For example, a large fraction of sequence space encodes unfolded, misfolded, incompletely folded, partially folded, or aggregated proteins. This is particularly relevant for Fc engineering because Ig domains are small beta sheet structures, the engineering of which has proven extremely demanding (Quinn et al., 1994\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n91:8747-8751; Richardson et al., 2002\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n99:2754-2759). Even seemingly harmless substitutions on the surface of a beta sheet can cause severe packing conflicts, dramatically disrupting folding equilibrium (Smith et al., 1995\n, Science \n270:980-982); incidentally, alanine is one of the worst beta sheet formers (Minor et al., 1994\n, Nature \n371:264-267). The determinants of beta sheet stability and specificity are a delicate balance between an extremely large number of subtle interactions. Computational screening enables the generation of libraries that are composed primarily of productive sequence space, and as a result increases the chances of identifying proteins that are optimized for the design goal. In effect, computational screening yields an increased hit-rate, thereby decreasing the number of variants that must be screened experimentally. An additional obstacle to Fc engineering is the need for active design of correlated or coupled mutations. For example, the greatest Fc/FcγR affinity enhancement observed thus far is S298A/E333A/K334A, obtained by combining three better binders obtained separately in an alanine scan (Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604). Computational screening is capable of generating such a three-fold variant in one experiment instead of three separate ones, and furthermore is able to test the functionality of all 20 amino acids at those positions instead of just alanine. Computational screening deals with such complexity by reducing the combinatorial problem to an experimentally tractable size.\n\n\nComputational screening, viewed broadly, has four steps: 1) selection and preparation of the protein template structure or structures, 2) selection of variable positions, amino acids to be considered at those positions, and/or selection of rotamers to model considered amino acids, 3) energy calculation, and 4) combinatorial optimization. In more detail, the process of computational screening can be described as follows. A three-dimensional structure of a protein is used as the starting point. The positions to be optimized are identified, which may be the entire protein sequence or subset(s) thereof. Amino acids that will be considered at each position are selected. In a preferred embodiment, each considered amino acid may be represented by a discrete set of allowed conformations, called rotamers. Interaction energies are calculated between each considered amino acid and each other considered amino acid, and the rest of the protein, including the protein backbone and invariable residues. In a preferred embodiment, interaction energies are calculated between each considered amino acid side chain rotamer and each other considered amino acid side chain rotamer and the rest of the protein, including the protein backbone and invariable residues. One or more combinatorial search algorithms are then used to identify the lowest energy sequence and/or low energy sequences.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the computational screening method used is substantially similar to Protein Design Automation® (PDA®) technology, as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,188,965; U.S. Pat. No. 6,269,312; U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. No. 09/782,004; U.S. Ser. No. 09/927,790; U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588. In another preferred embodiment, a computational screening method substantially similar to Sequence Prediction Algorithm™ (SPA™) technology is used, as is described in (Raha et al., 2000\n, Protein Sci \n9:1106-1119), U.S. Ser. No. 09/877,695, and U.S. Ser. No. 10/071,859. In another preferred embodiment, the computational screening methods described in U.S. Ser. No. 10/339,788, filed on Mar. 3, 2003, entitled “ANTIBODY OPTIMIZATION”, are used. In some embodiments, combinations of different computational screening methods are used, including combinations of PDA® technology and SPA™ technology, as well as combinations of these computational methods in combination with other design tools. Similarly, these computational methods can be used simultaneously or sequentially, in any order.\n\n\nA template structure is used as input into the computational screening calculations. By “template structure” herein is meant the structural coordinates of part or all of a protein to be optimized. The template structure may be any protein for which a three dimensional structure (that is, three dimensional coordinates for a set of the protein's atoms) is known or may be calculated, estimated, modeled, generated, or determined. The three dimensional structures of proteins may be determined using methods including but not limited to X-ray crystallographic techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, de novo modeling, and homology modeling. If optimization is desired for a protein for which the structure has not been solved experimentally, a suitable structural model may be generated that may serve as the template for computational screening calculations. Methods for generating homology models of proteins are known in the art, and these methods find use in the present invention. See for example, Luo, et al. 2002\n, Protein Sci \n11: 1218-1226, Lehmann & Wyss, 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n12(4):371-5.; Lehmann et al., 2000\n, Biochim Biophys Acta \n1543(2):408-415; Rath & Davidson, 2000\n, Protein Sci, \n9(12):2457-69; Lehmann et al., 2000\n, Protein Eng \n13(1):49-57; Desjarlais & Berg, 1993\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n90(6):2256-60; Desjarlais & Berg, 1992\n, Proteins \n12(2):101-4; Henikoff & Henikoff, 2000\n, Adv Protein Chem \n54:73-97; Henikoff & Henikoff, 1994\n, J Mol Biol \n243(4):574-8; Morea et al., 2000\n, Methods \n20:267-269. Protein/protein complexes may also be obtained using docking methods. Suitable protein structures that may serve as template structures include, but are not limited to, all of those found in the Protein Data Base compiled and serviced by the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB, formerly the Brookhaven National Lab).\n\n\nThe template structure may be of a protein that occurs naturally or is engineered. The template structure may be of a protein that is substantially encoded by a protein from any organism, with human, mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey preferred. The template structure may comprise any of a number of protein structural forms. In a preferred embodiment the template structure comprises an Fc region or a domain or fragment of Fc. In an alternately preferred embodiment the template structure comprises Fc or a domain or fragment of Fc bound to one or more Fc ligands, with an Fc/FcγR complex being preferred. The Fc in the template structure may be glycosylated or unglycosylated. The template structure may comprise more than one protein chain. The template structure may additionally contain nonprotein components, including but not limited to small molecules, substrates, cofactors, metals, water molecules, prosthetic groups, polymers and carbohydrates. In a preferred embodiment, the template structure is a plurality or set of template proteins, for example an ensemble of structures such as those obtained from NMR. Alternatively, the set of template structures is generated from a set of related proteins or structures, or artificially created ensembles. The composition and source of the template structure depends on the engineering goal. For example, for enhancement of human Fc/FcγR affinity, a human Fc/FcγR complex structure or derivative thereof may be used as the template structure. Alternatively, the uncomplexed Fc structure may be used as the template structure. If the goal is to enhance affinity of a human Fc for a mouse FcγR, the template structure may be a structure or model of a human Fc bound to a mouse FcγR.\n\n\nThe template structure may be modified or altered prior to design calculations. A variety of methods for template structure preparation are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,188,965; U.S. Pat. No. 6,269,312; U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. No. 09/782,004; U.S. Ser. No. 09/927,790; U.S. Ser. No. 09/877,695; U.S. Ser. No. 10/071,859, U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588. For example, in a preferred embodiment, explicit hydrogens may be added if not included within the structure. In an alternate embodiment, energy minimization of the structure is run to relax strain, including strain due to van der Waals clashes, unfavorable bond angles, and unfavorable bond lengths. Alternatively, the template structure is altered using other methods, such as manually, including directed or random perturbations. It is also possible to modify the template structure during later steps of computational screening, including during the energy calculation and combinatorial optimization steps. In an alternate embodiment, the template structure is not modified before or during computational screening calculations.\n\n\nOnce a template structure has been obtained, variable positions are chosen. By “variable position” herein is meant a position at which the amino acid identity is allowed to be altered in a computational screening calculation. As is known in the art, allowing amino acid modifications to be considered only at certain variable positions reduces the complexity of a calculation and enables computational screening to be more directly tailored for the design goal. One or more residues may be variable positions in computational screening calculations. Positions that are chosen as variable positions may be those that contribute to or are hypothesized to contribute to the protein property to be optimized, for example Fc affinity for an FcγR, Fc stability, Fc solubility, and so forth. Residues at variable positions may contribute favorably or unfavorably to a specific protein property. For example, a residue at an Fc/FcγR interface may be involved in mediating binding, and thus this position may be varied in design calculations aimed at improving Fc/FcγR affinity. As another example, a residue that has an exposed hydrophobic side chain may be responsible for causing unfavorable aggregation, and thus this position may be varied in design calculations aimed at improving solubility. Variable positions may be those positions that are directly involved in interactions that are determinants of a particular protein property. For example, the FcγR binding site of Fc may be defined to include all residues that contact that particular FγcR. By “contact” herein is meant some chemical interaction between at least one atom of an Fc residue with at least one atom of the bound FcγR, with chemical interaction including, but not limited to van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bond interactions, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions. In an alternative embodiment, variable positions may include those positions that are indirectly involved in a protein property, i.e. such positions may be proximal to residues that are known to or hypothesized to contribute to an Fc property. For example, the FcγR binding site of an Fc may be defined to include all Fc residues within a certain distance, for example 4-10 Å, of any Fc residue that is in van der Waals contact with the FcγR. Thus variable positions in this case may be chosen not only as residues that directly contact the FcγR, but also those that contact residues that contact the FcγR and thus influence binding indirectly. The specific positions chosen are dependent on the design strategy being employed.\n\n\nOne or more positions in the template structure that are not variable may be floated. By “floated position” herein is meant a position at which the amino acid conformation but not the amino acid identity is allowed to vary in a computational screening calculation. In one embodiment, the floated position may have the parent amino acid identity. For example, floated positions may be positions that are within a small distance, for example 5 Å, of a variable position residue. In an alternate embodiment, a floated position may have a non-parent amino acid identity. Such an embodiment may find use in the present invention, for example, when the goal is to evaluate the energetic or structural outcome of a specific mutation.\n\n\nPositions that are not variable or floated are fixed. By “fixed position” herein is meant a position at which the amino acid identity and the conformation are held constant in a computational screening calculation. Positions that may be fixed include residues that are not known to be or hypothesized to be involved in the property to be optimized. In this case the assumption is that there is little or nothing to be gained by varying these positions. Positions that are fixed may also include positions whose residues are known or hypothesized to be important for maintaining proper folding, structure, stability, solubility, and/or biological function. For example, positions may be fixed for residues that interact with a particular Fc ligand or residues that encode a glycosylation site in order to ensure that binding to the Fc ligand and proper glycosylation respectively are not perturbed. Likewise, if stability is being optimized, it may be beneficial to fix positions that directly or indirectly interact with an Fc ligand, for example an FcγR, so that binding is not perturbed. Fixed positions may also include structurally important residues such as cysteines participating in disulfide bridges, residues critical for determining backbone conformation such as proline or glycine, critical hydrogen bonding residues, and residues that form favorable packing interactions.\n\n\nThe next step in computational screening is to select a set of possible amino acid identities that will be considered at each particular variable position. This set of possible amino acids is herein referred to as “considered amino acids” at a variable position. “Amino acids” as used herein refers to the set of natural 20 amino acids and any nonnatural or synthetic analogues. In one embodiment, all 20 natural amino acids are considered. Alternatively, a subset of amino acids, or even only one amino acid is considered at a given variable position. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, there is a computational benefit to considering only certain amino acid identities at variable positions, as it decreases the combinatorial complexity of the search. Furthermore, considering only certain amino acids at variable positions may be used to tailor calculations toward specific design strategies. For example, for solubility optimization of aglycosylated Fc, it may be beneficial to allow only polar amino acids to be considered at nonpolar Fc residues that are exposed to solvent in the absence of carbohydrate. Nonnatural amino acids, including synthetic amino acids and analogues of natural amino acids, may also be considered amino acids. For example see Chin et al., 2003\n, Science, \n301(5635):964-7; and Chin et al., 2003\n, Chem. Biol. \n10(6):511-9.\n\n\nA wide variety of methods may be used, alone or in combination, to select which amino acids will be considered at each position. For example, the set of considered amino acids at a given variable position may be chosen based on the degree of exposure to solvent. Hydrophobic or nonpolar amino acids typically reside in the interior or core of a protein, which are inaccessible or nearly inaccessible to solvent. Thus at variable core positions it may be beneficial to consider only or mostly nonpolar amino acids such as alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine. Hydrophilic or polar amino acids typically reside on the exterior or surface of proteins, which have a significant degree of solvent accessibility. Thus at variable surface positions it may be beneficial to consider only or mostly polar amino acids such as alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine and histidine. Some positions are partly exposed and partly buried, and are not clearly protein core or surface positions, in a sense serving as boundary residues between core and surface residues. Thus at such variable boundary positions it may be beneficial to consider both nonpolar and polar amino acids such as alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine histidine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine. Determination of the degree of solvent exposure at variable positions may be by subjective evaluation or visual inspection of the template structure by one skilled in the art of protein structural biology, or by using a variety of algorithms that are known in the art. Selection of amino acid types to be considered at variable positions may be aided or determined wholly by computational methods, such as calculation of solvent accessible surface area, or using algorithms that assess the orientation of the Cα-Cβ vectors relative to a solvent accessible surface, as outlined in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,188,965; 6,269,312; U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. No. 09/782,004; U.S. Ser. No. 09/927,790; U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588. In one embodiment, each variable position may be classified explicitly as a core, surface, or boundary position or a classification substantially similar to core, surface, or boundary.\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, selection of the set of amino acids allowed at variable positions may be hypothesis-driven. Hypotheses for which amino acid types should be considered at variable positions may be derived by a subjective evaluation or visual inspection of the template structure by one skilled in the art of protein structural biology. For example, if it is suspected that a hydrogen bonding interaction may be favorable at a variable position, polar residues that have the capacity to form hydrogen bonds may be considered, even if the position is in the core. Likewise, if it is suspected that a hydrophobic packing interaction may be favorable at a variable position, nonpolar residues that have the capacity to form favorable packing interactions may be considered, even if the position is on the surface. Other examples of hypothesis-driven approaches may involve issues of backbone flexibility or protein fold. As is known in the art, certain residues, for example proline, glycine, and cysteine, play important roles in protein structure and stability. Glycine enables greater backbone flexibility than all other amino acids, proline constrains the backbone more than all other amino acids, and cysteines may form disulfide bonds. It may therefore be beneficial to include one or more of these amino acid types to achieve a desired design goal. Alternatively, it may be beneficial to exclude one or more of these amino acid types from the list of considered amino acids.\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, subsets of amino acids may be chosen to maximize coverage. In this case, additional amino acids with properties similar to that in the template structure may be considered at variable positions. For example, if the residue at a variable position in the template structure is a large hydrophobic residue, additional large hydrophobic amino acids may be considered at that position. Alternatively, subsets of amino acids may be chosen to maximize diversity. In this case, amino acids with properties dissimilar to those in the template structure may be considered at variable positions. For example, if the residue at a variable position in the template is a large hydrophobic residue, amino acids that are small, polar, etc. may be considered.\n\n\nAs is known in the art, some computational screening methods require only the identity of considered amino acids to be determined during design calculations. That is, no information is required concerning the conformations or possible conformations of the amino acid side chains. Other preferred methods utilize a set of discrete side chain conformations, called rotamers, which are considered for each amino acid. Thus, a set of rotamers may be considered at each variable and floated position. Rotamers may be obtained from published rotamer libraries (see for example, Lovel et al., 2000\n, Proteins: Structure Function and Genetics \n40:389-408; Dunbrack & Cohen, 1997\n, Protein Science \n6:1661-1681; DeMaeyer et al., 1997\n, Folding and Design \n2:53-66; Tuffery et al., 1991\n, J Biomol Struct Dyn \n8:1267-1289, Ponder & Richards, 1987\n, J Mol Biol \n193:775-791). As is known in the art, rotamer libraries may be backbone-independent or backbone-dependent. Rotamers may also be obtained from molecular mechanics or ab initio calculations, and using other methods. In a preferred embodiment, a flexible rotamer model is used (see Mendes et al., 1999\n, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics \n37:530-543). Similarly, artificially generated rotamers may be used, or augment the set chosen for each amino acid and/or variable position. In one embodiment, at least one conformation that is not low in energy is included in the list of rotamers. In an alternate embodiment, the rotamer of the variable position residue in the template structure is included in the list of rotamers allowed for that variable position. In an alternate embodiment, only the identity of each amino acid considered at variable positions is provided, and no specific conformational states of each amino acid are used during design calculations. That is, use of rotamers is not essential for computational screening.\n\n\nExperimental information may be used to guide the choice of variable positions and/or the choice of considered amino acids at variable positions. As is known in the art, mutagenesis experiments are often carried out to determine the role of certain residues in protein structure and function, for example, which protein residues play a role in determining stability, or which residues make up the interface of a protein-protein interaction. Data obtained from such experiments are useful in the present invention. For example, variable positions for Fc/FcγR affinity enhancement could involve varying all positions at which mutation has been shown to affect binding. Similarly, the results from such an experiment may be used to guide the choice of allowed amino acid types at variable positions. For example, if certain types of amino acid substitutions are found to be favorable, similar types of those amino acids may be considered. In one embodiment, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that were found to be favorable experimentally may be considered at variable positions. For example, if experimental mutation of a variable position at an Fc/FcγR interface to a large hydrophobic residue was found to be favorable, the user may choose to include additional large hydrophobic amino acids at that position in the computational screen. As is known in the art, display and other selection technologies may be coupled with random mutagenesis to generate a list or lists of amino acid substitutions that are favorable for the selected property. Such a list or lists obtained from such experimental work find use in the present invention. For example, positions that are found to be invariable in such an experiment may be excluded as variable positions in computational screening calculations, whereas positions that are found to be more acceptable to mutation or respond favorably to mutation may be chosen as variable positions. Similarly, the results from such experiments may be used to guide the choice of allowed amino acid types at variable positions. For example, if certain types of amino acids arise more frequently in an experimental selection, similar types of those amino acids may be considered. In one embodiment, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that were found to be favorable experimentally may be considered at variable positions. For example, if selected mutations at a variable position that resides at an Fc/FcγR interface are found to be uncharged polar amino acids, the user may choose to include additional uncharged polar amino acids, or perhaps charged polar amino acids, at that position.\n\n\nSequence information may also be used to guide choice of variable positions and/or the choice of amino acids considered at variable positions. As is known in the art, some proteins share a common structural scaffold and are homologous in sequence. This information may be used to gain insight into particular positions in the protein family. As is known in the art, sequence alignments are often carried out to determine which protein residues are conserved and which are not conserved. That is to say, by comparing and contrasting alignments of protein sequences, the degree of variability at a position may be observed, and the types of amino acids that occur naturally at positions may be observed. Data obtained from such analyses are useful in the present invention. The benefit of using sequence information to choose variable positions and considered amino acids at variable positions are several fold. For choice of variable positions, the primary advantage of using sequence information is that insight may be gained into which positions are more tolerant and which are less tolerant to mutation. Thus sequence information may aid in ensuring that quality diversity, i.e. mutations that are not deleterious to protein structure, stability, etc., is sampled computationally. The same advantage applies to use of sequence information to select amino acid types considered at variable positions. That is, the set of amino acids that occur in a protein sequence alignment may be thought of as being pre-screened by evolution to have a higher chance than random for being compatible with a protein's structure, stability, solubility, function, etc. Thus higher quality diversity is sampled computationally. A second benefit of using sequence information to select amino acid types considered at variable positions is that certain alignments may represent sequences that may be less immunogenic than random sequences. For example, if the amino acids considered at a given variable position are the set of amino acids which occur at that position in an alignment of human protein sequences, those amino acids may be thought of as being pre-screened by nature for generating no or low immune response if the optimized protein is used as a human therapeutic.\n\n\nThe source of the sequences may vary widely, and include one or more of the known databases, including but not limited to the Kabat database (Johnson & Wu, 2001\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n29:205-206; Johnson & Wu, 2000\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n28:214-218), the IMGT database (IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics information System®; Lefranc et al., 1999\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n27:209-212; Ruiz et al., 2000 \nNucleic Acids Re. \n28:219-221; Lefranc et al., 2001\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n29:207-209; Lefranc et al., 2003\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n31:307-310), and VBASE, SwissProt, GenBank and Entrez, and EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database. Protein sequence information can be obtained, compiled, and/or generated from sequence alignments of naturally occurring proteins from any organism, including but not limited to mammals. Protein sequence information can be obtained from a database that is compiled privately. There are numerous sequence-based alignment programs and methods known in the art, and all of these find use in the present invention for generation of sequence alignments of proteins that comprise Fc and Fc ligands.\n\n\nOnce alignments are made, sequence information can be used to guide choice of variable positions. Such sequence information can relate the variability, natural or otherwise, of a given position. Variability herein should be distinguished from variable position. Variability refers to the degree to which a given position in a sequence alignment shows variation in the types of amino acids that occur there. Variable position, to reiterate, is a position chosen by the user to vary in amino acid identity during a computational screening calculation. Variability may be determined qualitatively by one skilled in the art of bioinformatics. There are also methods known in the art to quantitatively determine variability that may find use in the present invention. The most preferred embodiment measures Information Entropy or Shannon Entropy. Variable positions can be chosen based on sequence information obtained from closely related protein sequences, or sequences that are less closely related.\n\n\nThe use of sequence information to choose variable positions finds broad use in the present invention. For example, if an Fc/FcγR interface position in the template structure is tryptophan, and tryptophan is observed at that position in greater than 90% of the sequences in an alignment, it may be beneficial to leave that position fixed. In contrast, if another interface position is found to have a greater level of variability, for example if five different amino acids are observed at that position with frequencies of approximately 20% each, that position may be chosen as a variable position. In another embodiment, visual inspection of aligned protein sequences may substitute for or aid visual inspection of a protein structure. Sequence information can also be used to guide the choice of amino acids considered at variable positions. Such sequence information can relate to how frequently an amino acid, amino acids, or amino acid types (for example polar or nonpolar, charged or uncharged) occur, naturally or otherwise, at a given position. In one embodiment, the set of amino acids considered at a variable position may comprise the set of amino acids that is observed at that position in the alignment. Thus, the position-specific alignment information is used directly to generate the list of considered amino acids at a variable position in a computational screening calculation. Such a strategy is well known in the art; see for example Lehmann & Wyss, 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n12(4):371-5; Lehmann et al., 2000\n, Biochim Biophys Acta \n1543(2):408-415; Rath & Davidson, 2000\n, Protein Sci, \n9(12):2457-69; Lehmann et al., 2000\n, Protein Eng \n13(1):49-57; Desjarlais & Berg, 1993\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n90(6):2256-60; Desjarlais & Berg, 1992\n, Proteins \n12(2):101-4; Henikoff & Henikoff, 2000\n, Adv Protein Chem \n54:73-97; Henikoff & Henikoff, 1994\n, J Mol Biol \n243(4):574-8. In an alternate embodiment, the set of amino acids considered at a variable position or positions may comprise a set of amino acids that is observed most frequently in the alignment. Thus, a certain criteria is applied to determine whether the frequency of an amino acid or amino acid type warrants its inclusion in the set of amino acids that are considered at a variable position. As is known in the art, sequence alignments may be analyzed using statistical methods to calculate the sequence diversity at any position in the alignment and the occurrence frequency or probability of each amino acid at a position. Such data may then be used to determine which amino acids types to consider. In the simplest embodiment, these occurrence frequencies are calculated by counting the number of times an amino acid is observed at an alignment position, then dividing by the total number of sequences in the alignment. In other embodiments, the contribution of each sequence, position or amino acid to the counting procedure is weighted by a variety of possible mechanisms. In a preferred embodiment, the contribution of each aligned sequence to the frequency statistics is weighted according to its diversity weighting relative to other sequences in the alignment. A common strategy for accomplishing this is the sequence weighting system recommended by Henikoff and Henikoff (Henikoff & Henikoff, 2000\n, Adv Protein Chem \n54:73-97; Henikoff & Henikoff, 1994\n, J Mol Biol \n243:574-8. In a preferred embodiment, the contribution of each sequence to the statistics is dependent on its extent of similarity to the target sequence, i.e. the template structure used, such that sequences with higher similarity to the target sequence are weighted more highly. Examples of similarity measures include, but are not limited to, sequence identity, BLOSUM similarity score, PAM matrix similarity score, and BLAST score. In an alternate embodiment, the contribution of each sequence to the statistics is dependent on its known physical or functional properties. These properties include, but are not limited to, thermal and chemical stability, contribution to activity, and solubility. For example, when optimizing aglycosylated Fc for solubility, those sequences in an alignment that are known to be most soluble (for example see Ewert et al., 2003\n, J Mol Biol \n325:531-553), will contribute more heavily to the calculated frequencies.\n\n\nRegardless of what criteria are applied for choosing the set of amino acids in a sequence alignment to be considered at variable positions, use of sequence information to choose considered amino acids finds broad use in the present invention. For example, to optimize Fc solubility by replacing exposed nonpolar surface residues, considered amino acids may be chosen as the set of amino acids, or a subset of those amino acids which meet some criteria, that are observed at that position in an alignment of protein sequences. As another example, one or more amino acids may be added or subtracted subjectively from a list of amino acids derived from a sequence alignment in order to maximize coverage. For example, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that are found in a sequence alignment may be considered at variable positions. For example, if an Fc position that is known to or hypothesized to bind an FcγR is observed to have uncharged polar amino acids in a sequence alignment, the user may choose to include additional uncharged polar amino acids in a computational screening calculation, or perhaps charged polar amino acids, at that position.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, sequence alignment information is combined with energy calculation, as discussed below. For example, pseudo energies can be derived from sequence information to generate a scoring function. The use of a sequence-based scoring function may assist in significantly reducing the complexity of a calculation. However, as is appreciated by those skilled in the art, the use of a sequence-based scoring function alone may be inadequate because sequence information can often indicate misleading correlations between mutations that may in reality be structurally conflicting. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, a structure-based method of energy calculation is used, either alone or in combination with a sequence-based scoring function. That is, preferred embodiments do not rely on sequence alignment information alone as the analysis step.\n\n\nEnergy calculation refers to the process by which amino acid modifications are scored. The energies of interaction are measured by one or more scoring functions. A variety of scoring functions find use in the present invention for calculating energies. Scoring functions may include any number of potentials, herein referred to as the energy terms of a scoring function, including but not limited to a van der Waals potential, a hydrogen bond potential, an atomic solvation potential or other solvation models, a secondary structure propensity potential, an electrostatic potential, a torsional potential, and an entropy potential. At least one energy term is used to score each variable or floated position, although the energy terms may differ depending on the position, considered amino acids, and other considerations. In one embodiment, a scoring function using one energy term is used. In the most preferred embodiment, energies are calculated using a scoring function that contains more than one energy term, for example describing van der Waals, salvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions, and combinations thereof. In additional embodiments, additional energy terms include but are not limited to entropic terms, torsional energies, and knowledge-based energies.\n\n\nA variety of scoring functions are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,188,965; U.S. Pat. No. 6,269,312; U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. No. 09/782,004; U.S. Ser. No. 09/927,790; U.S. Ser. No. 09/877,695; U.S. Ser. No. 10/071,859, U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, scoring functions need not be limited to physico-chemical energy terms. For example, knowledge-based potentials may find use in the computational screening methodology of the present invention. Such knowledge-based potentials may be derived from protein sequence and/or structure statistics including but not limited to threading potentials, reference energies, pseudo energies, homology-based energies, and sequence biases derived from sequence alignments. In a preferred embodiment, a scoring function is modified to include models for immunogenicity, such as functions derived from data on binding of peptides to MHC (Major Htocompatability Complex), that may be used to identify potentially immunogenic sequences (see for example U.S. Ser. No. 09/903,378; U.S. Ser. No. 10/039,170; U.S. Ser. No. 60/222,697; U.S. Ser. No. 10/339,788; PCT WO 01/21823; and PCT WO 02/00165). In one embodiment, sequence alignment information can be used to score amino acid substitutions. For example, comparison of protein sequences, regardless of whether the source of said proteins is human, monkey, mouse, or otherwise, may be used to suggest or score amino acid mutations in the computational screening methodology of the present invention. In one embodiment, as is known in the art, one or more scoring functions may be optimized or “trained” during the computational analysis, and then the analysis re-run using the optimized system. Such altered scoring functions may be obtained for example, by training a scoring function using experimental data. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a number of force fields, which are comprised of one or more energy terms, may serve as scoring functions. Force fields include but are not limited to ab initio or quantum mechanical force fields, semi-empirical force fields, and molecular mechanics force fields. Scoring functions that are knowledge-based or that use statistical methods may find use in the present invention. These methods may be used to assess the match between a sequence and a three-dimensional protein structure, and hence may be used to score amino acid substitutions for fidelity to the protein structure. In one embodiment, molecular dynamics calculations may be used to computationally screen sequences by individually calculating mutant sequence scores.\n\n\nThere are a variety of ways to represent amino acids in order to enable efficient energy calculation. In a preferred embodiment, considered amino acids are represented as rotamers, as described previously, and the energy (or score) of interaction of each possible rotamer at each variable and floated position with the other variable and floated rotamers, with fixed position residues, and with the backbone structure and any non-protein atoms, is calculated. In a preferred embodiment, two sets of interaction energies are calculated for each side chain rotamer at every variable and floated position: the interaction energy between the rotamer and the fixed atoms (the “singles” energy), and the interaction energy between the variable and floated positions rotamer and all other possible rotamers at every other variable and floated position (the “doubles” energy). In an alternate embodiment, singles and doubles energies are calculated for fixed positions as well as for variable and floated positions. In an alternate embodiment, considered amino acids are not represented as rotamers.\n\n\nAn important component of computational screening is the identification of one or more sequences that have a favorable score, i.e. are low in energy. Determining a set of low energy sequences from an extremely large number of possibilities is nontrivial, and to solve this problem a combinatorial optimization algorithm is employed. The need for a combinatorial optimization algorithm is illustrated by examining the number of possibilities that are considered in a typical computational screening calculation. The discrete nature of rotamer sets allows a simple calculation of the number of possible rotameric sequences for a given design problem. A backbone of length n with m possible rotamers per position will have m\nn \npossible rotamer sequences, a number that grows exponentially with sequence length. For very simple calculations, it is possible to examine each possible sequence in order to identify the optimal sequence and/or one or more favorable sequences. However, for a typical design problem, the number of possible sequences (up to 10\n80 \nor more) is sufficiently large that examination of each possible sequence is intractable. A variety of combinatorial optimization algorithms may then be used to identify the optimum sequence and/or one or more favorable sequences. Combinatorial optimization algorithms may be divided into two classes: (1) those that are guaranteed to return the global minimum energy configuration if they converge, and (2) those that are not guaranteed to return the global minimum energy configuration, but which will always return a solution. Examples of the first class of algorithms include but are not limited to Dead-End Elimination (DEE) and Branch & Bound (B&B) (including Branch and Terminate) (Gordon & Mayo, 1999\n, Structure Fold Des \n7:1089-98). Examples of the second class of algorithms include, but are not limited to, Monte Carlo (MC), self-consistent mean field (SCMF), Boltzmann sampling (Metropolis et al., 1953\n, J Chem Phys \n21:1087), simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983\n, Science, \n220:671-680), genetic algorithm (GA), and Fast and Accurate Side-Chain Topology and Energy Refinement (FASTER) (Desmet, et al., 2002\n, Proteins, \n48:31-43). A combinatorial optimization algorithm may be used alone or in conjunction with another combinatorial optimization algorithm.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the strategy for applying a combinatorial optimization algorithm is to find the global minimum energy configuration. In an alternate embodiment, the strategy is to find one or more low energy or favorable sequences. In an alternate embodiment, the strategy is to find the global minimum energy configuration and then find one or more low energy or favorable sequences. For example, as outlined in U.S. Pat. No. 6,269,312, preferred embodiments utilize a Dead End Elimination (DEE) step and a Monte Carlo step. In other embodiments, tabu search algorithms are used or combined with DEE and/or Monte Carlo, among other search methods (see Modern Heuristic Search Methods, edited by V. J. Rayward-Smith et al., 1996, John Wiley & Sons Ltd.; U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102; and PCT WO 02/25588). In another preferred embodiment, a genetic algorithm may be used; see for example U.S. Ser. No. 09/877,695 and U.S. Ser. No. 10/071,859. As another example, as is more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,188,965; U.S. Pat. No. 6,269,312; U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. No. 09/782,004; U.S. Ser. No. 09/927,790; U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588, the global optimum may be reached, and then further computational processing may occur, which generates additional optimized sequences. In the simplest embodiment, design calculations are not combinatorial. That is, energy calculations are used to evaluate amino acid substitutions individually at single variable positions. For other calculations it is preferred to evaluate amino acid substitutions at more than one variable position. In a preferred embodiment, all possible interaction energies are calculated prior to combinatorial optimization. In an alternatively preferred embodiment, energies may be calculated as needed during combinatorial optimization.\n\n\nLibrary Generation\n\n\nThe present invention provides methods for generating libraries that may subsequently be screened experimentally to single out optimized Fc variants. By “library” as used herein is meant a set of one or more Fc variants. Library may refer to the set of variants in any form. In one embodiment, the library is a list of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, or a list of nucleic acid or amino acid substitutions at variable positions. For example, the examples used to illustrate the present invention below provide libraries as amino acid substitutions at variable positions. In one embodiment, a library is a list of at least one sequence that are Fc variants optimized for a desired property. For example see, Filikov et al., 2002\n, Protein Sci \n11: 1452-1461 and Luo et al., 2002\n, Protein Sci \n11:1218-1226. In an alternate embodiment, a library may be defined as a combinatorial list, meaning that a list of amino acid substitutions is generated for each variable position, with the implication that each substitution is to be combined with all other designed substitutions at all other variable positions. In this case, expansion of the combination of all possibilities at all variable positions results in a large explicitly defined library. A library may refer to a physical composition of polypeptides that comprise the Fc region or some domain or fragment of the Fc region. Thus a library may refer to a physical composition of antibodies or Fc fusions, either in purified or unpurified form. A library may refer to a physical composition of nucleic acids that encode the library sequences. Said nucleic acids may be the genes encoding the library members, the genes encoding the library members with any operably linked nucleic acids, or expression vectors encoding the library members together with any other operably linked regulatory sequences, selectable markers, fusion constructs, and/or other elements. For example, the library may be a set of mammalian expression vectors that encode Fc library members, the protein products of which may be subsequently expressed, purified, and screened experimentally. As another example, the library may be a display library. Such a library could, for example, comprise a set of expression vectors that encode library members operably linked to some fusion partner that enables phage display, ribosome display, yeast display, bacterial surface display, and the like.\n\n\nThe library may be generated using the output sequence or sequences from computational screening. As discussed above, computationally generated libraries are significantly enriched in stable, properly folded, and functional sequences relative to randomly generated libraries. As a result, computational screening increases the chances of identifying proteins that are optimized for the design goal. The set of sequences in a library is generally, but not always, significantly different from the parent sequence, although in some cases the library preferably contains the parent sequence. As is known in the art, there are a variety of ways that a library may be derived from the output of computational screening calculations. For example, methods of library generation described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. No. 09/782,004; U.S. Ser. No. 09/927,790; U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588 find use in the present invention. In one embodiment, sequences scoring within a certain range of the global optimum sequence may be included in the library. For example, all sequences within 10 kcal/mol of the lowest energy sequence could be used as the library. In an alternate embodiment, sequences scoring within a certain range of one or more local minima sequences may be used. In a preferred embodiment, the library sequences are obtained from a filtered set. Such a list or set may be generated by a variety of methods, as is known in the art, for example using an algorithm such as Monte Carlo, B&B, or SCMF. For example, the top 10\n3 \nor the top 10\n5 \nsequences in the filtered set may comprise the library. Alternatively, the total number of sequences defined by the combination of all mutations may be used as a cutoff criterion for the library. Preferred values for the total number of recombined sequences range from 10 to 10\n20\n, particularly preferred values range from 100 to 10\n9\n. Alternatively, a cutoff may be enforced when a predetermined number of mutations per position is reached. In some embodiments, sequences that do not make the cutoff are included in the library. This may be desirable in some situations, for instance to evaluate the approach to library generation, to provide controls or comparisons, or to sample additional sequence space. For example, the parent sequence may be included in the library, even if it does not make the cutoff.\n\n\nClustering algorithms may be useful for classifying sequences derived by computational screening methods into representative groups. For example, the methods of clustering and their application described in U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102 and PCT WO 02/25588, find use in the present invention. Representative groups may be defined, for example, by similarity. Measures of similarity include, but are not limited to sequence similarity and energetic similarity. Thus the output sequences from computational screening may be clustered around local minima, referred to herein as clustered sets of sequences. For example, sets of sequences that are close in sequence space may be distinguished from other sets. In one embodiment, coverage within one or a subset of clustered sets may be maximized by including in the library some, most, or all of the sequences that make up one or more clustered sets of sequences. For example, it may be advantageous to maximize coverage within the one, two, or three lowest energy clustered sets by including the majority of sequences within these sets in the library. In an alternate embodiment, diversity across clustered sets of sequences may be sampled by including within a library only a subset of sequences within each clustered set. For example, all or most of the clustered sets could be broadly sampled by including the lowest energy sequence from each clustered set in the library.\n\n\nSequence information may be used to guide or filter computationally screening results for generation of a library. As discussed, by comparing and contrasting alignments of protein sequences, the degree of variability at a position and the types of amino acids which occur naturally at that position may be observed. Data obtained from such analyses are useful in the present invention. The benefits of using sequence information have been discussed, and those benefits apply equally to use of sequence information to guide library generation. The set of amino acids that occur in a sequence alignment may be thought of as being pre-screened by evolution to have a higher chance than random at being compatible with a protein's structure, stability, solubility, function, and immunogenicity. The variety of sequence sources, as well as the methods for generating sequence alignments that have been discussed, find use in the application of sequence information to guiding library generation. Likewise, as discussed above, various criteria may be applied to determine the importance or weight of certain residues in an alignment. These methods also find use in the application of sequence information to guide library generation. Using sequence information to guide library generation from the results of computational screening finds broad use in the present invention. In one embodiment, sequence information is used to filter sequences from computational screening output. That is to say, some substitutions are subtracted from the computational output to generate the library. For example the resulting output of a computational screening calculation or calculations may be filtered so that the library includes only those amino acids, or a subset of those amino acids that meet some criteria, for example that are observed at that position in an alignment of sequences. In an alternate embodiment, sequence information is used to add sequences to the computational screening output. That is to say, sequence information is used to guide the choice of additional amino acids that are added to the computational output to generate the library. For example, the output set of amino acids for a given position from a computational screening calculation may be augmented to include one or more amino acids that are observed at that position in an alignment of protein sequences. In an alternate embodiment, based on sequence alignment information, one or more amino acids may be added to or subtracted from the computational screening sequence output in order to maximize coverage or diversity. For example, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that are found in a sequence alignment may be added to the library. For example, if a position is observed to have uncharged polar amino acids in a sequence alignment, additional uncharged polar amino acids may be included in the library at that position.\n\n\nLibraries may be processed further to generate subsequent libraries. In this way, the output from a computational screening calculation or calculations may be thought of as a primary library. This primary library may be combined with other primary libraries from other calculations or other libraries, processed using subsequent calculations, sequence information, or other analyses, or processed experimentally to generate a subsequent library, herein referred to as a secondary library. As will be appreciated from this description, the use of sequence information to guide or filter libraries, discussed above, is itself one method of generating secondary libraries from primary libraries. Generation of secondary libraries gives the user greater control of the parameters within a library. This enables more efficient experimental screening, and may allow feedback from experimental results to be interpreted more easily, providing a more efficient design/experimentation cycle.\n\n\nThere are a wide variety of methods to generate secondary libraries from primary libraries. For example, U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102 and PCT WO 02/25588, describes methods for secondary library generation that find use in the present invention. Typically some selection step occurs in which a primary library is processed in some way. For example, in one embodiment a selection step occurs wherein some set of primary sequences are chosen to form the secondary library. In an alternate embodiment, a selection step is a computational step, again generally including a selection step, wherein some subset of the primary library is chosen and then subjected to further computational analysis, including both further computational screening as well as techniques such as “in silico” shuffling or recombination (see, for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,721; U.S. Pat. No. 5,811,238; U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,793; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,458, error-prone PCR, for example using modified nucleotides; known mutagenesis techniques including the use of multi-cassettes; and DNA shuffling (Crameri et al., 1998\n, Nature \n391:288-291; Coco et al., 2001\n, Nat Biotechnol \n19:354-9; Coco et al., 2002\n, Nat Biotechnol, \n20:1246-50), heterogeneous DNA samples (U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,250); ITCHY (Ostermeier et al., 1999\n, Nat Biotechnol \n17:1205-1209); StEP (Zhao et al., 1998\n, Nat Biotechnol \n16:258-261), GSSM (U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,820 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,965,408); in vivo homologous recombination, ligase assisted gene assembly, end-complementary PCR, profusion (Roberts & Szostak, 1997\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n94:12297-12302); yeast/bacteria surface display (Lu et al., 1995\n, Biotechnology \n13:366-372); Seed & Aruffo, 1987\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n84(10):3365-3369; Boder & Wittrup, 1997\n, Nat Biotechnol \n15:553-557). In an alternate embodiment, a selection step occurs that is an experimental step, for example any of the library screening steps below, wherein some subset of the primary library is chosen and then recombined experimentally, for example using one of the directed evolution methods discussed below, to form a secondary library. In a preferred embodiment, the primary library is generated and processed as outlined in U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,312.\n\n\nGeneration of secondary and subsequent libraries finds broad use in the present invention. In one embodiment, different primary libraries may be combined to generate a secondary or subsequent library. In another embodiment, secondary libraries may be generated by sampling sequence diversity at highly mutatable or highly conserved positions. The primary library may be analyzed to determine which amino acid positions in the template protein have high mutational frequency, and which positions have low mutational frequency. For example, positions in a protein that show a great deal of mutational diversity in computational screening may be fixed in a subsequent round of design calculations. A filtered set of the same size as the first would now show diversity at positions that were largely conserved in the first library. Alternatively, the secondary library may be generated by varying the amino acids at the positions that have high numbers of mutations, while keeping constant the positions that do not have mutations above a certain frequency.\n\n\nThis discussion is not meant to constrain generation of libraries subsequent to primary libraries to secondary libraries. As will be appreciated, primary and secondary libraries may be processed further to generate tertiary libraries, quaternary libraries, and so on. In this way, library generation is an iterative process. For example, tertiary libraries may be constructed using a variety of additional steps applied to one or more secondary libraries; for example, further computational processing may occur, secondary libraries may be recombined, or subsets of different secondary libraries may be combined. In a preferred embodiment, a tertiary library may be generated by combining secondary libraries. For example, primary and/or secondary libraries that analyzed different parts of a protein may be combined to generate a tertiary library that treats the combined parts of the protein. In an alternate embodiment, the variants from a primary library may be combined with the variants from another primary library to provide a combined tertiary library at lower computational cost than creating a very long filtered set. These combinations may be used, for example, to analyze large proteins, especially large multi-domain proteins, of which Fc is an example. Thus the above description of secondary library generation applies to generating any library subsequent to a primary library, the end result being a final library that may screened experimentally to obtain protein variants optimized for a design goal. These examples are not meant to constrain generation of secondary libraries to any particular application or theory of operation for the present invention. Rather, these examples are meant to illustrate that generation of secondary libraries, and subsequent libraries such as tertiary libraries and so on, is broadly useful in computational screening methodology for library generation.\n\n\nExperimental Production and Screening\n\n\nThe present invention provides methods for producing and screening libraries of Fc variants. The described methods are not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular application or theory of operation. Rather, the provided methods are meant to illustrate generally that one or more Fc variants or one or more libraries of Fc variants may be produced and screened experimentally to obtain optimized Fc variants. Fc variants may be produced and screened in any context, whether as an Fc region as precisely defined herein, a domain or fragment thereof, or a larger polypeptide that comprises Fc such as an antibody or Fc fusion. General methods for antibody molecular biology, expression, purification, and screening are described in Antibody Engineering, edited by Duebel & Kontermann, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, 2001; and Hayhurst & Georgiou, 2001\n, Curr Opin Chem Biol \n5:683-689; Maynard & Georgiou, 2000\n, Annu Rev Biomed Eng \n2:339-76; Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual by Harlow & Lane, New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the library sequences are used to create nucleic acids that encode the member sequences, and that may then be cloned into host cells, expressed and assayed, if desired. Thus, nucleic acids, and particularly DNA, may be made that encode each member protein sequence. These practices are carried out using well-known procedures. For example, a variety of methods that may find use in the present invention are described in Molecular Cloning—A Laboratory Manual, 3\nrd \nEd. (Maniatis, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 2001), and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (John Wiley & Sons). As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the generation of exact sequences for a library comprising a large number of sequences is potentially expensive and time consuming. Accordingly, there are a variety of techniques that may be used to efficiently generate libraries of the present invention. Such methods that may find use in the present invention are described or referenced in U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. No. 09/782,004; U.S. Ser. No. 09/927,790; U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588. Such methods include but are not limited to gene assembly methods, PCR-based method and methods which use variations of PCR, ligase chain reaction-based methods, pooled oligo methods such as those used in synthetic shuffling, error-prone amplification methods and methods which use oligos with random mutations, classical site-directed mutagenesis methods, cassette mutagenesis, and other amplification and gene synthesis methods. As is known in the art, there are a variety of commercially available kits and methods for gene assembly, mutagenesis, vector subcloning, and the like, and such commercial products find use in the present invention for generating nucleic acids that encode Fc variant members of a library.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be produced by culturing a host cell transformed with nucleic acid, preferably an expression vector, containing nucleic acid encoding the Fc variants, under the appropriate conditions to induce or cause expression of the protein. The conditions appropriate for expression will vary with the choice of the expression vector and the host cell, and will be easily ascertained by one skilled in the art through routine experimentation. A wide variety of appropriate host cells may be used, including but not limited to mammalian cells, bacteria, insect cells, and yeast. For example, a variety of cell lines that may find use in the present invention are described in the ATCC® cell line catalog, available from the American Type Culture Collection.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants are expressed in mammalian expression systems, including systems in which the expression constructs are introduced into the mammalian cells using virus such as retrovirus or adenovirus. Any mammalian cells may be used, with human, mouse, rat, hamster, and primate cells being particularly preferred. Suitable cells also include known research cells, including but not limited to Jurkat T cells, NIH3T3, CHO, COS, and 293 cells. In an alternately preferred embodiment, library proteins are expressed in bacterial cells. Bacterial expression systems are well known in the art, and include \nEscherichia coli \n(\nE. coli\n), \nBacillus subtilis, Streptococcus cremoris\n, and \nStreptococcus lividans\n. In alternate embodiments, Fc variants are produced in insect cells or yeast cells. In an alternate embodiment, Fc variants are expressed in vitro using cell free translation systems. In vitro translation systems derived from both prokaryotic (e.g. \nE. coli\n) and eukaryotic (e.g. wheat germ, rabbit reticulocytes) cells are available and may be chosen based on the expression levels and functional properties of the protein of interest. For example, as appreciated by those skilled in the art, in vitro translation is required for some display technologies, for example ribosome display. In addition, the Fc variants may be produced by chemical synthesis methods.\n\n\nThe nucleic acids that encode the Fc variants of the present invention may be incorporated into an expression vector in order to express the protein. A variety of expression vectors may be utilized for protein expression. Expression vectors may comprise self-replicating extra-chromosomal vectors or vectors which integrate into a host genome. Expression vectors are constructed to be compatible with the host cell type. Thus expression vectors which find use in the present invention include but are not limited to those which enable protein expression in mammalian cells, bacteria, insect cells, yeast, and in in vitro systems. As is known in the art, a variety of expression vectors are available, commercially or otherwise, that may find use in the present invention for expressing Fc variant proteins.\n\n\nExpression vectors typically comprise a protein operably linked with control or regulatory sequences, selectable markers, any fusion partners, and/or additional elements. By “operably linked” herein is meant that the nucleic acid is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. Generally, these expression vectors include transcriptional and translational regulatory nucleic acid operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the Fc variant, and are typically appropriate to the host cell used to express the protein. In general, the transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences may include promoter sequences, ribosomal binding sites, transcriptional start and stop sequences, translational start and stop sequences, and enhancer or activator sequences. As is also known in the art, expression vectors typically contain a selection gene or marker to allow the selection of transformed host cells containing the expression vector. Selection genes are well known in the art and will vary with the host cell used.\n\n\nFc variants may be operably linked to a fusion partner to enable targeting of the expressed protein, purification, screening, display, and the like. Fusion partners may be linked to the Fc variant sequence via a linker sequences. The linker sequence will generally comprise a small number of amino acids, typically less than ten, although longer linkers may also be used. Typically, linker sequences are selected to be flexible and resistant to degradation. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, any of a wide variety of sequences may be used as linkers. For example, a common linker sequence comprises the amino acid sequence GGGGS. A fusion partner may be a targeting or signal sequence that directs Fc variant protein and any associated fusion partners to a desired cellular location or to the extracellular media. As is known in the art, certain signaling sequences may target a protein to be either secreted into the growth media, or into the periplasmic space, located between the inner and outer membrane of the cell. A fusion partner may also be a sequence that encodes a peptide or protein that enables purification and/or screening. Such fusion partners include but are not limited to polyhistidine tags (His-tags) (for example H\n6 \nand H\n10 \nor other tags for use with Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) systems (e.g. Ni\n+2 \naffinity columns)), GST fusions, MBP fusions, Strep-tag, the BSP biotinylation target sequence of the bacterial enzyme BirA, and epitope tags which are targeted by antibodies (for example c-myc tags, flag-tags, and the like). As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, such tags may be useful for purification, for screening, or both. For example, an Fc variant may be purified using a His-tag by immobilizing it to a Ni\n+2 \naffinity column, and then after purification the same His-tag may be used to immobilize the antibody to a Ni\n+2 \ncoated plate to perform an ELISA or other binding assay (as described below). A fusion partner may enable the use of a selection method to screen Fc variants (see below). Fusion partners that enable a variety of selection methods are well-known in the art, and all of these find use in the present invention. For example, by fusing the members of an Fc variant library to the gene III protein, phage display can be employed (Kay et al., Phage display of peptides and proteins: a laboratory manual, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1996; Lowman et al., 1991\n, Biochemistry \n30:10832-10838; Smith, 1985\n, Science \n228:1315-1317). Fusion partners may enable Fc variants to be labeled. Alternatively, a fusion partner may bind to a specific sequence on the expression vector, enabling the fusion partner and associated Fc variant to be linked covalently or noncovalently with the nucleic acid that encodes them. For example, U.S. Ser. No. 09/642,574; U.S. Ser. No. 10/080,376; U.S. Ser. No. 09/792,630; U.S. Ser. No. 10/023,208; U.S. Ser. No. 09/792,626; U.S. Ser. No. 10/082,671; U.S. Ser. No. 09/953,351; U.S. Ser. No. 10/097,100; U.S. Ser. No. 60/366,658; PCT WO 00/22906; PCT WO 01/49058; PCT WO 02/04852; PCT WO 02/04853; PCT WO 02/08023; PCT WO 01/28702; and PCT WO 02/07466 describe such a fusion partner and technique that may find use in the present invention.\n\n\nThe methods of introducing exogenous nucleic acid into host cells are well known in the art, and will vary with the host cell used. Techniques include but are not limited to dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, calcium chloride treatment, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, viral or phage infection, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei. In the case of mammalian cells, transfection may be either transient or stable.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, Fc variant proteins are purified or isolated after expression. Proteins may be isolated or purified in a variety of ways known to those skilled in the art. Standard purification methods include chromatographic techniques, including ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, affinity, sizing or gel filtration, and reversed-phase, carried out at atmospheric pressure or at high pressure using systems such as FPLC and HPLC. Purification methods also include electrophoretic, immunological, precipitation, dialysis, and chromatofocusing techniques. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration techniques, in conjunction with protein concentration, are also useful. As is well known in the art, a variety of natural proteins bind Fc and antibodies, and these proteins can find use in the present invention for purification of Fc variants. For example, the bacterial proteins A and G bind to the Fc region. Likewise, the bacterial protein L binds to the Fab region of some antibodies, as of course does the antibody's target antigen. Purification can often be enabled by a particular fusion partner. For example, Fc variant proteins may be purified using glutathione resin if a GST fusion is employed, Ni\n+2 \naffinity chromatography if a His-tag is employed, or immobilized anti-flag antibody if a flag-tag is used. For general guidance in suitable purification techniques, see Protein Purification: Principles and Practice, 3\nrd \nEd., Scopes, Springer-Verlag, NY, 1994. The degree of purification necessary will vary depending on the screen or use of the Fc variants. In some instances no purification is necessary. For example in one embodiment, if the Fc variants are secreted, screening may take place directly from the media. As is well known in the art, some methods of selection do not involve purification of proteins. Thus, for example, if a library of Fc variants is made into a phage display library, protein purification may not be performed.\n\n\nFc variants may be screened using a variety of methods, including but not limited to those that use in vitro assays, in vivo and cell-based assays, and selection technologies. Automation and high-throughput screening technologies may be utilized in the screening procedures. Screening may employ the use of a fusion partner or label. The use of fusion partners has been discussed above. By “labeled” herein is meant that the Fc variants of the invention have one or more elements, isotopes, or chemical compounds attached to enable the detection in a screen. In general, labels fall into three classes: a) immune labels, which may be an epitope incorporated as a fusion partner that is recognized by an antibody, b) isotopic labels, which may be radioactive or heavy isotopes, and c) small molecule labels, which may include fluorescent and colorimetric dyes, or molecules such as biotin that enable other labeling methods. Labels may be incorporated into the compound at any position and may be incorporated in vitro or in vivo during protein expression.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the functional and/or biophysical properties of Fc variants are screened in an in vitro assay. In vitro assays may allow a broad dynamic range for screening properties of interest. Properties of Fc variants that may be screened include but are not limited to stability, solubility, and affinity for Fc ligands, for example FcγRs. Multiple properties may be screened simultaneously or individually. Proteins may be purified or unpurified, depending on the requirements of the assay. In one embodiment, the screen is a qualitative or quantitative binding assay for binding of Fc variants to a protein or nonprotein molecule that is known or thought to bind the Fc variant. In a preferred embodiment, the screen is a binding assay for measuring binding to the antibody's or Fc fusions' target antigen. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the screen is an assay for binding of Fc variants to an Fc ligand, including but are not limited to the family of FcγRs, the neonatal receptor FcRn, the complement protein C1q, and the bacterial proteins A and G. Said Fc ligands may be from any organism, with humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys preferred. Binding assays can be carried out using a variety of methods known in the art, including but not limited to FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) and BRET (Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer)-based assays, AlphaScreen™ (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay), Scintillation Proximity Assay, ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay), SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance, also known as BIACORE®), isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, gel electrophoresis, and chromatography including gel filtration. These and other methods may take advantage of some fusion partner or label of the Fc variant. Assays may employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic, fluorescent, luminescent, or isotopic labels.\n\n\nThe biophysical properties of Fc variant proteins, for example stability and solubility, may be screened using a variety of methods known in the art. Protein stability may be determined by measuring the thermodynamic equilibrium between folded and unfolded states. For example, Fc variant proteins of the present invention may be unfolded using chemical denaturant, heat, or pH, and this transition may be monitored using methods including but not limited to circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, absorbance spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry, and proteolysis. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the kinetic parameters of the folding and unfolding transitions may also be monitored using these and other techniques. The solubility and overall structural integrity of an Fc variant protein may be quantitatively or qualitatively determined using a wide range of methods that are known in the art. Methods which may find use in the present invention for characterizing the biophysical properties of Fc variant proteins include gel electrophoresis, chromatography such as size exclusion chromatography and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, analytical ultra-centrifugation, dynamic light scattering, proteolysis, and cross-linking, turbidity measurement, filter retardation assays, immunological assays, fluorescent dye binding assays, protein-staining assays, microscopy, and detection of aggregates via ELISA or other binding assay. Structural analysis employing X-ray crystallographic techniques and NMR spectroscopy may also find use. In one embodiment, stability and/or solubility may be measured by determining the amount of protein solution after some defined period of time. In this assay, the protein may or may not be exposed to some extreme condition, for example elevated temperature, low pH, or the presence of denaturant. Because function typically requires a stable, soluble, and/or well-folded/structured protein, the aforementioned functional and binding assays also provide ways to perform such a measurement. For example, a solution comprising an Fc variant could be assayed for its ability to bind target antigen, then exposed to elevated temperature for one or more defined periods of time, then assayed for antigen binding again. Because unfolded and aggregated protein is not expected to be capable of binding antigen, the amount of activity remaining provides a measure of the Fc variant's stability and solubility.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the library is screened using one or more cell-based or in vivo assays. For such assays, Fc variant proteins, purified or unpurified, are typically added exogenously such that cells are exposed to individual variants or pools of variants belonging to a library. These assays are typically, but not always, based on the function of an antibody or Fc fusion that comprises the Fc variant; that is, the ability of the antibody or Fc fusion to bind a target antigen and mediate some biochemical event, for example effector function, ligand/receptor binding inhibition, apoptosis, and the like. Such assays often involve monitoring the response of cells to antibody or Fc fusion, for example cell survival, cell death, change in cellular morphology, or transcriptional activation such as cellular expression of a natural gene or reporter gene. For example, such assays may measure the ability of Fc variants to elicit ADCC, ADCP, or CDC. For some assays additional cells or components, that is in addition to the target cells, may need to be added, for example serum complement, or effector cells such as peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs), NK cells, macrophages, and the like. Such additional cells may be from any organism, preferably humans, mice, rat, rabbit, and monkey. Antibodies and Fc fusions may cause apoptosis of certain cell lines expressing the antibody's target antigen, or they may mediate attack on target cells by immune cells which have been added to the assay. Methods for monitoring cell death or viability are known in the art, and include the use of dyes, immunochemical, cytochemical, and radioactive reagents. For example, caspase staining assays may enable apoptosis to be measured, and uptake or release of radioactive substrates or fluorescent dyes such as alamar blue may enable cell growth or activation to be monitored. In a preferred embodiment, the DELFIA® EuTDA-based cytotoxicity assay (Perkin Elmer, Mass.) is used. Alternatively, dead or damaged target cells may be monitoried by measuring the release of one or more natural intracellular proteins, for example lactate dehydrogenase. Transcriptional activation may also serve as a method for assaying function in cell-based assays. In this case, response may be monitored by assaying for natural genes or proteins which may be upregulated, for example the release of certain interleukins may be measured, or alternatively readout may be via a reporter construct. Cell-based assays may also involve the measure of morphological changes of cells as a response to the presence of an Fc variant. Cell types for such assays may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic, and a variety of cell lines that are known in the art may be employed.\n\n\nAlternatively, cell-based screens are performed using cells that have been transformed or transfected with nucleic acids encoding the Fc variants. That is, Fc variant proteins are not added exogenously to the cells. For example, in one embodiment, the cell-based screen utilizes cell surface display. A fusion partner can be employed that enables display of Fc variants on the surface of cells (Witrrup, 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol, \n12:395-399). Cell surface display methods that may find use in the present invention include but are not limited to display on bacteria (Georgiou et al., 1997\n, Nat Biotechnol \n15:29-34; Georgiou et al., 1993\n, Trends Biotechnol \n11:6-10; Lee et al., 2000\n, Nat Biotechnol \n18:645-648; Jun et al., 1998\n, Nat Biotechnol \n16:576-80), yeast (Boder & Wittrup, 2000\n, Methods Enzymol \n328:430-44; Boder & Wittrup, 1997\n, Nat Biotechnol \n15:553-557), and mammalian cells (Whitehorn et al., 1995\n, Bio/technology \n13:1215-1219). In an alternate embodiment, Fc variant proteins are not displayed on the surface of cells, but rather are screened intracellularly or in some other cellular compartment. For example, periplasmic expression and cytometric screening (Chen et al., 2001\n, Nat Biotechnol \n19: 537-542), the protein fragment complementation assay (Johnsson & Varshavsky, 1994\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n91:10340-10344.; Pelletier et al., 1998\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n95:12141-12146), and the yeast two hybrid screen (Fields & Song, 1989\n, Nature \n340:245-246) may find use in the present invention. Alternatively, if a polypeptide that comprises the Fc variants, for example an antibody or Fc fusion, imparts some selectable growth advantage to a cell, this property may be used to screen or select for Fc variants.\n\n\nAs is known in the art, a subset of screening methods are those that select for favorable members of a library. Said methods are herein referred to as “selection methods”, and these methods find use in the present invention for screening Fc variant libraries. When libraries are screened using a selection method, only those members of a library that are favorable, that is which meet some selection criteria, are propagated, isolated, and/or observed. As will be appreciated, because only the most fit variants are observed, such methods enable the screening of libraries that are larger than those screenable by methods that assay the fitness of library members individually. Selection is enabled by any method, technique, or fusion partner that links, covalently or noncovalently, the phenotype of an Fc variant with its genotype, that is the function of an Fc variant with the nucleic acid that encodes it. For example the use of phage display as a selection method is enabled by the fusion of library members to the gene III protein. In this way, selection or isolation of variant proteins that meet some criteria, for example binding affinity for an FcγR, also selects for or isolates the nucleic acid that encodes it. Once isolated, the gene or genes encoding Fc variants may then be amplified. This process of isolation and amplification, referred to as panning, may be repeated, allowing favorable Fc variants in the library to be enriched. Nucleic acid sequencing of the attached nucleic acid ultimately allows for gene identification.\n\n\nA variety of selection methods are known in the art that may find use in the present invention for screening Fc variant libraries. These include but are not limited to phage display (Phage display of peptides and proteins: a laboratory manual, Kay et al., 1996, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1996; Lowman et al., 1991\n, Biochemistry \n30:10832-10838; Smith, 1985\n, Science \n228:1315-1317) and its derivatives such as selective phage infection (Malmborg et al., 1997\n, J Mol Biol \n273:544-551), selectively infective phage (Krebber et al., 1997\n, J Mol Biol \n268:619-630), and delayed infectivity panning (Benhar et al., 2000\n, J Mol Biol \n301:893-904), cell surface display (Witrrup, 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol, \n12:395-399) such as display on bacteria (Georgiou et al., 1997\n, Nat Biotechnol \n15:29-34; Georgiou et al., 1993\n, Trends Biotechnol \n11:6-10; Lee et al., 2000\n, Nat Biotechnol \n18:645-648; Jun et al., 1998\n, Nat Biotechnol \n16:576-80), yeast (Boder & Wittrup, 2000\n, Methods Enzymol \n328:430-44; Boder & Wittrup, 1997\n, Nat Biotechnol \n15:553-557), and mammalian cells (Whitehorn et al., 1995\n, Bio/technology \n13:1215-1219), as well as in vitro display technologies (Amstutz et al., 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n12:400-405) such as polysome display (Mattheakis et al., 1994\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n91:9022-9026), ribosome display (Hanes et al., 1997\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n94:4937-4942), mRNA display (Roberts & Szostak, 1997\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n94:12297-12302; Nemoto et al., 1997\n, FEBS Lett \n414:405-408), and ribosome-inactivation display system (Zhou et al., 2002\n, J Am Chem Soc \n124, 538-543)\n\n\nOther selection methods that may find use in the present invention include methods that do not rely on display, such as in vivo methods including but not limited to periplasmic expression and cytometric screening (Chen et al., 2001\n, Nat Biotechnol \n19:537-542), the protein fragment complementation assay (Johnsson & Varshavsky, 1994\n, Proc Nat Acad Sci USA \n91:10340-10344; Pelletier et al., 1998\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n95:12141-12146), and the yeast two hybrid screen (Fields & Song, 1989\n, Nature \n340:245-246) used in selection mode (Visintin et al., 1999\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n96:11723-11728). In an alternate embodiment, selection is enabled by a fusion partner that binds to a specific sequence on the expression vector, thus linking covalently or noncovalently the fusion partner and associated Fc variant library member with the nucleic acid that encodes them. For example, U.S. Ser. No. 09/642,574; U.S. Ser. No. 10/080,376; U.S. Ser. No. 09/792,630; U.S. Ser. No. 10/023,208; U.S. Ser. No. 09/792,626; U.S. Ser. No. 10/082,671; U.S. Ser. No. 09/953,351; U.S. Ser. No. 10/097,100; U.S. Ser. No. 60/366,658; PCT WO 00/22906; PCT WO 01/49058; PCT WO 02/04852; PCT WO 02/04853; PCT WO 02/08023; PCT WO 01/28702; and PCT WO 02/07466 describe such a fusion partner and technique that may find use in the present invention. In an alternative embodiment, in vivo selection can occur if expression of a polypeptide that comprises the Fc variant, such as an antibody or Fc fusion, imparts some growth, reproduction, or survival advantage to the cell.\n\n\nA subset of selection methods referred to as “directed evolution” methods are those that include the mating or breading of favorable sequences during selection, sometimes with the incorporation of new mutations. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, directed evolution methods can facilitate identification of the most favorable sequences in a library, and can increase the diversity of sequences that are screened. A variety of directed evolution methods are known in the art that may find use in the present invention for screening Fc variant libraries, including but not limited to DNA shuffling (PCT WO 00/42561 A3; PCT WO 01/70947 A3), exon shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 6,365,377; Kolkman & Stemmer, 2001\n, Nat Biotechnol \n19:423-428), family shuffling (Crameri et al., 1998\n, Nature \n391:288-291; U.S. Pat. No. 6,376,246), RACHITT™ (Coco et al., 2001\n, Nat Biotechnol \n19:354-359; PCT WO 02/06469), STEP and random priming of in vitro recombination (Zhao et al., 1998\n, Nat Biotechnol \n16:258-261; Shao et al., 1998\n, Nucleic Acids Res \n26:681-683), exonuclease mediated gene assembly (U.S. Pat. No. 6,352,842; U.S. Pat. No. 6,361,974), Gene Site Saturation Mutagenesis™ (U.S. Pat. No. 6,358,709), Gene Reassembly™ (U.S. Pat. No. 6,358,709), SCRATCHY (Lutz et al., 2001\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n98:11248-11253), DNA fragmentation methods (Kikuchi et al., Gene 236:159-167), single-stranded DNA shuffling (Kikuchi et al., 2000\n, Gene \n243:133-137), and AMEsystem™ directed evolution protein engineering technology (Applied Molecular Evolution) (US U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,514; U.S. Pat. No. 5,817,483; U.S. Pat. No. 5,814,476; U.S. Pat. No. 5,763,192; U.S. Pat. No. 5,723,323).\n\n\nThe biological properties of the antibodies and Fc fusions that comprise the Fc variants of the present invention may be characterized in cell, tissue, and whole organism experiments. As is know in the art, drugs are often tested in animals, including but not limited to mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, cats, pigs, and monkeys, in order to measure a drug's efficacy for treatment against a disease or disease model, or to measure a drug's pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and other properties. Said animals may be referred to as disease models. Therapeutics are often tested in mice, including but not limited to nude mice, SCID mice, xenograft mice, and transgenic mice (including knockins and knockouts). For example, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention that is intended as an anti-cancer therapeutic may be tested in a mouse cancer model, for example a xenograft mouse. In this method, a tumor or tumor cell line is grafted onto or injected into a mouse, and subsequently the mouse is treated with the therapeutic to determine the ability of the antibody or Fc fusion to reduce or inhibit cancer growth. Such experimentation may provide meaningful data for determination of the potential of said antibody or Fc fusion to be used as a therapeutic. Any organism, preferably mammals, may be used for testing. For example because of their genetic similarity to humans, monkeys can be suitable therapeutic models, and thus may be used to test the efficacy, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, or other property of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention. Tests of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention in humans are ultimately required for approval as drugs, and thus of course these experiments are contemplated. Thus the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may be tested in humans to determine their therapeutic efficacy, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and/or other clinical properties.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExamples are provided below to illustrate the present invention. These examples are not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular application or theory of operation.\n\n\nFor all positions discussed in the present invention, numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat (Kabat et al., 1991\n, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5th Ed., United States Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Those skilled in the art of antibodies will appreciate that this convention consists of nonsequential numbering in specific regions of an immunoglobulin sequence, enabling a normalized reference to conserved positions in immunoglobulin families. Accordingly, the positions of any given immunoglobulin as defined by the EU index will not necessarily correspond to its sequential sequence. \nFIG. 3\n shows the sequential and EU index numbering schemes for the antibody alemtuzumab in order to illustrate this principal more clearly. It should also be noted that polymorphisms have been observed at a number of Fc positions, including but not limited to \nKabat\n 270, 272, 312, 315, 356, and 358, and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the scientific literature may exist.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nComputational Screening and Design of Fc Libraries\n\n\nComputational screening calculations were carried out to design optimized Fc variants. Fc variants were computationally screened, constructed, and experimentally investigated over several computation/experimention cycles. For each successive cycle, experimental data provided feedback into the next set of computational screening calculations and library design. All computational screening calculations and library design are presented in Example 1. For each set of calculations, a table is provided that presents the results and provides relevant information and parameters.\n\n\nSeveral different structures of Fc bound to the extracellular domain of FcγRs served as template structures for the computational screening calculations. Publicly available Fc/FcγR complex structures included pdb accession code 1E4K (Sondermann et al., 2000\n, Nature \n406:267-273.), and pdb accession codes 1IIS and 1IIX (Radaev et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:16469-16477). The extracellular regions of FcγRIIIb and FcγRIIIa are 96% identical, and therefore the use of the Fc/FcγRIIIb structure is essentially equivalent to use of FcγRIIa. Nonetheless, for some calculations, a more precise Fc/FcγRIIIa template structure was constructed by modeling a D129G mutation in the 1IIS and 1E4K structures (referred to as D129G 1IIS and D129G 1E4K template structures). In addition, the structures for human Fc bound to the extracellular domains of human FcγRIIb, human F158 FcγRIIIa, and mouse FcγRIII were modeled using standard methods, the available FcγR sequence information, the aforementioned Fc/FcγR structures, as well as structural information for unbound complexes (pdb accession code 1H9V) (Sondermann et al., 2001\n, J Mol Biol \n309:737-749) (\npdb accession code\n 1 FCG) (Maxwell et al., 1999\n, Nat Struct Biol \n6:437-442), FcγRIIb (pdb accession code 2FCB) (Sondermann et al., 1999\n, Embo J \n18:1095-1103), and FcγRIIIb (pdb accession code 1E4J) (Sondermann et al., 2000\n, Nature \n406:267-273.).\n\n\nVariable positions and amino acids to be considered at those positions were chosen by visual inspection of the aforementioned Fc/FcγR and FcγR structures, and using solvent accessibility information and sequence information. Sequence information of Fcs and FcγRs was particularly useful for determining variable positions at which substitutions may provide distinguishing affinities between activating and inhibitory receptors. Virtually all Cγ2 positions were screened computationally. The Fc structure is a homodimer of two heavy chains (labeled chains A and B in the 1 IIS, 1IIX, and 1E4K structures) that each include the hinge and Cγ2-Cγ3 domains (shown in \nFIG. 2\n). Because the FcγR (labeled chain C in the 1IIS, 1IIX, and 1E4K structures) binds asymmetrically to the Fc homodimer, each chain was often considered separately in design calculations. For some calculations, Fc and/or FcγR residues proximal to variable position residues were floated, that is the amino acid conformation but not the amino acid identity was allowed to vary in a protein design calculation to allow for conformational adjustments. These are indicated below the table for each set of calculations when relevant. Considered amino acids typically belonged to either the Core, Core XM, Surface, Boundary, Boundary XM, or All 20 classifications, unless noted otherwise. These classifications are defined as follows: Core=alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine; Core XM=alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; Surface=alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine and histidine; Boundary=alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine, histidine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine; Boundary XM=Boundary=alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine, histidine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; All 20=all 20 naturally occurring amino acids.\n\n\nThe majority of calculations followed one of two general types of computational screening methods. In one method, the conformations of amino acids at variable positions were represented as a set of backbone-independent side chain rotamers derived from the rotamer library of Dunbrack & Cohen (Dunbrack et al., 1997\n, Protein Sci \n6:1661-1681). The energies of all possible combinations of the considered amino acids at the chosen variable positions were calculated using a force field containing terms describing van der Waals, solvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions, and the optimal (ground state) sequence was determined using a Dead End Elimination (DEE) algorithm. As will be appreciated by those in the art, the predicted lowest energy sequence is not necessarily the true lowest energy sequence because of errors primarily in the scoring function, coupled with the fact that subtle conformational differences in proteins can result in dramatic differences in stability. However, the predicted ground state sequence is likely to be close to the true ground state, and thus additional favorable diversity can be explored by evaluating the energy of sequences that are close in sequence space and energy around the predicted ground state. To accomplish this, as well as to generate a diversity of sequences for a library, a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm was used to evaluate the energies of 1000 similar sequences around the predicted ground state. The number of sequences out of the 1000 sequence set that contain that amino acid at that variable position is referred to as the occupancy for that substitution, and this value may reflect how favorable that substitution is. This computational screening method is substantially similar to Protein Design Automation® (PDA®) technology, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,188,965; U.S. Pat. No. 6,269,312; U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. No. 09/782,004; U.S. Ser. No. 09/927,790; U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588, and for ease of description, is referred to as PDA® technology throughout the examples. Tables that present the results of these calculations provide for each variable position on the designated chain (column 1) the amino acids considered at each variable position (column 2), the WT Fc amino acid identity at each variable position (column 3), the amino acid identity at each variable position in the DEE ground state sequence (column 4), and the set of amino acids and corresponding occupancy that are observed in the Monte Carlo output (column 5). For example in the first row of Table 1 below, when position 328 was varied using boundary amino acids as the set of variable residues for that position, L occurred 330 times in the top 1000 sequence, M occurred 302 times, etc.\n\n\nOther calculations utilized a genetic algorithm (GA) to screen for low energy sequences, with energies being calculated during each round of “evolution” for those sequences being sampled. The conformations of amino acids at variable and floated positions were represented as a set of side chain rotamers derived from a backbone-independent rotamer library using a flexible rotamer model (Mendes et al., 1999\n, Proteins \n37:530-543). Energies were calculated using a force field containing terms describing van der Waals, salvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions. This calculation generated a list of 300 sequences which are predicted to be low in energy. To facilitate analysis of the results and library generation, the 300 output sequences were clustered computationally into 10 groups of similar sequences using a nearest neighbor single linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm to assign sequences to related groups based on similarity scores (Diamond, 1995\n, Acta Cryst \nD51:127-135). That is, all sequences within a group are most similar to all other sequences within the same group and less similar to sequences in other groups. The lowest energy sequence from each of these ten clusters are used as a representative of each group, and are presented as results. This computational screening method is substantially similar to Sequence Prediction Algorithm™ (SPA™) technology, as described in (Raha et al., 2000\n, Protein Sci \n9:1106-1119); U.S. Ser. No. 09/877,695; and U.S. Ser. No. 10/071,859, and for ease of description, is referred to as SPA™ technology throughout the examples. Tables that present the results of these calculations provide for each variable position on the designated chain (column 1) the amino acids considered at each variable position (column 2), the WT Fc amino acid identity at each variable position (column 3), and the amino acid identity at the variable positions for the lowest energy sequence from each cluster group (columns 4-13).\n\n\nComputational screening was applied to design energetically favorable interactions at the Fc/FcγR interface at groups of variable positions that mediate or potentially mediate binding with FcγR. Because the binding interface involves a large number of Fc residues on the two different chains, and because FcγRs bind asymmetrically to Fc, residues were grouped in different sets of interacting variable positions, and designed in separate sets of calculations. In many cases these sets were chosen as groups of residues that were deemed to be coupled, that is the energy of one or more residues is dependent on the identity of one or more other residues. Various template structures were used, and in many cases calculations explored substitutions on both chains. For many of the variable position sets, calculations were carried out using both the PDA® and SPA™ technology computational screening methods described. The results of these calculations and relevant are presented in Tables 1-30 below. Relevant parameters and information are presented below each table, including the computational screening method used, the template structure used, whether or not that structure had carbohydrate atoms, and any residues that may have been floated. For example, Table 2 presents results from a PDA® calculation in which \nresidues\n 120, 132, and 134 on chain C (the FcγRIIIb receptor) were floated.\n\n\nIncluded within the compositions of the invention are antibodies that have any of the listed amino acid residues in the listed positions, either alone or in any combination (note preferred combinations are listed in the claims, the summary and the figures). One preferred combination is the listed amino acid residues in the listed positions in a ground state (sometimes referred to herein as the “global solution”, as distinguished from the wild-type). In addition, combinations between SPA™ proteins, both within tables and between tables, are also included. It should be noted that residues not listed in a given table are implied to have not been varied, and thus remain wild-type. For example, in the SPA™ calculation results presented in Table 4, column 4 (representing cluster 1) indicates a protein with the six listed amino acids at the six listed positions (\ne.g. column\n 4 is a single protein with a wild-type sequence except for 239E, 265G, 267S, 269Y, 270T and 299S). Thus, each of these individual proteins are included within the invention. Alternatively, residue positions and particular amino acids at those residue positions may be combined between columns within a table, or between tables. Furthermore, it should be noted that although each table indicates the presence or absence of carbohydrate, the presence or absence of said atoms in the computational screening calculation is not meant to imply that Fc variants designed by such calculations should be applicable to only aglycosylated or glycosylated Fc. Thus although the calculations in Table 1 were run without carbohydrate atoms present in the template structure, the resulting predicted substitutions may be favorable in a glycosylated or aglycosylated antibody or Fc fusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConsidered\n\n\n \n\n\nGround\n\n\nSequences Around\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition\n\n\nAmino Acids\n\n\nWT\n\n\nState\n\n\nGround State\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n328 A\n\n\nBoundary\n\n\nL\n\n\nL\n\n\nL: 330 M: 302 E: 111 K: 62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nA: 45 Q: 39 D: 36 S: 30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nT: 28 N: 10 R: 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n332 A\n\n\nSurface\n\n\nI\n\n\nR\n\n\nR: 247 K: 209 Q: 130 H: 95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nE: 92 T: 59 D: 51 N: 51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nS: 42 A: 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n328 B\n\n\nBoundary\n\n\nL\n\n\nL\n\n\nL: 321 M: 237 T: 166 K: 73\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nR: 72 S: 55 Q: 20 D: 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nE: 13 A: 12 V: 10 N: 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n332 B\n\n\nSurface\n\n\nI\n\n\nE\n\n\nE: 269 Q: 180 R: 145 K: 111\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nD: 97 T: 78 N: 65 S: 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nA: 14 H: 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDA ® technology, 1IIS template structure;

Design calculations were aimed at designing favorable substitutions in the context of the aglycosylated Fc template structure at residue 297, residues proximal to it, residues at the Fc/FcγR interface, and residues at the Fc/carbohydrate interface. Variable positions were grouped in different sets of interacting variable positions and designed in separate sets of calculations, and various template structures were used.

The N297 carbohydrate covers up the exposed hydrophobic patch that would normally be the interface for a protein-protein interaction with another Ig domain, maintaining the stability and structural integrity of Fc and keeping the Cγ2 domains from aggregating across the central axis. Key residues for design are F241, F243, V262, and V264, which reside behind the carbohydrate on Cγ2, in addition to residues such as L328, I332, and I336, which are exposed nonpolar residues facing inward towards the opposed Cγ2 domain, that were considered in previously presented calculations. The importance of these Cγ2 residues is supported by noting that the corresponding residues in the Cγ3 domain by sequence alignment either mediate the nonpolar interaction between the two Cγ3 domains or are buried in the Cγ3 core.

The lowest energy rotamer conformation for all 20 amino acids was determined, and this energy was defined as the energy of substitution for that amino acid at that variable position. These calculations thus provided an energy of substitution for each of the 20 amino acids at each variable position. The calculations used various template structures including different Fc/FcγRIIIb complexes (1IIS, 1IIX, 1E4K), a modeled Fc/FcγRIIb complex, and uncomplexed Fc (1DN2), and thus were useful for a variety of design goals aimed at both glycosylated and aglycosylated Fc, including optimization of Fc/FcγR affinity, C1q affinity, Fc stability, Fc solubility, carbohydrate conformation, and hinge conformation. Furthermore, because these calculations provide energies for both favorable and unfavorable substitutions, they guide substitutions that may enable differential binding to activating versus inhibitory FcγRs. Various template structures were used, and calculations explored substitutions on both chains. The results of these calculations and relevant parameters and information are presented in Tables 54-60 below. \nColumn\n 1 lists the variable positions on chain A and B of the template structure. \nColumn\n 2 lists the wild-type amino acid identity at each variable position. The remaining 20 columns provide the energy for each of the natural 20 amino acids (shown in the top row). All substitutions were normalized with respect to the lowest energy substitution, which was set to 0 energy. For example in Table 54, for L235 on chain A, serine is the lowest energy substitution, and L235A is 0.9 kcal/mol less stable than L235S. Extremely high energies were set to 20 kcal/mol for energies between 20-50 kcal/mol, and 50 kcal/mold for energies greater than 50 kcal/mol. Favorable substitutions may be considered to be the lowest energy substitution for each position, and substitutions that have small energy differences from the lowest energy substitution, for example substitutions within 1-2, 1-3, 1-5, or 1-10 kcal/mol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

results of the design calculations presented above in Tables 1-60 were used to construct a series of Fc variant libraries for experimental production and screening. Experimental libraries were designed in successive rounds of computational and experimental screening. Design of subsequent Fc libraries benefitted from feedback from prior libraries, and thus typically comprised combinations of Fc variants that showed favorable properties in the previous screen. The entire set of Fc variants that were constructed and experimentally tested is shown in Table 61. In this table, \nrow\n 1 lists the variable positions, and the rows that follow indicate the amino acids at those variable positions for WT and the Fc variants. For example, \nvariant\n 18 has the following four mutations: F241E, F243Y, V262T, and V264R. The variable position residues that compose this set of Fc variants are illustrated structurally in \nFIG. 4\n, and are presented in the context of the human IgG1 Fc sequence in \nFIG.

and Screening of Fc Libraries\n\n\nThe majority of experimentation on the Fc variants was carried out in the context of the anti-cancer antibody alemtuzumab (Campath®, a registered trademark of IIex Pharmaceuticals LP). Alemtuzumab binds a short linear epitope within its target antigen CD52 (Hale et al., 1990\n, Tissue Antigens \n35:118-127; Hale, 1995\n, Immunotechnology \n1:175-187). Alemtuzumab has been chosen as the primary engineering template because its efficacy is due in part to its ability to recruit effector cells (Dyer et al., 1989\n, Blood \n73:1431-1439; Friend et al., 1991\n, Transplant Proc \n23:2253-2254; Hale et al., 1998\n, Blood \n92:4581-4590; Glennie et al., 2000\n, Immunol Today \n21:403-410), and because production and use of its antigen in binding assays are relatively straightforward. In order to evaluate the optimized Fc variants of the present invention in the context of other antibodies, select Fc variants were evaluated in the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (Rituxan®, a registered trademark of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation), the anti-Her2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin®, a registered trademark of Genentech), and the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab (Erbitux®, a registered trademark of Imclone). The use of alemtuzumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab for screening purposes is not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular antibody.\n\n\nThe IgG1 full length light (V\nL\n-C\nL\n) and heavy (V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3) chain antibody genes for alemtuzumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab were constructed with convenient end restriction sites to facilitate subcloning. The genes were ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1Zeo (Invitrogen). The V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3 clone in pcDNA3.1zeo was used as a template for mutagenesis of the Fc region. Mutations were introduced into this clone using PCR-based mutagenesis techniques. Fc variants were sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the sequence. Plasmids containing heavy chain gene (V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3) (wild-type or variants) were co-transfected with plasmid containing light chain gene (V\nL\n-C\nL\n) into 293T cells. Media were harvested 5 days after transfection. Expression of immunoglobulin was monitored by screening the culture supernatant of transfectomas by western using peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, catalog #109-035-088). \nFIG. 6\n shows expression of wild-type alemtuzumab and \nvariants\n 1 through 10 in 293T cells. Antibodies were purified from the supernatant using protein A affinity chromatography (Pierce, Catalog #20334. \nFIG. 7\n shows results of the protein purification for WT alemtuzumab. Antibody Fc variants showed similar expression and purification results to WT. Some Fc variants were deglycosylated in order to determine their solution and functional properties in the absence of carbohydrate. To obtain deglycosylated antibodies, purified alemtuzumab antibodies were incubated with peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGase F) at 37° C. for 24 h. \nFIG. 8\n presents an SDS PAGE gel confirming deglycosylation for several Fc variants and WT alemtuzumab.\n\n\nIn order to confirm the functional fidelity of alemtuzumab produced under these conditions, the antigenic CD52 peptide, fused to GST, was expressed in \nE. coli \nBL21 (DE3) under IPTG induction. Both un-induced and induced samples were run on a SDS PAGE gel, and transferred to PVDF membrane. For western analysis, either alemtuzumab from Sotec (final concentration 2.5 ng/ul) or media of transfected 293T cells (final alemtuzumab concentration about 0.1-0.2 ng/ul) were used as primary antibody, and peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG was used as secondary antibody. \nFIG. 9\n presents these results. The ability to bind target antigen confirms the structural and functional fidelity of the expressed alemtuzumab. Fc variants that have the same variable region as WT alemtuzumab are anticipated to maintain a comparable binding affinity for antigen.\n\n\nIn order to screen for Fc/FcγR binding, the extracellular regions of human V158 FcγRIIIa, human F158 FcγRIIIa, human FcγRIIb, human FcγRIIa, and mouse FcγRIII, were expressed and purified. \nFIG. 10\n presents an SDS PAGE gel that shows the results of expression and purification of human V158 FcγRIIIa. The extracellular region of this receptor was obtained by PCR from a clone obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC:22630). The receptor was fused with glutathione S-Transferase (GST) to enable screening. Tagged FcγRIIIa was transfected in 293T cells, and media containing secreted FcγRIIIa were harvested 3 days later and purified. For western analysis, membrane was probed with anti-GST antibody.\n\n\nBinding affinity to FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIb was measured for all designed Fc variants using an AlphaScreen™ assay (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay (ALPHA), Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, Mass.), a bead-based non-radioactive luminescent proximity assay. Laser excitation of a donor bead excites oxygen, which if sufficiently close to the acceptor bead generates a cascade of chemiluminescent events, ultimately leading to fluorescence emission at 520-620 nm. The AlphaScreen™ assay was applied as a competition assay for screening Fc variants. WT alemtuzumab antibody was biotinylated by standard methods for attachment to streptavidin donor beads, and GST-tagged FcγR was bound to glutathione chelate acceptor beads. In the absence of competing Fc variants, WT antibody and FcγR interact and produce a signal at 520-620 nm. Addition of untagged Fc variant competes with the WT Fc/FcγR interaction, reducing fluorescence quantitatively to enable determination of relative binding affinities. All Fc variants were screened for V158 FcγRIIIa binding using the AlphaScreen™ assay. Fc variants were screened in the context of either alemtuzumab or trastuzumab, and select Fc variants were also screened in the context of rituximab and cetuximab. Select Fc variants were subsequently screened for binding to FcγRIIb, as well as other FcγRs and Fc ligands.\n\n\n \nFIG. 11\n shows AlphaScreen™ data for binding to human V158 FcγRIIIa by select Fc variants. The binding data were normalized to the maximum and minimum luminescence signal for each particular curve, provided by the baselines at low and high antibody concentrations respectively. The data were fit to a one site competition model using nonlinear regression, and these fits are represented by the curves in the figure. These fits provide the \ninhibitory concentration\n 50% (IC50) (i.e. the concentration required for 50% inhibition) for each antibody, illustrated by the dotted lines in \nFIG. 11\n, thus enabling the relative binding affinities of Fc variants to be quantitatively determined. Here, WT alemtuzumab has an IC50 of (4.63×10\n−9\n)×(2)=9.2 nM, whereas S239D has an IC50 of (3.98×10\n−10\n)×(2)=0.8 nM. Thus S239D alemtuzumab binds 9.2 nM/0.8 nM=11.64-fold more tightly than WT alemtuzumab to human V158 FcγRIIIa. Similar calculations were performed for the binding of all Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa. Select Fc variants were also screened for binding to human FcγRIIb, and examples of these AlphaScreen™ binding data are shown in \nFIG. 12\n. Table 62 presents the fold-enhancement or fold-reduction relative to the parent antibody for binding of Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa (column 3) and human FcγRIIb (column 4), as determined by the AlphaScreen™ assay. For these data, a fold above 1 indicates an enhancement in binding affinity, and a fold below 1 indicates a reduction in binding affinity relative to WT Fc. Data for 1-206 and 217-218 were obtained in the context of alemtuzumab, except for those indicated with an asterix (*), which were tested in the context of trastuzumab. All data for 207-216 and 219-303 were obtained in the context of trastuzumab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFcγRIIIa\n\n\n

Binding to FcγRs\n\n\nA number of promising Fc variants with optimized properties were obtained from the FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIb screen. Table 62 provides Fc variants that bind more tightly to FcγRIIIa, and thus are candidates for improving the effector function of antibodies and Fc fusions. These include a number of variants that comprise substitutions at 239, 264, 272, 274, 330, and 332. \nFIGS. 13\n \na \nand \n13\n \nb \nshow AlphaScreen™ binding data for some of these Fc variants. The majority of these Fc variants provide substantially greater FcγRIIIa binding enhancements over S298A/E333A/K334A.\n\n\nSelect Fc variants were screened in the context of multiple antibodies in order to investigate the breadth of their applicability. AlphaScreen™ data for binding of select Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa in the context of trastuzumab, rituximab, and cetuximab are shown in \nFIGS. 14\n \na\n, \n14\n \nb\n, \n15\n \na\n, and \n15\n \nb\n. Together with the data for alemtuzumab in \nFIG. 13\n, the results indicate consistent binding enhancements regardless of the antibody context, and thus that the Fc variants of the present invention are broadly applicable to antibodies and Fc fusions.\n\n\nFc variants have been obtained that show differentially enhanced binding to FcγRIIIa over FcγRIIb. As discussed, optimal effector function may result from Fc variants wherein affinity for activating FcγRs is greater than affinity for the inhibitory FcγRIIb. AlphaScreen™ data directly comparing binding to FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIb for two Fc variants with this specificity profile are shown in \nFIGS. 16\n \na \nand \n16\n \nb\n. This concept can be defined quantitatively as the fold-enhancement or -reduction of the activating FγR (Table 62, column 3) divided by the fold-enhancement or -reduction of the inhibitory FcγR (Table 62, column 4), herein referred to as the FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold ratio. This value is provided in \nColumn\n 5 in Table 62. Table 62 shows that Fc variants provide this specificity profile, with a FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold ratio as high as 86:1.\n\n\nSome of the most promising Fc variants of the present invention for enhancing effector function have both substantial increases in affinity for FcγRIIIa and favorable FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold ratios. These include, for example, S239D/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold=56, FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold=3), S239D/A330Y/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold=130), S239D/A330L/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold=139, FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold=18), and S239D/S298A/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold=295, FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold=48). \nFIG. 17\n shows AlphaScreen™ binding data for these and other Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa.\n\n\nBecause there are a number of FcγRs that contribute to effector function, it may be worthwhile to additionally screen Fc variants against other receptors. \nFIG. 18\n shows AlphaScreen™ data for binding of select Fc variants to human R131 FcγRIIa. As can be seen, those aforementioned variants with favorable binding enhancements and specificity profiles also show enhanced binding to this activating receptor. The use of FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIb, and FcγRIIc for screening is not meant to constrain experimental testing to these particular FcγRs; other FcγRs are contemplated for screening, including but not limited to the myriad isoforms and allotypes of FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII from humans, mice, rats, monkeys, and the like, as previously described.\n\n\nTaken together, the FcγR binding data provided in \nFIGS. 11-18\n and Table 62 indicate that a number of substitions at \n \npositions\n \n 234, 235, 239, 240, 243, 264, 266, 272, 274, 278, 325, 328, 330, and 332 are promising candidates for improving the effector function of antibodies and Fc fusions. Because combinations of some of these substitutions have typically resulted in additive or synergistic binding improvements, it is anticipated that as yet unexplored combinations of the Fc variants provided in Table 62 will also provide favorable results. Thus all combinations of the Fc variants in Table 62 are contemplated. Likewise, combinations of any of the Fc variants in Table 62 with other discovered or undiscovered Fc variants may also provide favorable properties, and these combinations are also contemplated. Furthermore, it is anticipated from these results that other substitutions at \n \npositions\n \n 234, 235, 239, 240, 243, 264, 266, 325, 328, 330, and 332 may also provide favorable binding enhancements and specificities, and thus substitutions at these positions other than those presented in Table 62 are contemplated.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nReduced Binding to FcγRs\n\n\nAs discussed, although there is a need for greater effector function, for some antibody therapeutics, reduced or eliminated effector function may be desired. Several Fc variants in Table 62 substantially reduce or ablate FcγR binding, and thus may find use in antibodies and Fc fusions wherein effector function is undesirable. AlphaScreen™ binding data for some examples of such variants are shown in \nFIGS. 19\n \na \nand \n19\n \nb\n. These Fc variants, as well as their use in combination, may find use for eliminating effector function when desired, for example in antibodies and Fc fusions whose mechanism of action involves blocking or antagonism but not killing of the cells bearing target antigen.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nAglycosylated Fc Variants\n\n\nAs discussed, one goal of the current experiments was to obtain optimized aglycosylated Fc variants. Several Fc variants provide significant progress towards this goal. Because it is the site of glycosylation, substitution at N297 results in an aglycosylated Fc. Whereas all other Fc variants that comprise a substitution at N297 completely ablate FcγR binding, N297D/I332E has significant binding affinity for FcγRIIIa, shown in Table 62 and illustrated in \nFIG. 20\n. The exact reason for this result is uncertain in the absence of a high-resolution structure for this variant, although the computational screening predictions suggest that it is potentially due to a combination of new favorable Fc/FcγR interactions and favorable electrostatic properties. Indeed other electrostatic substitutions are envisioned for further optimization of aglycosylated Fc. Table 62 shows that other aglycosylated Fc variants such as S239D/N297D/I332E and N297D/A330Y/I332E provide binding enhancements that bring affinity for FcγRIIIa within 0.28- and 0.43-fold respectively of glycosylated WT alemtuzumab. Combinations of these variants with other Fc variants that enhance FcγR binding are contemplated, with the goal of obtaining aglycosylated Fc variants that bind one or more FcγRs with affinity that is approximately the same as or even better than glycosylated parent Fc. An additional set of promising Fc variants provide stability and solubility enhancements in the absence of carbohydrate. Fc variants that comprise substitutions at positions 241, 243, 262, and 264, positions that do not mediate FγR binding but do determine the interface between the carbohydrate and Fc, ablate FγR binding, presumably because they perturb the conformation of the carbohydrate. In deglycosylated form, however, Fc variants F241E/F243R/V262E/V264R, F241E/F243Q/V262T/V264E, F241R/F243Q/V262T/V264R, and F241E/F243Y/V262T/V264R show stronger binding to FcγRIIIa than in glycosylated form, as shown by the AlphaScreen™ data in \nFIG. 21\n. This result indicates that these are key positions for optimization of the structure, stability, solubility, and function of aglycosylated Fc. Together these results suggests that protein engineering can be used to restore the favorable functional and solution properties of antibodies and Fc fusions in the absence of carbohydrate, and pave the way for aglycosylated antibodies and Fc fusions with favorable solution properties and full functionality that comprise substitutions at these and other Fc positions.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nAffinity of Fc Variants for Polymorphic Forms of FcγRIIIa\n\n\nAs discussed above, an important parameter of Fc-mediated effector function is the affinity of Fc for both V158 and F158 polymorphic forms of FcγRIIIa. AlphaScreen™ data comparing binding of select variants to the two receptor allotypes are shown in \nFIG. 22\n \na \n(V158 FcγRIIIa) and \nFIG. 22\n \nb \n(F158 FcγRIIIa). As can be seen, all variants improve binding to both FcγRIIIa allotypes. These data indicate that those Fc variants of the present invention with enhanced effector function will be broadly applicable to the entire patient population, and that enhancement to clinical efficacy will potentially be greatest for the low responsive patient population who need it most.\n\n\nThe FcγR binding affinities of these Fc variants were further investigated using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). SPR is a sensitive and extremely quantitative method that allows for the measurement of binding affinities of protein-protein interactions, and has been used to effectively measure Fc/FcγR binding (Radaev et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:16478-16483). SPR thus provides an excellent complementary binding assay to the AlphaScreen™ assay. His-tagged V158 FcγRIIIa was immobilized to an SPR chip, and WT and Fc variant alemtuzumab antibodies were flowed over the chip at a range of concentrations. Binding constants were obtained from fitting the data using standard curve-fitting methods. Table 63 presents dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of select Fc variants to V158 FcγRIIIa and F158 FcγRIIIa obtained using SPR, and compares these with IC50s obtained from the AlphaScreen™ assay. By dividing the Kd and IC50 for each variant by that of WT alemtuzumab, the fold-improvements over WT (Fold) are obtained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAlpha-\n\n\nAlpha-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSPR\n\n\nSPR\n\n\nScreen ™\n\n\nScreen ™\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV158\n\n\nF158\n\n\nV158\n\n\nF158\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFcγRIIIa\n\n\nFcγRIIIa\n\n\nFcγRIIIa\n\n\nFcγRIIIa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKd\n\n\n \n\n\nKd\n\n\n \n\n\nIC50\n\n\n \n\n\nIC50\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nFold\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nFold\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nFold\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nFold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWT\n\n\n68\n\n\n \n\n\n730\n\n\n \n\n\n6.4\n\n\n \n\n\n17.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV264I\n\n\n64\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n550\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n11.5\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI332E\n\n\n31\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n72\n\n\n10.1\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n6.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV264I/\nI332E\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n52\n\n\n14.0\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n12.8\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n15.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS298A\n\n\n52\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n285\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n12.0\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS298A/E333A/\n\n\n39\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n156\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK334A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SPR data corroborate the improvements to FcγRIIIa affinity observed by AlphaScreen™ assay. Table 63 further indicates the superiority of V264I/I332E and I332E over S298A and S298A/E333A/K334A; whereas S298A/E333A/K334A improves Fc binding to V158 and F158 FcγRIIIa by 1.7-fold and 4.7-fold respectively, I332E shows binding enhancements of 2.2-fold and 10.1-fold respectively, and V264I/I332E shows binding enhancements of 4.0-fold and 14-fold respectively. Also worth noting is that the affinity of V264I/I332E for F158 FcγRIIIa (52 nM) is better than that of WT for the V158 allotype (68 nM), suggesting that this Fc variant, as well as those with even greater improvements in binding, may enable the clinical efficacy of antibodies for the low responsive patient population to achieve that currently possible for high responders.

ADCC was measured using the DELFIA® EuTDA-based cytotoxicity assay (Perkin Elmer, MA) with purified human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) as effector cells. Target cells were loaded with BATDA at 1×10\n6 \ncells/ml, washed 4 times and seeded into 96-well plate at 10,000 cells/well. The target cells were then opsonized using Fc variant or WT antibodies at the indicated final concentration. Human PBMCs, isolated from buffy-coat were added at the indicated fold-excess of target cells and the plate was incubated at 37° C. for 4 hrs. The co-cultured cells were centrifuged at 500×g, supernatants were transferred to a separate plate and incubated with Eu solution, and relative fluorescence units were measured using a Packard Fusion™ α-FP HT reader (Packard Biosciences, IL). Samples were run in triplicate to provide error estimates (n=3, +/−S.D.). PBMCs were allotyped for the V158 or F158 FcγRIIIa allotype using PCR.\n\n\nADCC assays were run on Fc variant and WT alemtuzumab using DoHH-2 lymphoma target cells. \nFIG. 24\n \na \nis a bar graph showing the ADCC of these proteins at 10 ng/ml antibody. Results show that alemtuzumab Fc variants I332E, V264I, and I332E/V264I have substantially enhanced ADCC compared to WT alemtuzumab, with the relative ADCC enhancements proportional to their binding improvements to FcγRIIIa as indicated by AlphaScreen™ assay and SPR. The dose dependence of ADCC on antibody concentration is shown in \nFIG. 24\n \nb\n. The binding data were normalized to the minimum and maximum fluorescence signal for each particular curve, provided by the baselines at low and high antibody concentrations respectively. The data were fit to a sigmoidal dose-response model using nonlinear regression, represented by the curve in the figure. The fits enable determination of the \neffective concentration\n 50% (EC50) (i.e. the concentration required for 50% effectiveness), which provides the relative enhancements to ADCC for each Fc variant. The EC50s for these binding data are analogous to the IC50s obtained from the AlphaScreen™ competition data, and derivation of these values is thus analogous to that described in Example 2 and \nFIG. 11\n. In \nFIG. 24\n \nb\n, the log(EC50)s, obtained from the fits to the data, for WT, V264I/I332E, and S239D/I332E alemtuzumab are 0.99, 0.60, and 0.49 respectively, and therefore their respective EC50s are 9.9, 4.0, and 3.0. Thus V264I/I332E and S239E/I332E provide a 2.5-fold and 3.3-fold enhancement respectively in ADCC over WT alemtuzumab using PBMCs expressing heterozygous V158/F158 FcγRIIIa.

Furthermore, S239D/A330L/I332E provides a substantial ADCC enhancement, greater than 300-fold for PBMCs expressing homozygous F158/F158 FcγRIIa, relative to WT trastuzumab and S298A/E333A/K334A, consistent with the FcγR binding data observed by the AlphaScreen™ assay and SPR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nlog\n\n\n \n\n\nFold Improvement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(EC50)\n\n\nEC50 (ng/ml)\n\n\nOver WT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIG. 25b\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWT\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n11.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI332E\n\n\n0.34\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n5.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA330Y/I332E\n\n\n− 0.04\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n12.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA330L/I332E\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n10.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIG. 25d\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWT\n\n\n− 0.15\n\n\n0.71\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nS298A/E333A/K334A\n\n\n− 0.72\n\n\n0.20\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS239D/A330L/I332E\n\n\n− 2.65\n\n\n0.0022\n\n\n323\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADCC assays were run on V264I/I332E, WT, and S298A/D333A/K334A rituximab using WIL2-S lymphoma target cells. \nFIG. 26\n \na \npresents a bar graph showing the ADCC of these proteins at 1 ng/ml antibody.

The differences in ADCC enhancements observed for alemtuzumab, trastuzumab, and rituximab are likely due to the use of different PBMCs, different antibodies, and different target cell lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nlog\n\n\n \n\n\nFold Improvement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(EC50)\n\n\nEC50 (ng/ml)\n\n\nOver WT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIG. 26b\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWT\n\n\n0.23\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nS298A/E333A/K334A\n\n\n− 0.44\n\n\n0.37\n\n\n4.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV264I/I332E\n\n\n− 0.83\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n11.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIG. 26c\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWT\n\n\n0.77\n\n\n5.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nS239D/I332E/A330L\n\n\n− 2.20\n\n\n0.0063\n\n\n937\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus far, ADCC data has been normalized such that the lower and upper baselines of each Fc polypeptide are set to the minimal and maximal fluorescence signal for that specific Fc polypeptide, typically being the fluorescence signal at the lowest and highest antibody concentrations respectively. Although presenting the data in this matter enables a straightforward visual comparison of the relative EC50s of different antibodies (hence the reason for presenting them in this way), important information regarding the absolute level of effector function achieved by each Fc polypeptide is lost. \nFIGS. 27\n \na \nand \n27\n \nb \npresent cell-based ADCC data for trastuzumab and rituximab respectively that have been normalized according to the absolute minimal lysis for the assay, provided by the fluorescence signal of target cells in the presence of PBMCs alone (no antibody), and the absolute maximal lysis for the assay, provided by the fluorescence signal of target cells in the presence of Triton X1000. The graphs show that the antibodies differ not only in their EC50, reflecting their relative potency, but also in the maximal level of ADCC attainable by the antibodies at saturating concentrations, reflecting their relative efficacy. Thus far these two terms, potency and efficacy, have been used loosely to refer to desired clinical properties. In the current experimental context, however, they are denoted as specific quantities, and therefore are here explicitly defined. By “potency” as used in the current experimental context is meant the EC50 of an antibody or Fc fusion. By “efficacy” as used in the current experimental context is meant the maximal possible effector function of an antibody or Fc fusion at saturating levels. In addition to the substantial enhancements to potency described thus far, \nFIGS. 27\n \na \nand \n27\n \nb \nshow that the Fc variants of the present invention provide greater than 100% enhancements in efficacy over WT trastuzumab and rituximab.\n\n\nA critical parameter governing the clinical efficacy of anti-cancer antibodies is the expression level of target antigen on the surface of tumor cells. Thus a major clinical advantage of Fc variants that enhance ADCC may be that it enables the targeting of tumors that express lower levels of antigen. In To test this hypothesis, WT and Fc variant trastuzumab antibodies were tested for their ability to mediate ADCC against different cell lines expressing varying levels of the Her2/neu target antigen. ADCC assays were run with various cell lines expressing amplified to low levels of Her2/neu receptor, including Sk-Br-3 (1×10\n6 \ncopies), SkOV3 (˜1×10\n5\n), OVCAR3(˜1×10\n4\n), and MCF-7 (˜3×10\n3 \ncopies), using the DELFIA EuTDA Cytotoxicity kit (PerkinElmer, Boston, Mass.). Target cells were loaded with BATDA in batch for 25 minutes, washed multiple times with medium and seeded at 10,000 cells per well in 96-well plates. Target cells were opsonized for 15 minutes with various antibodies and concentrations (final conc. ranging from 100 ng/ml to 0.0316 ng/ml in ½ log steps, including no treatment control). Human PBMCs, isolated from buffy-coat and allotyped as homozygous F158/F158 FcγRIIIa were then added to opsonized cells at 25-fold excess and co-cultured at 37° C. for 4 hrs. Thereafter, plates were centrifuged, supernatants were removed and treated with Eu3+ solution, and relative fluorescence units (correlating to the level of cell lysis) were measured using a Packard Fusion™ α-FP HT reader (PerkinElmer, Boston, Mass.). The experiment was carried out in triplicates. \nFIG. 28\n shows the ADCC data comparing WT and Fc variant trastuzumab against the four different Her2/neu\n+\n cell lines. The S239D/I332E and S239D/I332E/A330L variants provide substantial ADCC enhancements over WT trastuzumab at high, moderate, and low expression levels of target antigen. This result suggests that the Fc variants of the present invention may broaden the therapeutic window of anti-cancer antibodies.\n\n\nNatural killer (NK) cells are a subpopulation of cells present in PBMCs that are thought to play a significant role in ADCC. Select Fc variants were tested in a cell-based ADCC assay in which natural killer (NK) cells rather than PBMCs were used as effector cells. In this assay the release of endogenous lactose dehydrogenase (LDH), rather than EuTDA, was used to monitor cell lysis. \nFIG. 29\n shows that the Fc variants show substantial ADCC enhancement when NK cells are used as effector cells. Furthermore, together with previous assays, the results indicate that the Fc variants of the present invention show substantial ADCC enhancements regardless of the type of effector cell or the detection method used.\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nADCP of Fc Variants\n\n\nAnother important FcγR-mediated effector function is ADCP. Phagocytosis of target cancer cells may not only lead to the immediate destruction of target cells, but because phagocytosis is a potential mechanism for antigen uptake and processing by antigen presenting cells, enhanced ADCP may also improve the capacity of the antibody or Fc fusion to elicit an adaptive immune response. The ability of the Fc variants of the present invention to mediate ADCP was therefore investigated. Monocytes were isolated from heterozygous V158/F158 FcγRIIIa PBMCs using a Percoll gradient. After one week in culture in the presence of 0.1 ng/ml, differentiated macrophages were detached with EDTA/PBS- and labeled with the lipophilic fluorophore, PKH26, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma, St Louis, Mo.). Sk-Br-3 target cells were labeled with PKH67 (Sigma, St Louis, Mo.), seeded in a 96-well plate at 20,000 cells per well, and treated with designated final concentrations of WT or Fc variant trastuzumab. PKH26-labeled macrophages were then added to the opsonized, labeled Sk-Br-3 cells at 20,000 cells per well and the cells were co-cultured for 18 hrs before processing cells for analysis of dual label flow cytometry. Percent phagocytosis was determined as the number of cells co-labeled with PKH76 and PKH26 (macrophage+Sk-Br-3) over the total number of Sk-Br-3 in the population (phagocytosed+non-phagocytosed) after 10,000 counts. \nFIG. 30\n shows data comparing WT and Fc variant trastuzumab at various antibody concentrations. The results indicate that the S239D/I332E/A330L variant provides a significant enhancement in ADCP over WT trastuzumab.\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nComplement Binding and Activation by Fc Variants\n\n\nComplement protein C1q binds to a site on Fc that is proximal to the FcγR binding site, and therefore it was prudent to determine whether the Fc variants have maintained their capacity to recruit and activate complement. The AlphaScreen™ assay was used to measure binding of select Fc variants to the complement protein C1q. The assay was carried out with biotinylated WT alemtuzumab antibody attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2, and using C1q coupled directly to acceptor beads. Binding data of V264, I332E, S239E, and V264I/I332E rituximab shown in \nFIG. 31\n \na \nindicate that C1q binding is uncompromised. Cell-based CDC assays were also performed on select Fc variants to investigate whether Fc variants maintain the capacity to activate complement. Alamar Blue was used to monitor lysis of Fc variant and WT rituximab-opsonized WIL2-S lymphoma cells by human serum complement (Quidel, San Diego, Calif.). The data in \nFIG. 31\n \nb \nshow that CDC is uncompromised for the Fc variants S239E, V264I, and V264I/I332E rituximab. In contrast, \nFIG. 31\n \nc \nshows that CDC of the Fc variant S239D/I332E/A330L is completely ablated, whereas the S239D/I332E variant mediates CDC that is comparable to WT rituximab. These results indicate that protein engineering can be used to distinguish between different effector functions. Such control will not only enable the generation of antibodies and Fc fusions with properties tailored for a desired clinical outcome, but also provide a unique set of reagents with which to experimentally investigate effector function biology.\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\nProtein A and FcRn Binding by Fc Variants\n\n\nAs discussed, bacterial proteins A and G and the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn bind to the Fc region between the Cγ2 and Cγ3 domains. Protein A is frequently employed for antibody purification, and FcRn plays a key role in antibody pharmacokinetics and transport. It was therefore important to investigate the ability of the Fc variants of the present invention to bind protein A and FcRn. The AlphaScreen™ assay was used to measure binding of select Fc variants to protein A and human FcRn using biotinylated WT alemtuzumab antibody attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2, and using protein A and FcRn coupled directly to acceptor beads. The binding data are shown in \nFIG. 32\n for protein A and \nFIG. 33\n for FcRn. The results indicate that the Cγ2-Cγ3 hinge region is unaffected by the Fc substitutions, and importantly that the capacity of the Fc variants to bind protein A and FcRn is uncompromised.\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\nCapacity of Fc Variants to Bind Mouse FcγRs\n\n\nOptimization of Fc to nonhuman FcγRs may be useful for experimentally testing Fc variants in animal models. For example, when tested in mice (for example nude mice, SCID mice, xenograft mice, and/or transgenic mice), antibodies and Fc fusions that comprise Fc variants that are optimized for one or more mouse FcγRs may provide valuable information with regard to clinical efficacy, mechanism of action, and the like. In order to evaluate whether the Fc variants of the present invention may be useful in such experiments, affinity of select Fc variants for mouse FcγRIII was measured using the AlphaScreen™ assay. The AlphaScreen™ assay was carried out using biotinylated WT alemtuzumab attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2, and GST-tagged mouse FcγRIII bound to glutathione chelate acceptor beads, expressed and purified as described in Example 2. These binding data are shown in \nFIGS. 34\n \na \nand \n34\n \nb \nin the context of alemtuzumab and trastuzumab respectively. Results show that some Fc variants that enhance binding to human FcγRIIIa also enhance binding to mouse FcγRIII. The enhancement of mouse effector function by the Fc variants was investigated by performing the aforementioned cell-based ADCC assays using mouse rather than human PBMC's. \nFIG. 35\n shows that the S239D/I332E/A330L trastuzumab variant provides substantial ADCC enhancement over WT in the presence of mouse immune cells. This result indicates that the Fc variants of the present invention, or other Fc variants that are optimized for nonhuman FcγRs, may find use in experiments that use animal models.\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\nValidation of Fc Variants Expressed in CHO Cells\n\n\nWhereas the Fc variants of the present invention were expressed in 293T cells for screening purposes, large scale production of antibodies is typically carried out by expression in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines. In order to evaluate the properties of CHO-expressed Fc variants, select Fc variants and WT alemtuzumab were expressed in CHO cells and purified as described in Example 2. \nFIG. 36\n shows AlphaScreen™ data comparing binding of CHO- and 293T-expressed Fc variant and WT alemtuzumab to human V158 FcγRIIIa. The results indicate that the Fc variants of the present invention show comparable FcγR binding enhancements whether expressed in 293T or CHO.\n\n\nExample 13\n\n\nEnhancement of Fc Variants in Fucose Minus Strain\n\n\nCombinations of the Fc variants of the present invention with other Fc modifications are contemplated with the goal of generating novel antibodies or Fc fusions with optimized properties. It may be beneficial to combine the Fc variants of the present invention with other Fc modifications, including modifications that alter effector function or interaction with one or more Fc ligands. Such combination may provide additive, synergistic, or novel properties in antibodies or Fc fusions. For example, a number of methods exist for engineering different glycoforms of Fc that alter effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by a variety of methods known in the art, many of these techniques are based on controlling the level of fucosylated and/or bisecting oligosaccharides that are covalently attached to the Fc region. One method for engineering Fc glycoforms is to express the Fc polypeptide in a cell line that generates altered glycoforms, for example Lec-13 CHO cells. In order to investigate the properties of Fc variants combined with engineered glycoforms, WT and V209 (S239D/I332E/A330L) trastuzumab were expressed in Lec-13 CHO cells and purified as described above. \nFIG. 37\n \na \nshows AlphaScreen™ binding data comparing the binding to human V158 FcγRIIIa by WT and V209 trastuzumab expressed in 293T, CHO, and Lec-13 cells. The results show that there is substantial synergy between the engineered glycoforms produced by this cell line and the Fc variants of the present invention. The cell-based ADCC assay, shown in \nFIG. 37\n \nb\n, supports this result. Together these data indicate that other Fc modifications, particularly engineered glycoforms, may be combined with the Fc variants of the present invention to generate antibodies and Fc fusions with optimized effector functions.\n\n\nExample 14\n\n\nTherapeutic Application of Fc Variants\n\n\nA number of Fc variants described in the present invention have significant potential for improving the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer antibodies. For illustration purposes, a number of Fc variants of the present invention have been incorporated into the sequence of the antibody rituximab. The WT rituximab light chain and heavy chain, described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,137, are provided in \nFIGS. 38\n \na \nand \n38\n \nb\n. The improved anti-CD20 antibody sequences are provided in \nFIG. 38\n \nc\n. The improved anti-CD20 antibody sequences comprise at least non-WT amino acid selected from the group consisting of X\n1\n, X\n2\n, X\n3\n, X\n4\n, X\n5\n, X\n6\n, X\n7\n, and X\n8\n. These improved anti-CD20 antibody sequences may also comprise a substitution Z\n1 \nand/or Z\n2\n. The use of rituximab here is solely an example, and is not meant to constrain application of the Fc variants to this antibody or any other particular antibody or Fc fusion.\n\n\nExample 15\n\n\nA complete Structure/Function Analysis Fc/Fc Ligand Specificity\n\n\nIt is clear from the results of these experiments that protein engineering is a powerful tool for mining Fc substitutions that significantly alter its biological function and specificity. Given the profound clinical value of antibodies and Fc fusions, the implication is that the protein engineering methods of the present invention can be used to tune the clinical properties of these important biotherapeutics. Such capability, however, demands a more complete understanding of the relationship between the structure and function of Fc and Fc ligands. In addition, the lack of available information on the determinants of Fc/Fc ligand specificity means that it is not possible to actively design Fc variants with all desired properties as target goals. Thus it is likely that, despite the aggressive experimental effort described in the present invention, there are therapeutically useful Fc variants that have not been mined, and biochemical properties of Fc variants that remain undiscovered. Equally important to obtaining new Fc variants for biotherapeutic application is the ability to improve the predictiveness of the design method, thereby permitting variants to be identified even more efficiently. Towards these goals, a more thorough characterization of Fc/Fc ligand biology was carried out. This included: 1) an expansion of the primary screen to include all relevant Fc ligands, and 2) an increase in the number of Fc variants to explore a greater set of substitutions at all relevant Fc positions. Together this broadened approach will enable a more thorough mining of useful Fc variants, provide a greater understanding of Fc/Fc ligand specificity and biology, and provide a greater data set to enable a rigorous quantitative assessment of the predictiveness of the design methods.\n\n\nExpansion of the Primary Screen\n\n\nIn order to better characterize the structural and functional determinants of Fc specificity, the primary screen was expanded to include all relevant Fc ligands. Thus all Fc variants are tested in parrallel for binding to FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIc, FcγRIIIa (Val158 isoform), FcRn, and C1q. The AlphaScreen™ assay was used as described above. All Fc variants were screened in the context of either alemtuzumab or trastuzumab according to Table 62. Table 68 shows an example of the parrallel screen for a set of substitutions at Fc positions 234 and 235. In this table, light grey indicates that Fc variant/Fc ligand affinity is 0.5-fold or less than WT, medium grey indicates that Fc variant/Fc ligand affinity is within 0.5-2.0 of WT, dark grey indicates that Fc variant/Fc ligand affinity is increased by 2-fold or greater, and white indicates that the Fc variant/Fc ligand interaction was not measured or that the data did not allow an accurate determination of affinity. Thus Fc variants are grouped as those that significantly decrease, those that do not substantially alter, and those that significantly increase binding to a given Fc ligand. Visualization of the data in this way provides a structure/function map of Fc, enabling a straightforward interpretation of the results for each position such that useful and interesting variants can be efficiently identified, and such that predictiveness of the design method can be assessed in a practical manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariant\n\n\nSubstitution(s)\n\n\nFcγRI\n\n\nFcγRIIa\n\n\nFcγRIIb\n\n\nFcγRIIc\n\n\nFcγRIIIa\n\n\nFcRn\n\n\nC1q\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n111\n\n\nL234D\n\n\n0.54\n\n\n1.28\n\n\n2.91\n\n\n2.99\n\n\n2.88\n\n\n1.60\n\n\n1.69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n112\n\n\nL234E\n\n\n0.51\n\n\n0.71\n\n\n1.65\n\n\n1.85\n\n\n2.05\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n1.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n113\n\n\nL234N\n\n\n0.11\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n0.90\n\n\n1.11\n\n\n0.20\n\n\n1.64\n\n\n1.02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n114\n\n\nL234Q\n\n\n0.22\n\n\n1.51\n\n\n2.25\n\n\n2.18\n\n\n0.11\n\n\n3.73\n\n\n0.48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n115\n\n\nL234T\n\n\n0.18\n\n\n0.95\n\n\n1.19\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n0.25\n\n\n0.99\n\n\n1.73\n\n\n\n\n\n\n116\n\n\nL234H\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n1.75\n\n\n3.24\n\n\n1.32\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n1.01\n\n\n1.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n117\n\n\nL234Y\n\n\n0.36\n\n\n0.99\n\n\n1.06\n\n\n1.82\n\n\n0.51\n\n\n0.78\n\n\n1.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n118\n\n\nL234I\n\n\n0.48\n\n\n1.12\n\n\n1.38\n\n\n0.60\n\n\n0.76\n\n\n1.30\n\n\n1.97\n\n\n\n\n\n\n119\n\n\nL234V\n\n\n0.86\n\n\n1.81\n\n\n3.23\n\n\n0.93\n\n\n1.83\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n1.39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n120\n\n\nL234F\n\n\n0.13\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n1.20\n\n\n0.35\n\n\n0.25\n\n\n1.02\n\n\n1.94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n121\n\n\nL235D\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n0.90\n\n\n1.51\n\n\n0.71\n\n\n1.88\n\n\n0.77\n\n\n1.26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n122\n\n\nL235S\n\n\n0.12\n\n\n0.74\n\n\n1.61\n\n\n0.64\n\n\n0.85\n\n\n0.99\n\n\n1.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n123\n\n\nL235N\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n0.77\n\n\n1.56\n\n\n0.76\n\n\n0.34\n\n\n1.10\n\n\n1.46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n124\n\n\nL235Q\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n0.82\n\n\n2.38\n\n\n0.82\n\n\n0.89\n\n\n0.89\n\n\n1.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n125\n\n\nL235T\n\n\n0.10\n\n\n0.63\n\n\n1.39\n\n\n0.72\n\n\n1.40\n\n\n0.93\n\n\n0.92\n\n\n\n\n\n\n126\n\n\nL235H\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n1.27\n\n\n3.86\n\n\n1.72\n\n\n0.14\n\n\n0.88\n\n\n1.19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n127\n\n\nL235Y\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n0.79\n\n\n2.43\n\n\n0.61\n\n\n1.09\n\n\n0.58\n\n\n1.50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n128\n\n\nL235I\n\n\n0.20\n\n\n0.24\n\n\n1.91\n\n\n0.22\n\n\n1.16\n\n\n1.24\n\n\n0.68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n129\n\n\nL235V\n\n\n0.22\n\n\n8.80\n\n\n3.69\n\n\n2.59\n\n\n0.91\n\n\n2.70\n\n\n1.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n130\n\n\nL235F\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n18.07\n\n\n1.78\n\n\n1.31\n\n\n0.79\n\n\n0.92\n\n\n1.26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of substitutions at positions 234 and 235 show different specificities for binding to the various Fc ligands. Although the differences in some cases are subtle, the results indicate that it is indeed possible to engineer Fc specificity for different Fc ligands, even at the FcγR interface where a number of highly homologous receptors bind to the same site. Other Fc variants that provide more distinct affinity differences are presented in Table 69.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariant\n\n\nSubstitution(s)\n\n\nFcγRI\n\n\nFcγRIIa\n\n\nFcγRIIb\n\n\nFcγRIIc\n\n\nFcγRIIIa\n\n\nFcRn\n\n\nC1q\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n107\n\n\nA330Y/I332E\n\n\n3.14\n\n\n5.40\n\n\n2.90\n\n\n3.84\n\n\n19.83\n\n\n2.85\n\n\n1.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n109\n\n\nA330L/I332E\n\n\n6.44\n\n\n1.58\n\n\n1.16\n\n\n1.58\n\n\n21.23\n\n\n5.36\n\n\n1.08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n167\n\n\nL328E/I332E\n\n\n0.91\n\n\n8.50\n\n\n5.54\n\n\n10.21\n\n\n3.85\n\n\n0.31\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n171\n\n\nL328T/I332E\n\n\n1.42\n\n\n3.07\n\n\n10.28\n\n\n22.69\n\n\n4.51\n\n\n0.84\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n174\n\n\nL328A\n\n\n0.80\n\n\n4.24\n\n\n1.08\n\n\n1.11\n\n\n0.84\n\n\n1.06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese data show even more convincingly that it is possible to tune Fc for Fc ligand specificity, often by using very subtle mutational differences. For example, the A330Y/I332E variant enhances binding to all FcγRs, particularly FcγRIIa, as well as FcRn, while maintaining binding to C1q. However the A300L/I332E variant shows enhanced binding to FcγRI and FcγRIIa, but has WT affinity for the FcγRII's. In contrast, mutations at L328 provide preferential enhancement of the FcγRII's over FcγRI and FcγRIIa. In the case of the L328E/I332E variant, affinity for all FcγRII's is increased, whereas L328T/I332E provides a clear enhancement specificity profile of FcγRIIc>FcγRIIb>FcγRIIa. In contrast, L328A significantly enhances binding to FcγRIIa, but provides WT affinity for all other FcγR's including FcγRIIb and FcγRIIc. It is clear from these results that very subtle mutational differences can provide substantial differences in specificity. Accordingly, collections of Fc variants such as these will not only enable the generation of antibodies and Fc fusions that have effector function tailored for the desired outcome, but they also provide a unique set of reagents with which to experimentally investigate and characterize effector function biology.\n\n\nExpansion of the Fc Variant Set\n\n\nBecause of the incomplete information concerning the structural and functional determinants of Fc/Fc ligand interaction, it has not been possible to actively engineer Fc for all desired optimization goals. The distinct specificity differences observed in Tables 68 and 69 to the various FcγRs were due more to the aggressive screening approach of the present invention; these Fc variants were not actively designed with their particular properties as the target goals due to the lack of structural information for binding of Fc to the different FcγRs, as well as the lack of understanding of how the structure and flexibility of the hinge impacts FcγR binding. Indeed the decision to explore a large number and variety of substitutions at these positions 234 and 235 was based on the knowledge that they are near the Fc/FcγR binding site, that mutations at these positions affect FcγR binding, and that according to computational screening calculations a large number and variety of substitutions are permissible at these positions. Overall, the lack of structural information on the determinants of Fc/FcγR specificity, the lack of high-resolution structural information for the Fc/C1q complex, and the inability to account for indirect affects of substitutions on Fc/Fc ligand binding, together make it a certainty that all of the interesting and potentially useful Fc variants will not be explored using the current engineering methods. In order to fully mine useful Fc variants, as well as to obtain a more complete picture of the structural and function determinants of Fc/Fc ligand interaction, the set of Fc variants was expanded to explore a broader set of mutations. All Fc positions at or near the binding sites for FcγR's and C1q, chosen by visual inspection of the available structures and using the information provided by the results of previous Fc variant screening, were saturated such that all substitutions were constructed that have not been tested previously. At Fc positions significantly distal to the FcγR and C1q binding sites, a subset of select substitutions were designed based on predicted energies in previously described computational screening calculations, and based on available data from existing Fc variants. This new set of Fc variants, 576 total, is presented in Table 70.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 70\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition\n\n\nWT\n\n\nSubstitution(s)\n\n\nVariant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

No. 6,432,975, each of which is fully incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions incorporating compounds capable of affecting nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptors (nAChRs), for example, as modulators of specific nicotinic receptor subtypes (specifically, the α7 nAChR subtype). The present invention also relates to methods for treating a wide variety of conditions and disorders, particularly those associated with dysfunction of the central and autonomic nervous systems.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nNicotine has been proposed to have a number of pharmacological effects. See, for example, Pullan et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n330:811 (1994). Certain of those effects may be related to effects upon neurotransmitter release. See, for example, Sjak-shie et al., \nBrain Res. \n624:295 (1993), where neuroprotective effects of nicotine are proposed. Release of acetylcholine and dopamine by neurons, upon administration of nicotine, has been reported by Rowell et al., \nJ. Neurochem. \n43:1593 (1984); Rapier et al., \nJ. Neurochem. \n50:1123 (1988); Sandor et al., \nBrain Res. \n567:313 (1991) and Vizi, Br. \nJ. Pharmacol. \n47:765 (1973), Release of norepinephrine by neurons, upon administration of nicotine, has been reported by Hall et al., \nBiochem. Pharmacol. \n21:1829 (1972). Release of serotonin by neurons, upon administration of nicotine, has been reported by Hery et al., \nArch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. \n296:91 (1977). Release of glutamate by neurons, upon administration of nicotine, has been reported by Toth et al., \nNeurochem Res. \n17:265 (1992). Confirmatory reports and additional recent studies have included the modulation, in the central nervous system (CNS), of glutamate, nitric oxide, GABA, tachykinins, cytokines, and peptides (reviewed in Brioni et al., \nAdv. Pharmacol. \n37:153 (1997)). In addition, nicotine reportedly potentiates the pharmacological behavior of certain pharmaceutical compositions used for the treatment of certain disorders. See, for example, Sanberg et al., \nPharmacol. Biochem\n. & \nBehavior \n46:303 (1993); Harsing et al., \nJ. Neurochem. \n59:48 (1993) and Hughes, \nProceedings from Intl. Symp. Nic. S\n40 (1994). Furthermore, various other beneficial pharmacological effects of nicotine have been proposed. See, for example, Decina et al., \nBiol. Psychiatry \n28:502 (1990); Wagner et al., \nPharmacopsychiatry \n21:301 (1988); Pomerleau et al., \nAddictive Behaviors \n9:265 (1984); Onaivi et al., \nLife Sci. \n54(3):193 (1994); Tripathi et al., \nJPET \n221:91(1982) and Hamon, \nTrends in Pharmacol. Res. \n15:36 (1994).\n\n\nVarious compounds that target nAChRs have been reported as being useful for treating a wide variety of conditions and disorders. See, for example, Williams et al., \nDN\n&\nP \n7(4):205 (1994); Arneric et al., \nCNS Drug Rev. \n1(1):1 (1995); Arneric et al., \nExp. Opin. Invest.

Nicotinic compounds are reported as being particularly useful for treating a wide variety of CNS disorders. Indeed, a wide variety of compounds have been reported to have therapeutic properties. Seep for example, Bencherif and Schmitt, \nCurrent Drug Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders \n1(4): 349 (2002), Levin and Rezvani, \nCurrent Drug Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders \n1(4): 423 (2002), O'Neill et al., \nCurrent Drug Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders \n1(4): 399 (2002), U.S. Pat. No. 5,1871,166 to Kikuchi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,601 to Cignarella, PCT WO 99/21834, and PCT WO 97/40049, UK Patent Application GB 2295387, and European Patent Application 297,858.\n\n\nCNS disorders are a type of neurological disorder. CNS disorders can be drug induced; can be attributed to genetic predisposition, infection or trauma; or can be of unknown etiology. CNS disorders comprise neuropsychiatric disorders, neurological diseases and mental illnesses, and include neurodegenerative diseases, behavioral disorders, cognitive disorders and cognitive affective disorders. There are several CNS disorders whose clinical manifestations have been attributed to CNS dysfunction (i.e., disorders resulting from inappropriate levels of neurotransmitter release, inappropriate properties of neurotransmitter receptors, and/or inappropriate interaction between neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter receptors). Several CNS disorders can be attributed to a deficiency of choline, dopamine, norepinephrine and/or serotonin. Relatively common CNS disorders include pre-senile dementia (early-onset Alzheimer's disease), senile dementia (dementia of the Alzheimer's type), micro-infarct dementia, AIDS-related dementia, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, Pick's disease, Parkinsonism including Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington's chorea, tardive dyskinesia, hyperkinesia, mania, attention deficit disorder, anxiety, dyslexia, schizophrenia, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders and Tourette's syndrome.\n\n\nThe nAChRs characteristic of the CNS have been shown to occur in several subtypes, the most common of which are the α4β2 and α7 subtypes. See, for example, Schmitt, \nCurrent Med. Chem. \n7: 749 (2000). Ligands that interact with the α7 nAChR subtype have been proposed to be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia. There are a decreased number of hippocampal nAChRs in postmortem brain tissue of schizophrenic patients. Also, there is improved psychological effect in smoking versus non-smoking schizophrenic patients. Nicotine improves sensory gating deficits in animals and schizophrenics. Blockade of the α7 nAChR subtype induces a gating deficit similar to that seen in schizophrenia. See, for example, Leonard et al., \nSchizophrenia Bulletin \n22(3): 431 (1996). Biochemical, molecular, and genetic studies of sensory processing, in patients with the P50 auditory-evoked potential gating deficit, suggest that the α7 nAChR subtype may function in an inhibitory neuronal pathway. See, for example, Freedman et al., \nBiological Psychiatry \n38(1):22 (1995).\n\n\nMore recently, α7 nAChRs have been proposed to be mediators of angiogenesis, as described by Heeschen et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n100: 527 (2002). In these studies, inhibition of the α7 subtype was shown to decrease inflammatory angiogenesis. Also, α7 nAChRS have been proposed as targets for controlling neurogenesis and tumor growth (Utsugisawa et al., \nMolecular Brain Research \n106(1-2): 88 (2002) and U.S. Patent Application 2002/0016371). Finally, the role of the α7 subtype in cognition (Levin and Rezvani, \nCurrent Drug Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders \n1(4): 423 (2002)), neuroprotection (O'Neill et al., \nCurrent Drug Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders \n1(4): 399 (2002) and Jeyarasasingam et al., \nNeuroscience \n109(2): 275 (2002)), and neuropathic pain (Xiao et al., \nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci\n. (\nUS\n) 99(12): 8360 (2002)) has recently been recognized.\n\n\nVarious compounds have been reported to interact with α7 nAChRs and have been proposed as therapies on that basis. See, for instance, PCT WO 99/62505, PCT WO 99/03859, PCT WO 97/30998, PCT WO 01/36417, PCT WO 02/15662, PCT WO 02/16355, PCT WO 02/16356, PCT WO 02/16357, PCT WO 02/16358, PCT WO 02/17358, Stevens et al., \nPsychopharm. \n136: 320 (1998), Dolle et al., \nJ. Labelled Comp. Radiopharm. \n44: 785 (2001) and Macor et al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. \n11: 319 (2001) and references therein. Among these compounds, a common structural theme is that of the substituted tertiary bicylic amine (e.g., quinuclidine). Similar substituted quinuclidine compounds have also been reported to bind at muscarinic receptors. See, for instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,270 to Sabb and PCTs WO 02/00652 and WO 02/051841.\n\n\nIt would be desirable to provide a useful method for the prevention and treatment of a condition or disorder by administering a nicotinic compound to a patient susceptible to or suffering from such a condition or disorder. It would be highly beneficial to provide individuals suffering from certain disorders (e.g., CNS diseases) with interruption of the symptoms of those disorders by the administration of a pharmaceutical composition containing an active ingredient having nicotinic pharmacology which has a beneficial effect (e.g., upon the functioning of the CNS), but does not provide any significant associated side effects. It would be highly desirable to provide a pharmaceutical composition incorporating a compound that interacts with nAChRs, such as those that have the potential to affect the functioning of the CNS. It would be highly desirable that such a compound, when employed in an amount sufficient to affect the functioning of the CNS, would not significantly affect those nAChR subtypes that have the potential to induce undesirable side effects (e.g., appreciable activity at cardiovascular and skeletal muscle receptor sites). In addition, it would be highly desirable to provide a pharmaceutical composition incorporating a compound which interacts with nicotinic receptors but not muscarinic receptors, as the latter are associated with side effects, such as hypersalivation, sweating, tremors, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disturbances, related to the function of the parasympathetic nervous system (see Caulfield, \nPharmacol. Ther. \n58: 319 (1993) and Broadley and Kelly, \nMolecules \n6: 142 (2001)). Furthermore, it would be highly desirable to provide pharmaceutical compositions, which are selective for the α7 nAChR subtype, for the treatment of certain conditions or disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, cognitive disorders, and neuropathic pain) and for the prevention of tissue damage and the hastening of healing (i.e., for neuroprotection and the control of angiogenesis). The present invention provides such compounds, compositions and methods.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to 3-substituted-2-(arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes, pharmaceutical compositions including the compounds, methods of preparing the compounds, and methods of treatment using the compounds. More specifically, the methods of treatment involve modulating the activity of the α7 nAChR subtype by administering one or more of the compounds to treat or prevent disorders mediated by the α7 nAChR subtype.\n\n\nThe azabicycloalkanes generally are azabicycloheptanes, azabicyclooctanes, or azabicyclononanes. The aryl group in the arylalkyl moiety is a 5- or 6-membered ring heteroaromatic, preferably 3-pyridinyl and 5-pyrimidinyl moieties, and the alkyl group is typically a C\n1-4 \nalkyl. The substituent at the 3-position of the 1-azabicycloalkane is a carbonyl-containing functional group, such as an amide, carbamate, urea, thioamide, thiocarbamate, thiourea or similar functionality.\n\n\nThe compounds are beneficial in therapeutic applications requiring a selective interaction at certain nAChR subtypes. That is, the compounds modulate the activity of certain nAChR subtypes, particularly the α7 nAChR subtype, and do not have appreciable activity toward muscarinic receptors. The compounds can be administered in amounts sufficient to affect the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS) without significantl\ny \naffecting those receptor subtypes that have the potential to induce undesirable aide effects (e.g., without appreciable activity at ganglionic and skeletal muscle nAChR sites and at muscarinic receptors). The compounds are therefore useful towards modulating release of ligands involved in neurotransmission, without appreciable side effects.\n\n\nThe compounds can be used as therapeutic agents to treat and/or prevent disorders characterized by an alteration in normal neurotransmitter release. Examples of such disorders include certain CNS conditions and disorders. The compounds can provide neuroprotection, treat patients susceptible to convulsions, treat depression, autism, and certain neuroendocrine disorders, and help manage stroke patients. The compounds also are useful in treating hypertension, type II diabetes and neoplasia and effecting weight loss. As the compounds are selective for the α7 nAChR subtype, they can be used to treat certain conditions or disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, cognitive disorders, and neuropathic pain), prevent tissue damage, and hasten healing (i.e., provide neuroprotection and control of angiogenesis).\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions provide therapeutic benefit to individuals suffering from such conditions or disorders and exhibiting clinical manifestations of such conditions or disorders. The compounds, administered with the pharmaceutical compositions, can be employed in effective amounts to (i) exhibit nicotinic pharmacology and affect relevant nAChR sites (e.g., act as a pharmacological agonists at nicotinic receptors), and (ii) modulate neurotransmitter secretion, and hence prevent and suppress the symptoms associated with those diseases. In addition, the compounds have the potential to (i) increase the number of nAChRs of the brain of the patient, (ii) exhibit neuroprotective effects and (iii) when employed in effective amounts, not cause appreciable adverse side effects (e.g., significant increases in blood pressure and heart rate, significant negative effects upon the gastro-intestinal tract, and significant effects upon skeletal muscle). The pharmaceutical compositions are believed to be safe and effective with regards to prevention and treatment of various conditions or disorders.\n\n\nThe foregoing and other aspects of the present invention are explained in detail in the detailed description and examples set forth below.\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe compounds described herein have structures that are represented by Formulas 1 and 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Formulas 1 and 2, m and n individually can have a value of 1 or 2, and p can have a value of 1, 2, 3 or 4. In the Formulas, X is either oxygen or nitrogen (i.e., NR′), Y is either oxygen or sulfur, and Z is either nitrogen (i.e., NR′), a covalent bond or a linker species, A. A is selected from the group —CR′R″—, —CR′R″—CR′R″—, —CR′═CR′—, and —C\n2\n—, wherein R′ and R″ are as hereinafter defined. When Z is a covalent bond or A, X must be nitrogen. Ar is an aryl group, either carbocyclic or heterocyclic, either monocyclic or fused polycyclic, unsubstituted or substituted; and Cy is a 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic ring, unsubstituted or substituted. The wavy lines indicate that both relative and absolute stereochemistry at those sites are variable (e.g., cis or trans, R or S). The invention further includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds have one or more asymmetric carbons and can therefore exist in the form of racemic mixtures, enantiomers and diastereomers. In addition, some of the compounds exist as E and Z isomers about a carbon-carbon double bond. All these individual isomeric compounds and their mixtures are also intended to be within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nThus, the invention includes compounds in which Ar is linked to the azabicycle by a carbonyl group-containing functionality, such as an amide, carbamate, urea, thioamide, thiocarbamate or thiourea functionality. In addition, in the case of the amide and thioamide functionalities, Ar may be bonded directly to the carbonyl (or thiocarbonyl) group or may be linked to the carbonyl (oir thiocarbonyl) group through linker A. Furthermore, the invention includes compounds that contain a 1-azabicycle, containing either a 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring arid having a total of 7, 8 or 9 ring atoms (e.g., 1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, 1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, and 1-azabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane).\n\n\nAs used herein, “alkoxy” includes alkyl groups from 1 to 8 carbon atoms in a straight or branched chain, also C\n3-8 \ncycloalkyl, bonded to an oxygen atom.\n\n\nAs used herein, “alkyl” includes straight chain and branched C\n1-8 \nalkyl, preferably C\n1-6 \nalkyl. “Substituted alkyl” defines alkyl substituents with 1-3 substituents as defined below in connection with Ar and Cy.\n\n\nAs used herein, “arylalkyl” refers to moieties, such as benzyl, wherein an aromatic is linked to an alkyl group which is linked to the indicated position in the compound of Formulas 1 or 2. “Substituted arylalkyl” defines arylalkyl substituents with 1-3 substituents as defined below in connection with Ar and Cy.\n\n\nAs used herein, “aromatic” refers to 3- to 10-membered, preferably 5- and 6-membered, aromatic and heteroaromatic rings and polycyclic aromatics including 5- and/or 6-membered aromatic and/or heteroaromatic rings.\n\n\nAs used herein, “aryl” includes both carbocyclic and heterocyclic aromatic rings, both monocyclic and fused polycyclic, where the aromatic rings can be 5- or 6-membered rings.

Stimulation is defined in the context of the particular assay, or may be apparent in the literature from a discussion herein that makes a comparison to a factor or substance that is accepted as an “agonist” or an “antagonist” of the particular binding partner under substantially similar circumstances as appreciated by those of skill in the art. Stimulation may be defined with respect to an increase in a particular effect or function that is induced by interaction of the agonist or partial agonist with a binding partner and can include allosteric effects.\n\n\nAs used herein, an “antagonist” is a substance that inhibits its binding partner, typically a receptor. Inhibition is defined in the context of the particular assay, or may be apparent in the literature from a discussion herein that makes a comparison to a factor or substance that is accepted as an “agonist” or an “antagonist” of the particular binding partner under substantially similar circumstances as appreciated by those of skill in the art. Inhibition may be defined with respect to an decrease in a particular effect or function that is induced by interaction of the antagonist with a binding partner, and can include allosteric effects.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “partial agonist” is a substance that provides a level of stimulation to its binding partner that is intermediate between that of a full or complete antagonist and an agonist defined by any accepted standard for agonist activity. It will be recognized that stimulation, and hence, inhibition is defined intrinsically for any substance or category of substances to be defined as agonists, antagonists, or partial agonists. As used herein, “intrinsic activity”, or “efficacy,” relates to some measure of biological effectiveness of the binding partner complex. With regard to receptor pharmacology, the context in which intrinsic activity or efficacy should be defined will depend on the context of the binding partner (e.g., receptor/ligand) complex and the consideration of an activity relevant to a particular biological outcome. For example, in some circumstances, intrinsic activity may vary depending on the particular second messenger system involved. See Hoyer, D. and Boddeke, H., \nTrends Pharmacol Sci. \n14(7):270-5 (1993).

Compounds resulting from the §ubstitution of 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, in any of the forgoing representative compounds, with either 1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, 1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane or 1-azabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane are also representative compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nMore specifically, the compounds of Formula 2 include compounds of the following general formulas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn each of these compounds, individual isomers thereof, mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, enantiomers, diastereomers and tautomers thereof, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nI. Methods of Preparing the Compounds\n\n\nPreparation of 2-(Arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes\n\n\nCompounds of Formulas 1 and 2 are 3-substituted 2-(arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes. While the manner in which compounds of the present invention can be prepared can vary, they are conveniently prepared using intermediates (ketones and alcohols) generated during the synthesis of 2-(arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes, which is now described. While other synthetic strategies will be apparent to those of skill in the art, 2-(arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes can be made by reduction of aldol condensation products formed from aldehydes and certain azabicyclic ketones. Thus, when 3-quinuclidinone hydrochloride is reacted with pyridine-3-carboxaldehyde (available from Aldrich Chemical Company), in the presence of methanolic potassium hydroxide, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one results. Stepwise reduction of the conjugated enone functionality can be accomplished through several different sequences, to provide 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. For instance, catalytic hydrogenation (palladium catalyst) of the enone produces the saturated ketone, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one, an intermediate in the synthesis of compounds of the present invention (see section entitled “Substituted-2-(Arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes”). Reduction of the ketone to the alcohol can be accomplished, for example, using sodium borohydride, aluminum isopropoxide, or other reagents known in the art of chemical synthesis for carrying out similar reductions. The alcohol, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol, is a mixture of cis and trans diastereomers (with the former predominating) and is also an intermediate in the synthesis of compounds of the present invention (see section entitled “Substituted-2-(Arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes”). The choice of reducing agent affects the cis/trans ratio. The alcohol can then be converted to the corresponding chloride, 3-chloro-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, using thionyl chloride or similar reagents. The chloride can then be reduced to 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, for example, using Raney nickel. The chloro intermediate can also be converted into the alkene, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene, which can then be reduced to the alkane by catalytic hydrogenation. 1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene can be used for the dehydrohalogenation reaction, according to the method of Wolkoff, \nJ. Org. Chem. \n47: 1944 (1982). Alternatively, the 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one can then be converted into 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane by first reducing the ketone functionality using sodium borohydride. The resulting unsaturated alcohol, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol, is treated with thionyl chloride (to make the chloro compound), followed by Raney nickel (to reductively remove the chloro moiety), and then hydrogenated, for example, over a palladium catalyst (to reduce the double bond) to give the alkane. It is noteworthy that, when this latter route is employed, allylic rearrangements are observed. For instance, the material resulting from Raney nickel reduction of the chloro compound is a mixture of exocyclic and endocyclic alkenes, with the latter predominating. This route provides access to both 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene.\n\n\nIn an alternative approach, 2-(arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes can be made by reacting aryl-containing organometallic compounds with azabicyclic carbonyl compounds and subsequently reducing the resulting alcohol, using the methods described above, to the alkane. For example, 2-((3-pyridinyl)hydroxymethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane can be produced by reacting 3-pyridinyllithium with quinuclidine-2-carboxaldehyde. Reaction of the alcohol with thionyl chloride to produce the corresponding chloride, and subsequent reduction with Raney nickel, will give 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Synthesis of the requisite quinuclidine-2-carboxaldehyde is described by Ricciardi and Doukas, \nHeterocycles \n24: 971 (1986), and the 3-pyridinyllithium can be generated from 3-bromopyridine by treatment with n-butyllithium in ether or toluene at low temperature (Cai et al., \nTetrahedron Lett. \n43: 4285 (2002)).\n\n\nThe manner in which 2-((4-, 5-, and 6-substituted-3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes can be synthesized can vary. For example, 5-bromopyridine-3-carboxaldehyde and 3-quinuclidinone hydrochloride (commercially available from Aldrich) can be reacted together in the presence of methanolic potassium hydroxide as described in Neilsen and Houlihan, \nOrg. React. \n16: 1 (1968). The aldol condensation product, 2-((5-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one, can then be treated with sodium borohydride to yield the alcohol, 2-((5-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol, as a crystalline solid. This intermediate is reacted with neat thionyl chloride at room temperature to give 3-chloro-2-((5-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane dihydrochloride as a pure crystalline solid. Reductive removal of the chlorine can be accomplished using lithium trimethoxyaluminum hydride and copper iodide as described by Masamune et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n95: 6452 (1973) to give the desired product, 2-((5-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, as a crystalline solid. This methylene intermediate can then be converted to the desired product, 2-(((5-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, by hydrogenation in the presence of palladium catalyst. The isomeric compounds, 2-((4-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and 2-((6-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane can be prepared in a similar manner by replacing 5-bromopyridine-3-carboxaldehyde with 4-bromopyridine-3-carboxaldehyde or 6-bromopyridine-3-carboxaldehyde, respectively, in the synthetic approach given above.\n\n\nThe required aldehyde, 5-bromopyridine-3-carboxaldehyde, can be prepared from 5-bromonicotinic acid (commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company and Lancaster Synthesis, Inc.). The 5-bromonicotinic acid can be treated with ethyl chloroformate to form a mixed anhydride, which can then be reduced, for example, with lithium aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at −78° C., to afford 5-bromo-3-(hydroxymethyl)pyridine, as reported by Ashimoii et al., \nChem. Pharm. Bull. \n38(9): 2446 (1990). Alternatively, the 5-bromonicotinic acid can be esterified, for example, in the presence of sulfuric acid and ethanol and the intermediate ethyl ester reduced with an excess of sodium borohydride to yield 5-bromo-3-(hydroxymethyl)pyridine, according to the techniques reported in Nutaitis et al., \nOrg. Prep. and Proc. Int \n24: 143 (1992). The resulting 5-bromo-3-(hydroxymethyl)pyridine can then be converted to 5-bromo-3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde by Swern oxidation using oxalyl chloride and dimethylsulfoxide, according to the methods of Stocks et al., \nTetrahedron Lett. \n36(36): 6555 (1995) and Mancuso et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n44(23): 4148 (1979). The aldehyde, 4-bromopyridine-3-carboxaldehyde can be synthesized according to methodology described in PCT WO 94/29893 by Chin et al. or by methodology described by Ojea et al., \nSynlett. \n6: 622 (1995). 6-Bromopyridine-3-carboxaldehyde can be prepared according to procedures described in Windschief and Voegtle, \nSynthesis \n1: 87 (1994) or German Patent No. 93/4320432 to Fey et al.\n\n\nThe methods described above are applicable to the preparation of a variety of 2-(arylmethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes, 2-(arylmethylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes and 2-(arylmethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-enes by variation of the aldehyde component of the aldol condensation using no more than routine experimentation. Both substituted and unsubstituted, carbocyclic and heterocyclic aromatic aldehydes can be used.\n\n\nThose skilled in the art of organic synthesis will appreciate that the reactivity of substituents borne by the aldehyde must be evaluated carefully, as some substituents may be transformed by the reaction conditions employed. Examples of groups that are potentially reactive under the reaction conditions are —OH, —SH, —NH\n2 \nand —CO\n2\nH. Suitable protecting groups or synthons for such substituents can be used, as are well known to those of skill in the art, for substituents that might otherwise be transformed during the aldol condensation or subsequent reaction steps. These “protecting” groups can be choosen, introduced and cleaved in accordance to methods described by Greene and Wuts, \nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis \n2\nnd \ned., Wiley—Interscience Pub. (1991). Examples of suitable synthons are described, for example, in Hase, \nUmpoled Synthons: A Survey of Sources and Uses in Synthesis\n, Wiley, Europe (1987). The contents of these publications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nVariation in the Length of the Linker\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention can contain more than one carbon in the linker between the heteroaromatic ring and azabicyclic ring functionalities. The manner in which such compounds as 2-(2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 2-(3-(3-pyridinyl)propyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, and 2-(4-(3-pyridinyl)butyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane can be prepared can vary. For example, 2-(2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane can be prepared by different methods. In one approach, 3-pyridineacetaldehyde (also known as 2-(3-pyridinyl)ethanal) can be condensed with 3-quinuclidinone hydrochloride (commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company) in a directed aldol reaction using a base such as potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide in methanol or sodium ethoxide in ethanol. Directed aldol condensations between an aldehyde and a ketone with accompanying reaction modifications, including procedures utilizing various enol ethers, are described in Smith and March, \nAdvanced Organic Chemistry, Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, \n5\nth \ned., Wiley-Interscience Pubs., pp. 1220-1221 (2001). Depending on reaction conditions, condensation products may or may not spontaneously dehydrate to give enones. Thus, it may be necessary to treat the intermediate condensation products, such as 2-(1-hydroxy-2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one, under any of various dehydration protocols, known to those skilled in the art, to generate, in this case, 24243-pyridinyl)ethylidene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one. The carbon-carbon double bond of this unsaturated ketone can be reduced by hydrogenation to give the ketone, 2-(2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one, which can be further reduced under Wolff-Kishner conditions to yield 2-(2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Methods similar to those described by Yanina et al., \nKhim.—Farm. Zh. \n21 (7): 808 (1987) can be used for the latter reductions. Alternatively, the ketone can be reduced to the alcohol using sodium borohydride and the alcohol subsequently reduced to the alkane by conversion to the chloro intermediate (using thionyl chloride), followed by Raney nickel reduction. Replacement of 2-(3-pyridinyl)ethanal in the above synthetic approach with 3-(3-pyridinyl)propanal leads to 2-(3-(3-pyridinyl)propyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and the corresponding synthetic intermediates. Replacement of 2-(3-pyridinyl)ethanal in the above synthetic approach with 4-(3-pyridinyl)butanal leads to 2-(4-(3-pyridinyl)butyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and the corresponding synthetic intermediates. In all cases, the saturated ketone and alcohol intermediates provide a synthetic approach to compounds of the present invention (see section entitled “Substituted 2-(Arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes”).\n\n\nThe requisite aldehydes for the above aldol condensations can be prepared by various methods. In one approach, 3-pyridineacetaldehyde (also known as 2-(3-pyridinyl)ethanal) can be prepared from 3-pyridinylacetic acid hydrochloride (commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company and Lancaster Synthesis, Inc.) through the intermediacy of the ester. Thus, treatment with trimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine generates the trimethylsilyl ester, which can then be reduced with diisobutylaluminum hydride according to the method of Chandrasekhar et al., \nTet. Lett. \n39: 909 (1998). Alternatively, 3-pyridineacetaldehyde can be prepared from 3-(3-pyridinyl)acrylic acid (commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company and Lancaster Synthesis, Inc.) using the method of Hey et al., \nJ. Chem. Soc\n. Part II: 1678 (1950). In this method, 3-(3-pyridinyl)acrylic acid can be converted to its acid chloride by treatment with thionyl chloride. Subsequent treatment of the acid chloride with ammonia, according to the method of Panizza, \nHelv. Chim. Acta \n24: 24E (1941), yields β-(3-pyridinyl)acrylamide. Hofmann rearrangement of the latter amide by treatment with sodium hypochlorite affords methyl 2-(3-pyridinyl)vinylcarbamate, which can be hydrolyzed with refluxing 3 M sulfuric acid in ethanol to give 3-pyridineacetaldehyde, which can be isolated as its 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone sulfate.\n\n\nThe aldehyde, 3-(3-pyridinyl)propanal, which can be used to prepare 2-(3-(3-pyridinyl)propyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and related compounds, can be prepared from 3-(3-pyridinyl)propanol (commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company and Lancaster Synthesis, Inc.). Oxidation of the latter alcohol, for example, with lead acetate in pyridine, according to the method of Ratcliffe et al., \nJ. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. \n1 8: 1767 (1985), affords 3-(3-pyridinyl)propanal. Alternatively, 3-(3-pyridinyl)propanal can be prepared by Swern oxidization of 3-(3-pyridinyl)propanol using oxalyl) chloride in dimethyl sulfoxide and dichloromethane according to the methods of Stocks et al., \nTet. Lett. \n36(36): 6555 (1995) and Mancuso et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n44(23): 4148 (1979).\n\n\nThe aldehyde, 4-(3-pyridinyl)butanal, required for the preparation of 2-(4-(3-pyridinyl)butyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and related compounds can be prepared from 3-(3-pyridinyl)propanol (commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company and Lancaster Synthesis, Inc.) by a homologative process according to the method of Solladie et al., \nTetrahedron: Asymmetry \n8(5): 801 (1997). Treatment of 3-(3-pyridinyl)propanol with tribromoimidazole and triphenylphosphine yields 1-bromo-3-(3-pyridinyl)propane, which can be condensed with the lithium salt of 1,3-dithiane. Hydrolysis of the dithianyl group of the resulting compound with aqueous mercuric chloride and mercuric oxide affords 4-(3-pyridinyl)butanal.\n\n\nIn yet another approach to the synthesis of 2-(2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 3-picoline can be converted into its lithio derivative, 3-(lithiomethyl)pyridine, as described by Fraser et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n50: 3232 (1985), and reacted with quinuclidine-2-carboxaldehyde. The resulting alcohol, 2-(1-hydroxy-2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, can then be converted to 2-(2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane by one of the sequences previously described (i.e., dehydration, catalytic hydrogenation; conversion to the chloride, dehydrohalogenation, catalytic hydrogenation; conversion to the chloride, Raney nickel reduction). The synthesis of quinuclidine-2-carboxaldehyde is described by Ricciardi and Doukas, \nHeterocycles \n24: 971 (1986).\n\n\nVariation in the Azabicycle\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention include those in which the azabicycle is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. The manner in which 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes can be synthesized can vary. In one approach, pyridine-3-carboxaldehyde can be reacted with 1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one in an aldol condensation. The aldol condensation product, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one, can then be converted, using reaction sequences described previously for the 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane case, into 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. A variety of unsubstituted or substituted, carbocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic aldehydesican be employed in this sequence. The requisite 1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one can be synthesized, for example, according to the methods of Wadsworth et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,217,975 and Street et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n33: 2690 (1990).\n\n\nThe present invention includes compounds in which the azabicycle is 1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane, such as 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane. An approach similar to that described for the 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane case can be used to synthesize 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane. Thus, the aldol condensation of pyridine-3-carboxaldehyde and 1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one (see Sternbach et al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n74: 2215 (1952)) will generate isomeric products, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one and 4-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one. These can then be chromatographically separated and the 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one treated as described before to produce 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane. A variety of unsubstituted or substituted, carbocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic aldehydes can be employed in this sequence. The requisite 1-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one can be synthesized, for example, according to the method of Thill and Aaron, \nJ. Org. Chem. \n33: 4376 (1969). In all cases, the saturated ketone and alcohol intermediates provide a synthetic approach to compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nSubstituted 2-(Arylalkyl)-1-azabicycloalkanes\n\n\nIt will be immediately recognized, by those skilled in the art, that the intermediates generated during the described syntheses of 2-(arylalkyl)-1-azabicycles present many opportunities for synthesizing substituted derivatives. For instance, conjugated enones, such as 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one, are known to undergo 1,4-addition reactions when exposed to organolithium and organomagnesium reagents in the presence of cuprous salts Such chemistry is reviewed by Posner, \nOrg. React. \n19: 1 (1972) and House, \nAcc. Chem. Res. \n9: 59 (1976). In some cases conjugate 1,4-addition is observed even in the absence of cuprous salts. Thus, treatment of 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one with phenylmagnesium bromide in ether at −10° C. gives 2-(1-phenyl-1-(3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-3-one as the predominant product. This ketone can then be treated with sodium borohydride to yield the alcohol, 2-(1-phenyl-1-(3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol. This alcohol can then be reacted with neat thionyl chloride at room temperature to give 3-chloro-2-(1-phenyl-1-(3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane as a crystalline solid. The chlorine can be removed by hydrogenation in the presence of Raney nickel, as described by de Koning, \nOrg. Prep. Proced. Int. \n7: 31 (1975), to give 2-(1-phenyl-1-(3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Using variations on this approach, a number of alkyl and aryl substituents can be installed on the linker moiety between the heteroaromatic (e.g., pyridine) and azabicyclic (e.g., quinuclidine) rings.\n\n\nThe saturated ketone intermediates, such as 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one, also present opportunities for derivatization. One example is the reaction with phosphorus ylids (Wittig and Horner-Emmons reagents) to give alkenes. These alkenes can subsequently be reduced to alkanes by catalytic hydrogenation, providing a means of producing 2-((heteroaryl)alkyl)-1-azabicycles with alkyl and substituted alkyl substituents at the 3-position of the azabicycle. Thus, by way of example, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one reacts with methylenetriphenylphosphorane to give 3-methylene-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Hydrogenation of this alkene, for example, over palladium on carbon catalyst, yields 3-methyl-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane as predominantly the cis diastereomer.\n\n\nAnother illustration of derivatization of saturated ketone intermediates is the reductive amination to give amines. Thus, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one reacts with ammonium formate, zinc chloride and sodium cyanoborohydride to give 3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane as predominantly the cis diastereomer. Likewise, reaction of 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one with methylamine and sodium cyanoborohydride provides 3-(methylamino)-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. These amine derivatives can be used as a template for library formation by reacting them with a variety of acylating agents (e.g., acid chlorides, acid anhydrides, active esters, and carboxylic acids in the presence of coupling reagents) and isocyanates to produce 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes with amide and urea substituents in the 3-position of the 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, both of which classes are compounds of the present invention. Commercially unavailable isocyanates can be prepared in situ from corresponding amines and tiphosgene in the presence of triethylamine. Such derivtatives can be produced as single enantiomers, using the single enantiomers of 3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and 3-(methylamino)-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane as starting materials. For instance, the (2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)-3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes can be produced by resolution of the cis 3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, for example, using diastereomeric amides. Thus, when the cis amine is reacted with a chiral acid such as (S)—N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)proline using a suitable coupling agent such as diphenylchlorophosphate, a pair of diastereomeric amides, separable by reverse phase chromatography, is produced. The separated proline amides can then be deprotected, for example, by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid (to remove the tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group) and then the proline can be cleaved from the desired amine, for example, using Edman degradation conditions (i.e., phenylisothiocyanate, followed by trifluoroacetic acid).\n\n\nAlternatively, racemic reductive amination products such as 3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane can be separated into their enantiomers by fractional crystallization of the di-O-p-toluoyltartaric acid salts. Both the D (S,S) and L (R,R) isomers of this acid are commercially available (Aldrich Chemical Company). Thus, combination of the racemic cis 3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane with 0.5 molar equivalents of either enantiomer of di-O-p-toluoyltartaric acid yields a diastereomeric salt mixture, from which a single diastereomer precipitates from methanol solution.\n\n\nThe saturated alcohol intermediates, such as 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol, can also serve as templates for compound libraries. For instance, ethers can be generated from these alcohols, for example, using either Mitsunobu or Williamson conditions. Thus, by way of example, when 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol is reacted with phenol via Mitsunobu coupling with diethylazidocarboxylate and triphenylphosphine (Guthrie et al., \nJ. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans \n145: 2328 (1981)), 3-phenoxy-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane results. Similarly, when 2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol is treated with sodium hydride and methyl iodide, the unsaturated ether, 3-methoxy-2-((3-pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, is formed. This gives the saturated ether, 3-methoxy-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (predominantly cis), upon catalytic hydrogenation.\n\n\nThe saturated alcohol intermediates can also be reacted with acylating agents (e.g.; acid chlorides and anhydrides) and isocyanates to produce esters and carbamates, respectively. Thus, by way of example, 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol reacts with phenylisocyanate to yield 3-(N-phenylcarbamoyloxy)-2((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Such carbamate compounds are compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nSuch derivatives can be produced as single enantiomers, using the single enantiomers of 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol as starting materials. For instance, the (2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ols can be produced by resolution of the cis 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol, using diastereomeric esters. Thus, when the cis alcohol is reacted with (S)-2-methoxy-2-phenylacetic acid and N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, a pair of diastereomeric esters, separable by reverse phase chromatography, is produced. The separated esters can then be hydrolyzed to the enantiomerically pure alcohols, for example, using potassium hydroxide in methanol. Alternatively (1 S)-(−)-camphanic acid chloride can be used to produce diastereomeric camphanate esters of cis 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol. The esters are then fractionally crystallized, using the procedure described by Swaim, et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n38: 4793 (1995).\n\n\nA number of compounds possessing substituents at the 5-position of the pyridine ring can be prepared from 2-((5-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, the synthesis of which has already been described. For example, the 5-amino-substituted compound can be prepared from the corresponding 5-bromo compound, using ammonia in the presence of a copper catalyst according to the general method of Zwart et al., \nRecueil Tray. Chim. Pays\n-\nBas \n74: 1062 (1955). 5-Alkylamino-substituted compounds can be prepared in a similar manner. 5-Alkoxy-substituted analogs can be prepared from the corresponding 5-bromo compounds by heating with a sodium alkoxide in N,N-dimethylformamide or by use of a copper catalyst according to the general techniques described by Comins et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n55: 69 (1990) and den Hertog et al., \nRecueil Tray. Chim. Pays\n-\nBas \n74: 1171 (1955). 5-Ethynyl-substituted compounds can be prepared from the appropriate 5-bromo compounds by palladium-catalyzed coupling using 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol, followed by base (sodium hydride) catalyzed deprotection, according to the general techniques described by Cosford et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n39: 3235 (1996). The 5-ethynyl analogs can be converted into the corresponding 5-ethenyl, and subsequently to the corresponding 5-ethyl analogs by successive catalytic hydrogenation reactions. The 5-phenyl analogs can be prepared from the 5-bromo compounds by Suzuki coupling with phenylboronic acid. Substituted phenylboronic acids can also be used. The 5-azido-substituted analogs can be prepared from the corresponding 5-bromo compounds by reaction with sodium azide in N,N-dimethylformamide. 5-Alkylthio-substituted analogs can be prepared from the corresponding 5-bromo compound by reaction with an appropriate alkylmercaptan in the presence of sodium, using techniques known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis.\n\n\nA number of 5-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds can be synthesized from the corresponding 5-amino compounds via the 5-diazonium salt intermediates. Among the other 5-substituted analogs that can be produced from 5-diazonium salt intermediates are: 5-hydroxy analogs, 5-fluoro analogs, 5-chloro analogs, 5-bromo analogs, 5-iodo analogs, 5-cyano analogs, and 5-mercapto analogs. These compounds can be synthesized using the general techniques set forth in Zwart et al., \nRecueil Tray. Chim. Pays\n-\nBas \n74: 1062 (1955). For example, 5-hydroxy-substituted analogs can be prepared from the reaction of the corresponding 5-diazonium salt intermediates with water. 5-Fluoro-substituted analogs can be prepared from the reaction of the 5-diazonium salt intermediates with fluoroboric acid. 5-Chloro-substituted analogs can be prepared from the reaction of the 5-amino compounds with sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid in the presence of copper chloride. 5-Cyano-substituted analogs can be prepared from the reaction of the corresponding 5-diazonium salt intermediates with potassium copper cyanide. 5-Amino-substituted analogs can also be converted to the corresponding 5-nitro analogs by reaction with fuming sulfuric acid and peroxide, according to the general techniques described in Morisawa, \nJ. Med. Chem. \n20: 129 (1977) for converting an aminopyridine to a nitropyridine. Appropriate 5-diazonium salt intermediates can also be used for the synthesis of mercapto-substituted analogs using the general techniques described in Hoffman et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n36: 953 (1993). The 5-mercapto-substituted analogs can in turn be converted to the 5-alkylthio-substituted analogs by reaction with sodium hydride and an appropriate alkyl bromide. 5-Acylamido analogs of the aforementioned compounds can be prepared by reaction of the corresponding 5-amino compounds with an appropriate acid anhydride or acid chloride, using techniques known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis.\n\n\n5-Hydroxy-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds can be used to prepare corresponding 5-alkanoyloxy-substituted compounds by reaction with the appropriate acid, acid chloride, or acid anhydride. Likewise, the 5-hydroxy compounds are precursors of both the 5-aryloxy and 5-heteroaryloxy analogs via nucleophilic aromatic substitution at electron deficient aromatic rings (e.g., 4-fluorobenzonitrile and 2,4-dichloropyrimidine). Such chemistry is well known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Ether derivatives can also be prepared from the 5-hydroxy compounds by alkylation with alkyl halides and a suitable base or via Mitsunobu chemistry, in which a trialkyl- or triarylphosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate are typically used. See Hughes, \nOrg. React\n. (N.Y.) 42: 335 (1992) and Hughes, \nOrg. Prep. Proced. Int. \n28: 127 (1996) for typical Mitsunobu conditions.\n\n\n5-Cyano-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds can be hydrolyzed to afford the corresponding 5-carboxamido-substituted compounds.\n\n\nFurther hydrolysis results in formation of the corresponding 5-carboxylic acid-substituted analogs. Reduction of the 5-cyano-substituted analogs with lithium aluminum hydride yields the corresponding 5-aminomethyl analogs. 5-Acyl-substituted analogs can be prepared from corresponding 5-carboxylic acid-substituted analogs by reaction with an appropriate alkyllithium reagent using techniques known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis.\n\n\n5-Carboxylic acid-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds can be converted to the corresponding esters by reaction with an appropriate alcohol and acid catalyst. Compounds with an ester group at the 5-pyridinyl position can be reduced, for example, with sodium borohydride or lithium aluminum hydride to produce the corresponding 5-hydroxymethyl-substituted analogs. These analogs in turn can be converted to compounds bearing an alkoxymethyl moiety at the 5-pyridinyl position by reaction, for example, with sodium hydride and an appropriate alkyl halide, using conventional techniques. Alternatively, the 5-hydroxymethyl-substituted analogs can be reacted with tosyl chloride to provide the corresponding 5-tosyloxymethyl analogs. The 5-carboxylic acid-substituted analogs can also be converted to the corresponding 5-alkylaminoacyl analogs by sequential treatment with thionyl chloride and an appropriate alkylamine. Certain of these amides are known to readily undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution to produce ketones. Thus, the so-called Weinreb amides (N-methoxy-N-methylamides) react with aryllithium reagents to produce the corresponding diaryl ketones. For example, see Selnick et al., \nTet. Lett. \n34: 2043 (1993).\n\n\n5-Tosyloxymethyl-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds can be converted to the corresponding 5-methyl-substituted compounds by reduction with lithium aluminum hydride. 5-Tosyloxymethyl-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds can also be used to produce 5-alkyl-substituted compounds via reaction with an alkyl lithium salt. 5-Hydroxy-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds can be used to prepare 5-N-alkylcarbamoyloxy-substituted compounds by reaction with N-alkylisocyanates. 5-Amino-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds can be used to prepare 5-N-alkoxycarboxamido-substituted compounds by reaction with alkyl chloroformate esters, using techniques known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis.\n\n\nAnalogous chemistries to those described hereinbefore, for the preparation of the 5-substituted analogs of compounds of the present invention, can be employed for the synthesis of 2-, 4-, and 6-substituted analogs. Starting materials for these transformations include the aforementioned 2-((4- and 6-bromo-3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes, as well as the 2((2-, 4-, and 6-amino-3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes, which are accessible from 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane via the Chichibabin reaction (Lahti et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n42: 2227 (1999).\n\n\nThe compounds can be isolated and purified using methods well known to those of skill in the art, including, for example, crystallization, chromatography and/or extraction.\n\n\nThe compounds of Formulas 1 and 2 can be obtained in optically pure form by separating their racemates in accordance with the customary methods or by using optically pure starting materials.\n\n\nThe compounds of Formulas 1 and 2 can optionally be converted into addition salts with a mineral or organic acid by the action of such an acid in an appropriate solvent, for example, an organic solvent such as an alcohol; a ketone, an ether or a chlorinated solvent. These salts likewise form part of the invention.\n\n\nRepresentative pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, benzenesulphonate, bromide, chloride, citrate, ethanesulphonate, fumarate, gluconate, iodate, maleate, isethionate, methanesulphonate, methylenebis(β-oxynaphthoate), nitrate, oxalate, palmoate, phosphate, salicylate, succinate, sulphate, tartrate, theophyllinacetate, p-toluenesulphonate, hemigalactarate and galactarate salts.\n\n\nImaging Agents\n\n\nCertain compounds of the present invention (e.g., the amide derivatives of 3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) can be synthesized in such a manner as to incorporate a radionuclide useful in diagnostic imaging. Of particular interest are those compounds that include radioactive isotopic moieties such as \n11\nC, \n18\nF, \n76\nBr, \n123\nI, \n125\nI, and the like. The compounds can be radiolabeled at any of a variety of positions. For example, a radionuclide of the halogen series may be used within an alkyl halide or aryl halide moiety or functionality; while a radionuclide such as \n11\nC may be used with an alkyl (e.g., methyl) moiety or functionality.\n\n\nFor instance, commercially available p-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid (Aldrich) is converted, by treatment with iodomethane in methanol, into p-(trimethylammonium)benzoate, as described by Willstaetter and Kahn, \nChem. Ber. \n37: 406 (1904). The displacement of the trimethylammonium group by fluoride has been reported, in similar compounds, by several researchers (see, for instance, Mach et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n36: 3707 (1993) and Jalalian et al., \nJ Labelled Compd. Radiopharm. \n43: 545 (2000)). These nucleophilic aromatic) substitution reactions are typically carried out in dimethylsulfoxide (with or without water cosolvent), using KF or CsF as the source of fluoride ion (when KF is used, often Kryptofix® 222 is added). When \n18\nF\n−\n is used in such a displacement, p-\n18\nfluorobenzoic acid results. This carboxylic acid can be rapidly coupled to 3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), using any of a variety of techniques known to those skilled in the art (some of which are described previously), to generate N-(2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)-4-\n18\nfluorobenzamide, which can be used to specifically image α7 nAChRs.\n\n\nThose compounds that include an amide or urea functionality (i.e., X and/or Z=NR′, R′═H) can be readily radiolabeled by alkylating the amide or urea group with a radiolabeled haloalkane in the presence of a base (i.e., to form substituted compounds where R′ is a radiolabeled lower alkyl, cycloalkyl or arylalkyl moiety). One example of such a radiolabeled haloalkane is \n11\nC-labeled methyl iodide. Methods similar to those described by A. G. Horti et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n41: 4199-4206 (1998) can be used. The resulting N—[\n11\nC]methyl-containing compounds can be purified by semi-preparative or preparative HPLC and briefly isolated for reconstitution. The \n11\nC-labeled methyl iodide can be prepared according to the general method described by B. L{dot over (a)}ngström et al. \nJ. Nucl. Med. \n28(6):1037-1040 (1987). Thus, nitrogen gas is irradiated with 10 MeV protons producing \n11\nC-carbon dioxide. The \n11\nC-carbon dioxide is trapped using 4 Å molecular sieves, which are subsequently stored in a lead shield. The \n11\nC-carbon dioxide is liberated from the 4 Å molecular sieves by heating to ˜250° C. The \n11\nC-carbon dioxide is then carried in a stream of nitrogen and trapped in a vessel containing lithium aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran. The tetrahydrofuran is removed by heating and a nitrogen flow, and the lithium aluminum hydride complex is then hydrolyzed by treatment with hydriodic acid, affording \n11\nC-labeled methyl iodide. The \n11\nC-labeled methyl iodide can be transferred by carrier gas to the reaction vessel containing the material to be methylated. The required amide- and urea-containing precursor compounds are described in detail above, and the resulting radiolabeled compounds can also be used to specifically image α7 nAChRs.\n\n\nII. Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nThe compounds described herein can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions and used to prevent a condition or disorder in a subject susceptible to such a condition or disorder, and/or to treat a subject suffering from the condition or disorder. The pharmaceutical compositions described herein include one or more compounds of Formulas 1 and 2 and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Chiral compounds can be employed as racemic mixtures or as pure enantiomers.\n\n\nThe manner in which the compounds are administered can vary. The compositions are preferably administered orally (e.g., in liquid form within a solvent such as an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or within a solid carrier). Preferred compositions for oral administration include pills, tablets, capsules, caplets, syrups, and solutions, including hard gelatin capsules and time-release capsules. Compositions can be formulated in unit dose form, or in multiple or subunit doses. Preferred compositions are in liquid or semisolid form. Compositions including a liquid pharmaceutically inert carrier such as water or other pharmaceutically compatible liquids or semisolids can be used. The use of such liquids and semisolids is well known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\nThe compositions can also be administered via injection, i.e., intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intraarterially, intrathecally; and intracerebroventricularly. Intravenous administration is the preferred method of injection. Suitable carriers for injection are well known to those of skill in the art and include 5% dextrose solutions, Saline, and phosphate-buffered saline. The compounds can also be administered as an infusion or injection (e.g., as a suspension or as an emulsion in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or mixture of liquids).\n\n\nThe formulations can also be administered using other means, for example, rectal administration. Formulations useful for rectal administration, such as suppositories, are well known to those of skill in the art. The compounds can also be administered by inhalation (e.g., in the form of an aerosol either nasally or using delivery articles of the type set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,922,901 to Brooks et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety); topically (e.g., in lotion form); or transdermally (e.g., using a transdermal patch, using technology that is commercially available from Novartis and Alza Corporation). Although it is possible to administer the compounds in the form of a bulk active chemical, it is preferred to present each compound in the form of a pharmaceutical composition or formulation for efficient and effective administration.\n\n\nExemplary methods for administering such compounds will be apparent to the skilled artisan. The usefulness of these formulations can depend on the particular composition used and the particular subject receiving the treatment. These formulations can contain a liquid carrier that can be oily, aqueous, emulsified or contain certain solvents suitable to the mode of administration.\n\n\nThe compositions can be administered intermittently or at a gradual, continuous, constant or controlled rate to a warm-blooded animal (e.g., a mammal such as a mouse, rat, cat, rabbit, dog, pig, cow, or monkey), but advantageously are administered to a human being. In addition, the time of day and the number of times per day that the pharmaceutical formulation is administered can vary.\n\n\nPreferably, upon administration, the active ingredients interact with receptor sites within the body of the subject that affect the functioning of the CNS. More specifically, in treating a CNS disorder, preferable administration is designed to optimize the effect upon those relevant nicotinic acethylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes that have an effect upon the functioning of the CNS, while minimizing the effects upon muscle-type receptor subtypes. Other suitable methods for administering the compounds of the present invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,604,231 to Smith et al., the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nIn certain circumstances, the compounds described herein can be employed as part of a pharmaceutical composition with other compounds intended to prevent or treat a particular disorder. In addition to effective amounts of the compounds described herein, the pharmaceutical compositions can also include various other components as additives or adjuncts. Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable components or adjuncts which are employed in relevant circumstances include antioxidants, free-radical scavenging agents, peptides, growth factors, antibiotics, bacteriostatic agents, immunosuppressives, anticoagulants, buffering agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-pyretics, time-release binders, anesthetics, steroids, vitamins, minerals and corticosteroids. Such components can provide additional therapeutic benefit, act to affect the therapeutic action of the pharmaceutical composition, or act towards preventing any potential side effects that can be imposed as a result of administration of the pharmaceutical composition.\n\n\nThe appropriate dose of the compound is that amount effective to prevent occurrence of the symptoms of the disorder or to treat some symptoms of the disorder from which the patient suffers. By “effective amount”, “therapeutic amount” or “effective dose” is meant that amount sufficient to elicit the desired pharmacological or therapeutic effects, thus resulting in effective prevention or treatment of the disorder.\n\n\nWhen treating a CNS disorder, an effective amount of compound is an amount sufficient to pass across the blood-brain barrier of the subject, to bind to relevant receptor sites in the brain of the subject and to modulate the activity of relevant nAChR subtypes (e.g., provide neurotransmitter secretion, thus resulting in effective prevention or treatment of the disorder). Prevention of the disorder is manifested by delaying the onset of the symptoms of the disorder. Treatment of the disorder is manifested by a decrease in the symptoms associated with the disorder or an amelioration of the recurrence of the symptoms of the disorder. Preferably, the effective amount is sufficient to obtain the desired result, but insufficient to cause appreciable side effects.\n\n\nThe effective dose can vary, depending upon factors such as the condition of the patient, the severity of the symptoms of the disorder, and the manner in which the pharmaceutical composition is administered. For human patients, the effective dose of typical compounds generally requires administering the compound in an amount sufficient to modulate the activity of relevant nAChRs to effect neurotransmitter (e.g., dopamine) release, but the amount should be insufficient to induce effects on skeletal muscles and ganglia to any significant degree. The effective dose of compounds will of course differ from patient to patient, but in general includes amounts starting where CNS effects or other desired therapeutic effects occur but below the amount where muscular effects are observed.\n\n\nThe compounds, when employed in effective amounts in accordance with the method described herein, are selective to certain relevant nAChRs, but do not significantly activate receptors associated with undesirable side effects at concentrations at least greater than those required for eliciting the release of dopamine or other neurotransmitters. By this is meant that a particular dose of compound effective in preventing and/or treating a CNS disorder is essentially ineffective in eliciting activation of certain ganglionic-type nAChRs at concentration higher than 5 times, preferably higher than 100 times, and more preferably higher than 1,000 times than those required for modulation of neurotransmitter release. This selectivity of certain compounds described herein against those ganglionic-type receptors responsible for cardiovascular side effects is demonstrated by a lack of the ability of those compounds to activate nicotinic function of adrenal chromaffin tissue at concentrations greater than those required for activation of dopamine release.\n\n\nThe compounds described herein, when employed in effective amounts in accordance with the methods described herein, can provide some degree of prevention of the progression of CNS disorders, ameliorate symptoms of CNS disorders, and ameliorate to some degree of the recurrence of CNS disorders. The effective amounts of those compounds are typically below the threshold concentration required to elicit any appreciable side effects, for example those effects relating to skeletal muscle. The compounds can be administered in a therapeutic window in which certain CNS disorders are treated and certain side effects are avoided. Ideally, the effective dose of the compounds described herein is sufficient to provide the desired effects upon the CNS but is insufficient (i.e., is not at a high enough level) to provide undesirable side effects. Preferably, the compounds are administered at a dosage effective for treating the CNS disorders but less than ⅕, and often less than 1/10, the amount required to elicit certain side effects to any significant degree.\n\n\nMost preferably, effective doses are at very low concentrations, where maximal effects are observed to occur, with a minimum of side effects. Typically, the effective dose of such compounds generally requires administering the compound in an amount of less than 5 mg/kg of patient weight. Often, the compounds of the present invention are administered in an amount from less than about 1 mg/kg patent weight and usually less than about 100 μg/kg of patient weight, but frequently between about 10 μg to less than 100 μg/kg of patient weight. For compounds that do not induce effects on muscle-type nicotinic receptors at low concentrations, the effective dose is less than 5 mg/kg of patient weight; and often such compounds are administered in an amount from 150 μg to less than 5 mg/kg of patient weight. The foregoing effective doses typically represent that amount administered as a single dose, or as one or more doses administered over a 24-hour period.\n\n\nFor human patients, the effective dose of typical compounds generally requires administering the compound in an amount of at least about 1, often at least about 10, and frequently at least about 100 mg/24 hr/patient. For human patients, the effective dose of typical compounds requires administering the compound which generally does not exceed about 500, often does not exceed about 400, and frequently does not exceed about 300 mg/24 hr/patient. In addition, the compositions are advantageously administered at an effective dose such that the concentration of the compound within the plasma of the patient normally does not exceed 50 ng/mL, often does not exceed 30 ng/mL, and frequently does not exceed 10 ng/mL.\n\n\nIII. Methods of Using the Compounds and/or Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nThe compounds can be used to treat those types of conditions and disorders for which other types of nicotinic compounds have been proposed as therapeutics. See, for example, Williams et al., \nDrug News Perspec. \n7(4):205 (1994), Americ et al., \nCNS Drug Rev. \n1(1):1 (1995), Americ et al., \nExp. Opin. Invest.

No. 5,597,919 to Dull et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,604,231 to Smith et al., the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nMore particularly, the compounds can be used to treat those types of conditions and disorders for which nicotinic compounds with selectivity for the α7 nAChR subtype have been proposed as therapeutics. See, for example, Leonard et al., \nSchizophrenia Bulletin \n22(3): 431 (1996), Freedman et al., \nBiological Psychiatry \n38(1):22 (1995), Heeschen et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n100: 527 (2002), Utsugisawa et al., \nMolecular Brain Research \n106(1-2): 88 (2002), U.S. Patent Application 2002/0016371, Levin and Rezvani, \nCurrent Drug Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders \n1(4): 423 (2002)), O'Neill et al., \nCurrent Drug Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders \n1(4): 399 (2002, Jeyarasasingam et al., \nNeuroscience \n109(2): 275 (2002)), Xiao et al., \nProc.

Labelled Comp. Radiopharm. \n44: 785 (2001) and Macor et al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. \n11: 319 (2001) and references therein, the contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nThe compounds can also be used as adjunct therapy in combination with existing therapies in the management of the aforementioned types of diseases and disorders. In such situations, it is preferably to administer the active ingredients in a manner that minimizes effects upon nAChR subtypes such as those that are associated with muscle and ganglia. This can be accomplished by targeted drug delivery and/or by adjusting the dosage such that a desired effect is obtained without meeting the threshold dosage required to achieve significant side effects. The pharmaceutical compositions can be used to ameliorate any of the symptoms associated with those conditions, diseases and disorders. Representative classes of disorders that can be treated are discussed in detail below.\n\n\nTreatment of CNS Disorders\n\n\nExamples of conditions and disorders that can be treated include neurological disorders and neurodegenerative disorders, and, in particular, CNS disorders. CNS disorders can be drug induced; can be attributed to genetic predisposition, infection or trauma; or can be of unknown etiology. CNS disorders comprise neuropsychiatric disorders, neurological diseases and mental illnesses, and include neurodegenerative diseases, behavioral disorders, cognitive disorders and cognitive affective disorders. There are several CNS disorders whose clinical manifestations have been attributed to CNS dysfunction (i.e., disorders resulting from inappropriate levels of neurotransmitter release, inappropriate properties of neurotransmitter receptors, and/or inappropriate interaction between neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter receptors). Several CNS disorders can be attributed to a deficiency of choline, dopamine, norepinephrine and/or serotonin.\n\n\nExamples of CNS disorders that can be treated in accordance with the present invention include pre-senile dementia (early onset Alzheimer's disease), senile dementia (dementia of the Alzheimer's type), Lewy Body dementia, micro-infarct dementia, AIDS-related dementia, HIV-dementia, multiple cerebral infarcts, Parkinsonism including Parkinson's disease, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington's chorea, tardive dyskinesia, hyperkinesia, mania, attention deficit disorder, anxiety, depression, dyslexia, schizophrenia depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, Tourette's syndrome, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), age-associated memory impairment (AAMI), premature amnesic and cognitive disorders which are age-related or a consequence of alcoholism, or immunodeficiency syndrome, or are associated with vascular disorders, with genetic alterations (such as, for example, trisomy 21) or with attention deficiencies or learning deficiencies, acute or chronic neurodegenerative conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neurotrophies, and cerebral or spinal traumas. In addition, the compounds can be used to treat nicotine addiction and/or other behavioral disorders related to substances that lead to dependency (e.g., alcohol, cocaine, heroin and opiates, psychostimulants, benzodiazepines and barbiturates).\n\n\nSchizophrenia is an example of a CNS disorder that is particularly amenable to treatment by modulating the α7 nAChR subtype. The compounds can also be administered to improve cognition and/or provide neuroprotection, and these uses are also particularly amenable to treatment with compounds, such as the compounds of the present invention, that are specific for the α7 nAChR subtype.\n\n\nThe disorders can be treated and/or prevented by administering to a patient in need of treatment or prevention thereof an effective treatment or preventative amount of a compound that provides some degree of prevention of the progression of a CNS disorder (i.e., provides protective effects), ameliorating the symptoms of the disorder, and ameliorating the recurrence of the disorder.\n\n\nAnti-Inflammatory Uses\n\n\nExcessive inflammation and tumor necrosis factor synthesis cause morbidity and even mortality in a variety of diseases. These diseases include, but are not limited to, endotoxemia, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, and irritable bowel disease. The nervous system, primarily through the vagus nerve, is known to regulate the magnitude of the innate immune response by inhibiting the release of macrophage tumor necrosis factor (TNF). This physiological mechanism is known as the “cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway” (see, for exampled Tracey, “The inflammatory reflex,” \nNature. \n420:853-9(2002)).\n\n\nThe nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7 subunit is required for acetylcholine inhibition of macrophage TNF release, and also inhibits release of other cytokines. Agonists (or, at elevated dosages, partial agonists) at the α7 specific receptor subtype can inhibit the TNF-modulated inflammatory response. Accordingly, those compounds described herein that are α7 agonists can be used to treat inflammatory disorders characterized by excessive synthesis of TNF (See also Wang et al., “Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7 subunit is an essential regulator of inflammation”, \nNature, \n421:384-8(2003)).\n\n\nInflammatory conditions that can be treated or prevented by administering the compounds described herein include, but are not limited to, chronic and acute inflammation, psoriasis, gout, acute pseudogout, acute gouty arthritis, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, allograft rejection, chronic transplant rejection, asthma, atherosclerosis, mononuclear-phagocyte dependent lung injury, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, atopic dermatitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adult respiratory distress syndrome, acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, acute cholangitis, aphteous stomatitis, glomerulondphritis, lupus nephritis, thrombosis, and graft vs. host reaction.\n\n\nMinimizing the Inflammatory Response Associated with Bacterial and/or Viral Infection\n\n\nMany bacterial and/or viral infections are associated with side effects brought on by the formation of toxins, and the body's natural response to the bacteria or virus and/or the toxins. Examples of such bacterial infections include anthrax, botulism, and sepsis. As discussed above, the body's response to infection often involves generating a significant amount of TNF and/or other cytokines. The over-expression of these cytokines can result in significant injury, such as septic shock (when the bacteria is sepsis), endotoxic shock, urosepsis and toxic shock syndrome.\n\n\nCytokine expression is mediated by the α7 nAChR, and can be inhibited by administering agonists or partial agonists of these receptors. Those compounds described herein that are agonists or partial agonists of these receptors can therefore be used to minimize the inflammatory response associated with bacterial infection, as well as viral and fungal infections. Certain of the compounds themselves may also have antimicrobial properties.\n\n\nThese compounds can also be used as adjunct therapy in combination with existing therapies to manage bacterial, viral and fungal infections, such as antibiotics, antivirals and antifungals. Antitoxins can also be used to bind to toxins produced by the infectious agents and allow the bound toxins to pass through the body without generating an inflammatory response. Examples of antitoxins are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,310,043 to Bundle et al., incorporated herein by reference. Other agents effective against bacterial and other toxins can be effective and their therapeutic effect can be complimented by co-administration with the compounds described herein.\n\n\nAnalgesic Uses\n\n\nThe compounds can be administered to treat and/or prevent pain, including neurologic, neuropathic and chronic pain. The analgesic activity of compounds described herein can be demonstrated in models of persistent inflammatory pain and of neuropathic pain, performed as described in U.S. Published Patent Application No. 20010056084 A1 (Allgeier et al.) (e.g., mechanical hyperalgesia in the complete Freund's adjuvant rat model of inflammatory pain and mechanical hyperalgesia in the mouse partial sciatic nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain).\n\n\nThe analgesic effect is suitable for treating pain of various genesis or etiology, in particular in treating inflammatory pain and associated hyperalgesia, neuropathic pain and associated hyperalgesia, chronic pain (e.g., severe chronic pain, post-operative pain and pain associated with various conditions including cancer, angina, renal or billiary colic, menstruation, migraine and gout). Inflammatory pain may be of diverse genesis, including arthritis and rheumatoid disease, teno-synovitis and vasculitis. Neuropathic pain includes trigeminal or herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy pain, causalgia, low hack pain and deafferentation syndromes such as brachial plexus avulsion.\n\n\nInhibition of Neovascularization\n\n\nThe α7 nAChR is also associated with neovascularization. Inhibition of neovascularization, for example, by administering antagonists (or at certain dosages, partial agonists) of the α7 nAChR can treat or prevent conditions characterized by undesirable neovascularization or angiogenesis. Such conditions can include those characterized by inflammatory angiogenesis and/or ischemia-induced angiogenesis. Neovascularization associated with tumor growth can also be inhibited by administering those compounds described herein that function as antagonists or partial agonists of α7 nAChR.\n\n\nSpecific antagonism of α7 nAChR-specific activity reduces the angiogenic response to inflammation, ischemia, and neoplasia. Guidance regarding appropriate animal model systems for evaluating the compounds described herein can be found, for example, in Heeschen, C. et al., “A novel angiogenic pathway mediated by non-neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,” \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n110(4):527-36 (2002), incorporated herein by reference regarding disclosure of α7-specific inhibition of angiogenesis and cellular (in vitro) and animal modeling of angiogenic activity relevant to human disease, especially the Lewis lung tumor model (in vivo, in mice—see, in particular, pages 529, and 532-533).\n\n\nRepresentative tumor types that can be treated using the compounds described herein include NSCLC, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast carcinoma, colon carcinoma, rectum carcinoma, lung carcinoma, oropharynx carcinoma, hypopharynx carcinoma, esophagus carcinoma, stomach carcinoma, pancreas carcinoma, liver carcinoma, gallbladder carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma, small intestine carcinoma, urinary tract carcinoma, kidney carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, urothelium carcinoma, female genital tract carcinoma, cervix carcinoma, uterus carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, gestational trophoblastic disease, male genital tract carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, seminal vesicles carcinoma, testes carcinoma, germ cell tumors, endocrine gland carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, adrenal carcinoma, pituitary gland carcinoma, skin carcinoma, hemangiomas, melanomas, sarcomas, bone and soft tissue sarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, tumors of the brain, tumors of the nerves, tumors of the eyes, tumors of the meninges, astrocytomas, gliomas, glioblastomas, retinoblastomas, neuromas, neuroblastomas, Schwannomas, meningiomas, solid tumors arising from hematopoietic malignancies (such as leukemias, chloromas, plasmacytomas and the plaques and tumors of mycosis fungoides and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/leukemia), and solid tumors arising from lymphomas.\n\n\nThe compounds can also be administered in conjunction with other forms of anti-cancer treatment, including co-administration with antineoplastic antitumor agents such as cis-platin, adriamycin, daunomycin, and the like, and/or anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agents, as such are known in the art.\n\n\nThe compounds can be administered in such a manner that they are targeted to the tumor site. For example, the compounds can be administered in microspheres, microparticles or liposomes conjugated to various antibodies that direct the microparticles to the tumor. Additionally, the compounds can be present in microspheres, microparticles or liposomes that are appropriately sized to pass through the arteries and veins, but lodge in capillary beds surrounding tumors and administer the compounds locally to the tumor. Such drug delivery devices are known in the art.\n\n\nOther Disorders\n\n\nIn addition to treating CNS disorders, inflammatory disorders, and neovascular disorders, and inhibiting the pain response, the compounds can be also used to prevent or treat certain other conditions, diseases, and disorders. Examples include autoimmune disorders such as Lupus, disorders associated with cytokine release, cachexia secondary to infection (e.g., as occurs in AIDS, AIDS related complex and neoplasia), as well as those indications set forth in PCT WO 98/25619. The compounds can also be administered to treat convulsions such as those that are symptomatic of epilepsy, and to treat conditions such as syphillis and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease.\n\n\nDiagnostic Uses\n\n\nThe compounds can be used in diagnostic compositions, such as probes, particularly when they are modified to include appropriate labels. The probes can be used, for example, to determine the relative number and/or function of specific receptors, particularly the α7 receptor subtype. The compounds of the present invention most preferably are labeled with a radioactive isotopic moiety such as \n11\nC, \n18\nF, \n76\nBr, \n123\nI or \n125\nI, as discussed above.\n\n\nThe administered compounds can be detected using known detection methods appropriate for the label used. Examples of detection methods include position emission topography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The radiolabels described above are useful in PET (e.g., \n11\nC, \n18\nF or \n76\nBr) and SPECT (e.g., \n123\nI) imaging, with half-lives of about 20.4 minutes for \n11\nC, about 109 minutes for \n18\nF, about 13 hours for \n123\nI, and about 16 hours for \n76\nBr. A high specific activity is desired to visualize the selected receptor subtypes at non-saturating concentrations. The administered doses typically are below) the toxic range and provide high contrast images. The compounds are expected to be capable of administration in non-toxic levels. Determination of dose is carried out in a manner known to one skilled in the art of radiolabel imaging. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,969,144 to London et al.\n\n\nThe compounds can be administered using known techniques. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,969,144 to London et al. The compounds can be administered in formulation compositions that incorporate other ingredients, such as those types of ingredients that are useful in formulating a diagnostic composition. Compounds useful in accordance with carrying out the present invention most preferably are employed in forms of high purity. See, U.S. Pat. No. 5,853,696 to Elmalch et al.\n\n\nAfter the compounds are administered to a subject (e.g., a human subject), the presence of that compound within the subject can be imaged and quantified by appropriate techniques in order to indicate the presence, quantity, and functionality of selected nicotinic cholinergic receptor subtypes. In addition to humans, the compounds can also be administered to animals, such as mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. SPECT and PET imaging can be carried out using any appropriate technique and apparatus. See Villemagne et al., In: Arneric et al. (Eds.) \nNeuronal Nicotinic Receptors: Pharmacology and Therapeutic Opportunities, \n235-250 (1998) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,853,696 to Elmalch et al. for a disclosure of representative imaging techniques.\n\n\nThe radiolabeled compounds bind with high affinity to selective nAChR subtypes (e.g., α7) and preferably exhibit negligible non-specific binding to other nicotinic cholinergic receptor subtypes (e.g., those receptor subtypes associated with muscle and ganglia). As such, the compounds can be used as agents for noninvasive imaging of nicotinic cholinergic receptor subtypes within the body of a subject, particularly within the brain for diagnosis associated with a variety of CNS diseases and disorders.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the diagnostic compositions can be used in a method to diagnose disease in a subject, such as a human patient. The method involves administering to that patient a detectably labelled compound as described herein, and detecting the binding of that compound to selected nicotinic receptor subtypes (e.g., α7 receptor subtype). Those skilled in the art of using diagnostic tools, such as PET and SPECT, can use the radiolabeled compounds described herein to diagnose a wide variety of conditions and disorders, including conditions and disorders associated with dysfunction of the central and autonomic nervous systems. Such disorders include a wide variety of CNS diseases and disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. These and other representative diseases and disorders that can be evaluated include those that are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,952,339 to Bencherif et al., the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the diagnostic compositions can be used in a method to monitor selective nicotinic receptor subtypes of a subject, such as a human patient. The method involves administering a detectably labeled compound as described herein to that patient and detecting the binding of that compound to selected nicotinic receptor subtypes (e.g., the α7 receptor subtype).\n\n\nThe following examples are provided to further illustrate the present invention, and should not be construed as limiting thereof.\n\n\nIV. Synthetic Examples\n\n\nThe following synthetic examples are provided to illustrate the present invention and should not be construed as limiting the scope thereof. In these examples, all parts and percentages are by weight, unless otherwise noted. Reaction yields are reported in mole percentage.\n\n\nThe first step in synthesizing the compounds of interest is to synthesize 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one, as described below:\n\n\n2-((3-Pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one\n\n\nPotassium hydroxide (56 g, 0.54 mole) was dissolved in methanol (420 mL). 3-Quinuclidinone hydrochloride (75 g, 0.49 mole) was added and the mixture was stirred for 30 min at ambient temperature. 3-Pyridinecarboxaldehyde (58 g, 0.54 mole) was added and the mixture stirred for 16 h at ambient temperature. The reaction mixture became yellow during this period, with solids caking on the walls of the flask. The solids were scraped from the walls and the chunks broken up. With rapid stirring, water (390 mL) was added. When the solids dissolved, the mixture was cooled at 4° C. overnight. The crystals were collected by filtration, washed with water, and air dried to obtain 80 g of yellow solid. A second crop (8 g) was obtained by concentration of the filtrate to ˜10% of its former volume and cooling at 4° C. overnight. Both crops were sufficiently pure for further transformation (88 g, 82%).\n\n\n2-((3-Pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one\n\n\n2-((3-Pyridinyl)methylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one (20 g, 93 mmol) was suspended in methanol (200 mL) and treated with 46 mL of 6N HCl. 10% Palladium on carbon (1.6 g) was added and the mixture was shaken under 25 psi hydrogen for 16 h. The mixture was filtered through Celite and solvent removed from the filtrate by rotary evaporation, to give crude 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one hydrochloride as a white gum (20 g). This was treated with 2N NaOH (50 mL) and chloroform (50 mL) and stirred for an hour. The chloroform layer was separated and the aqueous phase was treated with 2N NaOH, enough to raise the pH to 10 (about 5 mL), and saturated aqueous NaCl (25 mL). This was extracted with chloroform (3×10 mL), and the combined extracts were dried (MgSO\n4\n) and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residue (18 g) was dissolved in warm ether (320 mL) and cooled to 4° C. The white solid was filtered off, washed with a small portion of cold ether and air dried. Concentration of the filtrate to ˜10% of its former volume and cooling at 4° C. produced a second crop. A combined yield 16 g (79%) was obtained.\n\n\nThe 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one can then be used to produce the scaffolds from which the remaining examples were synthesized. The synthesis of the three scaffolds and their separation into individual enantiomers was accomplished by the following procedures.\n\n\nSCAFFOLD 1\n\n\n2-((3-Pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol\n\n\nIn accordance with the procedure reported by Warawa et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n17(5): 497 (1974), a 250 mL three-neck round bottom flask was fitted with a Vigreux column and distilling head. 2-((3-Pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one (3.00 g, 13.9 mmol), isopropanol (165 mL), aluminum isopropoxide (10.4 g, 50.9 mmol) and four boiling chips were added to the flask. The mixture was slowly distilled under nitrogen, the distillate being collected over a 3 h period. When the distillate no longer showed the presence of acetone (by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone formation), the distillation was stopped and the reaction mixture cooled to ambient temperature. The volatiles were removed by rotary evaporation and the gelatinous residue was diluted with saturated aqueous NaCl (50 mL) and 50% aqueous NaOH (10 mL). The mixture was then extracted with chloroform (3×25 mL), and the extracts were combined, dried over MgSO\n4\n, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The resulting amber oil became a cream-colored solid (3.02 g, 99.7% yield) upon high vacuum treatment. GCMS analysis indicated that the product is a 93:7 mixture of diastereomers. That the cis relative configuration of 2-[(pyridin-3-yl)methyl]quinuclidin-3-ol was the major diastereomer was established by comparison of the 3-H chemical shift with corresponding chemical shifts of cis- and trans-2-(arylmethyl)quinuclidin-3-ols (Warawa and Campbell, \nJ. Org. Chem. \n39(24): 3511 (1974)).\n\n\n(R,R) and (S,S)-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol\n\n\nA mixture of (cis)-2-((3-pridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol (1.97 g, 9.04 mmol), N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (3.73 g, 18.1 mmol), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (55 mg, 0.40 mmol), (S)-2-methoxy-2-phenylacetic acid (3.00 g, 18.1 mmol), and anhydrous dichloromethane (125 mL) was stirred at ambient temperature under nitrogen for 24 h. The precipitated N,N-dicyclohexylurea was filtered from the reaction mixture and the filtrate was extracted sequentially with water (200 mL), saturated aqueous NaHCO\n3 \n(200 mL) and saturated aqueous NaCl (200 mL). The organic layer was dried (MgSO\n4\n), filtered and concentrated to give a dark orange oil (4.45 g). A portion (4.2 g) of this diastereomeric mixture was dissolved in acetonitrile (8.4 mL) and separated, in portions, by preparative HPLC, using 90:10:0.1 acetonitrile/water/tifluoroacetic acid as eluent. The diastereomers exhibited retention times of 3.8 min and 4.5 min. The corresponding fractions from the various injections were combined and concentrated to yield 1.1 g (56% yield) and 0.70 g (36% yield), respectively as clear, colorless oils. LCMS analysis of the solvent-free esters confirmed the efficiency of their separation, showing diastereomeric purities of 92% (for the 3.8 min fraction) and 95% (for the 4.5 min fraction).\n\n\nIn separate flasks, portions (0.175 g, 0.477 mmol) of each of the diastereomers were dissolved in methanol (2.5 mL) and treated with solutions of KOH (0.20 g, 3.6 mmol) in methanol (3 mL). These mixtures were stirred overnight at ambient temperature. The methanol was removed by evaporation, and the residues were diluted with a mixture of saturated aqueous NaCl (2 mL) and 50% NaOH (1 mL) and then extracted with chloroform (3×5 mL). For each of the hydrolyses, the organic layers were combined, dried (MgSO\n4\n), filtered, and concentrated. This gave 0.061 g (59% yield) of the enantiomer derived from the 3.8 min peak and 0.056 g (54% yield) of the enantiomer derived from the 4.5 min peak. Both were clear, colorless oils.\n\n\nSCAFFOLD 2\n\n\n3-Amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane\n\n\nTo a stirred solution of 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one (3.00 g, 13.9 mmol) in dry methanol (20 mL), under nitrogen, was added a 1 M solution of ZnCl\n2 \nin ether (2.78 mL, 2.78 mmol). After stirring at ambient temperature for 30 min, this mixture was treated with solid ammonium formate (10.4 g, 167 mmol). After stirring another hour at ambient temperature, solid sodium cyanoborohydride (1.75 g, 27.8 mmol) was added in portions. The reaction was then stirred at ambient temperature overnight and terminated by addition of water (˜5 mL). The quenched reaction was partitioned between 5 M NaOH (10 mL) and chloroform (20 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with chloroform (20 mL), and combined organic layers were dried (Na\n2\nSO\n4\n), filtered and concentrated. This left 2.97 g of yellow gum. GC/MS analysis indicated that the product was a 90:10 mixture of the cis and trans amines, along with a trace of the corresponding alcohol (98% mass recovery).\n\n\n(R,R) and (S,S)-3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane\n\n\nDi-p-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid (5.33 g, 13.8 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of crude 3-amino-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (6.00 g, 27.6 mmol of 9:1 cis/trans) in methanol (20 mL). After complete dissolution, the clear solution was then concentrated to a solid mass by rotary evaporation. The solid was dissolved in a minimum amount of boiling methanol (˜5 mL). The solution was cooled slowly, first to ambient temperature (1 h), then for ˜4 h at 5° C. and finally at −5° C. overnight. The precipitated salt was collected by suction filtration and recrystallized from 5 mL of methanol. Drying left 1.4 g of white solid, which was partitioned between chloroform (5 mL) and 2 M NaOH (5 mL). The chloroform layer and a 5 mL chloroform extract of the aqueous layer were combined, dried (Na\n2\nSO\n4\n) and concentrated to give a colorless oil (0.434 g). The enantiomeric purity of this free base was determined by conversion of a portion into its N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-L-prolinamide, which was then analyzed for diastereomeric purity (98%) using LCMS.\n\n\nThe mother liquor from the initial crystallization was made basic (˜pH 11) with 2 M NaOH and extracted twice with chloroform (10 mL). The chloroform extracts were dried (Na\n2\nSO\n4\n) and concentrated to give an oil. This amine (3.00 g, 13.8 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (10 mL) and treated with di-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid (2.76 g, 6.90 mmol). The mixture was warmed to aid dissolution and then cooled slowly to −5° C., where it remained overnight. The precipitate was collected by suction filtration, recrystallized and dried. This left 1.05 g of white solid. The salt was converted into the free base as described above for the other isomer (yield=0.364 g), and the enantiomeric purity (97%) was assessed using the prolinaminde method, described above.\n\n\nSCAFFOLD 3\n\n\n3-Aminomethyl-2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane\n\n\n2-((3-Pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one (2.16 g, 0.01 mol), methylamine (25 mL, 0.05 mol) and zinc chloride (5 mL, 0.005 mol) were added to dry methanol (30 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Then, sodium cyanoborohydride (30 mL, 1.0M in THF) was added carefully and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 48 h. The mixture was adjusted to pH 10 using 2N potassium hydroxide and then the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The residue was extracted with chloroform (3×50 mL), dried (MgSO\n4\n), filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation to yield the crude desired amine as a light yellow oil (2.40 g, 83% yield). The product was taken on to the next step without further purification.\n\n\nThe following example describes the synthesis of various 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl N-arylcarbamates, which are built upon Scaffold 1. Table 1 shows a list of various compounds within this example that were synthesized.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\n2((3-Pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl N-arylcarbamates\n\n\nVarious aryl isocyanates (0.2 mmol) were combined, with 2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol (0.2 mmol) in anhydrous toluene (1 mL). The reaction mixtures were heated at 100° C. for 3 h and concentrated by centrifugal evaporation. The residues were dissolved in DMF (0.5 mL) and purified by HPLC on a C18 silica gel column, using acetonitrile/water gradients containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid as eluent. Compounds were isolated as trifluoroacetate salts and characterized by LCMS. All compounds exhibited appropriate molecular ions and fragmentation patterns. Those of 90% or greater purity were submitted for biological assessment.

The volatiles were removed by rotary evaporation, and the residue was purified by flash (silica gel) column chromatography, using first chloroform/hexane/methanol/ammonia (68:25:7:1) and then chloroform/methanol/ammonia (90:10:1) as eluent. Concentration of selected fractions gave 0.260 g (62.5% yield) of colorless oil, which formed a waxy white solid upon standing at ambient temperature. NMR analysis confirmed that the material was predominantly the cis diastereomer. This material was dissolved in 4 M HCl in dioxane and concentrated to dryness, leaving a hygroscopic white solid.\n\n\nThe following example describes the synthesis of various N-(2-((3-pyridinyl)methyl)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)arylcarboxamides, which are built upon Scaffold 2.

The reaction mixtures were stirred overnight at ambient temperature, then diluted with chloroform (2 mL) and washed with 5 M NaOH (2 mL). The organic layers were concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residues were (dissolved in methanol (0.5 ml) and purified by HPLC on a C18 silica gel column, using acetonitrile/water gradients containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid as eluent.

Animals were anesthetized with 70% CO\n2\n, then decapitated. Brains were removed and placed on an ice-cold platform. The cerebral cortex was removed and placed in 20 volumes (weight:volume) of ice-cold preparative buffer (137 mM NaCl, 10.7 mM KCl, 5.8 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 8 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 20 mM HEPES (free acid), 5 mM iodoacetamide, 1.6 mM EDTA, pH 7.4); PMSF, dissolved in methanol to a final concentration of 100 μM, was added and the suspension was homogenized by Polytron. The homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000×g for 20 min at 4° C. and the resulting pellet was re-suspended in 20 volumes of ice-cold water. After 60 min incubation on ice, a new pellet was collected by centrifugation at 18,000×g for 20 min at 4° C. The final pellet was re-suspended in 10 volumes of buffer and stored at −20° C. On the day of the assay, tissue was thawed, centrifuged at 18,000×g for 20 min, and then re-suspended in ice-cold PBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline, 138 mM NaCl, 2.67 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 8.1 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.9 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, Invitrogen/Gibco, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of approximately 4 mg protein/mL. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n193: 265 (1951), using bovine serum albumin as the standard.\n\n\nThe binding of [\n3\nH]nicotine was measured using a modification of the methods of Romano et al., \nScience \n210: 647 (1980) and Marks et al., \nMol. Pharmacol. \n30: 427 (1986). The [\n3\nH]nicotine (Specific Activity=81.5 Ci/mmol) was obtained from INEN Research Products. The binding of [\n3\nH]nicotine was measured using a 3 h incubation at 4° C. Incubations were conducted in 48-well micro-titre plates and contained about 400 μg of protein per well in a final incubation volume of 300 μL. The incubation buffer was PBS and the final concentration of [\n3\nH]nicotine was 5 nM. The binding reaction was terminated by filtration of the protein containing bound ligand onto glass fiber filters (GF/B, Brandel) using a Brandel Tissue Harvester at 4° C. Filters were soaked in de-ionized water containing 0.33% polyethyleneimine to reduce non-specific binding. Each filter was washed with ice-cold buffer (3×1 mL). Non-specific binding was determined by inclusion of 10 μM non-radioactive L-nicotine (Acros Organics) in selected wells.\n\n\nThe inhibition of [\n3\nH]nicotine binding by test compounds was determined by including seven different concentrations of the test compound in selected wells. Each concentration was replicated in triplicate. IC\n50 \nvalues were estimated as the concentration of compound that inhibited 50 percent of specific [\n3\nH]nicotine binding. Inhibition constants (Ki values), reported in nM, were calculated from the IC\n50 \nvalues using the method of Cheng et al., \nBiochem. Pharmacol. \n22: 3099 (1973).\n\n\nFor initial screening, a single concentration of test compounds was tested in the above assay format with the following modifications.

The binding of [\n3\nH]epibatidine was measured using a 2 h incubation at 21° C. (room temperature). Incubations were conducted in 96-well Millipore Multiscreen (MAFB) plates containing about 200 μg of protein per well in a final incubation volume of 150 μL. The incubation buffer was PBS and the final concentration of [\n3\nH]epibatidine was 0.3 nM. The binding reaction was terminated by filtration of the protein containing bound ligand onto the glass fiber filter base of the Multiscreen plates. Filters were soaked in de-ionized water containing 0.33% polyethyleneimine to reduce non-specific binding. Each filter was washed with ice-cold buffer (3×0.25 mL). Non-specific binding was determined by inclusion of 10 μM non-radioactive L-nicotine (Acros Organics) in selected wells. The single concentration of test compound was 5 μM and testing was performed in triplicate. ‘Active’ compounds were defined as compounds that inhibited the binding of [\n3\nH]epibatidine to the receptor by at least 50% compared with the binding of [\n3\nH]epibatidine in the absence of competitor. For those compounds found to be active in the single point screen, the inhibition constants (Ki values) were determined as described in the previous paragraphs of this section.\n\n\nα7 nAChR Subtype\n\n\nRats (female, Sprague-Dawley), weighing 150-250 g, were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle and were allowed free access to water and food supplied by PMI Nutrition International, Inc.

[\n3\nH]MLA (Specific Activity=25-35 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Tocris. The binding of [\n3\nH]MLA was determined using a 2 h incubation at 21° C. Incubations were conducted in 48-well micro-titre plates and contained about 200 μg of protein per well in a final incubation volume of 300 μL. The incubation buffer was PBS and the final concentration of [\n3\nH]MLA was 5 nM. The binding reaction was terminated by filtration of the protein containing bound ligand onto glass fiber filters (GF/B, Brandel) using a Brandel Tissue Harvester at room temperature. Filters were soaked in de-ionized water containing 0.33% polyethyleneimine to reduce non-specific binding. Each filter was washed with PBS (3×1 mL) at room temperature. Non-specific binding was determined by inclusion of 50 μM non-radioactive MLA in selected wells.\n\n\nThe inhibition of [\n3\nH]MLA binding by test compounds was determined by including seven different concentrations of the test compound in selected wells. Each concentration was replicated in triplicate. IC\n50 \nvalues were estimated as the concentration of compound that inhibited 50 percent of specific [\n3\nH]MLA binding. Inhibition constants (Ki values), reported in nM, were calculated from the IC\n50 \nvalues using the method of Cheng et al., \nBiochem. Pharmacol. \n22: 3099-3108 (1973).\n\n\nFor initial screening, a single concentration of test compounds was tested in the above assay format with the following modifications. Incubations were conducted in 96-well plates in a final incubation volume of 150 μL. Once the binding reaction was terminated by filtration onto glass fiber filters, the filters were washed four times with approximately 250 μL of PBS at room temperature. Non-specific binding was determined by inclusion of 10 μM non-radioactive MLA in selected wells. The single concentration of test compound was 5 μM and testing was performed in triplicate. ‘Active’ compounds were defined as compounds that inhibited the binding of [\n3\nH]MLA to the receptor by at least 50% compared with the binding of [\n3\nH]MLA in the absence of competitor. For those compounds found to be active in the single point screen, the inhibition constants (Ki values) were determined as described in the previous paragraphs of this section.\n\n\nDetermination of Dopamine Release\n\n\nDopamine release was measured using striatal synaptosomes obtained from rat brain, according to the procedures set forth by Rapier et al., \nJ. Neurochem. \n54: 937 (1990). Rats (female, Sprague-Dawley), weighing 150-250 g, were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle and were allowed free access to water and food supplied by PMI Nutrition International, Inc. Animals were anesthetized with 70% CO\n2\n, then decapitated. The brains were quickly removed and the striata dissected. Striatal tissue from each of 2 rats was pooled and homogenized in ice-cold 0.32 M sucrose (5 mL) containing 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, using a glass/glass homogenizer. The tissue was then centrifuged at 1,000×g for 10 min. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000×g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was re-suspended in perfusion buffer containing monoamine oxidase inhibitors (128 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.4 mM KCl, 3.2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1.2 mM MgSO\n4\n, 25 mM HEPES, 1 mM ascorbic acid, 0.02 mM pargyline HCl and 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) and centrifuged for 15 min at 25,000×g. The final pellet was resuspended in perfusion buffer (1.4 mL) for immediate use.\n\n\nThe synaptosomal suspension was incubated for 10 min at 37° C. to restore metabolic activity. [\n3\nH]Dopamine ([\n3\nH]DA, specific activity=28.0 Ci/mmol, NEN Research Products) was added at a final concentration of 0.1 μM and the suspension was incubated at 37° C. for another 10 min. Aliquots of tissue (50 μL) and perfusion buffet (100 μL) were loaded into the suprafusion chambers of a Brandel Suprafusion System (series 2500, Gaithersburg, Md.). Perfusion buffer (room temperature) was pumped into the chambers at a rate of 3 mL/min for a wash period of 8 min. Test compound (10 μM) or nicotine (10 μM) was then applied in the perfusion stream for 40 sec. Fractions (12 sec each) were continuously collected from each chamber throughout the experiment to capture basal release and agonist-induced peak release and to re-establish the baseline after the agonist application. The perfusate was collected directly into scintillation vials, to which scintillation fluid was added. [\n3\nH]DA released was quantified by scintillation counting. For each chamber, the integrated area of the peak was normalized to its baseline.\n\n\nRelease was expressed as a percentage of release obtained with an equal concentration of L-nicotine. Within each assay, each test compound was replicated using 2-3 chambers; replicates were averaged. When appropriate, dose-response curves of test compound were determined. The maximal activation for individual compounds (Emax) was determined as a percentage of the maximal activation induced by L-nicotine. The compound concentration resulting in half maximal activation (EC\n50\n) of specific ion flux was also defined.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\nSelectivity vs. Peripheral nAChRs\n\n\nInteraction at the Human Muscle nAChR Subtype\n\n\nActivation of muscle-type nAChRs was established on the human clonal line TE671/RD, which is derived from an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (Stratton et al., Carcinogen 10: 899 (1989)). These cells express receptors that have pharmacological (Lukas, \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n251: 175 (1989)), electrophysiological (Oswald et al., \nNeurosci. Lett. \n96: 207 (1989)), and molecular biological profiles (Luther et al., \nJ. Neurosci. \n9: 1082 (1989)) similar to the muscle-type nAChR.\n\n\nTE671/RD cells were maintained in proliferative growth phase according to routine protocols (Bencherif et al., \nMol. Cell. Neurosci. \n2: 52 (1991) and Bencherif et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n257: 946 (1991)). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco/BRL) with 10% horse serum (Gibco/BRL), 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan Utah), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 4 mM L-Glutamine, and 50,000 units penicillin-streptomycin (Irvine Scientific). When cells were 80% confluent, they were plated to 6 well polystyrene plates (Costar). Experiments were conducted when the cells reached 100% confluency.\n\n\nNicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function was assayed using \n86\nRb\n+\n efflux according to the method described by Lukas et al., \nAnal. Biochem. \n175: 212 (1988). On the day of the experiment, growth media was gently removed from the well and growth media containing \n86\nRubidium chloride (10\n6 \nμCi/mL) was added to each well. Cells were incubated at 37° C. for a minimum of 3 h. After the loading period, excess \n86\nRb\n+\n was removed and the cells were washed twice with label-free Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (138 mM NaCl, 2.67 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 8.1 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.9 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, Invitrogen/Gibco, pH. 7.4), taking care not to disturb the cells. Next, cells were exposed to either 100 μM of test compound, 100 μM of L-nicotine (Acros Organics) or buffer alone for 4 min. Following the exposure period, the supernatant containing the released \n86\nRb\n+\n was removed and transferred to scintillation vials. Scintillation fluid was added and released radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting.\n\n\nWithin each assay, each point had 2 replicates, which were averaged. The amount of \n86\nRb\n+\n release was compared to both a positive control (100 μM L-nicotine) and a negative control (buffer alone) to determine the percent release relative to that of L-nicotine.\n\n\nWhen appropriate, dose-response curves of test compound were determined. The maximal activation for individual compounds (Emax) was determined as a percentage of the maximal activation induced by L-nicotine. The compound concentration resulting in half maximal activation (EC\n50\n) of specific ion flux was also determined.\n\n\nInteraction at the Rat Ganglionic nAChR Subtype\n\n\nActivation of rat ganglion nAChRs was established on the pheochromocytoma clonal line PC 12, which is a continuous clonal cell line of neural crest origin, derived from a tumor of the rat adrenal medulla. These cells express ganglion-like nAChR s (see Whiting et al., \nNature \n327: 515 (1987); Lukas, \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n251: 175 (1989); Whiting et al., \nMol. Brain Res. \n10: 61 (1990)).\n\n\nRat PC 12 cells were maintained in proliferative growth phase according to routine protocols (Bencherif et al., \nMol. Cell. Neurosci. \n2: 52 (1991) and Bencherif et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n257: 946 (1991)).

When cells were 80% confluent, they were plated to 6 well Nunc plates (Nunclon) and coated with 0.03% poly-L-lysine (Sigma, dissolved in 100 mM boric acid). Experiments were conducted when the cells reached 80% confluency.\n\n\nNicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function was assayed using \n86\nRb\n+\n efflux according to a method described by Lukas et al., \nAnal.

The compound concentration resulting in half maximal activation (EC\n50\n) of specific ion flux was also determined.\n\n\nInteraction at the Human Ganglionic nAChR Subtype\n\n\nThe cell line SH—SY5Y is a continuous line derived by sequential subcloning of the parental cell line, SK—N—SH, which was originally obtained from a human peripheral neuroblastoma. SH—SY5Y cells express a ganglion-like nAChR (Lukas et al., \nMol. Cell. Neurosci. \n4: 1 (1993)).\n\n\nHuman SH—SY5Y cells were maintained in proliferative growth phase according to routine protocols (Bencherif et al., \nMol. Cell. Neurosci. \n2: 52 (1991) and Bencherif et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n257: 946 (1991)).

As evidenced through pharmacological (Bencherif et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n257: 946 (1991) and Lukas, \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n251: 175 (1989)), electrophysiological (Oswald et al., \nNeurosci. Lett. \n96: 207 (1989)), and molecular biological studies (Luther et al., \nJ. Neurosci. \n9: 1082 (1989)) these cells express muscle-like nicotinic receptors.\n\n\nTE671/RD cells were maintained in proliferative growth phase according to routine protocols (Bencherif et al., \nMol. Cell. Neurosci. \n2: 52 (1991) and Bencherif et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n257: 946 (1991)). They were grown to confluency on 20-150 mm tissue culture treated plates. The media was then removed and cells scraped using 80 mL of PBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline, 138 mM NaCl, 2.67 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 8.1 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.9 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, Invitrogen/Gibco, pH 7.4) and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was then suctioned off and the pellet(s) stored at −20° C. until use.\n\n\nOn the day of the assay, the pellets were thawed, re-suspended with PBS and centrifuged at 18,000×g for 20 min, then re-suspended in PBS to a final concentration of approximately 4 mg protein/mL and homogenized by Polytron.\n\n\nProtein was determined by the method of Lowry et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n193: 265 (1951), using bovine serum albumin as the standard.\n\n\nThe binding of [\n3\nH]QNB was measured using a modification of the methods of Bencherif et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n257: 946 (1991). [\n3\nH]QNB (Specific Activity=30-60 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Research Products. The binding of [\n3\nH]QNB was measured using a 3 h incubation at 4° C. Incubations were conducted in 48-well micro-titre plates and contained about 400 μg of protein per well in a final incubation volume of 300 μL. The incubation buffer was PBS and the final concentration of [\n3\nH]QNB was 1 nM. The binding reaction was terminated by filtration of the protein containing bound ligand onto glass fiber filters (GF/B, Brandel) using a Brandel Tissue (Harvester at 4° C. Filters were pre-soaked in de-ionized water containing 0.33% polyethyleneimine to reduce non-specific binding. Each filter was washed with ice-cold buffer (3×1 mL). Non-specific binding was determined by inclusion of 10 μM non-radioactive atropine in selected wells.\n\n\nThe inhibition of [\n3\nH]QNB binding by test compounds was determined by including seven different concentrations of the test compound in selected wells. Each concentration was replicated in triplicate. IC\n50 \nvalues were estimated as the concentration of compound that inhibited 50 percent of specific [\n3\nH]QNB binding. Inhibition constants (Ki values), reported in nM, were calculated from the IC\n50 \nvalues using the method of Cheng et al., \nBiochem. Pharmacol. \n22: 3099 (1973).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\nDetermination of Activity at the α7 nAChR Subtype\n\n\nSelective α7 agonists can be found using a functional assay on FLIPR (see, for example, PCT WO 00/73431 A2, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference), which is a commercially available high throughput assay (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, Calif.). FLIPR is designed to read the fluorescent signal from each well of a 96 or 384 well plate as fast as twice a second for up to 30 minutes. This assay can be used to accurately measure the functional pharmacology of α7 nAChR and 5HT\n3\nR subtypes. Cell lines that express functional forms of the α7 nAChR subtype using the α7/5-HT\n3 \nchannel as the drug target and/or cell lines that express functional 5-HT\n3 \nare used to conduct the assay. In both cases, the ligand-gated ion channels are expressed in SH-EP1 cells. Both ion channels can produce a robust signal in the FLIPR assay. Using the FLIPR assay, the compounds described herein can be evaluated for their ability to function as agonists, partial agonists or antagonists at the α7 nAChR subtype.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\nSummary of Biological Activity\n\n\nCompounds 1-34 competitively inhibited the binding of radiolabeled MLA to rat brain hippocampus α7 nAChR subtypes with an equilibrium constant (Ki) values of 0.5-60 nM, indicating that they have very high affinity for the α7 nAChR subtype. High-throughput screening indicated that none of the compounds bound to α4β2 nAChR subtypes with any significant affinity (Ki values>10 μM).\n\n\nCompounds 1-34 exhibited little or no agonist activity in functional models bearing muscle-type receptors (α1β1γδ subtype in human TE671/RD clonal cells), or ganglion-type receptors (α3β4 subtype in the Shooter subclone of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and in human SHSY-5Y clonal cells), generating only 1-12% (human muscle), 1-19% (rat ganglion) and 1-15% (human ganglion) of nicotine's response at these subtypes. These data indicate selectivity for CNS over PNS nAChRs. Because similar compounds had been described by others as exhibiting muscarinic activity (see, for instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,270 to Sabb and PCTs WO 02/00652 and WO 02/051841), representative compounds (#s 1, 2, 4, 9 and 11) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit [\n3\nH]QNB binding at muscarinic sites in the human clonal line TE671/RD. None of the compounds was able to inhibit [\n3\nH]QNB binding, indicating that these compounds do not bind to human M3 receptors. Thus, compounds of the present invention are distinguished in their in vitro pharmacology from reference compounds (see, for instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,270 to Sabb and PCTs WO 02/00652 and WO 02/051841) by virtue of the inclusion, in their structure, of the 3-pyridinylmethyl substituent in the 2 position of the 1-azabicycle.\n\n\nFollowing up on this intriguing finding, a comparison of α7 nAChR binding affinities was undertaken, to determine the effect of the 2-(3-pyridinyl)methyl substituent. The results are shown in Table 5. It is clear from the data that inclusion of the 2-(3-pyridinyl)-C\n1-4\nalkyl, preferably 2-(3-pyridinyl)methyl, substituent in the structure substantially increases binding affinity. Thus, compounds of the present invention exhibit both greater affinity at and greater selectivity for α7 nAChR subtypes than those compounds which lack the 2-(3-pyridinyl)alkyl, preferably 2-(3-pyridinyl)methyl, substituent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStructure\n\n\na7 Ki (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n120\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data show that the compounds of the present invention are potent α7 nicotinic ligands that selectively bind at α7 nAChR subtypes. In contrast, the compounds of the present invention do not bind well at those subtypes of the nAChR that are characteristic of the peripheral nervous system or at M3 muscarinic receptors. Thus, the compounds of the present invention possess therapeutic potential in treating central nervous system disorders without producing side effects associated with interaction with the peripheral nervous system. The affinity of these ligands for α7 nAChR subtypes is tolerant of a wide variety of aryl (Ar in Formula 1) groups and substituents thereon. Furthermore, the synthesis is straightforward, efficient and amenable to massively parallel protocols.\n\n\nHaving disclosed the subject matter of the present invention, it should be apparent that many modifications, substitutions and variations of the present invention are possible in light thereof. It is to be understood that the present invention can be practiced other than as specifically described. Such modifications, substitutions and variations are intended to be within the scope of the present application."
