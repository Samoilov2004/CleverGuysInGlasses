Description\n\n\n\n\n COMPOUNDS FOR THE TREATMENT OF HEPATITIS C \n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application serial number 61/375,060 filed August 19, 2010. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The disclosure generally relates to the novel compounds of formula I including pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which have activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV) and are useful in treating those infected with HCV. The disclosure also relates to compositions and methods of using these compounds. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronically infects an estimated 170 million people worldwide, with 3 to 4 million infected individuals in the United States alone (Boyer, N. and Marcellin, P. J Hepatology. 2000, 32:98-112; Alter, M. J., et al. Engl. J. Med. 1999, 341 :556-562). Prior to the mid 1990s, transfusion with infected blood products was the main route of HCV transmission. Following the introduction of blood screening methods, transmission via injection drug use became the primary risk factor. Chronic infection often leads to the development of severe liver \n\n\ncomplications, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV infection is also the leading cause of orthotopic liver transplantation in the United States. The degree to which disease progression is related to viral and cellular factors is not completely understood. \n\n\nConsiderable heterogeneity is found within the nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequence of the HCV genome (Simmonds, P. J. Gen. Virology. 2004, 85:3173- 3188). Based on this sequence diversity, six major genotypes and multiple associated subtypes have been described. The genotypes of HCV differ in their worldwide distribution, and the clinical significance of the genetic heterogeneity of HCV remains elusive despite numerous studies of the possible effect of genotypes on pathogenesis and therapy, \n\n Medical treatment for HCV is limited by the lack of a vaccine or approved therapies that specifically target the virus. Currently, patients undergo treatment with a combination of parenterally administered pegylated alpha-interferon and oral ribavirin. Genotype 1 HCV is the most difficult to treat and elimination of the virus (sustained virologic response) is achieved for only approximately 50% of patients (Fried, M. W. et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002, 347:975-982; Zeumzem, S. Nature Clinical Practice. 2008, 5:610-622). This poor treatment response, combined with often severe side effects induced by therapy, highlight a need for improved antiviral drugs with better efficacy and safety profiles. \n\n\nHCV is a member of the Flaviviridae family of viruses with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. Following infection of host cells, the 9.6 Kb genome is translated into a polyprotein precursor of approximately 3,000 amino acids (reviewed in Lindenbach, B. D. and Rice, C. M. Nature. 2005, 436:933-938; Moradpour, D, Penin, F., and Rice, C. M. Nature Reviews. 2007, 5:453-463). PosMranslational processing by both cellular and viral proteases results in the generation of at least 10 separate viral proteins. The structural proteins (which by definition are found in mature virions) include core, El, E2, and possibly p7, and originate from the amino- terminal region of the polyprotein. The core protein assembles into the viral nucleocapsid. The El and E2 glycoproteins form heterodimers that are found within the lipid envelope surrounding the viral particles, and mediate host cell receptor binding and entry of the virus into cells. It is unclear if p7 is a structural protein, and its role in replication has yet to be defined. However p7 is believed to form an ion channel in cellular membranes, preventing acidification of intracellular compartments in which virions are assembled, and it has been shown to be essential for viral replication and assembly, The nonstructural proteins NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B are produced through maturational cleavages of the carboxy- terminal region of the polyprotein. NS2 along with the amino terminus of NS3 form the NS2-3 metalloprotease which cleaves at the NS2-NS3 junction. Additionally, NS2 is involved in assembly and egress of nascent virions. The NS3 protein contains both a serine protease in its amino-terminal region, and a nucleotide-dependent RNA helicase in its carboxy-terminal region. NS3 forms a heterodimer with the NS4A protein, constituting the active protease which mediates cleavages of the polyprotein \n\n downstream of NS3, both in cis, at the NS3-NS4A cleavage site, and in trans, for the remaining NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, NS5A-NS5B sites. The complex formation of the NS3 protein with NS4A seems necessary to the processing events, enhancing the proteolytic efficiency at all of the sites. The NS3 protein also exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase and RNA helicase activities. The NS4B protein has been shown to be important for localization of HCV proteins into replication complexes in altered membranous structures within the ceil. NS5B encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is involved in the replication of HCV. Subgenomic HCV replicons, containing the untranslated regions 5' and 3' to the coding sequence fused to the nonstructural proteins or the full-length polypiotein, are competent for translation, viral protein expression, and replication within cultured cells (Lohmann, V. et al. Science, 1999, 285:110-113; Moradpour, D, Penin, F., and Rice, C. M. Nature Reviews. 2007, 5:453-463). The replicon system has proven valuable for the identification of inhibitors targeting the nonstructural proteins associated with these functions. However, only limited subsets of HCV genotypes have been used to generate functional replicons.. \n\n\nOther systems have been used to study the biology of the HCV structural proteins that mediate the entry into host cells. For example, virus-like-particles made in recombinant baculovirus-infected cells with the HCV core, El and E2 proteins have also been used to study the function of the HCV El and E2 proteins (Barth, H., et al. J Biol. Che . 2003, 278:41003-41012). In addition, pseudotyping systems where the El and E2 glycoproteins are used to functionally replace the glycoproteins of retroviruses have been developed (Bartosch, B., Dubuisson, J. and Cosset, F.-L, J Exp. Med. 2003, 197:633-642; Hsu, M. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA. 2003, \n\n\n100:7271-7276). These systems yield HCV pseudoparticles that bind to and enter host cells in a manner which is believed to be analogous to the natural virus, thus making them a convenient tool to study the viral entry steps as well as to identify inhibitors block this process. \n\n\nRecently, a full-length genotype 2a HCV clone, JFH1, was isolated and demonstrated the ability to replicate in vitro. Through repeated passage and \n\n adaptation in cell culture increased titers of infectious virus were produced \n\n\n(Lindenbach, B. D., et al, Science. 2005, 309:623-626; Wakita, T. et al. Nature Med. 2005, 11 :791-796). In contrast to the HCV replicon or pseudotyping systems, the infectious virus is useful for studying the complete HCV replication cycle, including identifying inhibitors of not only the replication proteins, but those involved in early steps in virus infection (entry and uncoating) and production of progeny viruses (genome packaging, nucleocapsid assembly, virion envelopment and egress). \n\n\nThe invention provides technical advantages, for example, the compounds are novel and are effective against hepatitis C.

Parenthetic and multiparenthetic terms are intended to clarify bonding relationships to those skilled in the art. For example, a term such as ((R)alkyl) means an alkyl substituent further substituted with the substituent R. \n\n\nThe substituents described above may be attached at any suitable point of attachment unless otherwise specified. However, it is understood that the compounds encompassed by the present invention are those that are chemically stable as understood by those skilled in the art. Additionally, the compounds encompassed by the present disclosure are those that are suitably stable for use as a pharmaceutical agent. \n\n\nThe invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of the compounds. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those in which the counter ions do not contribute significantly to the physiological activity or toxicity of the compounds and as such function as pharmacological equivalents. These salts can be made according to common organic techniques employing commercially available reagents. Some anionic salt forms include acetate, acistrate, besylate, bromide, camsylate, chloride, citrate, fumarate, glucouronate, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, hydroiodide, iodide, lactate, maleate, mesylate, nitrate, pamoate, phosphate, \n\n succinate, sulfate, tartrate, tosylate, and xinofoate. Some cationic salt forms include ammonium, aluminum, benzathine, bismuth, calcium, choline, diethylamine, diethanolamine, lithium, magnesium, meglumine, 4-phenylcyclohexylamine, piperazine, potassium, sodium, tromethamine, and zinc. \n\n\nSome of the compounds of the invention possess asymmetric carbon atoms (see, for example, the structures below). The invention includes all stereoisomeric forms, including enantiomers and diastereomers as well as mixtures of stereoisomers such as racemates. Some stereoisomers can be made using methods known in the art. Stereoisomeric mixtures of the compounds and related intermediates can be separated into individual isomers according to methods commonly known in the art. The use of wedges or hashes in the depictions of molecular structures in the following schemes and tables is intended only to indicate relative stereochemistry, and should not be interpreted as implying absolute stereochemical assignments. \n\n\nThe invention is intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include deuterium and tritium. Isotopes of carbon include \n13\nC and \n14\nC. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional techniques kno to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described herein, using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed. Such compounds may have a variety of potential uses, for example as standards and reagents in determining biological activity. In the case of stable isotopes, such compounds may have the potential to favorably modify biological, pharmacological, or pharmacokinetic properties. \n\n\nBiological Methods \n\n\nInfection assays. HCV pseudoparticles, produced using standardized methodology (Bartosch, B., Dubuisson, J. and Cosset, F.-L. J Exp. Med. 2003, \n\n\n197:633-642) were made via a liposome-based transfection procedure of 293T cells \n\n with plasmids expressing the murine leukemia virus capsid and polymerase proteins, an MLV genome encoding the luciferase reporter gene, and envelope glycoproteins from either HCV or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The HCV El and E2 envelope coding sequences (genotype lb) were amplified and isolated from infected patient serum, Media containing pseudoparticles was collected 3 days following \n\n\ntransfection, filtered, and stored at -20Â°C as a viral stock. Infections were performed in 384-well plates by mixing pseudovirus with 1 x 10\n4\n Huh7 cells/well in the presence or absence of test inhibitors, followed by incubation at 37Â°C. Luciferase activity, reflecting the degree of entry of the pseudoparticles into host cells, was measured 2 days after infection. The specificity of the compounds for inhibiting HCV was determined by evaluating inhibition of VSV pseudoparticle infection, \n\n\nCompounds and data analysis. Test compounds were serially diluted 3-fold in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to give a final concentration range in the assay of 50.0 Î¼Î to 0.04 pM, Maximum activity (100% of control) and background were derived from control wells containing DMSO but no inhibitor or from uninfected wells, respectively. The individual signals in each of the compound test wells were then divided by the averaged control values after background subtraction and multiplied by 100% to determine percent activity.

The compounds of this invention are generally given as pharmaceutical compositions comprised of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt and a pharmaceutically acceptable earner and may contain conventional excipients. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are those conventionally known earners having acceptable safety profiles. Compositions encompass all common solid and liquid forms including for example capsules, tablets, losenges, and powders as well as liquid suspensions, syrups, elixers, and solutions. Compositions are made using common formulation techniques, and conventional excipients (such as binding and wetting agents) and vehicles (such as water and alcohols) are generally used for compositions. See, for example, \n\n\nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, 17th edition, 1985. \n\n\nSolid compositions are normally formulated in dosage units and compositions providing from about 1 to 1000 mg of the active ingredient per dose are preferred. Some examples of dosages are 1 mg, 10 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg, and 1000 mg. Generally, other agents will be present in a unit range similar to agents of that class used clinically. Typically, this is 0,25-1000 mg/unit. \n\n\nLiquid compositions are usually in dosage unit ranges. Generally, the liquid composition will be in a unit dosage range of 1-100 mg mL. Some examples of \n\n dosages are 1 mg/mL, 10 mg mL, 25 mg/mL, 50 mg/mL, and 100 mg/mL. \n\n\n Generally, other agents will be present in a unit range similar to agents of that class used clinically. Typically, this is 1-100 mg/mL. The invention encompasses all conventional modes of administration; oral and parenteral methods are preferred. Generally, the dosing regimen will be similar to other agents used clinically. Typically, the daily dose will be 1-100 mg/kg body weight daily, Generally, more compound is required orally and less parenterally. The specific dosing regime, however, will be determined by a physician using sound medical judgement. \n\n\nThe invention also encompasses methods where the compound is given in combination therapy. That is, the compound can be used in conjunction with, but separately from, other agents useful in treating hepatitis and HCV infection. In these combination methods, the compound will generally be given in a daily dose of 1 - 100 mg/kg body weight daily in conjunction with other agents.
