Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application claims priority to U.S. Application Ser. No. 61/033,348, filed on Mar. 3, 2008 and U.S. Application Ser. No. 61/127,830, filed on May 14, 2008. The disclosures of the prior applications are considered part of (and are incorporated by reference in) the disclosure of this application.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nMatrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc metalloendopeptidases secreted by cells, and are responsible for much of the turnover of matrix components. The MMP family consists of at least 26 members, all of which share a common catalytic core with a zinc molecule in the active site.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nThis disclosure relates, inter alia, to proteins that bind MMP-12, herein referred to as “MMP-12 binding proteins,” and methods of identifying and using such proteins. These proteins include antibodies and antibody fragments (e.g., primate antibodies and Fabs, especially human antibodies and Fabs) that bind to MMP-12 (e.g., human MMP-12). In some embodiments, these proteins include antibodies and antibody fragments (e.g., primate antibodies and Fabs, especially human antibodies and Fabs) that inhibit MMP-12 (e.g., human MMP-12) (e.g., inhibit the catalytic activity of MMP-12). The MMP-12 binding proteins can be used in the treatment of diseases, particularly human disease, such as cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, aneurysm, wound healing, aging, and nerve damage in which excess or inappropriate activity of MMP-12 features. In many cases, the proteins have tolerable low or no toxicity.\n\n\nIn some aspects, the disclosure relates to proteins (e.g., antibodies, peptides and Kunitz domain proteins) that bind MMP-12, in particular, proteins (e.g., antibodies (e.g., human antibodies), peptides and Kunitz domain proteins) that bind and inhibit MMP-12.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the disclosure provides a human antibody that binds to human MMP-12. In one embodiment, the human antibody is an inhibitor of the catalytic activity of MMP-12. The antibody can be, e.g., an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, Fab, Fab2′, scFv, minibody, scFv::Fc fusion, Fab::HSA fusion, HSA::Fab fusion, Fab::HSA::Fab fusion, or other molecule that comprises the antigen combining site of one of the antibodies herein listed. In one embodiment, the antibody is used to guide a nano-particle or toxin to a cell expressing MMP-12 on the cell surface. In one embodiment, the antibody causes effector functions (CDC or ADCC) to kill the cell which expresses MMP-12.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the VH and VL regions of the binding proteins (e.g., Fabs) can be provided as IgG, Fab, Fab2, Fab2′, scFv, PEGylated Fab, PEGylated scFv, PEGylated Fab2, VH::CH1::HSA+LC, HSA::VH::CH1+LC, LC::HSA+VH::CH1, HSA::LC+VH::CH1, or other appropriate construct.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the binding protein comprises a Kunitz domain protein or modified version (e.g., HSA fusion) or peptide-based MMP-12 binding protein that can inhibit MMP-12 activity.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the disclosure features a protein (e.g., an isolated protein) that binds to MMP-12 (e.g., human MMP-12) and includes at least one immunoglobulin variable region. For example, the protein includes a heavy chain (HC) immunoglobulin variable domain sequence and a light chain (LC) immunoglobulin variable domain sequence. In one embodiment, the protein binds to and inhibits MMP-12 (e.g., inhibits MMP-12 catalytic activity), e.g., human MMP-12.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the protein binds to human MMP-12 specifically, and not to MMP-12 from another species (e.g., the protein does not bind to MMP-12 from another species with greater than background levels of binding).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the protein binds MMP-12 specifically, and not to another matrix metalloproteinase (e.g., the protein does not bind to any other matrix metalloproteinase with greater than background levels of binding).\n\n\nSuch binding proteins can be conjugated to a drug (e.g., to form a MMP-12 binding protein-drug conjugate) and used therapeutically. This disclosure relates, in part, to MMP-12 binding protein-drug conjugates, the preparation of these conjugates, and uses thereof. The conjugates can be used, e.g., in the treatment of disorders, e.g., for the treatment of cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, aneurysm, wound healing, aging, or nerve damage. Targeting (e.g., a killing) of the MMP-12 expressing cells and/or tumors, e.g., with high affinity binding protein-drug conjugates can be a potent therapy in the treatment of diseases, e.g., cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, aneurysm, wound healing, aging, and nerve damage.\n\n\nThe protein can include one or more of the following characteristics: (a) a human CDR or human framework region; (b) the HC immunoglobulin variable domain sequence comprises one or more (e.g., 1, 2, or 3) CDRs that are at least 85, 88, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 100% identical to a CDR of a HC variable domain described herein; (c) the LC immunoglobulin variable domain sequence comprises one or more (e.g., 1, 2, or 3) CDRs that are at least 85, 88, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 100% identical to a CDR of a LC variable domain described herein; (d) the LC immunoglobulin variable domain sequence is at least 85, 88, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 100% identical to a LC variable domain described herein; (e) the HC immunoglobulin variable domain sequence is at least 85, 88, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 100% identical to a HC variable domain described herein; (f) the protein binds an epitope bound by a protein described herein, or an epitope that overlaps with such epitope; and (g) a primate CDR or primate framework region.\n\n\nThe protein can bind to MMP-12, e.g., human MMP-12, with a binding affinity of at least 10\n5\n, 10\n6\n, 10\n7\n, 10\n8\n, 10\n9\n, 10\n10 \nand 10\n11 \nM\n−1\n. In one embodiment, the protein binds to MMP-12 with a K\noff \nslower than 1×10\n−3\n, 5×10\n−4 \ns\n−1\n, or 1×10\n−4 \ns\n−1\n. In one embodiment, the protein binds to MMP-12 with a K\non \nfaster than 1×10\n2\n, 1×10\n3\n, or 5×10\n3 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1\n. In one embodiment, the protein inhibits human MMP-12 activity, e.g., with a Ki of less than 10\n−5\n, 10\n−6\n, 10\n−7\n, 10\n−8\n, 10\n−9\n, and 10\n−10 \nM. The protein can have, for example, an IC\n50 \nof less than 100 nM, 10 nM or 1 nM. In some embodiments, the protein has an IC\n50 \nof about 1.8 nM. The affinity of the protein for MMP-12 can be characterized by a K\nD \nof less than 100 nm, less than 10 nM, or about 3 nM (e.g., 3.1 nM), about 5 nM (e.g., 5 nM), about 6 nm (e.g., 5.9 nM), about 7 nM (e.g., 7.1 nM), or about 10 nM (e.g., 9.6 nM).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the protein has a K\nD\n<200 nM.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the protein has a t1/2 of at least about 10 minutes (e.g., 11 minutes), at least about 20 minutes (e.g., 18 minutes), at least about 25 minutes (e.g., 25 minutes), at least about 35 minutes (e.g., 33 minutes), or at least about 60 minutes (e.g., 57 minutes).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the protein binds the catalytic domain of human MMP-12, e.g., the protein contacts residues in or near the active site of MMP-12.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the protein does not contact residues in or near the active site of MMP-12 but instead binds elsewhere on MMP-12 and causes a steric change in MMP-12 that affects (e.g., inhibits) its activity.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the protein is a human antibody having the light and heavy chains of antibodies picked from the list comprising M0134-A02, M134-A05, M134-A07, M134-A09, M134-A10, M134-A11, M0134-B01, M134-B04, M0134-B08, M0134-B11, M0134-C01, M0134-C02, M0134-C06, M0134-C09, M0134-C10, M0134-C11, M0134-C12, M0134-D02, M0134-DO3, M0134-E04, M0134-E07, M0134-E08, M134-E11, M0134-F01, M0134-F05, M0134-G02, M0134-G04, M0134-G07, M0135-A03, M0135-A05, M0135-A06, M0135-A07, M0135-B02, M0135-B08, M0135-C01, M0135-C11, M0135-E03, M0135-F03, M0135-F11, M0135-G02, M0135-G03, M0135-G07, M0135-G11, M0135-H03, M0135-H10, M0105-C05, M0105-E11, M0105-F08, M0107-A12, M0108-A02, M0109-G11, M0110-G05, M0129-B11, M0130-A01, M0130-C12, M0130-F06, M0130-H04, M0131-A06, M0131-D03, M0132-A04, M0133-B08, M0133-E05, M0121-E07, M0118-F11, M0125-G07, M0124-E07, M0119-D01, M0119-A02, M0122-C06, M0123-G07, M0063-A02, M0063-A04, M0063-B01, M0063-B11, M0063-C07, M0063-G01, M0065-E12, M0065-G03, M0065-H05, M0067-A02, M0067-B06, M0067-B09, M0067-C10, M0067-F02, M0067-F06, M0069-A04, M0069-A11, M0069-C02, M0069-D10, M0069-G07, M0071-A01, M0071-B07, M0071-D05, M0071-D09, M0071-H03, M0071-H06, M0087-F09, M0088-F07, M0088-G10, M0088-H10, M0089-C01, M0089-F05, M0089-B07, M0089-H11, M0034-C04, M0039-F01, M0041-B05, M0041-G01, M0042-B06, M0006-B10, M0007-H06, M0008-H09, M0009-H08, M001-H11, M0015-F02, M0016-D01, M0013-D11, M0013-G12, M0013-H06, M0014-C09, M0014-G11, M0016-A11, M0016-H05, M0019-C05, M0020-B01, M0022-C07, M0025-D04 and M0027-E11.

In one embodiment, the linker is a peptide linker, e.g., a dipeptide linker, e.g., a val-cit linker or a phe-lys linker. In one embodiment, the cleavable linker is hydrolyzable at a pH of less than 5.5, e.g., the hydrolyzable linker is a hydrazone linker.

In some embodiments, the binding protein can be produced under GMP (good manufacturing practices). In some embodiments, the binding protein is provided in pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, e.g., suitable buffers or excipients.\n\n\nThe dose of a binding protein (e.g., a pharmaceutical composition containing a binding protein described herein) is sufficient to block about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about 99%, or about 100% of the activity of MMP-12 in the patient, e.g., at the site of disease. Depending on the disease, this may require a dose, e.g., of between about 0.01 mg/Kg to about 100 mg/Kg, e.g., between about 0.1 and about 10 mg/Kg. For example, the dose can be a dose of about 0.1, about 1, about 3, about 6, or about 10 mg/Kg. For example, for an IgG having a molecular mass of 150,000 g/mole (2 binding sites), these doses correspond to approximately 18 nM, 180 nM, 540 nM, 1.08 microM, and 1.8 microM, respectively, of binding sites for a 5 L blood volume.

The method includes: contacting the sample with an MMP-12 binding protein; and detecting an interaction between the protein and the MMP-12, if present. In some embodiments, the protein includes a detectable label. An MMP-12 binding protein can be used to detect MMP-12 in a subject. The method includes: administering an MMP-12 binding protein to a subject; and detecting the protein in the subject. In some embodiments, the protein further includes a detectable label. For example, the detecting comprises imaging the subject.

Other members of this group include interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) and stromelysin (MMP-3). MMP-12 (a.k.a. macrophage elastase, macrophage metalloelastase, or matrix metalloproteinase 12) is thought to be involved in many disease states. Many small molecule inhibitors of MMP-12 have been tested for safety and efficacy in cancer and other diseases. So far, all have lacked either sufficient potency or sufficient specificity or both. The present disclosure provides proteins that bind MMP-12, and in some instances, inhibit MMP-12 activity. In many instances, the disclosed MMP-12 binding proteins bind and inhibit human and mouse MMP12 enzyme activity. In other instances, MMP-12 binding proteins are disclosed that bind MMP-12 but do not inhibit MMP-12 activity. Such MMP-12 binding proteins are useful, e.g., to determine the presence of MMP-12.\n\n\nThe term “binding protein” refers to a protein that can interact with a target molecule. This term is used interchangeably with “ligand.” An “MMP-12 binding protein” refers to a protein that can interact with MMP-12, and includes, in particular, proteins that preferentially interact with and/or inhibit MMP-12. For example, the MMP-12 binding protein is an antibody.\n\n\nThe term “antibody” refers to a protein that includes at least one immunoglobulin variable domain or immunoglobulin variable domain sequence. For example, an antibody can include a heavy (H) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH), and a light (L) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL). In another example, an antibody includes two heavy (H) chain variable regions and two light (L) chain variable regions. The term “antibody” encompasses antigen-binding fragments of antibodies (e.g., single chain antibodies, Fab and sFab fragments, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fd fragments, Fv fragments, scFv, and domain antibodies (dAb) fragments (de Wildt et al., Eur J. Immunol. 1996; 26(3):629-39)) as well as complete antibodies. An antibody can have the structural features of IgA, IgG, IgE, IgD, IgM (as well as subtypes thereof). Antibodies may be from any source, but primate (human and non-human primate) and primatized are preferred\n\n\nThe VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed “complementarity determining regions” (“CDR”), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed “framework regions” (“FR”). The extent of the framework region and CDRs has been precisely defined (see, Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991) \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition\n, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242, and Chothia, C. et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917, see also www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk). Kabat definitions are used herein. Each VH and VL is typically composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4.\n\n\nAs used herein, an “immunoglobulin variable domain sequence” refers to an amino acid sequence which can form the structure of an immunoglobulin variable domain such that one or more CDR regions are positioned in a conformation suitable for an antigen binding site. For example, the sequence may include all or part of the amino acid sequence of a naturally-occurring variable domain. For example, the sequence may omit one, two or more N- or C-terminal amino acids, internal amino acids, may include one or more insertions or additional terminal amino acids, or may include other alterations. In one embodiment, a polypeptide that includes immunoglobulin variable domain sequence can associate with another immunoglobulin variable domain sequence to form an antigen binding site, e.g., a structure that preferentially interacts with an MMP-12 protein, e.g., the MMP-12 catalytic domain.\n\n\nThe VH or VL chain of the antibody can further include all or part of a heavy or light chain constant region, to thereby form a heavy or light immunoglobulin chain, respectively. In one embodiment, the antibody is a tetramer of two heavy immunoglobulin chains and two light immunoglobulin chains, wherein the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains are inter-connected by, e.g., disulfide bonds. In IgGs, the heavy chain constant region includes three immunoglobulin domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The light chain constant region includes a CL domain. The variable region of the heavy and light chains contains a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies typically mediate the binding of the antibody to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system. The light chains of the immunoglobulin may be of type kappa or lambda. In one embodiment, the antibody is glycosylated. An antibody can be functional for antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and/or complement-mediated cytotoxicity.\n\n\nOne or more regions of an antibody can be human or effectively human. For example, one or more of the variable regions can be human or effectively human. For example, one or more of the CDRs can be human, e.g., HC CDR1, HC CDR2, HC CDR3, LC CDR1, LC CDR2, and LC CDR3. Each of the light chain CDRs can be human. HC CDR3 can be human. One or more of the framework regions can be human, e.g., FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4 of the HC or LC. For example, the Fc region can be human. In one embodiment, all the framework regions are human, e.g., derived from a human somatic cell, e.g., a hematopoietic cell that produces immunoglobulins or a non-hematopoietic cell. In one embodiment, the human sequences are germline sequences, e.g., encoded by a germline nucleic acid. In one embodiment, the framework (FR) residues of a selected Fab can be converted to the amino-acid type of the corresponding residue in the most similar primate germline gene, especially the human germline gene. One or more of the constant regions can be human or effectively human. For example, at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 100% of an immunoglobulin variable domain, the constant region, the constant domains (CH1, CH2, CH3, CL1), or the entire antibody can be human or effectively human.\n\n\nAll or part of an antibody can be encoded by an immunoglobulin gene or a segment thereof. Exemplary human immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha (IgA1 and IgA2), gamma (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as the many immunoglobulin variable region genes. Full-length immunoglobulin “light chains” (about 25 KDa or about 214 amino acids) are encoded by a variable region gene at the NH\n2\n-terminus (about 110 amino acids) and a kappa or lambda constant region gene at the COOH— terminus. Full-length immunoglobulin “heavy chains” (about 50 KDa or about 446 amino acids), are similarly encoded by a variable region gene (about 116 amino acids) and one of the other aforementioned constant region genes, e.g., gamma (encoding about 330 amino acids). The length of human HC varies considerably because HC CDR3 varies from about 3 amino-acid residues to over 35 amino-acid residues.\n\n\nThe term “antigen-binding fragment” of a full length antibody refers to one or more fragments of a full-length antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to a target of interest. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term “antigen-binding fragment” of a full length antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment, a bivalent fragment including two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) \nNature \n341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR) that retains functionality. Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules known as single chain Fv (scFv). See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,260,203, 4,946,778, and 4,881,175; Bird et al. (1988) \nScience \n242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n85:5879-5883.\n\n\nAntibody fragments can be obtained using any appropriate technique including conventional techniques known to those with skill in the art. The term “monospecific antibody” refers to an antibody that displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular target, e.g., epitope. This term includes a “monoclonal antibody” or “monoclonal antibody composition,” which as used herein refer to a preparation of antibodies or fragments thereof of single molecular composition, irrespective of how the antibody was generated.\n\n\nAn “effectively human” immunoglobulin variable region is an immunoglobulin variable region that includes a sufficient number of human framework amino acid positions such that the immunoglobulin variable region does not elicit an immunogenic response in a normal human. An “effectively human” antibody is an antibody that includes a sufficient number of human amino acid positions such that the antibody does not elicit an immunogenic response in a normal human.\n\n\nA “humanized” immunoglobulin variable region is an immunoglobulin variable region that is modified to include a sufficient number of human framework amino acid positions such that the immunoglobulin variable region does not elicit an immunogenic response in a normal human. Descriptions of “humanized” immunoglobulins include, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,213 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762.\n\n\nAs used herein, “binding affinity” refers to the apparent association constant or K\na\n. The K\na \nis the reciprocal of the dissociation constant (K\nd\n). A binding protein may, for example, have a binding affinity of at least 10\n5\n, 10\n6\n, 10\n7\n, 10\n8\n, 10\n9\n, 10\n10 \nand 10\n11 \nM\n−1 \nfor a particular target molecule, e.g., MMP-9, MMP-16, or MMP-24. Higher affinity binding of a binding protein to a first target relative to a second target can be indicated by a higher K\na \n(or a smaller numerical value K\nd\n) for binding the first target than the K\na \n(or numerical value K\nd\n) for binding the second target. In such cases, the binding protein has specificity for the first target (e.g., a protein in a first conformation or mimic thereof) relative to the second target (e.g., the same protein in a second conformation or mimic thereof; or a second protein). Differences in binding affinity (e.g., for specificity or other comparisons) can be at least 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 37.5, 50, 70, 80, 91, 100, 500, 1000, or 10\n5 \nfold.\n\n\nBinding affinity can be determined by a variety of methods including equilibrium dialysis, equilibrium binding, gel filtration, ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, or spectroscopy (e.g., using a fluorescence assay). Exemplary conditions for evaluating binding affinity are in TRIS-buffer (50 mM TRIS, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl\n2 \nat pH7.5). These techniques can be used to measure the concentration of bound and free binding protein as a function of binding protein (or target) concentration. The concentration of bound binding protein ([Bound]) is related to the concentration of free binding protein ([Free]) and the concentration of binding sites for the binding protein on the target where (N) is the number of binding sites per target molecule by the following equation:\n\n\n[Bound]═N·[Free]/((1/Ka)+[Free]).\n\n\n\nIt is not always necessary to make an exact determination of K\na\n, though, since sometimes it is sufficient to obtain a quantitative measurement of affinity, e.g., determined using a method such as ELISA or FACS analysis, is proportional to K\na\n, and thus can be used for comparisons, such as determining whether a higher affinity is, e.g., 2-fold higher, to obtain a qualitative measurement of affinity, or to obtain an inference of affinity, e.g., by activity in a functional assay, e.g., an in vitro or in vivo assay.\n\n\nAn “isolated composition” refers to a composition (e.g., protein) that is removed from at least 90% of at least one component of a natural sample from which the isolated composition can be obtained. Compositions produced artificially or naturally can be “compositions of at least” a certain degree of purity if the species or population of species of interests is at least 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 80, 90, 92, 95, 98, or 99% pure on a weight-weight basis.\n\n\nAn “epitope” refers to the site on a target compound that is bound by a binding protein (e.g., an antibody such as a Fab or full length antibody). In the case where the target compound is a protein, the site can be entirely composed of amino acid components, entirely composed of chemical modifications of amino acids of the protein (e.g., glycosyl moieties), or composed of combinations thereof. Overlapping epitopes include at least one common amino acid residue, glycosyl group, phosphate group, sulfate group, or other molecular feature.\n\n\nCalculations of “homology” or “sequence identity” between two sequences (the terms are used interchangeably herein) are performed as follows. The sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). The optimal alignment is determined as the best score using the GAP program in the GCG software package with a Blossum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid “identity” is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid “homology”). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% of the length of the reference sequence. For example, the reference sequence may be the length of the immunoglobulin variable domain sequence.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “substantially identical” (or “substantially homologous”) is used herein to refer to a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence that contains a sufficient number of identical or equivalent (e.g., with a similar side chain, e.g., conserved amino acid substitutions) amino acid residues or nucleotides to a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence such that the first and second amino acid or nucleic acid sequences have (or encode proteins having) similar activities, e.g., a binding activity, a binding preference, or a biological activity. In the case of antibodies, the second antibody has the same specificity and has at least 50%, at least 25%, or at least 10% of the affinity relative to the same antigen.\n\n\nSequences similar or homologous (e.g., at least about 85% sequence identity) to the sequences disclosed herein are also part of this application. In some embodiments, the sequence identity can be about 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or higher. In addition, substantial identity exists when the nucleic acid segments hybridize under selective hybridization conditions (e.g., highly stringent hybridization conditions), to the complement of the strand. The nucleic acids may be present in whole cells, in a cell lysate, or in a partially purified or substantially pure form.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “hybridizes under low stringency, medium stringency, high stringency, or very high stringency conditions” describes conditions for hybridization and washing. Guidance for performing hybridization reactions can be found in \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6. Aqueous and nonaqueous methods are described in that reference and either can be used. Specific hybridization conditions referred to herein are as follows: (1) low stringency hybridization conditions in 6× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45° C., followed by two washes in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at least at 50° C. (the temperature of the washes can be increased to 55° C. for low stringency conditions); (2) medium stringency hybridization conditions in 6×SSC at about 45° C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60° C.; (3) high stringency hybridization conditions in 6×SSC at about 45° C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65° C.; and (4) very high stringency hybridization conditions are 0.5M sodium phosphate, 7% SDS at 65° C., followed by one or more washes at 0.2×SSC, 1% SDS at 65° C. Very high stringency conditions (4) are the preferred conditions and the ones that should be used unless otherwise specified. The disclosure includes nucleic acids that hybridize with low, medium, high, or very high stringency to a nucleic acid described herein or to a complement thereof, e.g., nucleic acids encoding a binding protein described herein. The nucleic acids can be the same length or within 30, 20, or 10% of the length of the reference nucleic acid. The nucleic acid can correspond to a region encoding an immunoglobulin variable domain sequence described herein.\n\n\nAn MMP-12 binding protein may have mutations (e.g., at least one, two, or four, and/or less than 15, 10, 5, or 3) relative to a binding protein described herein (e.g., conservative or non-essential amino acid substitutions), which do not have a substantial effect on protein function. Whether or not a particular substitution will be tolerated, i.e., will not adversely affect biological properties, such as binding activity can be predicted, e.g., by evaluating whether the mutation is conservative or by the method of Bowie, et al. (1990) \nScience \n247:1306-1310.\n\n\nA “conservative amino acid substitution” is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). It is possible for many framework and CDR amino acid residues to include one or more conservative substitutions.\n\n\nMotif sequences for biopolymers can include positions which can be varied amino acids. For example, the symbol “X” in such a context generally refers to any amino acid (e.g., any of the twenty natural amino acids or any of the nineteen non-cysteine amino acids). Other allowed amino acids can also be indicated for example, using parentheses and slashes. For example, “(A/W/FIN/Q)” means that alanine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, asparagine, and glutamine are allowed at that particular position.\n\n\nA “non-essential” amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence of the binding agent, e.g., the antibody, without abolishing or more preferably, without substantially altering a biological activity, whereas changing an “essential” amino acid residue results in a substantial loss of activity.\n\n\nThe term “cognate ligand” refers to a naturally occurring ligand of an MMP-12, including naturally occurring variants thereof (e.g., splice variants, naturally occurring mutants, and isoforms).\n\n\nStatistical significance can be determined by any art known method. Exemplary statistical tests include: the Students T-test, Mann Whitney U non-parametric test, and Wilcoxon non-parametric statistical test. Some statistically significant relationships have a P value of less than 0.05 or 0.02. Particular binding proteins may show a difference, e.g., in specificity or binding, that are statistically significant (e.g., P value <0.05 or 0.02). The terms “induce”, “inhibit”, “potentiate”, “elevate”, “increase”, “decrease” or the like, e.g., which denote distinguishable qualitative or quantitative differences between two states, and may refer to a difference, e.g., a statistically significant difference, between the two states.\n\n\nMMP-12 Binding Proteins\n\n\nThe disclosure provides proteins that bind to MMP-12 (e.g., human MMP-12 and/or murine MMP-12) and include at least one immunoglobin variable region. For example, the MMP-12 binding protein includes a heavy chain (HC) immunoglobulin variable domain sequence and a light chain (LC) immunoglobulin variable domain sequence. A number of exemplary MMP-12 binding proteins are described herein.\n\n\nThe MMP-12 binding protein may be an isolated protein (e.g., at least 70, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99% free of other proteins).\n\n\nThe MMP-12 binding protein may additionally inhibit MMP-12, e.g., human and/or murine MMP-12. The binding protein can inhibit the catalytic activity of MMP-12 (e.g., human MMP-12). In one embodiment, the protein binds the catalytic domain of human MMP-12, e.g., the protein contacts residues in or near the active site of MMP-12. In some embodiments, the protein does not contact residues in or near the active site of MMP-12 but instead binds elsewhere on MMP-12 and causes a steric change in MMP-12 that affects (e.g., inhibits) its activity.\n\n\nExemplary MMP-12 binding proteins include M0134-A02, M134-A05, M134-A07, M134-A09, M134-A10, M134-A 11, M0134-B01, M134-B04, M0134-B08, M0134-B 11, M0134-C01, M0134-C02, M0134-C06, M0134-C09, M0134-C10, M0134-C11, M0134-C12, M0134-D02, M0134-DO3, M0134-E04, M0134-E07, M0134-E08, M134-E11, M0134-F01, M0134-F05, M0134-G02, M0134-G04, M0134-G07, M0135-A03, M0135-A05, M0135-A06, M0135-A07, M0135-B02, M0135-B08, M0135-C01, M0135-C11, M0135-E03, M0135-F03, M0135-F11, M0135-G02, M0135-G03, M0135-G07, M0135-G11, M0135-H03, M0135-H10, M0105-C05, M0105-E11, M0105-F08, M0107-A12, M0108-A02, M0109-G11, M0110-G05, M0129-B11, M0130-A01, M0130-C12, M0130-F06, M0130-H04, M0131-A06, M0131-D03, M0132-A04, M0133-B08, M0133-E05, M0121-E07, M0118-F11, M0125-G07, M0124-E07, M0119-D01, M0119-A02, M0122-C06, M0123-G07, M0063-A02, M0063-A04, M0063-B01, M0063-B11, M0063-C07, M0063-G01, M0065-E12, M0065-G03, M0065-H05, M0067-A02, M0067-B06, M0067-B09, M0067-C10, M0067-F02, M0067-F06, M0069-A04, M0069-A11, M0069-C02, M0069-D10, M0069-G07, M0071-A01, M0071-B07, M0071-D05, M0071-D09, M0071-H03, M0071-H06, M0087-F09, M0088-F07, M0088-G10, M0088-H10, M0089-C01, M0089-F05, M0089-B07, M0089-H11, M0034-C04, M0039-F01, M0041-B05, M0041-G01, M0042-B06, M0006-B10, M0007-H06, M0008-H09, M0009-H08, M0011-H11, M0015-F02, M0016-D01, M0013-D11, M0013-G12, M0013-H06, M0014-C09, M0014-G11, M0016-A11, M0016-H05, M0019-C05, M0020-B01, M0022-C07, M0025-D04 and M0027-E11. Preferably, the MMP-12 binding protein is M0030-A10, M0008-H09, M0032-H09, M0038-A03, M0038-H04, M0039-B02, M0040-B05, M0041-A05, R011-B11, M0007-A10 (also referred to as M7A10) or M0008-E08 (also referred to as M8E8).\n\n\nMMP-12 binding proteins may be antibodies. MMP-12 binding antibodies may have their HC and LC variable domain sequences included in a single polypeptide (e.g., scFv), or on different polypeptides (e.g., IgG or Fab).\n\n\nMatrix Metalloproteinase 12 (MMP-12)\n\n\nMMP-12 Sequences. MMP-12 is encoded by a gene designated as MMP12 with full name Matrix metalloproteinase-12 precursor. Synonyms for MMP-12 include \nmatrix metalloproteinase\n 12, macrophage elastase, macrophage metalloelastase. The DNA sequence is known for \nHomo sapiens \nand \nMus musculus\n. An exemplary cDNA sequence encoding human MMP12 and the amino acid sequence are shown below. Exemplary cDNA sequences encoding murine MMP12 and amino acid sequences are also shown below. An exemplary MMP-12 protein can include the human or mouse MMP-12 amino acid sequence, a sequence that is 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to one of these sequences, or a fragment thereof, e.g., a fragment without the signal sequence or prodomain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncDNA and amino acid sequences of human MMP12\n\n\n

MMP-12 has a number of endogenous inhibitors. Like other MMPs, MMP-12 is inhibited by TIMPs (Murphy, G., and Willenbrock, F. (1995) \nMethods Enzymol. \n248, 496-510).\n\n\nSmall molecule inhibitors of MMP-12. Small molecule inhibitors of MMP-12 have been synthesized and tested.

(inhibitors with novel oxazoline zinc binding groups); and J Cardiovasc Pharmacol. 2004 July; 44(1):57-65. (ONO-4817). Other small molecule inhibitors of MMP-12 are described, e.g., in US Patent Application No: 20050014817 (Fluorothiophene derivatives), US Patent Application No.: 20050014816 (Thiophene amino acid derivatives), U.S. Pat. No. 6,770,640 (1-Carboxylmethyl-2-oxo-azepan derivatives), PCT Publication No.: WO200040577 (1-Carboxymethyl-2-Oxo-Azepan Derivatives), PCT Publication No.: WO 200532541 (Substituted Heterocyclic Mercaptosulfide Inhibitors), PCT Publication No.: WO 200183431, US Patent Application 20030158155, European Patent No.: 1288199, PCt Publication No.: WO 200040600 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,352,976, U.S. Pat. No. 6,350,907, U.S. Pat. No. 6,924,276, U.S. Pat. No. 6,916,807, U.S. Pat. No. 6,686,355, U.S. Pat. No. 6,548,477 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,506,242. The small molecule can be administered to inhibit MMP-12, e.g., in combination with a MMP-12 binding protein described herein.\n\n\nSmall interfering RNA inhibitors of MMP-12. MMP-12 can be inhibited by small interfering RNA (siRNA). Examples of siRNA that can be used are described in US Patent Publication No.: 20040087533 and PCt Publication No.: WO 200409098. The siRNA can be administered to inhibit MMP-12, e.g., in combination with a MMP-12 binding protein described herein.\n\n\nDrug Conjugates\n\n\nThe MMP-12 binding proteins described herein can be conjugated to a drug (e.g., a cytotoxic, cytostatic, or immunomodulatory agent). The conjugates can be used therapeutically or prophylactically, e.g., the binding protein can target the drug, e.g., in vivo, e.g., to a site of disease (e.g., a tumor or site of inflammation), e.g., such that the drug affects the site of disease (e.g., causes a cytostatic or cytotoxic effect on targeted cells).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the binding protein itself has therapeutic or prophylactic efficacy (e.g., the protein can modulate (e.g., antagonize) MMP-12, or cause a cytostatic or cytotoxic effect on a cell that expresses MMP-12 (e.g., an endothelial cell or tumor cell)). The binding protein-drug conjugate can be used such that the binding protein and drug both contribute (e.g., additively or synergistically) to an effect on MMP-12 (e.g., a therapeutic effect, e.g., in vivo, e.g., to a site of disease (e.g., a tumor or site of undesired angiogenesis or vascularization). The drug and/or binding protein can be, for example, cytotoxic, cytostatic or otherwise prevent or reduce the ability of a targeted cell to divide and/or survive (e.g., when the drug is taken up or internalized by the targeted cell and/or upon binding of the binding protein to MMP-12). For example, if the targeted cell is a cancer cell, the drug and/or binding protein can prevent or reduce the ability of the cell to divide and/or metastasize.\n\n\nUseful classes of drugs that can be used in the binding protein-drug conjugates described herein include cytotoxic or immunomodulatory agents such as, for example, antitubulin agents, auristatins, DNA minor groove binders, DNA replication inhibitors, alkylating agents (e.g., platinum complexes such as cis-platin, mono(platinum), bis(platinum) and tri-nuclear platinum complexes and carboplatin), anthracyclines, antibiotics, antifolates, antimetabolites, chemotherapy sensitizers, duocarmycins, etoposides, fluorinated pyrimidines, ionophores, lexitropsins, nitrosoureas, platinols, pre-forming compounds, purine antimetabolites, puromycins, radiation sensitizers, steroids, taxanes, topoisomerase inhibitors, vinca alkaloids, or the like.\n\n\nIndividual cytotoxic or immunomodulatory agents include, for example, an androgen, anthramycin (AMC), asparaginase, 5-azacytidine, azathioprine, bleomycin, busulfan, buthionine sulfoximine, camptothecin, carboplatin, carmustine (BSNU), CC-1065, chlorambucil, cisplatin, colchicine, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, cytidine arabinoside, cytochalasin B, dacarbazine, dactinomycin (actinomycin), daunorubicin, decarbazine, docetaxel, doxorubicin, an estrogen, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, 5-fluorouracil, gramicidin D, hydroxyurea, idarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, lomustine (CCNU), mechlorethamine, melphalan, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, mithramycin, mitomycin C, mitoxantrone, nitroimidazole, paclitaxel, plicamycin, procarbazine, rapamycin (Sirolimus), streptozotocin, tenoposide, 6-thioguanine, thioTEPA, topotecan, vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine, VP-16 and VM-26.\n\n\nIn some typical embodiments, the drug comprises a cytotoxic agent. Suitable cytotoxic agents include, for example, dolastatins (e.g., auristatin E, AFP, MMAF, MMAE), DNA minor groove binders (e.g., enediynes and lexitropsins), duocarmycins, taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel and docetaxel), puromycins, vinca alkaloids, CC-1065, SN-38, topotecan, morpholino-doxorubicin, rhizoxin, cyanomorpholino-doxorubicin, echinomycin, combretastatin, netropsin, epothilone A and B, estramustine, cryptophysins, cemadotin, maytansinoids, discodermolide, eleutherobin, and mitoxantrone.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the drug is a cytotoxic agent such as AFP, MMAF, MMAE, AEB, AEVB, auristatin E, paclitaxel, docetaxel, CC-1065, SN-38, topotecan, morpholino-doxorubicin, rhizoxin, cyanomorpholino-doxorubicin, dolastatin-10, echinomycin, combretatstatin, chalicheamicin, maytansine, DM-1, or netropsin.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the drug is a cytotoxic agent that comprises a conventional chemotherapeutic such as, for example, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, melphalan, vinca alkaloids, methotrexate, mitomycin C or etoposide. In some embodiments, the drug can be a combined therapy, such as CHOP (Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Prednisolone and Vincristine), CHOP-R (Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin Vincristine, Prednisolone, and rituximab) or ABVD (Doxorubicin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine and Dacarbazine). Agents such as CC-1065 analogues (e.g., DC1), calicheamicin, maytansine, analogues of \ndolastatin\n 10, rhizoxin, and palytoxin can also be used.\n\n\nIn specific embodiments, the drug can be a cytotoxic or cytostatic agent that comprises auristatin E (also known in the art as dolastatin-10) or a derivative thereof. Typically, the auristatin E derivative is, e.g., an ester formed between auristatin E and a keto acid. For example, auristatin E can be reacted with paraacetyl benzoic acid or benzoylvaleric acid to produce AEB and AEVB, respectively. Other auristatin derivatives include AFP, MMAF, and MMAE. The synthesis and structure of auristatin E and its derivatives are described in US 20030083263 and US 20050009751, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,323,315; 6,239,104; 6,034,065; 5,780,588; 5,665,860; 5,663,149; 5,635,483; 5,599,902; 5,554,725; 5,530,097; 5,521,284; 5,504,191; 5,410,024; 5,138,036; 5,076,973; 4,986,988; 4,978,744; 4,879,278; 4,816,444; and 4,486,414. In some preferred embodiments, MMAF or AFP is used.\n\n\nIn specific embodiments, the drug is a cytotoxic agent that comprises a DNA minor groove binding agent. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,130,237. For example, in some embodiments, the minor groove binding agent is a CBI compound. In other embodiments, the minor groove binding agent is an enediyne (e.g., calicheamicin).\n\n\nExamples of anti-tubulin agents that can be used in the MMP-12 binding protein-drug conjugates include, but are not limited to, taxanes (e.g., TAXOL® (paclitaxel), TAXOTERE® (docetaxel)), T67 (Tularik), vinca alkyloids (e.g., vincristine, vinblastine, vindesine, and vinorelbine), and dolastatins (e.g., auristatin E, AFP, MMAF, MMAE, AEB, AEVB). Other antitubulin agents include, for example, baccatin derivatives, taxane analogs (e.g., epothilone A and B), nocodazole, colchicine and colcimid, estramustine, cryptophysins, cemadotin, maytansinoids, combretastatins, discodermolide, eleutherobin, rhizoxin/maytansine, \nauristatin dolastatin\n 10 MMAE, and peloruside A.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the drug is a cytotoxic agent such as an anti-tubulin agent. In some embodiments, the anti-tubulin agent is an auristatin, a vinca alkaloid, a podophyllotoxin, a taxane, a baccatin derivative, a cryptophysin, a maytansinoid, a combretastatin, or a dolastatin. In some embodiments, the antitubulin agent is AFP, MMAP, MMAE, AEB, AEVB, auristatin E, vincristine, vinblastine, vindesine, vinorelbine, VP-16, camptothecin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, epothilone A, epothilone B, nocodazole, colchicines, colcimid, estramustine, cemadotin, discodermolide, maytansine, DM1, DM2, DM3, DM4, or eleutherobin.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the cytotoxic agent comprises a maytansinoid, another group of anti-tubulin agents. For example, in specific embodiments, the maytansinoid is maytansine or DM-1 (ImmunoGen, Inc.; see also Chari et al. \nCancer Res. \n52:127-131 (1992)).

In some embodiments, the binding protein is directly conjugated to the drug. Alternatively, the binding proteins described herein can be associated with a drug to form a binding protein-drug conjugate by use of a linker region between the drug and the binding protein. In some embodiments, the binding protein is conjugated to the drug via a linker. The linker can be cleavable under intracellular conditions, e.g., such that cleavage of the linker releases the drug from the binding protein in the intracellular environment. In some embodiments, the cleavable linker is a peptide linker cleavable by an intracellular protease. In some embodiments, the peptide linker is a dipeptide linker.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the dipeptide linker is a val-cit (vc) linker or a phe-lys (fk) linker. In some embodiments, the cleavable linker is hydrolyzable at a pH of less than 5.5. In some embodiments, the hydrolyzable linker is a hydrazone linker. In some embodiments, the cleavable linker is a disulfide linker.\n\n\nFor example, in some embodiments, the linker is cleavable by a cleaving agent that is present in the intracellular environment (e.g., within a lysosome or endosome or caveolea). The linker can be, e.g., a peptidyl linker that is cleaved by an intracellular peptidase or protease enzyme, including, but not limited to, a lysosomal or endosomal protease. In some embodiments, the peptidyl linker is at least two amino acids long or at least three amino acids long. Cleaving agents can include cathepsins B and D and plasmin, which are known to hydrolyze dipeptide drug derivatives resulting in the release of active drug inside target cells (see, e.g., Dubowchik and Walker \nPharm. Therapeutics \n83:67-123 (1999)). In some embodiments, peptidyl linkers are cleavable by enzymes that are present in targeted cells (e.g., cancer cells). For example, a peptidyl linker that is cleavable by the thiol-dependent protease cathepsin-B, which is highly expressed in cancerous tissue, can be used (e.g., a Phe-Leu or a Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly linker). Other such linkers are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,345. In some embodiments, the peptidyl linker cleavable by an intracellular protease is a Val-Cit (vc) linker or a Phe-Lys linker (fk) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,345, which describes the synthesis of doxorubicin with the val-cit linker). One advantage of using intracellular proteolytic release of the drug is that the drug can be attenuated when conjugated and the serum stabilities of the conjugates are typically high.\n\n\nIn some preferred embodiments, a vc linker is used in the binding protein-drug conjugates described herein. For example, a binding protein-vcAFP or a binding protein-vcMMAF conjugate (e.g., a MMP-12 binding protein-vcAFP or a MMP-12 binding protein-vcMMAF conjugate) is prepared.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the cleavable linker is pH-sensitive, i.e., sensitive to hydrolysis at certain pH values. For example, the pH-sensitive linker is hydrolyzable under acidic conditions. For example, an acid-labile linker that is hydrolyzable in the lysosome (e.g., a hydrazone, semicarbazone, thiosemicarbazone, cis-aconitic amide, orthoester, acetal., ketal., or the like) can be used. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,122,368; 5,824,805; 5,622,929; Dubowchik and Walker \nPharm. Therapeutics \n83:67-123 (1999); Neville et al. \nBiol. Chem. \n264:14653-14661 (1989). Such linkers are relatively stable under neutral pH conditions, such as those in the blood, but are unstable at below pH 5.5 or 5.0, the approximate pH of the lysosome. In certain embodiments, the hydrolyzable linker is a thioether linker (such as, e.g., a thioether attached to the therapeutic agent via an acylhydrazone bond (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,622,929)).\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the linker is cleavable under reducing conditions (e.g., a disulfide linker). A variety of disulfide linkers are known in the art, including, for example, those that can be formed using SATA (N-succinimidyl-5-acetylthioacetate), SPDP (N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate), SPDB (N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)butyrate) and SMPT (N-succinimidyl-oxycarbonyl-alpha-methyl-alpha-(2-pyridyl-dithio)toluene)-, SPDB and SMPT (See, e.g., Thorpe et al. \nCancer Res. \n47:5924-5931 (1987); Wawrzynczak et al., In Immunoconjugates: Antibody Conjugates in Radioimagery and Therapy of Cancer (C. W. Vogel ed., Oxford U. Press, 1987). See also U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,935.\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the linker is a malonate linker (Johnson et al. \nAnticancer Res. \n15:1387-93 (1995)), a maleimidobenzoyl linker (Lau et al. \nBioorg\n-\nMed\n-\nChem. \n3(10):1299-1304 (1995), or a 3′-N-amide analog (Lau et al. \nBioorg\n-\nMed\n-\nChem. \n3(10):1305-12 (1995)).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the linker is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment. As used herein, “not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment,” in the context of a linker, means that no more than about 20%, typically no more than about 15%, more typically no more than about 10%, and even more typically no more than about 5%, no more than about 3%, or no more than about 1% of the linkers, in a sample of a binding protein-drug conjugate, are cleaved when the binding protein-drug conjugate is present in an extracellular environment (e.g., in plasma). Whether a linker is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment can be determined, for example, by incubating independently with plasma both (a) the binding protein-drug conjugate (the “conjugate sample”) and (b) an equal molar amount of unconjugated binding protein or drug (the “control sample”) for a predetermined time period (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, or 24 hours) and then comparing the amount of unconjugated binding protein or drug present in the conjugate sample with that present in control sample, as measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.\n\n\nIn other, non-mutually exclusive embodiments, the linker promotes cellular internalization. In certain embodiments, the linker promotes cellular internalization when conjugated to the drug (i.e., in the milieu of the linker-drug moiety of the binding protein-drug conjugate described herein). In yet other embodiments, the linker promotes cellular internalization when conjugated to both the drug and the binding protein.\n\n\nA variety of linkers that can be used with the present compositions and methods are described in WO 2004010957.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the binding protein-drug conjugates described herein are used therapeutically in the treatment of a disorder (e.g., cancer or inflammation). In certain embodiments, it is desirable to only target a binding protein-drug conjugate to a cell that expresses the target to which the binding protein binds (e.g., to only target a MMP-12 expressing cell to which a MMP-12 binding protein binds, and not target a nearby “bystander” cell), e.g., to minimize toxicity. In other embodiments, it is desirable to target a binding protein-drug conjugate to a cell expressing the target to which the binding protein binds and also to bystander cells (e.g., to elicit a “bystander effect”). In some embodiments, a binding protein-drug conjugate (e.g., a MMP-12 binding protein-drug conjugate can be engineered to exert a precise killing of only antigen-presenting cells without damaging proximal antigen-negative tissues, e.g., by preparing thioether-linked conjugates. Alternatively, it can be engineered to produce a bystander effect, e.g., by preparing disulfide-linked conjugates.\n\n\nFor example, many solid tumors express targets (e.g., antigens) in a heterogeneous fashion and are populated with both target-positive and target-negative cells. The bystander cytotoxicity associated with disulfide linker-containing conjugates provides a rationale for treatment of sites of a disorder (e.g., tumors) with binding protein-drug conjugates even if the sites exhibit heterogeneous target expression. The bystander effect adds a degree of nonselective killing activity. Potentially, this could be a drawback if normal cells in tissues surrounding the site of disorder (e.g., tumor) are affected. However, as a potential advantage, the bystander cytotoxicity may damage tissues intricately involved in supporting the disorder, such as endothelial cells and pericytes of tumor neovasculature, or tumor stromal cells, resulting, for example, in enhanced antitumor activity of the binding protein-drug conjugate against tumors expressing the antigen either homogeneously or heterogeneously. See also Kovtum et al. \nCancer Res. \n66:3214 (2006).\n\n\nTechniques for conjugating therapeutic agents to proteins (such as binding proteins, e.g., MMP-12 binding proteins) are known. See, e.g., Amon et al., “Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer Therapy,” in Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy (Reisfeld et al eds., Alan R. Liss, Inc., 1985); Hellstrom et al., “Antibodies For Drug Delivery,” in Controlled Drug Delivery (Robinson et al. eds., Marcel Deiker, Inc., 2nd ed. 1987); Thorpe, “Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review,” in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological And Clinical Applications (Pinchera et al. eds., 1985); “Analysis, Results, and Future Prospective of the Therapeutic Use of Radiolabeled Antibody In Cancer Therapy,” in Monoclonal Antibodies For Cancer Detection And Therapy (Baldwin et al. eds., Academic Press, 1985); and Thorpe et al. \nImmunol. Rev. \n62:119-58 (1982). See also, e.g., US 2006-0233794 and PCT publication WO 89/12624.\n\n\nDisplay Libraries\n\n\nA display library is a collection of entities; each entity includes an accessible polypeptide component and a recoverable component that encodes or identifies the polypeptide component. The polypeptide component is varied so that different amino acid sequences are represented. The polypeptide component can be of any length, e.g. from three amino acids to over 300 amino acids. A display library entity can include more than one polypeptide component, for example, the two polypeptide chains of a sFab. In one exemplary implementation, a display library can be used to identify proteins that bind to MMP-12. In a selection, the polypeptide component of each member of the library is probed with MMP-12 (e.g., the catalytic domain of MMP-12 or other fragment) and if the polypeptide component binds to the MMP-12, the display library member is identified, typically by retention on a support.\n\n\nRetained display library members are recovered from the support and analyzed. The analysis can include amplification and a subsequent selection under similar or dissimilar conditions. For example, positive and negative selections can be alternated. The analysis can also include determining the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide component and purification of the polypeptide component for detailed characterization.\n\n\nA variety of formats can be used for display libraries. Examples include the following.\n\n\nPhage Display: The protein component is typically covalently linked to a bacteriophage coat protein. The linkage results from translation of a nucleic acid encoding the protein component fused to the coat protein. The linkage can include a flexible peptide linker, a protease site, or an amino acid incorporated as a result of suppression of a stop codon. Phage display is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; Smith (1985) \nScience \n228:1315-1317; WO 92/18619; WO 91/17271; WO 92/20791; WO 92/15679; WO 93/01288; WO 92/01047; WO 92/09690; WO 90/02809; de Haard et al. (1999) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n274:18218-30; Hoogenboom et al. (1998) \nImmunotechnology \n4:1-20; Hoogenboom et al. (2000) \nImmunol Today \n2:371-8 and Hoet et al. (2005) \nNat. Biotechnol. \n23(3)344-8. Bacteriophage displaying the protein component can be grown and harvested using standard phage preparatory methods, e.g. PEG precipitation from growth media. After selection of individual display phages, the nucleic acid encoding the selected protein components can be isolated from cells infected with the selected phages or from the phage themselves, after amplification. Individual colonies or plaques can be picked, the nucleic acid isolated and sequenced.\n\n\nOther Display Formats. Other display formats include cell based display (see, e.g., WO 03/029456), protein-nucleic acid fusions (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,446), ribosome display (See, e.g., Mattheakis et al. (1994) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n91:9022 and Hanes et al. (2000) \nNat. Biotechnol. \n18:1287-92; Hanes et al. (2000) \nMethods Enzymol. \n328:404-30; and Schaffitzel et al. (1999) \nJ Immunol Methods. \n231(1-2):119-35), and \nE. coli \nperiplasmic display (\nJ Immunol Methods. \n2005 Nov. 22; PMID: 16337958).\n\n\nScaffolds. Scaffolds useful for display include: antibodies (e.g., Fab fragments, single chain Fv molecules (scFV), single domain antibodies, camelid antibodies, and camelized antibodies); T-cell receptors; MHC proteins; extracellular domains (e.g., fibronectin Type III repeats, EGF repeats); protease inhibitors (e.g., Kunitz domains, ecotin, BPTI, and so forth); TPR repeats; trifoil structures; zinc finger domains; DNA-binding proteins; particularly monomeric DNA binding proteins; RNA binding proteins; enzymes, e.g., proteases (particularly inactivated proteases), RNase; chaperones, e.g., thioredoxin and heat shock proteins; intracellular signaling domains (such as SH2 and SH3 domains); linear and constrained peptides; and linear peptide substrates. Display libraries can include synthetic and/or natural diversity. See, e.g., US 2004-0005709.\n\n\nDisplay technology can also be used to obtain binding proteins (e.g., antibodies) that bind particular epitopes of a target. This can be done, for example, by using competing non-target molecules that lack the particular epitope or are mutated within the epitope, e.g., with alanine. Such non-target molecules can be used in a negative selection procedure as described below, as competing molecules when binding a display library to the target, or as a pre-elution agent, e.g., to capture in a wash solution dissociating display library members that are not specific to the target.\n\n\nIterative Selection. In one preferred embodiment, display library technology is used in an iterative mode. A first display library is used to identify one or more binding proteins for a target. These identified binding proteins are then varied using a mutagenesis method to form a second display library. Higher affinity binding proteins are then selected from the second library, e.g., by using higher stringency or more competitive binding and washing conditions.\n\n\nIn some implementations, the mutagenesis is targeted to regions at the binding interface. If, for example, the identified binding proteins are antibodies, then mutagenesis can be directed to the CDR regions of the heavy or light chains as described herein. Further, mutagenesis can be directed to framework regions near or adjacent to the CDRs. In the case of antibodies, mutagenesis can also be limited to one or a few of the CDRs, e.g., to make precise step-wise improvements. Exemplary mutagenesis techniques include: error-prone PCR, recombination, DNA shuffling, site-directed mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis.\n\n\nIn one example of iterative selection, the methods described herein are used to first identify a protein from a display library that binds MMP-12 with at least a minimal binding specificity for a target or a minimal activity, e.g., an equilibrium dissociation constant for binding of less than 1 nM, 10 nM, or 100 nM. The nucleic acid sequence encoding the initial identified proteins are used as a template nucleic acid for the introduction of variations, e.g., to identify a second protein that has enhanced properties (e.g., binding affinity, kinetics, or stability) relative to the initial protein.\n\n\nOff-Rate Selection. Since a slow dissociation rate can be predictive of high affinity, particularly with respect to interactions between polypeptides and their targets, the methods described herein can be used to isolate binding proteins with a desired (e.g., reduced) kinetic dissociation rate for a binding interaction to a target.\n\n\nTo select for slow dissociating binding proteins from a display library, the library is contacted to an immobilized target. The immobilized target is then washed with a first solution that removes non-specifically or weakly bound biomolecules. Then the bound binding proteins are eluted with a second solution that includes a saturating amount of free target or a target specific high-affinity competing monoclonal antibody, i.e., replicates of the target that are not attached to the particle. The free target binds to biomolecules that dissociate from the target. Rebinding is effectively prevented by the saturating amount of free target relative to the much lower concentration of immobilized target.\n\n\nThe second solution can have solution conditions that are substantially physiological or that are stringent. Typically, the solution conditions of the second solution are identical to the solution conditions of the first solution. Fractions of the second solution are collected in temporal order to distinguish early from late fractions. Later fractions include biomolecules that dissociate at a slower rate from the target than biomolecules in the early fractions.\n\n\nFurther, it is also possible to recover display library members that remain bound to the target even after extended incubation. These can either be dissociated using chaotropic conditions or can be amplified while attached to the target. For example, phage bound to the target can be contacted to bacterial cells.\n\n\nSelecting or Screening for Specificity. The display library screening methods described herein can include a selection or screening process that discards display library members that bind to a non-target molecule. Examples of non-target molecules include streptavidin on magnetic beads, blocking agents such as bovine serum albumin, non-fat bovine milk, any capturing or target immobilizing monoclonal antibody, or non-transfected cells which do not express the human MMP-12 target.\n\n\nIn one implementation, a so-called “negative selection” step is used to discriminate between the target and related non-target molecule and a related, but distinct non-target molecules. The display library or a pool thereof is contacted to the non-target molecule. Members of the sample that do not bind the non-target are collected and used in subsequent selections for binding to the target molecule or even for subsequent negative selections. The negative selection step can be prior to or after selecting library members that bind to the target molecule.\n\n\nIn another implementation, a screening step is used. After display library members are isolated for binding to the target molecule, each isolated library member is tested for its ability to bind to a non-target molecule (e.g., a non-target listed above). For example, a high-throughput ELISA screen can be used to obtain this data. The ELISA screen can also be used to obtain quantitative data for binding of each library member to the target as well as for cross species reactivity to related targets or subunits of the target (e.g., mouse MMP-12) and also under different condition such as pH6 or pH 7.5. The non-target and target binding data are compared (e.g., using a computer and software) to identify library members that specifically bind to the target.\n\n\nOther Exemplary Expression Libraries\n\n\nOther types of collections of proteins (e.g., expression libraries) can be used to identify proteins with a particular property (e.g., ability to bind MMP-12 and/or ability to modulate MMP-12), including, e.g., protein arrays of antibodies (see, e.g., De Wildt et al. (2000) Nat. Biotechnol. 18:989-994), lambda gt11 libraries, two-hybrid libraries and so forth.\n\n\nExemplary Libraries\n\n\nIt is possible to immunize a non-human primate and recover primate antibody genes that can be displayed on phage (see below). From such a library, one can select antibodies that bind the antigen used in immunization. See, for example, Vaccine. (2003) 22(2):257-67 or Immunogenetics. (2005) 57(10):730-8. Thus one could obtain primate antibodies that bind and inhibit MMP-9 by immunizing a chimpanzee or macaque and using a variety of means to select or screen for primate antibodies that bind and inhibit MMP-12. One can also make chimeras of primatized Fabs with human constant regions, see Curr Opin Mol Ther. (2004) 6(6):675-83. “PRIMATIZED antibodies, genetically engineered from cynomolgus macaque monkey and human components, are structurally indistinguishable from human antibodies. They may, therefore, be less likely to cause adverse reactions in humans, making them potentially suited for long-term, chronic treatment” Curr Opin Investig Drugs. (2001) 2(5):635-8.\n\n\nOne exemplary type of library presents a diverse pool of polypeptides, each of which includes an immunoglobulin domain, e.g., an immunoglobulin variable domain. Of interest are display libraries where the members of the library include primate or “primatized” (e.g., such as human, non-human primate or “humanized”) immunoglobin domains (e.g., immunoglobin variable domains) or chimeric primatized Fabs with human constant regions. Human or humanized immunoglobin domain libraries may be used to identify human or “humanized” antibodies that, for example, recognize human antigens. Because the constant and framework regions of the antibody are human, these antibodies may avoid themselves being recognized and targeted as antigens when administered to humans. The constant regions may also be optimized to recruit effector functions of the human immune system. The in vitro display selection process surmounts the inability of a normal human immune system to generate antibodies against self-antigens.\n\n\nA typical antibody display library displays a polypeptide that includes a VH domain and a VL domain. An “immunoglobulin domain” refers to a domain from the variable or constant domain of immunoglobulin molecules. Immunoglobulin domains typically contain two β-sheets formed of about seven β-strands, and a conserved disulphide bond (see, e.g., A. F. Williams and A. N. Barclay, 1988, \nAnn. Rev. Immunol. \n6:381-405). The display library can display the antibody as a Fab fragment (e.g., using two polypeptide chains) or a single chain Fv (e.g., using a single polypeptide chain). Other formats can also be used.\n\n\nAs in the case of the Fab and other formats, the displayed antibody can include one or more constant regions as part of a light and/or heavy chain. In one embodiment, each chain includes one constant region, e.g., as in the case of a Fab. In other embodiments, additional constant regions are displayed.\n\n\nAntibody libraries can be constructed by a number of processes (see, e.g., de Haard et al., 1999, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n274:18218-30; Hoogenboom et al., 1998, \nImmunotechnology \n4:1-20; Hoogenboom et al., 2000, \nImmunol. Today \n21:371-378, and Hoet et al. (2005) \nNat. Biotechnol. \n23(3)344-8. Further, elements of each process can be combined with those of other processes. The processes can be used such that variation is introduced into a single immunoglobulin domain (e.g., VH or VL) or into multiple immunoglobulin domains (e.g., VH and VL). The variation can be introduced into an immunoglobulin variable domain, e.g., in the region of one or more of CDR1, CDR2, CDR3, FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4, referring to such regions of either and both of heavy and light chain variable domains. The variation(s) may be introduced into all three CDRs of a given variable domain, or into CDR1 and CDR2, e.g., of a heavy chain variable domain. Any combination is feasible. In one process, antibody libraries are constructed by inserting diverse oligonucleotides that encode CDRs into the corresponding regions of the nucleic acid. The oligonucleotides can be synthesized using monomeric nucleotides or trinucleotides. For example, Knappik et al., 2000, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n296:57-86 describe a method for constructing CDR encoding oligonucleotides using trinucleotide synthesis and a template with engineered restriction sites for accepting the oligonucleotides.\n\n\nIn another process, an animal, e.g., a rodent, is immunized with MMP-12. The animal is optionally boosted with the antigen to further stimulate the response. Then spleen cells are isolated from the animal, and nucleic acid encoding VH and/or VL domains is amplified and cloned for expression in the display library.\n\n\nIn yet another process, antibody libraries are constructed from nucleic acid amplified from naïve germline immunoglobulin genes. The amplified nucleic acid includes nucleic acid encoding the VH and/or VL domain. Sources of immunoglobulin-encoding nucleic acids are described below. Amplification can include PCR, e.g., with primers that anneal to the conserved constant region, or another amplification method.\n\n\nNucleic acid encoding immunoglobulin domains can be obtained from the immune cells of, e.g., a primate (e.g., a human), mouse, rabbit, camel, or rodent. In one example, the cells are selected for a particular property. B cells at various stages of maturity can be selected. In another example, the B cells are naïve.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) is used to sort B cells that express surface-bound IgM, IgD, or IgG molecules. Further, B cells expressing different isotypes of IgG can be isolated. In another preferred embodiment, the B or T cell is cultured in vitro. The cells can be stimulated in vitro, e.g., by culturing with feeder cells or by adding mitogens or other modulatory reagents, such as antibodies to CD40, CD40 ligand or CD20, phorbol myristate acetate, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, or pokeweed mitogen.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the cells are isolated from a subject that has a disease of condition described herein, e.g., a cancer (e.g., metastatic cancer, e.g., metastatic breast cancer), an inflammatory disease (e.g., synovitis, atherosclerosis), rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, an ocular condition (e.g., macular degeneration), diabetes, Alzheimer's Disease, cerebral ischemia, endometriosis, fibrin-invasive activity, angiogenesis, or capillary tube formation In another embodiment, the cells are isolated from a transgenic non-human animal that includes a human immunoglobulin locus.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment, the cells have activated a program of somatic hypermutation. Cells can be stimulated to undergo somatic mutagenesis of immunoglobulin genes, for example, by treatment with anti-immunoglobulin, anti-CD40, and anti-CD38 antibodies (see, e.g., Bergthorsdottir et al., 2001, \nJ. Immunol. \n166:2228). In another embodiment, the cells are naïve.\n\n\nThe nucleic acid encoding an immunoglobulin variable domain can be isolated from a natural repertoire by the following exemplary method. First, RNA is isolated from the immune cell. Full length (i.e., capped) mRNAs are separated (e.g. by degrading uncapped RNAs with calf intestinal phosphatase). The cap is then removed with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase and reverse transcription is used to produce the cDNAs.\n\n\nThe reverse transcription of the first (antisense) strand can be done in any manner with any suitable primer. See, e.g., de Haard et al., 1999, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n274:18218-30. The primer binding region can be constant among different immunoglobulins, e.g., in order to reverse transcribe different isotypes of immunoglobulin. The primer binding region can also be specific to a particular isotype of immunoglobulin. Typically, the primer is specific for a region that is 3′ to a sequence encoding at least one CDR. In another embodiment, poly-dT primers may be used (and may be preferred for the heavy-chain genes).\n\n\nA synthetic sequence can be ligated to the 3′ end of the reverse transcribed strand. The synthetic sequence can be used as a primer binding site for binding of the forward primer during PCR amplification after reverse transcription. The use of the synthetic sequence can obviate the need to use a pool of different forward primers to fully capture the available diversity.\n\n\nThe variable domain-encoding gene is then amplified, e.g., using one or more rounds. If multiple rounds are used, nested primers can be used for increased fidelity. The amplified nucleic acid is then cloned into a display library vector.\n\n\nSecondary Screening Methods\n\n\nAfter selecting candidate library members that bind to a target, each candidate library member can be further analyzed, e.g., to further characterize its binding properties for the target, e.g., MMP-12, or for binding to other protein, e.g., another metalloproteinase. Each candidate library member can be subjected to one or more secondary screening assays. The assay can be for a binding property, a catalytic property, an inhibitory property, a physiological property (e.g., cytotoxicity, renal clearance, immunogenicity), a structural property (e.g., stability, conformation, oligomerization state) or another functional property. The same assay can be used repeatedly, but with varying conditions, e.g., to determine pH, ionic, or thermal sensitivities.\n\n\nAs appropriate, the assays can use a display library member directly, a recombinant polypeptide produced from the nucleic acid encoding the selected polypeptide, or a synthetic peptide synthesized based on the sequence of the selected polypeptide. In the case of selected Fabs, the Fabs can be evaluated or can be modified and produced as intact IgG proteins. Exemplary assays for binding properties include the following.\n\n\nELISA. Binding proteins can be evaluated using an ELISA assay. For example, each protein is contacted to a microtitre plate whose bottom surface has been coated with the target, e.g., a limiting amount of the target. The plate is washed with buffer to remove non-specifically bound polypeptides. Then the amount of the binding protein bound to the target on the plate is determined by probing the plate with an antibody that can recognize the binding protein, e.g., a tag or constant portion of the binding protein. The antibody is linked to a detection system (e.g., an enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase or horse radish peroxidase (HRP) which produces a colorimetric product when appropriate substrates are provided).\n\n\nHomogeneous Binding Assays. The ability of a binding protein described herein to bind a target can be analyzed using a homogenous assay, i.e., after all components of the assay are added, additional fluid manipulations are not required. For example, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) can be used as a homogenous assay (see, for example, Lakowicz et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,169; Stavrianopoulos, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,103). A fluorophore label on the first molecule (e.g., the molecule identified in the fraction) is selected such that its emitted fluorescent energy can be absorbed by a fluorescent label on a second molecule (e.g., the target) if the second molecule is in proximity to the first molecule. The fluorescent label on the second molecule fluoresces when it absorbs to the transferred energy. Since the efficiency of energy transfer between the labels is related to the distance separating the molecules, the spatial relationship between the molecules can be assessed. In a situation in which binding occurs between the molecules, the fluorescent emission of the ‘acceptor’ molecule label in the assay should be maximal. A binding event that is configured for monitoring by FRET can be conveniently measured through standard fluorometric detection means, e.g., using a fluorimeter. By titrating the amount of the first or second binding molecule, a binding curve can be generated to estimate the equilibrium binding constant.\n\n\nAnother example of a homogenous assay is ALPHASCREEN™ (Packard Bioscience, Meriden Conn.). ALPHASCREEN™ uses two labeled beads. One bead generates singlet oxygen when excited by a laser. The other bead generates a light signal when singlet oxygen diffuses from the first bead and collides with it. The signal is only generated when the two beads are in proximity. One bead can be attached to the display library member, the other to the target. Signals are measured to determine the extent of binding.\n\n\nSurface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The interaction of binding protein and a target can be analyzed using SPR. SPR or Biomolecular Interaction Analysis (BIA) detects biospecific interactions in real time, without labeling any of the interactants. Changes in the mass at the binding surface (indicative of a binding event) of the BIA chip result in alterations of the refractive index of light near the surface (the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR)). The changes in the refractivity generate a detectable signal, which are measured as an indication of real-time reactions between biological molecules. Methods for using SPR are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,640; Raether, 1988, Surface Plasmons Springer Verlag; Sjolander and Urbaniczky, 1991, \nAnal. Chem. \n63:2338-2345; Szabo et al., 1995, \nCurr. Opin. Struct. Biol. \n5:699-705 and on-line resources provide by BIAcore International AB (Uppsala, Sweden). BIAcore Flexchip can be used to compare and rank interactions in real time, in terms of kinetics, affinity or specificity without the use of labels.\n\n\nInformation from SPR can be used to provide an accurate and quantitative measure of the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n), and kinetic parameters, including K\non \nand K\noff\n, for the binding of a binding protein to a target. Such data can be used to compare different biomolecules. For example, selected proteins from an expression library can be compared to identify proteins that have high affinity for the target or that have a slow K\noff\n. This information can also be used to develop structure-activity relationships (SAR). For example, the kinetic and equilibrium binding parameters of matured versions of a parent protein can be compared to the parameters of the parent protein. Variant amino acids at given positions can be identified that correlate with particular binding parameters, e.g., high affinity and slow K\noff\n. This information can be combined with structural modeling (e.g., using homology modeling, energy minimization, or structure determination by x-ray crystallography or NMR). As a result, an understanding of the physical interaction between the protein and its target can be formulated and used to guide other design processes.\n\n\nCellular Assays. Binding proteins can be screened for ability to bind to cells which transiently or stably express and display the target of interest on the cell surface. For example, MMP-12 binding proteins can be fluorescently labeled and binding to MMP-12 in the presence of absence of antagonistic antibody can be detected by a change in fluorescence intensity using flow cytometry e.g., a FACS machine.\n\n\nOther Exemplary Methods for Obtaining MMP-12 Binding Antibodies\n\n\nIn addition to the use of display libraries, other methods can be used to obtain a MMP-12 binding antibody. For example, MMP-12 protein or a region thereof can be used as an antigen in a non-human animal, e.g., a rodent.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the non-human animal includes at least a part of a human immunoglobulin gene. For example, it is possible to engineer mouse strains deficient in mouse antibody production with large fragments of the human Ig loci. Using the hybridoma technology, antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) derived from the genes with the desired specificity may be produced and selected. See, e.g., XENOMOUSE™, Green et al., 1994, \nNat. Gen. \n7:13-21; U.S. 2003-0070185, WO 96/34096, published Oct. 31, 1996, and PCT Application No. PCT/US96/05928, filed Apr. 29, 1996.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a monoclonal antibody is obtained from the non-human animal, and then modified, e.g., humanized or deimmunized. Winter describes a CDR-grafting method that may be used to prepare the humanized antibodies (UK Patent Application GB 2188638A, filed on Mar. 26, 1987; U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539. All of the CDRs of a particular human antibody may be replaced with at least a portion of a non-human CDR or only some of the CDRs may be replaced with non-human CDRs. It is only necessary to replace the number of CDRs required for binding of the humanized antibody to a predetermined antigen.\n\n\nHumanized antibodies can be generated by replacing sequences of the Fv variable region that are not directly involved in antigen binding with equivalent sequences from human Fv variable regions. General methods for generating humanized antibodies are provided by Morrison, S. L., 1985, \nScience \n229:1202-1207, by Oi et al., 1986, \nBioTechniques \n4:214, and by Queen et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,585,089, U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,761 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762. Those methods include isolating, manipulating, and expressing the nucleic acid sequences that encode all or part of immunoglobulin Fv variable regions from at least one of a heavy or light chain. Numerous sources of such nucleic acid are available. For example, nucleic acids may be obtained from a hybridoma producing an antibody against a predetermined target, as described above. The recombinant DNA encoding the humanized antibody, or fragment thereof, can then be cloned into an appropriate expression vector.\n\n\nReducing Immunogenicity of MMP-12 Binding Proteins\n\n\nImmunoglobin MMP-12 binding proteins (e.g., IgG or Fab MMP-12 binding proteins) may be modified to reduce immunogenicity. Reduced immunogenicity is desirable in MMP-12 binding proteins intended for use as therapeutics, as it reduces the chance that the subject will develop an immune response against the therapeutic molecule. Techniques useful for reducing immunogenicity of MMP-12 binding proteins include deletion/modification of potential human T cell epitopes and ‘germlining’ of sequences outside of the CDRs (e.g., framework and Fc).\n\n\nAn MMP-12-binding antibody may be modified by specific deletion of human T cell epitopes or “deimmunization” by the methods disclosed in WO 98/52976 and WO 00/34317. Briefly, the heavy and light chain variable regions of an antibody are analyzed for peptides that bind to MHC Class II; these peptides represent potential T-cell epitopes (as defined in WO 98/52976 and WO 00/34317). For detection of potential T-cell epitopes, a computer modeling approach termed “peptide threading” can be applied, and in addition a database of human MHC class II binding peptides can be searched for motifs present in the VH and VL sequences, as described in WO 98/52976 and WO 00/34317. These motifs bind to any of the 18 major MHC class II DR allotypes, and thus constitute potential T cell epitopes. Potential T-cell epitopes detected can be eliminated by substituting small numbers of amino acid residues in the variable regions, or preferably, by single amino acid substitutions. As far as possible conservative substitutions are made, often but not exclusively, an amino acid common at this position in human germline antibody sequences may be used. Human germline sequences are disclosed in Tomlinson, I. A. et al., 1992, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227:776-798; Cook, G. P. et al., 1995, \nImmunol. Today \nVol. 16 (5): 237-242; Chothia, D. et al., 1992, \nJ. Mol. Bio. \n227:799-817. The V BASE directory provides a comprehensive directory of human immunoglobulin variable region sequences (compiled by Tomlinson, I. A. et al. MRC Centre for Protein Engineering, Cambridge, UK). After the deimmunizing changes are identified, nucleic acids encoding V\nH \nand V\nL \ncan be constructed by mutagenesis or other synthetic methods (e.g., de novo synthesis, cassette replacement, and so forth). Mutagenized variable sequence can, optionally, be fused to a human constant region, e.g., human IgG1 or κ constant regions.\n\n\nIn some cases a potential T cell epitope will include residues which are known or predicted to be important for antibody function. For example, potential T cell epitopes are usually biased towards the CDRs. In addition, potential T cell epitopes can occur in framework residues important for antibody structure and binding. Changes to eliminate these potential epitopes will in some cases require more scrutiny, e.g., by making and testing chains with and without the change. Where possible, potential T cell epitopes that overlap the CDRs were eliminated by substitutions outside the CDRs. In some cases, an alteration within a CDR is the only option, and thus variants with and without this substitution should be tested. In other cases, the substitution required to remove a potential T cell epitope is at a residue position within the framework that might be critical for antibody binding. In these cases, variants with and without this substitution should be tested. Thus, in some cases several variant deimmunized heavy and light chain variable regions were designed and various heavy/light chain combinations tested in order to identify the optimal deimmunized antibody. The choice of the final deimmunized antibody can then be made by considering the binding affinity of the different variants in conjunction with the extent of deimmunization, i.e., the number of potential T cell epitopes remaining in the variable region. Deimmunization can be used to modify any antibody, e.g., an antibody that includes a non-human sequence, e.g., a synthetic antibody, a murine antibody other non-human monoclonal antibody, or an antibody isolated from a display library.\n\n\nMMP-12 binding antibodies are “germlined” by reverting one or more non-germline amino acids in framework regions to corresponding germline amino acids of the antibody, so long as binding properties are substantially retained. Similar methods can also be used in the constant region, e.g., in constant immunoglobulin domains.\n\n\nAntibodies that bind to MMP-12, e.g., an antibody described herein, may be modified in order to make the variable regions of the antibody more similar to one or more germline sequences. For example, an antibody can include one, two, three, or more amino acid substitutions, e.g., in a framework, CDR, or constant region, to make it more similar to a reference germline sequence. One exemplary germlining method can include identifying one or more germline sequences that are similar (e.g., most similar in a particular database) to the sequence of the isolated antibody. Mutations (at the amino acid level) are then made in the isolated antibody, either incrementally or in combination with other mutations. For example, a nucleic acid library that includes sequences encoding some or all possible germline mutations is made. The mutated antibodies are then evaluated, e.g., to identify an antibody that has one or more additional germline residues relative to the isolated antibody and that is still useful (e.g., has a functional activity). In one embodiment, as many germline residues are introduced into an isolated antibody as possible.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, mutagenesis is used to substitute or insert one or more germline residues into a framework and/or constant region. For example, a germline framework and/or constant region residue can be from a germline sequence that is similar (e.g., most similar) to the non-variable region being modified. After mutagenesis, activity (e.g., binding or other functional activity) of the antibody can be evaluated to determine if the germline residue or residues are tolerated (i.e., do not abrogate activity). Similar mutagenesis can be performed in the framework regions.\n\n\nSelecting a germline sequence can be performed in different ways. For example, a germline sequence can be selected if it meets a predetermined criteria for selectivity or similarity, e.g., at least a certain percentage identity, e.g., at least 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 99.5% identity. The selection can be performed using at least 2, 3, 5, or 10 germline sequences. In the case of CDR1 and CDR2, identifying a similar germline sequence can include selecting one such sequence. In the case of CDR3, identifying a similar germline sequence can include selecting one such sequence, but may including using two germline sequences that separately contribute to the amino-terminal portion and the carboxy-terminal portion. In other implementations more than one or two germline sequences are used, e.g., to form a consensus sequence.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, with respect to a particular reference variable domain sequence, e.g., a sequence described herein, a related variable domain sequence has at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95 or 100% of the CDR amino acid positions that are not identical to residues in the reference CDR sequences, residues that are identical to residues at corresponding positions in a human germline sequence (i.e., an amino acid sequence encoded by a human germline nucleic acid).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, with respect to a particular reference variable domain sequence, e.g., a sequence described herein, a related variable domain sequence has at least 30, 50, 60, 70, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100% of the FR regions identical to FR sequence from a human germline sequence, e.g., a germline sequence related to the reference variable domain sequence.\n\n\nAccordingly, it is possible to isolate an antibody which has similar activity to a given antibody of interest, but is more similar to one or more germline sequences, particularly one or more human germline sequences. For example, an antibody can be at least 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 99.5% identical to a germline sequence in a region outside the CDRs (e.g., framework regions). Further, an antibody can include at least 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 germline residues in a CDR region, the germline residue being from a germline sequence of similar (e.g., most similar) to the variable region being modified. Germline sequences of primary interest are human germline sequences. The activity of the antibody (e.g., the binding activity as measured by K\nA\n) can be within a factor or 100, 10, 5, 2, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.001 of the original antibody.\n\n\nGermline sequences of human immunoglobin genes have been determined and are available from a number of sources, including the international ImMunoGeneTics Information System® (IMGT), available via the world wide web at imgt.cines.fr, and the V BASE directory (compiled by Tomlinson, I. A. et al. MRC Centre for Protein Engineering, Cambridge, UK, available via the world wide web at vbase.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk).\n\n\nExemplary germline reference sequences for V\nkappa \ninclude: O12/O2, O18/O8, A20, A30, L14, L1, L15, L4/18a, L5/L19, L8, L23, L9, L24, L11, L12, O11/O1, A17, A1, A18, A2, A19/A3, A23, A27, A11, L2/L16, L6, L20, L25, B3, B2, A26/A10, and A14. See, e.g., Tomlinson et al., 1995, \nEMBO J. \n14(18):4628-3.\n\n\nA germline reference sequence for the HC variable domain can be based on a sequence that has particular canonical structures, e.g., 1-3 structures in the H1 and H2 hypervariable loops. The canonical structures of hypervariable loops of an immunoglobulin variable domain can be inferred from its sequence, as described in Chothia et al., 1992, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227:799-817; Tomlinson et al., 1992, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227:776-798); and Tomlinson et al., 1995, \nEMBO J. \n14(18):4628-38. Exemplary sequences with a 1-3 structure include: DP-1, DP-8, DP-12, DP-2, DP-25, DP-15, DP-7, DP-4, DP-31, DP-32, DP-33, DP-35, DP-40, 7-2, hv3005, hv3005f3, DP-46, DP-47, DP-58, DP-49, DP-50, DP-51, DP-53, and DP-54.\n\n\nProtein Production\n\n\nStandard recombinant nucleic acid methods can be used to express a protein that binds to MMP-12. Generally, a nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein is cloned into a nucleic acid expression vector. Of course, if the protein includes multiple polypeptide chains, each chain can be cloned into an expression vector, e.g., the same or different vectors, that are expressed in the same or different cells.\n\n\nAntibody Production. Some antibodies, e.g., Fabs, can be produced in bacterial cells, e.g., \nE. coli \ncells. For example, if the Fab is encoded by sequences in a phage display vector that includes a suppressible stop codon between the display entity and a bacteriophage protein (or fragment thereof), the vector nucleic acid can be transferred into a bacterial cell that cannot suppress a stop codon. In this case, the Fab is not fused to the gene III protein and is secreted into the periplasm and/or media.\n\n\nAntibodies can also be produced in eukaryotic cells. In one embodiment, the antibodies (e.g., scFv's) are expressed in a yeast cell such as \nPichia \n(see, e.g., Powers et al., 2001, \nJ. Immunol. Methods. \n251:123-35), \nHanseula\n, or \nSaccharomyces. \n \n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment, antibodies are produced in mammalian cells. Preferred mammalian host cells for expressing the clone antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof include Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) (including dhfr-CHO cells, described in Urlaub and Chasin, 1980, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n77:4216-4220, used with a DHFR selectable marker, e.g., as described in Kaufman and Sharp, 1982, \nMol. Biol. \n159:601 621), lymphocytic cell lines, e.g., NS0 myeloma cells and SP2 cells, COS cells, HEK293T cells (\nJ. Immunol. Methods \n(2004) 289(1-2):65-80), and a cell from a transgenic animal, e.g., a transgenic mammal. For example, the cell is a mammary epithelial cell.\n\n\nIn addition to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the diversified immunoglobulin domain, the recombinant expression vectors may carry additional sequences, such as sequences that regulate replication of the vector in host cells (e.g., origins of replication) and selectable marker genes. The selectable marker gene facilitates selection of host cells into which the vector has been introduced (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,216, 4,634,665 and 5,179,017). For example, typically the selectable marker gene confers resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin or methotrexate, on a host cell into which the vector has been introduced. Preferred selectable marker genes include the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene (for use in dhfr\n−\n host cells with methotrexate selection/amplification) and the neo gene (for G418 selection).\n\n\nIn an exemplary system for recombinant expression of an antibody, or antigen-binding portion thereof, a recombinant expression vector encoding both the antibody heavy chain and the antibody light chain is introduced into dhfr\n−\n CRO cells by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection. Within the recombinant expression vector, the antibody heavy and light chain genes are each operatively linked to enhancer/promoter regulatory elements (e.g., derived from SV40, CMV, adenovirus and the like, such as a CMV enhancer/AdMLP promoter regulatory element or an SV40 enhancer/AdMLP promoter regulatory element) to drive high levels of transcription of the genes. The recombinant expression vector also carries a DHFR gene, which allows for selection of CHO cells that have been transfected with the vector using methotrexate selection/amplification. The selected transformant host cells are cultured to allow for expression of the antibody heavy and light chains and intact antibody is recovered from the culture medium. Standard molecular biology techniques are used to prepare the recombinant expression vector, transfect the host cells, select for transformants, culture the host cells and recover the antibody from the culture medium. For example, some antibodies can be isolated by affinity chromatography with a Protein A or Protein G coupled matrix.\n\n\nFor antibodies that include an Fc domain, the antibody production system may produce antibodies in which the Fc region is glycosylated. For example, the Fc domain of IgG molecules is glycosylated at asparagine 297 in the CH2 domain. This asparagine is the site for modification with biantennary-type oligosaccharides. It has been demonstrated that this glycosylation is required for effector functions mediated by Fcg receptors and complement Clq (Burton and Woof, 1992\n,Adv. Immunol. \n51:1-84; Jefferis et al., 1998, \nImmunol. Rev. \n163:59-76). In one embodiment, the Fc domain is produced in a mammalian expression system that appropriately glycosylates the residue corresponding to asparagine 297. The Fc domain can also include other eukaryotic post-translational modifications.\n\n\nAntibodies can also be produced by a transgenic animal. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,849,992 describes a method of expressing an antibody in the mammary gland of a transgenic mammal. A transgene is constructed that includes a milk-specific promoter and nucleic acids encoding the antibody of interest and a signal sequence for secretion. The milk produced by females of such transgenic mammals includes, secreted-therein, the antibody of interest. The antibody can be purified from the milk, or for some applications, used directly.\n\n\nCharacterization of MMP-12 Binding Proteins\n\n\nBinding of MMP-12 binding proteins to cells expressing MMP-12 can be characterized in a number assays known in the art, including FACS (Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting), ELISA, immunofluorescence, and immunocytochemistry. MMP-12 binding protein is contacted with cells and/or tissues which express or contain MMP-12, and binding is detected in accordance with the method being used. For example, a fluorescent detection system (e.g., fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody) employed for FACS and immunofluorescence analysis, or a enzymatic system is used for immunocytochemistry are generally used in these assays can be performed on non-perm. MMP-12 binding proteins can be characterized as to cellular binding by FACS (Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting) using cells expressing MMP-12. Individual cells held in a thin stream of fluid are passed through one or more laser beams cause light to scatter and fluorescent dyes to emit light at various frequencies. Photomultiplier tubes (PMT) convert light to electrical signals and cell data is collected. Forward and side scatter are used for preliminary identification of cells. Forward and side scatter are used to exclude debris and dead cells. Fluorescent labeling allows investigation of cell structure and function. Cell autofluorescence is generated by labeling cell structures with fluorescent dyes. FACS collects fluorescence signals in one to several channels corresponding to different laser excitation and fluorescence emission wavelength. Immunofluorescence, the most widely used application, involves the staining of cells with antibodies conjugated to fluorescent dyes such as fluorescein and phycoerythrin (PE). This method can be used to label MMP-12 on permeabilized cells, e.g., using biotinylated MMP-12 binding proteins. Biotin is used in this two-step detection systems in concert with conjugated steptavidin. Biotin is typically conjugated to proteins via primary amines (i.e., lysines). Usually, between 1.5 and 3 biotin molecules are conjugated to each antibody. A second fluorescently conjugated antibody (streptavidin/PE) is added which is specific for biotin.\n\n\nMMP-12 binding proteins can be characterized in cultured cells expressing the MMP-12 antigen. The method generally used is immunocytochemistry. Immunocytochemistry involves the use of antibodies that recognize parts of the protein that are exposed to the outside environment when expressed at the cell surface (the ‘primary antibody’) or that are accessible upon permeabilization of the cell. If the experiment is carried out in intact cells, such an antibody will only bind to surface expressed receptors. Biotinylated or non-biotinylated MMP-12 binding proteins can be used. The secondary antibody is then either a streptavidin/HRP antibody (for biotinylated MMP-12 binding protein) or an anti-human IgG/HRP (for non-biotinylated MMP-12 binding protein). The staining can then be detected using an inverted microscope. The assay can be performed in the absence of MMP-12 binding protein and in presence of 10 μg/mL of MMP-12 binding protein. Secreted MMP12 can be detected in samples of the medium in which MMP-12-expressing cells are cultured. For example, antibody based screening methods, e.g., using binding proteins described herein, can be used to detect secreted MMP-12. For example, immunoblot analysis or ELISA can be used.\n\n\nMMP-12 binding proteins can be characterized in assays that measure their modulatory activity toward MMP-12 or fragments thereof in vitro or in vivo. For example, MMP-12 can be combined with a substrate such as Mca-Pro-Leu-Ala-Cys(Mob)-Trp-Ala-Arg-Dap(Dnp)-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 6) under assay conditions permitting cleavage by MMP-12. The assay is performed in the absence of the MMP-12 binding protein, and in the presence of increasing concentrations of the MMP-12 binding protein. The concentration of binding protein at which 50% of the MMP-12 activity (e.g., binding to the substrate) is inhibited is the IC\n50 \nvalue (\nInhibitory Concentration\n 50%) or EC\n50 \n(\nEffective Concentration\n 50%) value for that binding protein. Within a series or group of binding proteins, those having lower IC\n50 \nor EC\n50 \nvalues are considered more potent inhibitors of MMP-12 than those binding proteins having higher IC\n50 \nor EC\n50 \nvalues. Exemplary binding proteins have an IC\n50 \nvalue of less than 800 nM, 400 nM, 100 nM, 25 nM, 5 nM, or 1 nM, e.g., as measured in an in vitro assay for inhibition of MMP-12 activity when the MMP-12 is at 2 pM.\n\n\nMMP-12 binding proteins may also be characterized with reference to the activity of MMP-12 on substrates (e.g., lung extracellular matrix, elastin, gelatin, etc.). For example, cleavage of gelatin by MMP-12 can be detected in zymography. The method is based on a SDS gel impregnated with a substrate, which is degraded by the proteases resolved during the incubation period. Coomassie blue staining of the gels reveals proteolytic fragments as white bands on a dark blue background. Within a certain range, the band intensity can be related linearly to the amount of the protease loaded. Cells expressing MMP-12 are used in this assay. The assay is performed in the absence of the MMP-12 binding protein, and in the presence of increasing concentrations of the MMP-12 binding protein. The concentration of binding protein at which 50% of the MMP-12 activity (e.g., binding to the substrate) is inhibited is the IC\n50 \nvalue (\nInhibitory Concentration\n 50%) or EC\n50 \n(\nEffective Concentration\n 50%) value for that binding protein. Within a series or group of binding proteins, those having lower IC\n50 \nor EC\n50 \nvalues are considered more potent inhibitors of MMP-12 than those binding proteins having higher IC\n50 \nor EC\n50 \nvalues. Exemplary binding proteins have an IC\n50 \nvalue of less than 800 nM, 400 nM, 100 nM, 25 nM, 5 nM, or 1 nM, e.g., as measured in an in vitro assay for inhibition of MMP-12 activity.\n\n\nThe binding proteins can also be evaluated for selectivity toward MMP-12. For example, a MMP-12 binding protein can be assayed for its potency toward MMP-12 and a panel of MMPs and other enzymes, e.g., human and/or mouse enzymes, e.g., MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -13, -14, -16, -17, -24, and TACE, and an IC\n50 \nvalue or EC\n50 \nvalue can be determined for each MMP. In one embodiment, a compound that demonstrates a low IC\n50 \nvalue or EC\n50 \nvalue for the MMP-12, and a higher IC\n50 \nvalue or EC\n50 \nvalue, e.g., at least 2-, 5-, or 10-fold higher, for another MMP within the test panel (e.g., MMP-1, -10) is considered to be selective toward MMP-12.\n\n\nMMP-12 binding proteins can be evaluated for their ability to inhibit MMP-12 in a cell based assay, e.g., in situ zymography, e.g., in Colo205 cells or MCF-7 cells.\n\n\nA pharmacokinetics study in rat, mice, or monkey can be performed with MMP-12 binding proteins for determining MMP-12 half-life in the serum. Likewise, the effect of the binding protein can be assessed in vivo, e.g., in an animal model for a disease, for use as a therapeutic, for example, to treat a disease or condition described herein, e.g., a cancer (e.g., metastatic cancer, e.g., metastatic colorectal, lung, or hepatocellular cancer), an inflammatory disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, rhinitis (e.g., allergic rhinitis), atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis), cardiovascular disease, aneurysym, wound healing, aging and nerve damage associated with excess or inappropriate activity of MMP-12.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nIn another aspect, the disclosure provides compositions, e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable compositions or pharmaceutical compositions, which include an MMP-12-binding protein, e.g., an antibody molecule, other polypeptide or peptide identified as binding to MMP-12 described herein. The MMP-12 binding protein can be formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutical compositions include therapeutic compositions and diagnostic compositions, e.g., compositions that include labeled MMP-12 binding proteins for in vivo imaging.\n\n\nA pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible. Preferably, the carrier is suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral, spinal, or epidermal administration (e.g., by injection or infusion), although carriers suitable for inhalation and intranasal administration are also contemplated. Depending on the route of administration, the MMP-12 binding protein may be coated in a material to protect the compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate the compound.\n\n\nA pharmaceutically acceptable salt is a salt that retains the desired biological activity of the parent compound and does not impart any undesired toxicological effects (see e.g., Berge, S. M., et al., 1977, \nJ. Pharm. Sci. \n66:1-19). Examples of such salts include acid addition salts and base addition salts. Acid addition salts include those derived from nontoxic inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphorous, and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, and the like. Base addition salts include those derived from alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic amines, such as N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, procaine, and the like.\n\n\nThe compositions may be in a variety of forms. These include, for example, liquid, semi-solid and solid dosage forms, such as liquid solutions (e.g., injectable and infusible solutions), dispersions or suspensions, tablets, pills, powders, liposomes and suppositories. The form can depend on the intended mode of administration and therapeutic application. Many compositions are in the form of injectable or infusible solutions, such as compositions similar to those used for administration of humans with antibodies. An exemplary mode of administration is parenteral (e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular). In one embodiment, the MMP-12 binding protein is administered by intravenous infusion or injection. In another preferred embodiment, the MMP-12 binding protein is administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.\n\n\nThe phrases “parenteral administration” and “administered parenterally” as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural and intrasternal injection and infusion.\n\n\nThe composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, dispersion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the binding protein in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The proper fluidity of a solution can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prolonged absorption of injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin.\n\n\nAn MMP-12 binding protein can be administered by a variety of methods, although for many applications, the preferred route/mode of administration is intravenous injection or infusion. For example, for therapeutic applications, the MMP-12 binding protein can be administered by intravenous infusion at a rate of less than 30, 20, 10, 5, or 1 mg/min to reach a dose of about 1 to 100 mg/m\n2 \nor 7 to 25 mg/m\n2\n. The route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results. In certain embodiments, the active compound may be prepared with a carrier that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are available. See, e.g., Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, J. R. Robinson, ed., 1978, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions can be administered with medical devices. For example, in one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein can be administered with a device, e.g., a needleless hypodermic injection device, a pump, or implant.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, an MMP-12 binding protein can be formulated to ensure proper distribution in vivo. For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) excludes many highly hydrophilic compounds. To ensure that the therapeutic compounds disclosed herein cross the BBB (if desired), they can be formulated, for example, in liposomes. For methods of manufacturing liposomes, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,522,811; 5,374,548; and 5,399,331. The liposomes may comprise one or more moieties that are selectively transported into specific cells or organs, thus enhance targeted drug delivery (see, e.g., V. V. Ranade, 1989, \nJ. Clin. Pharmacol. \n29:685).\n\n\nDosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms can be dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.\n\n\nAn exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of an antibody disclosed herein is 0.1-20 mg/kg, more preferably 1-10 mg/kg. An anti-MMP-12 antibody can be administered, e.g., by intravenous infusion, e.g., at a rate of less than 30, 20, 10, 5, or 1 mg/min to reach a dose of about 1 to 100 mg/m\n2 \nor about 5 to 30 mg/m\n2\n. For binding proteins smaller in molecular weight than an antibody, appropriate amounts can be proportionally less. Dosage values may vary with the type and severity of the condition to be alleviated. For a particular subject, specific dosage regimens can be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may include a “therapeutically effective amount” or a “prophylactically effective amount” of an MMP-12 binding protein disclosed herein. A “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result. A therapeutically effective amount of the composition may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the protein to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the composition is outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.\n\n\nA “therapeutically effective dosage” preferably modulates a measurable parameter, e.g., levels of circulating IgG antibodies or enzymatic activity, by a statistically significant degree or at least about 20%, more preferably by at least about 40%, even more preferably by at least about 60%, and still more preferably by at least about 80% relative to untreated subjects. The ability of a compound to modulate a measurable parameter, e.g., a disease-associated parameter, can be evaluated in an animal model system predictive of efficacy in human disorders and conditions, e.g., a cancer (e.g., metastatic cancer, e.g., metastatic colorectal, lung, or hepatocellular cancer), an inflammatory disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, rhinitis (e.g., allergic rhinitis), atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis), cardiovascular disease, aneurysym, wound healing, aging and nerve damage associated with excess or inappropriate activity of MMP-12. Alternatively, this property of a composition can be evaluated by examining the ability of the compound to modulate a parameter in vitro.\n\n\nA “prophylactically effective amount” refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically, because a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.\n\n\nStabilization and Retention\n\n\nIn one embodiment, an MMP-12 binding protein is physically associated with a moiety that improves its stabilization and/or retention in circulation, e.g., in blood, serum, lymph, or other tissues, e.g., by at least 1.5, 2, 5, 10, or 50 fold. For example, an MMP-12 binding protein can be associated with a polymer, e.g., a substantially non-antigenic polymer, such as polyalkylene oxides or polyethylene oxides. Suitable polymers will vary substantially by weight. Polymers having molecular number average weights ranging from about 200 to about 35,000 (or about 1,000 to about 15,000, and 2,000 to about 12,500) can be used. For example, an MMP-12 binding protein can be conjugated to a water soluble polymer, e.g., hydrophilic polyvinyl polymers, e.g. polyvinylalcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone. A non-limiting list of such polymers include polyalkylene oxide homopolymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polypropylene glycols, polyoxyethylenated polyols, copolymers thereof and block copolymers thereof, provided that the water solubility of the block copolymers is maintained.\n\n\nAn MMP-12 binding protein can also be associated with a carrier protein, e.g., a serum albumin, such as a human serum albumin. For example, a translational fusion can be used to associate the carrier protein with the MMP-12 binding protein.\n\n\nKits\n\n\nAn MMP-12 binding protein described herein can be provided in a kit, e.g., as a component of a kit. For example, the kit includes (a) an MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., a composition that includes an MMP-12 binding protein, and, optionally (b) informational material. The informational material can be descriptive, instructional, marketing or other material that relates to the methods described herein and/or the use of an MMP-12 binding protein for the methods described herein.\n\n\nThe informational material of the kits is not limited in its form. In one embodiment, the informational material can include information about production of the compound, molecular weight of the compound, concentration, date of expiration, batch or production site information, and so forth. In one embodiment, the informational material relates to using the binding protein to treat, prevent, or diagnosis of disorders and conditions, e.g., a cancer (e.g., metastatic cancer, e.g., metastatic colorectal, lung, or hepatocellular cancer), an inflammatory disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, rhinitis (e.g., allergic rhinitis), atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis), cardiovascular disease, aneurysym, wound healing, aging and nerve damage associated with excess or inappropriate activity of MMP-12.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the informational material can include instructions to administer an MMP-12 binding protein in a suitable manner to perform the methods described herein, e.g., in a suitable dose, dosage form, or mode of administration (e.g., a dose, dosage form, or mode of administration described herein). In another embodiment, the informational material can include instructions to administer an MMP-12 binding protein to a suitable subject, e.g., a human, e.g., a human having, or at risk for, a disorder or condition described herein, e.g., a cancer (e.g., metastatic cancer, e.g., metastatic colorectal, lung, or hepatocellular cancer), an inflammatory disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, rhinitis (e.g., allergic rhinitis), atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis), cardiovascular disease, aneurysym, wound healing, aging and nerve damage associated with excess or inappropriate activity of MMP-12. For example, the material can include instructions to administer an MMP-12 binding protein to a patient with a disorder or condition described herein, e.g., a cancer (e.g., metastatic cancer, e.g., metastatic colorectal, lung, or hepatocellular cancer), an inflammatory disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, rhinitis (e.g., allergic rhinitis), atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis), cardiovascular disease, aneurysym, wound healing, aging and nerve damage associated with excess or inappropriate activity of MMP-12. The informational material of the kits is not limited in its form. In many cases, the informational material, e.g., instructions, is provided in print but may also be in other formats, such as computer readable material.\n\n\nAn MMP-12 binding protein can be provided in any form, e.g., liquid, dried or lyophilized form. It is preferred that an MMP-12 binding protein be substantially pure and/or sterile. When an MMP-12 binding protein is provided in a liquid solution, the liquid solution preferably is an aqueous solution, with a sterile aqueous solution being preferred. When an MMP-9 binding protein is provided as a dried form, reconstitution generally is by the addition of a suitable solvent. The solvent, e.g., sterile water or buffer, can optionally be provided in the kit.\n\n\nThe kit can include one or more containers for the composition containing an MMP-12 binding protein. In some embodiments, the kit contains separate containers, dividers or compartments for the composition and informational material. For example, the composition can be contained in a bottle, vial, or syringe, and the informational material can be contained association with the container. In other embodiments, the separate elements of the kit are contained within a single, undivided container. For example, the composition is contained in a bottle, vial or syringe that has attached thereto the informational material in the form of a label. In some embodiments, the kit includes a plurality (e.g., a pack) of individual containers, each containing one or more unit dosage forms (e.g., a dosage form described herein) of an MMP-12 binding protein. For example, the kit includes a plurality of syringes, ampules, foil packets, or blister packs, each containing a single unit dose of an MMP-12 binding protein. The containers of the kits can be air tight, waterproof (e.g., impermeable to changes in moisture or evaporation), and/or light-tight.\n\n\nThe kit optionally includes a device suitable for administration of the composition, e.g., a syringe, inhalant, dropper (e.g., eye dropper), swab (e.g., a cotton swab or wooden swab), or any such delivery device. In one embodiment, the device is an implantable device that dispenses metered doses of the binding protein. The disclosure also features a method of providing a kit, e.g., by combining components described herein.\n\n\nTreatments\n\n\nProteins that bind to MMP-12 and identified by the method described herein and/or detailed herein have therapeutic and prophylactic utilities, particularly in human subjects. These binding proteins are administered to a subject to treat, prevent, and/or diagnose a variety of disorders, including e.g., a cancer (e.g., metastatic cancer, e.g., metastatic colorectal, lung, or hepatocellular cancer), an inflammatory disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, rhinitis (e.g., allergic rhinitis), atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis), cardiovascular disease, aneurysym, wound healing, aging and nerve damage associated with excess or inappropriate activity of MMP-12, or even to cells in culture, e.g. in vitro or ex vivo. Treating includes administering an amount effective to alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve or affect the disorder, the symptoms of the disorder or the predisposition toward the disorder. The treatment may also delay onset, e.g., prevent onset, or prevent deterioration of a disease or condition.\n\n\nExemplary disorders include a cancer (e.g., metastatic cancer, e.g., metastatic lung, colorectal or hepatocellular cancer), an inflammatory disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, rhinitis (e.g., allergic rhinitis), atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis), cardiovascular disease, aneurysym, wound healing, aging and nerve damage associated with excess or inappropriate activity of MMP-12. Some of these disorders are discussed above. Still other disorders that can be treated using an MMP-12 binding protein include: aortic aneurysms, dermal photoaging.\n\n\nAs used herein, an amount of an target-binding agent effective to prevent a disorder, or a prophylactically effective amount of the binding agent refers to an amount of a target binding agent, e.g., an MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 antibody described herein, which is effective, upon single- or multiple-dose administration to the subject, for preventing or delaying the occurrence of the onset or recurrence of a disorder, e.g., a disorder described herein.\n\n\nA binding agent described herein can be used to reduce angiogenesis in a subject, e.g., to treat a cancer (e.g., a solid tumor) or an angiogenesis-associated disorder. The method includes administering the binding to the subject, e.g., in an amount effective to modulate angiogenesis, a symptom of the disorder, or progression of the disorder. The agent (e.g., an MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 antibody) may be administered multiple times (e.g., at least two, three, five, or ten times) before a therapeutically effective amount is attained.\n\n\nMethods of administering MMP-12 binding proteins and other agents are also described in “Pharmaceutical Compositions.” Suitable dosages of the molecules used can depend on the age and weight of the subject and the particular drug used. The binding proteins can be used as competitive agents to inhibit, reduce an undesirable interaction, e.g., between a natural or pathological agent and the MMP-12. The dose of the MMP-12 binding protein can be the amount sufficient to block 90%, 95%, 99%, or 99.9% of the activity of MMP-12 in the patient, especially at the site of disease. Depending on the disease, this may require 0.1, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0, or 10.0 mg/Kg. For an IgG having a molecular mass of 150,000 g/mole (two binding sites), these doses correspond to approximately 18 nM, 180 nM, 540 nM, 1.08 μM, and 1.8 μM of binding sites for a 5 L blood volume.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the MMP-12 binding proteins are used to inhibit an activity (e.g., inhibit at least one activity of, reduce proliferation, migration, growth or viability) of a cell, e.g., a cancer cell in vivo. The binding proteins can be used by themselves or conjugated to an agent, e.g., a cytotoxic drug, cytotoxin enzyme, or radioisotope. This method includes: administering the binding protein alone or attached to an agent (e.g., a cytotoxic drug), to a subject requiring such treatment. For example, MMP-12 binding proteins that do not substantially inhibit MMP-12 may be used to deliver nanoparticles containing agents, such as toxins, to MMP-12 associated cells or tissues, e.g., tumors.\n\n\nBecause the MMP-12 binding proteins recognize MMP-12-expressing cells and can bind to cells that are associated with (e.g., in proximity of or intermingled with) cancer cells, e.g., cancerous lung, liver, colon, breast, ovarian, epidermal, laryngeal, and cartilage cells, and particularly metastatic cells thereof, MMP-12 binding proteins can be used to inhibit (e.g., inhibit at least one activity, reduce growth and proliferation, or kill) any such cells and inhibit carcinogenesis. Reducing MMP-12 activity near a cancer can indirectly inhibit (e.g., inhibit at least one activity, reduce growth and proliferation, or kill) the cancer cells which may be dependent on the MMP-12 activity for metastasis, activation of growth factors, and so forth.\n\n\nAlternatively, the binding proteins bind to cells in the vicinity of the cancerous cells, but are sufficiently close to the cancerous cells to directly or indirectly inhibit (e.g., inhibit at least one activity, reduce growth and proliferation, or kill) the cancers cells. Thus, the MMP-12 binding proteins (e.g., modified with a toxin, e.g., a cytotoxin) can be used to selectively inhibit cells in cancerous tissue (including the cancerous cells themselves and cells associated with or invading the cancer).\n\n\nThe binding proteins may be used to deliver an agent (e.g., any of a variety of cytotoxic and therapeutic drugs) to cells and tissues where MMP-12 is present. Exemplary agents include a compound emitting radiation, molecules of plants, fungal, or bacterial origin, biological proteins, and mixtures thereof. The cytotoxic drugs can be intracellularly acting cytotoxic drugs, such as toxins short range radiation emitters, e.g., short range, high energy α-emitters.\n\n\nTo target MMP-12 expressing cells, particularly cancerous cells, a prodrug system can be used. For example, a first binding protein is conjugated with a prodrug which is activated only when in close proximity with a prodrug activator. The prodrug activator is conjugated with a second binding protein, preferably one which binds to a non competing site on the target molecule. Whether two binding proteins bind to competing or non competing binding sites can be determined by conventional competitive binding assays. Exemplary drug prodrug pairs are described in Blakely et al., (1996) Cancer Research, 56:3287 3292.\n\n\nThe MMP-12 binding proteins can be used directly in vivo to eliminate antigen-expressing cells via natural complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The binding proteins described herein can include complement binding effector domain, such as the Fc portions from IgG1, -2, or -3 or corresponding portions of IgM which bind complement. In one embodiment, a population of target cells is ex vivo treated with a binding agent described herein and appropriate effector cells. The treatment can be supplemented by the addition of complement or serum containing complement. Further, phagocytosis of target cells coated with a binding protein described herein can be improved by binding of complement proteins. In another embodiment target, cells coated with the binding protein which includes a complement binding effector domain are lysed by complement.\n\n\nMethods of administering MMP-12 binding proteins are described in “Pharmaceutical Compositions.” Suitable dosages of the molecules used will depend on the age and weight of the subject and the particular drug used. The binding proteins can be used as competitive agents to inhibit or reduce an undesirable interaction, e.g., between a natural or pathological agent and the MMP-12.\n\n\nThe MMP-12 binding protein can be used to deliver macro and micromolecules, e.g., a gene into the cell for gene therapy purposes into the endothelium or epithelium and target only those tissues expressing the MMP-12. The binding proteins may be used to deliver a variety of cytotoxic drugs including therapeutic drugs, a compound emitting radiation, molecules of plants, fungal, or bacterial origin, biological proteins, and mixtures thereof. The cytotoxic drugs can be intracellularly acting cytotoxic drugs, such as short range radiation emitters, including, for example, short range, high energy a emitters, as described herein.\n\n\nIn the case of polypeptide toxins, recombinant nucleic acid techniques can be used to construct a nucleic acid that encodes the binding protein (e.g., antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof) and the cytotoxin (or a polypeptide component thereof) as translational fusions. The recombinant nucleic acid is then expressed, e.g., in cells and the encoded fusion polypeptide isolated.\n\n\nAlternatively, the MMP-12 binding protein can be coupled to high energy radiation emitters, for example, a radioisotope, such as \n131\nI, a γ-emitter, which, when localized at a site, results in a killing of several cell diameters. See, e.g., S.E. Order, “Analysis, Results, and Future Prospective of the Therapeutic Use of Radiolabeled Antibody in Cancer Therapy”, \nMonoclonal Antibodies for Cancer Detection and Therapy\n, R. W. Baldwin et al. (eds.), pp 303 316 (Academic Press 1985). Other suitable radioisotopes include a emitters, such as \n212\nBi, \n213\nBi, and \n211\nAt, and b emitters, such as \n186\nRe and \n90\nY. Moreover, \n177\nLu may also be used as both an imaging and cytotoxic agent.\n\n\nRadioimmunotherapy (RIT) using antibodies labeled with \n131\nI, \n90\nY, and \n177\nLu is under intense clinical investigation. There are significant differences in the physical characteristics of these three nuclides and as a result, the choice of radionuclide is very critical in order to deliver maximum radiation dose to a tissue of interest. The higher beta energy particles of \n90\nY may be good for bulky tumors. The relatively low energy beta particles of \n131\nI are ideal, but in vivo dehalogenation of radioiodinated molecules is a major disadvantage for internalizing antibody. In contrast, \n177\nLu has low energy beta particle with only 0.2-0.3 mm range and delivers much lower radiation dose to bone marrow compared to \n90\nY. In addition, due to longer physical half-life (compared to \n90\nY), the residence times are higher. As a result, higher activities (more mCi amounts) of \n177\nLu labeled agents can be administered with comparatively less radiation dose to marrow. There have been several clinical studies investigating the use of \n177\nLu labeled antibodies in the treatment of various cancers. (Mulligan T et al., 1995, \nClin. Canc. Res. \n1: 1447-1454; Meredith R F, et al., 1996, \nJ. Nucl. Med. \n37:1491-1496; Alvarez R D, et al., 1997, \nGynecol. Oncol. \n65: 94-101).\n\n\nExemplary Diseases and Conditions\n\n\nThe MMP-12 binding proteins described herein are useful to treat diseases or conditions in which MMP-12 is implicated, e.g., a disease or condition described herein, or to treat one or more symptoms associated therewith. In some embodiments, the MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., MMP-12 binding IgG or Fab) inhibits MMP-12 activity, e.g., catalytic activity.\n\n\nExamples of such diseases and conditions include a cancer (e.g., metastatic cancer, e.g., metastatic colorectal, lung, or hepatocellular cancer), an inflammatory disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, rhinitis (e.g., allergic rhinitis), atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis), cardiovascular disease, aneurysym, wound healing, aging and nerve damage associated with excess or inappropriate activity of MMP-12. A therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein is administered to a subject having or suspected of having a disorder in which MMP-12 is implicated, thereby treating (e.g., ameliorating or improving a symptom or feature of a disorder, slowing, stabilizing or halting disease progression) the disorder.\n\n\nThe MMP-12 binding protein is administered in a therapeutically effective amount. A therapeutically effective amount of an MMP-12 binding protein is the amount which is effective, upon single or multiple dose administration to a subject, in treating a subject, e.g., curing, alleviating, relieving or improving at least one symptom of a disorder in a subject to a degree beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment. A therapeutically effective amount of the composition may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the composition are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.\n\n\nA therapeutically effective amount can be administered, typically an amount of the compound which is effective, upon single or multiple dose administration to a subject, in treating a subject, e.g., curing, alleviating, relieving or improving at least one symptom of a disorder in a subject to a degree beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment. A therapeutically effective amount of the composition may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the composition are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A therapeutically effective dosage preferably modulates a measurable parameter, favorably, relative to untreated subjects. The ability of a compound to inhibit a measurable parameter can be evaluated in an animal model system predictive of efficacy in a human disorder.\n\n\nDosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.\n\n\nCancer\n\n\nMatrix metalloproteases (MMPs), such as MMP-12, are believed to contribute to cancer by cleaving components of the ECM and basement membranes, thereby allowing cancer cells to penetrate and infiltrate the subjacent stromal matrix. Additionally, a number of growth-factor receptors, cell adhesion molecules, chemokines, cytokines, apoptotic ligands, and angiogenic factors are substrates of MMPs. Hence, MMP activity may cause activation of growth factors, suppression of tumor cell apoptosis, destruction of chemokine gradients developed by host immune response, or release of angiogenic factors. MMPs may facilitate tumor growth by promoting the release of cell proliferation factors such as insulin-like growth factors which are bound to specific binding proteins (IGFBPs) (Manes et al., 1997 J. Biol. Chem. 272: 25706-25712).\n\n\nCollagenases, including MMP-12, have been found at elevated levels in cancers of the colon, lung, and liver. Usually, these elevated levels correlate with higher tumor grade and invasiveness.\n\n\nAccordingly, the disclosure provides methods of treating (e.g., slowing, eliminating, or reversing tumor growth, preventing or reducing, either in number or size, metastases, reducing or eliminating tumor cell invasiveness, providing an increased interval to tumor progression, or increasing disease-free survival time) cancer (e.g., breast cancer, including Her2+, Her2−, ER+, ER−, Her2+/ER+, Her2+/ER−, Her2−/ER+, and Her2−/ER− breast cancer), head and neck cancer, oral cavity cancer, laryngeal cancer, chondrosarcoma, ovarian cancer, lung cancer (e.g., non-small cell lung cancer), prostate cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer (hepatcellular cancer), cervical cancer, testicular carcinoma, melanoma, brain tumors (e.g., astrocytomas, glioblastomas, gliomas)) by administering an effective amount of an MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab). In some embodiments, the MMP-12 binding protein inhibits MMP-12 activity.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the MMP-12 binding protein is administered as a single agent treatment. In other embodiments, the MMP-12 binding protein is administered in combination with an additional anti-cancer agent.\n\n\nAlso provided are methods of preventing or reducing risk of developing cancer, by administering an effective amount of an MMP-12 binding protein to a subject at risk of developing cancer, thereby reducing the subject's risk of developing a cancer.\n\n\nThe disclosure further provides methods of modulating (e.g., reducing or preventing) angiogenesis at a tumor site by administering an effective amount of an MMP-12 binding protein, thereby reducing or preventing angiogenesis at the tumor site. The MMP-12 binding protein may be administered as a single agent therapy or in combination with additional agents.\n\n\nAlso provided are methods for reducing extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation by a tumor, comprising administering an effective amount of an MMP-12 binding protein to a subject, thereby reducing ECM degradation by a tumor in the subject.\n\n\nThe disclosed methods are useful in the prevention and treatment of solid tumors, soft tissue tumors, and metastases thereof. Solid tumors include malignancies (e.g., sarcomas, adenocarcinomas, and carcinomas) of the various organ systems, such as those of lung, breast, lymphoid, gastrointestinal (e.g., colon), and genitourinary (e.g., renal, urothelial, or testicular tumors) tracts, pharynx, prostate, and ovary. Exemplary adenocarcinomas include colorectal cancers, renal-cell carcinoma, liver cancer, non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, and cancer of the small intestine. Additional exemplary solid tumors include: fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, gastrointestinal system carcinomas, colon carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, genitourinary system carcinomas, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, endocrine system carcinomas, testicular tumor, lung carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and retinoblastoma. Metastases of the aforementioned cancers can also be treated or prevented in accordance with the methods described herein.\n\n\nGuidance for determination of a therapeutically effective amount for treatment of cancer may be obtained by reference to in vivo models of the cancer to be treated. For example, the amount of a MMP-12 binding protein that is a therapeutically effective amount in a rodent or Libechov minipig model of cancer may be used to guide the selection of a dose that is a therapeutically effective amount. A number of rodent models of human cancers are available, including nude mouse/tumor xenograft systems (e.g., melanoma xenografts; see, e.g., Trikha et al. Cancer Research 62:2824-2833 (2002)) and murine models of breast cancer or glioma (e.g., Kuperwasser et al., Cancer Research 65, 6130-6138, (2005); Bradford et al., Br J. Neurosurg. 3(2):197-210 (1989)). A melanoblastoma-bearing Libechov minipig (MeLiM) is available as an animal model of melanoma (e.g., Boisgard et al., Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 30(6):826-34 (2003)).\n\n\nRheumatoid Arthritis and Associated Conditions\n\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune, chronic inflammatory disease that causes joint swelling and pain and normally results in joint destruction. RA generally follows a relapsing/remitting course, with “flares” of disease activity interspersed with remissions of disease symptoms. RA is associated with a number of additional inflammatory disorders, including Sjogren's syndrome (dry eyes and mouth caused by inflammation of tear and saliva glands), pleuritis (inflammation of the pleura that causes pain upon deep breath and coughing), rheumatoid nodules (nodular sites of inflammation that develop within the lungs), pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium that causes pain when lying down or leaning forward), Felty syndrome (splenomegaly and leucopenia observed in conjunction with RA, making the subject prone to infection), and vasculitis (an inflammation of the blood vessels which can block blood flow). MMP-12 has been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nSymptoms of active RA include fatigue, lack of appetite, low grade fever, muscle and joint aches, and stiffness. Muscle and joint stiffness are usually most notable in the morning and after periods of inactivity. During flares, joints frequently become red, swollen, painful, and tender, generally as a consequence of synovitis.\n\n\nTreatment for rheumatoid arthritis involves a combination of medications, rest, joint strengthening exercises, and joint protection. Two classes of medications are used in treating rheumatoid arthritis: anti-inflammatory “first-line drugs,” and Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs).” The first-line drugs include NSAIDS (e.g., aspirin, naproxen, ibuprofen, and etodolac) and cortisone (corticosteroids). DMARDS, such as gold (e.g., gold salts, gold thioglucose, gold thiomalate, oral gold), methotrexate, sulfasalazine, D-penicillamine, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, and cyclosporine, leflunomide, etanercept, infliximab, anakinra, and adalimumab, and hydroxychloroquine, promote disease remission and prevent progressive joint destruction, but they are not anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n\nIncreased levels of MMP-12 have been found in subjects with arthritis (compared with normal individuals). The disclosure provides methods of treating (e.g., ameliorating, stabilizing, or eliminating one or more symptoms or ameliorating or stabilizing the subject's score on a RA scale) rheumatoid arthritis by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein to a subject having or suspected of having RA. Additionally provides are methods of treating RA by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein and at least one NSAID and/or DMARDS.\n\n\nFurther provided are methods of treating (e.g., ameliorating, stabilizing, or eliminating one or more symptoms) rheumatoid arthritis associated disorders (Sjogren's syndrome, pleuritis, pulmonary rheumatoid nodules, pericarditis, Felty syndrome, and vasculitis) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of an MMP-12 binding protein.\n\n\nScales useful for assessing RA and symptoms of RA include the Rheumatoid Arthritis Severity Scale (RASS; Bardwell et al., (2002) \nRheumatology \n41(1):38-45), SF-36 Arthritis Specific Health Index (ASHI; Ware et al., (1999) \nMed. Care. \n37(5 Suppl):MS40-50), Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales or Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales 2 (AIMS or AIMS2; Meenan et al. (1992) \nArthritis Rheum. \n35(1): 1-10); the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), HAQII, or modified HAQ (see, e.g., Pincus et al. (1983) \nArthritis Rheum. \n26(11):1346-53).\n\n\nGuidance for the determination of the dosage that delivers a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein may be obtained from animal models of rheumatoid arthritis, such as collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), which is induced, typically in rodents, by immunization with autologous or heterologous type II collagen in adjuvant (Williams et al. Methods Mol. Med. 98:207-16 (2004)).\n\n\nCOPD\n\n\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), also known as chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), is a group of diseases characterized by the pathological limitation of airflow in the airway that is not fully reversible. COPD is the umbrella term for chronic bronchitis, emphysema and a range of other lung disorders. It is most often due to tobacco smoking, but can be due to other airborne irritants such as coal dust, asbestos or solvents, as well as congenital conditions such as alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.\n\n\nThe main symptoms of COPD include dyspnea (shortness of breath) lasting for months or perhaps years, possibly accompanied by wheezing, and a persistent cough with sputum production. It is possible the sputum may contain blood (hemoptysis) and become thicker, usually due to damage of the blood vessels of the airways. Severe COPD could lead to cyanosis caused by a lack of oxygen in the blood. In extreme cases it could lead to cor pulmonale due to the extra work required by the heart to get blood to flow through the lungs.\n\n\nCOPD is particularly characterised by the spirometric measurement of a ratio of forced expiratory volume over 1 second (FEV\n1\n) to forced vital capacity (FVC) being <0.7 and the FEV\n1\n<80% of the predicted value as measured by a plethysmograph. Other signs include a rapid breathing rate (tachypnea) and a wheezing sound heard through a stethoscope. Pulmonary emphysema is NOT the same as subcutaneous emphysema, which is a collection of air under the skin that may be detected by the crepitus sounds produced on palpation.\n\n\nTreatment for COPD includes inhalers that dilate the airways (bronchodilators) and sometimes theophylline. The COPD patient must stop smoking. In some cases inhaled steroids are used to suppress lung inflammation, and, in severe cases or flare-ups, intravenous or oral steroids are given. Antibiotics are used during flare-ups of symptoms as infections can worsen COPD. Chronic, low-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, or intubation may be needed in some cases. Surgery to remove parts of the disease lung has been shown to be helpful for some patients with COPD. Lung rehabilitation programs may help some patients. Lung transplant is sometimes performed for severe cases. Bronchodilators that can be used include:\n\n\nThere are several types of bronchodilators used clinically with varying efficacy: for example, β\n2 \nagonists, M\n3 \nantimuscarinics, leukotriene antagonists, cromones, corticosteroids, and xanthines. These drugs relax the smooth muscles of the airway allowing for improved airflow. β\n2 \nagonists include: Salbutamol (VENTOLIN®), Bambuterol, Clenbuterol, Fenoterol, and Formoterol, and long acting β\n2 \nagonists (LABAs) such as Salmeterol. M\n3 \nmuscarinic antagonists (anticholinergics) include the quaternary M\n3 \nmuscarinic antagonist Ipratropium, which is widely prescribed with the β\n2 \nagonist salbutamol, Ipratropium, and Tiotropium, which can be combined with a LABA and inhaled steroid. Cromones include Cromoglicate and Nedocromil. Leukotriene antagonists can be used and include Montelukast, Pranlukast, Zafirlukast. Xanthines include theophylline, methylxanthines, theobromine. More aggressive EMR interventions include IV H\n1 \nantihistamines and IV dexamethasone. Phosphodiesterase-4 antagonists inlcude roflumilast and cilomilast. Corticosteroids can be used and include glucocorticoids, beclomethasone, mometasone, and fluticasone. Corticosteroids are often combined with bronchodilators in a single inhaler. Salmeterol and fluticasone can be combined (ADVAIR®). TNF antagonists include cachexin, cachectin infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept.\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating COPD (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of COPD) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having COPD. Also provided are methods of treating COPD by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another COPD treatment (e.g., β2 agonists, M\n3 \nantimuscarinics, leukotriene antagonists, cromones, corticosteroids, and xanthines).\n\n\nGuidance regarding the efficacy and dosage an MMP-12 binding protein which will deliver a therapeutically effective amount of the protein can be obtained from an animal model of COPD, see e.g., PCT publication WO 2007/084486 and references cited therein.\n\n\nEmphysema\n\n\nEmphysema is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), formerly termed a chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD). It is often caused by exposure to toxic chemicals or long-term exposure to tobacco smoke.\n\n\nEmphysema is caused by loss of elasticity (increased compliance) of the lung tissue, from destruction of structures supporting the alveoli, and destruction of capillaries feeding the alveoli, due to the action of \nalpha\n 1 antitrypsin deficiency. Thus the small airways collapse during exhalation, although alveolar collapsibility has increased. This impedes airflow and traps air in the lungs, as with other obstructive lung diseases. Symptoms include shortness of breath on exertion and later at rest, hyperventilation, and an expanded chest.\n\n\nSigns of emphysema include pursed-lipped breathing, central cyanosis and finger clubbing. The chest has increased percussion notes, particularly just above the liver, and a difficult to palpate apex beat, both due to hyperinflation. There may be decreased breath sounds and audible expiratory wheeze. In advanced disease, there are signs of fluid overload such as pitting peripheral edema. The face has a ruddy complexion if there is a secondary polycythemia. Sufferers who retain carbon dioxide have asterixis (metabolic flap) at the wrist.\n\n\nEmphysema is an irreversible degenerative condition. An important measure to slow its progression is for the patient to stop smoking and avoid all exposure to cigarette smoke and lung irritants. Pulmonary rehabilitation can be very helpful to optimize the patient's quality of life and teach the patient how to actively manage his or her care. Emphysema is also treated by supporting the breathing with anticholinergics, bronchodilators, steroid medication (inhaled or oral), and supplemental oxygen as required. Treating the patient's other conditions including gastric reflux and allergies can improve lung function. Supplemental oxygen used as prescribed (usually more than 20 hours per day) is the only non-surgical treatment which has been shown to prolong life in emphysema patients. Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) can improve the quality of life for certain carefully selected patients. Another treatment option is lung transplant, but few patients are strong enough physically to survive the surgery.\n\n\nCigarette smoke condensate induces MMP-12 gene expression in airway-like epithelia in mice (Lavigne et al. Biochem biophys Res Commun. 2005: 330:194). COPD patients produce greater quantities of MMP-12 than controls, which may be a critical step in the pathogenesis of emphysema (Molet et al. 2005: Inflamm Res. 2005: 54(1): 31). It has been shown that inflammatory lesions in the lungs of mice contain significantly more MMP-12 in macrophages at 10, 20, and 30 days than in controls of mice exposed to cigarette for 60 days (Valenca et al. Toxicol Pathol. 2004:32(3):351).\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating or preventing emphysema (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of emphysema) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having emphysema. Also provided are methods of treating emphysema by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another emphysema treatment (e.g., anticholinergics, bronchodilators, steroid medication, oxygen supplementation, lung volume reduction surgery or lung transplant).\n\n\nGuidance regarding the efficacy and dosage an MMP-12 binding protein which will deliver a therapeutically effective amount of the protein can be obtained from animal models of emphysema, see e.g., those described in Molet et al. 2005: Inflamm Res. 2005: 54(1): 31, Valenca et al. Toxicol Pathol. 2004:32(3):351, and references cited therein.\n\n\nAsthma\n\n\nAsthma is a chronic condition involving the respiratory system in which the airway occasionally constricts, becomes inflamed, and is lined with excessive amounts of mucus, often in response to one or more triggers. These episodes may be triggered by such things as exposure to an environmental stimulant (or allergen) such as cold air, warm air, moist air, exercise or exertion, or emotional stress. In children, the most common triggers are viral illnesses such as those that cause the common cold. This airway narrowing causes symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. The airway constriction responds to bronchodilators.\n\n\nIn some individuals asthma is characterized by chronic respiratory impairment. In others it is an intermittent illness marked by episodic symptoms that may result from a number of triggering events, including upper respiratory infection, stress, airborne allergens, air pollutants (such as smoke or traffic fumes), or exercise. Some or all of the following symptoms may be present in those with asthma: dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, coughing, an inability for physical exertion. Some asthmatics who have severe shortness of breath and tightening of the lungs never wheeze or have stridor and their symptoms may be confused with a COPD-type disease.\n\n\nAn acute exacerbation of asthma is commonly referred to as an asthma attack. The clinical hallmarks of an attack are shortness of breath (dyspnea) and either wheezing or stridor.\n\n\nDuring an asthma episode, inflamed airways react to environmental triggers such as smoke, dust, or pollen. The airways narrow and produce excess mucus, making it difficult to breathe. In essence, asthma is the result of an immune response in the bronchial airways.\n\n\nThe airways of asthmatics are “hypersensitive” to certain triggers/stimuli. In response to exposure to these triggers, the bronchi (large airways) contract into spasm (an “asthma attack”). Inflammation soon follows, leading to a further narrowing of the airways and excessive mucus production, which leads to coughing and other breathing difficulties.\n\n\nThe most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as pets or aspirin, and limiting or eliminating exposure to them. Desensitization is currently the only known “cure” to the disease.\n\n\nSymptomatic control of episodes of wheezing and shortness of breath is generally achieved with fast-acting bronchodilators.\n\n\nRelief medication: Short-acting, selective beta\n2\n-adrenoceptor agonists, such as salbutamol (albuterol USAN), levalbuterol, terbutaline and bitolterol, can be used. Older, less selective adrenergic agonists, such as inhaled epinephrine and ephedrine tablets, can be used. Anticholinergic medications, such as ipratropium bromide may be used.\n\n\nPreventative medication: Current treatment protocols recommend prevention medications such as an inhaled corticosteroid, which helps to suppress inflammation and reduces the swelling of the lining of the airways, in anyone who has frequent (greater than twice a week) need of relievers or who has severe symptoms. If symptoms persist, additional preventive drugs are added until the asthma is controlled. With the proper use of prevention drugs, asthmatics can avoid the complications that result from overuse of relief medications. Preventive agents include: inhaled glucocorticoids (e.g., ciclesonide, beclomethasone, budesonide, flunisolide, fluticasone, mometasone, and triamcinolone), leukotriene modifiers (e.g., montelukast, zafirlukast, pranlukast, and zileuton), mast cell stabilizers (e.g., cromoglicate (cromolyn), and nedocromil), antimuscarinics/anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium, oxitropium, and tiotropium), methylxanthines (e.g., theophylline and aminophylline), antihistamines, an IgE blocker such as omalizumab, methotrexate).\n\n\nLong-acting beta\n2\n-adrenoceptor agonists can be used and include salmeterol, formoterol, bambuterol, and sustained-release oral albuterol. Combinations of inhaled steroids and long-acting bronchodilators are becoming more widespread; the most common combination currently in use is fluticasone/salmeterol (Advair in the United States, and Seretide in the United Kingdom). Another combination is budesonide/formoterol which is commercially known as Symbicort.\n\n\nConcentrations of MMP-12 are increased in asthmatic subjects as compared with normal individuals. The disclosure provides methods of treating asthma (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of asthma) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having asthma. Also provided are methods of treating asthma by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another asthma treatment (e.g., glucocorticoids, leukotriene modifiers, mast cell stabilizers, antimuscarinics/anticholinergics, antihistamines, an IgE blocker, methotrexate.\n\n\nGuidance regarding the efficacy and dosage an MMP-12 binding protein which will deliver a therapeutically effective amount of the protein can be obtained from an animal model of asthma, see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,302, or European Pat. No. EP1192944 B1, and references cited therein.\n\n\nAtherosclerosis and Cardiovascular Disease\n\n\nAtherosclerosis is a disease affecting arterial blood vessels. It is a chronic inflammatory response in the walls of arteries, in large part due to the accumulation of macrophage white blood cells and promoted by low density (especially small particle) lipoproteins (plasma proteins that carry cholesterol and triglycerides) without adequate removal of fats and cholesterol from the macrophages by functional high density lipoproteins (HDL). It is caused by the formation of multiple plaques within the arteries.\n\n\nAtherosclerosis causes two main problems. First, the atheromatous plaques, though long compensated for by artery enlargement, eventually lead to plaque ruptures and stenosis (narrowing) of the artery and, therefore, an insufficient blood supply to the organ it feeds. If the compensating artery enlargement process is excessive, then an aneurysm results.\n\n\nCommonly, soft plaque suddenly ruptures, causing the formation of a thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow, leading to death of the tissues fed by the artery. This event is called an infarction. One commonly recognized scenario is called coronary thrombosis of a coronary artery, causing myocardial infarction (a heart attack). Another common scenario is claudication from insufficient blood supply to the legs, typically due to a combination of both stenosis and aneurysmal segments narrowed with clots. Since atherosclerosis is a body-wide process, similar events also occur in the arteries to the brain, intestines, kidneys, legs, etc.\n\n\nAtherosclerosis commonly becomes symptomatic when interfering with the coronary circulation supplying the heart or cerebral circulation supplying the brain, and is considered an underlying cause of strokes, heart attacks, various heart diseases including congestive heart failure, and most cardiovascular diseases, in general.\n\n\nIn human peripheral blood derived macrophages, MMP-12 mRNA is upregulated by several pro-atherosclerotic cytokines (Feinberg et al. J Biol. Chem. 2000: 275(33):25766). Transcript levels of MMP-12 in carotid atherosclerotic plaques correlate with histological features and clinical manisfestations (Morgan et al. Stroke. 2004: 35(6): 1310). MMP-12 mRNA was consistently demonstrated in atherosclerotic occlusive disease (AOD) tissues and may have a direct role in the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms (Curci et al. J Clin Invest. 1998:102(11):1900). Epidemiological data and in vivo animal experiments have indicated that differentiation of macrophages into potentially plaque-forming foam cells accompanied significantly elevated levels of matrix-degrading MMP-12 (Vogel et al. Cardiovasc Toxicol. 2004:4(4):363). MMP-12 has been shown to play an important role in vascular stenosis in hypercholesterolemia in hypercholesterolemic hamsters (Matsuno et al. 2004: 44(1): 57). Deficiency in MMP-12 protected apoliprotein E-deficient mice against atherosclerotic media destruction when MMP-12 deficiency mice were crossed in the atherosclerosis-prone apoliprotein E-deficient background and fed a cholesterol-rich diet (Lutten et al. 2004: 109(11): 1408).\n\n\nSmoking has been shown to be associated with increased macrophage immunoreactivity as well as elevated expression of MMP-12, which is a marker of inflammation and tissue destruction atherosclerotic plaques (Kangavari et al. J Cardiovasc Pharmacol Ther. 2004: 9(4):291). MMP-12 was detected in the lungs of rats treated with intraperitoneal nicotine and might play an important role in the development of cardiovascular and lung diseases in smokers (Valenca et al. Exp Toxicol Pathol. 2004: 55(5)393).\n\n\nTreatment for atherosclerosis includes statins, primary and secondary prevention, diet and dietary supplements, surgical intervention and prophylaxis.\n\n\nSome statins, e.g., rosuvastatin, have demonstrated regression of atherosclerotic plaque within the coronary arteries by IVUS (intravascular ultrasound evaluation). Combinations of statins, niacin, intestinal cholesterol absorption-inhibiting supplements (ezetimibe and others, and to a much lesser extent fibrates) have been a successful in changing common but sub-optimal lipoprotein patterns and group outcomes.\n\n\nIn addition, several classes of lipoprotein expression altering agents have consistently reduced not only heart attack, stroke and hospitalization but also mortality rates. Vitamin B3, AKA niacin, in pharmacologic doses, (generally 1,000 to 3,000 mg/day) tend to improve (a) HDL levels, size and function; (b) shift LDL particle distribution to larger particle size; and (c) lower lipoprotein (a), an atheroslerosis promoting genetic variant of LDL. The described MMP-12 binding proteins can be administered in combination with one or more of these treatments.\n\n\nOther treatments include minimally invasive angioplasty procedures that can include stents to physically expand narrowed arteries, and major invasive surgery, such as bypass surgery, to create additional blood supply connections that go around the more severely narrowed areas.\n\n\nPatients at risk for atherosclerosis-related diseases are increasingly being treated prophylactically with low-dose aspirin and a statin.\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating or preventing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Also provided are methods of treating atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease treatment (e.g., statins, primary and secondary prevention, diet and dietary supplements, surgical intervention or prophylaxis)\n\n\nGuidance regarding the efficacy and dosage an MMP-12 binding protein which will deliver a therapeutically effective amount of the protein can be obtained from animal models of atherosclerosis, see e.g., those described in Fan et al. Transgenic Res. 2004: 13(3): 261) and references cited therein.\n\n\nMultiple Sclerosis\n\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system (CNS), leading to demyelination. It may cause numerous physical and mental symptoms, and often progresses to physical and cognitive disability. Disease onset usually occurs in young adults, is more common in women.\n\n\nMS presents with a variety of symptoms, including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia); muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems in speech (dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia); visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or diplopia); fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes; and bladder and bowel difficulties. Cognitive impairment of varying degrees, or emotional symptomatology in the form of depression or pseudobulbar affect are also common. Neuropathic pain is usual, and this can be in the form of Lhermitte's sign. Paraesthesias can be present and include pins and needles; tingling; shivering; burning pains; feelings of pressure; and areas of skin with heightened sensitivity to touch. The pains associated with these can be aching, throbbing, stabbing, shooting, gnawing, tingling, tightness and numbness. The main clinical measure of disability progression and severity of the symptoms is the Expanded Disability Status Scale or EDSS.\n\n\nThe initial attacks (also known as exacerbations or relapses) are often transient, mild (or asymptomatic), and self-limited. The common initial symptoms reported are: changes in sensation in the arms, legs or face (33%), complete or partial vision loss (optic neuritis) (16%), weakness (13%), double vision (7%), unsteadiness when walking (5%), and balance problems (3%); but many rare initial symptoms have been reported such as aphasia or psychosis. Optic neuritis or focal leg weakness may lead to falls and other serious accidents.\n\n\nSeveral therapies have proven helpful for treatment of multiple sclerosis. The aims of treatment include returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. During symptomatic attacks administration of high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the routine therapy for acute relapses. Disease-modifying treatments including interferons (e.g., AVONEX®, REBIF®, BETAFERON®), glatiramer acetate (e.g., COPAXONE®), immunosuppressant (e.g., mitoxantrone) and natalizumab (e.g., TYSABRI®) are used for relapsing-remitting MS.\n\n\nIn human active demyelinating lesions, phagocytic macrophages are MMP-12 positive, suggesting a role for MMP-12 during demyelination in MS (Vos et al. J Neuroimmunol 2003: 138(1-2): 106).\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating or preventing MS (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of MS) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having MS. Also provided are methods of treating MS by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another MS treatment (e.g., interferons (e.g., AVONEX®, REBWF®, BETAFERON®), glatiramer acetate (e.g., COPAXONE®), immunosuppressant (e.g., mitoxantrone) and natalizumab (e.g., TYSABRI®)).\n\n\nGuidance regarding the efficacy and dosage an MMP-12 binding protein which will deliver a therapeutically effective amount of the protein can be obtained from animal models of MS, see e.g., those described in Toft-Hansen et al. J. Immunol. 2004: 173(8): 5209, Tsutsui et al. Neurosci 2004:24:1521, Anthony et al. J Neuroimmunol 1998: 87(1-2): 62 and references cited therein.\n\n\nAbdominal Aortic Aneurysm\n\n\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilatation of the abdominal aorta, that exceeds the normal diameter by more than 50%. The normal diameter of the infrarenal aorta is approximately 2 cm. It is caused by a degenerative process of the aortic wall, however the exact etiology remains unknown. It is most commonly located below the kidneys (infrarenally; 90%), other possible locations are above or at the level of the kidneys (suprarenal and pararenal). The aneurysm can extend to include one or both of the iliac arteries. An aortic aneurysm may also occur in the thorax.\n\n\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs more commonly in older individuals (between 65 and 75), and more often in men and smokers.\n\n\nA serious complication of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is rupture, which is often a fatal event. An abdominal aortic aneurysm weakens the walls of the blood vessel, leaving it vulnerable to rupturing. The clinical manifestation of ruptured AAA can include low back, flank, abdominal or groin pain, but the bleeding usually leads to a hypovolemic shock with hypotension, tachycardia, cyanosis, and altered mental status.\n\n\nSome risk factors for AAA include genetic influences, hemodynamic influences, atherosclerosis, infection, trauma, arteritis, cystic medial necrosis and connective tissue disorders (e.g. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome).\n\n\nMMP-12 zymogen levels and proteolytic activities are increased in AAAs when compared with healthy aorta, suggesting that chronic aortic wall inflammation is mediated by macrophage infiltration, which may account for the destruction of medial elastin (Annabi et al. J Vasc Surg. 2002: 35(3): 539). MMP-12 is prominently expressed by aneurysm-infiltrating macrophages within the degenerating aortic media of AAA, where it is also bound to residual elastic fiber fragments. Because elastin represents a critical component of aortic wall structure and a matrix substrate for metalloelastases, MMP-12 may have a direct role in the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms (Curci et al. 1998: 102(11): 1900).\n\n\nThe treatment options for asymptomatic AAA are immediate repair, surveillance with a view to eventual repair, and conservative management. There are currently two modes of repair available for an AAA: open aneurysm repair (OR), and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating or preventing AAA (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of AAA) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having AAA. Also provided are methods of treating AAA by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another AAA treatment (e.g., immediate repair, surveillance with a view to eventual repair, or conservative management).\n\n\nGuidance regarding the efficacy and dosage an MMP-12 binding protein which will deliver a therapeutically effective amount of the protein can be obtained from animal models of AAA, see e.g., those described in Longo et al. Surgery. 2005: 137(4): 457, Shimizu et al. J Clin Invest. 2004: 114(2): 300 and references cited therein.\n\n\nSclerosis\n\n\nSystemic sclerosis (SSc) is the generalized type of scleroderma, which is a chronic disease characterized by excessive deposits of collagen in the skin or other organs. SSc can be fatal as a result of heart, kidney, lung or intestinal damage autoimmune disease.\n\n\nScleroderma affects the skin, and in more serious cases it can affect the blood vessels and internal organs. The more evident symptom is usually the hardening of the skin and associated scarring. Blood vessels may also be more visible. Many SSc patients (over 80%) have vascular symptoms and Raynaud's phenomenon. During an attack, there is discoloration of the hands and feet in response to cold. Raynaud's normally affects the fingers and toes. SSc and Raynaud's can cause painful ulcers on the fingers or toes which are known as digital ulcers. Calcinosis is also common in SSc, and is often seen near the elbows, knees or other joints. Diffuse scleroderma can cause musculoskeletal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal and other complications. Patients with larger amounts of cutaneous involvement are more likely to have involvement of the internal tissues and organs.\n\n\nThere appears to be a familial predisposition for autoimmune disease.\n\n\nOverproduction of MMP-12 by SSc microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) has been shown to account for the cleavage of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and the impairment of angiogenesis in vitro and may contribute to reduced angiogenesis in SSc patients (D'Alessio et al. Arthritis Rheum. 2004: 50(10): 3275).\n\n\nTreatment for some of the symptoms of scleroderma includes drugs that soften the skin and reduce inflammation. Topical treatment for the skin changes of scleroderma do not alter the disease course, but may improve pain and ulceration. A range of NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can be used to ease painful symptoms, such as naproxen. Episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon sometimes respond to nifedipine or other calcium channel blockers; severe digital ulceration may respond to prostacyclin analogue iloprost, and the dual endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan may be beneficial for Raynaud's phenomenon. The skin tightness may be treated systemically with methotrexate and cyclosporin. Scleroderma renal crisis, the occurrence of acute renal failure and malignant hypertension (very high blood pressure with evidence of organ damage) in people with scleroderma, is effectively treated with drugs from the class of the ACE inhibitors. Active alveolitis is often treated with pulses of cyclophosphamide, often together with a small dose of steroids. Pulmonary hypertension may be treated with epoprostenol, bosentan and possibly aerolized iloprost.\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating or preventing SSc (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of SSc) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having SSc. Also provided are methods of treating SSc by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another SSc treatment (e.g., NSAIDs, calcium channel blockers, prostacyclin analogue, the dual endothelin-receptor antagonist, methotrexate, cyclosporin, ACE inhibitors, cyclophosphamide, epoprostenol, and bosentan).\n\n\nNephritis\n\n\nNephritis is inflammation of the kidney and is often caused by infections, toxins, and auto-immune diseases. Subtypes include glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis or tubulo-interstitial nephritis, pyelonephritis and Lupus nephritis.\n\n\nNephritis is a common cause of glomerular injury. It is a disturbance of the glomerular structure with inflammatory cell proliferation. This can lead to: reduced glomerular blood flow leading to reduced urine output (oliguria) and retention of waste products (uremia). As a result, there can also be leakage of red blood cells from damaged glomerulus (hematuria). Low renal blood flow activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which therefore causes fluid retention and mild hypertension.\n\n\nMMP-12 is one of the highly expressed genes in the kidneys on \n \ndays\n \n 3 and 7 after the injection of anti-GBM (glomerular basement membrane) antiserum in a Rat crescentic glomerulonephritis model (Kaneko et al. J. Immunol. 2003: 170(6): 3373).\n\n\nAs a subset of nephritis, e.g. pyelonephritis, are often due to bacterial infections, antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment.\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating or preventing nephritis (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of nephritis) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having nephritis. Also provided are methods of treating nephritis by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another nephritis treatment (e.g. antibiotics).\n\n\nGuidance regarding the efficacy and dosage an MMP-12 binding protein which will deliver a therapeutically effective amount of the protein can be obtained from animal models of nephritis, see e.g., those described in Kaneko et al. J. Immunol. 2003: 170(6): 3373, and references cited therein.\n\n\nWound Healing\n\n\nWound healing, or wound repair, is the process of regenerating dermal and epidermal tissue. When an individual is wounded, a set of complex biochemical events takes place in a closely orchestrated cascade to repair the damage. These events overlap in time and may be artificially categorized into separate steps: the inflammatory, proliferative, and remodeling phases.\n\n\nBy regulating the proliferation of corneal epithelial cells, MMP-12 appears to contribute to corneal wound healing (Lyu et al. J Biol. Chem. 2005: 280(22): 21653). Epithelial expression of MMP-12 in chronic wounds provides a diagnostic clue for distinguishing squamous cell carcinoma (SCCs) from nonmalignant wounds (Impola et al. Br J. Dermatol. 2005: 152(4): 720).\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating wound (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of wound) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having wound. Also provided are methods of treating wound by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another wound treatment.\n\n\nEncephalomyelitis and Neuroinflammatory Disorders\n\n\nEncephalomyelitis, e.g., experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, sometimes Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis (EAE), is an animal model of brain inflammation. It is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). It is often used with rodents and is widely studied as an animal model of the human CNS demyelinating diseases, including the diseases multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. EAE can be induced by inoculation with whole CNS tissue, purified myelin basic protein (MBP) or myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), together with adjuvants. It may also be induced by the passive transfer of T cells specifically reactive to these myelin antigens. EAE may have either an acute or a chronic relapsing course. Acute EAE closely resembles the human disease acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, while chronic relapsing EAE resembles multiple sclerosis. EAE is also the prototype for T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease in general.\n\n\nMMP-12 is overexpressed in spinal cord from SJL/J mice and mice with adoptively transferred myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific EAE (Toft-Hansen et al. J. Immunol. 2004: 173(8): 5209). In human, aberrant expression of MMP-12 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated neuroinflammatory disorders (Hughes et al. Neuroscience. 2002: 113(2):273).\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating or preventing encephalomyelitis, e.g., EAE, and neuroinflammatory disorders (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of encephalomyelitis and neuroinflammatory disorders) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having EAE and neuroinflammatory disorders. Also provided are methods of treating encephalomyelitis and neuroinflammatory disorders by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another nephritis treatment.\n\n\nGuidance regarding the efficacy and dosage an MMP-12 binding protein which will deliver a therapeutically effective amount of the protein can be obtained from animal models of encephalomyelitis and neuroinflammatory disorders, see e.g., those described in Toft-Hansen et al. J. Immunol. 2004: 173(8): 5209, and references cited therein.\n\n\nAging\n\n\nIn biology, senescence is the state or process of aging. Cellular senescence is a phenomenon where isolated cells demonstrate a limited ability to divide in culture, while organismal senescence is the aging of organisms.\n\n\nOrganismal senescence is characterized by the declining ability to respond to stress, increasing homeostatic imbalance and increased risk of disease. As genes that have an effect on aging are discovered, aging is increasingly being regarded in a similar fashion to other genetic conditions.\n\n\nIn humans and other animals, cellular senescence has been attributed to the shortening of telomeres with each cell cycle; when telomeres become too short, the cells die. Other genes are known to affect the aging process, the sirtuin family of genes have been shown to have a significant effect on the lifespan of yeast and nematodes. Over-expression of the RAS2 gene increases lifespan in yeast substantially. In addition to genetic ties to lifespan, diet has been shown to substantially affect lifespan in many animals.\n\n\nThe level of MMP-12 increases in the insoluble fraction of old mice, suggesting increased extracellular matrix (ECM) degradative capacity and MMP-12 may contribute to age-dependent ECM remodeling (Lindsey et al. Cardiovasc Res. 2005: 66(2):410.) Heat treatment increases MMP-12 mRNA and protein expression in human skin suggesting that MMP-12 may contribute to skin aging by accumulation of elastotic material in photoaged skin (Chen et al. J Invest Dermatol. 2005: 124(1):70). MMP-12 may also contribute to skin aging by remodeling of elastotic areas in sun-damaged skin (Saarialho-Kere et al. J Invest Dermatol. 1999: 113(4):664).\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating or preventing aging (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of aging e.g. skin aging) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having aging (e.g. skin aging). Also provided are methods of treating aging by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another aging treatment.\n\n\nViral Encephalitis\n\n\nViral encephalitis is an acute inflammation of the brain caused by a viral infection. Brain damage occurs as the inflamed brain pushes against the skull, and can lead to death.\n\n\nPatients with encephalitis suffer from fever, headache and photophobia with weakness and seizures also common. Less commonly, stiffness of the neck can occur with rare cases of patients also suffering from stiffness of the limbs, slowness in movement and clumsiness depending on which specific part of the brain is involved. The symptoms of encephalitis are caused by the brain's defense mechanisms activating to get rid of the infection.\n\n\nTreatment is usually symptomatic. Reliably tested specific antiviral agents are available only for a few viral agents (e.g. acyclovir for herpes simplex virus). In patients who are very sick, supportive treatment, such as mechanical ventilation, is also important.\n\n\nInfection of the murine central nervous system (CNS) with a neurotropic coronavirus induces encephalitis associated with increased levels of mRNA encoding MMP-12 (Zhou et al. J. Virol. 2005: 79(8):4764).\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating or preventing viral encephalitis (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of viral encephalitis) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having viral encephalitis. Also provided are methods of treating viral encephalitis by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another viral encephalitis treatment (e.g., acyclovir, mechanical ventilation).\n\n\nGuidance regarding the efficacy and dosage an MMP-12 binding protein which will deliver a therapeutically effective amount of the protein can be obtained from animal models of viral encephalitis, see e.g., those described in Zhou et al. J. Virol. 2005: 79(8):4764, and references cited therein.\n\n\nStroke\n\n\nStroke is the rapidly developing loss of brain functions due to a disturbance in the blood vessels supplying blood to the brain. This can be due to ischemia (lack of blood supply) caused by thrombosis or embolism, or due to a hemorrhage. In an ischemic stroke, blood supply to part of the brain is decreased, leading to dysfunction and necrosis of the brain tissue in that area. Intracranial hemorrhage is the accumulation of blood anywhere within the skull vault. A distinction is made between intra-axial hemorrhage (blood inside the brain) and extra-axial hemorrhage (blood inside the skull but outside the brain). Intra-axial hemorrhage is due to intraparenchymal hemorrhage or intraventricular hemorrhage (blood in the ventricular system). The main types of extra-axial hemorrhage are epidural hematoma (bleeding between the dura mater and the skull), subdural hematoma (in the subdural space) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (between the arachnoid mater and pia mater). Most of the hemorrhagic stroke syndromes have specific symptoms (e.g. headache, previous head injury).\n\n\nStroke symptoms typically develop rapidly (seconds to minutes). The symptoms of a stroke are related to the anatomical location of the damage; nature and severity of the symptoms can therefore vary widely. Ischemic strokes usually only affect regional areas of the brain perfused by the blocked artery. Hemorrhagic strokes can affect local areas, but often can also cause more global symptoms due to bleeding and increased intracranial pressure.\n\n\nIn mice MMP-12 expression following haemorrhagic stroke is deleterious and contributes to the development of secondary injury in this disease (Wells et al. Eur J. Neurosci. 2005: 21(1):187). Transcript level of MMP-12 in carotid atherosclerotic plaques is correlated with histological features and clinical manifestations, supporting a role of MMP-12 in determining atherosclerotic plaque stability (Morgan et al. Stroke. 2001: 32(9):2198).\n\n\nTreatment for stroke includes pharmacologic thrombolysis (“clot busting”) with the drug tissue plasminogen activator, tPA, to dissolve the clot and unblock the artery. Another treatment for acute ischemic stroke is removal of the offending thrombus directly. This is accomplished by inserting a catheter into the femoral artery, directing it into the cerebral circulation, and deploying a corkscrew-like device to ensnare the clot, which is then withdrawn from the body. Anticoagulation can prevent recurrent stroke. Patients with bleeding into (intracerebral hemorrhage) or around the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage), require neurosurgical evaluation to detect and treat the cause of the bleeding.\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating or preventing stroke (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of stroke) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having stroke. Also provided are methods of treating stroke by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another stroke treatment (e.g., thrombolysis, plasminogen activator, anticoagulation or surgical procedures).\n\n\nGuidance regarding the efficacy and dosage an MMP-12 binding protein which will deliver a therapeutically effective amount of the protein can be obtained from animal models of stroke, see e.g., those described in Wells et al. Eur J. Neurosci. 2005: 21(1):187), and references cited therein.\n\n\nEnterocolitis\n\n\nEnterocolitis (or “coloenteritis”) is an inflammation of both the small and large intestine. Enteritis is the inflammation of the small intestine and colitis is inflammation of the large intestine, especially the colon.\n\n\nSymptoms for enteritis may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, abdominal distension and hematochezia. General signs and symptoms of colitis include pain, tenderness in the abdomen, depression, rapid weight loss, aches and pains within the joints, fatigue, changes in bowel habits (increased frequency), fever; swelling of the colon tissue, erythema (redness) of the surface of the colon, ulcers on the colon (in ulcerative colitis) which can bleed, mucous in the stool, blood in stool and rectal bleeding. Other symptoms may include: diarrhea, gas, bloating, indigestion, heartburn, reflux, Gastro oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), cramps, urgency and many other uncomfortable aches in the gastrointestinal system.\n\n\nMMP-12 is up-regulated in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), suggesting it might be a major factor in tissue destruction and remodeling in NEC (Bista et al. J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2005:40(1):60).\n\n\nViral diarrhea is usually self-limiting and is treated with rehydration. When bacterial causes are suspected, antibiotics can be considered. Treatment of colitis includes administration of antibiotics and general non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDS) medications such as Mesalamine (Asacol®) or its derivatives; Azathioprine or similar immunosupressants; steroids such as prednisolone and prednisone; drugs that ameliorate inflammation and pain (buscopan).\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating or preventing enterocolitis (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of enterocolitis) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having enterocolitis. Also provided are methods of treating enterocolitis by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another enterocolitis treatment (e.g., rehygration, antibiotics, NSAIDS, Mesalamine (Asacol®) or its derivatives; Azathioprine or similar immunosupressants; steroids such as prednisolone and prednisone; drugs that ameliorate inflammation and pain (buscopan)).\n\n\nCeliac Disease\n\n\nCoeliac disease (CD), or celiac disease, is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine that occurs in genetically predisposed people of all ages from middle infancy.\n\n\nSymptoms include chronic diarrhoea, failure to thrive (in children), and fatigue, but these may be absent and symptoms in all other organ systems have been described.\n\n\nCD is caused by a reaction to gliadin, a gluten protein found in wheat (and similar proteins of the tribe Triticeae which includes other cultivars such as barley and rye). Upon exposure to gliadin, the enzyme tissue transglutaminase modifies the protein, and the immune system cross-reacts with the bowel tissue, causing an inflammatory reaction. That leads to flattening of the lining of the small intestine, which interferes with the absorption of nutrients.\n\n\nThe presence of a peculiar MMP pattern in active CD strongly dominated by MMP-12 correlates either with IFN-gamma or the degree of mucosal damage (Ciccocioppo et al. J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2005: 85(3):397).\n\n\nTreatment for CD is a gluten-free diet.\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating or preventing CD (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of CD) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having CD. Also provided are methods of treating CD by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another CD treatment (e.g., gluten-free diet).\n\n\nSpinal Cord Injury\n\n\nSpinal cord injury (SCI) causes myelopathy or damage to white matter or myelinated fiber tracts that carry sensation and motor signals to and from the brain. It also damages gray matter in the central part of the spinal cord, causing segmental losses of interneurons and motorneurons. Spinal cord injury can occur from many causes, including: trauma, tumor, ischemia, developmental discorders, neurodegernerative diseases, demyelinative diseases, transverse myelitis, and vascular malformations.\n\n\nMMP-12 expression after spinal cord trauma is deleterious in mice and contributes to the development of secondary injury in SCI (Wells et al. J. Neurosci. 2003: 23(31): 10107).\n\n\nTreatment for acute traumatic spinal cord injuries includes giving a high dose methylprednisolone if the injury occurred within 8 hours. The recommendation is primarily based on the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Studies (NASCIS) II and III.\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating or preventing SCI (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of SCI) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having SCI. Also provided are methods of treating SCI by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another SCI treatment (e.g., methylprednisolone).\n\n\nGuidance regarding the efficacy and dosage an MMP-12 binding protein which will deliver a therapeutically effective amount of the protein can be obtained from animal models of SCI, see e.g., those described in Wells et al. J. Neurosci. 2003: 23(31): 10107), and references cited therein.\n\n\nAcute Lung Injury in Hyperoxia\n\n\nAcute lung injury could be a side effect of therapy with a high concentration of inspired oxygen in patients.\n\n\nOverexpression of Stat3C, a constitutive active form of STAT3, in respiratory epithelial cells of a doxycycline-controlled double-transgenic mouse system protects lung from inflammation and injury caused by hyperoxia. This protection is mediated at least partially through inhibition of hyperoxia-induced synthesis and release of MMP-12 by neutrophils and alveolar resident cells (Lian et al. J Immunol. 2005: 174(11):7250).\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating or preventing acute lung injury in hyperoxia (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of acute lung injury in hyperoxia) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having acute lung injury in hyperoxia. Also provided are methods of treating acute lung injury in hyperoxia by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another acute lung injury in hyperoxia treatment.\n\n\nGuidance regarding the efficacy and dosage an MMP-12 binding protein which will deliver a therapeutically effective amount of the protein can be obtained from animal models of acute lung injury in hyperoxia, see e.g., those described in Lian et al. J Immunol. 2005: 174(11):7250, and references cited therein.\n\n\nPulmonary Inflammatory Diseases\n\n\nStudies using animal models of acute and chronic pulmonary inflammatory diseases have given evidences that MMP-12 is an important mediator of the pathogenesis of these diseases. MMP inhibitor, marimastat could reverse some of these inflammatory events (Menan et al. Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz. 2005: 100:167). MMP-12 also plays an important proinflammatory role in the development of allergic inflammation in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation induced by cockroach antigen (CRA) (Warner et al. Am J. Pathol. 2004:165(6):1921).\n\n\nThe disclosure provides methods of treating or preventing pulmonary inflammatory diseases (e.g., ameliorating symptoms or the worsening of pulmonary inflammatory diseases) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., an inhibitory MMP-12 binding protein, e.g., an anti-MMP-12 IgG or Fab) to a subject having or suspected of having pulmonary inflammatory diseases. Also provided are methods of treating pulmonary inflammatory diseases by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a MMP-12 binding protein with another pulmonary inflammatory diseases treatment (e.g. antibiotics).\n\n\nGuidance regarding the efficacy and dosage an MMP-12 binding protein which will deliver a therapeutically effective amount of the protein can be obtained from animal models of pulmonary inflammatory diseases, see e.g., those described in Warner et al. Am J. Pathol. 2004:165(6):1921, and references cited therein.\n\n\nCombination Therapies\n\n\nThe MMP-12 binding proteins described herein, e.g., anti-MMP-12 Fabs or IgGs, can be administered in combination with one or more of the other therapies for treating a disease or condition associated with MMP-12 activity, e.g., a disease or condition described herein. For example, an MMP-12 binding protein can be used therapeutically or prophylactically with surgery, another MMP-12 inhibitor, e.g., a small molecule inhibitor, another anti-MMP-12 Fab or IgG (e.g., another Fab or IgG described herein), peptide inhibitor, or small molecule inhibitor. Examples of MMP-12 inhibitors that can be used in combination therapy with an MMP-12 binding protein are described herein.\n\n\nOne or more small-molecule MMP inhibitors can be used in combination with one or more MMP-12 binding proteins described herein. For example, the combination can result in a lower dose of the small-molecule inhibitor being needed, such that side effects are reduced.\n\n\nThe MMP-12 binding proteins described herein can be administered in combination with one or more of the other therapies for treating cancers, including, but not limited to: surgery; radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. For example, proteins that inhibit MMP-12 or that inhibit a downstream event of MMP-12 activity can also be used in combination with other anti-cancer therapies, such as radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgery, or administration of a second agent. For example, the second agent can be a Tie-1 inhibitor (e.g., Tie-1 binding proteins; see e.g., U.S. Ser. No. 11/199,739 and PCT/US2005/0284, both filed Aug. 9, 2005). As another example, the second agent can be one that targets or negatively regulates the VEGF signaling pathway. Examples of this latter class include VEGF antagonists (e.g., anti-VEGF antibodies such as bevacizumab) and VEGF receptor antagonists (e.g., anti-VEGF receptor antibodies). One particularly preferred combination includes bevacizumab. As a further example, the second agent is an inhibitor of plasmin, such as a kunitz domain-containing protein or polypeptide (e.g., a plasmin-inhibiting kunitz domain disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,010,880, such as a protein or polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMHSFCAFKAETGPCRARFDRWFFNIFTRQC\n \n(SEQ ID NO: 1))\n \n \n \nEEFIYGGCEGNQNRFESLEECKKMCTRD\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAs another example, the second agent is an agent that binds to Her2, such as a Her2-binding antibody (e.g., trastuzumab). The combination can further include 5-FU and leucovorin, and/or irinotecan.\n\n\n\nInhibitors of MMP-12 (e.g., the MMP-12 binding proteins disclosed herein) can potentiate the activity of an agent that targets Her2 (e.g., a Her2-binding antibody such as trastuzumab). Accordingly, in one combination therapy for the treatment of breast cancer, the second therapy is an agent that binds Her2, such as a Her2-binding antibody (e.g., trastuzumab). When an MMP-12 binding protein is used in a combination therapy with a Her2 binding agent, the dose of the Her2 binding agent may be reduced from the dose of the Her2 binding agent when administered not in combination with an MMP-12 binding protein (e.g., is at least 10%, 25%, 40%, or 50% less than the dose of the Her2 binding agent when administered not in combination with a MMP-12 binding protein). For example, the dose of trastuzumab, when administered in a combination therapy with an MMP-12 binding protein is less than about 4.0, 3.6, 3.0, 2.4, or 2 mg/kg as an initial (loading) dose, and less than about 2.0, 1.8, 1.5, 1.2, or 1 mg/kg in subsequent doses.\n\n\nThe MMP-12 binding proteins described herein can also be administered in combination with one or more other therapies for treating ocular disorders, such as surgical or medical (e.g., administration of a second agent) therapies. For example, in treatment of age-related macular degeneration (e.g., wet age-related macular degeneration), an MMP-12 binding protein may be administered in conjunction with (e.g., before, during, or after) laser surgery (laser photocoagulation or photocoagulation therapy). As another example, the MMP-12 binding protein can be administered in combination with a second agent, such as a VEGF antagonist (e.g., an anti-VEGF antibody such as bevacizumab or ranibizumab) or a VEGF receptor antagonist (e.g., anti-VEGF receptor antibodies).\n\n\nOther combinations are described above.\n\n\nThe term “combination” refers to the use of the two or more agents or therapies to treat the same patient, wherein the use or action of the agents or therapies overlap in time. The agents or therapies can be administered at the same time (e.g., as a single formulation that is administered to a patient or as two separate formulations administered concurrently) or sequentially in any order. Sequential administrations are administrations that are given at different times. The time between administration of the one agent and another agent can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks. The use of an MMP-12 binding protein described herein can also be used to reduce the dosage of another therapy, e.g., to reduce the side-effects associated with another agent that is being administered, e.g., to reduce the side-effects of an anti-VEGF antibody such as bevacizumab. Accordingly, a combination can include administering a second agent at a dosage at least 10, 20, 30, or 50% lower than would be used in the absence of the MMP-12 binding protein.\n\n\nIn addition, a subject can be treated for an angiogenesis-associated disorder, e.g., a cancer, by administering to the subject a first and second agent. For example, the first agent modulates early stage angiogenesis and the second agent modulates a subsequent stage of angiogenesis or also modulates early stage angiogenesis. The first and second agents can be administered using a single pharmaceutical composition or can be administered separately. In one embodiment, the first agent is a VEGF pathway antagonist (e.g., an inhibitor of a VEGF (e.g., VEGF-A, -B, or -C) or a VEGF receptor (e.g., KDR or VEGF receptor III (Flt4)) or a bFGF pathway antagonist (e.g., an antibody that binds to bFGF or a bFGF receptor). Other VEGF pathway antagonists are also described, herein and elsewhere. In one embodiment, the second agent inhibits or decreases the mobility or invasiveness of tumor cells. For example, the second agent comprises an MMP-12 binding protein. For example, the second agent is an MMP-12 binding protein described herein.\n\n\nOnce a tumor reaches a certain size (e.g., ˜1-2 mm), the tumor requires new vasculature prior to increasing its mass. An early stage of tumor angiogenesis can include a signal from the tumor, e.g., secretion of VEGF, to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels from the host and infiltration of the tumor by the vessels. VEGF can, for example, stimulate proliferation of endothelial cells that are then assembled into blood vessels. A late stage of tumor growth can include metastasis, mobility and invasiveness of tumor cells. This mobility and invasiveness may involve the action of matrix metalloproteinases, e.g., MMP-12. Thus, an effective therapy to treat angiogenesis-related disorders can involve a combination of an agent that modulates an early stage angiogenesis (e.g., VEGF pathway antagonists, e.g., anti-VEGF (e.g., bevacizumab) or anti-VEGF receptor (e.g., anti-KDR) antibodies; or antagonists of other pro-angiogenic pathways, e.g., anti-bFGF antibodies or anti-bFGF receptor (e.g., anti-bFGF receptor-1, -2, -3) antibodies) and an agent that modulates a late stage of tumor growth can include metastasis, mobility and invasiveness of tumor cells s (e.g., antagonists of MMP-12 (e.g., anti-MMP-12 antibodies (e.g., an antibody disclosed herein)). One or more of these agents can be used in combination. One or more of these agents may also be used in combination with other anti-cancer therapies, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy.\n\n\nExemplary VEGF receptor antagonists include inhibitors of a VEGF (e.g., VEGF-A, -B, or -C, for example bevacizumab), modulators of VEGF expression (e.g., INGN-241, oral tetrathiomolybdate, 2-methoxyestradiol, 2-methoxyestradiol nanocrystal dispersion, bevasiranib sodium, PTC-299, Veglin), inhibitors of a VEGF receptor (e.g., KDR or VEGF receptor III (Flt4), for example anti-KDR antibodies, VEGFR2 antibodies such as CDP-791, IMC-1121B, VEGFR2 blockers such as CT-322), VEGFR3 antibodies such as mF4-31C1 from Imclone Systems, modulators of VEGFR expression (e.g., VEGFR1 expression modulator Sirna-027) or inhibitors of VEGF receptor downstream signaling.\n\n\nExemplary inhibitors of VEGF include bevacizumab, pegaptanib, ranibizumab, NEOVASTAT®, AE-941, VEGF Trap, and PI-88.\n\n\nExemplary VEGF receptor antagonists include inhibitors of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity. 4-[4-(1-Amino-1-methylethyl)phenyl]-2-[4-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethyl)phenylamino]pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile (JNJ-17029259) is one of a structural class of 5-cyanopyrimidines that are orally available, selective, nanomolar inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGF-R2). Additional examples include: PTK-787/ZK222584(Astra-Zeneca), SU5416, SU11248 (Pfizer), and ZD6474 ([N-(4-bromo-2-fluorophenyl)-6-methoxy-7-[(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)methoxy]quinazolin-4-amine]), vandetanib, cediranib, AG-013958, CP-547632, E-7080, XL-184, L-21649, and ZK-304709. Other VEGF antagonist agents are broad specificity tyrosine kinase inhibitors, e.g., SU6668 (see, e.g., Bergers, B. et al., 2003 J. Clin. Invest. 111:1287-95), sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, vatalanib, AEE-788, AMG-706, axitinib, BIBF-1120, SU-14813, XL-647, XL-999, ABT-869, BAY-57-9352, BAY-73-4506, BMS-582664, CEP-7055, CHIR-265, OSI-930, and TKI-258. Also useful are agents that down regulate VEGF receptors on the cell surface, such as fenretinide, and agents which inhibit VEGF receptor downstream signaling, such as squalamine\n\n\nThe second agent or therapy can also be another anti-cancer agent or therapy. Non-limiting examples of anti-cancer agents include, e.g., anti-microtubule agents, topoisomerase inhibitors, antimetabolites, mitotic inhibitors, alkylating agents, intercalating agents, agents capable of interfering with a signal transduction pathway, agents that promote apoptosis, radiation, and antibodies against other tumor-associated antigens (including naked antibodies, immunotoxins and radioconjugates). Examples of the particular classes of anti-cancer agents are provided in detail as follows: antitubulin/antimicrotubule, e.g., paclitaxel, vincristine, vinblastine, vindesine, vinorelbin, taxotere; topoisomerase I inhibitors, e.g., irinotecan, topotecan, camptothecin, doxorubicin, etoposide, mitoxantrone, daunorubicin, idarubicin, teniposide, amsacrine, epirubicin, merbarone, piroxantrone hydrochloride; antimetabolites, e.g., 5 fluorouracil (5 FU), methotrexate, 6 mercaptopurine, 6 thioguanine, fludarabine phosphate, cytarabine/Ara C, trimetrexate, gemcitabine, acivicin, alanosine, pyrazofurin, N-Phosphoracetyl-L-Asparate=PALA, pentostatin, 5 azacitidine, 5 Aza 2′ deoxycytidine, ara A, cladribine, 5 fluorouridine, FUDR, tiazofurin, N-[5-[N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6-ylmethyl)-N-methylamino]-2-thenoyl]-L-glutamic acid; alkylating agents, e.g., cisplatin, carboplatin, mitomycin C, BCNU=Carmustine, melphalan, thiotepa, busulfan, chlorambucil, plicamycin, dacarbazine, ifosfamide phosphate, cyclophosphamide, nitrogen mustard, uracil mustard, pipobroman, 4 ipomeanol; agents acting via other mechanisms of action, e.g., dihydrolenperone, spiromustine, and desipeptide; biological response modifiers, e.g., to enhance anti-tumor responses, such as interferon; apoptotic agents, such as actinomycin D; and anti-hormones, for example anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen or, for example antiandrogens such as 4′-cyano-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3′-(trifluoromethyl) propionanilide.\n\n\nA combination therapy can include administering an agent that reduces the side effects of other therapies. The agent can be an agent that reduces the side effects of anti-cancer treatments. For example, the agent can be leucovorin.\n\n\nCombination therapies that include administering an MMP-12 binding protein or other binding protein described herein can also be used to treat a subject having or at risk for another angiogenesis related disorder (e.g., a disorder other than cancer, e.g., disorders that include undesired endothelial cell proliferation or undesirable inflammation, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis).\n\n\nDiagnostic Uses\n\n\nProteins that bind to MMP-12 and identified by the method described herein and/or detailed herein have in vitro and in vivo diagnostic utilities. The MMP-12 binding proteins described herein (e.g., the proteins that bind and inhibit, or the proteins that bind but do not inhibit MMP-12) can be used, e.g., for in vivo imaging, e.g., during a course of treatment for a disease or condition in which MMP-12 is active, e.g., a disease or condition described herein, or in diagnosing a disease or condition described herein.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the disclosure provides a diagnostic method for detecting the presence of an MMP-12, in vitro or in vivo (e.g., in vivo imaging in a subject). The method can include localizing MMP-12 within a subject or within a sample from a subject. With respect to sample evaluation, the method can include, for example: (i) contacting a sample with MMP-12 binding protein; and (ii) detecting location of the MMP-12 binding protein in the sample.\n\n\nAn MMP-12 binding protein can also be used to determine the qualitative or quantitative level of expression of MMP-12 in a sample. The method can also include contacting a reference sample (e.g., a control sample) with the binding protein, and determining a corresponding assessment of the reference sample. A change, e.g., a statistically significant change, in the formation of the complex in the sample or subject relative to the control sample or subject can be indicative of the presence of MMP-12 in the sample. In one embodiment, the MMP-12 binding protein does not cross react with another metalloproteinase.\n\n\nThe MMP-12 binding proteins are also useful for in vivo tumor imaging. Better clinical endpoints are needed to monitor the efficacy of drugs, such as MMP-inhibitors, that are designed to block enzymatic function (Zucker et al, 2001, Nature Medicine 7:655-656). Imaging of tumors in vivo by using labeled MMP-12 binding proteins could be of help to target the delivery of the binding protein to tumors for cancer diagnosis, intraoperative tumor detection, and for investigations of drug delivery and tumor physiology. MMP-12 binding proteins can be used to monitor native enzymatic activity in vivo at invasive sites. Another exemplary method includes: (i) administering the MMP-12 binding protein to a subject; and (iii) detecting location of the MMP-12 binding protein in the subject. The detecting can include determining location or time of formation of the complex.\n\n\nThe MMP-12 binding protein can be directly or indirectly labeled with a detectable substance to facilitate detection of the bound or unbound antibody. Suitable detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials and radioactive materials.\n\n\nComplex formation between the MMP-12 binding protein and MMP-12 can be detected by evaluating the binding protein bound to the MMP-12 or unbound binding protein. Conventional detection assays can be used, e.g., an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), a radioimmunoassay (RIA) or tissue immunohistochemistry. Further to labeling the MMP-12 binding protein, the presence of MMP-12 can be assayed in a sample by a competition immunoassay utilizing standards labeled with a detectable substance and an unlabeled MMP-12 binding protein. In one example of this assay, the biological sample, the labeled standards, and the MMP-12 binding protein are combined and the amount of labeled standard bound to the unlabeled binding protein is determined. The amount of MMP-12 in the sample is inversely proportional to the amount of labeled standard bound to the MMP-12 binding protein.\n\n\nFluorophore and chromophore labeled proteins can be prepared. Because antibodies and other proteins absorb light having wavelengths up to about 310 nm, the fluorescent moieties should be selected to have substantial absorption at wavelengths above 310 nm and preferably above 400 nm. A variety of suitable fluorescers and chromophores are described by Stryer, 1968\n, Science \n162:526 and Brand, L. et al., 1972, \nAnnu. Rev. Biochem. \n41:843 868. The proteins can be labeled with fluorescent chromophore groups by conventional procedures such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,940,475, 4,289,747, and 4,376,110. One group of fluorescers having a number of the desirable properties described above is the xanthene dyes, which include the fluoresceins and rhodamines. Another group of fluorescent compounds are the naphthylamines. Once labeled with a fluorophore or chromophore, the protein can be used to detect the presence or localization of the MMP-12 in a sample, e.g., using fluorescent microscopy (such as confocal or deconvolution microscopy).\n\n\nHistological Analysis. Immunohistochemistry can be performed using the proteins described herein. For example, in the case of an antibody, the antibody can be synthesized with a label (such as a purification or epitope tag), or can be detectably labeled, e.g., by conjugating a label or label-binding group. For example, a chelator can be attached to the antibody. The antibody is then contacted to a histological preparation, e.g., a fixed section of tissue that is on a microscope slide. After an incubation for binding, the preparation is washed to remove unbound antibody. The preparation is then analyzed, e.g., using microscopy, to identify if the antibody bound to the preparation.\n\n\nOf course, the antibody (or other polypeptide or peptide) can be unlabeled at the time of binding. After binding and washing, the antibody is labeled in order to render it detectable.\n\n\nProtein Arrays. The MMP-12 binding protein can also be immobilized on a protein array. The protein array can be used as a diagnostic tool, e.g., to screen medical samples (such as isolated cells, blood, sera, biopsies, and the like). Of course, the protein array can also include other binding proteins, e.g., that bind to MMP-12 or to other target molecules.\n\n\nMethods of producing polypeptide arrays are described, e.g., in De Wildt et al., 2000\n, Nat. Biotechnol. \n18:989-994; Lueking et al., 1999, \nAnal. Biochem. \n270:103-111; Ge, 2000\n, Nucleic Acids Res. \n28, e3, I-VII; MacBeath and Schreiber, 2000, \nScience \n289:1760-1763; WO 01/40803 and WO 99/51773A1. Polypeptides for the array can be spotted at high speed, e.g., using commercially available robotic apparati, e.g., from Genetic MicroSystems or BioRobotics. The array substrate can be, for example, nitrocellulose, plastic, glass, e.g., surface-modified glass. The array can also include a porous matrix, e.g., acrylamide, agarose, or another polymer.\n\n\nFor example, the array can be an array of antibodies, e.g., as described in De Wildt, supra. Cells that produce the proteins can be grown on a filter in an arrayed format. Polypeptide production is induced, and the expressed polypeptides are immobilized to the filter at the location of the cell. A protein array can be contacted with a labeled target to determine the extent of binding of the target to each immobilized polypeptide. Information about the extent of binding at each address of the array can be stored as a profile, e.g., in a computer database. The protein array can be produced in replicates and used to compare binding profiles, e.g., of a target and a non-target.\n\n\nFACS (Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting). The MMP-12 binding protein can be used to label cells, e.g., cells in a sample (e.g., a patient sample). The binding protein is also attached (or attachable) to a fluorescent compound. The cells can then be sorted using fluorescence activated cell sorter (e.g., using a sorter available from Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose Calif.; see also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,627,037; 5,030,002; and 5,137,809). As cells pass through the sorter, a laser beam excites the fluorescent compound while a detector counts cells that pass through and determines whether a fluorescent compound is attached to the cell by detecting fluorescence. The amount of label bound to each cell can be quantified and analyzed to characterize the sample.\n\n\nThe sorter can also deflect the cell and separate cells bound by the binding protein from those cells not bound by the binding protein. The separated cells can be cultured and/or characterized.\n\n\nIn Vivo Imaging. Also featured is a method for detecting the presence of a MMP-12 expressing tissues in vivo. The method includes (i) administering to a subject (e.g., a patient having, e.g., a cancer (e.g., metastatic cancer, e.g., metastatic breast cancer), an inflammatory disease (.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, rhinitis (e.g., allergic rhinitis), inflammatory bowel disease, synovitis, rheumatoid arthritis), heart failure, septic shock, neuropathic pain, osteoarthritis, or an ocular condition (e.g., macular degeneration)) an anti-MMP-12 antibody, conjugated to a detectable marker; (ii) exposing the subject to a means for detecting said detectable marker to the MMP-12 expressing tissues or cells. For example, the subject is imaged, e.g., by NMR or other tomographic means.\n\n\nExamples of labels useful for diagnostic imaging include radiolabels such as \n131\nI, \n111\nIn, \n231\nI, \n99m\nTc, \n32\nP, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, \n14\nC, and \n188\nRh, fluorescent labels such as fluorescein and rhodamine, nuclear magnetic resonance active labels, positron emitting isotopes detectable by a positron emission tomography (“PET”) scanner, chemiluminescers such as luciferin, and enzymatic markers such as peroxidase or phosphatase. Short range radiation emitters, such as isotopes detectable by short range detector probes can also be employed. The protein can be labeled with such reagents; for example, see Wensel and Meares, 1983, \nRadioimmunoimaging and Radioimmunotherapy\n, Elsevier, N.Y. for techniques relating to the radiolabeling of antibodies and D. Colcher et al., 1986, \nMeth. Enzymol. \n121: 802 816.\n\n\nThe binding protein can be labeled with a radioactive isotope (such as \n14\nC, \n3\nH, \n35\nS, \n125\nI, \n32\nP, \n131\nI). A radiolabeled binding protein can be used for diagnostic tests, e.g., an in vitro assay. The specific activity of a isotopically-labeled binding protein depends upon the half life, the isotopic purity of the radioactive label, and how the label is incorporated into the antibody.\n\n\nIn the case of a radiolabeled binding protein, the binding protein is administered to the patient, is localized to cells bearing the antigen with which the binding protein reacts, and is detected or “imaged” in vivo using known techniques such as radionuclear scanning using e.g., a gamma camera or emission tomography. See e.g., A. R. Bradwell et al., “Developments in Antibody Imaging”, \nMonoclonal Antibodies for Cancer Detection and Therapy\n, R. W. Baldwin et al., (eds.), pp 65 85 (Academic Press 1985). Alternatively, a positron emission transaxial tomography scanner, such as designated Pet VI located at Brookhaven National Laboratory, can be used where the radiolabel emits positrons (e.g., \n11\nC, \n18\nF, \n15\nO, and \n13\nN).\n\n\nMRI Contrast Agents. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) uses NMR to visualize internal features of living subject, and is useful for prognosis, diagnosis, treatment, and surgery. MRI can be used without radioactive tracer compounds for obvious benefit. Some MRI techniques are summarized in EP-A-0 502 814. Generally, the differences related to relaxation time constants T1 and T2 of water protons in different environments is used to generate an image. However, these differences can be insufficient to provide sharp high resolution images.\n\n\nThe differences in these relaxation time constants can be enhanced by contrast agents. Examples of such contrast agents include a number of magnetic agents paramagnetic agents (which primarily alter T1) and ferromagnetic or superparamagnetic (which primarily alter T2 response). Chelates (e.g., EDTA, DTPA and NTA chelates) can be used to attach (and reduce toxicity) of some paramagnetic substances (e.g., Fe\n+3\n, Mn\n+2\n, Gd\n+3\n). Other agents can be in the form of particles, e.g., less than 10 mm to about 10 nM in diameter). Particles can have ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or superparamagnetic properties. Particles can include, e.g., magnetite (Fe\n3\nO\n4\n), γ-Fe\n2\nO\n3\n, ferrites, and other magnetic mineral compounds of transition elements. Magnetic particles may include: one or more magnetic crystals with and without nonmagnetic material. The nonmagnetic material can include synthetic or natural polymers (such as sepharose, dextran, dextrin, starch and the like.\n\n\nThe MMP-12 binding protein can also be labeled with an indicating group containing of the NMR active \n19\nF atom, or a plurality of such atoms inasmuch as (i) substantially all of naturally abundant fluorine atoms are the \n19\nF isotope and, thus, substantially all fluorine containing compounds are NMR active; (ii) many chemically active polyfluorinated compounds such as trifluoracetic anhydride are commercially available at relatively low cost; and (iii) many fluorinated compounds have been found medically acceptable for use in humans such as the perfluorinated polyethers utilized to carry oxygen as hemoglobin replacements. After permitting such time for incubation, a whole body MRI is carried out using an apparatus such as one of those described by Pykett, 1982, \nSci. Am. \n246:78 88 to locate and image tissues expressing MMP-12.\n\n\nThe contents of all references, pending patent applications and published patents, cited throughout this application are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. The following examples provide further illustrate and are not limiting.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nSelection and Screening of Anti-MMP-12 Fabs and IgGs\n\n\nSelection strategies employed to identify anti-MMP-12 antibodies are:\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) Selection with capture of a biotinylated form of MMP-12 catalytic domain on a streptavidin coated surface;\n \n(2) Selection with capture of a biotinylated form of proMMP-12 (APMA-activated) on a streptavidin coated surface;\n \n(3) Phage, suitably depleted (e.g., previous contact with streptavidin) were allowed to interact with the target, unbound phage washed away and the output sampled and/or amplified for the next round of selection. This was repeated until the output phage in ELISA analysis indicate a high percentage of binders. The phage clones were converted into sFabs. 88/518 unique sFab were identified by ELISA and sequencing (campaign A) and 168 by sequencing (campaign B). Their ability to inhibit human MMP-12, murine MMP-12 and other MMPs (1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17 and 24) was determined by usual means.

Six hours prior to OVA challenge, M08-H09 was administered IP to the mice. The mice were challenged by pulmonary administration of OVA. On \nday\n 26, metacholine induction and airway hyperresponsiveness was measured. Six different groups were tested. \nGroup\n 1 was a control group that received PBS. \n \n \nGrous\n \n \n 2, 3, 4 and 5 were administered M08-H09 at doses of 1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg. Group 6 was administered 25 mg/kg of M1-H11.\n\n\nThe OVA challenged mice were assessed for BAL inflammation based upon differential cell counts, lung histology by quantifying global inflammation, measurement of airway responsiveness to metacholine challenge, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 ELISA measurement of BAL or protein lung extracts, serum specific IgE measurement, lung histology using congo red staining to determine eosinophil counts around bronchi and measurement of MMP-12 activity in the lungs using a fluorogenic substrate.\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 6\n, M08-H09 at all doses resulted in a decrease in the peribronchial inflammation score. A significant decrease was seen at 10 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg doses of M08-H09.\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 7\n, the differential cell counts showed that M08-H09 results in eosinophil percentages that are decreased.\n\n\nFor the carrageenan-stimulated mouse air pouch model, subcutaneous injection of air into the hind flank or back of mice produces an air pouch in a week, the interior surface of which contains both fibroblast-like and macrophage-like cells. Inflammatory stimulation of the pouch results in leukocyte recruitment to the pouch and release of mediators (cytokines) into the exudate. Preventing inflammatory cell infiltration into the air pouch may translate into preventing inflammation of the synovium in rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nThe effect of M08-H09 on inflammatory cell infiltration was compared to inflammatory cell infiltration indomethacin and a control (PBS). In addition, inflammatory cell recruitment was compared to an unstimulated mouse. As shown in \nFIG. 8\n, M08-H09 significantly decreased total white blood cell infiltration and specifically neutrophil and lymphocyte infiltration.\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nAffinity Matured Variants of M08-H09\n\n\nTable IX summarizes \ncycle\n 1 of the affinity maturation of M08-H09.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(The HV-CDR1 column discloses SEQ ID NOS 12-26 and the HV-CDR2 column discloses SEQ ID NOS 27-41):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nInhibition assays\n\n\nBIACORE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSelection \n\n\nHV-\n\n\n \n\n\nN-\n\n\n(sFAB)\n\n\n(coated Fab)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Name\n\n\nmethod\n\n\nCDR1\n\n\nHV-CDR2\n\n\nGly\n\n\nIC50hu (nM)\n\n\nIC50 m\n\n\nKD hu\n\n\nkoff m (1/s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n539B-M0008-H09\n\n\n \n\n\nDYNMH\n\n\nYIGPSGGYTHYADSVKG\n\n\n1\n\n\n12.1 + 2.5 \n\n\n<10\n\n\n1.77E−08\n\n\n4.00E−03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n539B-M0063-B01\n\n\nstraight human\n\n\nWYWMG\n\n\nSISPSGGYTFYADSVKG\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.7 + 0.1\n\n\n>10\n\n\n1.71E−10\n\n\n2.50E−03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n539B-M0063-B11\n\n\nstraight human\n\n\nPYWMH\n\n\nGIGPSGGLTFYADSVKG\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.7 + 0.1\n\n\n>10\n\n\n1.20E−10\n\n\n3.11E−03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n539B-M0063-C07\n\n\nstraight human\n\n\nPYWMS\n\n\nGISPSGGITFYADSVKG\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.0 + 0.1\n\n\n<10\n\n\n2.29E−09\n\n\n2.00E−03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n539B-M0063-G01\n\n\nstraight human\n\n\nWYWMV\n\n\nSIGPSGGDTYYADSVKG\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.8 + 0.1\n\n\n>10\n\n\n1.58E−09\n\n\n6.54E−03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n539B-M0065-E12\n\n\nstraight mouse\n\n\nWYNMH\n\n\nGISPSGGNTMYADSVKG\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.4 + 0.1\n\n\n<10\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n539B-M0065-G03\n\n\nstraight mouse\n\n\nWYGMG\n\n\nVIVSSGGFTQYADSVKG\n\n\n1\n\n\n3.0 + 0.2\n\n\n<10\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n539B-M0065-H05\n\n\nstraight mouse\n\n\nYYGMG\n\n\nVISSSGGFTFYADSVKG\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.7 + 0.1\n\n\nND\n\n\n2.19E−09\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n539B-M0067-B06\n\n\nalternate\n\n\nWYWMH\n\n\nGIVSSGGTTIYADSVKG\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.7 + 0.1\n\n\n<10\n\n\n6.20E−10\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n539B-M0067-F06\n\n\nalternate\n\n\nWYNMS\n\n\nRISPSGGDTGYADSVKG\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.7 + 0.1\n\n\n<10\n\n\n2.03E−10\n\n\n2.50E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n539B-M0069-C02\n\n\nTIMP + MMP12\n\n\nYYNMH\n\n\nGIGPSGGGTLYADSVKG\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.6 + 0.2\n\n\n~10\n\n\n6.97E−09\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n539B-M0069-D10\n\n\nTIMP + MMP12\n\n\nLYHMH\n\n\nGIGPSGGWTIYADSVKG\n\n\n1\n\n\n2.3 + 0.1\n\n\n<10\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n539B-M0071-A01\n\n\nLead + MMP12\n\n\nEYWMT\n\n\nGISPSGGMTFYADSVKG\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.3 + 0.1\n\n\n>10\n\n\n1.10E−09\n\n\n1.00E−02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n539B-M0071-D09\n\n\nLead + MMP12\n\n\nPYWMH\n\n\nGISSSGGDTLYADSVKG\n\n\n1\n\n\n2.4 + 0.2\n\n\n<10\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n539B-M0071-H03\n\n\nLead + MMP12\n\n\nPYWMH\n\n\nGIGPSGGPTFYADSIKG\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.2 + 0.1\n\n\n<10\n\n\n1.03E−09\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKD\nhUMMP12 \nimprovement ~10-100x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKoff\nmMMP12 \nimprovement ~2-10x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn cycle II of the affinity maturation, 109 Fabs were analyzed and 26 Fabs were selected as improved inhibitors.

No. 60/132,509, filed May 4, 1999.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nThe present invention relates to piperazine derivatives useful as selective CCR5 antagonists, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treatment using the compounds. The invention also relates to the use of a combination of a CCR5 antagonist of this invention and one or more antiviral or other agents useful in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The invention further relates to the use of a CCR-5 antagonist of this invention, alone or in combination with another agent, in the treatment of solid organ transplant rejection, graft v. host disease, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, asthma, allergies or multiple sclerosis.\n\n\nThe global health crisis caused by HIV, the causative agent of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), is unquestioned, and while recent advances in drug therapies have been successful in slowing the progression of AIDS, there is still a need to find a safer, more efficient, less expensive way to control the virus.\n\n\nIt has been reported that the CCR5 gene plays a role in resistance to HIV infection. HIV infection begins by attachment of the virus to a target cell membrane through interaction with the cellular receptor CD4 and a secondary chemokine co-receptor molecule, and proceeds by replication and dissemination of infected cells through the blood and other tissue. There are various chemokine receptors, but for macrophage-tropic HIV, believed to be the key pathogenic strain that replicates in vivo in the early stages of infection, the principal chemokine receptor required for the entry of HIV into the cell is CCR5. Therefore, interfering with the interaction between the viral receptor CCR5 and HIV can block HIV entry into the cell. The present invention relates to small molecules which are CCR5 antagonists.\n\n\nCCR-5 receptors have been reported to mediate cell transfer in inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, asthma and allergies, and inhibitors of such receptors are expected to be useful in the treatment of such diseases, and in the treatment of other inflammatory diseases or conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, solid organ transplant rejection and graft v. host disease.\n\n\nRelated piperazine derivatives which are muscarinic antagonists useful in the treatment of cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,883,096; 6,037,352; 5,889,006.\n\n\nA-M. Vandamme et al., \nAntiviral Chemistry \n& \nChemotherapy, \n9:187-203 (1998) disclose current clinical treatments of HIV-1 infections in man including at least triple drug combinations or so-called Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (“HAART”); HAART involves various combinations of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (“NRTI”), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (“NNRTI”) and HIV protease inhibitors (“PI”). In compliant drug-naive patients, HAART is effective in reducing mortality and progression of HIV-1 to AIDS. However, these multidrug therapies do not eliminate HIV-1 and long-term treatment usually results in multidrug resistance. Development of new drug therapies to provide better HIV-1 treatment remains a priority.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to the treatment of HIV comprising administering to a mammal in need of such treatment an effective amount of a CCR5 antagonist represented by the structural formula I:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein\n\n\n\nR is R\n8\n-phenyl, R\n8\n-pyridyl, R\n8\n-thiophenyl or R\n8\n-naphthyl;\n\n\nR\n1 \nis hydrogen or C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl;\n\n\nR\n2 \nis R\n9\n,R\n10\n,R\n11\n-phenyl; R\n9\n,R\n10\n,R\n11\n-substituted 6-membered heteroaryl; R\n9\n,R\n10\n,R\n11\n-substituted 6-membered heteroaryl N-oxide; R\n12\n,R\n13\n-substituted 5-membered heteroaryl; naphthyl; fluorenyl; diphenylmethyl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n3 \nis hydrogen, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, C\n3\n-C\n10 \ncycloalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n10 \ncycloalkyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, R\n8\n-phenyl, R\n8\n-phenyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, R\n8\n-naphthyl, R\n8\n-naphthyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, R\n8\n-heteroaryl or R\n8\n-heteroaryl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl;\n\n\nR\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n7 \nand R\n13 \nare independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl;\n\n\nR\n6 \nis hydrogen, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl or C\n2\n-C\n6 \nalkenyl;\n\n\nR\n8 \nis 1 to 3 substituents independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxy, —CF\n3\n, CF\n3\nO—, CH\n3\nC(O)—, —CN, CH\n3\nSO\n2\n—, CF\n3\nSO\n2\n—, R\n14\n-phenyl, R\n14\n-benzyl, CH\n3\nC(═NOCH\n3\n), CH\n3\nC(═NOCH\n2\nCH\n3\n),\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n—NH\n2\n, —NHCOCF\n3\n, —NHCONH(C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl), —NHCO(C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl), —NHSO\n2\n(C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl), 5-membered heteroaryl and\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein X is —O—, —NH— or —N(CH\n3\n)—;\n\n\n\nR\n9 \nand R\n10 \nare independently selected from the group consisting of (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, halogen, —NR\n17\nR\n18\n, —OH, —CF\n3\n, —OCH\n3\n, —O-acyl, —OCF\n3 \nand —Si(CH\n3\n)\n3\n;\n\n\nR\n11 \nis R\n9\n, hydrogen, phenyl, —NO\n2\n, —CN, —CH\n2\nF, —CHF\n2\n, —CHO, —CH═NOR\n17\n, pyridyl, pyridyl N-oxide, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, —N(R\n17\n)CONR\n18\nR\n19\n, —NHCONH(chloro-(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl), —NHCONH((C\n3\n-C\n1\n)cycloalkyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl), —NHCO(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, —NHCOCF\n3\n, —NHSO\n2\nN((C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl)\n2\n, —NHSO\n2\n(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, —N(SO\n2\nCF\n3\n)\n2\n, —NHCO\n2\n(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, C\n3\n-C\n10 \ncycloalkyl, —SR\n20\n, —SOR\n20\n, —SO\n2\nR\n20\n, —SO\n2\nNH(C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl), —OSO\n2\n(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, —OSO\n2\nCF\n3\n, hydroxy(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, —CONR\n17\nR\n18\n, —CON(CH\n2\nCH\n2\n—O—CH\n3\n)\n2\n, —OCONH(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, —CO\n2\nR\n17\n, —Si(CH\n3\n)\n3 \nor —B(OC(CH\n3\n)\n2\n)\n2\n;\n\n\nR\n12 \nis (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, —NH\n2 \nor R\n14\n-phenyl;\n\n\nR\n14 \nis 1 to 3 substituents independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, —CF\n3\n, —CO\n2\nR\n17\n, —CN, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy and halogen;\n\n\nR\n15 \nand R\n16 \nare independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, or R\n15 \nand R\n16 \ntogether are a C\n2\n-C\n5 \nalkylene group and with the carbon to which they are attached form a spiro ring of 3 to 6 carbon atoms;\n\n\nR\n17\n, R\n18 \nand R\n19 \nare independently selected from the group consisting of H and C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl; and\n\n\nR\n20 \nis C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl or phenyl.\n\n\nPreferred are compounds of formula I wherein R is R\n8\n-phenyl or R\n8\n-naphthyl, especially wherein R\n8 \nis a single substituent, and especially wherein the R\n8 \nsubstituent is in the 4-position.

For 6-membered heteroaryl rings, carbon atoms can be substituted by R\n9\n, R\n10 \nor R\n11 \ngroups. Nitrogen atoms can form an N-oxide. All regioisomers are contemplated, e.g., 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl and 4-pyridyl. Typical 6-membered heteroaryl groups are pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl and the N-oxides thereof. For 5-membered heteroaryl rings, carbon atoms can be substituted by R\n12 \nor R\n13 \ngroups. Typical 5-membered heteroaryl rings are furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl and isoxazolyl. 5-Membered rings having one heteroatom can be joined through the 2- or 3-position; 5-membered rings having two heteroatoms are preferably joined through the 4-position. Bicyclic groups typically are benzo-fused ring systems derived from the heteroaryl groups named above, e.g. quinolyl, phthalazinyl, quinazolinyl, benzofuranyl, benzothienyl and indolyl.\n\n\nPreferred points of substitution for 6-membered heteroaryl rings at R\n2 \nare described above. When R\n2 \nis a 5-membered heteroaryl group, the R\n12 \nand R\n13 \nsubstituents are preferably attached to carbon ring members adjacent to the carbon joining the ring to the rest of the molecule, and R\n12 \nis preferably alkyl; however, if a heteroatom is adjacent to the carbon joining the ring to the rest of the molecule (i.e., as in 2-pyrrolyl), R\n12 \nis preferably attached to a carbon ring member adjacent to the carbon joining the ring to the rest of the molecule.\n\n\nHalogen represents fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.\n\n\nOne or more, preferably one to four, antiviral agents useful in anti-HIV-1 therapy may be used in combination with a CCR5 antagonist of the present invention.

No. 5,368,854), steroids and azulfidine;\n \nrheumatoid arthritis: methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, steroids and mycophenolate mofetil;\n \nmultiple sclerosis: interferon-beta, interferon-alpha, and steroids.\n \n \n \n\n\nCertain compounds of the invention may exist in different isomeric forms (e.g., enantiomers, diastereoisomers, atropisomers and rotamers). The invention contemplates all such isomers both in pure form and in admixture, including racemic mixtures.\n\n\nCertain compounds will be acidic in nature, e.g. those compounds which possess a carboxyl or phenolic hydroxyl group. These compounds may form pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of such salts may include sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, gold and silver salts. Also contemplated are salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable amines such as ammonia, alkyl amines, hydroxyalkylamines, N-methylglucamine and the like.\n\n\nCertain basic compounds also form pharmaceutically acceptable salts, e.g., acid addition salts. For example, the pyrido-nitrogen atoms may form salts with strong acid, while compounds having basic substituents such as amino groups also form salts with weaker acids. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic and other mineral and carboxylic acids well known to those in the art. The salts are prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in the conventional manner. The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous NaOH, potassium carbonate, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate. The free base forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the acid and base salts are otherwise equivalent to their respective free base forms for purposes of the invention.\n\n\nAll such acid and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention and all acid and base salts are considered equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the invention.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention can be made by the procedures known in the art, for example by the procedures described in the following reaction schemes, by the methods described in the examples below, and by using the methods described in WO96/26196 and WO98/05292.\n\n\nThe following solvents and reagents may be referred to herein by the abbreviations indicated: tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethanol (EtOH); methanol (MeOH); acetic acid (HOAc or AcOH); ethyl acetate (EtOAc), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF); trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); 1-hydroxy-benzotriazole (HOST); m-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPSA); triethylamine (Et\n3\nN); diethyl ether (Et\n2\nO); dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO); and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride (DEC). RT is room temperature, and TLC is thin-layer chromatography.

Depending upon the desired R\n6 \nsubstituent, this is processed in two ways. Reductive amination gives (6), which can be deprotected to (7) and finally acylated to the compounds of formula IA wherein R\n5 \nand R\n6 \nare H; alternatively, a modified Strecker reaction on (5) gives the aminonitrile (8), which, after treatment with methyl Grignard to give (9), deprotection to (10) and final N-acylation affords the compounds of formula IB wherein R\n5 \nis H and R\n6 \nis methyl. Acylation of (7) and (10) is carried out under standard conditions, e.g., with a compound R\n2\nCOOH and reagents such as DEC and HOBT. Use of a chiral compound of formula I, e.g., (S)-methyl 4-substituted benzylamine, and a chiral lactate in step a, e.g., methyl(R)-lactate triflate, will result in chiral compounds of formulas IA and IB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nReagents: j: oxaborazolidine, BH\n3\n; k: CH\n3\nSO\n2\nCl, base; l: CF\n3\nCO\n2\nH.\n\n\n\nIn Scheme 2, the compounds are prepared by an alkylation process on a pre-formed piperazine derivative. For example, preferred compounds with the S,S stereochemistry may be obtained in this way by chiral reduction of a ketone (11) to the alcohol (12), activation as the mesylate, and displacement with inversion by treatment with a suitable piperazine, which may either be mono-protected, in which case final elaboration requires deprotection followed by the steps described in (e)-(g) in Scheme 1 to obtain IC, or may be elaborated prior to the displacement step, in which case the final steps are (f) and (g) (deprotection and acylation) as in Scheme 1 to obtain ID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor compounds where R\n3 \nand R\n1 \nare each H, either the alkylation route of Scheme 2 or a reductive amination method as typified in Scheme 3 can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor diaryl compounds, wherein R and R\n3 \nare each aryl, an alkylation method as typified in Scheme 4 is preferred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiperazines of formula 14, especially those wherein R\n3 \nis C\n2\n-C\n6 \nalkyl or benzyl, may also be obtained by a process wherein the\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nportion is introduced as shown above by an alkylation-decyanation sequence. The reaction is exemplified for compounds wherein R is CF\n3\nO-phenyl, R\n1 \nis hydrogen, R\n3 \nis ethyl and R\n4 \nis methyl, but using appropriate starting materials, other compounds of formula 14 can be similarly prepared.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nReagents: m: BOC\n2\nO, base, n: R\n6\nMgBr; o: CCl\n3\nCO\n2\nH, NaBH\n3\nCN; p: CF\n3\nCO\n2\nH; q: NaBH\n4\n, BF\n3\n.\n\n\n\nAs shown in Scheme 6, compounds bearing an additional alkyl group at R\n5 \non the piperazine ring may be prepared from the diketopiperazine intermediates (4) of Scheme 1. (4) is activated by conversion to the N(t-butoxycarbonyl) compound (17); addition of a Grignard reagent and sequential reduction, deprotection and lactam reduction provides (21), which can be used to prepare compounds of formula I in the manner described for intermediate (5) in Scheme 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany piperazines wherein R is R\n8\n-phenyl (or their Boc derivatives) shown in Scheme 1 can be obtained from a common intermediate, wherein R\n8 \nis 1. Several examples are shown in the above scheme, wherein R\n8 \nis converted to Cl, CN, —C(O)NH\n2\n, H, Ph and p-ClC\n6\nH\n4\nCH\n2\n—. Detailed procedures for these conversions are provided in the examples below The resultant piperazine or BOC-piperazine is then treated as shown in Scheme 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome compounds of the invention may be obtained by a Mannich method, as shown in the specific example of Scheme 8.\n\n\nCompounds useful in this invention are exemplified by the following preparative examples, which should not be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure.

After 10 min., a solution of 2M borane-methyl sulfide complex (3 ml; 6 mmol) in THF was added dropwise over 5 min. TLC at the end of 30 min. showed that the starting material had been converted to a more polar product. The reaction was quenched with about 5 ml of CH\n3\nOH carefully until effervescence stopped; volatiles were removed in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nand washed with 1N HCl, water, 10% NaHCO\n3 \nsolution and brine. Concentration in vacuo gave 2 g of a yellow gum. Flash silica gel chromatography (FSGC) using 10-20% EtOAc in hexanes furnished the desired chiral alcohol (1.6 g; 84%) as a colorless oil. TLC R\nf\n=0.6 in 25% EtOAc:hexanes.\n\n\nStep 2: To a solution of the product of step 1 (1.55 g; 8.16 mmol) in 10 ml of CH\n2\nCl\n2 \ncooled in an ice bath were added Et\n3\nN (2.3 ml; 16.32 mmol) and CH\n3\nSO\n2\nCl (0.87 ml; 10.6 mmol) to form a turbid white solution. The reaction was quenched with water and the organic product was extracted with CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, washing with water, 1N HCl, 10% NaHCO\n3 \nsolution and brine. Concentration in vacuo gave the chiral mesylate (2.1 g; 96%) as a pale yellow oil. TLC R\nf\n=0.6 in 25% EtOAc:hexanes.\n\n\nStep 3: A solution of the product of step 2 (2.1 g; 7.8 mmol), the N—BOC protected 2(S)-methyl piperazine (1.56 g 7.8 mmol—prepared from the reaction of commercial 2(S)-methyl piperazine with N-(tert-butoxy-carbonyloxy)phthalimide) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine (1.34 ml; 8 mmol) in 14 ml of dry CN\n3\nCN were heated at reflux until TLC indicated complete disappearance of the mesylate (16 h).

FSGC using 10% CH\n3\nOH in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nremoved the less polar impurity and gradient elution with 1% Et\n3\nN in 1004 CH\n3\nOH:CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nwas needed to elute the desired free amine of the (S,S) diastereomer. Yield=0.9 g (75%). TLC R\nf\n=0.5 in 10% CH\n3\nOH:CH\n2\nCl\n2\n.\n\n\nStep 5: A colorless solution of the product of step 4 (0.9 g; 3.3 mmol), 4-piperidinone (0.86 g; 4.3 mmol), NaB(OAc)\n3\nH (1.05 g; 4.95 mmol) and glacial AcOH (80 μl ) in 8 ml of CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nwas stirred at ambient temperature for a day. TLC indicated absence of starting material. The reaction mixture was diluted with 50 ml of CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, washed with 1N NaOH solution, water (2×) and brine. The CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nextract was dried over anhydrous MgSO\n4 \nand concentrated to obtain 10.7 g of yellow oil. FSGC (25% acetone in hexanes) was used to isolate the pure product (1.3 g; 86%) as a white foam. TLC R\nf\n=0.6 in 25% acetone/hexanes.\n\n\nStep 6: TFA (5 ml) was added to a solution of the product of step 5 (1.3 g; 2.87 mmol) in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(10 ml) and the resulting yellow orange solution was stirred at RT for 7 h. The reaction was quenched with 1N NaOH solution and the pH was adjusted to 10. The organic product was extracted into 50 ml of CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nand washed with water, then brine and dried over MgSO\n4\n. Concentration gave the free amine (0.98 g; 98%) as a yellow syrup.

After stirring at RT for 2 h, the volatiles were removed on a rotary evaporator and the white residue was suspended in dry toluene (3×10 ml) and azeotroped. The white solid thus obtained was suspended in dry Et\n2\nO containing 10% EtOAc, stirred for 30 min, filtered and washed with Et\n2\nO (100 ml).

The reaction mixture was then treated with Et\n2\nAlCN (5.5 ml; 1M solution in toluene) and stirring continued for 20 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc and stirred with saturated NaHCO\n3 \nsolution (10 min.) and the layers were separated as much as possible. The turbid (from inseparable aqueous layer) organic layer was treated with excess celite and filtered, washing the filtercake with EtOAc. The filtrate layers were separated and the organic layer was washed with water and brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO\n4 \nand concentrated to obtain 2.16 g (98%) of an amber gum.\n\n\nStep 2: The Strecker amine from step 1 (2.16 g) was dissolved in dry THF, cooled in an ice bath and treated with CH\n3\nMgBr (7.5 ml of a 3M solution in Et\n2\nO). After 1 h, the ice bath was removed and the yellow, heterogeneous reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 18 h. The reaction was quenched with saturated NH\n4\nCl solution, diluted with water and extracted with CH\n2\nCl\n2\n. Concentration gave 2.2 g of a yellow gum which was purified by FSGC, eluting the major product away from more polar impurities using a 1:1 mixture of CH\n2\nCl\n2\n:EtOAc. The ipso-methyl compound was isolated as a yellow gum (1.85 g; 88%). TLC R\nf\n=0.5 in 1:1 Et\n2\nO:hexanes.\n\n\nStep 3: TFA (6 ml) was added to a solution of the product of step 2 (15 g; 3.2 mmol) in 10 ml of CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nand stirred at 25° C. for 2 h. The reaction was quenched with 1N NaOH solution to a pH of 9-10 and processed by extraction into CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nto obtain 1.2 g of crude product. FSGC using 1:1 CH\n2\nCl\n2\n:EtOAc removed all the less polar impurities and gradient elution with 10% CH\n3\nOH in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nand finally with 10% (ca. 7N—NH\n3\n) CH\n3\nOH in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nled to the isolation of the free piperidine as a yellow gum (1.07 g; 90%). TLC R\nf\n=0.2 in 10% CH\n3\nOH:CH\n2\nCl\n2\n.\n\n\nStep 4: A solution of the product of step 3 (1.03 g; 2.8 mmol), 2,4-dimethyl nicotinic acid (0.42 g; 2.8 mmol), DEC (0.8 g; 4.2 mmol), HOBT (0.57 g; 4.2 mmol) and diisopropyl ethyl amine (1 ml; 5.6 mmol) in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(15 ml) was stirred at 25° C. for 24 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(25 ml), washed with water, 10% NaHCO\n3 \nsolution and brine, then concentrated to obtain 1.6 g of crude oil. FSGC of this material using gradient elution with 10% acetone-CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nfollowed by 2-5% CH\n3\nOH in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \ngave the title compound (1.1 g; 80%) as a white foam. TLC R\nf\n=0.45 in 5% CH\n3\nOH—CH\n2\nCl\n2\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe free base of the title compound (1 g; 2 mmol) isolated above was dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of EtOAc:Et\n2\nO (8 ml) and a fresh solution of hydrogen chloride in Et\n2\nO (6-1 ml of a 1M solution) was added, instantly forming a white precipitate After stirring at 25° C. for 1 h, the volatiles were removed in vacuo, The product was suspended in Et\n2\nO and filtered, washing the filtrate with Et\n2\nO. The HCl salt of the title compound thus obtained was dried in vacuo (1.1 g; mp 213-215° C.).

The reaction was cooled to RT, diluted with EtOAc and saturated aqueous NaHCO\n3\n. The EtOAc layer was removed, washed with water, dried with brine and evaporated to give a crude oil which was purified by preparative plate chromatography (2000 μM silica plates; 8:1 hexanes:EtOAc eluant), to give, after isolation of the appropriate band, the cyano intermediate (0.2 g) in 77% yield.\n\n\nStep 2: The product of Step 1 (0.2 g) was dissolved in MeOH (1.5 ml) and HCl (4M solution in 1,4-dioxane; 2 ml) was added. The resulting solution was stirred at 50° C. for 3 h and evaporated. This crude intermediate (0.038 g) and the product of Example 8, Step 3 (65 mg; trihydrochloride form) were treated in the same fashion as Example 8, Step 4, using DMF (2 ml), HOBt (45 mg), DEC (60 mg) and diisopropyl ethyl amine (0.1 ml) to give, after isolation and purifications the free base form of 8AO, which was converted to its HCl salt (45 mg) in 95% yield.\n\n\n8AP:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 1: 2,6-Dimethyl-4-formyl benzoic acid (1.96 g) (see 8W) was dissolved in t-butanol (94 ml) and 2-methyl-2-butene (24 ml). A solution of NaClO\n2 \n(6.89 g), NaH\n2\nPO\n4 \nmonohydrate (8.17 g) and water (45 ml) was added dropwise to the first solution. After complete addition, the pH was adjusted to 3 and two layers resulted. The organic layer was removed and evaporated to give intermediate acid (1.80 g) as a white crystalline solid, which was used without purification.\n\n\nStep 2: To a solution of the product of Step 1 (0.62 g), CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(5 ml) and DMF (1 drop) was added oxalyl chloride (0.31 ml) and the resulting solution was stirred for 10 min, at which time a second portion of oxalyl chloride (0.30 ml) was added. The reaction was stirred for 10 min, toluene was added and the mixture was evaporated to dryness. CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(10 ml) and EtNH\n2 \n(1 ml) were added and the reaction was stirred for 2 days, then partitioned between brine and CH\n2\nCl\n2\n. The CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nlayer was evaporated and HCl (4 ml of a 4 M solution in 1,4-dioxane) was added. The resulting solution was stirred for 3 h and evaporated to give a solid which was washed with Et\n2\nO and collected to give the amide intermediate (0.13 g) in 24% yield.\n\n\nStep 3: The product of Example 8, Step 3 (60 mg; trihydrochloride form) and the product of step 2 (35 mg) were treated in the same fashion as Example 8, Step 4 to give, after work up and purification, 8AP as the free base form, which was converted to the HCl salt (50 mg) in 62% yield.\n\n\n8AQ:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 1: To a solution of the amine intermediate (2 g) (see 8Z) was added NaH (0.4 g of a 60% oil dispersion). The resulting suspension was stirred for 15 min and Me\n2\nSO\n4 \nwas added. After heating at reflux for 1.5 h, the reaction was cooled to RT, poured into saturated NH\n4\nCl aqueous solution and extracted with Et\n2\nO. After evaporation, the crude reaction mixture was chromatographed on silica get, eluting with 4:1 hexanes:EtOAc, to give, after evaporation of the appropriate fractions, the methylamine intermediate (0.8 g) in 38% yield.\n\n\nStep 2: The product of Step 1 (0.12 g), THF (5 ml) and EtNCO (54 mg) were heated at reflux for 17 h. EtNCO (54 mg) and 1,4-dioxane (2 ml) were added and the resulting solution was heated in a sealed tube at 65° C. for 17 h.

The reaction mixture was cooled to RT and volatiles were removed in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(30 ml) and washed with water and brine. Concentration gave the crude product, which was purified by FSGC (10% EtOAc-hexanes) to obtain 2.1 g (88%) of product as a pale yellow liquid.\n\n\n\n\nTFA (6 ml) was added to a solution of the above compound (2.1 g; 6.56 mmol) in 12 ml of CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nand the mixture stirred at 25° C. for 1.5 h. The reaction was quenched with 1N NaOH and adjusted to pH 10. Extractive work-up in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nfurnished the desired product (1.4 g; 97%) as a colorless gum.\n\n \n \nStep 2: A mixture of the product of step 1 (1.4 g; 6.36 mmol), N-BOC-4-piperidinone (1.27 g; 6.4 mmol) and Ti(OiPr)\n4 \n(1.9 ml; 6.4 mmol) was stirred at 25° C. for 24 h. A 1M solution of Et\n2\nAlCN in toluene (7.6 ml) was added to the reaction mixture and the mixture stirred at ambient temperature for another day. The Strecker amine thus formed was worked-up and isolated (2.7 g; 100%) as described in Example 8, step 2. TLC R\nf\n=0.3 in 25% EtOAc—CH\n2\nCl\n2\n.\n \n\n\nThe Strecker amine (2.7 g; 6.3 mmol) was dissolved in 15 ml of dry THF at 0° C. and CH\n3\nMgBr (3M in Et\n2\nO; 10.5 ml) was added to it. After 1 h, the ice bath was removed and the reaction allowed to proceed at RT for 15 h. TLC analysis of the heterogeneous reaction mixture showed no change from the starting material; the mixture was warmed at 60° C. for 5 h with no observed change in TLC behavior. The reaction mixture was quenched with saturated NH\n4\nCl and organic products extracted into CH\n2\nCl\n2\n. FSGC of the crude product (2.7 g) using 15% acetone-hexanes as the eluant provided the desired ipso-methyl compound as a colorless gum (2.3 g; 87%).\n\n \n \nStep 3: The product of step 2 (1.7 g; 4.08 mmol), ammonium formate (1.4 g; 22 mmol) and 10% palladium on carbon (0.4 g) were mixed in 20 ml of CH\n3\nOH and heated at reflux for 5 h. The reaction mixture was filtered through celite and volatiles were removed. The residue was dissolved in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nand washed with 1.0% NaOH solution, water and brine.

This solution was treated with a solution of sodium hexa-methyl disilazide in THF (1M; 26 ml) followed after 5 min with neat allyl bromide (6 ml). Upon removal of the bath and letting the reaction mixture warm to RT (˜1 h), it changed from a yellow solution to dark reddish brown solution. The reaction was quenched with saturated NH\n4\nCl solution and the product extracted with EtOAc, washed with water, brine and dried. Concentration in vacuo afforded a brown semi solid. FSGC of this material using 25% Et\n2\nO in hexane as eluant gave 2.5 grams (92%) of the desired product as an amber gum (TLC R\nf\n=0.65, 0.6 for two overlapping spots).\n\n\nStep 3: A solution of the product of Step 2 (2.4 g) in CH\n3\nOH was treated with 10% Pd/C (0.2 g) and placed under a balloon of H\n2 \ngas. After stirring at RT for 4 h, the catalyst was removed via filtration through celite. Concentration of the filtrate yielded an amber gum.\n\n\n\n\nThe α-propyl nitrite obtained above was dissolved in CH\n3\nCN (12 ml). Magnesium bromide etherate (2.1 g; 8.14 mmol) and sodium triacetoxy borohydride (3.44 g; 16.2 mmol) were added and the reaction mixture was stirred at RT overnight. The reaction was quenched with water and rendered basic with saturated NaHCO\n3\n. The organic products were extracted with EtOAc and processed to obtain ˜2 g of crude material. FSGC (10-25% Et\n2\nO in hexane) served to isolate two diasteromeric products (1.7 g total; 79% for two steps):\n\n \n \n(S,S)-Diastereomer (A): TLC R\nf\n=0.6 (25% Et\n2\nO-Hexane). 0.9 g of a colorless gum.\n \n(R,S)-Diastereomer (B): TLC R\nf\n=0.5 (25% Et\n2\nO-Hexane). 0.8 g of a colorless gum.\n \nStep 4: Removal of the BOC-protecting group from the intermediate A was accomplished by treatment with TFA in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n. The isolated free piperazine (0.68 g; 2.3 mmol), N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-piperidinone (0.45 g; 2.3 mmol) and Ti(OiPr)\n4 \n(0.7 mL; 2.5 mmol) were dissolved in 10 ml of CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nand stirred overnight Et\n2\nAlCN (1M in toluene; 2.7 ml) was introduced into the reaction mixture and the resultant solution was stirred for a day. The reaction was diluted with EtOAc and quenched with water. Celite was added to aid in the filtration of titanium and aluminum salts. The biphasic filtrate was washed with water, brine and dried. Concentration in vacuo yielded 1.1 g of a yellow gum (TLC R\nf\n=0.55 in 25% EtOAc-hexane).\n \n\n\nThe resultant ipso-cyano compound was dissolved in dry THF (8 ml) and treated with a solution of CH\n3\nMgBr (3M in Et\n2\nO; 6 ml) and stirred overnight at RT. The reaction flask was placed in a cold water bath and carefully quenched with saturated NH\n4\nCl solution. The organic product was extracted with EtOAc and washed with water and brine Concentration to a crude product which was purified by rapid FSGC (10-25% EtOAc in hexane) gave the BOC-piperidinyl compound as a pale yellow gum (1.1 g; 100%).

This assay utilizes membranes prepared from NIH 3T3 cells expressing the human CCR5 chemokine receptor which have the ability to bind to RANTES, a natural ligand for the receptor. Using a 96-well plate format, membrane preparations are incubated with \n125\nI-RANTES in the presence or absence of compound for one hour. Compounds are serially diluted over a wide range of 0.001 ug/ml to 1 ug/ml and tested in triplicates. Reaction cocktails are harvested through glass fiber filters, and washed thoroughly. Total counts for replicates are averaged and data reported as the concentration required to inhibit 50 percent of total \n125\nI-RANTES binding. Compounds with potent activity in the membrane binding assay are further characterized in secondary cell-based HIV-1 entry and replication assays.\n\n\nHIV-1 Entry Assay:\n\n\nReplication defective HIV-1 reporter virions are generated by cotransfection of a plasmid encoding the NL4-3 strain of HIV-1 (which has been modified by mutation of the envelope gene and introduction of a luciferase reporter plasmid) along with a plasmid encoding one of several HIV-1 envelope genes as described by Connor et al, \nVirology, \n206 (1995). p. 935-944. Following transfection of the two plasmids by calcium phosphate precipitation, the viral supernatants are harvested on day 3 and a functional viral titer determined. These stocks are then used to infect U87 cells stably expressing CD4 and the chemokine receptor CCR5 which have been preincubated with or without test compound. Infections are carried out for 2 hours at 37° C., the cells washed and media replaced with fresh media containing compound. The cells are incubated for 3 days, lysed and luciferase activity determined. Results are reported as the concentration of compound required to inhibit 50% of the luciferase activity in the control cultures.\n\n\nHIV-1 Replication Assay:\n\n\nThis assay uses primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the stable U87-CCR5 cell line to determine the effect of anti-CCR5 compounds to block infection of primary HIV-1 strains. The primary lymphocytes are purified from normal healthy donors and stimulated in vitro with PHA and IL-2 three days prior to infection. Using a 96-well plate format, cells are pretreated with drug for 1 hour at 37° C. and subsequently infected with an M-tropic HIV-1 isolates. Following infection, the cells are washed to remove residual inoculum and cultured in the presence of compound for 4 days. Culture supernatants are harvested and viral replication measured by determination of viral p24 antigen concentration.\n\n\nCalcium Flux Assay:\n\n\nCells expressing the HIV coreceptor CCR5 are loaded with calcium sensitive dyes prior to addition of compound or the natural CCR5 ligand. Compounds with agonist properties will induce a calcium flux signal in the cell, while CCR5 antagonists are identified as compounds which do not induce signaling by themselves but are capable of blocking signaling by the natural ligand RANTES.\n\n\nGTPγS Binding Assay:\n\n\nA GTPγS binding assay measures receptor activation by CCR5 ligands. This assay measures the binding of \n35\nS labeled-GTP to receptor coupled G-proteins that occurs as a result of receptor activation by an appropriate ligand. In this assay, the CCR5 ligand, RANTES, is incubated with membranes from CCR5 expressing cells and binding to the receptor activation (or binding) is determined by assaying for bound \n35\nS label. The assay quantitatively determines if compounds exhibit agonist characteristics by inducing activation of the receptor or alternatively antagonist properties by measuring inhibition of RANTES binding in a competitive or non-competitive fashion.\n\n\nChemotaxis Assay:\n\n\nThe chemotaxis assay is a functional assay which characterizes the agonist vs. antagonist properties of the test compounds. The assay measures the ability of a non-adherent murine cell line expressing human CCR5 (BaF-550) to migrate across a membrane in response to either test compounds or natural ligands (i.e., RANTES, MIP-1β). Cells migrate across the permeable membrane towards compounds with agonist activity. Compounds that are antagonists not only fail to induce chemotaxis, but are also capable of inhibiting cell migration in response to known CCR5 ligands.\n\n\nThe role of CC chemokine receptors such as CCR-5 receptors in inflammatory conditions has been reported in such publications as \nImmunology Letters, \n57, (1997), 117-120 (arthritis); \nClinical \n& \nExperimental Rheumatology, \n17 (4) (1999), p. 419-425 (rheumatoid arthritis); \nClinical \n& \nExperimental Immunology, \n117 (2) (1999), p. 237-243 (atopic dermatitis); \nInternational Journal of Immunopharmacology, \n20 (11) (1998), p. 661-7 (psoriasis); \nJournal of Allergy \n& \nClinical Immunology, \n100 (6, Pt 2) (1997), p.

Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. The powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 95 percent active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are known in the art, e.g. magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar or lactose. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and methods of manufacture for various compositions may be found in A. Gennaro (ed.), Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, (1990), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.\n\n\nLiquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection or addition of sweeteners and opacifiers for oral solutions, suspensions and emulsions. Liquid form preparations may also include solutions for intranasal administration.\n\n\nAerosol preparations suitable for inhalation may include solutions and solids in powder form, which may be in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as an inert compressed gas, e.g. nitrogen.\n\n\nAlso included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions.\n\n\nThe CCR5 antagonist compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal compositions can take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose.\n\n\nPreferably the CCR5 antagonist compound is administered orally.\n\n\nPreferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in a unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose.\n\n\nThe quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from about 10 mg to about 500 mg, preferably from about 25 mg to about 300 mg, more preferably from about 50 mg to about 250 mg, and most preferably from about 55 mg to about 200 mg, according to the particular application.\n\n\nThe actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage regimen for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day as required.\n\n\nThe amount and frequency of administration of the CCR5 antagonist compounds of the invention and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the symptoms being treated. A typical recommended daily dosage regimen for oral administration can range from about 100 mg/day to about 300 mg/day, preferably 150 mg/day to 250 mg/day, more preferably about 200 mg/day, in two to four divided doses.\n\n\nThe doses and dosage regimen of the NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs and other agents will be determined by attending clinician in view of the approved doses and dosage regimen in the package insert or as set forth in the protocol taking into consideration the age, sex and condition of the patient and the severity of the HIV-1 infection.\n\n\nWhile the present invention has been described in conjunction with the specific embodiments set forth above, many alternatives, modifications and variations thereof will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. All such alternatives, modifications and variations are intended to fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention."
